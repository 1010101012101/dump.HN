If a comedian had made that joke, it likely would have been no problem for him (there would still have been some outrage no doubt), but people assume everything is so serious, even when there is no logical reason to assume so. What infuriates me is that the masses let idiots deny climate change and talk about how vaccines will give you autism without shaming them, yet they destroy people&#x27;s lives for posting, let&#x27;s face it, a funny joke. If you want to shame someone for being a scumbag, there are plenty of targets but no one is doing it. If you want to shame someone because you failed to understand the meaning of her statement, however, that seems to be the zeitgeist. Why go after a real target when there are innocent people out there who really cannot defend themselves and whose misery you can really revel in? The irony of the story of the woman who took the picture of the guy telling the joke and then got shamed herself is quite delicious in many ways.<p>Posting anything on the Internet, whether it&#x27;s public or not (or rather, you think it&#x27;s public or not) that you wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable sharing with the whole world is just stupid.

I think the issue you raised could simply be called <i>transparency</i>, but as you allude there is no reason when I click on a plan in any market place, that I should not be able to see an exhaustive list of the providers who accept the given plan and a list of providers who do not, aside from premiums I would imagine this is the single most important factor to the majority of consumers, and the most important for people who are not picking plans based on finances.  There are other data points insurers should be made to disclose as well, such as: the total number of claims under a given plan, the number of claims that were paid/not paid out, and the average amount of time it took to approve/pay said claims.<p>The 2nd issue,  none of these plans on the market place make healthcare affordable to those who were previously uninsured due to cost.  Yes, there are subsidies for premiums, but once someone actually has to use the plan, most can not afford the out of pocket co-pay much less the deductible.  Due to inability to truly afford their subsidized insurance plan, people avoid using their insurance and so all the mandate really seems to do is line the pockets of the insurers with subsidized premiums on behalf of people who knowingly will not use their plans.",1423770379

In fact if you take into account the big-O time complexity, then assembly is better than the version of Lisp described in the OP, because the latter suffers a logarithmic penalty due to immutability.<p>More to the point, Lisp is nice because it&#x27;s in a sweet spot of language complexity vs self-interpreter complexity, and lambda calculus is nice because it&#x27;s a simple basis of computation. But there are many languages that make self-interpreters simple (assembly, Forth...) and many simple bases of computation (SKI calculus, rule 110...)<p>To call something the &quot;Maxwell equations of software&quot;, IMO you need something more substantial. For example, Haskell folks can claim that lazy evaluation is provably superior (in termination and time complexity) to any other evaluation strategy. The dependent typing folks can claim that all valid programs correspond to valid proofs and vice versa, and that strict and lazy evaluation are equivalent w.r.t. termination.

Find the vulnerability. Assume that no one will find it by the time you find a third party buyer.<p>1. Look for a buyer. If you&#x27;re not well-connected, you might stumble into an FBI honeypot (a sting operation) because you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. But let&#x27;s assume you know what you&#x27;re doing and you find a buyer.<p>2. You negotiate a price. You don&#x27;t receive much more than Facebook would pay you (if they even give you that much) for a few reasons:<p>a. The vulnerability can only be used on Facebook, so it&#x27;s not vendor agnostic (compare Heartbleed, Shellshock);<p>b. The vulnerability has an extremely small window of capitalization - it <i>will</i> be discovered within a week of use, maybe less. The Facebook incident response team is <i>spectacular.</i><p>c. You need to figure out a sufficient monetization strategy for distributing malware or spam using profiles that are taken over using this vulnerability. You have a week of use, much less if you try to take over accounts too aggressively. Now you&#x27;re going up against all of Facebook&#x27;s other protections - once you have the account, spreading malware will either be algorithmically discovered by Facebook or reported by other users.<p>With an organized crime unit composed of professional hackers, this might pay off. Maybe. And that is for one of the most serious bugs you can find. You&#x27;re better off just taking what Facebook (generously) gives you.<p>The classical fallacy people fall into is believing that a web application vulnerability is worth much, especially the variety most tech companies have to offer. It&#x27;s certainly serious, yes, but it&#x27;s only worth what a market will pay for it. It&#x27;s worth a lot to Facebook for brand integrity. It&#x27;s not worth a lot to hackers looking to make money.<p>The only web applications that might be worth real money would be banks or government institutions (or similar platforms). <i>Real</i> money is found in vulnerabilities on desktop clients, especially memory corruption vulnerabilities, or in ubiquitous software that affects servers. You want to be able to compromise a user for use in a botnet or distribute malware to steal their money or personal information. Alternatively, you want to be able to attack, say, 30% of the websites on the internet with a wide variety of options after you get in.<p>Examples include:<p>• Vulnerabilities in Flash.<p>• Vulnerabilities in Python, Ruby or corresponding web frameworks.<p>• Code execution in iOS that allows a jailbreak (most sources indicate the going price for this is $500,000). Other vulnerabilities as well, such as compromising app store receipts or in-app purchase checks.<p>• Vulnerabilities in Android, up to and including code execution.<p>• A game over flaw in any number of ubiquitous software packages used on Linux servers with root access.<p>• A sandbox escape in OS X or Windows (you&#x27;ll be paid more for Windows but both are lucrative).",1423769731

Students concluded in large numbers that people just don&#x27;t like fresh fruit and do like fresh potatoes. Hm.

9040735,comment,9038615,9038615,0,0,hackuser,,,"I read the NYT daily (via RSS feeds). It is an important institution for the U.S. and the world; the options are rapidly shrinking for high-quality journalism and so I worry about the Times&#x27; future. From my perspective the Times&#x27; content is invaluable, but in 2015 the Times is hurting itself because it still hasn&#x27;t embraced the web. www.nytimes.com is still a news<i>paper</i>&#x27;s website, not a news website. When I&#x27;m looking for news in my browser, I don&#x27;t care that you have a paper edition, I only care which website serves me best.<p>--------<p>1) Design: Look at the homepage. If someone was asked to design a new news (not a newspaper) website, who would design it like that? Rather than a news website it looks like a newspaper on the web, seemingly trying to mimic the layout of a newspaper&#x27;s pages. (It&#x27;s not just the Times -- often it&#x27;s easy to identify news websites with a newspaper legacy.) From the perspective of people familiar with the Times on paper, it might seem familiar; but get outside that bubble and it&#x27;s archaic and a bit bizarre.[1]<p>Also, it hides so much content; why put all that talent and effort into work product that you show only to a few? My NYT RSS feeds look like a different, far richer publication than <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/</a>. Again, it seems like attachment to the legacy newspaper design, where people can&#x27;t easily pick up another publication and so will flip through Times&#x27; pages and sections looking for something interesting. The overall structure is a newspaper&#x27;s sections forced into a website&#x27;s medium.<p>--------<p>2) Multimedia is still secondary: Articles still are primarily text, but now more often with video and image bolted on almost as decoration, and not an integral part of the content, equal to the text. See today&#x27;s article on Tomi Ungerer[2], chosen at random. This is about a visual artist, and it actually has several images within the text, rather than on top or in a pop-out, but the images are merely decorative. The author doesn&#x27;t write, &#x27;look at this drawing; see the use of color, the ironic shapes, etc.&#x27; and look at this detail <img: zoomed-in detail> where Mr. Ungerer uses X to do Y&#x27; It&#x27;s almost as if the the author wrote the article and someone else picked some relevant decorations later.<p>There&#x27;s even a link in prime real estate, just beneath the banner, to &quot;Video&quot;, as if I choose my news based on whether it&#x27;s in text or video. As if you are saying, &#x27;our actual news is below, and video is something we do over here&#x27;. I just want the news; I trust you to choose the best mix of mediums to communicate that particular story.<p>The solution is well known: Most amateur bloggers are equally fluent in text and multimedia; rather than describing something they write &#x27;look at this&#x27; or &#x27;here&#x27;s what happened&#x27; or &#x27;here is the before and after&#x27; and, in the middle of their post place a video, image, or short loop as appropriate. Hundreds of millions of phone users fluently communicate with images and photos. But the talented, professional communicators at the Times stick primarily to text, I suppose because that&#x27;s what they did on paper.<p>I&#x27;m not looking for graphic excitement; they are just communication tools and sometimes multimedia is the right tool, sometimes text is; the Times seems to choose its tools based on paper&#x27;s limitations (i.e., text is cheap, images expensive in both space and $, video impossible) and not what communicates best on the web (where all are cheap and space is unlimited).<p>---------<p>3) Updates and the news cycle: Two things I still see in the Times: A) &#x27;Updated at 4:55pm&#x27;. If I read the article at 3:00pm, that isn&#x27;t very helpful; should I re-read the entire thing and try to figure out what changed? Run a diff? Again, the solutions are well known and most bloggers handle this situation effectively; the Times still seems to be designing newspaper articles that will be published and read once. B) When you do have someone blogging a breaking news story, sometimes I&#x27;ll see &#x27;That&#x27;s it for tonight, I&#x27;ll be back at 8am tomorrow&#x27;. I don&#x27;t have to explain the problems with that, though I&#x27;ll add that the news and your readers are in time zones worldwide.<p>---------<p>[1] This will be shocking to say but I&#x27;m trying to make a point about how far the Times is, conceptually, from the web medium: Consider the most recognized branding element, the detailed, archaic font used for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in the banner. In the days of newspapers, when readers could only type in Courier if at all, the font was special. It said, &#x27;this was printed professionally, with skill and seriousness&#x27;. Now kids can print fonts like that on their school papers, anyone can do it on their WordPress blog, and when they do it&#x27;s frowned upon. Now that element says, &#x27;not a digital native, stuck in our glorious past&#x27;. Again, it&#x27;s hard to imagine a newly created news website making that design decision. You may have a strong attachment to that design element, but billions of web users don&#x27;t care. (I know branding is difficult to change; I expect the font will remain.)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/arts/design/review-tomi-ungerer-bad-boy-of-art-in-a-reappraisal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/arts/design/review-tomi-un...</a>",1423768806

It will most likely remain a side-project, but has a small chance of gaining traction and becoming a &quot;thing&quot; (product? valuable resource?). How do I trial and/or on-board these people to help for free without jeopardizing my stake (hours worked, pride of creation/ownership)?<p>---<p>I created a side-project (to learn a web technology, as I&#x27;m a non-web developer) and to scratch-my-own-itch in the sports space. Embarrassingly, I&#x27;ve spent 3 years on it now (sporadic hours, several breaks) and gotten it to the point where it&#x27;s live and shared with a few people in that niche. The feedback is that the concept is novel, useful, but that the website needs work, especially the design (I fully agree).<p>I expressed interest in getting help on that front and I&#x27;ve gotten some offers to help out. Although I&#x27;m interested in seeing how these people could help out, I&#x27;m not sure how to best on-board them.<p>Part of my problem is that although so far this is clearly a side-project, I admit to having a small hope that it could become something more. I&#x27;ve already had minor interest expressed by a sizable player in the space that they like the idea and are considering doing something similar themselves (which could just mean doing their own version of the same idea - there&#x27;s nothing proprietary about it).<p>Whether it&#x27;s warranted or not, I feel some pride of ownership over this project (and have invested many hours), so I&#x27;m wary of letting someone else on-board with no stipulations, entering a grey-area in terms of ownership. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I want outside help and eventually a co-founder/partner (I know; it&#x27;s a side-project), but that decision should be made at a later point with more information.<p>Some would just say to open-source it and be happy with any and all help that you can get, but I&#x27;m not there mentally (pride, desire to steer the vision).<p>Advice on how to proceed?",1423768766

This form of lock vastly predates phones with customizable OSes and was originally in place to prevent customers from receiving a subsidized phone, re-selling it for use on another network, and then breaking their contract, or trying to arbitrage a margin between early termination fees and remaining phone cost.<p>This guidance requires that phone companies allow their phones to join networks they are technically compatible with (i.e., have the radios and baseband support for). It&#x27;s generally unrelated to the OS or bootloader, as this form of lock is often implemented at the baseband level.<p>The issue is that phones can be &quot;unlocked&quot; (made able to join another network at the baseband level) but non-configurable at the OS level, barring features requiring OS configuration, like MMS, from functioning. This doesn&#x27;t seem to be specific enough guidance to prevent phone carriers from playing this trick, as they can continue to provide technically unlocked phones that don&#x27;t work properly on other networks.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really change much these days as the US market is gradually moving towards a financed (rather than subsidized) phone sales model where early termination fee arbitrage isn&#x27;t possible and collections for broken contracts are more conventional. In general, carriers have less of an incentive to carrier lock their phones than they used to. Plus, some carriers (like Verizon) are already required to supply their LTE phones unlocked due to agreements made to acquire spectrum licenses, so this doesn&#x27;t really affect them.",1423768547

Strategically, FOSS couldn&#x27;t afford to be seen as partisan given that it already encountered resistance from people who viewed it as a suspicious, vaguely communist, movement.<p>Now that FOSS is established, and there are developers that have grown up with FOSS existing unchallenged in society, political agnosticism isn&#x27;t seen as important.<p>In contemporary Western culture, ideology seems to be taking the place of religion in terms of regulating morality.

And thanks to the other commenters as well.<p>I think my interpretation of the 2nd law as &quot;static&quot; (like on a TV) misleads me because static seems so uniform, and really increasing entropy is the opposite of uniform. It is n[i] = rand() rather than n[i] = C. So your explanation helps a lot!<p>EDIT: So a followup question: Does information theory have anything like the 2nd law of thermodynamics? In the digital world we are used to lossless transfer, but children know that when you play &quot;telephone&quot; you lose information (or &quot;gain&quot; it in the sense the new message can&#x27;t be predicted). Or maybe the analog of the 2nd law is the pigeonhole principle---I&#x27;m not sure. But if there is so much symmetry between the two kinds of entropy, is there a 2nd law for information?",1423768519
9040704,comment,9038543,9038543,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"I think I said this in the last thread about interstellar spacecraft, but rockets are probably the wrong paradigm for interstellar travel.  People are right to point out that the amount of energy and mass ratios needed are huge.  However, if instead you leave your reaction mass behind, and use reaction mass from where you arrive, then this is much less of an issue.<p>The classic example of a system which does something like this is the Bussard ramjet.  Another would be beamed power or beamed propulsion, ala the Moties from Niven&#x27;s <i>The Mote in Gods Eye</i> or Leik Myrabo&#x27;s work. My personal favorite idea is using electromagnetic interactions to accelerate using the Sun itself as the reaction mass, and then doing the same process in reverse at the arrival star to generate power at the other end.  The power could be put in using a beamed system or other system where the infrastructure would stay in this star system.  But the energy could then be used at the other end to either power needs for exploration or colonization, or to re-accelerate the ship for another trip to another star.<p>To go travel to another close star in tens of years, you will need to have around 10% of your mass energy in kinetic energy (a Lorentz factor of around 1.1).  So, as a first approximation, if energy alone were the issue and a reaction mass the size of a sun were used, an amount of energy equal to the US energy consumption in 2008 could accelerate about 30 tons to 10% of c (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28energy%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28energy%2...</a>).  This is big, but not out of the range of human capabilities.  And if the energy were recyclable many times, then this amount of energy would be essentially the largest investment in the creation of a true reusable starship.<p>This is interesting, because it gives us a good minimum cost for such a starship. If we assume a typical cost of energy of 10 cents per kWh, and a 60 ton vehicle (around the size of a Space Shuttle orbiter) going 10% of c, this gives us $750 billion for the cost of energy alone.  This is about six times the inflation adjusted cost of the Apollo program.",1423768519

So entropy is equivalent to information as understood as a measure of disorder. This squares with shannon entropy as it can be understood as just a measure of the &quot;disorder&quot; in a random variable.<p>The difficulty is distinguishing the other interpretation of information as a specific correlation, a quantification of order rather than disorder. When we think of communicating the state of a RV as some number of bits of &quot;information&quot;, one way to think of it is that we&#x27;re reducing the &quot;possible disorder&quot; (i.e. uncertainty) by communicating partial state.

Entropy and information are different names for the same concept, one that in its full generality is simply a measure of the uncertainty about the value of a random variable.<p><i>Entropy</i> is a bad name, one that will probably continue to confuse people for generations. <i>Information</i> is a decent name, but it&#x27;s a bit backwards: information is the resolution of uncertainty. Really, the concepts implied by the names <i>information</i> and <i>uncertainty</i> are opposite sides of the same coin: for each unit of uncertainty, you gain one unit of information when you observe a random variable&#x27;s outcome.<p>The problem is that in the conventional definition (with the negative sign in front of the sum), a more positive quantity denotes more uncertainty. Perhaps the conventional quantity should have been called <i>uncertainty</i> and the name <i>information</i> should have been given to the inverse quantity, i.e., to the sum without the negative sign.<p>As it is, people usually use the word <i>information</i> as a synonym for <i>entropy</i> or <i>uncertainty</i>, but when they focus on resolving uncertainty they sometimes use it to mean something like the opposite. In the end, so long as you are confident in you understanding of the concept, it doesn&#x27;t much matter because it&#x27;s easy to figure out what everybody means.",1423767607

I think candidates don&#x27;t prepare for the question as well as they should and try to improvise on the spot, and many are not good at the improv. Having a number that is well-researched is quite useful, and being able to negotiate on your feet as necessary once numbers are discussed is important. Email is made much of that easier, as numbers are often shared in that manner instead of in live conversation.",1395251954

The question to ask yourself when deciding between &quot;Supermicro or Backblaze pod&quot; is: &quot;Is storage density important to me?&quot;<p>The final costs of a loaded Supermicro chassis vs a loaded Backblaze chassis are pretty close. In fact, the Supermicro may be a better option if storage density is not important to you (e.g home/office or inexepensitve city - <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/QfD6qIw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/gallery/QfD6qIw</a>) But if your server is in a location where square-footage is expensive, the storage density is the primary metric you&#x27;re looking to optimize for, since rent (and electricity) is your primary ongoing cost.<p>To run a scalable storage solution with the Backblaze pods you need GREAT SOFTWARE. Maybe a really well configured ZFS pool/custom software/and great sysops? As far as I can tell that&#x27;s Backblaze&#x27;s secret sauce.<p>For a company that wants to run a server that&#x27;s going to be &quot;pretty good&quot; for what they need, using a Supermicro chassis with hardware RAID is definitely going to get you by for up to 96 TB.",1395251923

But, there&#x27;s one big issue that prevents me from using it-- they delete your backups of your external hard drives if they aren&#x27;t plugged in for 30 days.<p>I have a drive that I may be away from (at least, my Macbook Air is) for weeks at a time, and I don&#x27;t want to continually lose version history or have to reupload some of the larger files (home videos and my photos).<p>CrashPlan doesn&#x27;t delete your backups after 30 days (they keep everything as long as you&#x27;re subscribed), but the upload speed is so horrendously slow I couldn&#x27;t upload the entire photo library plus videos (~300 GB or so) in the month I was subscribed. I&#x27;m on a gigabit network over Ethernet, so it&#x27;s not my connection that&#x27;s the issue (Backblaze, on the other hand, uploads this data very quickly).<p>I realize that they&#x27;re trying to reduce costs by deleting data that doesn&#x27;t seem to &quot;be in use&quot;, but I&#x27;m sure a lot of people have &quot;archival&quot; data that they don&#x27;t look at often, but really value.<p>Instead, I&#x27;m currently using Arq 4 (which is fantastic, by the way) with Amazon Glacier for the photos. It may cost something to retrieve them if my drive dies or is physically destroyed, but I&#x27;m not planning for that to happen. I have Arq set to use S3 for my other documents and such so I can restore versions whenever I need to, so it&#x27;s really the best of both worlds.",1395251921

To the extent you do optimize for caching, focus less on the particular size of things and more on packing data tightly and accessing it in predictable sequential patterns. This might involve, say, changing a tree structure into an array structure or changing an array of structs into a structure of arrays. Try not to jump around between data structures so the prefetchers can do their work. This means thinking about each cycle of your algorithm, and trying to reduce the number of distinct &quot;streams&quot; of data that need to be prefetched.",1395251877

These acquisitions are typically priced at $5 million per engineer for an acqui-hire, and more if there&#x27;s an actual product. These numbers are consistent to scale: for an established, public tech company to have a market cap of under $1 million per employee is unsuccessful.<p>Think about that. A mere <i>relationship</i> (which she can end at any time) with an <i>average</i> engineer (most startup engineers aren&#x27;t anything special, as startup success these days has more to do with marketing and sales than technical excellence) or technical person is worth <i>several million dollars</i>. Why?<p>Companies like Yahoo buy startups at a panic price: several millions of dollars per head. That&#x27;s the price of mostly <i>mediocre</i> talent. Also, acquisitions are fraught with peril. Good people tend to bounce and bad people tend to stay. Huge tech companies still do them. Why? Because their middle management filters are so broken they can&#x27;t recognize talent at the bottom. Engineers who are just good enough to support a half-decent sales/product teem are, along with that sales team, valued at $2-5 million per head.<p>And we still don&#x27;t think of ourselves as exploited, when we suffer under closed allocation for a comparative pittance?<p>These startups are an attempt to capture the immense surplus value that we (especially the top 10% of us) create. They used to enrich... engineers and makers, as well as investors. They now deliver our surplus value to... friends of investors (hired in as executives, or made founders) as well as investors.",1395251804

Its a bit like those times when people say that if only you were a good programmer following &quot;proper&quot; C++ idioms you will never ever encounter memory leaks or segmentation faults.<p>The default behaviour for objects in Python is being truthy and testing their existence with `if x` instead of `if x is not None` is definitely encouraged by the language (otherwise, why would it even let you use objects in a boolean context?). Having something that behaves like the default except once in a blue moon is just a trap and its unfair to blame it on the programmer.",1395251521

Another reason is systemic vs. individual discrimination - again, other people explain it better than I ever could but a very simple example would be that everyone across the board, meaning men and women both, discriminate against equally-qualified resumes with female names on them, evidencing that our whole culture is systemically sexist in one direction.<p>And if you read carefully what that parent was responding to, it will make even more sense.",1395250986

I don&#x27;t mean that in a bad way, I just think this person could really improve his prospects with some changes.<p>To nitpick one example, I&#x27;ve always felt that after your first job you should drastically cut down the importance of your degree on your resume. As far as I&#x27;m concerned your degree/major/whatever is a poor indicator of the kind of developer you&#x27;re going to be, to be used only as a last resort when you are young and haven&#x27;t had the chance to demonstrate yourself in the workforce. After that, your previous job titles/accomplishments are way more telling.<p>This guy is in his 50s and he&#x27;s still got individual line items for honors and high honors. I don&#x27;t care. I don&#x27;t even know what that means back when he got his degree. He points out he has a double major. Then tells me his majors individually. Then tells me how he did in each major separately.

I half expected him to list projects he did in school (hell, maybe some of those projects at the bottom WERE school projects -- that&#x27;s the mindset I&#x27;m put in by the schooling section).<p>Then he tells me his hobbies. This isn&#x27;t <i>as bad</i> as telling me he likes to ride his bike or something, but &quot;working on a couple of books&quot; sounds so &quot;I&#x27;ve been working on that big idea in my spare time for 10 years...&quot; It conveys zero useful information to me. Clearly he has no finished books (because then he would have listed them, but somehow he is working on more than one at once).

It is more of a &quot;content optimization&quot; service than a &quot;content delivery&quot; service. If you want a CDN the tradeoffs (number of edge nodes, latency, cache sizes) are much better with other providers.<p>Sometimes, the stuff they inject also has horrible bugs ;P. One time, for an entire day, they were managing to lock up Safari entirely. Cydia is mostly a web browser, and one of the companies I work with apparently used CloudFlare, so Cydia suddenly stopped working that day in a way that was pretty catastrophic.

Any member can create a group, and you can move threads between groups, even after they start.<p>In practice, this means you don&#x27;t have to anticipate which groups to create in advance. You can just let discussion happen, and when critical mass around some topic is reached, move it off into a group without the overhead or interruption that comes from making a whole new mailing list.<p>This leads to more organic discussion, and also makes it possible for group members to help one another determine relevance. It&#x27;s sorta like crowdsourcing your mail filters from the rest of your team. We&#x27;ve noticed that people are less likely to filter a Threadable list into another folder, so they participate more.<p>It&#x27;s also more friendly to newbies, since there&#x27;s less worry that a thread will end up in the wrong place.

I found companies were happy to be flexible and reimbursed me very promptly for their share, but as the article suggests it was a little out of the norms for them and probably harder to arrange then HR or their travel agent doing the &quot;standard package&quot;.<p>I had two companies split the airfare, and others pay for a night hotel each.

This whole system is a stealth end-around to give applicants an IQ test along with a reading comprehension and writing test.  Can you tune your resume to match our advertisement?  No, then bye bye.  If yes, well, lets talk.<p>Then later in the process when at the interview, they provide another stealth intelligence test when its assumed you&#x27;ll know the list of requirements is made up and out of date and you should at the interview express deep knowledge of &quot;scripting language of the month&quot; and the like.  To prove you&#x27;re in touch with the actual job requirements.<p>There are other stealth intelligence tests, like crud app developers and web graphics artist types being dragged thru the wringer about the intimate details of b-tree data structures and sorting algos.  Its an intelligence test that has nothing (usually) to do with the job unless they have a horrific NIH mismanagement problem.<p>There&#x27;s nothing immoral or unethical about stretching the truth because they only care about the intelligence test aspect anyway, and the &quot;list of acronyms&quot; changes constantly including the time interval between publishing the advertisement and when they talk to you, and of course on the job you&#x27;ll be expected to learn anything new instantly.<p>Just make sure to add an excuse to your list of skills like &quot;also other job related skills&quot; (BTW this is in itself part of the intelligence test).  Or at least have a great interview response along the lines of why that wasn&#x27;t included on the resume and maybe you&#x27;re leaving things off your resume like felony convictions or something.<p>Also know that once you get past the first couple gatekeepers, your competition is people with skills who only have to lie a little, and really excellent skilled liars.  So your honesty level should increase over time thru the process.  Again this is yet another intelligence test aspect of the process.  If you said &quot;duh&quot; WRT the above, you&#x27;re a good candidate, if not, well, maybe not a &quot;good fit&quot; or whatever.<p>You do need an actual list of your skills for private use only.

You can't just go off and find some other painting(s), look at those prices, and come up with a number. The only way you can discover its market price is by testing the market: i.e. putting it up for sale and inviting bids.<p>A person's time is not substitutable; one hour in the morning is not equivalent to one hour in the middle of the night; and 24 hours of it every day is not equivalent to 24 times the price of 1 hour of it.

Google interviews are usually designed to test how you think, not how well you can place a semicolon. The point is, it's <i>okay</i> if you miss a brace or forget the name of a method. It also allows you to mix diagrams and psuedo-code in with 'real' code in an easy way. (also, I can't think of a better environment to give them. You can't provide everyone with their favorite IDE with all the code hints, so in the end it's just going to be a dumb text editor anyway)<p>Working on a whiteboard is definitely a skill, but one that's worth developing if you plan to work with others on a complex project.<p>That said, they really shouldn't have been giving this guy standard CS questions. Sure, you want to make sure that he understands why writing his string concatenation loop the wrong way will result in O(n^2) behavior, but he was interviewing for a front-end position.",1328806425

3571814,comment,3571304,3571304,31,0,varelse,,,"Well, here's what I learned interviewing at google:<p>Be very good at off-the-cuff 80% solutions to topcoder problems on a whiteboard, which I am.  So much so, that when they told me to use whatever sort algorithm I wanted to, I used bubblesort on purpose, to prove a point, and got away with it. Later on, I reduced another interviewer's search problem to a polynomial equation that had integer roots when a solution existed (at which point he asked me what I'd do on an architecture that didn't have a square root or a divide function and I replied ""and what modern architecture would that be?"").  Which is to say their interview process is a computer science puzzle game IMO.  The skills displayed here have at best a loose correlation with one's engineering skills, and that non-correlation shows up like crazy in their codebases (but Steve Yegge already covered that far better than I can).<p>So if you are a demo coder at heart, and you've been paying attention to whatever technologies are the flavor of the month at google interviews by reading blog entries like this (apparently javascript these days), you'll do just fine.<p>In my case, it only took one round for me to get the offer which I (unfortunately) accepted (but the tale of my 4 godawful months at google thanks to naively letting myself get blind-allocated into the wrong team is a different story).<p>Google is a great company, really it is.  I know lots of relatively happy people there, but focusing on the interview process is a mistake.  The real challenge is to get yourself hired onto a good team by resisting all the pressure they exert to persuade you to jump into the blind pool, which is a recipe for russian roulette.  The solution, which in retrospect I smack myself for not doing the due diligence to find out, is to insist on getting allocated to and speaking with your future team as a condition of accepting an offer.  Do not compromise on this point.",1328806387

They interview you, using the techniques they were trained to use, they transcribe the whole thing like a court reporter, adding what color they can and a float between 0 and 4 (0 is 'run way', 4 is 'walks on water') And the then that goes into a 'packet' which gets sent to a hiring commitee where a different bunch of people read it (and the notes of everyone else) and they <i>they</i> decide if you are going to move forward in the process.<p>Writing syntax accurate code on the white board is always a plus.

Nothing is formulaic about a startup, but it sounded like they had close to the standard success case as possible.

I was also using a quadtree to cut down the number of comparisons with previously-placed words.<p>In my version, once a word is placed, I copy it to the relevant position in a large sprite representing all the words placed so far.  So placing a new word means it only needs to be compared with the candidate area of the large sprite, rather than multiple comparisons with all previously-placed words.<p>I'd like to try a hierarchical sprite version, where you compare against coarse-grained sprites first of all.  This would essentially be a quadtree.  The implementation would be a bit trickier because I'm also compressing blocks of 32 1-bit pixels into 32-bit integers, which also helped with performance.",1328804008

I've been disappointed with Google's decision for the 2nd year in a row to allow Samsung to make the ""Nexus"" devices as just upgraded (if that) versions of their Galaxy S phones.<p>I don't mind Samsung building them (although I really hope they are coming out with a new build material this year, other than plastic), I just mind that the Nexus phones, the ones that are supposed to set the standard in the industry, are just rehashed Galaxy S devices from half a year earlier, in both hardware specs and looks (other than the HD resolution).<p>I would prefer if Google waited until a new chip generation was available to put it in their Nexus devices, rather than use one that's already been on the market for the past 6 months or more. This has been really disappointing, and I think a lot of Android fans agree with me here.<p>For example, if it's expected for a quad core chip to arrive on the market for the first time in March or April, then make sure the Nexus is the <i>first</i> or one of the very first to use it. If it's expected for Cortex A15 to arrive in phones sometime by the end of the year, make sure Nexus is one of the very first to use it, and so on. Make the industry follow Nexus, and not Nexus follow the industry as it's been the case with the past 2 generations.<p>I know Google cares more about being the one with the latest major Android version, but it would really help if it was the one with the latest technologies, too. I don't want to have to choose between the latest hardware and the latest software. Not to mention that Nexus is a device that is targeted at early adopters, so you're kind of screwing early adopters there when you don't offer them the latest hardware technology, too. I'm hoping Google buying Motorola means they will finally combine the two, and offer the latest stock Android versions on the latest hardware.<p>Also, since he mentions it, I have a tiny issue with ICS. Why not actually close the apps from the multi-tasking list if you're going to ""bother"" to remove them from the list? It kind of seems like a pointless action to just remove it from the list to make it ""cleaner"" (why?), instead of actually closing them.",1328803377

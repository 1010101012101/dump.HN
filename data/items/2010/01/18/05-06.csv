However, the way you explained it, you need low level control. How about Lua, it has a beautiful syntax, small footprint is ultrafast and interfaces very well with C (in many ways you can think of it as a Library for C).

1059506,comment,1059403,1059403,0,0,lionhearted,,,"There's some serious problems with American law. My father is a lawyer, I almost became a lawyer, I've taken a fair number of law classes, spent time with lawyers going over business law, and done some casual legal/historical research. I've read a lot of the famous decisions and critiques of them in my spare time for the hell of it, and I'm reasonably well versed in American law for a non-JD-carrying person.<p>The United States is (mostly) under a system called common law. Long story really short, common law has the advantage of making the law evolve more gradually and less abruptly than the main alternative (civil law) because judges create new law through their decisions and writing opinions.<p>Common law was a pretty good system at one point. Then this happened:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_realism#Essential_beliefs_of_legal_realism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_realism#Essential_beliefs...</a><p>Legal realism is, in my opinion, one of the largest disasters to hit the United States. Take this, for instance:<p>""Stated differently, legal realists advance two general claims: 1) Law is indeterminate and judges, accordingly, must and do often draw on extralegal considerations to resolve the disputes before them. 2) The best answer to the question ""What is (the) law?"" is ""Whatever judges or other relevant officials do"".""<p>Legal realism did two things. The first was that it re-acknowledged that well known and previously fought against notion that judges were influenced by extralegal (outside of the law) considerations. This has been known forever, and has traditionally been battled against - we're all human, but we can aspire to higher and more pure forms of reason and justice, but okay, legal realism acknowledged again that it happened.<p>Second, it specifically blessed that behavior, and encouraged judges to take it.<p>Which has predictably been a disaster.<p>Certain domains of American law, especially family law, are so arbitrarily and capriciously enforced, that there is effectively no law there. Just a set of extremely loose guidelines, and then it's up to the judge's emotions and feelings on the situation. The actual letter of the law routinely gets thrown out, and the spirit of the law is very much an arbitrarily determined thing. I've both participated and sat in on courtrooms where a judge basically outright says, ""Yeah, that's the law, but sod that, it's not right so I'm doing something different."" (This is possible when the law mandates something that would be ""unconscionable"", which has become an ever lower threshold to reach)<p>I think common law is too far broken in the States to survive, and personally believe we need to move to a drastically simplified civil law code:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)</a><p>The code should specify very specific remedies for situations, so parties know very predictably what's going to happen when entering into a dispute. That's how legal systems are supposed to work in theory, anyways. This is unlikely to happen without some form of dramatic change, but I think the stability of the United States depends on it. Judges and lawyers answer only to each other, and treat each very well, and the system is rather an unpredictable mess in many areas right now.",1263793964

You need to declare variables as shared, there is apparently some performance hit, but it's mostly localized to the shared variables, so reasonably manageable.  I've actually found it easier to work with than implicit shared data across all threads because you actually need to think about the exposed surface area and how you can minimize it.",1263793909
1059503,comment,1058802,1059292,0,0,EricBurnett,,,">Google has in place limits to stop things like pornography showing up, with it's safe search feature. This is already a form of censorship based on the values of countries like the USA.<p>You are confusing their quest for relevance with censorship. Google filters out pornography from most search results in general under the assumption that pornography results are not desired. If, however, you do wish to view pornographic content, you can always search for pornography related topics directly, in which case pornographic results will be returned.<p>Turning on Safe Search, a user controlled option, will try to do a stronger job filtering the results. A notification is displayed that safe search is on, and the user can always choose to turn it off. This is not 'censorship', it is a useful tool for their users.",1263793786

I cannot agree with you that the decision between right and wrong must necessarily not be made with the rational mind.<p>Don't forget, emotions are just rationality in a different guise, in an evolutionary context. Take the extreme examples of love and hate: love help ensures the survival of genetic material close to your own lineage, while hate binds you to act - possibly violently (i.e. ""irrationally"") - if wronged, even if that is harmful to your own material position, in a kind of logic of mutually assured destruction. And of course, MAD is one of the more supremely rational approaches to the nuclear question, and is the primary reason why there hasn't been a WW3.<p>The problem with abandoning reason with respect to morals is that you will no longer be swayed by rational argument. For example, if you take your morals from the dead scripture of an old religion, you're locking yourself into a rational system of laws designed (largely) for agricultural societies which often didn't have an independent strong rule of law. If your attachment to this dead writing is strong, it will lead to profoundly unjust positions and outcomes, such as supporting the suppression of females in society, or discrimination against people ""not like you"" (gay, other religions, etc.).",1263791200

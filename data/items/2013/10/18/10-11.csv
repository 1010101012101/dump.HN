Being persuasive and able to get your work seen is also more important than ever. Lots of great work gets produced that never breaks out.<p>All that said, when things become more about talent than resources, it reduces the privilege needed to make an impact, so it certainly has its plus points.",1382093893

These zip files contain executables that are disguised as PDF files as they have a PDF icon and are typically named something like FORM_101513.exe or FORM_101513.pdf.exe. Since Microsoft does not show extensions by default, they look like normal PDF files and people open them.&quot;<p>I haven&#x27;t got a Windows box handy to try this on but I assume there is at the very least an extra warning dialog when opening an exe - even a zipped exe?<p>Not that that mitigates this at all.

6570670,comment,6569792,6569792,3,0,Ras_,,,"History proves some interesting insight to education.<p>Take for example literacy. There are Finnish/Swedish parochial records/church examination registries dating back to 17th century down to a level of individual families. This is\nimportant due to Charles XI&#x27;s Swedish Church Law of 1686 stating that everyone had to be able to read bible. So you can follow how that emergent Lutheran essence actually turned into literacy. From an individual perspective it was necessary to learn because you weren&#x27;t allowed to take holy communion, be confirmed and later wed without reading ability. By 1750 some parishes started to have 90% reading ability. What is surprising is the writing ability. It achieved same levels only around 1900 (1920 in Finland). So that is clearly connected to industrial reform rather than spirit of protestantism. \nAt least my initial assumption that reading/writing go hand in hand was proven wrong. In light of this long history of literacy in Nordic countries I tend to value the South Korean jump in literacy from previous generation more highly, even if it was achieved through culture of educational masochism.<p>Book about this: Understanding Literacy in Its Historical Contexts: Socio-cultural History and the Legacy of Egil Johansson.<p>Take a look at pg. 47 at Google Books and see how incredibly detailed those church examination registries in 1688-91 could be (pg. 56 has a nice graph differentiating the development of reading and writing ability): <a href=""http://books.google.fi/books?id=WBLOVq4ocLEC&printsec=frontcover&hl=fi#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.fi/books?id=WBLOVq4ocLEC&printsec=frontc...</a>",1382092856

Sexism is basing one&#x27;s beliefs about another on the basis of their sex, even if those beliefs don&#x27;t actually relate to sex in any meaningful way. For instance, saying &quot;The IT industry requires you to work hard, so women won&#x27;t like it, because y&#x27;know, women can&#x27;t stomach hard work&quot; would be incredibly sexist. Conversely, saying anyone is free to join the IT industry is the exact opposite of sexist.<p>Unfortunately, there seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding around what sexism actually is: it&#x27;s not sexist for something to simply not be favourable to some sample of a given sex. In order for something to be sexist it either has to make assumptions about the qualities of a given sex based only upon their gender, or be discriminatory toward a given sex based solely upon their gender.

Where John was sitting in a cubicle by himself in Mesquite, Texas for 80 hours a week painstakingly inventing all this stuff from first principles, on hardware that was barely capable, you have a supercomputer in your pocket, another supercomputer on your desk, and two dozen open source frameworks and libraries that can do 90% of the work for you. You have GitHub, Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, and the whole of the Internet.&quot;<p>Which is bad news if your strength is that you are a good programmer, because in this kind of environment games become a commodity, so you have to compete with hundreds of thousands of other game developers who also don&#x27;t have to be as briliant as Carmack. See the app market; it has a winner take all characteristic, so even if you don&#x27;t have to be as brilliant as Carmack in programming, you have to be very strong in something or lucky to achieve success.<p>As I remember Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky took venture capital to take off stack overflow. (And also they had a huge following even before starting that venture.)<p>I kind of don&#x27;t really buy these kind of &#x27;motivational&#x27; posts.

6570562,comment,6569792,6569792,7,0,yeukhon,,,"I disagree the norm that we don&#x27;t teach kids to think or our American education sucks. I want to stop comparing education with other countries if possible, but we do this every day anyway. We do teach kids think. I am a Chinese immigrant. I came to US when I was 12 and I am 22 now. I have to say that the American education is quite liberal and most classes I take do ask students to think more critically.<p>The thing about American classroom is that overall classroom interaction is more decentralized than the Chinese&#x27;s. In China (specifically HK), you sit in the same classroom with 30-40 people for many years. For example, I can sit with 80% of the people for 6 years during my elementary school (in China, elementary school is 6 years, age 6 to age 12). So you build a strong friendship with a lot of people. You work like a team and solve things like a team for many years. Usually with team effort and strong friendship, students are more likely to produce something interesting - everyone can be honest to each other. You are not shy to tell others your opinion.<p>This is quite true for school up to junior high in America as one spends every day with students in their homeroom. When you enter HS, you usually don&#x27;t have that kind of classroom model anymore. You usually see different people in different classes; it&#x27;s like a college experience to me. For a school with 3000 students, 20/30 people will not appear in my next class.<p>Now you can still do teamwork, except, team work is with different group of people each time. This has an advantage though: you hear more different opinions. Except people can be shy and skeptical so it&#x27;s harder to work with.<p>To me, education is not about score. Sure Russian and Chinese are scoring 98% and Americans are scoring 50%. So what? I don&#x27;t go to MIT and people around me are genius in their own way. I can&#x27;t make a good joke and people I know can. Every one has their own strength and own creativity. Teaching children how to think is like making everyone to do the same thing: get 100 on your next math competition.<p>That&#x27;s stupid. If you make fewer exams and more on spreading knowledge, let students have more time to rest and play, eventually students will happier and will have more time to think.<p>When you put emphasis on testing knowledge, you stress students out. I am not saying you don&#x27;t stress them from time to time - you know, because stress can produce new ideas (think agile and get shit done), but we need to put less on scores. This is why group activity is important. Students in group competitions like sports and robotics (FIRST) are happier. This is why we should go back to HS and help students to organize clubs and events. Or mentor people to do things.<p>Eventually, kids will figure out. Each of us can come up with some crazy ideas for the next biggest startup. It is just a matter of time.<p>Inventions don&#x27;t come in a day. It takes idea, time, dedication, group effort and knowledge.",1382090405

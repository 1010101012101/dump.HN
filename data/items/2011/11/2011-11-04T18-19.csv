""The alternative to the masculine generic with the longest and most distinguished history in English is the third-person plural pronoun. Recognized writers have used they, them, themselves, and their to refer to singular nouns such as one, a person, an individual, and each since the 1300s.""<p>I don't really think it's an evolution, as much as the mid1800's tendency to over classify and striate things going away.",1320433193

3197284,comment,3161966,3165401,1,0,bumbledraven,,,"Here's a foolproof, safe approach to losing weight without any ""cardio"" exercise. How long it takes to reach your goal depends on how fat you are. You can safely lose at most half your body fat in 120 days, so if you start with 30 lbs of fat and want to get down to 15, it'll take 4 months.<p>1. Every week, calculate your bodyfat% with a bodyfat scale or via the Navy method (<a href=""http://www.scientificpsychic.com/fitness/diet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificpsychic.com/fitness/diet.html</a>). It doesn't have to be perfect, just roughly accurate, say, within +/- 5%. Let f[d] be your bodyfat ratio on day d, so if you calculate 30% bodyfat, then f[d] = 0.3. For the rest of the week, assume f[d] remains the same as it did when you measured it at the beginning of the week.<p>2. Weigh yourself every day. Let w[d] your measured weight on day d, and let w'[d] be the 5-day moving median (that is, w'[d] is the median of w[d-4],w[d-3],w[d-2],w[d-1], and w[d]).<p>3. Calculate t'[d], your target weight for each day, as t'[d] = w'[d-14]   (1 - 0.08  f[d-14]). The 0.08 is related to the maximum rate at which fat can be lost without losing lean body mass ([2]). In short, each pound of fat can supply 20 kcal per day, and a pound of fat can hold roughly 3500 kcal. so (1-3480/3500)^14 is about 0.92, which means you can safely lose at most 8% of your body fat in two weeks.<p>4. Every day, for the first three weeks of your diet (basically, until you become low-carb adapted), eat 90-110 g of carbohydrate. After that, eat 45-55 g of carbohydrate per day.<p>5. Every day, eat (h-100)-(h-90) g of protein, where h is your height in cm. (This is Kwasniewski's recommended protein requirement based on ""due body weight"").<p>6. Every day, get the rest of your calories from high-quality fats. (See [1] below). Start out so that you are eating enough total calories to maintain your weight. You can find this amount by measuring the number of calories you currently eat. Then adjust the number of grams of fat you eat each day so that w'[d] is as low as possible while still keeping w'[d]  t'[d]. Remember to eat 5-6 more g of fat per day starting on week 4 to compensate for the 50 g drop in carbohydrate intake.<p>7. Track what you eat with a free site like <a href=""http://cronometer.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cronometer.com</a> (MUCH better than fitday).<p>8. Do some strength training to maintain your lean body mass. You won't gain lean body mass on this plan, but you should be able to avoid losing too much of it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.archevore.com/panu-weblog/2009/8/27/how-to-lose-weight.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archevore.com/panu-weblog/2009/8/27/how-to-lose-w...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615615"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615615</a>",1320433084

So far, I've had zero issues with it. Basically, it never feels like my productiveness is hindered by the screen size.<p>Given that the 13"" air has a better resolution than the mbp, I wouldn't consider it a problem. Of course, it's a matter of opinion and taste. But at least one skeptic was proved wrong very quickly. My next dev machine will probably be a 13"" air or equivalent, if my trusty mbp dies.",1320433049

Some of the SPL classes are equally amusing, especially when you get as far as `RecursiveIteratorIterator` and, to recursively scan a directory (OOP stylee):<p><pre><code>    $iterator = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(new RecursiveDirectoryIterator('/path/to/directory'), RecursiveIteratorIterator::SKIP_DOTS);

Now I make use of that and, syntax aside, it's pretty handy for the stuff you get back from it, but for the best part some of these PHP extensions are a waste of time.

Compared with my own CS background it looks horrific; if I had been expected to spend my sophomore and junior years doing nothing but sit in lecture halls doing theory courses and ""practical"" courses in which I memorized syntax for programming languages, or facts about OpenGL, or the ISA of a MIPS CPU, etc without being allowed near a computer to actually build some kind of project using that knowledge, I'd have fucked off into Philosophy or English, too. At least it would have made time for me to make stabs at using what I was learning to <i>do philosophy</i> instead of simply regurgitate facts. But luckily for my future employability, CS isn't so lost to bad pedagogy that it's thrown out most of its practical learning opportunities.<p>My primary take away from this piece, and talking to people who have burned out of physics and engineering programs, has been that a lot of said programs are simply structured in a way almost guaranteed to try the patience of a lot of otherwise bright people who just wanted to feel like they were making progress towards being able to accomplish something more than regurgitate facts on midterms.",1320430877

They go to the supplier, and tell them that they need the screens delivered at 100,100 per week(assuming that a very high .1% of all screens are defective, after the supplier's QA).  The supplier gets their factories producing around that number per week, and ships them out immediately.  Apple takes them in, and immediately produces iPods with them, where they the go out to retail.  This way, neither Apple nor the supplier need to keep more than a week's worth of stock.<p>The reason that Apple keeps a similar deal with another supplier is if anything goes wrong with the other company.  So in the previous example, if in week 5, Fukushima happened, and the first company was unable to keep production up, Apple could go to the other supplier and keep up production, with a very short(maybe a couple of weeks) delay.  This is vital, since Apple doesn't maintain that much inventory of new parts.<p>The other benefit to this setup is that it allows Apple to almost instantly double their supply inputs for new product releases or for the holiday season.  If necessary, Apple can use both suppliers to get 200,000 screens per week, then just rent a few warehouses for the temporary storage of new products or the holiday rush inventory.",1320430304

Simulating seismic wave propagation, strong motion, and tsunamis to predict the effects they will have on human-made structures; predicting the extent of earthquake-impact zones for disaster prevention purposes; and contributing to the design of quake-resistant structures.</i><p><i>Conducting high-resolution (400-m) simulations of atmospheric circulation models to provide detailed predictions of weather phenomena that elucidate localized effects, such as cloudbursts.</i><p>Which sound a bit squishy.

We all did the exact same job, doing second/third level helpdesk stuff.  Kind of mindless, but it was the best work I could get at the time.<p>After a massive desktop upgrade project, we had a little ""awards ceremony"" for all the people involved.  The full-time employees got $500 checks.  I got two movie tickets, not good for new releases or special engagements.  When I think about it, I can still feel the rage.<p>The money wasn't important, although it would have been nice.  What burned me was the message that my contribution would NEVER be valued as equal, no matter what I did.  It was an insult, plain and simple.  Employers need to remember that their employees, contractors, and interns are human beings, who want to feel like their contribution is properly appreciated.  ""Properly appreciated"" means a lot of different things to different people, but there's some sure-fire ways to screw it up.",1232002209

To illustrate the issue, go to <a href=""http://www.zillow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zillow.com/</a> and try to select a house for sale that you believe would be efficient or otherwise more suitable for the ""new future"" -- it's basically impossible. It's not Zillow's fault either, generally MLS services have such awful data that it's hard to trust anything beyond the number of bedrooms. Until there's a way to look up your rating and look down at your neighbor's, I wouldn't expect the people who currently inhabit suburbs to make it a priority.<p>Furthermore, except for a few localized situations I believe that the suburbs are safe for the forseeable future. There has long been the assumption that fuel costs are inelastic, but 2008 has shown that to be untrue. America is, for all intents and purposes, treating oil as if it's free -- the suburbs drive to work one person per vehicle in passenger cars in the midst of a horsepower war (Cadillac has a 550hp product in the ""compact sedan"" segment and BMW's smallest cars, the ""1-series"", are available with a 300+hp engine!), or trucks that make the commercial trucks of the 70s (not to mention the 40s!) look downright weak. The 2009 F-150 (at one time called a ""half-ton"" pickup) has a 1.5 ton payload capacity and can tow almost six tons. This vehicle is routinely ignored by construction contractors and macho wanna-be alpha-males who go straight to the ""Super-Duty"" models, capable of hauling <i>three</i> tons and towing <i>ten</i> tons!<p>For all of the wankery we've heard recently about the end of life as we know it, we've yet to begin to even try. There's a lot of easy belt-tightening to do before people have to give up on their version of the American Dream.<p>On the flip side, all of the attention toward green living should hopefully generally raise awareness and stimulate development of greener products, definitely a win for everyone. We've needed a shock like 2008 for about 20 years now.",1232000476

I would put it this way: try to address not <i>only</i> the explicit content of the complaint, but also the emotion behind it.<p>Why is that good advice? Because people often don't say, and perhaps sometimes don't even know, what their concern really is. They simply feel it. And until they <i>feel</i> that a problem is resolved, it isn't resolved. So it simply isn't possible to resolve things without addressing the emotions. Sometimes people try that, of course. And that's when you find yourself in the same argument all over again, saying: ""But we already resolved this!""",1231999907

Although Joel ultimately decided Noah deserved a bonus in this case, he never outright rejects the argument that bonuses aren't deserved for such cases in general. Rather, he argues that a software company is an idea factory, therefore he was already paying Noah for his ideas.<p>That is patently absurd. He was most definitely NOT paying Noah to come up with ideas for new business opportunities. To the extent he was paying Noah for his ideas, it was with regard to their existing products and the work he was assigned to. Noah went above and beyond his duties, and fairly compensating him for that is not the act of benevolence that Joel makes it sound like.<p>There's also some shocking cognitive dissonance on display here. On one hand, Joel repeatedly refers to Noah's contribution as a million-dollar business. On the other, he wonders what an appropriate bonus would be and even contemplates giving Noah a video game console worth a few hundred dollars.<p>The elephant in the room is that Noah deserved a fair portion of the new-found profit.

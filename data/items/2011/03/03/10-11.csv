Someone might oppose this persecution by pointing out that the person is in fact only 25% part of the ethnic group (one grandparent), whereas the law applies only above 50%. This could be seen as a worse response than taking to the streets to protest against the regime.<p>EDIT: I am explaining what I understood to be gst's point, I hope I am not totally misrepresenting it.",1299149911

They appear under separate headings in the 13th edition of Svenska Akademiens Ordlista, released on 10 April 2006.[1] ‹w› has nonetheless been an official letter in the Swedish alphabet, but sorted as if it were a ‹v›.

2283492,comment,2282466,2283333,0,0,gjm11,,,"> The point is not whether the system understands Chinese<p>From early in Searle's paper: ""Partisans of strong AI claim that in this question and answer sequence the machine is not only simulating a human ability but also 1. that the machine can literally be said to understand the story and provide the answers to questions, and 2. that what the machine and its program do explains the human ability to understand the story and answer questions about it. Both claims seem to me to be totally unsupported by Schank's work, as I will attempt to show in what follows.""<p>And, just after describing the ""Chinese room"" scenario: ""Now the claims made by strong AI are that the programmed computer understands the stories and that the program\nin some sense explains human understanding. But we are now in a position to examine these claims in light of our\nthought experiment.""<p>> human-like consciousness<p>No, Searle is not at all only concerned with ""consciousness"". Searle again:<p>"""""" ""But could something think, understand, and so on solely in virtue of being a computer with the right sort of program? Could instantiating a program, the right program of course, by itself be a sufficient condition of understanding?"" This I think is the right question to ask, though it is usually confused with one or more of the earlier questions, and the answer to it is no. """"""<p>(The focus on ""consciousness"" is a more recent development, and I cynically suspect it's motivated by a recognition that as far as anything we can observe goes, computers are in fact likely to be able to do everything humans can in the not too distant future -- so best to concentrate on something conveniently unfalsifiable, such as the claim that computers couldn't really be ""conscious"" even if they behaved in every respect exactly as if they were.)<p>Searle talks about ""understanding"" throughout. He occasionally makes reference to other mental capabilities, including ""consciousness"" once or twice, but ""understanding"" is much the most frequent.",1299147855

The startup could outsource server setup to us, do their product and as they get time slowly take charge.<p>A lot of startups have very limited time to get their idea executed and make it a real success. One of the founders might quit, the team might run out of funding or a big competitor might make your product offering unnecessary. This makes the first few months really critical.<p>Setting up your server with the right web server, installing wordpress & configuring other tools, keeping the packages updated take a lot of time and those few extra weeks can be the difference. What we do is help the startup get going and your team could take control of the stuff over the course of time as you get comfortable with the components.<p>For SaaS startups our offerings like creating an effective landing page that is connected to mailchip for double opt-in, managing inhouse development with project management, keeping track of marketing & sales with CRM tools will be useful.<p>And then once the product is done launching the startup with affordable PR tools, improving their site's search rankings, tracking with right analytics tools can also be done.",1299147759

Yes, I am aware there is something called Windows Mobile 7. \nThe very fragmentation and ubiquity of Android is its strength. While for US, I do not know how the economics work, but for a country like India, not everyone can or would afford to buy a phone for Rs. 30,000 (~USD 666.7). What Android is great at is tapping THAT market who are looking for a better than average experience with mobile. I mean if every one was going for the premium buyer who would make good experiences for the not so affluent. \nI have an iPhone, an MBP and will now be spending on the iPad 2.

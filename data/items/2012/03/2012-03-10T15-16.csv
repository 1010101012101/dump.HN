3687966,comment,3687828,3687828,25,0,robertskmiles,,,"What's the purpose of this 'pleasure' construct in the AI's mind? If it's able to calculate the value of a utility function in order to set the 'pleasure' variable, and it bases its actions on the value of this 'pleasure' variable, why not just cut out the middle man and have it base its actions directly on the result of the utility function? The variable functionally buys you nothing, but introduces this problem that adjusting the variable directly can cause the AI to take actions inconsistent with its utility function.<p>Without the variable, the problem doesn't happen. The AI values collecting ore. If it has enough self-awareness to reliably modify itself, it knows that if it modifies its utility function it is liable to collect less ore, which is something it doesn't want. The action of modifying the utility function naturally rates very low on the utility function itself.<p>You don't want to murder people, so not only do you choose not to murder people, but if you are presented with a pill which will make you think it's good to murder people and take great joy in it, you will choose not to take that pill. No matter how enjoyable and good murder may be for you if you take the pill, your own self-knowledge and current utility function prohibit taking it.<p>The model of intelligence described can be thought of as self-limiting. Luckily it is not by any means the only viable model of intelligence.",1331395079

Now you see the consequence of that. The reality is that IE9 is still about 2 years behind in HTML5 specs adoption, and you can easily tell that from the HTML5test.com site.<p>Also, IE9 is still a pretty niche browser version.

By moving goods faster, merchants were able to sell and receive payment faster, no small thing when credit was scarce, uncertain and expensive.  I expect the initial rail lines served the same markets as the canals (that's where the business was), then began to extend their reach with spur lines.<p>There was probably some rail demand creation as the roads extended into the West -- farmland near a railroad was no different than that 20 miles away in anything but railroad proximity.

So I knew Alan Kay, who was by this time a fellow at Apple. And Steve Jobs had expressed some interest in computer graphics, so Alan Kay said let me introduce you to the guys who do it best. So Alan Kay brought Steve up to spend an afternoon with us at Lucasfilm. Thats when we first got to know each other. I had actually had one earlier conversation with Steve at some design conference on the Stanford campus one summer, but that was just a first meeting sort of thing. The first serious meeting with business possibilities was that one at Lucasfilm with Alan Kay.<p>> Shortly after that, Steve and Apple broke up. And meanwhile, Lucasfilm was trying to sell us. Steve ended up buying us from Lucasfilm for $5 million.<p>So not only was Jobs alerted to Pixar by an existing contact, in buying it he was to a large extent reusing the business model that had already worked with the Macintosh: take PARC goodies and commercialise them, hiring some of the PARC guys themselves.",1331392863

I can assure you, your stack space is more than sufficient for that.<p>Also, you only have to push a handful of pointers to the stack, which doesn't seem to be expensive to me.",1215769802

The nice parts one can copy-paste and edit as needed.<p>Real scratch paper I use only for drawing angles and lines when dealing with geometry.<p>I recall Donald Knuth stating he programs by sitting next to a big trash bin and writing down all code in pieces of paper, most of which he discards.",1215769380

I'm having a hard time imagining what you're up to.<p>As you're apparently captive, I'd recommend making the most out of it. Technologies and trends shift, but your dreams and competencies will stick with you. Do whatever you want, with gusto.<p>That said, additional formal education is never a bad way to go.",1215769086

How do they do it?",,"No other company I can think of executes so well on such great products.<p>Personal Computer, Music, and the Phone- each Apple product changed their entire space and moved the world forward.<p>After playing around with iPhone V2 I can only imagine all the great products and companies that will born on mobile.<p>Yes, people have been saying mobile is the ""next-gen"" platform for years but the fact is no mobile app before the iPhone matters (With the exception of email). It's a clean slate, and I think the real mobile platform began today.<p>Great time to be in the tech industry.",1215768818
243386,comment,242745,242745,0,0,dmv,,,"Orson Scott Card used to advocate, at least at a talk I was at a decade ago, write it-throw it away-write it again.  Something like ""if you wrote it once, you can write it again shorter and better"".  I've found that to be an important programming insight.  Too often, I find myself stepping off the rapid interation path.  Inevitably, it is much faster and much more productive to write it the awful and obvious way, prove that with some relaxed constraints the approach can work, and then rewrite it.<p>Frankly, I've loved Stephenson's works but they have gotten progressively looser.  I've attributed this to his success relaxing his editors; this is much like a Senior Software Architect not being held to the same design and code review standards.  The result is still impressive and functional, but may not be minimal.",1215768639
243385,comment,242745,242988,0,0,tokipin,,,"i don't see the difference.  there is input and output in writing a novel too if you want to trivialize it like that.  and programs have multiple execution paths, both potential and actual, and can have successive versions as well (e.g. CorelDraw 10.) choices made at some point can affect decisions later on. and it's likely actual humans will use your program",1215768481

243381,comment,243280,243291,0,0,dmv,,,"Re #1, I presume you mean ""switched off"" to conserve battery.  The thing is, a backlight wouldn't really work with the eInk screen.  eInk is an ink technology designed to mimic ink on paper.  Like paper, you read the screen by light bouncing off it, not through it.  Think of reading a backlit sheet of paper, like a transparency on a projector -- more pleasant to read the reflection than have it lit from behind.<p>I have a Motorola MOTOFONE F3, which also uses an eInk display.  It has a light source -- an LED between the display and outer plastic.  Works ok, but direct reflected light (like a flashlight) works better in low light conditions.<p>I think you can just use a normal booklight with the Kindle.",1215767800

6845789,comment,6845677,6845724,3,0,Alex_MJ,,,"There&#x27;s less energy in the wind after it leaves the turbine (by necessity, energy is transferred into the turbine to make it turn). If you were to expand the air moving at 15mph to the same size as the inlet its&#x27; velocity would decrease in the same way that funneling it down increases that velocity. Plus losses from viscosity and turbulence.<p>Technically speaking, you could add a second stage turbine to it but you&#x27;d be getting a lot less energy out of it and it&#x27;s probably not worth it. Something similar is done in the natural gas turbine world with combined cycle turbines, where a natural gas turbine is operated at very high temperatures and pressures, producing a lot of energy, and the exhaust (for comparison: the air/gases coming out of it) is still hotter and higher-pressure than atmospheric air. This exhaust is fed to a steam turbine which manages to capture some more energy out of it on its&#x27; way back into the atmosphere, where it leaves lower-temperature and lower-pressure than it did from the gas turbine.<p>Also, for any real-life physical system involving airflow, even if you had perfect turbines that cost zero dollars, everything creates viscous drag with the air that lowers velocity/energy/etc.",1386147561

Tell the interviewer that you don&#x27;t know, but he doesn&#x27;t know that either (and it&#x27;s easy to use the previous answer to come up with a -way to slow- algorithm suggestion, doing it efficiently and correctly however ...).<p>If you just want to make a robot. I suggest :<p>(shortcut if you got money to burn and don&#x27;t care about electronics : <a href=\"http://www.robotis.com/xe/bioloid_en\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.robotis.com/xe/bioloid_en</a> . Lego motors are slow and crappy)<p>1) forward kinematics (given 3 translated and rotated robot arm sections, what movement makes the end effector ?). Oh and mobile platform kinematics (robot arm is now a robot paw. What is the effect on a mobile platform if you move the arm, given that the end effector is on the ground)<p>2) make a robot arm. Bonus points if you make a walker.<p>3) actually program forward kinematics.<p>4) notice that the engines get really, really hot<p>5) learn control algorithms. Summary : the position of a motor is a function. Find the derivative of that function, speed. Make your control loop limit that speed (meaning speed needs to remain within -x and +x. Slow down if you find your robot risks exceeding that). Find the derivative of the speed function, acceleration. Make your control loop limit it&#x27;s value.<p>5.5) find that the limits imposed in 5 are too strict. Find a way to relax them so that over a &quot;small&quot; time period of, say 2-3 seconds they&#x27;re always true, but allow for small periods that exceed these limits.<p>6) notice that if you limit the torque (the derivative of the acceleration function to relatively low values) humans will not notice the movement of the robot, even though it doesn&#x27;t preclude the robot moving quite fast. Have some fun with that.<p>6.5) attempt to make your robot pick up an unboiled egg. Break 100 eggs. Publish the traditional &quot;look I can pick up an egg&quot; (in 100 attempts you&#x27;ll have a single egg that survives. Don&#x27;t mention the other 99)<p>7) find ways to get your control loops based on other values. For example, find a way to have an end effector exert constant force on an object, as opposed to having a specific position. Find a way for your end effector to track an object.<p>7.5) make your robot pick up an unboiled egg. Get the breakage under 10%. Publish another paper. Do mention the 10 broken eggs.\n8) find a way to do 7 while making sure your robot doesn&#x27;t crash into itself, that generally there is no way to trick it into attempting to intersect with itself.<p>After step 7, you now know more than 80% of the people working on robotics. If you&#x27;re still having fun, I&#x27;d definitely suggest getting into a phd program. Note that all this is bloody hard. Before you have step 8 covered you will be one of the 100 best-informed people in your state when it comes to 3d geometry and how forces affect objects. You will get irritated everytime you see a crane or bulldozer or escalator or elevator ... Your girlfriend will hate you for pointing out ways that those things can easily or suddenly accelerate large masses and cause disasters, and how easy it would be to prevent that.<p>Note that we really aren&#x27;t that far when it comes to robotics. That means that with basic electronics you can achieve the state of the art (exception : battery life). It is not necessary to utilize expensive motors to achieve any of this, nor do you need things like a 3d printer or the like (servos + balsa wood(and something more solid, when you inevitable make a bigger robot) + saw + drill) will get you to step 6.5, and there is plenty of information on the internet on how to replace the servo ciruits to make 7+8 possible.",1386146786

6845681,comment,6829725,6844241,1,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>1. Lack of documentation</i><p>Again, in my experience, the documentation in Scala land is very good. The standard library has a really good API documentation, also checkout the documentation project at <a href=\"http://docs.scala-lang.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.scala-lang.org/</a> plus there are several very good books available; then there are the libraries in Scala&#x27;s ecosystem, like Play2, or Akka, or Slick for example that do have good documentation. The online documentation for Play2 does not match the online documentation for Ruby on Rails or Django, but it&#x27;s newer and it&#x27;s improving and I remember a time when Rails was several years old and lacked online documentation. I did find undocumented features in Play2&#x27;s online documentation, but nothing that couldn&#x27;t be solved with a question on its mailing list. These are open-source libraries, with strong communities that communicate a lot on mailing lists, you know.<p>The great thing about Scala is that you can also use any Java library you want and wrapping Java libraries in Scala-ish interfaces is actually easy and a great learning experience. I wished you&#x27;d be more explicit about this point, because for me I don&#x27;t feel like there is a lack of documentation.<p>> <i>2. Breaking backwards compatibility</i><p>This is a point that comes up a lot, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that important for people actually using Scala. Scala is a compiled language, the libraries get distributed / deployed as compiled bytecode packaged up as Jars. This means that breaking compatibility is really easy, as all you have to do is to change an interface, like adding, removing or changing the signature of a method and boom, all code that depends on that interface needs to be recompiled, even for code that&#x27;s not using the method in question. Dynamic languages that get interpreted or compiled on-the-fly, like Python or Ruby, are distributed as source-code. So by their nature don&#x27;t have this disability.<p>The alternative to breaking backwards compatibility in Scala is to freeze the standard library. Personally that&#x27;s not a compromise I want, because for this very reason Java&#x27;s standard library is full of idiosyncrasies, broken interfaces, broken behaviour and various other artefacts going back to Java 1.0, that were never fixed in order to preserve backwards compatibility.<p>Scala has improved a lot though, compared to the 2.8 days. Nowadays you&#x27;ve got a guarantee that minor versions aren&#x27;t breaking backwards compatibility. Code compiled with Scala 2.10.0 is guaranteed to be compatible with Scala 2.10.3 at least. The next version free to break compatibility with 2.10 is Scala 2.11. The tooling in Scala&#x27;s ecosystem, like SBT, is also friendly to supporting multiple versions. To compile, test and deploy versions for multiple Scala versions is often just a configuration change, assuming you don&#x27;t use APIs that aren&#x27;t available in older Scala versions, in which case the back-ports are hard to accomplish in any language.<p>> <i>3. Opaque error messages</i><p>That&#x27;s in the eye of the beholder. Sometimes the error messages are not so good, especially when triggered by the new macro support in Scala 2.10, but you know, those macros are experimental and improving by leaps and bounds. 90% of the time I have no problem understanding the given error messages and many times you get really helpful errors or warnings about code that you think it&#x27;s correct, but isn&#x27;t, like when pattern-matching on an ADT and missing a case. And I prefer opaque compile-time error messages to subtle or non-deterministic runtime error messages. In Python I used to suffer from null pointer exceptions all the time. In Scala null pointer exceptions are very rare.<p>> <i>4. Encourages ad-hoc syntax that makes sense to one person (or team) but does not to the next -- maintenance nightmare.</i><p>This is a thing that gets repeated by people that haven&#x27;t used Scala, either personally or in a team. The syntax, even for libraries that go over the top on DSLs, is quite sane. It&#x27;s much saner than in Ruby. And I prefer the succinctness of it, compared to code written in Java that often feels like a puke of useless crap that you have to read through in order to get to the bottom of whatever the piece of code you&#x27;re reading actually does. Code written in more powerful languages feels like being harder to read, simply because each line of code does more.<p>It&#x27;s not the syntax that&#x27;s the problem dude. Having worked with Scala in a team, the real problem are the functional programming concepts involved. In Scala you end up using recursion, error-handling without exceptions (e.g. Either/Option/Try), lazyness, monads, applicative functors, iteratees or other forms of doing stream processing and the list can continue. But it&#x27;s hard because most developers are not familiar with these concepts, because many of the techniques involved are like death by a thousand cuts to apply in more mainstream languages.<p>Then there&#x27;s the type system. Scala is much more static than languages like Java or C#. It&#x27;s great for users of properly designed libraries. It&#x27;s not so great for language designers themselves, as people sometimes end up jumping the shark on static type safety, digging themselves into a corner. When you&#x27;re seeing libraries that are hard to read because of all the generic types involved, well, on the flip side, Scala allows you to do things that are impossible to do in Java. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re seeing a lot of type-casts in Java, whereas in Scala type-casts are more like an anomaly. Plus, Java uses wildcards for covariance/contravariance, which suck. Java libraries are often not generic because generic types in Java suck so badly.<p>> <i>5. Lack of general stability in language and libraries serving to confuse the eco-system.</i><p>I think at this point, you&#x27;re being redundant, for the lack of better criticism. I disagree of course.",1386145476

It probably should be under its own project--but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s under Joyent&#x27;s and the actions on the project reflect on them. I think Joyent overreacted terribly and did themselves more damage than the tempest in a teapot otherwise would have caused, but I get the motives behind it.<p>The only reason I replied is because the tenor of Zikes&#x27;s posts throughout this discussion have been consistently of the &quot;I&#x27;m not touching you I&#x27;m not touching you we both know I&#x27;m being a dick but I&#x27;m not touching you!&quot; variety and this straight-up mistruth about something rather important ground my gears.",1386144194

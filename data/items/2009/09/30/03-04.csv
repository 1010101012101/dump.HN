It seems to me like this would open me to the general dangers and insecurities of the web browser, and to be completely honest, my knowledge of security in that area consists of ""don't have other tabs/windows open when you do something important""    and when writing CGIs, only accept data in the format you accept.<p>So, for example, how could this be hardened against something like this?  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=812482"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=812482</a>",1254283124

851863,comment,851690,851858,0,0,startingup,,,"I clarified my point above: forking MySQL will not solve the ""GPL-in-the-hands-of-Oracle-salesmen"" problem. Any forks will still be bound by MySQL's original terms, which <i>in practice</i> amounted to ""You need to pay us if you ever ask us about the license, particularly if you are a rich company, unless you bring a lawyer to argue with us."" Keep in mind that Oracle salesmen are 100 times better at it than MySQL salesmen.<p>My broader point is really about the problems of GPL in the real world, not open source in general. I am a huge fan of BSD/MIT/Apache, and thankfully a lot of contributors these days seem to like those licenses.<p>I have always viewed open source contributions as a form of charity. GPL is a highly encumbered form of charity (it is still charity, but think of charities tied closely to particular religious points of view). BSD/MIT/Apache is much more freely and liberally given and embody a generosity of spirit (""My charity recipients do not need to follow my religion""). My philosophical preference is the latter.",1254282626

851861,comment,849697,850515,0,0,Poiesis,,,"The legal--or even common--definition of ""fault"" isn't at stake here.  The fact of the matter is that they've got mountains of data that say that if some ""random crazy fluke thing"" happened to you, then you're more likely to have it happen again.  Because that's what the data tells them.  Heck, it could be that you just live in an area where people drive like crap.<p>Look at it this way: let's pretend an accident (regardless of fault) actually <i>lowered</i> the chances of a subsequent accident (maybe you're scared into good driving), and the longer you drove without an accident, the more likely you are to have one (maybe you become complacent or something).  In this situation, your rates would go <i>down</i> when you got in an accident.  Because it's not that they're trying to punish you, but rather they're trying to just charge based on the X% chance you're going to be in an accident, plus Y% overhead/profit.",1254282398

The fact that Media6 Degrees, a behavorial targeter is on their site is binary. Look at the source, it's there, pretty simple. That is a fact and not a rumor or a guess.<p>3. 37 Signals has the best possible platform to state their case, their blog.<p>4. This is the reason I created Ghostery, transparency and user education. Every tracker it identifies has a page explaining what it purports it does, who owns it and contact info for that company. After reading all that, you the end-user, can selectively block trackers.<p>5. The belief that an average user should track down what trackers are on every site they visit and then contact each one of those sites for their side of the story before saying or doing anything on their end is flawed IMO. That should fall at least equally on the publisher to disclose.",1254282312

A lot of software is still proprietary, and people are still running into problems just like RMS did years ago with being unable to fix the printer driver software.<p>The software landscape has changed, but software freedom remains essential.

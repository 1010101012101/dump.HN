He seems to feel entitled to ride on the coattails of entrepreneurs and bet on them as if they were racehorses.<p>It is ridiculous to compare buying part of the company from the entrepreneurs to bribing them.  A bribe entails a betrayal of trust.  According to Ron, the entrepreneurs are betraying the company by accepting money.  But the entrepreneurs are the company and are the shareholders.  There is no betrayal of trust.<p>The entrepreneurs are suddenly getting better offers and ""first-tier"" VCs can't keep giving them raw deals.  So of course Ron is sad.  It looks to him as though the good old days are fading away.  If this trend continues, the entrepreneurs will be able to get the company to achieve their own, more modest goals.  They won't have to strike out when swinging for the fences in order to make VCs happy.<p>Forgive us for not wanting to be your slaves, Ron.",1181793346

It's almost as if just because someone's forte is business, all other aspects of that person are soon ignored, despite how brilliant, creative, or motivated a person can be.<p>My entire life I have considered myself an extremely creative person and one who can understand, analyze, and improve upon existing technologies. In addition, taking care of the business/financial side of matters has also been a strong point of mine. So here I am, a soon to be college junior, and I am extremely serious about starting a startup. I firmly believe that I have great ideas, and would love to team up with a team of hackers to get something going. I would handle the business end, but I would be equally involved in development, being a powerhouse of ideas and creativity.<p>The problem is, every time I approach a hacker about starting a project and bring up the subject of my contributions to the business end and also me being a source of ideas and creativity, they are instantly turned away, and essentially treat me as someone who would be useless as far as the development of the product and one who is just trying to take advantage of their hacking skills so that I can make a few bucks.<p>I'm all for hackers; without them, you're really nowhere and can't get anywhere. But there are many others, beyond the realm of hackers, that have great ideas, possess creativity, and who can use his/her creativity to make something successful. Perhaps it's me being paranoid or jumping to uninformed assumptions, but I really do sense this stigma against anyone who is not a hacker, ESPECIALLY, against those who can help out on the business end. And at times, I look at myself and feel incredibly discouraged because of things that I have read and have heard essentially delivering the message that if you're not a hacker, you really cannot be successful in this world of tech startups.<p>However discouraged I may get, I'm out to prove this stigma wrong. :P",1181792935

In a compiled typed language, you would get a compile or link error if the symbol is not found. I regularly write and refactor C++ by inducing compile or link errors to identify the spots in the code where a specific method is called from.",1181791151

I mean, it might fail on 0.1% of clicks, but 0.1% accuracy on a vote is pretty good.<p>I guess if one was really concerned, you could update the UI immediately like News.YC does, and then change it back or show an error if it does happen to come back failed.",1181790689

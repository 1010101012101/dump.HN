For me, it's an education on how not to do business. It's quite like spam email.<p>Unfortunately this system just doesn't work with me. I'm less likely to go in a shop with no price tags on, because then I know I'll have to ask the shopkeeper the price of everything. It's inefficient. I guess if you grow up with the haggling you develop strategies for coping maybe, but I'm <i>so</i> glad to not be in a country where you have to deal with all that.",1218189201

Witness the number of people who will happily proclaim they're no good at maths or whatever. Western culture (presently) doesn't value effort or accomplishment - you're supposed to succeed ""just for being you"", like a reality TV star, pop idol, etc. History will not reward this decadence.",1218186646
270386,comment,270285,270285,0,0,hooande,,,"I think the YC model wouldn't work for a company like M$ because there is way too much drama. Founders get into fights, startups make horrible paperwork mistakes and ideas and markets change all the time. There is way too much counseling and looking after required to really do a YC style investment program with a large number of young founders.<p>M$ would do better to give money to a company like YCombinator and just encourage all the startups to use microsoft products.",1218186594

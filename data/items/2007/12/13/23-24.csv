89353,comment,89200,89316,0,0,scrollinondubs,,,"guys, lemme clarify this- when i said ""deferring calls from his wife,"" he was politely saying ""honey, gimme 15 more min"" because he was so into it.  It really wasn't rude at all and perhaps I should have better explained it or left that out altogether.<p>sean",1197589886

Our lawyer was instrumental in getting 3 - we splurged a bit and hired a very reputable firm in Palo Alto that is well-connected. We paid more than we would have liked for the legal work a year ago but it's paying dividends now in terms of introductions.  The other intros came from just random networking.  We live in AZ but I drove my truck up to SF and couch surfed the past month just going to events, shaking hands and meeting people. I had a list of people I know through various user group involvement and presence on listserv's so i contacted them and tried to have a different lunch lined up everyday. I used Meetup, Upcoming and googled ""Bay Area User Groups"" and tried to lineup a different event every night.  I actively used Facebook and my blog to solicit intros and tell people what I was doing, switching my network to Silicon Valley temporarily and finding events via that.  I met great contacts at the Startup Weekend that was held in SF.  And the whole time I was writing a series of posts on my trip essentially live-blogging it to meet more contacts. You can read those here if you're interested-> <a href=""http://www.scrollinondubs.com/tags/sfroadtrip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scrollinondubs.com/tags/sfroadtrip</a><p>There is no ""typical intro"" to describe - they happened in the most unpredictable/serendipitous ways, but having the conversation-starter of ""so I drove here from Phoenix and have been sleeping on friends couches so i can be in the mix for our startup"" was a powerful lead-in to be able to talk with people and get them to listen. <p>I know PG is a big fan of the idea you should really be in the Bay Area to give your startup the best chance of success.  We have our company in AZ right now and moving wasn't an option so this was the next best thing we figured we could do.  Definitely very happy with the choice.<p>sean",1197589660

The problem is that there are too many new users polluting the community with less than worthless comments and submissions that are completely off topic from what was once the norm and driving force behind the community.<p>Reddit was once a great place, but its time came and went. Now there's n.yc, and whenever this site starts to drift off on a tangent, something else will crop up to keep us entertained. I think it's just the cycle of life for social bookmarking sites.<p>I have been working on an algorithm to solve the problem, but I'm not yet ready to release it out in the open. :-)",1197589608

This will give a small startup team all the ms software they will need to get the product made. They also send you a disc 4 times a year with the latest software and updates. It even includes office, vs, all the new silverlight tools etc.",1197589608

The VC's could literally care less about the features of your product, they want to know how it's going to be thing that will be a common-place word in 4 yrs and you have to paint that picture vividly for them.<p>I would disagree on the pitching in front of a mirror thing. And actually i should add this as #14- I recommend that you _don't_ have a scripted pitch. Have a deck of slides that serves as a framework for the conversation but just talk about it naturally. If you truly believe in it, this should become second nature and they'll smell the candidness whereas a scripted pitch comes off as brittle and less engaging. You want it to be anything but mechanical IMHO.<p>sean",1197589039

It's not as if the size of a hockey goal is determined by the laws of physics.<p>And, indeed, unwritten rules are handy because they can be changed on the fly as necessary.",1197588330
89343,comment,89259,89259,0,0,idea,,,"The biggest problem with Microsoft software is imo not the price, but the complicated licensing structure of their software. When reading pages on microsoft.com about licensing you will get a headache if you're not an accountant. With Linux you can simply deploy another server if you need one, without thinking about all those licensing programs and restrictions.<p>A related question that i have is: would a startup be less attractive for potential buyers like Google and Yahoo if it uses Microsoft technologies?",1197588311

89340,comment,84355,84822,0,0,dreish,,,"I realize I'm howling in the wind by replying 13 days after the fact, but I just noticed this.<p>I would view the sale of ""sex.com"", at whatever price, to be a good and natural example of free markets tending to reallocate resources for near-optimum utility.  I believe I read your parent post correctly as claiming that domain squatters serve a beneficial function by auctioning off domains to high bidders rather than letting fast-moving hobbyists set up disappointing web sites at those domains, and pointed out that the hobbyist could sell the domain just as well as a squatter could -- thus the squatter doesn't provide any added value for society as a whole.<p>So no, I would not ""rather both sides walk away sad"", and likewise I would not agree with most of your characterization of my comment.  I'm sorry I was not more clear.",1197586888

The is no room for sign-posting because everything is flat and white.<p>Also the contrast looks good in a flat image, but would drive people nuts after a while (and would break most contrast requirements for accessibility).<p>Don't get me wrong, it's lovely... but no one will ever produce a commercial OS UI like this.",1341395796

But in part because of this, if you actually try to do anything outside the web (I have) in PHP, it's not all that pleasant.<p>Also on the PI tag issue, I would rather keep my PI tags limited to the view or template.  it leads to a lot better clarity. and your object classes are no longer technically SGML fragments ;-)  This has some nasty side effects if you have a leading space before your opening PI tag and you aren't outputting SGML....<p>Oh, as a side note, by 'escape from the web' I guess what I really mean is 'escape from SGML-world.'  There's a lot of the web that's not SGML-driven and there's a lot of the non-web that is (XML, DocBook SGML, etc).<p>Bottom line, PHP is a decent tool for working with SGML but it is highly specialized for this.  You run into weird things working in SGML mode but not in non-SGML output with things like leading spaces before opening PI tags if you move out of that.

If you have a site with 100k users, and 10k are down for an hour, is that a 6 minute outage?<p>The most useful thing is probably to be internally consistent month to month -- you really can't depend on self-reported uptime stats from multiple providers which might not use the same methodology.  There are also other performance metrics which matter -- if a site takes 3 minutes to respond, but does so with 100%, that is ""down"" for some purposes but not down for others.<p>Just adding up the numbers is 487 minutes out of 43200 minutes in June, or 98.87% uptime.

That doesn't mean we should simply class them as exactly the same, as there are profound differences in their founding culture, outlook, and aspirations.<p>However once a corporation reaches a certain size, or perhaps in the process of reaching a certain size, corporations and other social tribes seem to acquire remarkably similar characteristics - the company becomes an ecosystem within which it is possible to thrive without actually serving the long-term interests of the company or customers at all - the corporate culture changes to one in which the most important achievement is to do well within the company, and others outside the company become a remote concern.<p>Perhaps this is inevitable when a company reaches the size of say Apple, Amazon or Microsoft - all of which have in their different ways abused their market position, and abused their power over smaller companies and competitors in order to make more money. They may not have broken the law very often, but they are all profoundly anti-social in their behaviour. All have tried to lock their customers in to ecosystems over which they have complete control (iOS, Kindle, Windows/Office), all have abused their power over their partners to make unreasonable demands, and all have ignored the long-term interests of their customers in pursuit of profit. They do this because they can, because no-one is stopping them, and because as a collective entity what is safest is for them to stamp out all competition anywhere - to completely dominate the marketplace (at least in the short term, ignoring that this is impossible in the long-term).<p>Perhaps that's just a natural outcome of capitalism, but as we have stronger limits in other areas of corporate malfeasance (for example regulations on pollution), we do perhaps need limits on the power of these larger companies in the marketplace which are stronger than antitrust laws (which seem to be unused and out of date at the present time).<p>We've seen Apple morph over the last 10 years (as MS did before it against IBM) from scrappy underdog to dominant corporation, and the transformation means that now they feel happy to arbitrarily ban partners from their devices (e.g. Google Voice, Kindle in-app purchase), sabotage their own production partners (e.g. Samsung), gouge partners with arbitrary licensing (iPod connectors), and ignore the effects on their users, or indeed on their own long-term survival. They are different from the Microsoft of the 90s (perhaps less cut-throat, a little less predictable), but in important ways are similar, and they're storing up the same sort of long-term resentment which is now undermining Microsoft in the consumer space. For example by banning all transactions on their devices which don't involve giving Apple a cut, they annoy both their users and their partners - the only entity this action serves is Apple, and that only in the short term.",1341394269

What I'm saying, and I think the place that Steve Jobs was speaking from, and I think others are speaking from, is from actual direct experience with lots of folks in the real world. Forget proper ""data"". Forget authority, personally. What I was saying was, look, for the folks that <i>do</i> need an appeal to authority (because they have no experience themselves, or can't do the analysis themselves) the Jobs quote should be money for them. And it doesn't matter whether Jobs was an engineer or not. He worked closely with and led, and hired/fired hundreds of engineers over the years, starting with the Woz himself, and so he's seen firsthand the variety out there in terms of talent, knowledge, skill, attitude, work ethic, etc. It's irrelevant whether he's an engineer or scientist. By being an entrepreneurial business guy in the computer field over the course of 30+ years, at the helm of a company that ""kicked ass and took names"" in at least two distinct periods under his watch, there's a reasonable case to be made that he knows whereof he speaks. Could he be wrong? Could he be stupid? That's not the smart way to bet.<p>Also, related: one doesn't need to cite data or academic papers or construct airtight debate-worthy logical arguments to reach conclusions like, gosh, pizza comes in a wide variety of topping mixes, flavors and quality levels.

Philip and his site seems to be located in Germany, so german law, or american one, because of where youtube is located? Seems to be determined that german law it is. This is important, because it profoundly changes the importance of the ToS and wether they are accepted by simply using the service or not.<p>The case itself is also interesting. Youtube is a public available resource, the videos are accessible for everyone. This means that it might be perfectly legal to use those for anything, including conversion to mp3. In Germany, that would not be the case if they were proteced with any effective means, which seems to mean with any means at all, like basic encryption (even with a known-to-be-known key). For Youtube-videos, that does not seem to be the case, there is no protection. \nThis has to be compared to the needs of youtube (i think so at least, if the case is not clear already because of a definitve law), which most probably lose money from operating their service - for another service which earns money - without having the opportunity to earn any money with it (given their ad-based business-model).<p>Which means that the case can be linked to the discussion of property of digital products, with drm and open access.

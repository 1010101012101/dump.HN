And its only income investors who want R&D - growth investors carry axes to shareholder meetings.<p><i>Market efficiency leads to a massive burgeoning of wealth - for investors, producers and consumers. Look at everything around you. All produced by market efficiency ruthlessly killing off poorly managed, run or outdated products and companies.</i><p>I know that &#x27;creative destruction&#x27; is a popular valley trope, but <i>everything around you</i> was actually the product of a whole lot of expensive R&D which is difficult to do now in 2015 unless you own a market and can tell your own investors, blindly demanding quarterly price growth, to go fuck off for a bit.<p>We have equity markets filled with investors all maximizing their portfolios by selling mom&#x27;s and dad&#x27;s silverware and china.

Real wealth always comes from new technology.<p><i>For a start, hedge funds have nothing to do with conglomerates acquiring businesses and failing to understand that business.</i><p>Hedge funds are a symptom of the same problem, which is that no one wants to be an income investor when there&#x27;s more money in selling mom&#x27;s and dad&#x27;s house.",1440057234

Try to get a good picture of what your wife has in her mind, because emotional state or ideas are key.  The world is largely emotional, which you have to find your way of dealing with. Find out the reasons by just listening. Be aware that the answers or story you get depends on her emotional state. If something is wrong, she will not tell you something is wrong even after asking. People focus so much on the negative and forget every positive thing in a relationship but if people were perfect they wouldnt love eachother.

   - Java/Spring Boot on the server

All of these are distinctly conservative choices at this point, but using tried-and-true technologies has real advantages. They raise no red flags with bosses or prospective investors. They are well supported and will be for a long time.

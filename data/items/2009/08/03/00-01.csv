I am fully aware of MIT's open-courseware and I've watched a few lectures, read syllabuses and assignments, but I still plan on enrolling in my local university's distance education program in order to take their core computer science courses in preparation for the masters program.<p>Could I just read some books on assembly language, data structures and operating systems? Sure. But I don't trust myself to crack open the books and do assignments every night unless my money and grades are on the line.",1249261104

738352,comment,737937,738250,0,0,goals,,,"> I find it very strange, I'd sooner Hindi or Urdu<p>Hindi and Urdu are practically the same languages (though, with different scripts - Hindi uses Devanagari; Urdu uses an Arabic-derived script). You can refer to both Urdu and Hindi as 'Hindustani'.<p>Furthermore, learning Hindustani really is very advantageous. Every other grad student I see nowadays speaks Hindi (Indians, Bengalis, Pakistanis, etc.). Its speakers are usually very warm-hearted, and even more welcoming when they see someone making an effort to learn their language (and culture).<p>Oh, and it's also the second most-spoken language by number of native-speakers.

Until we find a way to replace oil with nuclear, fision or whatever, then the grid remains intact we only change the source.

People here in Taiwan can get PHDs without working knowledge of a second language, depending on the school and department.<p>Recently, some English-only programs have been popping up and foreigners here are getting advanced degrees from Taiwanese universities without learning any Chinese.  Amazingly, quite a few of those foreigners are getting degrees in <i>Taiwan Studies</i>, without the ability to understand much of anything Taiwanese people speak or write.<p>Monolingual PHD programs aren't limited to Taiwan, either.  In mainland Chinese schools, 100% mandarin programs are even more common.

I've been living for 2.5 years without one since selling my Nissan 350Z when moving to the valley from Austin.  One of the reasons the shopping is half-hearted is that I think I kinda want an all-electric vehicle, and there aren't really any realistic electric vehicles available (my primary purpose would be for driving from Mountain View to San Francisco and back every week or so).  The other reason is that I think that what I really want is another Z car.<p>What I'm saying is that I've loved my Nissans in the past, and if this comes to the States at a reasonable price point, it could very well be my next car.",1249258278

4648706,comment,4648269,4648670,2,0,Keyframe,,,"I can offer some insight into this. Years and years ago, when I had a brief stint in web (I was hungry!), one of the tasks my company (I was a one man company, and still am) was given to was producing content for several local oracle web portals. From what I hear, the workflow is still the same. Basically, content was streamed from Oracle HQ in source images and PDF and text briefs and you made a static html/css pages out of it. Then, you logged into their web thing (weblogic, or what is it called) which resided within app server and had a built cms of sorts into which you uploaded all your source files and referenced them from within that vfs. It was such a mess to do it right. But in a certain way it was neat for branching localizations.<p>It basically boiled down to having web sites within global websites (hence a lot of duplicate inclusions, yo dawg moments, etc.). Even the master one worked like that (after all it's a localization specific to english). Eventually I set up a smallish lamp server (prior to oracle mysql acquisition) to  produce quick one offs (gathering interest for event invitations, polls etc...) since it was impossible to do it right with their system. Also, fun times were had with no preview functionality with their system, so all had to be live and hidden in order to test, but some things eventually broke when they went live, because referencing directories and files were within their vfs, and it lagged quite a bit and was mysterious with cache flush (random).",1350140169

I don't have a comparison chart of Optimizely vs T&T features but there are some common feature sets and every provider lacks one or the other. Having used Optimizely, i would say Optimizely has about 30-40% of features that other enterprise level products have (personal guess not based on metrics/facts!). Some areas where the smaller products lack features are<p>- Personalization, segmentation and targeting (I am not talking about basic geo-targeting, repeat users, technographics etc). The features in this category can go way deep.<p>- Industry specific features (Having a one product fits all approach will be hard to sell in many industries. Eg: There is a huge difference in how retail and publishing uses a testing product)<p>- Reports and analytics (every product provides charts and graphs but this is one area where you can keep building and you will still be lacking some thing or the other)<p>- Upsell features (recommendation engines, mobile, social)<p>Many of these additional features are hard/time consuming to build and will not make sense for a good percentage of users but having those will help the product to score in the enterprise land.

The other nice thing about the zen center is that 2 days a week they had sitting meditation time. So you show up, and meditate in a big room with other people.

Screw the company, they say, we're going to inflate this thing, take our profits, and go to the next con.<p>In this new world we're watching unfold, boards no longer do what is in the interest of the company. This guy puts it well:<p><i>2)""Companies should not be run in the interest of their owners."" Shareholders are the most mobile of corporate stakeholders, often holding ownership for but a fraction of a second (high-frequency trading represents 70% of today's trading). Shareholders prefer corporate strategies that maximize short-term profits and dividends, usually at the cost of long-term investments. (This often also includes added leverage and risk, and reliance on socializing risk via 'too big to fail' status, and relying on 'the Greenspan put.') Chang adds that corporate limited liability, while a boon to capital accumulation and technological progress, when combined with professional managers instead of entrepreneurs owning a large chunk (eg. Ford, Edison, Carnegie) and public shares with smaller voting rights (typically limited to 10%), allows professional managers to maximize their own prestige via sales growth and prestige projects instead of maximizing profits. Another negative long-term outcome driven by shareholders is increased share buybacks (less than 5% of profits until the early 1980s, 90% in 2007, and 280% in 2008) - one economist estimates that had GM not spent $20.4 billion on buybacks between 1986 and 2002 it could have prevented its 2009 bankruptcy. Short-term stockholder perspectives have also brought large-scale layoffs from off-shoring. Governments of other countries encourage longer-term thinking by holding large shares in key enterprises (China Mobile, Renault, Volkswagen), providing greater worker representation (Germany's supervisory boards), and cross-shareholding among friendly companies (Japan's Toyota and its suppliers).</i><p>source - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Things-They-Dont-About-Capitalism/dp/1608191664/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Things-They-Dont-About-Capitalism/dp/1...</a>",1350137678

Yet, only 15% of their revenue total is used for R&D (and another 30% of the total is used for manufacturing), according to the pharma industry's own numbers.<p>So if we pay all of those 30 percent units for manufacturing from the tax coffers, another 15 percent units is needed to bring research on par. That takes us to 45 percent units - but we're paying for 83 percent units today. We can afford to double the research and still save a significant chunk of taxpayer money.<p>This doesn't even begin to take into account that 70% of today's new pharmaceuticals are so-called <i>copycat drugs</i> with no other purpose than to circumvent another company's patent monopoly. If we assume that these resources will be spent researching new drugs instead, as nothing is patent-encumbered, we have tripled the research <i>just in forcing drugs to be generic</i>, before taking actual increases or decreases in research funds into account.<p>The loser here is the pharma industry's <i>""marketing""</i> account, which has been overly well-fed with taxpayer money.<p>Cheers,\nRick",1350137094

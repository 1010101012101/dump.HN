Anyway, I fixed it using some of the same advice that others have already told you and a little more thing: light. A very strong light in my room at the time of awakening helped A LOT. The light must touch the skin. You'll need some kind of device to program it or someone to do it manually.",1226321490
359156,comment,358253,358956,0,0,swombat,,,"Exactly. Each start-up failure is a monumental learning opportunity. So long as it doesn't kill you, it will make you (a lot) stronger.<p>And if the chances of success are 50%, then surely that means that within 2-3 start-ups you should be 90% likely of succeeding... so start-up failure is not actually a failure, it's just getting the fails out of the way so you can get to the wins.",1226321229

If I let myself I stay up an hour later each night. I usually work up a sleep deficit during the week and catch up on the weekend.<p>Try the tricks recommended for insomniacs and see if they help, avoid caffeine and alcohol, particularly at night. Only go to bed to sleep, not watching TV. Try getting natural light in the morning to wake up when the sun is coming up.<p>Try working somewhere else, I've been a programmer for more than 20 years and can't remember when anyone said I had to get in at 9.00 am or whatever, and most developers I've worked with are the same. Become a DBA or administrator working wierd hours is part of the job. 'luck",1226320486

Since a good startup is solving a pain, and death is one of the biggest, this is a relatedly great problem to solve.<p>The technology obviously exists, but it's another example where legal systems and business models need to catch up.",1226320438

It seemed clear to me that the ""incumbents"" must have been legally required (or something) to wait till the polls closed on the west coast before they could make it official.<p>And lots of people called the election months before too. I followed <a href=""http://electoral-vote.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electoral-vote.com/</a> just because I followed them the last two elections. The job of prediction they did was comparable.

It's not perfect, clients don't like to have to deal with my schedule, but it works.<p>So that's what I would tell you: forget about regular employment and find consulting/contracting jobs.<p>Oh, and I don't know the details obviously, but try to get back with your girlfriend - 8 years - you have a chance I think, she almost certainly misses you too. Show her this thread maybe :)<p>DSPS is not cureable. It can sometimes be managed with a lot of work, but realistically it rarely succeeds. You have it, so you have to manage your employment to work with it.<p>You're lucky to be a programmer. In the olden days I guess you would be a craftsman.<p>If you need a place to start, use one of those online sites where you bid on work - the pay is lousy, but maybe you'll find a decent client, or referrals.<p>Also small businesses are always looking for contractors - they like it because they don't have to deal with payroll, or even an office. Start local - just walk up main street and poke your nose in each building. Leave a card. (Well I don't know what you do exactly - but I assume you can change if you have to, to match what small businesses are looking for.)",1226318922

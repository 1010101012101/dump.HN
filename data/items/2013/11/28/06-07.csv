The biggest reduction in loc was due to the move from a relational DB to elastic search containing flatter representations of our content.  This basically meant that we could delete thousands of lines of boilerplate and create a very simple processing pipeline to render content, and for this clojure really shines of course.<p>The REPL made the first week of exploring the problem and solution space really effective, and even as a node guy I was impressed with what could be done.<p>I can say that there is definitely a big productivity boost, but as others have said it isn&#x27;t purely the language, but rather thinking about the problem in a completely new way that really did it.  I do credit clojure though with giving our engineers the ability to think differently, as that is often the hardest part.<p>There was a comment I made in a speech recently about functional programming being frictionless for content management system design, this is what I was alluding to.<p>I don&#x27;t want to start a flame war, but we built an earlier version in ruby (with one of the best OO guys I know leading it), and it was much more complex through attempting to model our home page as a set of inter related objects, using visitor patterns to traverse etc., than the clojure version.",1385621988

He took it off the table because in his estimation it just wasn&#x27;t ready. (I worked for Nokia at the time, saw the N9 prototype at the same point in its life he did when he made that call, and he was right. It just wasn&#x27;t ready.)<p>And, as a fairly long article in Business Week (I think) detailed a couple years ago, Android was actually the first choice over Windows Phone, but Google and Nokia couldn&#x27;t come to terms: Nokia wanted to be able to use the official Android branding <i>and</i> use Nokia&#x27;s existing services (mostly their maps), but Google&#x27;s license doesn&#x27;t allow that.<p>Having said all that, I can understand some of the conspiracy mindset around this. Nokia wrote Elop&#x27;s contract in a way which basically gave him a huge golden parachute if the handset division was sold to someone else, and that really is nuts -- I doubt the intention was to explicitly reward failure, but it&#x27;s damn easy to paint it that way.

In order to cohere with our modality of gestalt perception, such a framework must at least consist of Decisions, Principles, and Predictions as the underpinning conceptual substrates of that framework. Rationality amounts to reasoning to the best explanation which allots Decisions, Principles (First Principles — Metaphysics), and Predictions (expressed typically as statistical Laws) and their interplay.<p>For instance, sometimes Decisions and subvert Principles. Sometimes Principles are more intuitive than Decisions, given that some Decisions are not fathomable by all epistemic agents. Sometimes evidence invalidates Predictions, but we ultimately Decide what evidence is within scope of those Principles which determine valid Predictions.<p>Generally, whether or not we are in the Matrix is our Decision to make.

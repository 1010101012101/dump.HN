I know of two software vendors in my city alone that sell project management software to mid-size companies, both offer bespoke customization on top of a core product (one written in-house, one Dynamics CRM) and they are both doing a roaring trade in completely different markets.<p>All of these off the shelf cloud systems offer only the most basic business functionality when you actually get down to it.

The same point was brought up there too. Do these people think it's <i>easy</i> to start a company on an H-1B? It's near impossible. I'd know, because I've looked into it with a brilliant lawyer. Let's take a look at the factors.<p>* H-1B costs around 4-5k, and the result of the application is uncertain. Would you want an uncertain cofounder? Would investors?<p>* H-1B workers must be paid prevailing wage. For a programmer in Cambridge, MA, the cheapest level-1 codemonkey <i>must</i> be paid around $55k/yr. How many of us started out paying ourselves that much money? Or any money for that matter?<p>* A document called the Neufeld Memo from 2008 states that the H-1B sponsor and worker need an employer-employee relationship. This means that the company, that you helped start, must have the ability to fire you whenever it wants. You must relinquish your rights to control your employment in that regard. How would you feel about this?<p>* For similar reasons, owning majority stake in your company is nearly impossible, and owning any stake is generally frowned upon and investigated further by authorities.<p>* Work visas are per-company and per-job. You want to do some consulting on the side to keep the purse full? Tough luck, unless you also are able to get an H-1B from there. (hint: it's tough.)<p>If you had all these limitations, how likely is it that you'd be the next Sergey Brin? Is it any wonder that H-1Bs are not creating jobs for Americans? The reason for all this is that the H-1B was created for BigCo.<p>==========================<p>>  ComputerWorld revealed last week that the top 10 users of H-1B visas last year were all offshore outsourcing firms such as Tata and Infosys. Together these firms hired nearly half of all H-1B workers, and less than 3 percent of them applied to become permanent residents.<p>Again, the H-1B system surely favors BigCO. The reason for this is because it was created for BigCO, and it was advanced by constant lobbying by BigCO. There is no equivalently large lobby, however, for the bright immigrant entrepreneurs that America wants. Brin himself is probably lobbying for the H-1B, as Google is in the top 10 H-1B employers.<p>""Less than 3% of them applied to become permanent residents"". Honestly! This makes me angry. Do people think they didn't <i>want</i> to become permanent residents? Are we this out of touch? This is because they can't decide to apply to become permanent residents themselves! They need sponsorship for PERM (green card) applications too! But the companies don't want to take this costly and time consuming (6+ years for Indians) route often, when they can just replace them.<p>==========================<p>There are more glaring things in the article, but I want to keep my point clear. Do I think H-1Bs are great? NO! God no. But calls to ban it are a bit overzealous. Please, have some compassion.<p>People seem to forget that H-1Bs are the only way to legal immigration for people who don't have ties to the US, or people like me whose American parents haven't lived in the US for a long time. Ban it, and the likes of me are screwed.<p>I hope that there comes a better alternative that doesn't serve corporate interests as much, that supports foreign founders who create jobs for Americans. Something that raises the bar for potential applicants and lowers the bar for consultancy-farms. I'm hopeful about the STEM visa. I like the startup visa. I think there are tons of flaws to be fixed in the system.<p>Please, consider what will happen to us, just as you consider what will happen to you. I understand that America must think of its own first. But consider how immigrants created entire industries, <i></i><i>when they were allowed to do so</i><i></i>. Heck, most Americans are descendants of immigrants. If you call for the ban of the H-1B, please also call, twice as vigorously, for the creation of something better.",1361551886

Fusion is likely to be at a permanent disadvantage here, as both coal and fission plants are simple compared to hypothetical fusion plants.<p>Waste: Likely small advantage to fusion, as it probably won't produce proliferation-sensitive waste just a bunch of irradiated eqiupment and buildings that are easier to deal with.<p>Safety: It'll probably be more dangerous to work at a fusion plant than a fission one by orders of magnitude, but the negligible danger to people outside the plant will be lower.  A Fukushima/Chernobyl situation at a fusion plant would be bad but less bad.<p>NIMBY: Equal for both, the scariness of an energy generating technology is inversely proportional to its practicality.

Obvious growth areas would be flying cars, mining other than for coal/gas/oil (for example, somebody might think of ways to locate likely locations for dinosaur skeletons a mile down and start digging for them) and space exploration.<p>Flying cars could lead to people living more dispersed (with cars, there is pressure to live near a road; if everybody has a heli, pressure likely would be to not live too close together, as that would make flying your car more dangerous)<p>Environment-wise, I guess that spread of population would negatively affect nature. On the other hand, with free energy, we would not need fracking or other mining operations might be able to stop pumping up water, recycling it instead.<p>Chances also are that people would start terraforming on a small scale.

There is the silicon valley kinds of ""cool""/startup technology and then there is run of the mill ""IT"" for Bank/Insurance/Big-Non-IT technology.

A Back to the Future-style Mr. Fusion, which can produce 1.21 GW in a volume the size of a household coffee grinder, is quite different than a large plant which produces the same.<p>The large power plants based on oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, etc. are thermal power stations. They use heat to convert liquid water into steam, which then drives steam turbines. These necessarily (by the laws of thermodynamics) produce a lot of waste heat. More than half of the energy used to heat the water is not turned into power at the end.<p>The waste heat is dumped in the large condensers of the cooling towers, which often have the characteristic hyperboloid shape because it's the most efficient form. This requires a lot of space.<p>So a commercial fusion system for large-scale use, if it can be built, would likely be little different than a nuclear power plant now, because it requires a big steam turbine at a large facility.<p>On a smaller scale, you might replace a large ship's diesel engines with electrically-driven fusion powered systems. This would reduce ship pollution and reduce the number of times it needs to refuel. (Assuming that a perfected system needs little maintenance otherwise.)<p>We don't think it's possible to get fusion power to an even smaller scale, other than people whose proposals and work are difficult to distinguish from a perpetual motion machine scams.<p>If we did have Mr. Fusion, then it would be a game changer. We would be able to have airplanes and helicopters driven by electric motors, powered by Mr. Fusion. You could probably think about the other things possible of power were essentially free. What about heaters under the sidewalks to melt the ice? I loved going to the outdoor heated pools in Iceland, heated by cheap geothermal. With free power, we would see more outdoor pools elsewhere. More people would have hothouses for growing flowers and plants in winter. Canada could become a major producer of orchids. People in Haiti wouldn't have to strip their country of trees in order to get power. And so on.<p>Mr. Fusion isn't going to happen, at least not soon. We'll still need transmission lines. This sets a lower limit on the cost of power.

That interview (one in a day of four interviews) featured a great progression: logic puzzle, code the fixed input solution, code the n input solution, test your solution.<p>The puzzle was (apologies to the interviewer, but it IS a common puzzle) the eight ball and balance problem, where one ball is heavier than the other seven and you need to use a balance scale to find the lightest of the balls in the minimum number of weighs. I'd heard of the puzzle but never worked it out. I initially jumped to the 3 weigh solution, but the interviewer challenged me to keep looking, so I kept thinking and I found the 2 weigh solution. He then asked me to write code that could solve the 8 ball problem. Pretty straightforward. Once I finished that, he had me adopt it to be able to handle [edit: any number of] balls.

First, that a ""liberal arts education"" (by which I assume you mean earning a 4 year degree from a liberal arts university) definitely means you will come out able to read and write to a superior degree.  <i>Maybe</i> if you major in English or Philosophy, otherwise, I wouldn't take that as a given.<p>Also, there seems to be an implicit assumption that the <i>only</i> way to gain a solid grasp of reading and writing well is through a liberal arts education (again, I'm assuming you mean a <i>formal</i> liberal arts education).  I'm not sure I buy that.  The best way to learn to write, IMO, is to write a lot, read a lot, and solicit feedback on your writing. None of that requires a formal liberal arts education.<p>Now if you aren't necessarily referring to formal / university education, then we probably don't disagree.  I certainly agree with the point that having solid reading and writing skills is a valuable thing!",1361549807

It would be true for someone hired as a programmer who implement a published algorithm or port existing software to newer systems or different platform; in other words, improving existing systems. I believe it requires equal depth if not not more for domain specific knowledge to innovate in non-computational fields. For my field of bioinformatics/computational biology, many open questions cannot be answered because of computational hurdles. Reading textbooks won't lead anyone to them, nor would reading survey papers. It requires expert knowledge in both biology and computer science to even know what is feasible and interesting. We want to find the driver mutations for cancer, discover mechanism of gene regulation, uncover subtle interaction of heredity and environment. Computation is intimately involved because observation is indirect, noisy, and massive. Only with knowledge in both fields can answer questions that domain experts care about but cannot do because of computational/quantitative obstacles.<p>I find researchers (I am in academia) in both fields cross-talk too much. Computational/quantitative experts try to shoe-horn biological questions into their small corner of research area, while biologists don't care about computational efficiency, statistical robustness/efficiency, and the mathematical implication of their simple methods; no one cares about software quality. This is unfortunate. It is also unfortunate hiring committees do not look favorably towards multi-disciplinary researchers because one is not a trained geneticist/cancer researcher.  I definitively do not encourage computer scientists go into support roles in academia; they are poorly paid and get little respect.",1361549571

The fact is that these types of questions are indeed backed up by the very research you cite, namely that a work-sample test and general mental ability are the only reliable predictors of job performance. But this is exactly what programming puzzles are (and to a lesser extent logic puzzles). A programming puzzle is simply the intersection of a work-sample test and an IQ test. And of course, logic skills and programming skills go hand-in-hand. Instead of writing endless blog posts and internet comments about how useless these tests are (trying to convince a potential future hiring manager not to use them on you), just get better at them! You'll be better off for it.<p>Of course, not all programming jobs (most, in fact) need top 10% programmers with gifted IQs. It is important that jobs are honest with themselves regarding the level of talent they need for their next sexting iphone app. But this too is a part of the problem. Everyone believes their shitty app or website is going to change the world, and thus need world-class developers to help them realize their vision. Egos will be the death of us all.",1361549252

It is mostly not about the talent you have. One of the guys who had gone on-site on one such occasion had told me how the organization billed him as an Expert Oracle consultant while he was told to study oracle while he was boarding the flight. It is true that they get paid a pittance when compared to US nationals. A developer with 5 years of experience makes about $2.5k a month. They usually subsist on Taco Bells, McD burgers and so on. On the other hand many indians prefer this, as it still works out better than if they had stuck to the indian job. In fact, in many family circles you are not considered a human if you are working in IT and do not have any ""on-site experience"". Most these folks are completely dependent on the organization that they work for and are willing to fight for it tooth and nail to defend it even if the organization is holding them under a sort of an indentured servitude.

Without any USM, the image just looked a bit foggy, washed out, and not very nice at all. I went a bit overboard on it, I agree with you. It is very difficult to get a balance with an image of this resolution, because when you're zoomed all the way in, I think the amount of USM is ok (I like the stark contrast with a lot of blacks and a lot of whites) but when you zoom out, it looks a bit yucky. With a lower resolution image there isn't as much difference in tonal contrast between the most zoomed in and zoomed out tones.<p>There is no HDR effect at all - it is only the USM artifacts that I speak of above.<p>Mouse - see my other comment below - we are using the ""original"" QTVR (and video games) style scrolling which is more ""Virtual Reality"" than the ""click and drag"" that has now become standard. Again, I agree, we will start using the ""new standard"".",1361548844

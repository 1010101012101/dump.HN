905003,comment,904677,904677,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been through the selection process way more times than I like, and have been unhappy with every CMS I've deployed (five of them, to date: Zope, Plone, OpenACS, Joomla, Drupal).<p>Drupal is the least bad option I've come upon, so far.<p>But, I have very wide-ranging requirements, probably beyond what you're dealing with.  My minimal feature set, without which I couldn't launch: forums, documentation management (most content management systems manage large amounts of content horribly--see note below for more on that), ecommerce with hooks for tying into a preexisting license management system, issue tracker, decent search, and reasonable notifications for everything above.<p>Drupal has a few things going for it over all of the others I've tried:<p>* Cohesiveness.  For whatever reason, Drupal modules tend to use the core libraries with reasonable consistency, and they tend to be written from scratch explicitly for Drupal.  Joomla, the worst on this question, is the least coherent pile of code I've ever worked with; Joomla core may be mostly sane, but by the time you add any modules of any complexity, it's an absolute mess.<p>* Reasonable backend.  The database is pretty sane.  When it makes sense to have a central store (content nodes, for example), Drupal uses a central store.  When it makes sense to have a separate table (shopping cart order stuff, for example), it puts it in a separate table.  I've been able to build external tools in Perl and PHP to interact with Drupal in ways that were extremely hard in prior systems I've used.<p>* Large ecosystem.  OpenACS had a handful of really smart developers, and a well-designed core, but there were always more open bugs than developers to close them.  Docs for Drupal are good, finding good developers to work on contracts is easy, and the modules are generally of high quality.<p>Note about content management: We have over a thousand printed pages worth of docs, with dozens of new pages being written every month, and I've been horribly disappointed by the tools for dealing with those docs in every CMS we've tried, though Drupal is getting closer, now that I've written import tools.  Joomla was the worst, I think.  I ended up bridging in DokuWiki, so I could manage docs as flat files.  So, while I have a lot more requirements than just content management, the content management features do get a serious workout in our deployment.<p>In short, everything sucks, but I've found Drupal to suck an acceptable amount less.  I don't like PHP, but there are no acceptable alternatives in other languages.",1256625805

I play some fairly well, others not so much so.<p>When I approach a new game, I assume it will take many hundreds (or thousands!) of plays to become truly good at it.  I assume that I will play poorly for my first N games -- so, it's best to get them out of the way as quickly as possible.  I try to think in terms of, ""did I learn something from that loss?""  -- if the answer is yes, it was still a worthwhile experience.<p>I think this is a good lesson for learning anything new.  I think my first N programs were extremely poorly written.  There was so much that I didn't know when I was starting out with programming!  Now, 10+ years later I feel like I have a pretty good handle on things, but there are still areas of programming that I would like to know better.<p>I expect I'd see the same pattern learning anything new.  If I were interested in drawing I'd expect the first hundred or more pictures to be lousy.  If I wanted to become a writer, I'd expect the first hundred stories to be boring or full of misspellings and poor grammar.<p>For me, the question is:  Does this knowledge make it easier or more difficult to start a new pursuit?",1256624744

Scp a WAR file into the appropriate Tomcat directory and your Java project is good to go (no reloading of the appserver required).

I've left a PHP-only job almost entirely over the matter of language choice (there PHP was used for <i>everything</i>. My worst decision there was -- after getting a Hadoop cluster going -- showing the team how to do Map/Reduce in PHP via the streaming API).<p>I've never felt a strong repulsion to any language like I do with PHP and I  wonder why. I think at the core of are these facts: it's optimized for <i>web development</i>, doing anything complex or CS/math intensive (developing algorithms, doing off line computation, systems programming) is sometimes possible, but always painful. I've played with PHP3 before college and other than what I've learned in a databases course, very little what I've learned <i>in a university</i> seems to be applicable to routine PHP programming. It <i>doesn't feel like actual development</i>.<p>Ironically, PHP seems to work very well in conjunction with more powerful languages: Yahoo, Facebook and others are built with PHP as essentially a template layer, with Java/C++/Erlang/Perl/Python on the backend. Perhaps the fact that coding PHP doesn't feel like software engineering <i>is</i> it's greatest asset. It's a language that a <i>web developer</i> can immediately be productive in. Yet it also exposes what is often tediousness and triviality of most web development. I remember first playing with emacs, SLIME, cl-sql, mod_lisp and UCW: while I was writing a web application (something PHP is well suited for), I felt I was excercising my brain a great deal more. To a lesser extent it felt true with Python/CherryPy and Perl/mod_perl.<p>Perhaps what makes PHP successful at Yahoo and Facebook is that they're serious, well-funded technology companies who are able to attract talented developers (who can take advantage of PHP's easy interoperability with C). An <i>early stage</i> start-up choosing PHP seems to almost doom itself by attracting a crowd that treats PHP as Blub (rather than as a sometimes appropriate tool), or in less refined terms ""script kiddies"".",1256624071

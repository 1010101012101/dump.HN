It is a drain on their health. Over time this has an uglifying effect, especially over the growth years.<p>Appearance, intellect, riches, gifts, favours you perform, even glamour -- who you are trumps all these when it comes to how likeable you are.<p>People bully other people by trying to get a 'rise' out of them.

Thus, the new-found evidence serves only to dramatize something these scientists want because of their philosophical predispositions, not because of their knowledge as scientists. If the logic suggested in the article were true, the converse might be up for consideration as well (e.g., that we can be cruel to deer because they are so dumb).<p>Science and advocacy are distinct and should be kept that way. Scientists <i>can</i> be advocates but, when they are, they are not acting as scientists but as everyone else who seeks to further an ethical position they believe to be right.",1262538887

But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us...In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain...an athlete...a basket case...a princess...and a criminal...Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.<p>> ""Everyone in Portland is living a minimum of three lives,"" says Katherine Dunn, the author of Geek Love. She says, ""Everyone has at least three identities.""\nShe's sitting in the window of her apartment in Northwest Portland, rolling cigarettes and smoking them, her long blond hair parted in the middle and tied back. She's wearing black-framed glasses. The radiators clank and a siren goes by, four stories below on Glisan Street.<p>""They're a grocery store checker, an archaeologist, and a biker guy,"" she says. 'Or they're a poet, a drag queen, and a bookstore clerk.""<p>In my opinion, observing my sibling's children up close this holiday season - especially the older ones - birth order contributing to assertiveness (my 2-yr old niece saying 'Move!' to tell me to move aside so she can sit next to her Mom - what am I going to do? she's still not in the sentence formation phase. should I chastise her?).. has a lot more to do with life success than high school popularity.

It will only ever be used by egotistical idiots and dying companies that wish to sear a scarlet letter into their code -- <i>noone but I may profit directly from this work</i> -- as you still retain copyright by default. Is the AGPL transitive across the network the way the GPL is by linking? It seems to me like either answer would show how poorly considered it is as a license.",1262538694

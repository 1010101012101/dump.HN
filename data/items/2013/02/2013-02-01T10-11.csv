Quoting an item from the snakeoil markers list

       This is the most popular method. It has a good 
       mass appeal as it clearly implies that your 
       opponent is a complete idiot and puts him in a 
       position of needing to prove the opposite.

  2. Gutmann Sound Wave Therapy quote

       Whenever someone thinks that they can replace 
       SSL/SSH with something much better that they 
       designed this morning over coffee, their computer 
       speakers should generate some sort of penis-shaped 
       sound wave and plunge it repeatedly into their 
       skulls until they achieve enlightenment.

       This is as great, arrogant, includes a ""penis"" 
       and generally makes first-time impression. It
       can't be used too often unfortunately.

  3. Invoking Kerckhoffs's principle and alike

       This is a sophisticated way. Don't really need 
       to understand what the term is or if it applies 
       in a given case. The idea is to just dazzle the 
       opponent with obscure terminology to show they 
       don't know a shit about cryptography.

One aspect of this that <i>is</i> pretty doable and far more important than being a C++ Grandmaster is knowing how to implement the pieces that get basic code (in any language) from text file to the registers on your x86-64 CPU with a Linux kernel managing your program and others.<p>I had a real-time operating systems course a few years ago in which we developed a simple real-time kernel running directly on an arm9 microcontroller board. The toolchain of cross-compiling with gcc and programming the device (and creating the required linker file for the architecture and bootup assembly) was fortunately done for us with source available, and we did a high-level overview of how openOCD works and a whirlwind tour near the end of the course of how we might compile a program independent of our RTOS kernel's program and load the separate program from SD card with the RTOS and run it. We talked about elf files and related topics but didn't go too deep--it'd be nice to revisit some of the topics and especially in the context of Linux.

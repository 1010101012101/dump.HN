No matter how much/hard you work, without being able to chuck this aside, every failure will be magnified and your successes will be mitigated to an irrational degree.<p>The fact of the matter is the road to mastery is paved with tons of mistakes, tons of situations where you will feel like an absolute moron.  You have to learn to reframe those moments and treasure them, because they are signals that you are encountering moments of true growth.  Learn to compete against your own competence and not others.  You don't know what they've been through to get where they are.<p>Whenever something seems unreasonably tough, break it down into simpler problems to digest.  Hack the art of learning itself.

But if someone comes along with different preferences for languages/tools, that's not to say we could not adapt.  And, likewise I would anticipate that if someone comes along with a high interest level but without the requisite experience with, say, PHP, that it could be learned from their end.<p>I hope by leaving it this open-ended I don't discourage people from inquiring, but I guess my point is that we are more interested in finding the right people with the right mix of skills and interest and I think some of the other details can be worked out after.",1354477470

They don't have to be close friends, and they don't need to share my career or understand the work I do as a web developer. Most of the programmer friends I would sling code with on a weekend project are global  scattered across the world. Whereas, many of the friends I hang out with the most locally use feature phones, have old or no computers, and think Twitter is pointless.<p>But that doesn't matter because what I need them for is to sit down and have a good conversation. Or play a game of table tennis. Or ride our bikes out to the suburbs and back. If I don't get these kinds of outlets, a week spent sitting down and coding leaves me feeling strangely unphysical, unhinged from the world around me.<p>I've grappled with the local/global issue because my life does feel like a duality, where local (mostly offline) and global (online) are separate.

In particular they almost had a mental block when it came to learning something first in order to achieve a secondary goal.<p>One story I heard was a student who was failing English composition repeatedly. The person failing's attitude was ""I have to have this to get my degree, but frankly I don't give a flying f*ck about English composition."" Absolutely no amount of work, practice, tutoring, or study helped. The only thing that worked, was getting past the 'I have to do this but don't want to' attitude was to find some small way that learning composition could become an interesting thing to do.<p>Thus the question, and now a corollary, is there any subject area you know really well?

I like to compare learning in University and schools similar to how memory works in computers. When you are taking a course it is similar to transferring data over a slow 28 kbps modem onto the computer, the process is slow and frustrating however as the course goes on and you understand the material better it starts to percolate up to faster caches. When you write a final exam the material is in the L1 cache, you can instantaneously rattle off answers to complex problems like it's no one's business, there's a question on Red-Black Tree deletion- no problem, question about quick select - too easy! 5 years go by and you've not touched the subject in any meaningful way so of-course if someone asks you to write a Red-Black Tree or implement Quick Select you probably will not be able to do it from the top of your head. There's a cache miss as the material is no longer in the L1 cache, you have to go down to perhaps the harddrive, which involves dusting off that copy of CLRS and reviewing what all the cases of a Red-Black tree insertion and deletion are and within a couple of hours you'll be able to start implementing it. Sure it's not the same as writing the answer in 15 minutes on the exam but it's significantly faster than learning the material for the first time which would the equivalent of getting data over a network. This process works well enough, there's little that you've learned a long time ago that you can't pick up again in a relatively short amount of time.<p>This property of brain to forget less use facts to make room for what you use more often has been acquired over a very long period of evolution. I don't know what schools can do to make sure that the students NEVER FORGET what they learn in a class. And imo to expect that is completely unreasonable.",1354475985

Why would they repay it early?\nBecause the DOE loan had restrictive agreements that prevented Tesla to stay competitive.<p>From page 44 of their May 10th Quarterly Report SEC Filing:<p>""Our DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among others, a requirement that the project be conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the ATVM Program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, prepay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business and enter into certain restrictive agreements. These restrictions may limit our ability to operate our business and may cause us to take actions or prevent us from taking actions we believe are necessary from a competitive standpoint or that we otherwise believe are necessary to grow our business. In addition, our DOE Loan Facility also contains a variety of customary financial covenants, including covenants related to current ratio, leverage ratio, interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio. We modified certain of these covenants in February 2012, September 2012, and again in March 2013.""",1369277838

RSA is used today for SSH keys.<p>How about links supporting the claims about NSA?  I don't doubt they're trying to break any encryption as far as possible, but the statement that they definitely can break anything needs some evidence.",1369274882

It's just their existing JIT with more information and a few new tricks. Among other things, this means that it doesn't yet have a lot of the fancy optimizations that C/C++ compilers typically have in their backends, like clever instruction selection or register allocation. It's already impressively fast, and it has the potential to get even faster.",1369274633

The day to day of an average working developer is way different than you might expect from going through a university CS program. Really, on the job training is already happening, the cost is just being absorbed with the first n months of a junior developer starting a job, so it's currently hidden.",1369274590

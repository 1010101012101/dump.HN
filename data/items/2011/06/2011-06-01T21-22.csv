You could have gotten the drugs for free without cash, credit, bitcoins, goats, bushels of corn, or anything. It's still illegal to have heroin.<p>With Silk Road, the drugs have to go somewhere.

(I don't know if this is the metric you used, but I imagine the following protocol could be adapted regardless; as long as you kept the data.)<p>Take the bottom 5 scoring startups that you funded - i.e. the ones that just made it. Now compare their outcomes to the next 5 --- i.e. the top 5 scoring startups that didn't get funded.<p>If you see a significant difference, that could show that being a part of YC adds tremendous value to a company. On the other hand, this sort of analysis is really hard because the data points are so few, and the noise in the data so high (the volatility is just too much to make meaningful conclusions).<p>It's still an interesting experiment to run, because there is a chance that being a part of YC adds just such a large amount of value that it still comes out in the data.<p>This sounds like a good instrumental-variable exercise for finding out whether the YC branding adds a significant amount of value to investors.",1306965545

We started our company a couple months back, and the idea of applying to Y Combinator and/or seeking funding popped up. We decided to just work part-time and spend the rest of the time working on our product. From my understanding, I thought that most VCs/incubators don't really go for the gaming startup whose plan is to just create and publish games (which is what my brother and I are doing), since most gaming companies don't really ""explode"" and get bought out. Did you guys do anything specific when you pitched your startup to YC? How did you convince them to fund a gaming startup?",1306965485

We have many instances of this in ancient history; and Francesco Maria did the same thing quite recently, when, marching to attack Urbino, he left ten hostile cities behind him without paying the least attention to them.<p>You can very well replace ""fortress"" with ""battleship"" and the idea is the same.<p>Anyway, I highly recommend the book, and you're mentioning somth about the US Army learning from the Germans' mistakes. Well, I can tell you that they certainly did not learn anything from reading Machiavelli, otherwise they wouldn't have trusted Karzai in Afghanistan (there's a chapter called ""How dangerous it is to trust to the representations of exiles""), not to mention trying to conquer peace by bribing everyone involved in ruling present Afghanistan (there's also a chapter for it: ""Republics and princes that are really powerful do not purchase alliances by money, but by their valor and the reputation of their armies"") or not doing anything about Abu Ghraib (""How dangerous it is for a republic or a prince not to avenge a public or a private injury"").<p>Here's the English translation of this great book: <a href=""http://oll.libertyfund.org/simple.php?id=775"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oll.libertyfund.org/simple.php?id=775</a>",1306965299

Experience / education / skills related to information retrieval, machine learning, social-network-analysis, text-mining, data-mining, etc.<p>Alternatively, same thing about programming languages, but deep knowledge of business intelligence, master data management, SOA, etc.<p>For a non-technical co-founder:<p>Deep knowledge and extensive experience in marketing related to B2B enterprise software would top the list.  Understanding of market segmentation, positioning, differentiation, etc. would also be important.  Some experience as a sales person, with demonstrated ability to close sales wouldn't hurt either.

At the moment, the current initiative is based on open source ""Enterprise 2.0"" software (although perhaps taking a broad view of what ""Enterprise 2.0"" means).   Basically, enterprise search / information retrieval / knowledge management woven together with social-networking & machine-learning to solve problems related to finding, filtering, retrieving, analyzing, and routing information in an organization.<p><i>areas of interest</i><p>JVM languages: Java, Scala, Groovy, Clojure.  Big Data tools like Hadoop, HBase, etc.  Machine learning libraries: Mahout, Mallet, Weka, etc.  Information retrieval, including libraries / tools like Lucene, Solr, OpenNLP, UIMA, GATE, etc.  Semantic Web / Linked Data.  Inductive Logic Programming.<p>Ping me if you're interested, and I can send you the link to a more detailed ""executive summary.""  and/or answer any questions.<p>Edit: also, for any co-founder, tech or otherwise, Good Things would be: a bit of a brash attitude, a healthy dose of skepticism, dislike for authority, convention and tradition, and at least a passing interest in heavy metal music.

""Moorish"" can mean lots of different ethnic groups, some but not all of whom look ""black"".<p>I didn't know about these pink-skinned American indigenous people. Where can I learn more?<p>Uruguay definitely has a larger ""white"" population than Argentina.<p>It is certainly true that most people don't speak French as their native language in Latin America.  But I didn't say they did. I said that most people in Latin America do speak one of French, Spanish, or Portuguese. I included French to avoid the debate about whether Haiti and French Guiana are part of Latin America. Adding more Romance languages to the list (Romansch! Ladino!) wouldn't make the statement less true.  That's simple logic.<p>Suriname, Belize, and Guyana aren't part of Latin America, so they're irrelevant.<p>The numbers you quote for Bolivia are for <i>primary</i> language: 20% of Bolivians <i>primarily</i> speak Quechua.  A much larger number speak primarily Spanish but also Quechua. I suspect the same thing is true of the other statistics you cite.<p>Your statistics for Argentina are a good demonstration of how Argentina is much less American (and more European) than the rest of the continent. In Peru, 20% of the people primarily speak Quechua; the Quechua-speaking community you mention in Santiago del Estero, by contrast, is 0.25% of the Argentine population, proportionally 80 times smaller.<p>There is indeed a wealth of variety in each country, even in Argentina, but Argentina's American heritage, in terms of language, genes, and religion, is extremely marginal here in the capital, and marginal even in the rest of the country.<p>> And just to be clear, very few Catholics believe in Catholic saints that correspond to ""American gods"". And if by ""American religions"" you mean ""indigenous religions"", then, no.<p>There are lots of examples of syncretic saint/American-god combinations.

I have been central in the development, deployment, and maintenance of 3 production websites and 1 production web app.  Here is a little background on a couple of my previous projects:<p>At one company, I inherited the companys existing intranet project management Rails web app (<a href=""http://metro-tek.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metro-tek.org</a>). I added major functionality including timesheets for payroll (covered by unit tests), automated email reporting, model and form validation, and PDF rendering. I fixed bugs and set up automated error notifications, backups, and deployment. I also wireframed, programmed and deployed a new corporate website (<a href=""http://metroelectrical.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metroelectrical.com</a>) written in Rails. I developed an internal CMS platform to update the website, and integrated CopyCopter for production copy editing.<p>For my freelance website (<a href=""http://soliddesigngroup.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://soliddesigngroup.net</a>), I developed a custom blog platform and CMS for internal use. I developed the information hierarchy and wireframed the website. I translated the website from a PSD layout file into production code, including social media integration, server and client-side form validation, and dynamic front end programming. I created custom jQuery plugins, and set up error notification, automatic backups, and automated deployment.<p>Here is a sampling of the ""best practices"" software I roll in my Rails stack:<p><pre><code>  * web server - Nginx + Passenger
  * version control - Git + Github
  * automated deploys - Capistrano
  * error notification - Hoptoad
  * automated backup - Backup
  * cron jobs - Whenever
  * HTML/CSS templating - Haml/Sass/Compass
  * Production copy editing - Copycopter

That's not to say that 3D models are always superior.  I love pixel art.  I think the old, 2D Sam & Max looked a lot better than the new, 3D models that Telltale Games are using.  Still, the creator of the cacodemon model actually strikes me as the better artist.  Also, it's not because it's new or fresh.  The 3D model looks almost quaint compared to most modern productions.  It does, however, strike me as more malevolent and sinister, possibly due to the shape of the mouth and the relative size of the eye.<p>For the record, I'm not posting this as a critique of your tastes.

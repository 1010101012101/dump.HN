In addition, to improving retention rates (as you are forced to re-read the highlighted passage), you submit them to the site for ranking, and get to revisit them at your leisure. This would essentially allow you to refresh your memory as to the contents of a certain book (instead of rereading it entirely). Moreover, you'd help others who don't have time to read the book (and only want to see its gist).<p>Your side project is pretty neat.

'Yes, I know 3 Michelin stars is very hard to get, but this must've been in the last 20 or 30 years - how could Michelin have deprived <i>Japan</i> of any 3-star rankings for so long after WWII? Their restaurants are not unusually better these days than they were over the last century or two.'<p>The obvious answer is that Michelin didn't have any real presence but began ramping up relatively recently (perhaps during the bubble).

3440414,comment,3439528,3440362,7,0,jiggy2011,,,"Well there's a few reasons.<p>Firstly high quality games (AAA or even professional indie titles) require a huge amount of time and specialist skills to develop including some (art, music etc) that are not usually possessed by developers themselves.<p>Secondly the usefulness of a game is pretty low, playing games by and large will not help you do another task which makes you money (Dev tools , libs and creative software will).
Also their perceived entertainment value degrades over time relative to other newer games with better graphics etc.
Also you are unlikely to play any one game for a massive amount of time without becoming bored of it and wanting something else.<p>Most open source software is developed either because.<p>1) There is an economic reason to pay somebody to do it for you, for example if you are facebook and you use allot of PHP it is in your economic interest for PHP to be as good as possible. If you are IBM it is in your interest for Linux to be as good as possible so you can sell servers based on it.<p>This doesn't really exist with games since there are less people making money from the gaming market who are not game developers, I can't think of a good economic reason to pay somebody else to build or improve on an open source game. This is because games make money from either charging one off for the game or by including adverts (which could be removed in a fork of an open source version). The only other model is selling subscriptions services (Wow) etc but then you are subsidizing the development of the game and another company could simply launch their own game servers for your game without subsidizing development and have an economic advantage.<p>2) You are ""scratching an itch"", this is partially valid as evidenced by the large numbers of people who <i>start</i> projects to build open source games.  But due to reasons outlined above they will eventually find that either they lack the skills or that it is not an economic investment of their time.<p>If you build some office software than only you and a handful of others like to use than that may be a good investment of your time because you <i>need</i> an office suite and you will get many hours use out of it. If you build a game that few other people play this is probably not going to feel like a good use of time.<p>There are plenty of open source tools for game developers (engines etc) presumably these were built by game developers to scratch their own itch for a high quality free engine that was then used in a commercial game.",1326054176

Basically, a method can have inputs (parameters) and outputs (return values). So if you have an interface:<p><pre><code>    public void IEnumerable<T>
    {
      IEnumerator<T> GetEnumerator();
    }

</code></pre>
The T type is only used in outputs in all the members. Therefore it can be declared with the `out` directive (i.e. public void IEnumerable<out T>). Covariance & contravariance doesn't work with classes, only with interfaces & delegates. Consider this delegate:<p><pre><code>    public delegate void Action<in T>(T obj);
</code></pre>
This can be declared with covariance (the in directive) because it only uses T in it's inputs. So an Action<string> can be passed into a method that takes Action<object>.<p>Also, note that this doesn't work with T Func<T>(T obj) because it takes T as input & returns it (output). However, it does work with TReturn Func<in T, out TReturn>(T obj) because neither T nor TReturn is taken as both input & output.<p>Does this make more sense?

3440370,comment,3439812,3440254,6,0,JangoSteve,,,"Really? ""It brings Android to your TV"". Have you ever used an Android device? I'll be your tour guide.<p><i>AppleTV lets you choose from tens of thousands of movies and TV series to rent or buy.</i><p>The Android Market [1] is the ""app store"" of Android devices (we also have the Amazon App Store [2]). You can buy from tens of thousands of apps, movies, and books. It doesn't have TV shows, but the Netflix [3] and Hulu [4] apps do. Also, the Kindle currently supports Amazon's Instant Video streaming [5], so it's probably only a matter of time before other Android devices support it. Then there are all the less conventional apps for streaming TV [6].<p><i>It can stream any file you have in your iTunes library on your Mac and PC, over WiFi. It can wirelessly stream from an iPad or iPhone.</i><p>AirSync by doubleTwist [7] can do that as well, works with Mac and PC. If you just want iTunes support directly, there is the iTunes Remote [8] which can control the music on your computer or stream it to your Android device with AirBubble [9]. There's also Twonky [10] and tons of other such apps to choose from.<p><i>It can wirelessly stream from an iPad or iPhone. It can even show an iOS game on your TV, turning your iPhone or iPad into a controller and your TV into a game console.</i><p>This kinda overlaps with the last point, but a couple more apps that I think get close to this include Plex [11] and Skifta [12].<p><i>I don't see how an Android dongle will allow you to do any of that.</i><p>It brings Android to your TV. So replace ""your Android device"" with ""your TV"" in the above examples.<p>[1] <a href=""http://market.android.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://market.android.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b?ie=UTF8&node=2350149011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b?ie=UTF8&node=2350149...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://market.android.com/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclien...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://market.android.com/details?id=com.hulu.plus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/details?id=com.hulu.plus</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/ontv/devices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/ontv/devices</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-apps-for-streaming-tv-movies-12188/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-apps-for-stream...</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://market.android.com/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayerProKey"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androi...</a><p>[8] <a href=""https://market.android.com/details?id=hyperfine.hftunes.release"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/details?id=hyperfine.hftunes.rele...</a><p>[9] <a href=""https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bubblesoft.android.airbubble"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bubblesoft.android...</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/twonky-wireless-media-streaming-from-android-to-tv-pc-dlna-devices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/twonky-wireless-media-st...</a><p>[11] <a href=""https://market.android.com/details?id=com.plexapp.gtv"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/details?id=com.plexapp.gtv</a><p>[12] <a href=""https://market.android.com/details?id=com.skifta.android.app"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/details?id=com.skifta.android.app</a>",1326053137

But Hurl can be used to execute malicious statements.<p>It is a difference, whether an attacker uses his own IP address (or a setup with various VPNs and proxies) or uses Hurl for it so that the target website sees only Hurl's IP in its logs.<p>In times of free WiFi, the traceability of malicious requests is definitely reduced anyway, but Hurl could potentially add another layer that can be used by an attacker to obscure his/her origin.

When Mitt Romney said, ""Corporations are people too"" at the Iowa State Fair he wasn't sharing his own personal beliefs. Instead he was telling the truth. See Corporate Personhood[1] for more.<p>From this it follows that Corporations have the right to free speech. This is where the supreme court ruled[2] that it is unconstitutional to deny corporations the right to political speech.<p>The legal requirements are disclosures and that's why you hear ""paid for by Americans for a better tomorrow"" or something like that. Corporations don't directly give to campaign coffers, but through a series of transactions often via PACs (political action committees) it eventually gets to where it's going. It is illegal for PAC's to coordinate with the campaign, but this does happen in subtle and less than subtle ways.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood</a>

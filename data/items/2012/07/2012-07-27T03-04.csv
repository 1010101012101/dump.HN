As soon as you dive into specific issues, such predicting what will happen with China, virtual reality, space exploration etc, you'll have a much better chance of success if you predict status quo, or nothing at all. You hit on something though. We won't have ""real"" AI in 2037, but believe we're in the midst of a machine learning and computer vision revolution. Self driving cars should be possible in 25 years, technically. Whether there will be legal issues or not I can't guess.",1343361509

4299949,comment,4298234,4298234,2,0,raja,,,"I'd love to hear commentary from Twitter or Instagram on the rationale for this. I don't think it's very plausible that this is due to 'strain' on Twitter's infrastructure as the Techcrunch article alludes. If API call volume was really the cause for Twitter blocking the API call, I'm sure Instagram would have been happy to throttle the volume of such API calls by limiting the amount of Twitter friend searches over a period of time (ex: you can only find new friends once/week).<p>It all seems very counterintuitive and you think that Twitter would be encouraging content creation and engagement on their platform as it creates defensibility for the service. Consider this: Twitter probably is positioned to spot emerging trends faster than any other service by being able to mine emergent links, etc.<p>I think this is going to leave a myriad of mainstream users disenchanted by Twitter locking them out of their friends list.<p>I signed up to Twitter very early (user id ~5000) and have been enamoured by it's growth and how it's established itself as the preeminent destination for open conversation and realtime search/discovery. There are a lot of smart people at the helm of Twitter and I have faith that they'll realize their mistake and fix it. Otherwise the conversation will go elsewhere and it would be a shame to see all that value dissipate.<p>Thoughts? Keep the conversation going on Twitter: @raja",1343361355

4299922,comment,4296956,4296956,15,0,Cogito,,,"Bit of history for those who might not know the back story.<p>Mods for Minecraft have been around almost as long as Minecraft has been. These mods took the form of patches to the decompiled .jar archives that the client and server code was distributed as.<p>It quickly became clear that different mods would often patch the same files, usually in contradictory ways, so applying different mods at the same time was near impossible.<p>Two projects sprang up to make the modder's life easier: hMod by hey0 [1] and the Minecraft Coders Pack (MCP) [2].<p>MCP was an attempt to translate decompiled obfuscated java code into something 'meaningful' that could be used to more easily write mods. Some of the people who would later go on to work on Bukkit were involved in this project. MCP also played a large role in keeping mods up to date as new versions were released.<p>Hey0's mod 'hmod' was the first successful server mod that provided an abstracted 'API' for developing plugins against. The community loved this idea, and an ecosystem of plugins sprung up extremely quickly around it. Server administrators were now able to install many different plugins, each of which would (almost certainly) work with each other at the same time.<p>Unfortunately, hey0 lost interest in the project, and the group that had started to maintain it felt they were often working against the code base, rather than with it. Hey0 was a relatively new programmer when he started the project (I think he was 14?) and while a lot was achieved there were a few architectural aspects that were extremely hard to change.<p>For better or worse (probably better in retrospect) the team that had started to maintain hmod broke off to a new project called Bukkit [3]. The four main team members at that point were EvilSeph, Dinnerbone, Grum and Tahg. This is the 'core' Bukkit team that was hired by Mojang a little while ago to work on Minecraft (and probably other things) full time.<p>I had started developing on hmod a few months before Bukkit started, and switched to it soon after. I eventually became one of the main contributors to that project, and still get involved from time to time.<p>Bukkit as a project aimed to learn from hmod, incorporating much of what was learnt from the mistakes in the original design. The project was still very young, and there was a lot of pressure on the project from the community. The pressure was primarily a result of hmod dying once the team that was supporting it moved on.<p>Every time a new Minecraft version was released, the server mods had to be updated. The new clients wouldn't work with an old server version, and there was no easy way to downgrade a client, so server administrators would have many angry users who could not connect to their modded server. The upgrade process was by far the most troublesome for a modding project, and was what the MCP project was most helpful in assisting with.<p>The source code would need to be decompiled, and then deobfuscated. Any changes by the mod would then need to be re-applied to the newly deobfuscated source, before repackaging everything for the server admins to install. One of the biggest problems with hmod was how incredibly hard and slow this process was. It would often take days if not weeks for this upgrade process to complete. When the team left hmod no one was left to rebuild it every time there was a new release, and so hmod died. It took a long time before anyone was able to revive that project [4]. Bukkit was designed first around making this process as easy as possible, and the results showed. A number of updates took less than a few hours from the time a new version was released by Mojang.<p>That being said, Bukkit had many issues. One that I was constantly working with was the number of classes implemented in the 'API' section of the code. We used two projects, Bukkit and CraftBukkit, to separate the plugins from the source code. Bukkit was what plugins linked against, and provided a stableish API that wouldn't break (too often). CraftBukkit implemented all the necessary hooks and behaviours in the server itself. Unfortunately, some classes were built into the API that made things quite difficult. We were locked into certain material behaviours, for example, because of the way they were implemented. Interestingly, one of the 'Coding standards' for the new API addresses this directly<p><i>Absolutely no already-implemented classes. Use interfaces, and have util classes created by a implementation-controlled Factory.</i><p>So I see it this way:
Bukkit was created 'from fresh' to address some extremely difficult problems that made maintaining the existing solution (hmod) extremely time consuming and troublesome. As Bukkit matured it was able to deal with lots of issues, but some kept re-occurring. Integrating with client-side mods was a common problem that had no easy solution in the way Bukkit worked, for example. When the opportunity to create a supported, integrated plugin system presented itself, experience said that starting fresh was going to be the easiest way.<p>Something that might not be clear is that the actual Minecraft source code is (apparently - I have never seen it myself) very different to the decompiled and de-obfuscated version that CraftBukkit built on. To take advantage of being able to change the original source code much of what CraftBukkit does would need to be rewritten. Changing the API side of things (Bukkit) at the same time frees them to make better choices and learn from mistakes.<p>We will surely find out if that turns out to be the case, but for now I am quite excited to see what happens.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ohloh.net/p/hmod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ohloh.net/p/hmod</a> - there is probably a better resource, but I can't find it<p>[2] <a href=""http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/Main_Page</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://bukkit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bukkit.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.canarymod.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canarymod.net/</a><p>EDIT: grammar and such",1343360711

It was limited to one frame on the stack and could only return values.  Recent enhancements have allowed values to be passed back into the suspended function.  That's still not a full co-routine though since Python only lets you go one level down on the stack.<p>As someone else mentioned, you need to get deeper into programming languages, not operating systems.  Scheme has call/cc which can be used to build co-routines.  Someone needs to clue in the nodejs crazies as well, callbacks are not the way to design a language. ;-)",1343359816

4299886,comment,4298416,4298914,2,0,wutbrodo,,,"The way that valuation of a company works is that the multiple of market cap over annual revenue is supposed to reflect (mainly) expectations of growth.  This multiple for Google is less than Facebook's by a LOT, because Google, as a relatively mature company working off of a larger revenue base, is expected to grow more slowly percentage-wise, all else held equal (this has been borne out by the vast majority of companies, and is pretty much common sense, as doubling sales is a lot harder to do when one is already doing tens of billions of dollars in sales).
The fact that Facebook is growing more slowly than a company with much lower expectations of growth instead of living up to its expectations of hypergrowth (as implied by the valuation) is a signal that the current growth expectations (as implied by the valuation) are too high (hence the ""all else held equal"" part of the last paragraph:  if a company isn't performing as well as it should, then it's of course possible that it'll grow more slowly than a larger competitor with lower expectations of growth).  This of course ignores the possibility that FB comes up with an amazing revenue-boosting innovation like AdWords and begins to fulfill their expected growth rate.
Things like ""search advertising has different dynamics to [sic] social advertising"" can't just be completely removed from consideration.  They're precisely what determine if Facebook is inaccurately valued or if the huge growth expected from it will occur/continue.",1343359531

our knowledge and capacity, and human nature that debases and waste them.<p>Existential threats to mankind will still occasionally surface. The threat of

Line-level employees want praise from coworkers and bosses.  Executives want praise from their peers, investors, industry, and press.  Concepts like ethics, ""right,"" or even this-is-good-for-thie-world isn't a concern when faced with ""X will increase my social status and happiness with my peer brogrammers.""  What's X?  It's anything possible, regardless of legal, right, wrong, or ethical.<p>A nontrivial number of companies use unethical methods (spam, false invites, false installs, phone and email address book capture, fake attractive profiles) to increase their vanity metrics.  Employees see those methods as either: ""this is bad, but it's <i>sooooo</i> good for us look at all the lame n00bs who fall for our tricks"" or ""this is bad, and I'm ashamed to work here.""<p>The ones who feel shame would take the Hippogrammer Oath.  Those who revel in manipulating others and standing on their broken bodies will rake in all the profits while the good guys just sit around and ""play nice.""<p>Even the tech darlings of today used spammy methods to grow their initial user base.  How do you grow your userbase to ten million when you're growing at a constant 5,000 per day?  Obviously you want to ""go viral.""  How does one just on a whim ""go viral?""

You're really going to use that logical fallacy to support the religion for which you are a true believer.<p>The delicious irony of your hatred is that your point is so poorly argued, you must be a wikipedia editor.<p>I'm actually a pretty accomplished wikipedia editor with several original article credits.

It's just a really low quality content farm that can't be trusted on anything.<p>What is the point of getting your knowledge from unreliable losers? All the biggest wikipedia editors are no-life losers with zero respect in any real intellectual community. They are divorced from the community of experts and receive nothing but scorn from them.<p>What's the point of reading an encyclopedia written by people who you can't rely on? Getting 80% of the content right is not an achievement--every content farm on the internet does the same--from eHow to expertsexchange.<p>Wikipedia is just an ideology and volunteer driven low quality content farm. Due to Wikipedia's overpowering marketing/SEO, when Wikipedia writes an article on a topic,  that Wikipedia article will now have higher visibility than the original information source that it scraped and now cites. The Wikipedia article will steal traffic from the original source.<p>The internet would be so much better without content farms. And Wikipedia is the worst of the worst.<p>When I feel like writing an encyclopedia article, I send it now to Encyclopedia Britannica.

There are quite a few repetitive processes that are quite tedious and time consuming. Keeping track of members seems to be a time consuming aspect of running the club, and I'd like to build a web app where officers can keep track of their members. A club will sign up for the site, and be able to login and add their members including their .edu email, major, and year. Ideally members would be able to pay their registration fee's through this site and become a member for the club so that they are automatically populated in the member list. Then members can check in to meetings and events through this site which will allow the chapters to track the members participation within the club.<p>They'll have an option to receive notifications. Officers will be able to create an event, and then the members will receive the information for that event automatically, the day of or the day before, whichever works best. ...I'm not sure about this feature though because this can already be done through facebook.<p>Do you think clubs would like to use something like this? If you think they would, do you think they would they be willing to pay a small fee for the service (I'm thinking about $5 a month or $50 a year, but I would have to reach out to clubs to see what they think is a reasonable amount)? I am also thinking about taking a small percentage of the club's membership fee as another source of revenue (maybe 5% per member that signs up through the site).<p>I plan on validating the idea by reaching out to all of the clubs at my university asking them about the idea and see if any of them will commit to the service before I build it.<p>Your feedback is greatly appreciated.",1367344042

You still have just as much accountability -- nothing can get into master without a developer looking at it and tagging it with a commit message. It's just that the commit message comes from a developer looking at and curating the work he just did on a feature or bugfix, instead of the vague assumptions and notions he was working with during development.<p>If you think people looking back on their recent work will be better at summarizing their motives and achievements than they were while working and experimenting, as I do, then rewriting local history makes a lot of sense. If you don't trust people, and think they are likely to lose relevant information by haphazardly rebasing with messages like ""squash for pushing to master, bug #1933"" then you might not.<p>All in all, I think that, for example, 2 clean messages from 2 developers (even relatively uninformative ones) are better to look at than 1 commit from one developer and 13 from the other with messages like ""first stab at xyz"" and ""Oops, forgot to also change the name here"".",1367343857

You had previously said:<p>>...But its endless divisibility seems to indicate that there is no such animal.<p>From where do you get this conclusion? Earlier, you described that the rod/cone balance in my eye is likely to be different than yours, and that this results in different qualia upon viewing the color red. That's variation -- not divisibility -- and I doubt that it's endless (lest we have infinitely many rods/cones).<p>'Qualia' is the name given to experience after everything else is stripped away. I view a sunset: I'm aware of it, I have certain emotional and physical reactions, memories are triggered, and so goes that functional account of my experience. Yet, we intuitively feel that there is something above and beyond those aspects of the experience.  Dennett wouldn't argue against our intuition for qualia, he'd just say that it's some combination of material/functional phenomenon.<p>His view is not radical: it conforms to the mainstream scientific account of our world.

If my feature takes two weeks to develop, when I'm ready to merge, I'm applying my changes to a codebase that's two weeks newer than when I branched. For a merge to be not-painful, the master branch should stay reasonably steady. This, I think, creates a conservative, change-adverse culture, rather than a IMO superior ""if it's wrong, fix it, fix it right and fix it now""-culture.<p>If I continuously rebase (and especially after a colleague emails saying he's pushed a big refactor), I can fix these things as and when they happen, and I can feed back to my colleague if something they've done works poorly with what I'm working on, and they can then address that while they still have the context of the rebase in working memory.<p>Finally, I think the history criticism is based on a too narrow view of history, as a single, linear reality. My code might have been weeks in the making, and while it's true I wrote that particular function on Monday, if I didn't push it until Thursday, it simply didn't exist in the world of my peers until then.

Say you decide, ""forget the whole vibration thing, we'll run the cryocooler half the time and take data half the time while the cooler is powered off""<p>Then you either get half the mission data, or extend the mission by a factor of two, which means twice the operational labor cost, plus every other part of the craft has to be double lifetime rated, which could get expensive.  Hubble used to burn thru gyros on a regular basis, so now you need them to last twice as long or launch with twice as many spares.  Or maneuvering propellant if any, now you need twice as much for station keeping.<p>You can easily get painted into a corner where the cheapest way to run a mission twice as long is to launch two of them.  At that point you're better off saying ""you know the cryocool half the time and take data half the time idea?  Yeah scrap that idea""<p>This is before we started on energy issues.  A heavy helium tank doesn't use much energy.  But cryocoolers on earth take quite a bit indeed, well, at least compared to a couple watt transmitter and all that.  Whats heavier, a tank big enough to last mission lifetime, or a cooler and a stunning array of solar panels to run the cooler?  Or since it only runs half the time as per above to prevent vibration issues, you could put a battery in which is heavy and becomes another exciting point of failure.  This makes the existing power system more complicated and less reliable possibly shortening the theoretical craft lifetime to less than you'd get if you just launched a big simple tank.",1367342310

Still though, there's a legitimate use case for asking for your contacts, and it is to help connect you with people you may know who are also on path. You also give them access to your photos to share things on Path, but there would be an uproar if they started uploading all of your photos to their servers. I'm not really seeing any good way to solve this at the OS level, it seems the only solution is for apps to be less shady.",1367341422

In the classmates.com example, they collected upwards of $75 million in revenue from this scheme, and only had to dish out $2.75 million for the settlement several years later. So for any newcomers, this type of bait is an attractive business proposition; the potential lawsuit years down the line can simply be attributed to cost of revenue. And you'll obviously only get sued if there's money to be won, which means the scheme was a success, so in other words, you want to get sued. The real problem is the judgments/settlements are an order of magnitude lower than they should be.",1367341362

Neither is SHA1,256,etc. The reason is that they are crypto hashes optimized for speed.<p>That's strange to hear you say that, because I remember people having huge arguments in the 1990s about how they couldn't use MD5 because it was /so/ slow and how 3DES was the only way to go!<p>I swear people love to re-write history.<p>> This is a clear example of ""Dont do your own crypto"" because you dont know all the details.<p>That doesn't even make any sense. MD5 is a standard cryptographic function. If someone had used it they wouldn't be making their own crypto.<p>Hell, many of the standard libraries implemented MD5 when you asked them to protect a password by default. That's so far from rolling your own it isn't even logical to try and make the argument you're making.<p>Your entire post reads like someone who knows nothing about the history and is just spouting ""OMG USE bcrypt IT IS THE BESTEST AND WILL BE SECURE FOREVER!""<p>bcrypt too will fall from grace and then you'll have someone making a post like yours saying ""how could anyone use bcrypt, it is SOOO fast!""",1367341339

Path was fined, not for anything involving address books, but for allowing 12 year olds to sign up for the service.<p>2. Yes... it is proof that Path uploads your phone book. Of course, they ask you. The OS won't even give you access to the phone book without prompting the user. So somewhere along the way, the user knowingly gave Path access to their contacts.<p>It would be rather trivial for a real reporter to do some research here. Does Path actually say ""We're going to invite all your friends via SMS"", even in fine print? It might be sleazy, but it would certainly change a lot. But instead, we're just going to sit here and speculate about things and irrationally talk about a fine that didn't have anything to do with this.",1367341244

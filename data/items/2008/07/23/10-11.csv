254223,comment,363,363,0,0,13ren,,,"a reddit-style toolbar (ie. so you can easily comment/vote <i>after</i> reading).<p>Is there a way to do this already?<p><i>EDIT</i> I just read that some use the bookmarklet for this: apparently, when you submit a site that has already been submitted, it takes you to the comments on it. Actually, that method is more general, because it also works for article you found in non-hackernews ways. Thus, the hackernews comments become <i>annotations</i> of the article.<p>However, the bookmarklet requires that you submit the article. This is bad because (1) it's an extra click (2) it will submit the article, in the case where it has not been submitted already. I guess that second point is not so bad, but it would be nice to have a <i>goto annotation</i> bookmarklet, which went directly to the comments. I hereby request this as a feature.<p>This requires an operator like:<p><pre><code>  http://new.ycombinator.com/gotolink?u=[someURL]\n</code></pre>\nthat does a lookup to find the URL's id, and builds the following with it:<p><pre><code>  http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=[URL's id]\n</code></pre>\n(i.e. the code that is already present in the submitlink operator.  It just needs to be exposed as an operator in its own right).<p>And an <i>annotation bookmarklet</i> like:<p><pre><code>  javascript:window.location=%22http://news.ycombinator.com/gotolink?u=%22+encodeURIComponent(document.location)+%22\n</code></pre>\n<i>shamelessly editing Phil Kast's bookmarklet</i>",1216809340

254212,comment,253918,253918,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I think that the number one legal issue that new startups/founders run into is partnership issues - how to structure your company, what's in the Buy/Sell, how to dissolve, how to create cliffs, how vesting works. These are issues all small startups face and they are generic enough to  draw a big audience. Best of luck!",1216807939

254208,comment,254191,254191,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I went through similar pains getting the data off of my Amiga systems before I sold them when moving to the valley (I'd long since gotten rid of all of my C64 stuff, so not quite as ancient).  It's surprisingly complicated when all of the ""usual"" methods (USB memory key, CD/DVD ROM, network) are unavailable.  Even though the Amiga could write to a 720K DOS format floppy, I no longer have any machines that have a floppy drive, and I had several things to move that were too big, anyway, and would have had to be split via whatever archiving program I used on the Amigas (lzh, maybe?) which I didn't remember how to do.  I used to connect to the Internet via modem on the Amiga, which might have worked, but I no longer have a phone line to hook it up to or dial up internet service.<p>Ended up going the serial route, and <i>still</i> had to dig an old PC out of the closet because my current PCs don't have them.  But, I finally did get all of my MODs off of the machines.  Took about a week from deciding I was going to do it to getting the cable and software working.<p>And, ""The Lives of Others"" <i>is</i> a fantastic film.",1216807507

Make that open-source, and then it just starts bleeding out. Auto-upload that to an app where people could get speech-to-text transcription / notifications / annotate sections / review past laws being read by past congress-people / etc.  From there, ensure all bills can be edited in a central and private repositories (probs git, erryone likes git, though svn treats me well), so that all final bills can have all individual contributions clearly marked/annotated automatically.

As long as most people can download data significantly faster than upload them, data hosted in the cloud has advantages. Ideally eventually internet connections would become symmetric and fast enough for everyone to have their own low power server with a static ipv6 address at home, with which they can sync all their data. Of course this does not solve the problem that most sever software has complicated configuration and open source alternatives often lack the polish of commercial products. But as soon as there is a switch to ipv6 and symmetric internet access, I see little reason why a decentralized solution would not win.",1405688220

Investors are the owners of the bank, they don&#x27;t &quot;put pressure&quot;, they manage their property. Investors will want their property to grow and issue dividends as much as possible - investment bank or not. Calling it a deposit bank isn&#x27;t going to change that.<p>The risk profile of investors is also not a consideration. More risk aggressive investors can simply leverage themselves. Investors want the risk level that&#x27;s appropriate for the business. They may disagree on what that level is, but that disagreement will stem from different strategic outlooks and not from personal preferences.<p>An again: so ibanks cannot fund investments from deposits? That becomes entirely irrelevant the minute you have a liquid commercial paper market. Instead of investing deposits, the ibank will simply borrow money short term from a bank that has deposits. This is what happened in practice. It even happened with companies like GE which became de faco ibanks thanks to their high credit rating.<p>And yes, this means the deposit bank will be exposed to the risks the ibank is taking. If you want to regulate that out, you&#x27;ll have to require banks be entirely in cash or treasuries. Glass-Steagall won&#x27;t do.",1405688019

8052585,comment,8048997,8051453,1,0,msandford,,,"I guess what I&#x27;m trying to do is understand the rationale behind your argument of &quot;sender pays&quot; and who is &quot;consuming bandwidth&quot; because it&#x27;s not clear to me how things should be measured.<p>I will sketch out my argument as follows:<p>1.  Data transfer requires mutual consent or else it either a) doesn&#x27;t happen or b) is considered a network attack<p>2.  On the internet today the majority of transfer flows are asymmetric; regular users download more than they upload.  I don&#x27;t know if this is the natural way of the universe or it happens this way because of the way residential broadband is structured i.e. more download capability than upload<p>3.  People who have more outflow than inflow pay to be connected to the internet (i.e. servers)<p>4.  People who have more inflow than outflow pay to be connected to the internet (i.e. regular users)<p>5.  Somewhere this traffic has to meet in the middle and transition from a network where the sender is paying to the network where the receiver is paying<p>6.  This is typically called a peering point and the transit here is usually settlement-free not because it&#x27;s usually balanced (though in many cases it is) but because it&#x27;s the point at which the sender-pays network meets up with the receiver-pays network.  In other words the sender pays for the network transit from their servers all the way up to the peering point and the receiver pays for the network transit from the peering point onwards to their house.<p>7.  When looking at the problem this way it&#x27;s hard for me to determine who is &quot;using&quot; more network bandwidth because again, data is only transferred by the consent of parties on both the sender-pays and receiver-pays network<p>I understand the argument that Verizon is a Tier 1 ISP and thus deserves to be paid for transit.  The Tier 1 ISP is actually Verizon Business a largely separate division of Verizon from Verizon Residential.  But Level 3 is also a Tier 1 ISP and thus by that logic also deserves to be paid for transit.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network#List_of_tier_1_networks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network#List_of_tier_1_n...</a><p>I also understand the argument that &quot;all peering needs to be roughly equal or else someone needs to pay&quot; but again when company A has customers who send more than they receive and company B has customers who receive more than they send I can&#x27;t understand why A and B don&#x27;t agree to let the ratios move away from balanced.  I understand historically the ratios were close to even but when they&#x27;re both selling asymmetric service to their customers why insist on symmetric peering?<p>EDIT:<p>From Wikipedia &quot;peering&quot; is sometimes called &quot;sender keeps&quot;<p>&quot;In computer networking, peering is a voluntary interconnection of administratively separate Internet networks for the purpose of exchanging traffic between the users of each network. The pure definition of peering is settlement-free, &quot;bill-and-keep,&quot; or &quot;sender keeps all,&quot; meaning that neither party pays the other in association with the exchange of traffic; instead, each derives and retains revenue from its own customers.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering</a>",1405685757

8052575,comment,8049180,8051159,1,0,saurik,,,"I described in my comment how the comment by tptacek is not correct; I can state again: it &quot;corrects&quot; klodolph&#x27;s comment, and yet klodolph&#x27;s comment was correct and did not deserve correction. tptacek tries to use this comment as an example, turning to the side to address the audience to voice this correction towards everyone with the &quot;not really focussed on you&quot; hedge, but uses the &quot;not <i>too loose</i>&quot; quoting to make it clear that klodolph is still the example.<p>This particular way in which tptacek&#x27;s comment is &quot;mistaken&quot; is related to the tone and attitude tptacek takes in his comments. If this were the only instance, even the only instance for this particular topic, it would be one thing, but this is a common issue with tptacek&#x27;s comments. The pattern is that there are certain &quot;common misconceptions&quot; that everyone has, and tptacek is not generous to the poster of any specific comment that they might not possess them.<p>I further believe that it is a serious problem on Hacker News that people do not address these kinds of tone issues: that it is perfectly fine to &quot;HEADDESK&quot;, claim that certain beliefs are &quot;virulent&quot;, and to even use the word &quot;nonsensical&quot; to describe someone&#x27;s idea, and yet attempts to point out issues in the tone of peoples&#x27; comments is somehow a problem: something where you feel the need to say &quot;don&#x27;t make this conversation personal&quot;. More people need to stand up to this.<p>I, myself, have done some of these things in my own comments. I feel like most of these cases were situations where I was responding to someone else doing it to me, but I&#x27;ve found at least a few instances where that is not the case. It makes me very unhappy that I contributed to this problem: someone should have also complained about my tone in those instances. It needs to be ok to exit the topic and address how someone is saying something, not just what was said.<p>To be clear, tptacek&#x27;s position is correct: we don&#x27;t need a new interface; klodolph&#x27;s argument largely ends up arguing for fixing /dev/urandom. However, tptacek doesn&#x27;t say this, as he has assumed that klodolph doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between /dev/urandom and /dev/random, and then argued based on that assumption. If you read the other comments from klodolph, it is very very clear that he understands perfectly. tptacek could at least apologize.",1405685623

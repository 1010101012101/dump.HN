In other words, the assumption is that if x is not a violation of someone&#x27;s expectation of privacy, and doing y is not a violation of someone&#x27;s expectation of privacy, then doing both x and y is also not a violation of someone&#x27;s expectation of privacy.<p>However, the &#x27;mosaic theory&#x27; suggests that the above assumption is not valid - doing x and y individually might be perfectly reasonable, but doing both could be a violation of someone&#x27;s expectation of privacy.",1385197024

There are so many places in the world that neither have internet nor computers, how should they use bitcoins? I&#x27;m also convinced that those people will not just &quot;believe&quot; in some &quot;invisible&quot; money.

6785732,comment,6780878,6785066,1,0,pfisch,,,"Ok, this was a weird segue.  I thought we were talking about market capitalization and whether or not people use it outside of bitcoins, which they all do for basically everything.<p>However, non-voting common stock equities that do not grant dividends basically have no &quot;intrinsic value&quot; either I guess.  It is just a proxy for the public opinion of the net worth of the underlying asset, similar to bitcoins.<p>I think this kind of &quot;intrinsic value&quot; line of reasoning isn&#x27;t a very strong argument in general though because mostly the value of commodities is essentially based on the value people assign it via free market and psychological principles.<p>You sort of don&#x27;t seem like you know much about econ/finance so I think it is strange that you are so outspoken about bitcoins.<p>BTC could still collapse, and it very well may.  Even if we put the potential innovative benefits of btc aside though, things like this are more like cults vs religions.  A cult is a cult until it has enough followers at which point it becomes a religion.<p>Cults and religions have a similar scam potential which is what it seems like you are feeling, however at this point I would say btc is reaching or possibly above Scientology levels of belief/followers.  In fact the market cap of btc is possibly more than the market cap of Scientology right now.  If btc is going to fall apart as a pyramid scheme it will likely be the largest to ever fall.<p>However btc is more than a pyramid scheme because it does offer some real benefits over the existing financial systems.  The online blackmarket does require a currency similar to btc to operate.  Right now sending money across borders is difficult and expensive.  Right now buying things over the internet basically must be done with credit cards which has a lot of fees attached.  Right now there is no real way to quickly send large sums of money to people without similar fees and specific hours of operation.  You also have to go to a bank and deal with a lot of bullshit.<p>Whether btc will be the solution to these problems I am not sure, but it is a very big deal that it already has so many users/followers.  That is the hardest part of changing things, getting large scale adoption.",1385196740

Even if it happen, it seems just a huge step backward.<p>For portability, I don&#x27;t think JS is portable. Because  portability doesn&#x27;t come from a language. It comes from implementations by platform vendors. It&#x27;s purely up to how platform vendors support the compatible language and feature set implementation. JS itself has nothing special in portability. Though all the browser vendors are supporting JS, it doesn&#x27;t mean native platform vendors are interested in JS.<p>For the real serious portability, I think the only choice are C/C++ which are the CURRENTLY AVAILABLE de facto portability layer on ANY platform while keeping most of the benefits I mentioned.  Including mobiles, desktops, servers, game consoles, embedded devices and even on web-browsers. And also for any new unknown future platforms. C/C++ support is virtually promised due to its superior range of existing portability.<p>And intermixing them with Objective-C is literally natural, and far easier then JS.",1385196638

They just can&#x27;t imagine giving that up.<p>For me to trust the US government or to <i>truly</i> trust any US company again, these things would need to happen first, for US to re-establish its credibility in the world as a beacon of democracy and freedoms, that they&#x27;ve been pretending to uphold for a long time:<p>- pass Rush Holt&#x27;s Surveillance State Repeal Act passes, to dump the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act altogether (as a first step)<p>H.R 2818: <a href=\"http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/2818\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/2818</a><p>- cut NSA&#x27;s budgets (both secret and public) to 10-20 percent of what they are now, because if they aren&#x27;t, then simply repealing the laws won&#x27;t change much<p>- throw out the secret FISA Court, or make it dramatically more transparent, and like a real Court<p>- overhaul the Senate Intelligence Committee (get rid of people like Feinstein and Rogers)<p>- fire (or even imprison) Clapper, Alexander and Holder, and possibly even impeach Obama (to really send a message to future presidents that mass surveillance is completely unacceptable)<p>- make it explicitly clear that any private communication of any citizen in US or <i>on US territory</i> needs a <i>regular warrant</i> (one that actually respects the 4th Amendment). Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I thought the US Constitution applied to people on <i>US soil</i> and not just &quot;US citizens&quot;. Couldn&#x27;t that be interpreted to defend the data on US soil, too? If I buy a home in US, isn&#x27;t it defended by US laws? Why can&#x27;t my data be, too?<p>For non-US citizens, there also needs to be an international treaty that says that if a country wants another country&#x27;s citizen&#x27;s data, then it needs to contact his/her local government, before it can obtain.<p>I think it&#x27;s only reasonable. Just because my data happens to travel through US backbones, doesn&#x27;t mean the US government has power to willy-nilly get my data as they want, and also force US companies to give it to them, breaching the privacy that US company <i>promised me</i> when I signed-up with them.<p>Something like this is only possible right now, because like with all rights, people <i>haven&#x27;t fought against it</i> yet. There&#x27;s no reason why such a treaty couldn&#x27;t exist. For the Internet to become a nice, non-hostile environment again (talking about governments abusing their power here), we need to make it <i>encrypted and secure by default</i>, but we also need the legal framework to support that, and severely limit and punish government abuses.",1385196544

If you have a nice test framework with good coverage and automated build tests running stuff by valgrind, you mitigate the risk of having memory leaks.<p>Is it worth all the extra effort, when you could just go with a language that does GC at runtime? Sometimes it is, it depends on the use case and it depends on the people.<p>I&#x27;ve done a project rewrite from C to Java where the Java implementation performed a lot better and consumed less memory than the C one. Some of the performance gain was because I chose better algorithms and limited DB interaction, but some of the gain came from having immutability guarantees whereas the C code would just copy a lot of data structures where immutability was not guaranteed. A lot of time in the C based project was spent doing mallocs and frees and memcpys for nothing. This is poor project design, but poor design happens and Java has some protection agains that due to promoting encapsulation to a greater extent than C by default.<p>I am 100% certain that if the original project would&#x27;ve been better designed and managed, it would&#x27;ve kicked ass because having it in C would have allowed us to have a smaller memory footprint which would&#x27;ve meant a greater monetary profit in the end for this particular project over time due to system constraints.<p>What it comes down to is that if you have a good team that understands the required dev proccess of a mid-sized C project and who are profficient enough to implement such a project without doing too much &quot;quick fixin&#x27;&quot; it can be worth it. If you&#x27;re limited by the size and/or competence (everyone can&#x27;t be a rockstar.

Future volatility is expected to decrease, as the size and depth of the market grows.<p>> In the meantime, many merchants simply regularly pull the latest market rates from the exchanges and automatically update the prices on their websites.

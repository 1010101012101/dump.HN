I know we don't give enough feedback on our site right now, and many times it isn't noticeable enough.<p>Then number 6 happens almost every time I call on any of my accounts and it is really annoying. Over the phone punch in your whole account number and phone number, then the second you have a representative they immediately ask for your phone number and account number... Which I just gave the system 30 seconds ago. That has annoyed me for years.<p>I don't think all of these are huge problems all the time, but some reasonable good points are made.",1203530034

I'm a vi guy myself, but all the other, more _visually_ oriented developers in the office don't read code from top to bottom.  They scan the methods in the structure tab on eclipse.

119808,comment,119676,119797,0,0,DaniFong,,,"A friend once remarked to me that one of his 'cures for procrastination' is to do something only mildly distracting, and mildly amusing, after sitting down to work and both taking on any big problems. He says it takes some time to get settled, but he needs to feel a sort of mental presence of a problem before he can really tackle it.<p>Perhaps the right type of break is the same way: perhaps it lets you cool it and evaluate your issues before tackling them, instead of following the path of least resistance.",1203528413

It's my mistake for not being more clear about this, but I also feel it's less harmful to go out than to visit here. At least going out constitutes a concrete block of time, leaving you with a big block of time to get work done when you get back. On the other hand, many small visits to this site only serve as interruptions to your flow, never allowing you to have a big block of time for work.",1203527858

I'm taking statistics class right now and I really wish I was 1% as excited as he is about the subject.<p>I can really see how statistics are an awesome way to visualise important stuff to people, but when I'm sitting there trying to calculate the the t-value in a question on the average amount of mineral water in a bottle, it's hard not to find it boring.<p>How do you guys do to connect boring stuff like Stats with the bigger picture?<p>Edit: I also find his accent extremely funny :-)",1237200874

517973,comment,517933,517933,0,0,joshsharp,,,"I'm on the mailing list for the development of Reia and I've been watching progress with some interest. There's already a web framework being built (Ryan) so once the language becomes fully usable I think this'll be a very interesting language.<p>The one thing that worries me is how much Erlang will still be required. Reia is turning out to have a very Ruby-like syntax, so it should be easy to pick up, but having to learn Erlang as well would give me second thoughts.",1237199705
517972,comment,517687,517687,0,0,smanek,,,"I think the big problem with rendering LaTeX client side is that everyone uses different style files, fonts, etc. The options are to either include them all on the page (which would make it difficult for me to upload a LaTeX file, since I'd have to include half a dozen auxiliary resources). It seems like this problem has been solved adequately well by just having a PDF file (which embeds fonts, and doesn't need style files).<p>Even if browsers could render LaTeX clientside, I still feel like there would be no real advantage to PDF. Since there is no standard way to embed LaTeX markup in HTML, you would just have to link to a .tex file which the browser could display as a separate page, just like it displays a PDF.<p>I almost feel like XHTML would be a good fit for this problem. We could develop a XML schema for which a simple bijection to LaTeX markup exists. Then, since XHTML supports using multiple namespaces in a single document, we could include any LaTeX markup natively within an XHTML web page (by prefacing LaTeX markup elements with the proper namespace). You would still have to deal with fonts/styles, but I think that's a much easier problem in this sort of a framework.",1237199605

Wasted by means of mechanical/electric friction.

I would say that in most cases this doesn't even matter, everyone in my social network, and nearly every new person I meet, is on Facebook, I admit there's obviously a bias there i.e. the demographic of Facebook members probably matches that of my 'real-life' social network.",1237199276
517966,comment,517053,517737,0,0,fh,,,"> Which means married Anglican priests who convert to Catholicism (slightly more complicated -- you need the bishop to sign off on it) are now married Catholic priests.<p>If you are correct, then by the same trick a woman can become a Catholic priests, but I don't think the rules of theology are quite as literal as that. While I don't doubt that such a person is married, and Catholic, and a priest, I doubt that he would be considered a Catholic priest. Either that, or God itself is trapped in a logical paradox and the universe explodes.",1237199272

If the application itself could be built around the open data standards, without obviously spending a lot of time on things that provide no immediate value, it would be much easier to justify.<p>My boss/client is not going to pay me to add REST interfaces and metadata that has only vague hypothetical future usefulness <i>but</i> he might pay me to build the data layer for the application in a way that just happens to also be somewhat open, especially if doing so makes the application better or easier to build.<p>To meet that requirement, the universal ontology stuff might have to be sacrificed but just having API access to more web apps, even if they are all proprietary, would be a worthwhile compromise.<p>Based on the video alone, I thought that was what TBL was proposing but I see from the links that he's still pushing the whole RDF rigamarole. That might catch on among a few large informational projects but the web at large is either going to ignore it or make a mess out of it.",1237199240

Is that common?<p>I have been coding for years with multiple editor windows open in various forms - browsers in Smalltalk, multiple windows in Xcode, Eclipse, etc. If you use multiple windows, you can always fit 2 (or even more) windows side by side on a widescreen. I definitely prefer a wider than a taller screen.",1237199131

517954,comment,517301,517555,0,0,smanek,,,"Yep, it isn't a new idea. The premise of Von Neumann machines is that you work around the cpu/data bottleneck with increasingly faster (and larger) caches. You have a tiny bit of ludicrously fast on chip memory (registers), a few megs of successively larger and slower L1/L2/L3 cache, a few gigs of kind of slow memory, and hundreds of gigs of unbelievably slow hard disk. This would just split the unbelievably slow disk into two separate layers - kind of slow SSD and really slow disk.",1237198123

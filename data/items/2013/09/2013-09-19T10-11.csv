If you would want to produce a game for the SNES, to actually distribute it you would have to put it on a cartridge and sell it.<p>But the design and specifications of these cartridges was protected by Nintendo, so the only way to distribute a game was to ask Nintendo for cartridges. Because Nintendo would only allow quality games on its shelves, it would test your game before allowing you any cartridges, so your game basically had to be nearly finished before you could ask Nintendo for cartridges. Of course if you were refused at this point you would have already invested tons of money so it would be pretty ruinous.<p>Besides the go/no-go signal, Nintendo also controlled the _amount_ of cartridges you would get. If Nintendo decided (much like Apple did in recent years) that your game was more valuable if it had limited copies, then you wouldn&#x27;t get many copies, regardless if that would leave you with not enough revenue to make a profit.<p>Reasons for refusal of cartridges were both fair and rather unfair. For example you could be refused for lack of quality, but you could also be refused because another game in your genre already had shelve space and they didn&#x27;t want to endanger its dominance. Basically you were at the complete mercy of how Nintendo wanted to make maximum profit for it self.<p>I have heard, though I don&#x27;t know for sure (maybe someone could check it :P) that Atari eventually went bankrupt because it decided to make a Nintendo game (as a last resort perhaps), got into a conflict with Nintendo, sued them, and lost..",1379587561

- you get the encapsulation/isolation out of the box

  // (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) the shift vector (x1-x2,y1-y2) (normalized by

Graphic design is the design of printed, or visual communications. Graphic from the Greek Graphos, for &quot;writing&quot;. That is, how the written communication <i>works</i>. To go from that to conclude that &quot;Oh graphic design is just how it looks then&quot; doesn&#x27;t make any sense, and demonstrates a very shallow understanding of what it actually involves.<p>Furthermore, with graphic design along with any design process- the most important thing you learn is the process. The process of research, iteration, prototyping, throwing out most of your ideas, starting again and again and refining, and learning- all towards the goal of solving a specific problem.<p>That is all design. Not just graphic design. To go from there to &quot;Oh but this guy can do some neat looking bevels in photoshop&quot;, it really just blows my mind, how amazingly dismissive and disrespectful such a view point is.<p>That Human-Computer interaction is &quot;new&quot; is really just way to hype it up. There is absolutely nothing new about the process of achieving a good HCI design, because it&#x27;s the same principles from graphic design, typography, and industrial design all over again, simply applied to this new medium. There is nothing special or unique about it, except that you can get a faster turnaround time on prototypes.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising that designers specialise, and all contribute to how it works. But it&#x27;s like a british tank. All the soldiers in the tank are trained to do each other&#x27;s jobs, so they can take over if required. They are all &quot;Designers&quot;.",1379585153

You could be supporting a product you like, hence increasing their chances of survival. You could be just buying something you don&#x27;t necessarily need to help the person selling it, putting someone else&#x27;s needs before yours, which generally feels good if done voluntarily. Finally, you&#x27;re reducing attachment to your wealth, which reduces the importance of your bank balance in your happiness. That kind of attachment reduction leads to more personal freedom.",1379585070

We do a lot of custom drawing as well (like I said, our app dates back to iOS 3, so we even have a messy custom transition animation layer that wouldn&#x27;t have been necessary with newer OSes) but it sounds like we&#x27;ve sidestepped some of the issues you&#x27;ve run into just by chance.<p>For instance, we already had custom text metrics code since our app&#x27;s font is italic, and that code already rounded to non-retina boundaries. And I think nearly all our tableviews already had custom backgroundViews.<p>Our biggest incompatibility was a progress HUD popup that subclassed UIAlertView, and that drawing broke completely in iOS 7 (it just turned into a little blurry white bar in the middle of the screen.",1379584856

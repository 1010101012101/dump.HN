There will be no new varieties coming out of natural cross pollination because we are left with sterile patented varieties.</i><p>That makes sense. But it only seems to apply to species that have <i>already</i> been thoroughly reshaped by humanity (pets, food and similar). Not what you normally think of when someone goes crying about biodiversity. To me it just seems like a more efficient/adapted successor generation to our <i>current</i> designed species.<p><i>Exactly. The viruses, bacteria and pests are evolving naturally; they are increasing their resistance to the existing pesticides.

5994474,comment,5993183,5993904,7,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think there&#x27;s an undercurrent that might be too difficult for Doug to have expressed openly. The thing that must be understood is the idea that &quot;The Demo&quot; was the culmination, the pinnacle, of years of hard work. Visionary work. Work that was not just hard on its own (imagine writing that software without the modern languages and tooling we have today, let alone trying to get it to run on such primitive devices) but which was also likely a very aggravating trial in terms of interactions with others and with the bureaucracies he had to face.<p>Unfortunately for Doug instead of &quot;The Demo&quot; being the end of such struggles and the opening of a door to the payoff for his work it was the beginning of an even larger struggle. Indeed, if anything it was even the preparation prior to that beginning. And the industry was not in the mood to listen at the time, generally speaking.<p>Sure he could have found other work, but most folks only have so much fruitless struggle in them, and he might have been at the end of his capacity, and sought instead a more comfortable and easy life, letting his legacy bear fruit on its own as it would or not.<p>It did bear fruit, of course, though it&#x27;s telling that even when a major Fortune 500 company, Xerox, attempted to build something revolutionary with a lot of inspiration from his work, the Alto, it still missed the mark, partly because the company was clueless and not very committed to the idea. And that was a mere 5 years later. It took several additional false starts and a decade of additional work for many of those ideas to actually become practical and commercially viable (in, for example, the Apple Macintosh).<p>It also required the inception and maturation of an entire new industry, not just the microcomputer industry but &quot;startup culture&quot; and the silicon valley way of doing business, to create the sort of environment where revolutionary ideas such as Doug&#x27;s could find willing listeners and folks willing to take such ideas to heart in the making of new types of computing systems.<p>In a not insignificant way Doug was responsible for the blooming of silicon valley and of startup culture itself even though his contributions came too early for him to receive an easy payoff. The irony, of course, is that today a &quot;demo&quot; similar to Doug&#x27;s in today&#x27;s world is often a quick route to substantial funding or even acquisition. There are lots of tech startups out there today who have far less substance, both in terms of functionality and man-hours, behind their business than went into &quot;The Demo&quot; and are swimming in tens of millions of dollars of VC funding.",1373025329

Obviously you don&#x27;t want to run voice over a (real) TCP stream, so I got that wrong.<p>I would argue however, that the &quot;feature&quot; of SIP to send the audio over an out-of-band channel has caused me so much misery over time that I wish it didn&#x27;t exist. I have managed a VOIP provider and at the edge we terminated SIP, terminated the audio on the incoming system, where it was sent to a central &quot;cluster&quot; for routing, and then terminated again on the outbound. Yes this &quot;wastes&quot; bandwidth, both on the (internal) network and memory/cpu bandwidth too. How much ? Well, about 3*48 kbit per call, on a 10Gbe network. And the machines were needed anyway : inbound customer lines termination needed 2 machines for redundancy. The routing &quot;cluster&quot; needed to be 2 machines so as to be separate from the inbounds (due to much more complicated configs), and again 2 for redundancy in different datacenters (and then 4, and 8 when customer base grew). And the upstream (towards providers) machines weren&#x27;t even machines, but routers. Again doubled for redundancy.<p>We didn&#x27;t actually run IAX (mostly because the routers didn&#x27;t support it), so I do not know much about it. We explicitly avoided using the out-of-band audio feature, and we knew why. It&#x27;s savings are negligeable, and there&#x27;s no end to the trouble it causes in operations.",1373024627

5994423,comment,5990864,5991619,5,0,waps,,,"There is still a massive difference between developers and sysadmins even in the devops era. You can make a caricature of both professions to point out the difference.<p>A sysadmin and a developer walk into a bar. They decide each to make a website doing order management and return in a month to demonstrate both solutions.<p>First the developer gets his turn. There&#x27;s a massive version history, which is shown. After 15 minutes of browsing through commit messages and pointing out test cases and &quot;look how easy it is&quot;, everyone in the cafe requests to be shown the actual site. After pointing out there&#x27;s more LoC dedicated to unit testing the code than there is actual code, the programmer gives in and opens a web browser. &quot;Could not connect to site&quot;. The programmer forgot to start his solution&#x27;s web server. He logs into a shell, gives the command. After 3 tries he gets the command right, and it won&#x27;t start. It is quickly noticed that there is a bug on the top of the main function preventing it from starting. He quickly fixes it. The website has every feature you could possibly want and more than a few you wouldn&#x27;t want, and looks beautiful, if a bit &quot;full&quot;. And every individual feature works beautifully and perfectly as designed, and then 2 or 3 features have to work together and an hourglass appears. After 5 minutes they give up the wait, and the programmer digs into the code and concludes that it was completely unreasonable for the sysadmin to ask for a demonstration of picking a product and while a mail notification service was enabled, something which was never in the requirements ! Getting a report out of the system takes the better part of the day. Before the demo can go further the web server crashes and not only did the programmer lose the entire order database, but the versioning system, including all the code, and surprisingly the crash also managed to take out the entire contents of the programmer&#x27;s gmail inbox, X-COM savegames and his drink is suddenly empty. Only the drink&#x27;s disappearance can reasonably be blamed on the sysadmin.<p>Second, the devops/sysadmin turn comes round. His website has been running for a long time, in fact he says he didn&#x27;t bother restarting it to add the last 10 features he added to the site. The programmer (and everyone who isn&#x27;t the sysadmin) has serious trouble distinguishing the website from a terminal window, or indeed, from an unpowered laptop. Tiny gray letters on a black background list the orders, as confirmed by an inspection of the sysadmins laptop screen with a magnifier glass and extreme brightness settings. They are preceeded with 10 letters that can be either small caps, or capitals illustrating the various properties an order might have. Oh and it can also be one of 2378 other letters that indicate various things, but even the sysadmin himself has forgotten most of them. There is one test, which starts up the system, and runs 1000 orders through them. The &quot;RoundFloat&quot; function in the code turns out to return a string, &quot;dog&quot;, but is never called. There is no reporting functionality, insists the programmer. The sysadmin disagrees. Look ! echo &#x27;cat orders/<i></i>/??d<i>.2013.</i>.xyzz2??3?? | sed &quot;<i>&(</i>)&^#@<i>\&^\\@#&quot; | grep | perl -pe &quot;lqwtq8</i>(&()lj;lkd&quot; | mail jef@boem.com&#x27; >> /etc/cron.daily adds daily reporting of all orders in the asian region over $220 to the system ! The sysadmin insists that this is simple, as he got it right the first time. When a person standing at the bar is asked to enter an order into the system, he tries for 10 minutes, then knifes the sysadmin in frustration, before retreating to an optician for damage control. The &quot;web server&quot;, which turns out to be a bash script, has never spent more than .0003 picoseconds serving the page. The page ? Yes, there is only one after all. Why would an order tracking system need more than one page ? It turns out the webpage page is text/raw, not text/html, after which a baffled sysadmin enquires what&#x27;s wrong with that. An inspection of the versioning system reveals 3 commit messages &quot;start&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;end&quot;, and nothing else. It&#x27;s replicated to 5 different datacenters, though. Look ! An offsite backup was initiated as soon as an order was entered. The programmer, still angry about his crashed server, takes an axe to the sysadmin&#x27;s laptop, which surprisingly remains operational after being hacked in 10 pieces, set on fire, and fed to a local dog. The sysadmin declares that he&#x27;s very proud of the system&#x27;s features, you know, both of them.<p>The whole thing ends in a barfight between the two, the sysadmin insisting that a non-working website has 0 features, even if the programmer implemented 3000 &quot;well-tested&quot; ones, chuckling at the &quot;tested&quot; word. The programmer was heard saying that a single black screen does not an order system make, before breaking a beer bottle and attacking, with help of the person that was asked to enter an order into &quot;the black hole&quot;.",1373024055

So even IF the CDU/CSU decided to move away from data retention in their election agenda, it would remain to be seen if this translated into actual laws. And since they didn&#x27;t even move away...",1373022970

When we test our gear, something like a 2 dB loss (out of 30 dB initial transmit power) anywhere within our operating range (-40 degrees to +85 degrees) would likely result in another board spin (and a 15-20 day delay in the that particular product), but, a NIC reset during a 72 hour soak (where we cycle the temperature up and down multiple times), isn&#x27;t something we would get stressed over.  That&#x27;s the entire idea behind having a watchdog - if something looks amiss, start clean.<p>It may have also been the case in the Pathfinder era that a &quot;Reset&quot; was acceptable behavior.<p>Also - depending on the nature of the watchdog reset - they may not have been able to capture a core dump - in which case, if there only a few resets - really hard to track down on a tight schedule.",1373022917

The biggest danger seems to be that people pick some random set of values & constructions and assume that&#x27;s good enough without further checking.<p>On the flip side this should have set off warning bells for them - it can be a little bit of a code smell to pick 1 for a configurable value in your encryption.  Not always a bad choice, but 1 has a lot of properties that can simplify various mathematical operations and   Basically setting a crypto value to the smallest positive integer (and a non-prime at that!) is like deciding that a set of numbers in your code should always be represented by two-byte signed ints.  Sometimes that&#x27;s _exactly_ what you want (say, various fast math libraries), but if you&#x27;re doing general purpose code you should really stop and think about whether you might end up with a value outside that.",1373022207

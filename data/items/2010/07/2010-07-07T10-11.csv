Any information / opinions on these questions are very appreciated. I am sorry if some of these are stupid. I talked to a lot of people, read on-line stuff but certain things are still not 100% clear.<p>1) I intend to open it through www.bizfillings.com . Their site looks legit and packed with information. Any experiences?<p>2) Delaware or f.ex. NY ? (does opening comp. in Delaware make you suspicious/border-case in your country? I have no ""evil"" intentions, don't care for tax after profit that much, do care for running expenses, complications, bureaucracy)<p>3) I will have 2-3 advisors with 0.5 - 3% stock and one helper with 12%. Is it cheaper to make the deal and give them shares before formation, or can it be easily/cheaply done after it. In what range are the (legal/bureau.) expenses associated with this after formation (I know angel deals cost 5-15k)<p>4) what do such advisors usually prefer: shares, options, ..? What is the simplest, cleanest way to do this. I want to include some vesting terms too. I intend to talk to them of course, but I would like to know more about it when I do.<p>5) How to open a Bank Acct. I heard it's hard to open it unless you physically come to and US bank (some say it's even harder after patriot act..). Can Bank Acct. be opened by a third person that would go into US bank with mandate from me? Would it-help/he-have to be one of the owners/officers of the company?<p>That is all for now.

Some quick examples: If you back up a Mac app using Dropbox and then restore it, nothing happens when you double-click on it because the executable file within it wasn't set to be executable. If you restore your ""downloaded files"" with Dropbox, the ""quarantine"" metadata won't be there so you won't get the ""This is an application downloaded from the Internet"" warning. If you restore a ""bundle"" (e.g. an iPhoto Library) the bundle won't look like a single file anymore -- it'll look like a folder; double-clicking on it would open the folder instead of launching iPhoto. Modification timestamps are all set to the current time, so if you used that information to find things in the past you're out of luck.",1278499979

Now, it's mostly a fun project - it wasn't something I ever created to make money on, but I'm getting to a point in my life where it's time to do more things to make money and do fewer ""let's see where it'll go"" fun projects.  (This saddens me, because I love to explore and play and create, but c'est la vie).  In any case, people like it, so there must be some value in it, and I've certainly invested some time in creating it, but so far I have not really found a way to <i>capture</i> some of the created value for myself.",1278497074

There's just one problem: (to my knowledge) there is currently no such thing as an open source clustered version of postgres. (There is a non-free clustered version, but it's not mature and its cost is prohibitive to small businesses.)<p>MySQL, even with its problems, is good enough. Moreover it accounts for future growth with MySQL Cluster. While MySQL Cluster is not yet mature (though this may change soon), it's there, it's open, and it's why I chose MySQL for my startup, even though I'm a Postgres veteran. <p>The problem with Postgres (and most databases without clustering) is when you need more resources your only option is to buy a bigger box to replace your current one. Eventually you'll have to buy specialized and super pricey machines...<p>With clustering you can add x-number of cheap commodity boxes to the existing set to meet your current needs.",1189435936

Good management also causes telecommuting, resulting in a telecommuting/satisfaction correlation.

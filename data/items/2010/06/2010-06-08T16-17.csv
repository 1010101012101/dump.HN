Android phones have had video this quality of video recording for months but don't have anything like iMovie which might make the hardware capabilities less appealing to someone. Another example is the front facing camera which you can presently get in the Sprint Evo. How many Android apps support switching camera sources? They're relying on Qik for video chat which has experienced major problems since the Evo's release. Who's accountable for that? Not Google, Not HTC, not even Sprint.

It's not clear what his goal was, but now he's jumping to the conclusion that fame doesn't bypass bureaucratic red tape.  However Zed wasn't satisfied with his small notoriety, and instead chose to accelerate it by deliberately becoming a flaming asshole writing vitriolic rants full of personal attacks.<p>I enjoyed Zed's rants, and I thought they were fairly insightful.  I certainly never interpreted them as being completely out of line, or that Zed was a total asshole.  He explicitly stated that he was testing the theory of being an internet blowhard to get attention.  Fine.<p>But the problem is now he's famous for being a blowhard.  He went from being moderately famous (and misunderstood) among the Ruby elite, to being widely famous for writing snarky articles.  Well, that's obviously not going to get you past any technical interviews.  Also, he decided to burn his bridges in the Ruby community, where I guarantee you he could have gotten plenty of jobs without an interview before.  Nowadays, as someone who does a lot of hiring, I can tell you that I would think twice before hiring Zed for fear of what kind of drama he would bring to the team.

You can hand the receipts over to a professional a little later, but handing over a half assed mess in Quickbooks or whatever is much worse IMHO.

If the oil companies had put together a consortium to research such ""worst case"" scenarios and develop equipment and procedures to deal with them quickly, then this would have been preventable.  (How about an even worse scenario: oil rig blows up, sinks, smashes the blowout preventer.  Even Michael Bay can think of that one.)  The oil companies could've done this, but chose instead to gamble on what they thought was a ""good enough"" lower level of safety.<p>No one can be 100% sure all of the machinery and safety mechanisms and procedures will work, but it is possible to make the likelihood reasonably small and then <i>add an additional fallback position</i> that you are pretty certain will work.

It always baffles me when I see and hear people in an oral discussion come up with interesting thoughts <i>while they are talking</i>.  For me it always takes a couple of days of silent contemplation to see the interesting implications of something.<p>When people talk to me I sometimes just can't hear what they're saying, but whatever it is I stash the sound of it somewhere in my head so I can focus on processing it once they stop talking.  The problem is of course that often people don't stop talking and the stack gets higher and higher until the bottom falls out and I stop paying attention completely.  And if there's a TV in the room, it'll suck me in before anyone even says a word, and they'll have to yell and wave to get me back.<p>But when it does work out, I can recall their entire monologue word for word.  I can still recall some of the things people have told me as much as 15 years ago, word for word.  (My memory is a total sieve for other things though.)<p>Regardless, I'm pretty capable of thinking ""big thoughts"", say a recurring closure and how it affects/relates to the scope chain, the call stack, the namespace chain (Ruby is <i>weird</i> this way), and maybe a couple other complicating dimensions.

I have tried to answer this before, and always fallen flat -- I think that the reason is that if it could be transmitted by writing, I would have picked it up without the need to have spent all that money and time.  But that sounds like such a cop-out!  So I'll try:<p>At the Ivy League school I went to (and I did not study a technical subject here -- it was an architecture school), I was surrounded by people who had an agenda for their lives -- in fact, they often already had their career plotted out, and many were already working on the side.  School was for them a set of tools (people, information, opportunities) to be hacked resourcefully to get what they wanted.  At Big State U, the kids seemed to think of themselves more as subject to the whims of an institution, and to think of the institution as something they needed to please to get ""a degree.""  The degree was hardly worth mentioning at Ivy League School; the professors were seen as either equals or, in a sense, servants/tools.  The Ivy League kids also seemed far more ready to create their own programs and experiences; they would see a niche, form a group, and suddenly the school was filled with minority kids learning architecture on the weekends; or suddenly a local youth group had a student-made meeting place.<p>Of course this kind of volunteerism and spirit of service happened at Big State U as well!  What I thought was really different at I.L.S. was the self-assurance and lack of self-consciousness involved; these kids saw ownership and power in the world as their natural right -- they seemed to act and take command as naturally as another young person might turn on the television.<p>I hope this doesn't sound arrogant or somehow fanboyish; I am trying to explain how being thrown together with these people for years changed me deeply -- made me both able to see beyond where I came from and to be more proud of it, and of myself.  It was really almost more a matter of physical knowledge -- of mimicry and group identification, perhaps -- than of something you could pick up in a book.",1237814498

  MS: some problems still around for more than 20 years (from MS DOS era till today);
  SUN: almost 10 years to fix trivial problem;
  Apple: good support;
  IBM: good support of official standards, not so good support for net standards;
  Google: some problems are still around for years, nobody response to my letters, no way to fix.
  Linux/*BSD/GNU: very easy to fix (or create) problem in any supported program, much harder when program in no longer in development (need to maintain our own version of program in our own distribution).<p>All these problems are trivial (charset support, proper charset translation, national keyboard support, message translations, etc.), so they are very easy to fix. Currently, then only OS'es that have no problems with Ukrainian language is GNU/Linux. Even Non-GNU/Linux systems are easy to fix in most cases.<p>I agree with Stallman: web services are closed, so they  introduce high risk for our freedom.",1237813255

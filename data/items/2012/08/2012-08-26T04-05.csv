There's only one symbol in each plugin the application knows about, the init_<pluginname> function, but at least one symbol is usually necessary.<p>Do you mean the plugins calling PluginManager functions to register hooks? I just wanted to present a simple method without a lot of code. Using structs is an alternative, more convenient in some cases. One problem with it is that it imposes an ABI, while one registration function per hook does not.<p>Anyhow, this was just a basic example showing how plugins can work. I do plan to explore alternatives in the future, and specifically looking at existing pluggable applications (Apache, for instance)",1345957010

Finding good frontend developers is REALLY hard - to be a great frontend guy these days, working on modern web apps, you need to have strong engineering chops, with knowledge of the html5 apis, css3 and serious JS experience, including an understanding of memory and performance management in large frontend-heavy apps; ideally have worked on a couple of medium size apps with 5-7 person teams; probably have at least some exposure to the current JS framework scene; ideally (for our stack) have experience with preprocessors like sass or stylus and coffeescript; have good design sense and the ability to work in a collaborative feedback loop with a designer, etc etc. It's a really cross-functional role. There's a lot more people who ""know HTML and CSS"" but have never worked on serious apps, or have solid JS chops but can't produce design with reasonable fidelity to save their lives.<p>A relationship with a recruiter who understood this ""candidate profile"" and could bring me people who would be a good fit, not just resumes with ""HTML"", ""CSS"", ""Javascript"" and ""5 years of experience"" on them, would be worth its weight in gold.",1345956741

Knowing how to calculate stress in civil/structural engineering doesn&#x27;t mean you are an engineer. You need a job. You need an internship if you were a student.<p>2. It is quite dumb to assume we build software in the same way that bridge is built. That&#x27;s essentially what Water Fall method would do. You build the blueprint precisely, build a prototype and then build the actual bridge. I don&#x27;t see why the author would assume we think we were classical engineer. I never assumed we would be using the same technique all the time.",1384124323

Maybe Gates&#x27; whole career was one huge egotistical venture into believing he could spend the world&#x27;s money better than they could, and he saw his role at Microsoft as simply bringing that about in the most efficient way possible.

It uses Reportlab under the hood. (Thanks to the Reportlab team for great work.) xtopdf provides a somewhat higher-level and simpler interface. Has some support for, as input formats: text, DBF, CSV, TSV, XLS, MSAccess, ODBC, (via standard ODBC, pyodbc or pypyodbc), SQLAlchemy, MongoDB, DOCX. It can be used both to create composite PDF reports (for business or other organizations), from any combination of the supported input formats, and to create PDF ebooks from text or XML content.

6708808,comment,6704679,6707708,1,0,klibertp,,,"I think it&#x27;s not &quot;fundamentally different&quot;. Type info is there in the code, it&#x27;s just much more implicit and requires much more work to extract and use. One thing which does just this is Jedi project (for python) and it&#x27;s absolutely astonishing how much data you can get out of it!<p>Also I think that dynamic languages were meant to run inside a dynamic environment. For example in Pharo Smalltalk (probably all Smalltalks) every single piece of metadata <i>is</i> runtime data. Static analysis has no sense, because in Pharo there is no &quot;static&quot; at all - everything happens inside a living environment and (for example) as soon as you write a method it&#x27;s turned into CompiledMethod object which has all the data about the method you would ever need for you to query easily. Good luck implementing better refactoring tools than those in Smalltalk for any other language.<p>Essentially the same approach is used in Emacs Lisp. For example, if you see a function you don&#x27;t recognize, you can jump to it&#x27;s definition. The thing here is that Emacs doesn&#x27;t know where the definition is because of static analysis - it just has this compiled chunk of code in memory which happens to have a name you&#x27;re looking for. This chunk of code knows a location of it&#x27;s definition and many other pieces of metadata which are all available on runtime. It of course doesn&#x27;t work if the function isn&#x27;t already loaded into Emacs.<p>Most statically typed languages retain almost no type data in runtime. Most dynamically typed languages have almost no type data on compile time. I see this as largely equivalent.<p>So I guess what I want to say is that there is no fundamental difference in what the dynamic and static languages are, but there is (and should be) a very fundamental difference in how they are used. Choosing the between the two is I think almost exclusively a matter of preference. A good programmer should feel comfortable with both, though.",1384123433

It creates a bit of an &quot;overhead&quot; (you compile it twice), and you actually don&#x27;t really see what happens in the layer below the layer you&#x27;re working in: the JS/Java/Python layer.<p>Say you&#x27;ve been working in the language FooBar, which creates, say, Javascript. Now most examples of code generators I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t really care about the readability of the code they output. They have a readable, human-created bootstrap.js loading the default handler, and a bunch of semi-obfuscated .js floating around.<p>Usually, this doesn&#x27;t matter. However, I see a lot of these languages appear on HN lately. The problem I&#x27;m starting to see is that, when we&#x27;ve got 10,000 alternatives to FooBar, people all start using different FooBar-like languages, and it becomes a mess. If you, for example, like to write in BarFoo, then we have a problem. We both understand JS, but the generated code is a mess. What do?<p>Then again I could be wrong. :P",1384123384

6708797,comment,6704661,6705472,1,0,csandreasen,,,"You&#x27;re right - most of this bill focuses more section 501.  That&#x27;s where most of the debate in Congress has been, as it specifically collects on US citizens.  You have a good reason for concern on the section 702 parts, but I disagree on why.  The part on section 702 doesn&#x27;t authorize collection against US persons - it&#x27;s strangely worded.  &quot;A query of the contents of communications <i>acquired under this section</i> with a selector known to be used by a United States person&quot; - in other words, the collection must already be acquired in the documented pursuit of a valid foreign intelligence target under section 702 (b) [1].  The analyst can then search the collection for selectors known to be used by a US person.  (EDIT: reworded for clarification) The bill goes on to say that this may only be done for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence information and must be documented and reported to Congress, DoJ, FISC, etc.<p>The concern here is that it may be a loophole to allow <i>reverse targeting</i> - collecting foreigner&#x27;s communications not because the foreigner is interesting, but rather because the Americans that foreigner is in contact with are interesting.  Personally, I&#x27;d like to see more language in the bill to address this.<p>Your second loophole doesn&#x27;t apply to the NSA (they&#x27;re not a law enforcement agency), but is a concern for the FBI.  It doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me why it would be worded this way in her bill, since the potential loophole is addressed in Section 704 of the existing law:<p><i>&quot;No element of the intelligence community may intentionally target, for the purpose of acquiring foreign intelligence information, a United States person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States under circumstances in which the targeted United States person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required if the acquisition were conducted inside the United States for law enforcement purposes, unless a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has entered an order with respect to such targeted United States person or the Attorney General has authorized an emergency acquisition pursuant to subsection (c) or (d), respectively, or any other provision of this Act.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;d also like to address your targeting US citizens argument:<p><i>Although 702 has been used to target US citizens [2], the law doesn&#x27;t reflect this usage -- yet.</i><p>That&#x27;s a bold claim, and the evidence you provide doesn&#x27;t seem to support that.  I&#x27;m not saying that is hasn&#x27;t necessarily happened, but the evidence isn&#x27;t there.  From the article you cite:<p><i>&quot;While the FAA 702 minimization procedures approved on 3 October 2011 now allow for use of certain United States person names and identifiers as query terms when reviewing collected FAA 702 data,&quot; the glossary states, &quot;analysts may NOT/NOT [not repeat not] implement any USP [US persons] queries until an effective oversight process has been developed by NSA and agreed to by DOJ/ODNI [Office of the Director of National Intelligence].&quot;<p>...<p>The document  which is undated, though metadata suggests this version was last updated in June 2012  does not say whether the oversight process it mentions has been established or whether any searches against US person names have taken place.</i><p>I&#x27;d like to see a document showing specific examples of instances where 702 was used to target Americans and what the NSA&#x27;s reason for doing so was.  This shows a blurb saying that certain minimization procedures have been proposed, but have not been approved, so analysts are still not allowed to query against US persons.<p>The article goes on to cite leaked minimization procedures [2].  Those procedures talk a lot about what to do if the NSA comes across US communications, procedures standardizing how to determine whether or not a selector belongs to a US person, what to do if an analyst finds out that they&#x27;ve inadvertently targeted a US person, what to do if a foreign target comes to the US, etc.<p>There&#x27;s a whole section in 702 detailing how minimization procedures are to established and updated (see section entitled &quot;Judicial review of certifications and procedures&quot;) - the Attorney General and FISC both need to sign off.  The blurb seems to fit with the bill that Feinstein is putting forward.  It&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess as to whether the minimization procedures were approved by the courts and DoJ first and is being legitimized by the bill, or if the courts/DoJ said the law won&#x27;t back up that interpretation and Feinstein is now trying to fill it in.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr6304/text"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr6304/text</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-without-warrant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-...</a>",1384123283

It is true that the current network of validator nodes isn&#x27;t very diverse, but rippled has only been open source a couple of months. That will change as more gateways come online (e.g. the xrptalk validator node has snapswap in its UNL, as you can see <a href=""https://xrptalk.org/ripple.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xrptalk.org/ripple.txt</a>).<p>OpenCoin/Ripple Labs can&#x27;t steal funds at any account (unless they have the private keys to that account). They could attempt to freeze an arbitrary account by ignoring any broadcasted transactions associated with that account, and only voting on candidate sets which don&#x27;t include them. But that would be noticeable, as the transactions would get stuck in the candidate sets of all the honest nodes. If there are enough honest nodes with overlapping UNL&#x27;s, then the Ripple Labs nodes would have to accept it, or be split/forked from the network.<p>The paid transaction fees are destroyed, so they are effectively paid to all XRP holders, in proportion to their holdings. This is actually similar to the proof-of-stake scheme in ppcoin.<p>Also, the base fee gets changed by upgrading rippled. There is a pseudo-transaction associated with changing the base fee and the minimum reserve, but these pseudo-transactions are used to prevent the network from agreeing to a fee change (or implementation of new features) until enough validator nodes have the upgraded ripple (upgraded nodes will &quot;vote&quot; on the fee change).",1384121228

We were issued with a signal 4 warning at Category 5 as it passed the northern parts around 2-3am. Yolanda didn&#x27;t really make an real impact on the island - We only lost communications and electricity from about 9pm to 6pm the next day, had some minor roads flooded and little damage on property.<p>My best guess is that we got the backspin of the storm and was left with out great damage.<p>Before the storm past, tourists were leaving, locals were deciding to either stay or evacuate to higher grounds inland and expats tried to follow. There was problems leaving the island by boat because of the big waves and airplanes had already aborted landing on Monday. \nThe risk was that either being hit by mudslides because of the expected 100mm rainfall, or being trapped inside of your house due the strong winds and storm surge.<p>Everyone seemed well informed and took appropriate action well before Yolanda would possibly hit us. We stocked up on water and food enough for a couple of days on Wednesday, on Thursday the concrete house i&#x27;m staying at got packed with people trying to get safe/shelter.<p>At night, Yolanda made its presence with wind and heavy rain, but thanks to low tide, we where lucky to stay un-flooded by the additional (reported) 5.5m sea-level rise.<p>A few hours later, it hit Tacloban/Samar (200km from us) and destroyed a lot in its path. The towns/islands where effected so hard because of high tide, which enabled the flooding.<p>I want to make clear that, the Government/Community/WeatherStations did a great job informing the residencies about the possible dangers.<p>A lot of people did evacuate, but as I said before, there was only choices between uncertainty available. I will mention that the locals here seem to have become accustom to the weather due to the ~20 typhoons/storms per year, and also seem to take it a bit lighter then they sometimes should. The weather can shift and the typhoons direction can change in an instant, hitting the least expected areas.<p>Im just hoping that the incoming storm wont make to difficult for the Philippines to recover!

I&#x27;m not a hacker or a software engineer and don&#x27;t really belong on the site, so don&#x27;t comment. I&#x27;m just some random guy who plays a lot of video games, uses a lot of reddit and has a rough interest in the technology industry. By extension, I watch a lot of YouTube videos from various channels that offer playthroughs (or &#x27;Let&#x27;s Plays&#x27;) of games. This is why I say the following:<p>Unfortunately at this stage I think you are completely wrong. I suspect that you don&#x27;t use YouTube very much and so are not seeing what has happened. I&#x27;m sorry if this sounds snide, it isn&#x27;t meant to.<p>YouTube had a reputation with some as providing the worst internet comments outside 4chan. I doubt few could imagine it getting worse. This recent Google+ integration seems to be an experiment on Google&#x27;s part to prove how naive that belief was.<p>You can now post hyperlinks in comments. This has led to people spamming links to &#x27;screamer&#x27; videos, including the potential to disguise these links as the comment expanding feature. Comments can now have seemingly unlimited length, or at least are massively extended compared to the previous system; This has led to people spamming ASCII art images of genitals, pedobear, naked women, memes like the super shibe &#x27;doge&#x27;, and reams and reams of repeating text like &quot;#FUCKGOOGLE&quot;. Actual advertiser spammers are soon going to catch onto this ability, so the messages offering free copies of popular video games like Minecraft no longer have to come with the polite request to copypaste them into your address bar - they can just be clicked. This is just the tip of the iceberg in the first few days. I know I&#x27;m not alone in wondering how long it will be before someone finds a way to exploit these new comments as a vector for directly delivering malware. And even if the hyperlinks are removed, it has created a enormous new canvas on which trolls, children and idiots can paint their own brand of humour. There does not currently seem to be any way of blanket blocking URLs, instead needing a filter list set up with every potential combination of keywords and domains.<p>The kind of people who create and post this stuff are the kind of people least likely to care about creating multiple throwaway accounts or having this rubbish leak into other websites. Anecdotally it seems that people who may care enough to try and contribute meaningfully are now more likely to abandon the comments section and Google+ out of frustration (just as this article concludes with). This could be turn out to be nothing but a win for the trolls, especially considering that removing the new features enabling them would be to render the system identical to the old one.<p>I don&#x27;t like the channel myself but a _very_ popular personality called PewDiePie has now disabled comments on all his videos due to the change. Other channels seem to be following suit or considering it. If you would like to hear a very honest spiel about the frustration these changes provide, search for a channel called NerdCubed and look at his recent videos for a video on the comment section. The comments that could be found under your average YouTube video were already enough to drive a content creator to exasperation as is.

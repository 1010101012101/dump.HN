Through careful thinking and reading up on philosophies of human rights and ethics, many people (myself included) have carefully cultivated values that take a deep offence to very public things deliberately crafted to offend nobody.<p>I mean, really, how long until the only way to offend someone with an iPhone is to chuck it in their face? (""Be glad that wasn't an unmanned drone you just got hit by!"")<p>Or just write ""for the prettiest one"" on it, leave it at a wedding party and joyously partake of a hotdog (no bun).",1346929155

Sure it doesn't work as well as LinkedIn profiles, as CVs come in many shapes these days, all trying to outdo each other in style. But not everyone is on LinkedIn yet, and CVs are still the established norm.<p>If I had a candidate refuse to give me a CV, and told me to look at his LinkedIn profile, I'd assume he was a dick, and hard to work with. That candidate would be filtered out straight away. Not because I think I'm being too stubborn about wanting to see a CV, hell LinkedIn can make a CV for you, but because the candidate was being stubborn, and rude.<p>It sounds like you have the advantage of being sought after in this case though, and so some power does reside in your hands to be careless with your approach to job offers. But I wouldn't suggest that everybody takes after your example, for some a job offer is a precious thing, and promoting yourself in the format desired by the employer is a length those people would happily endeavour to fulfil.",1346929092

It's almost a given that anyone shooting Canon owns the 24-105L, so when opting for a wider angle lens the 17-40 and 16-35 are your two most common choices.  The 16-35 gives you the wide-angle, PLUS lower f/stop (The 24-105L is f/4.0 also)<p>I don't think you can tell with any degree of certainly which specific lens was used for these shots.",1346928555

The ones on dealer lots have been ordered by the dealers, who have an idea on what combinations sell well.<p>I visited the factory in Munich and you can see a big line of doors, seats, carpets, etc feeding up to the assembly line.  Each is computer controlled, and when the intended vehicle gets to the seat install station, the correct seat (style, fabric, RHD/LHD) meets the correct car.  When the doors arrive, they've got the right interior bits already in them, and all the wiring loom bits match up with what is already in the car, even if the prior 20 cars have all had different options (color, trim, options, etc).<p>Meanwhile, at the back of the factory, JIT delivery trucks are delivering the next set of seats/steering wheels/seatbelts etc - all barcoded, all ready to be loaded onto the assembly lines in the correct order.<p>It's truly eye-opening to watch a highly automated factory like this in operation.  When a dealer in the USA presses the 'order' button - suppliers, factory, workers - everything lines up and out pops a fully finished, completely unique car.",1346927071

4483553,comment,4464426,4465433,1,0,tripzilch,,,"As soon as you start censoring certain kinds of information (whether it's a topical news aggegrator mashup or anti-gay propaganda ... or both) you are taking a political stance. Period. Censorship means you stop being neutral.<p>Now whether this stance exerts any meaningful influence on society and public opinion, largely depends on the public mindshare this entity has.<p><i>You</i> are arguing the wrong way around and attacking straw men of ""conspiracy theory mongering"". Please go and reply to those actual comments that say these things, if they are there, you can probably find them all the way below on the page, downvoted by the Apple fanboi and electronic freedom proponent alike.<p>And not particularly as a reply to you, I thought I'd look up Freedom of Speech, see what it exactly means. I thought, for something to become a Freedom-of-Speech (Human Rights) issue, you need to have a political entity that enforces it (such as the imaginary claim made by your straw men). But it seems to be a bit broader than that:<p>Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states that:<p>""Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas <i>through any media</i> and <i>regardless of frontiers</i>.""<p>I highlighted those two parts. ""Through any media"" means that, if this app would <i>also</i> get refused by the Android platform, the author is practically prevented from using the medium ""smartphone app"" to impart his message. Fortunately, Android is open (even if their app market would reject it).  That does (IMVPO) not make it right for Apple, because they do nothing to preserve this freedom, it exists <i>despite</i> their actions, not unhindered because of it.<p>The ""regardless of frontiers"" part, not entirely serious, I know that it refers to geopolitical frontiers, but it could be easily extended to the walls of Apple's ""walled garden"": what it means to say is that you should be able to freely impart your information from Nation X to Nation Y. This blockage of the Drone news aggegrator means that he cannot in fact reach the people of ""Nation iPhone-user"".<p>(The fact that perhaps most people of Nation iPhone do not <i>want</i> to know, funnily enough is shared by a lot of Chinese people as well)",1346926805

4483544,comment,4479427,4483038,2,0,brc,,,"I was going to add that NZ dumped the idea of a local car industry in the 1980s and relaxed its car import laws.  As a result the average car age is much lower, and the average cost of a car is much lower - leaving large amounts of disposable income for NZ residents to spend on other things (ie, not Dealer/Manufacturer profit margins + Federal taxes).  As you have shown - when people can import a vehicle from anywhere they like, they do, and no doubt that puts serious pressure on dealer + manufacturer margins and there would be very little price gouging going on.<p>You should hear Toyota Australia go on about parallell imports - they condemn the cars as unsafe - despite those cars being built in Toyota factories in Japan.  It is mind boggling.<p>Meanwhile, the last round of Federal Government 'assistance' (or co-investment, as they now spin it) that was given to GM was mostly used for redundancy payouts for factory staff.<p>Support for the regulation + taxation + duty protection for the Australian car industry has bipartisan support - so it's not likely to go anywhere any time soon.",1346926554

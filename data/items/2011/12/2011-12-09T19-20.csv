3335312,comment,3333831,3334670,4,0,georgemcbay,,,"pinch-to-zoom is obvious once you have a display capable of multitouch input.   The whole reason it works so well is that it is mimicking a real world interaction that is fully intuitive (read: obvious!).  Should specific implementations of multitouch input technology be patent-able? Yes.  Should pinch-to-zoom and other obvious gestures be patent-able on top of that? Obviously not.<p>What drives patent applications for things like pinch-to-zoom isn't novelty, but companies with vast legal teams who throw patents against the wall to see what sticks.  My name appears on some patent applications.  Not because those patents describe things that are novel (because they don't) but because the company I was working for at the time went into a ""patent everything"" phase.   I regret allowing them to even use my name on those applications.<p>All of this is ultimately the USPTO's fault for basically rubber stamping whatever comes through the door and letting the courts figure it out.  Filing clearly stupid patents should come with a penalty akin to frivolous lawsuits, but at this point I doubt the system will ever change, at least until the USA completes its long but accelerating slide into economic irrelevance.",1323460786

But if the system of N people has C < N people who will make or approve corrupt decisions, and each person had to have 1 randomly chosen person sign off on each possibly corrupt decision, you go from C/N chance of a randomly chosen decision being a corrupt one to a (C/N)^2 chance.  If the system has a relatively low percentage of corrupt people, that could be a big win.<p>If C is too large, you could improve the scheme by adding another sign-off to increase it to (C/N)^3, as well as by punishing the original requester and anybody who approves along the way when a corrupt decision is caught.",1323460695

3335265,comment,3329676,3332692,1,0,dxbydt,,,">I'm confused as to the meaning there. What is it about phone calls that follow an exponential distribution?<p>Sorry for the confusion. Lemme clarify a bit. Say you work at an office. 9am to 5pm. 8 hours a day.<p>scala> 60x60x8<p>res45: Int = 28800<p>So a phone call can arrive in any one of those 28,800 seconds. Putting it another way, the probability p of getting a phone call at any particular second is very remote, but the number of seconds aka trials is n=28800 ie. very large. Anytime you have very small p and very large n, that's a nice candidate for a particular member of the exponential family of distributions. In this case, the arrival times of phone calls to your office will be Poisson.<p>Say you hire an office assistant to count the number of phone calls every day, and she tells you after a month that your office averages say 24 calls a day. That 24 is your mu, the mean of the Poison distribution.At that point you know everything you need to know about the distribution, because Poisson is a discrete distribution whose probability p is specified entirely by the mean mu!<p>So you can go off and compute the probability p like so:<p>scala> import scala.math.{exp,pow}<p>scala> def fact(n:Int):Int = { if( n>1) n<i>fact(n-1) else 1}<p>scala> def p(mu:Int,n:Int) = {pow(mu,n)</i>exp(-mu)/fact(n)}<p>The chances of your office getting 4 or fewer phone calls by noon is then easy to figure out. Since you average 24 calls in 8 hours, you should average 9 calls by noon. So the probability of getting 4 or fewer calls would be<p>scala> (0 to 4).map(p(9,_)).sum<p>res46: Double = 0.05496364149510491<p>So you have a 5% chance of getting 4 or fewer calls by noon. If someone offers to bet a million dollars that your office will get 4 or fewer calls by noon, the odds of winning that bet are 1 in 19.<p>edit:formatted for better readability.",1323460040

HP is fighting hard to remain relevant, and a vibrant competitor to iOS and Android would push them back into relevancy.  Everything tech seems to be heading toward mobile, and if HP can establish a firm foothold there, they'll be a stronger company for it.<p>Now, I'm not saying this will happen, but at least it's possible now.  webOS wasn't going to do anything for anyone sitting in a corner.  Personally, I think a lot of its success depends on if/how they manage to set up a competitive webOS app store, facilitate at least one device that can run it, and letting webOS run as openly as possible on that device.  Open source advocates would flock to buy and develop for a device running on a truly open OS with an open development model.<p>I'm also curious about a compatibility layer for Android.  Dalvik has already been ported to maemo/meego, although it's closed-source.  I'm relatively sure someone will now port Dalvik to webOS.  I think a webOS with a vibrant, open-source community, able to run Android apps, could pose a significant challenge to portions of the Android market (to iOS to a lesser extent).",1323459625

So even if someone was being malicious they still couldn't take out more than that amount (and I've SMS notifications set up for all transfers over a fairly low limit too, so they couldn't just come back and take another payment every day until I was cleaned out). It would certainly inconvenience me, but that's just as true with a credit card (and that would probably take me longer to notice). And, as I said earlier, I've had experience of problems with both, and the credit card ones were much more hassle to resolve.<p>b) my current account is multi-currency, so even if someone managed to clean out all my euros, I'd still have cash in GBP, USD, etc.<p>c) most of my money isn't in my current account anyway, so even if <i>that</i> got completely cleaned out, in all currencies, I'd still have money in my various other accounts.",1323459422

Please let's be reasonable about what is worth rewriting and what is not.<p>I was mocking your statement, in case you missed it. I <i>don't</i> think that if you don't write cross platform code you are lazy -- especially not high performance code that derives some of its performance from platform specific features!<p>And no one needs to rewrite anything! Just use your own fork with your PATCHES. Read my lips again: NO REWRITE NEEDED!<p>> This attitude is why so many man-hours are lost in the community, and why so many pointless forks exist.<p>For some reason, you believe the community owes you something. And what exactly are those ""so many pointless forks that exist""? GCC has had 5 significant forks through its life, non of them pointless.<p>> Come now, do you honestly believe this is a more efficient/sound/useful solution than trying to get antirez to just add support in mainline Redis (without even having to start from scratch)?<p>Of course it is efficient for parasites like you when antirez spends the time -- especially since you don't care about development efficiency and speed on Linux which are essentially guaranteed to be harmed, at least in the short term and possibly for a long time to come.<p>The only question is: why should antirez care?<p>> Care to elaborate? I'm not fluent in ""tired cliche"".<p>SPEND TIME (which translates to SPEND YOUR INCOME which translates to SPEND MONEY) MAINTAINING A WINDOWS FORK, TO ANTIREZ STANDARD OF PERFORMANCE ON LINUX AND CLEANLINESS OF IMPLEMENTATION, and if you manage to achieve that, I can almost guarantee he'll merge it in. The problem is, it might not actually be doable -- but TALKING ABOUT IT IS CHEAP FOR YOU, so that's what you do -- which is what others tend to call BULLSHIT. Is this elaboration enough?<p>> My team and I do a lot of cross-platform C code, and this would've made our lives a lot easier.<p>Translation: We would have gotten something for nothing.<p>Question: Does your team release any of its code? If so, can I have a look? If not, why not -- and why do you feel entitled to someone else's source code?<p>> Then again, if people complained (as I did here!) perhaps things may have gone better?<p>Oh, you are so naive. The only reason the posix subsystem existed in the first place was so that NT would be eligible to compete in Government tenders (predominantly, but not only, US). It was always a 3rd class citizen, hardly supported or usable, although it was very successful in the business sense of letting MS compete in those tenders.<p>Microsoft only fixed browser standard compliance (and not fully) when they realized they're starting to lose the browser war again. That's 10 years of very vocal complaints that went unheard, and for a very simple reason: It conflicts with their lock-in strategy. Same thing about the posix extensions.<p>You might be a very good developer for all I know, but you really fail in understanding how the world works.",1323457264

I think you're actually right about that.<p>Have you come to this thread to bash anyone who ""admits"" to using Microsoft software? It feels like that to me.<p>I don't consider buying software from Microsoft to be ""choosing a side"", just like I don't consider buying Apple products to be choosing a side in the child labor wars, just like I don't consider buying a chocolate bar means I choose the side against slavery in Africa. If you're as hard-line as you demand, everybody becomes a hypocrite.<p>> Cool. Don't be surprised that your choice of platform and tools, e.g. the latest-and-greatest .NET 4 Entity Framework, limits your access to other tools, e.g. redis. Life is a tradeoff.<p>Completely true! Did I ever say anything to the contrary?<p>There's a big difference between ""There are valid use cases for Redis on Windows"" and ""I demand that Antirez port Redis to Windows, now, for free"". I really only made the former point, but I have the feeling that you're passionately ranting against the latter.",1323457257

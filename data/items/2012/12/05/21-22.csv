Sometimes when you disagree with someone's conclusions, it's hard to see the merit of their reasoning.<p><i>We need to...</i><p>There are two complications to this. One is that the ""we"" of Linux development has never and will never have the kind of coherence that it takes to appeal to an extremely large audience. (Even calling it ""Linux"" isn't always agreed-upon). There are a great many people working on Linux or making things from Linux, but they are not all going in the same direction. This is both a strength and a weakness.<p>The second is not so much a different reason as it is an example of a major weakness of this style of development: It's a demonstrably inefficient way of addressing the needs of certain kinds of users. The list of things you say need to be fixed with the Linux desktop, which is quite typical and also quite incomplete, has also <i>remained constant</i> for more than a decade as year after year ""of the Linux Desktop"" passed by. Although the situation has improved, ""We"" have not moved on to a better class of problems because most people working on them <i>want</i> to use the terminal, or at least <i>don't mind</i> editing text files for configuration, and correspondingly are not very good at addressing the needs of people very much unlike them.",1354744691

This company operates 2 miles from where I live.  It couldn't get any safer.<p>They slowly quit working on it and then quit and started ignoring me until I sued them.  I won in court and got a judgement to collect my money.<p>Apparently this doesnt matter, and the owner of this company simply continues to operate, just without paying bills, such as my $10K judgement against him/company.<p>This was 2008 and my full time job just laid everyone off, about one month after committing my money to this startup.<p>I later foreclosed and went through quite a storm of financial loss, and life changes.<p>All while developing my next startup ideas!<p>Wooohoooo, I'm still alive and I know my persistence will pay.<p>So, my answer?  Evaluate your loss if you can truly evaluate it, grab the obvious mistakes and make sure you dont do them again.<p>Millions of people every day don't attempt their own startups due to what happened to me.  Fear.  Fear of loss.  Fear of exactly what happened to me.  It's incredibly discouraging that people/companies can get away with this, and it effects more people than just me.  See... when i tell my story about failure, 9 out of 10 people get further away from ever overcoming their typical fears about starting up.

My point about generation stands, though - no password scheme stands in a vacuum, and if whatever you do catches on, you can guarantee software will be made to exploit the low entropy passwords on that scheme (for example, attacks can now include tricks like taking the website name - LinkedIn - and performing common mutations to generate passwords to attempt: L1nk3dIn1)<p>If it became really common, people would make rainbow tables for it too. All you'd need to do is create a reduction function that maps back into the set <passwords formed from concatenating common words> :)<p>This applies to all forms of password generation though: ultimately, entropy is important, and if you care about your security you should know whether the entropy levels of your passwords afford you the security you want or need.",1354744400

It does not matter which is the primary means of providing social order.<p>It is particularly pointless because ""being a government"" is not an interesting measure outside of the realms of philosophy and ideology. There are very many governments that would have done the world a great service by ceasing to ""be a government"".<p>Personally, I'd argue that a government that provides no welfare are often a net negative - many of the early nation states saw enormous societal harm resulting from law enforcement and military being used as a bulwark against the effects of the lack of working welfare systems.<p>E.g. I'm from Norway. A large proportion of the Norwegian emigrants who settled in the US (like the Irish) came during periods of extreme poverty and often starvation in Norway (Norway didn't become wealthy really until oil finds in the 60's, and until at least the 20's it was really a quite poor country). Poor people could get forcibly put to work in poor-houses, as they were in many other countries. Yet the state at the time used the police to restrict emigration:<p>You needed permission, or you could get thrown in jail for trying to leave. It was seen as essential in order to provide social order. As it was in many other countries.<p>> Here is how I support my claim that police and military are the primary means of providing social order. Can our government exist without welfare? It has. Can it exist without the public school system?<p>Can it exist without government run police? Many governments have historically largely deferred policing to volunteers (UK for example, where volunteers still have a role in policing). Without military? There are examples of that too - the modern nation state with standing armies is a relatively new invention and prior to that at least some societies had what amounted to functioning governments without military <i>or</i> police - Iceland, for example, which had a functioning parliament and established laws and court system for hundreds of years before it got a government run police  and military.<p>While the nature of a government that is not a monopoly provider of violence and force is by necessity very different, that does not mean they can not exist.",1354743566

4878741,comment,4877167,4877167,12,0,zissou,,,"I faced a similar problem in academia, but it was in economics. I started my undergrad career as a computer science major, later ending up in economics, and I went on for my PhD in economics after finishing my BA. For those that aren't familiar, a PhD in economics is a lot like a PhD in mathematics. If you don't already respect economists mathematical ability, you really should, but that's not my point here because math is just a tool, and contains no absolute truths for the social scientist.<p>In an effort to combine solid theoretical research with well built empirical models, I learned how to program Python to scrape data from web sites. Since nobody around me knew anything about computer science, I found myself having to teach myself everything when it came to ""how would I write a program that collects X things from Y products in Z Internet markets"". In the beginning, when I was learning to use Python libraries for doing HTTP requests (eventually converging to using 'requests'), how to parse that HTML (started with BeautifulSoup and then converged to 'lxml'), and how to aggregate and analyze that data (eventually converging to 'pandas'), I had to spend a lot of time learning the ins and outs of Python. To this day, I still think it was a great choice because Python has changed the way I approach any kind of business question that could be answered with a well defined empirical model.<p>As a research assistant, I would spend 12 hours writing scripts to automate the collection and analysis of data for some project I discussed with a professor. The day after writing that script, I would go and talk to the professor and want to discuss some of the computational issues with the script (say, encoding issues, or even the use of computers on EC2 to help collect massive amounts of data every day), but the economics professors would not care at all to hear about any of that. ""You need to be studying the economics, not the computer science"" they'd tell me. This would infuriate me, because in my mind, if you wanted to be able to ask all these interesting questions that rely on the data, then you need to spend time to make sure you've done the computation correctly and in a way that is reliable. Maybe I dug my own grave by showing my excitement as I began to become more fluent with Python, and thus more confident in my abilities.<p>Nonetheless, I eventually decided to leave my PhD program because my interests in topics that lie at the intersection of computer science and economics were a bad fit for my program. It was so disheartening to me because I truly loved economics, and was confident that what I intended to do with my PhD research was going to be unique and lay a framework for the field of industrial organization. However, the experience I received in my program was the lack of an adviser that could truly help me achieve what I wanted to do, and a regular negative response to anything I'd bring up that was out of the realm of what my professors were used to talking to graduate students about.<p>Overall, as my tone may signal, graduate school has left me very, very bitter.",1354743558

The best historical example of this is the Manhattan project.  Sure, given enough time, defense entrepreneurs would eventually research and develop the same technology, and maybe at a much lower cost.  However, the time-value of obtaining the bomb first could <i>arguably</i> justify the enormous expenditure (something around $20 billion in today's dollars).  Now, like I said, this is mostly playing devil's advocate -- as an economics student, I tend to agree with you for most investments.  However, I do think that out of all potential investments, green energy has the best case for justifying spending these billions of dollars.<p>Put another way, if we could pay $50 billion to develop a renewable, clean energy source right now, then it would probably be worth it -- even if it would take Elon Musk only 10 years to do it and for $50 million.",1354743240

It's not common for me to add an app that I'll actually use daily or even weekly. It's also rare to see so many App Store reviews actually being lyrical.<p>Some (UI/UX) thoughts for you Bradford:<p>- Someone said that Flipboard looks better, I disagree. Flipboard (as well as Summly and others) might be a bit more ""sexy"" but Prismatic has better functionality + algorithm. Your funnel is really great.<p>- The flashing Facebook/Twitter/Google buttons are really annoying. It also makes me think that I'm accidentally hovering these buttons. Does this dramatically increase conversion?<p>- Someone mentioned here that your growth is not great (25K weekly). Do you think that only traditional sharing options will be enough to achieve growth corresponding to the goals this Series A indicates? I'm also thinking that maybe it would be smarter to focus on only one platform (i.e Facebook only) until you've figured out how to grow virally.<p>- The iPhone experience was much better than the desktop one. This may be because:<p>1. Your visual design is very different on desktop compared to iPhone. It's impossible to tell that it's the same service.<p>2. The desktop layout is confusing:<p>- The images are unnecessarily large (at least the really large ones)<p>- There's something about the font that's not great (take a look at Scala that the Stockholm/Berlin based Readmill is using)<p>- Seeing zero stars and comments on almost each article is a bit boring, it's not clear where the ""home"" button is (since it's located to the right)<p>- I can't see why there's such a distinction between ""home"" and ""world news"" - why not just get rid of ""world news"" and have a much more logical right menu<p>- ""Your suggestions"" in the right menu are great but it doesn't make sense to scroll horizontally.<p>Etc etc. (Should probably write you an email with screenshots + arrows instead...)<p>- The iPhone UI/UX has some flaws as well IMO. The menu is not always logical:<p>1. Since you've selected lots of topics in the funnel in order to add them to your affinity algorithm it's confusing that touching the suggestions in the menu takes me to a separate page instead of adding them. To add them, I apparently need to click the plus icon to the right. I'd suggest you to add an arrow to the left of each suggestion to solve this issue.<p>2. There's not a clear way to my ""home"" screen. ""Home"" is located under ""Your activity"" (why?!) and has some sub-categories; I'm still not sure why (in my case) Programming, Startups and The New York Times are located below the home-button.<p>3. The headlines are not too pretty (too bold/too big) and ""Search"" is slightly less bold which is not too nice (but obviously these are just details).<p>Well, thanks a lot for building a great service. :)<p>EDIT: Just saw that your designer Mikael is also a ~22yo designer from Stockholm, no wonder I'm a fan.",1354742141

User X (a non-technical) posts an idea that gets a little traction, but not enough for them to feel confident enough to build it out, especially when it means finding a team to do so.<p>2. Named Techie sees the project, likes the premise a lot, and knows User X doesn't have the resources.<p>3. Named Techie's friends post their concept with beautiful mockups and a more defined description and Named Techie highlights the project and it hits the front page -or- Named Techie's friends just launch the site without needing the validation, and through their network are able to have a fairly successful launch.<p>4. User X sees this, rages all across the internet, and you get bad press (and more trolls to boot).<p>In the event that Named Techie has the advantage of seeing all of these new concepts coming in and the public only sees them once they're approved by him, that's going to spawn some conflict of interests.<p>Even if all entries are public, you'll run into what we see on Show HNs.. like the one for 2u.fm yesterday where some idiot thought it would be a good idea to reply to as many people as possible who liked the concept to tell them that it was a complete ripoff of some other site (which it wasn't) or all of the people that constantly hate on the fact that someone would even think their project was a good idea.<p>Additionally, most of the concepts on the site aren't going to be exclusive to the person that's posting them, and having to deal with trolls or 'ownership' wars isn't something I'd want to bother with. Trying to fight this by only allowing members with some form of 'clout' to comment creates the issue I have with Kickstarter, where until you've put money into the project, you can't ask a question about it publicly.<p>I'm also concerned that too many people will place too much weight on the feedback they receive. The idea may very well be game-changing, but there's no way to know unless it's fully fleshed-out. Knowing how people react to having their dreams shattered, I just don't think this site is a good idea.

4878564,comment,4874304,4878064,1,0,mrb,,,"Yes there is a workaround: use the vmalloc=xxx parameter to increase it to a value greater than 128MB. This will work in most cases where the reserved virtual space can almost always at least be increased up to 256MB. I had to use this parameter myself 7 years ago when I was running 50-100 QEMU VMs on a 32-bit host with 32GB RAM and PAE.<p>The only cases where vmalloc=xxx won't solve your virtual address space is in exceedingly rare software/hardware configuration (more than 100+ QEMU VMs, more than probably about 4 Nvidia GPUs since they seem to use ~64MB each).<p>So all in all, yes for 99%+ of users not running these rare configs, the 3GB/1GB split is just fine. Which is why Linux never changed this default. Microsoft has more problem with a 3GB/1GB split because their kernel is less space-optimized (mostly due to bad coding practices because too many Windows drivers/kernel developers assume that 2GB is available.) I maintain my opinion that 3GB/1GB is a better tradeoff.",1354741356

Multiply the amount of energy needed per bit flip and the result implies there are never likley to be enough power plants on Earth to iterate through all the combinations (let alone perform the computations required to test the candidate key).<p>Hope this helps, perhaps this is enough for you to find the original reference.<p>Edit: perhaps it was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle</a> as mentioned below.",1354741270

Given that the ultimate point of writing the essay was surely <i>to get Congress to change it</i>, I find your objection puzzlingly off target, to the point of derailing the discussion.<p>If there is to be a FISA court at all that we citizens can have any confidence in, the way that that court is constituted needs to be changed.  That&#x27;s <i>my</i> takeaway from Klein&#x27;s column, and I think that&#x27;s what we ought to be discussing.<p>To that end, here&#x27;s a proposal.  Instead of the Chief Justice handling all the FISC appointments, set up a rotating schedule whereby each Supreme Court Justice gets one pick, in turn, as the existing terms expire.  That would bring at least a bit of ideological diversity.<p>Other possibilities can certainly be imagined.  Congress could have a more direct role, for example, but given the current gridlock around judicial appointments, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good idea.<p>Of course, the question of whether there should be a FISA court at all can also be debated.

5997098,comment,5996887,5996887,5,0,patio11,,,"I regret that I cannot answer this question in the way you have phrased it, because you can&#x27;t just check a box and say that a cloud host is suddenly HIPAA compliant or not.  There are various procedural safeguards which you&#x27;ll need, the absence of which will make any technical safeguards irrelevant from a compliance perspective.  For example, one of the requirements is that you have a nominated HIPAA officer, another is that you have a written policy to discipline employees who abuse patient health information.  You need both of these things regardless of whether your host makes certain aspects of compliance with the Security Rule easier.<p>About those things: HIPAA was apparently drafted by Congressional aides, not by technologists, so the Security Rule establishes a bunch of checkboxes which have eff all relevance to my main concerns as a systems engineer about application security.<p>For example, HIPAA and the assorted guidance is, as far as I know, totally silent on what this:<p><i>Do you have procedures for creating, changing, and safeguarding passwords?</i><p>actually means when the bcrypt hits the road.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that &quot;Yes, we do.  We enforce 8 character maximum passwords, they have to be changed every 3 weeks and 1 day except when the anniversary date falls on a Tuesday, and they are secured in our database by ROT13, an advanced encryption technology.&quot; is facially compliant as long as you have written it down somewhere.  There is very little in terms of either best practices or safe harbors.<p>This is a long way to say that you probably can&#x27;t take an application and HIPAA-ify it by writing a check to a hosting provider.<p>Given that you have the procedural and technical safeguards in place, I&#x27;m personally of the opinion (and feel free to check with your lawyer) that the right words, procedures, and application-level security features make it possible to host HIPAA-compliant applications on most common cloud providers.<p>I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, yadda yadda.",1373064742

I think there are two interesting sections that most people may not have thought of/considered: THE POWER OF PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS & THE DISTORTION OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS<p>e.g.<p>Correction officers unions are powerful forces in states like California and New York; they push for the construction of more prisons and for longer sentences for criminals (so that there are more people for correction officers to guard). Their activities in California are a case in point. In the last eight years they have spent $10 million on state politics  either in direct contributions to politicians or in spending on ballot initiatives relating to crime and punishment. They have mounted full-scale political campaigns. For instance, the California corrections union has attacked public officials, such as the Los Angeles district attorney, who supported an alternative to the union-favored three-strikes law. Indeed, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in February of this year noted that the three-strikes law sponsor is the correctional officers union and that is sick!

Since Dropbox doesnt verify email addresses when users sign up for a new account, a hacker can use a new email address thats similar to an existing one by placing a period in somewhere, similar to how Gmail addresses work.<p>For this fake account, two-factor authentication is enabled and an emergency code is generated in case users ever lose their phone. The hacker will then login to the victims account, but will be prompted to enter the code for that account. However, the hacker will simply select that the victim lost their phone and theyll be promoted for that emergency code.<p>Since the email address that the hacker signed up with is similar to the victims email address. the emergency code will work on the victims account. From there, the hacker can disable two-factor authentication and gain access into the victims Dropbox account. This is because that baseballboy@yahoo.com is registered as being the same baseball.boy@yahoo.com, just like how Gmail handles email addresses.<p>Of course, you have to know the users password before you can do this, but once you get a hold of it, it seems relatively easy to bypass Dropboxs two-factor authentication.

But heay, never mind all those numerous connections to ad servers to retrieve marketing garbage (i.e. not the content you are after), lets concentrate on compressing HTTP headers instead.  Brilliant.<p>It&#x27;s trivial to use pipelining: 1.

And to get confidence about lack of NPEs you want to have coverage of all lines involving dereferences, which means you need near 100% test coverage to have a reasonable level of confidence.<p>This is not true. In the example I spoke about above, if I take a CacheClient, and a ServiceXClient when my type is being constructed, assign them to local fields and then never modify that field again, then I don&#x27;t need to exercise every dereference of these fields, just one. And again, I don&#x27;t test that my code handles NPEs, I test that my code does what it is supposed to, and in the process of doing that, NPEs get flushed out.<p>> Generally types are far more concise and guarantee more than tests. I find 5 lines of types more readable than dozens or hundreds of lines of tests.<p>I think you are viewing this through red-black-tree colored glasses. Specifically, you believe that a lot of code has mathematical constraints the way that example did. To me, this is an extremely remote possibility.

And Go lacks all of these.<p>Truly, it baffles me that people still harp on the reliability aspect. It is quite likely that every piece of software you use day-to-day is written in a language with nullability, without pattern matching, and no sum types. Most of that software probably doesn&#x27;t even have memory-safety (gasp!). Probably every website you visit is in the same sorry state.

None of its singles broke into the top 100 on the singles charts, either. But still it was not <i>that</i> surprising when 1994&#x27;s <i>Downward Spiral</i> debuted at #2 on the charts, because by 1994 NIN had built up so many fans that there was a ton of anticipation.

First, hospitals typically don&#x27;t have the doctors directly on staff so they have visibility but relatively little leverage.  They provide an army of nurses but the doctors are independent contractors.  Second, you need scale to make it work.

Medicare for All.<p>Health Insurance is not, and has never been, a real market with normal economic behavior.  Imagine if car insurance that let you drive like an maniac but only based your premium of age of the car, then if you had an accident, it would spend unlimited amounts of money to fix your existing car.  And after your car is ten years old, the government takes over.  That&#x27;s our health care system.<p>A rational system would accept that everyone dies, share the risk of rare accidents across a large pool of people, and spend a lot of money earlier in peoples lives rather than waiting until they get to the emergency room.<p>I&#x27;m a capitalist to the core but it just doesn&#x27;t work with you don&#x27;t have a free market with a normal price-elasticity curve.",1373062534

Mind not blown, Mr. Un-PC Dude.<p>Second, that shows a fair degree of missing the point of <i>fiction</i>. Sure, in real life, where everything happens according to cold statistics, promiscuous women will tend to get more AIDS than non-promiscuous women and non-promiscuous heterosexual men. Granted.<p>But this is fiction, a work of art which has an <i>audience</i> and a <i>message</i>, where everything happens <i>because the author wants to</i>. Even if you don&#x27;t want to, even if you&#x27;re scared shitless of communicating a Message, you are in fact, as an author, putting a point across. It might not be a message that you as an author subscribe to, but the work is there, and the point is made; and you&#x27;re just a bad author. And people are naturally adept at finding the core message of works of fiction; we as a species seem to like narrative a lot.<p>We look at those Nazis melting at the end of the first Indiana Jones movie, and we instinctively get it: they were punished because of their arrogance and evilness (in this case Naziness). Even one Nazi got stigmata, as a symbolical punishment and marker of his inherent badness, that is, Naziness. It&#x27;s all narrative, and a message gets made, namely that being Nazi is kind of a bad deal. Take Elon Musk, he&#x27;s the hero in a narrative that pits the Startupy Original Innovators (good) against Sclerotic Big Corporations like Boeing (bad); and it&#x27;s hinted that badness will be punished at the end and good will prevail, as it is defined in the (narrow, a bit unfair) context of that narrative. A very common and crude narrative structure; and very powerful, by the way.<p>So, this guy watches Forrest Gump in a culture that tends to shame women that have casual sex, and sees that it <i>just so happens</i> a woman that has casual sex then has (is punished with, the mind readily answers, since it&#x27;s just too much of a coincidence...) AIDS, <i>because this author just decided for it to happen</i>. And this guy then infers the writer has made a moralizing tale where sluts get AIDS. Now, maybe this author was just clueless and didn&#x27;t think through the implications of his, or her, decisions; but I wouldn&#x27;t blame the GP for looking at Forrest Gump that way.",1373062211

However, I&#x27;m also coming from the position of hearing Greenwald describe an imminent set of leaks that describe the wholesale collection of phone conversation <i>contents</i> [1] (not just metadata) which IMO changes things drastically. You have to be reading from a dictionary of antonyms to find that under the definition of <i>reasonable</i>.<p>I would personally be fine with just having more transparency and using warrants issued by real (not secret) courts, even if we keep some of the technologies themselves, since I&#x27;m sure they are powerful tools to protect against the real threat of terrorism. But yes, when I consider the millions of lives that have been given to accomplish and defend the set of protections we have as Americans, I do mean it when I say that those who prefer security to freedom should consider finding a different country in which to live, even if it&#x27;s not logistically feasible to do so. That&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m personally an idealistic, rather than pragmatic, person.<p>I also apologize for getting overly political in this thread.

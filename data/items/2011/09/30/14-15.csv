3057239,comment,3056952,3057059,1,0,cainetighe,,,"I would say that it's mostly based on the culture you cultivate for your brand and yourself. In Gabe's post he mentioned Initech, the company from the movie Office Space, because it represents the quintessentially shitty corporately inundated fortune 50 company. Consequently, when I think of FOSS programmers, their job is either to work on this FOSS project (hired by yahoo to work on freebsd), or they're unfulfilled by their current job and use FOSS as a way to be creative and enjoy their craft. Prolific people are driven by obsession (my opinion); so even if they use that to make ends meat, it's not the end of the line for their work.",1317394781

3057201,comment,3056457,3056917,14,0,acqq,,,"I've actually tested this, so I have the exact answers! The author just saw the estimate of 1; he hasn't measured it, it seems. The estimation by Windows Explorer was wrong in my test but the actual difference wasn't so significant.<p>In my tests, the time of ""a lot of small files"" is dominated by the USB stick slowness (800 files totaling 5 M took 80 sec from the HDD and 90 sec from the network share), and the time of ""copying a big file"" gets two times slower when the sizes of write blocks to USB stick are not ""convenient"" and that happens in the ""network to USB"" case (130 MB for 7 sec from HDD, 14 sec from the network share).<p>Note that Windows by default doesn't cache writes to the USB stick; specifically, the scenario ""plug out the stick without unmounting"" is supported, whereas the last time I've checked I had to unmount USB sticks on Linux to be sure that everything is properly written.<p>So once you don't cache writes you're at mercy of the USB stick, which is reasonably fast only for one specific block size (specific multiple, actually). When you don't get the best block size over the network, you'll get slower writes to the USB stick.<p>What I see in my tests (on Windows XP) is that the copying is done by CopyFileEx API, which uses blocks of 65536 bytes (64KB) from the local HDD but uses blocks of 61440 bytes (that's exactly one 4K block less than 64KB) over the network, which is then slower on the USB stick.<p>Conclusions:<p>a) Don't copy small files to the USB stick on Windows if you need speed. It's hundreds of times faster (when the bytes are counted) to copy an archive of the files vs. a file by file.<p>b) If you want efficient copying of bigger files from the network share to the USB stick, avoid CopyFileEx API function, at least on Windows XP, use the software which writes in 32K multiples.",1317394079

Even if it is a couple bucks. They will already be inclined to pay for the full year because it isn't that expensive and $2.40 is a hassle to pay every month.

The read must involve some locking in case someone else tries to write to the file in between, and probably a ton of other stuff.

It's just part of the ""know your customer"" anti-money-laundering deal that all western countries have between their governments and their banks that make it difficult to set up abroad. It might be possible, but it's just extra headache.<p>I would suggest looking at Recurly as your integration endpoint for a few reasons:<p>1) Multi-currency. Some people claim it's ""expensive"" as as $200/mo add-on, but the extra conversions from geo-targetting visitors with their native currency make this a no-brainer, especially for UK companies.<p>2) Data portability. You can leave Recurly in 5 years if you want to write your own recurring billing app or switch to somewhere else and they will give you your data.<p>3) Not having your customer's CC details held at the gateway (Recurly are best described as a value-add intermediary) means you should be able to easily switch out gateways later on. This is a key architectural choice that I don't think people pay enough attention to, and Recurly really don't promote it enough. Chargify etc do not do this, instead they store your customer's details at the gateway and have no power to retrieve them ever again.<p>4) Supports VAT.<p>The down side to Recurly is their API is a bit messy. Their hosted payment pages and ""transparent API"" appear to be next to useless if you want to also record extra information (e.g, username) as part of the signup process in a seemless way.<p>With regards to payment gateway, pick any payment gateway from here: <a href=""http://recurly.com/features/payment-gateway-support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://recurly.com/features/payment-gateway-support</a><p>The truth is, it really doesn't matter. As long as it is working, and your bank/merchant account doesn't put a hold or delay on your income.<p>Don't stress about the transaction fees. People get too hung up on a percentage point, with the frame of reference that ""when we've got $10m in revenue, that 1% is worth $100,000)"", but honestly, when you get to that point, you will have enough business savvy to re-negotiate or look for a better deal then.

A ""100%"" demand in a smaller project for a typical small-to-medium business will likely mean something different than ""100%"" in a project for the NYSE. So, talk to the customer and find out what it is actually all about and then plan and quote according to their actual needs. So, this makes it more a requirements-engineering type of problem, not necessarily a hacker problem.<p>Or you just say ""yes, of course"" and tell them how super reliable the system is and then let the guys in legal work it out in the fine print and cover your ass.. but don't expect much happiness and continued business from that client then once they find out what's going on.<p>But, in a more honest approach, maybe this is actually all they really want and need?

Everyone has ideas, and some of these ideas are good, despite them coming from unknown people. Steve Jobs still had a knack for design and business savvy before founding Apple, right?

A lot of partners are now using services like Blip.tv and Revision3 alongside Youtube. Other's sell products, do advertising and other things on the side, all because they are popular on Youtube, but not related to their viewcount (Rhett & Link is a good example, they now have a successful TV show). Some have lower CPC/CPV values due to their audience and content. Some don't even use adds. This report was put together under the logic of ""The average CPV is $0.001 so every 1k views = $1"", rather than doing any actual research",1317391574

Twisted has been using it since the late 90's.  So JS doesn't have a standard library? Who cares? You still have to write one for your event-loop, which is what you had to do in Twisted.  I don't see any rethinking going on, I see steps backwards.",1317391538

I can't find the exact terms, and they potentially vary per-operator, but it's around 50% refund for up to 30 minutes delay, and a full ticket cost refund if it's >60 minutes.

3057024,comment,3055731,3056939,2,0,Alex3917,,,"There are a lot of different terms that researchers in the field use: psychedelic (mind manifesting), hallucinogen, psychotomimetic (psychosis mimicking), and entheogen (god manifesting) are the main ones. Normally which one you use depends on:<p>- who you're writing for\n- what aspect of the drug experience you're trying to emphasize<p>In Griffith's study he uses the term hallucinogen, most likely just to expedite IRB/FDA/DEA approval. In general though the preferred term seems to be entheogen now at least for conversational purposes, because people find it less objectionable than hallucinogen or psychedelic for obvious reasons, and it also tends to be a good conversation starter for people who haven't heard the term before. The downside is that while most atheists seem not to be bothered by the term, a few are. And it's not always appropriate, e.g. it wouldn't make sense when dosing rats with LSD or whatever.",1317391516

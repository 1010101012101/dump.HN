I'd love to be able to say that I've build something that generates even a hundred dollars a month. I find though that I fall victim to getting excited about an idea, starting down the path of building said idea, finding a reason to give up and then quitting. Sound familiar to anyone else?<p>Obviously the idea thing isn't working out. What I need to do is find actual problems to solve.<p>Here are a few questions.<p>1) How do you find problems to work on? I've been browsing forums of potential audiences but they all seem to have solutions already.<p>2) I've been mostly focusing on building some kind of software product. Maybe that's too much of a step from nothing?<p>3) Any advice, motivation or what ever you have?

Countries like Malaysia have a managed-floating currency based largely on the value of the RMB to make sure that they can compete effectively with China on a day-to-day basis when dealing in foreign exchange. I believe this is part of the reason analysts tend to give the RMB too much credit, once China grows to the point of higher internal consumption and less export dependency we will see many Asian currencies reforumlate their floats to reduce the emphasis on China.",1351191495

If you gave me google today, I'd be pondering how to turn that into a hundred googles, not relaxing on my private island beach. And I would only make those hundred googles in order to afford much more expensive stuff, such as an orbital elevator and much much more.\nAnd I would spend a few billions right ahead on education and fusion, since both of those have major ROI anyway.<p>2) nobody cares about education. with dumber people it's hard to achieve bigger results.\nAnd yes, since the loss of the soviet moscow university and the decline of european education, there are no more good schools in the world (the US never counted since it merely drained and never trained, Apollo is just one of the examples) and the only bit of hope comes from self-teaching.<p>But don't worry, I think the chinese have plans for education, and space, and quite soon I expect Athem to buy fusion for themselves since all the other countries don't care.",1351189730

Burned entirely too much time assuming that documented ways to handle things were actually rock solid, not rarely used.  The first bug where 3 connections could deadlock everything was unrelated to threading.  It was related to how it created identifiers for each connection and would create identical identifiers for two different connections so it would think there was data pending for a socket, but the data had already been read, so it tried to do a blocking read when there wasn't data to read.  I never fully tracked down the second bug, but it was more likely related to using threading.<p>One thing we did have was a large majority of the connections were coming from the same IP (but different source port) and a peak connection rate of ~200 connections per second per server and would last a few seconds (so at any given moment, roughly 1000 connections being established or with data in flight).

People using cheats and hacks in multi-player games is another strong case for keeping consoles locked down.  More and more I'm questioning the methods they use to do so though. The constant firmware/system software updates that they roll out are incredibly obtrusive. Prior to this generation of consoles one of the things that really made console gaming superior to PC gaming was the ease of use.  Buy game. Stick game into console. Play game.<p>Now you buy the game, download it (and wait) or stick it in, install whatever stupid update is required for the game (and wait), restart your stupid console (and wait), install the game (and wait, or don't install it and suffer awful load times), and then after all that maybe you get to play the thing. Meanwhile, PC gaming is way ahead of the curve in this new paradigm in almost every respect. Yes, you often have to download the game, but you can also start installing and playing before it's finished downloading (Diablo 2 let you do this, I'm not sure how common that is), and you don't have to restart your computer due to some stupid firmware update (that is really just there to prevent piracy).",1351189174

The lobes are large enough that the connecting material to the main shaft of the tool will provide a desired level of strength.  In fact, I would bet that the lobe connecting material thickness was specifically designed to exceed the required torque rating of the screw.*  A square receptacle would not be sufficient, as the 90' edges of the tool would quickly wear down, the tool has to present all round surfaces for this to work.<p>2: By using a driver with no sharp surfaces, and made of a material softer than the enclosure of the device, they reduce the number of scratches made in the surface of the enclosure by workers who will, and I promise you this, miss the screw quite regularly if they don't get it properly torqued before removing the tool.<p>As the device enclosures are often one-piece, milled and surfaced aluminum, the custom tool and screws would likely have less overall cost than a common miss-rate or miss-error level with a metal tool.<p>I would also posit why so many are having difficulty manufacturing the tool, is because they're trying to make them out of metal.<p>If the above happens to be true, I would think the choice of screw design is an act of manufacturing efficiency genius.<p>* - Having had the misfortune of using plastic versions of all of torx, flat, and phillips head screw-drivers, yes, I can say they don't last long.",1351189143

I'm not a fan of regulation on the internet, but there's some regulations i'd really like to see for the purpose of creating a more competitive atmosphere.  They're probably too extreme today, but in the future I can see them being necessary as our lives increasingly become more digital.<p>One of them is that all data I create, which is stored, I should have access to, programmatically preferably.  If I sign up for a site like Facebook, and create data such as friend connections I should have direct access to that data.  Without access, there's an anti-competitive atmosphere.  It is near impossible for me to create a new social network today on a similar scale to Facebook, because people's data is locked up.  Even Google+ with google's resources, and popularity couldn't get people to detach from Facebook.  I watched as people enthusiastically went to Google+, but then left as they found everything they wanted to do with it was locked up elsewhere.  It is true that Facebook has this data available on their API, however it also has the ability to choose who can use it.  That's the problem.  I feel this data should be available for the express purpose of allowing competition to flourish.<p>of course there's other examples.  Linked in has almost exclusive access to my resume + business contacts.  Gmail has my life's history.  Literally.  I probably talk to my girlfriend on gchat more than when we're home.  By the time we get home, there's nothing new :D  Almost every big decision we've made has been while chatting at work.  I can go back, and look at the record of our conversation I had when we came up with the name for my dog.  Or when we decided to move to a different state, or when I told her my mom was hit by a car.  No one company should be able to wipe out my life's memories.  No one company should have exclusive access to this data.  It is MY DATA (i realize the law doesn't recognize this as true yet, but it will).<p>Every day as we move to digital lives, the services we use go from being fun things we do, to critical infrastructure.  Those gchat logs are really important to me.  Those facebook status conversations are important to me.  I didn't choose facebook based on their features.  It kind of just happened.  But now its a part of my life (a lot of our lives).  I want control over it.",1351188381

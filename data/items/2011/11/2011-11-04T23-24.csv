All nuclear reactions be they fission or fusion release their energy as radiation either high energy photons or chunks of matter being blown from the nucleus at high energy levels.  So, I really don't think the details of what was actually said are being summarized vary well.<p>EX: D+T fusion = 2 protons + 3 neutrons one of which does not get to stick around and 17.59 MeV worth of energy.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deuterium-tritium_fusion.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deuterium-tritium_fusion.s...</a>  (The diffrence in energy comes from the conservation of momentum. ~1/4th the mass needs to go ~4x as fast to have the same momentum which takes ~4x the energy {e=v^2 x m=(4)^2 x (1/4)=4}.)",1320451195

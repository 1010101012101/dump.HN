290535,comment,290332,290467,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I talked about this with a Swedish coworker a couple months ago. I'm trying to leave the details vague where I don't remember them (long conversation, this was a small part of it), so please correct me if I'm wrong.<p>He said that the population distribution in Sweden is vastly more favorable for setting up networking infrastructure than in the US (more urbanized), and that, several years ago, when the government was digging up cables for some other utility infrastructure (power lines?), they decided it was a good idea to also lay inexpensive optical fiber while the holes were already dug.<p>Such an initiative would almost certainly be politically infeasible in the US, except at a local level. Tax dollars, you know. It's probably somewhat comparable to public transit systems. Subways systems take a lot of work upfront, so many cities only have buses, if anything. City wi-fi initiatives have had rather mixed results, too, and those don't even involve digging to lay cables.",1220051363
290534,comment,290216,290216,0,0,cwp,,,"I had lasik about 5 years ago and I can't say enough good things about it. I did a bit of research and found a surgeon in Vancouver, BC who had done a lot of surgeries and some original research on eye surgery. It cost about $3000 for both eyes, which I consider a steal.<p>The procedure its self was quick and painless. There was a contraption for ""peeling"" the outer surface off the eye which was a little freaky, but tolerable if I didn't think about it too much. Then they did the laser part of it, using lots of little blasts to reshape my cornea. That part was actually pretty cool, like watching blurry fireworks that filled my field of vision. Then they put back the corneal flaps and sent me off to a dark room to rest for a bit. Twenty minutes later I was on the sidewalk gawking at everyone and everything.<p>At first my vision was sharp but distorted, but that cleared up within a day. After that I had better than 20/20 vision. I had a bit of discomfort in the days following the surgery, but the clinic had given me some eyedrops that took care of that handily. After that everything felt fine, and there was a longer period of healing where I had to be careful about rubbing my eyes and wear special eye guards at night.<p>Before the surgery I had been using a combination of glasses (most of the time) and contacts (for sports). Now I don't need either, and a real blessing. I do moderate amounts of outdoor sports, and things like skiing, mountain biking, camping, rafting and do on are so much better now that I don't have to worry about keeping contacts clean, switching between glasses and contacts, protecting my face from water etc.<p>I tend to wake up with dry eyes and usually put in some artificial tears when I get out of bed. If I can't for some reason, it's no problem, my natural tears start flowing after a few minutes. I haven't had any problems with dryness during the day. My night vision is ok. Really bright lights tend to have a very slight starburst effect, in low-light situations I see quite well. I can see the stars much better than I could before the surgery.<p>My doctor says I'll need reading glasses when I get older, which I wouldn't have without the surgery. I don't care. I've got maybe 20 years of perfect vision, and even then, being farsighted is better than being nearsighted. I'd rather wear glasses when sitting in front of a computer than when skiing.<p>All in all, it's the best decision I ever made.",1220051313
290533,comment,290216,290216,0,0,spacecowboy,,,"I do software development for a living and about 5 years ago, I had lasik so that I could get rid of wearing glasses.  Although my vision went to 20/15 after the surgery and although I did my homework, went with a name brand surgeon in my state but according to my surgeon, I happen to had fallen into the 1% category that reports 20/20 vision or better but I see artifacts in my vision.  I don't see halos or blurriness, instead, it looks like I'm seeing artifacts that are highlighted by light.  My theory is that I've seeing scarring from the procedure.  The artifacts are really close looking like floaties but I know what floaties look like and these aren't them.  Whenever my focus changes from looking at objects from up close to far away or vice-versa, these artifacts move with my vision and come into my vision from the sides. So the times that it really affects me is when my vision is tired like when I stay up late at night, have a headache or when I'm sitting in a dark room looking out a window to a sunny day out.  Overall, I'm ok with having lasik, but there are those days when my vision is really bothering me that I somewhat regret having it done.  I wish everyone the best in your decision to either have it done or not.  Cheers.",1220051306

If they don't get a ticket they can organise their week around other events e.g. work at coworking spaces, attend tech events, meet friends, some sight-seeing etc.<p>Companies could arrange a similar schedule for their employees.  Just being in San Francisco to network and meet potential partners and clients is as valuable as attending I/O sessions.<p>An added bonus of knowing the dates early is that you can now plan your family vacation or company off-site without worrying about potentially missing out on a tech conference.",1354661955
4873814,comment,4872595,4873634,3,0,jcomis,,,"It sounds like you are wanting to use some classes (like btn-group) as mixins, when this would not be a good practice, even if it worked the way you are attempting. You don't want to compile the btn-group less to css in every instance of it's usage, it would be repetitive. That's why it's a class rather than a mixin. I see mixins mainly as timesavers to simplify stuff which requires browser prefixes or can be reused through variables. So I wouldn't want to drop .btn-group into a customized class I'm writing, I'd just include it in <ul class=""btn-group custom-class"">.<p>I might be misunderstanding you, and I might just be wrong (I am not a less expert).",1354661950

I can understand why Netflix would want it, but this means that Netflix has to pay a ton more money, thus limiting their ability to get more of these deals.  As a Netflix subscriber, I'd rather see them signing more non-exclusive deals than fewer exclusive deals.<p>For Disney, it seems a ridiculous move -- why not offer multiple channels?

Due to this, testimonials with pictures of real people have the most impact in the decision making process - especially if (i) the SAAS website is relatively unknown and (ii) its a SAAS for consumers (i.e. customers are consumers and not businesses).",1354660842

I keep seeing LESS/SASS referenced as important tools in achieving this all tersely; and I would rather not have to dig into custom styling and design until after I've got a broader picture, and also have a vague notion that it handles cross-browser inconsistencies for you, so I'm trying to use Bootstrap.  Using them together has been an ungodly massive pain, and most components aren't working at all.<p>Am I having a fundamental misunderstanding of these concepts, or is it just totally not usable in the way I've been struggling to use it?<p>Basic things like `.btn-group`, and `.input-prepend`, do not work when applied with LESS.  Many components, documented in the official Bootstrap docs, and properly exposed in the compiled CSS, either aren't in scope or are not fully applied, when mixed in.  Styles will apply properly when put in `<ul class="".btn-group"">`, but that's what I thought LESS was supposed to help you get away from.  `.container` works with `Bootstrap-SASS`[0], but not with the LESS from the official repo[1].  A massive and unpredictable amount of Bootstrap seems to just not be exposed when importing the LESS source, and what is and isn't, and how to use what isn't, doesn't seem to be documented anywhere.  The handful of stackoverflow answers on the topic only ever reference `.makeRow` and `.makeColumn(n)`, with no acknowledgement of the wider issue.<p>It's wasted hours and hours of my time, trying to figure this all out.  It's infuriating.<p>Would I have a better experience with Zurb Foundation, or some other framework?

But it is incredibly dangerous when what you're selling may have no value at all. This guy is definitely too early in the process to be testing the hypothesis, ""Hey, maybe I'm just not enough of a dramatic stalker."" And if he did want to test that he shouldn't start by doing it with such a high-value target.",1354658471

At a storage capacity of 5 kWh and a lifespan in service of approx. 360 days, we can guesstimate a daily power consumption of ~14 watt-hours.  If placed outdoors in the midwest, the solar panel would need to be about the size of a DVD.  There's often little in terms of light that hits a smoke detector but between natural and artificial light there's more hours of light hitting it.  I'd estimate a typical household could get by with something twice the size.<p>Dunno about you, but I think there's more to fear from a 9V battery than a solar panel that size, esp. with the whole thing comfortably sitting on the wall.",1354658412

In my opinion, Basecamp is excellent for working with multiple clients/stakeholders on small, self-contained projects.<p>For collaborating on projects with clients, 37S makes a product that has limitations but the overall user experience makes it better than their competitors.<p>LP and Wrike both share serious access/security flaws (LiquidPlanner grants global access to anyone who is shared a workspace (clients,projects,folders) and Wrike allows anyone who is shared a virtual project folder to go on and share it with anyone - (who can easily delete the entire virtual project folder and all its children). These open, Web 2.0 collaborative ideals don't work well with a company focused on multiple client projects (all of which must be confidential).",1242835188

The book is not supposed to be about a specific framework, but about ways to solve common problems. So the programming language should not get in the way of the concepts.<p>Example: ""Programming Collective Intelligence"" uses examples in Python to explain the data mining algorithm it presents.<p>I am almost tempted to pick JavaScript, as this is the common language every web developer should know anyway.<p>I would like to use Ruby+Rails, but I fear it might be too complicated to explain. I want to spend as little time as possible on framework specifics.<p>I was really impressed by the brevity of the Python examples in the Collective Intelligence book. Unfortunately I don't know Python yet.<p>The publisher who might be interested in publishing the book pointed to PHP as still being among the most popular languages for such tasks (along with Java), but I would like to avoid that.",1242834999

These will enable authors to produce more books.""<p>Really?  I read mostly science fiction and CS books.  I am not sure what these new genres are, but I dont find the idea compelling.  Lightweight books?  Half a century ago SF books were 120 to 150 pages long.  I like the current 300-400 page books better.  Lightweight technical?  If I want lightweight, I read blogs.  The fiction authors that I read produce 2 or 3 books per year.  Writing is hard work, and I dont see format changes changing that.  Authors need to make a living.  The generally poor quality of OSS documentation attests to that.<p>There is probably room to squeeze some fat out of $50-100 technical books.  Safari rents a selection of books for a reasonable amount per month, so that could be a good model.  And there are educators working on low cost/free textbooks.<p>I would hate to see well written books replaced by crowdsourcing.<p>ADDENDUM: There is a small but growing trend for authors to put out a free online version at the same time the book is published.  It seems to actually increase book sales.",1242834719

618732,comment,618216,618645,0,0,delano,,,"First of all, the article speaks of journalists as a homogenous group which is ridiculous since they are neither created equal nor do they act as a single group. It then describes only one aspect of journalism and devalues all roles journalists play based on that incomplete description. For example, there is no mention of the value of investigative journalism or the historical value of well-written, unbiased content.<p>From the article: <i>Today, ordinary adults can observe and report news, gather expert knowledge, determine significance, add audio, photography, and video components, and publish this content far and wide (or at least to their social network) with ease. And much of this is done for no pay.</i><p>This is a generally correct assessment of the current situation. Where it goes wrong is with the conclusion it draws: <i>""Until journalists can redefine the value of their labor above this level, they deserve low pay.""</i><p>As long as there are businesses willing to pay for this type of content, there will be people willing to fill those positions. It's not the responsibility of journalists to correct this situation.",1242834676
618731,comment,618461,618461,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>In 1901, the most acclaimed tennis player in the world was a man named William Larned.</i><p>An irrelevant example.  Why didn't the author choose an example from a sport where the poor and middle class had reasonable access to facilities and training?<p><i>Perhaps the transition was another result of the gradual democratization of our culture. With more and more people able to participate in games that had previously been available only to the leisure class, the one percent just couldnâ€™t compete.</i><p>This is a good guess, but here's another one:  Perhaps William Larned was able to devote his life to tennis because he took his place in the upper class for granted and didn't feel like he needed to prove his worthiness.  Perhaps the democratization of culture means that the rich now feel more pressure to prove or earn their right to be so privileged, so they put their energy into education and professional achievement.<p>Devoting oneself wholeheartedly to a sport means neglecting all the more reliable ways of maintaining one's status.  In days past, most people who inherited a place in the upper class didn't feel particularly pressed to maintain it or prove they deserved it.  They just assumed it was a fact of life.  Enterprise and noblesse oblige were only for those who felt inclined to them.  There was nothing to lose by devoting one's life to whatever one wanted, whether that was sport, adventure, or partying.",1242834668
618730,comment,618594,618594,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"This is such an uninformed argument, publishing has a narrow profit margin. These companies aren't trying to extort you at 2000% profit like other companies.<p>The entire publishing process is designed to filter out the chaff. First you need an agent (this is undeniable when some publishing houses won't accept a submission without one) whose job it is to first find publishers that are interested and then to make them pay every penny they're willing for it. When a first time author like Stephanie Mayer gets handed $750,000 for a series, that's because their agent just got handed 75,000-112,000. If you go it alone you'd probably get less than what your agent alone would get.<p>After the books in the publishing house, it is usually reviewed by like up to 5 editors who give their opinion before it's handed over to one editor who they believe is the best for it. You then get an editor, who through multiple revisions helps the author get the book to a better standard and quite often to more closely resemble the authors original idea.<p>I've worked with editors, and they're very passionate and put a lot of themselves into the work. This isn't something you're going to get at some slapped together organization. The argument that they're being replaced by digg (in the disaggregate link) is completely laughable, I'm sorry but digg and HN link mostly to articles at websites that all have editors. Just because people aren't committed to one information source and choose their own news (hence why some people get several news papers in the morning) doesn't mean the editors job is [gone].<p>Then he argues that it's help authors by allowing them to produce more books... Some authors release a book every few years and some release one nearly every 3 months (Stephen King). This isn't an efficiency model that can simply be stepped up by a new technology. It's an entirely ignorant argument.<p>This article is just plain bad. No one should sell their work at $9.99 a copy if it isn't going to cover the costs. In the publishing world especially, you should never release a copy for such a low price when the majority of books make most of their money in the first few months to a year when the book is priced the highest.<p>I hate these articles, because they're always written by people who are so uninformed on the issues. They're by people who assume the end is nigh for corporate publishing, despite the fact that there's been little to no effect on traditional publishing media, in fact global book sales have been on an increase over the past years.",1242834578

618725,comment,618216,618509,0,0,mblakele,,,"I suspect those lamentations are largely due to a combination of selective memory and the spirit of the times. Getting back to journalism as an example, there wasn't much investigative reporting in American journalism before the Watergate scandal toppled Nixon's administration. It existed, but that's about all: most American journalists weren't Tarbells, Sinlairs, or Naders.<p>Before Watergate made it fashionable, most investigative journalists had strong personal motivation for their work. They would have fit right into the last election cycle as bloggers. I suspect that's also true of Bernstein, but under today's conditions Woodward might have chosen law or business.<p>After Watergate, every journalism group seemed to jump into investigative journalism with both feet. Afterward it became apparent that this wasn't sustainable, and investigative journalism declined again. However, there will always be a certain number of motivated investigative journalists (or, if you like, muckrakers). With modern technology, they can publish their own work at a very low cost.",1242834449

So I'll just challenge that assumption ;-) By and large, I think you and the OP are defining inferior products as synonymous with less fully featured products. But it's not that simple (witness the iPhone, still lacking cut & paste).<p>For example, compare Highrise with Salesforce. My company (a 50 person consulting firm) is moving away from SF to HR right now, even though SF has many, many more features. Why? Because HR has all of the features we need, and most of the features we like (but don't absolutely require). And we are much, much more productive when using HR. It's easier to use. I don't have to think much when filling in information. The reports take me about 5 seconds to read and comprehend. This time savings is very valuable to me and my company - I've got better things to do than think about how to use a CRM application. The features Salesforce possesses that HR lacks, by contrast, don't have any value.<p>You'll get it if you just look at things through a slightly different lens. You might be getting tripped up by the confusion of effort and size with value. Value is what software has to a customer - effort is the cost software has to developers. And size is just a number.

C/C++ happens to be very high on the list. And learning more really doesn't hurt.<p>Not just C++, but also learn C, Java, Perl, Python, Erlang, Lisp, PHP, Shell Scripting, Assembly, Ruby, along with their most used libraries/frameworks. The more diversify your skillets, the better you can use the right tool for the moment, improving performance of that, lower development time. (Eg. A spoon can be used to build a house, but it's hardly the best tool out there).<p>This way, want to hack up a quick content management or low computational front end system, whip out your php/python/ruby with your favourite framework out. Got a bottleneck at high cpu or memory bound place, rewrite that piece in C/C++. Need to deploy a cross platform app really quickly, Java. Want to bind or write a test for a bunch of tools, use Python or Perl. The list goes on.<p>Summary: Learn More, use the right tool, do less, get more accomplished.",1242833014

The patterns mentioned above aren't about efficiency; they're about encapsulation.<p>Just to give an example -- in C++ if you want to set up a callback, for example with an observer pattern, you'd use a pure virtual function (and then pass in a concrete instance of that class) or a functor.  You can't do that in C, so you use a function pointer.  You learn to work with function pointers more because they're a necessary part of designing C APIs, whereas they're not in C++.<p>(Note that it's the language I'm best at, followed by C, so this isn't random C++ hating.)",1242831886

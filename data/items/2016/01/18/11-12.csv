In the space of about 3 hours, and as a wet-behind-the-ears 18 year old, I was rushed through ejection seat training, sea survival training, flight suit checks, oxygen mask fitting and the flight itself. I think I also had to be squeezed into an immersion suit - the flight was over the North Sea.<p>As we taxied out to take off, the prevailing wind and the geometry of the airfield meant that we had to pass the rest of my cadet group as they sat outside in the sun in deckchairs, watching flight operations. I gave them a confident thumbs-up and we were off.<p>It turned out that I would be the only one of us to get a ride in a Lightning during that summer camp (I&#x27;d won the draw that made me the first to go) - some combination of weather and aircraft availability.<p>Edit: typo",1453118080

This works by making the compiler add exception handler data to the executable file, ie. telling where the catch() blocks are. When an exception is thrown, the stack trace is analyzed and the appropriate catch handler is found by searching for the return addresses in the exception handler data.<p>This can make C++ with exceptions faster than C with error checks because there&#x27;s no branches to check for every error condition. Using __builtin_expect for marking the error conditions as unlikely may mitigate this issue.",1453117850

People for some reason forget that market does what market does - optimizes everything for profitability. It doesn&#x27;t stop at &quot;good enough&quot;. It pushes forward, destroying anything that is not helping the profit margin. Various organizational inefficiencies go first, but after that, the next thing to fly out of the window is product quality and working conditions.<p>In &quot;Meditations on Moloch&quot;[0], Scott Alexander did a pretty good work describing this mechanism, as well as various consequences it has. The general pattern is:<p>&quot;In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out. Eventually, everyone’s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone’s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.&quot;<p>[0] - <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/</a>",1453117665

Like full program reflection, fast debug builds, and fast (below 5s) builds.<p>Funny that you mention the decoupling of state and logic, because I see that as a non-issue in C.

MSVC doesn&#x27;t do this, but I don&#x27;t write code for MSVC any more because I can compile compatible object files with Clang.<p>In my experiments, I&#x27;ve noticed that you get the best performance by passing vectors and matrices by value, not by pointer or reference. It also makes the API nice, because you can return matrix values, e.g. `mat4x4f mvp = matrix_product(projection, matrix_product(model, view))`. In some nasty cases you might need to add force_inline attribute, but most of the time the compiler will inline the functions anyway.<p>In C++ with operator overloading it&#x27;s easy to do stupid things like in-place addition (e.g. operator+= for a vec4f) or start transposing matrices in place. This will make the compiler emit memory load/store instructions when you&#x27;d want to have these values in registers.<p>> being able to have generic containers with templates<p>Generic containers are somewhat of an issue with C, but most of the std::containers are not suitable for some game development tasks (this is why projects like eastl exists). I prefer using intrusive containers in C, similar to how the Linux kernel deals with linked lists and red-black trees. Even the C++ standard library (the GNU one) is internally implemented this way, the &quot;generic container&quot; is just a thin type safety shim on top to avoid template bloat.",1453117166

I got it working well so that a single lambda function can receive calls from multiple api paths (so we can deploy an entire API at once, and manage dependencies simply), and that all the environment configuration is in the api gateway, not lambda (so a single function can be invoked with production/staging/development environment parameters).<p>it took me a while to figure out exactly how to pass things up and down the stack, and we ended up building something similar to apex (but significantly simpler due to a limited use case). a single command-line request packs up everything, uploads lambda, creates and configures the API gateway functions, manages versions and permissions, so it&#x27;s relatively easy to create a new JS function tied to a URL in the API gateway now.

My view as a local startup founder is, it&#x27;s not as rosy as one would expect for a city of burgeoning startups:<p>- Singapore startups face the big difficult of a tiny domestic market (5m people) and a fragmented regional market (10+ different countries). To expand, you have to localise to multiple different languages and market environments. Entrepreneurs don&#x27;t have exposure to the problems & conditions of these foreign markets, making it harder to find scalable opportunities.<p>- Therefore, the ideas that stand a good chance of success are mass-market, possibly copycat ones, not technologically innovative ones like one would find in SF or Boston. We don&#x27;t have too many high-value niches here.<p>- The winning exceptions are startups that target a globally integrated market, e.g. gaming products (Razer) or web services (Zopim). If you can sell to the world (or very large markets) instead of struggling to penetrate many small markets, you&#x27;re golden. Israel has been a leader in this regard.<p>- There&#x27;s a lack of exits because most startups struggle to gain huge reach in such a fragmented region. Plus, monetisation can be a problem in the poorer countries.<p>- Angel investors are therefore more cautious and mostly take small or less risky bets. Which encourages entrepreneurs to focus on more mass-market, less innovative ideas. It&#x27;s hard to build a Google without a wide-ranging and risk-taking investor network as exists in Silicon Valley.<p>- The government&#x27;s general support for startups is a bright spot, but a startup&#x27;s success general depends on whether they manage to expand overseas and build their partner/investor network. Those are high barriers for most startups.<p>A small market can&#x27;t support that many competing ideas anyway, so as Dr Theseira says in the article, <i>“Entrepreneurs should make sure that they are valuing their own time appropriately when making the decision to become an entrepreneur or when they are considering whether to remain or exit from an industry.”</i>",1453116551

This was unfair as the project had only cost some £125 million up until cancellation, and had in fact, quite a slow rate of spend for a major weapon system of this type.<p>As for the rest, history is complex and high dimensional and there is rarely just one reason or easy explanation (for example, above link argues for a Labour vs Conservative political fight, rather than international relations and economic warfare motivations). You read a lot of sources (and I doubt the government-controlled BBC would ever criticize past government decisions or admit to US influence) and try and criss-cross a most likely opinion, and mine is that it was a political shot.<p>As with the Valkyrie, the roles of both nuclear delivery aircraft and the interceptors that would catch them were rapidly being retired by ICBMs, and of course Britain&#x27;s military might was less and less justified to the taxpayer as decolonisation and economic stagnation progressed, but there was still no justification for setting back the British R&D community by so much (by destroying all the TSR-2 related work, and burning the airframes). That work was relatively cutting edge ([1] claims it set the British back 8 years) and could have been used in a myriad of other projects, thus having relatively high value, even without the option to sell TSR-2s as a ROI.<p>To me, there is therefore the motive for economic warfare from the American side, especially considering the later purchase of F-111s by Australia when they had expressed their interest in the TSR-2 bringing back the short term international economic interest into the picture. The companies involved were clearly capable of doing this kind of thing - see General Dynamics&#x27; continuous fight against Admiral Rickover [2].<p>> in 1963, the RAAF chose to buy the F-111 instead, having been offered a better price and delivery schedule by the American manufacturer.[84][85] Nonetheless, the RAAF had to wait 10 years before the F-111 was ready to enter service, by which time the anticipated programme cost had tripled.<p>I am sure this particular tactic is familiar to many in the IT industry...<p>Why would they do it?<p>> Among the topics of discussion were the future of the TSR-2, Britain’s purchase of F-111s, and U.S. support for a desperately needed $8.4 billion loan to Britain from the International Monetary Fund.<p>> Although it has never been proved, some believe the TSR-2’s fate was sealed on that trip by an unofficial deal between Healey and U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara: Britain would cancel the TSR-2 and buy the F-111, McNamara’s pet fighter-for-all-reasons, in exchange for U.S. backing of the IMF loan.

So often narratives of great achievements are told/shown in such a way as though it were destiny, like those involved were geniuses who knew the right path all along. That&#x27;s not how real work -- of any kind, looks like. What a tremendous lesson for young people everywhere to see Musk share his work -- the successes and failures -- with the world.<p>I loved Gene Kranz&#x27;s &quot;Failure is not an option,&quot; but outside of the specific context in which it was used, it is a terrible slogan. Failure, actually, ought to be the only option, in the sense that if you are never failing you likely are falling short of whatever it is that you could potentially accomplish.<p>Nowadays there is this idea of instilling in kids a &quot;growth&quot; mindset, in the sense that you ought not praise them for &quot;intelligence&quot; or how smart they are, since these things are immutable. Rather, praising them for their effort and perseverance, which can be nurtured, likely helps instill in them these very values, which often are far better predictors of success than intelligence itself.<p>I hope at some point we collectively start thinking about great founders, or companies, or amazing things society builds in the same way. Instead of story after story praising Musk for being the &quot;real iron-man,&quot; maybe we should publicize the electric car movie where you see him walk into a garage in the middle of the night filled with cars with production issues, with a clear look of despair on his face. SpaceX is now the leader of private space aviation, but at one point Musk had to bank the company on a single launch because, well... all other ones had failed.<p>He is undoubtedly the innovator of our generation.

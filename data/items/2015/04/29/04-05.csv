And becuase of how bad the JVM is, substantially slower.<p>Look at JGit.<p>> int myInt = (myBoolean) ? 1 : 0;<p>Now try to do that throughout the code. Not to mention which, that&#x27;s a conditional branch for what should be (and is in bytecode) a no-op. (Well, assuming your bytecode is well-conditioned. But the JVM being the JVM, there&#x27;s no such thing as a boolean, which means you can have the &quot;boolean&quot; value 2, for instance, which seriously messes all sorts of things up.)<p>Sure, the JVM is supposed to optimize that out. But you can&#x27;t rely on it being able to do so. At least not if you&#x27;re not going to use a mainstream JVM.<p>And no, the JVM is not &quot;one of the best&quot; optimizing compilers around. It&#x27;s not even a <i>good</i> optimizing compiler. Nowhere near. For a quick counterexample, this: <a href=""https://github.com/RS485/LogisticsPipes/commit/bb8a57665c4f80a76fc1911d77ae39153783fdc3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/RS485/LogisticsPipes/commit/bb8a57665c4f8...</a><p>Halving the time taken. Why? Because the JVM wasn&#x27;t smart enough to realize that copying an EnumSet for a readonly foreach loop was unnecessary. Oh, and there&#x27;s more low-hanging fruit there w.r.t. the amount of work (read: reflection) EnumSet has to do behind the scenes to work around Java&#x27;s type system. Simple. But no, the Java compiler doesn&#x27;t optimize it out, and the JVM doesn&#x27;t either.<p>And that&#x27;s <i>with</i> adding an additional unnecessary layer of abstraction (unmodifiableSet) that you wouldn&#x27;t need if Java had a sane type system.<p>Copying an EnumSet of a small number of elements would be, in a sane language, quite literally just a register move. Ditto, containsAll a bitwise-not and a bitwise-and. But no, &quot;one of the best&quot; optimizing compilers around cannot even do that.<p>Trying to write high-performance code in Java generally requires tossing out all the supposed advantages of Java.

The button CE clears I to 0, and C clears R to 0. The display always shows the contents of the most recently modified accumulator. An &quot;operation&quot; register, O, contains the most recently pressed operation button and is initially the null operation. Inputting digits/decimal points modifies I.<p>Whenever +, -, <i>, / are entered, it performs R = R O I and then sets O to the new most recent operation. When &#x27;=&#x27; is pressed, R = R O I without changing the most recent operation. This is why sequences like 1+2+5</i>4= gives 32, and then &#x27;=&#x27; again will multiply 32 by 4, etc.<p>This type of calculator is easy to identify because it has no notion of operator precedence and always evaluates in the sequence it&#x27;s given, and furthermore doesn&#x27;t actually require an &#x27;=&#x27; key - observe that if e.g. you input 2+2-, 2+2+, 2+2/, or 2+2*, the display already shows 4 because entering the last op has caused the previous op + to be evaluated giving R += I, and the display shows the new value of R.<p>Those with a &quot;memory&quot; function add another accumulator, M. Then the operation MC is M=0, M+ performs M+=R or M+=I (depending on the currently displayed register), M- is M-=R or M-=I, and MR is I=M.",1430280618

1056965,comment,1056689,1056808,0,0,intellectronica,,,"No feminist would have ever written an article like this. It is strongly biased and doesn't support women's struggle to reach the same status men have in any serious way.<p>The problem (according to feminist doctrine, not sure I subscribe to it myself) is exactly that most of the people on top are men. Since the population is split 50-50% between men and women you should expect the same balance to exist at the top. In some very modern societies (Sweden, for example) this is, in fact, the case.<p>I'm not sure what it is you're tired of, exactly. Except for those few cases where the rights of men are compromised in the name of feminism, how could you sensibly object to a school of though that wants to gain equality for women?",1263653930

We couldn't even identify them based on IP address because of their regular-computer-using distributed system. If anything, 80Legs is the ultimate DDoS machine.<p>I mean, they state that their crawl average is 1 req/sec and can be modified if you contact them. The problem is that other people can modify the crawl rate (somebody set ours to 4/seq).<p>And remember, that's just the average. The distributed nature of their system means that it's ridiculously spikey. Furthermore they don't respect nofollow tags that we put in place to keep bots out of bad areas, so their crawlers got into very unoptimized areas of the site.<p>Overall though we turned it into a positive by ramping up our analysis tools, and creating a much stronger robots.txt. Still... I really don't like 80legs and bristle when people reference them as someone doing 'good'.",1263653740

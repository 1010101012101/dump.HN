Please guide this bee to the flower, passing the pond, the bear, and the scarecrow. Now bring the bear to the beehive; you would generate a hash string based on the sequence of visits. This may involve multiple back-and-forths, which is probably bad, but fairly brainless and robust, from what it seems, as little thought as I have given it.",1201621459

When they give the rational (but mistaken) response  ""she is against the war,"" point out her actual position. Ask if this changes their view. If you believe people are rational, you might be surprised at the results.<p>edit: I don't mean to single out women as irrational. Men are too, though in different ways (a comparable example: lots of anti-war men like McCain). But since we are discussing gender differences, the Hillary example popped into my head.",1201620120

Or does such distribution force GPL'ing of the library as well? I'm unclear as to whether this is a derived work of the GPL app or not..",1209225303

174357,comment,173916,173916,0,0,jsdalton,,,"This was interesting.<p>In the microcosm of this experiment, the choice of the free candy bar is irrational. The kids are actually choosing between two outcomes: outcome A which is three Hershey's kisses and small Snickers bar, and outcome B which is two Hershey's kisses and a large Snickers bar. Outcome B is definitely better.<p>Interestingly, in the grand scheme of things this isn't so illogical. If, for example, this was more like a storefront, where the kids could come and at any time get either free small Snickers bars or large Snickers bars for one kiss, then the former strategy is actually better.<p>Take this another step further and start to consider the cost of decision making itself. Think of the mental cost of constantly processing every outcome in search of maximum benefit and minimum cost. In the long run, applying the heuristic of FREE = GOOD is probably the best strategy from a cost/benefit perspective, since in most cases it does actually work.<p>This is a long way of saying that I think opting for free is not always rational in the immediate context but probably makes sense as a sort of general strategy for individuals in life.<p>Maybe I'm just restating the obvious but I thought I would throw this out there.",1209225138

Yeah, I could probably get hired at Google if I wanted, but I <i>don't</i> want to - and the rest of my resume isn't nearly as impressive as yours is.<p>If you're bright and independent-minded, the opportunity cost of that 4 years of college is <i>huge</i>.  I did very little related to computers in those 4 years - I did get my degree in CS, and I worked on a large volunteer website, and I did a couple projects for my school, but I spent most of my time there as a physics major or trying out various liberal-arts classes.  I graduated when I was 24.  I have a friend that's 23, and he's currently maintaining 2 open source projects, formerly on another one (LiveJournal), has a good job in a specialized niche, previously had been a startup cofounder that went bust really quick, and has done webmonkey consulting for dozens of different organizations.<p>So I dunno.  As you say, the problem is that it's impossible to tell ahead of time what you want out of life.  When I was 20 and entering college, I sorta instinctively knew I wanted to be a startup software engineer (which is what I wanted at 19) yet told myself I wanted to be a theoretical physicist (which is what I wanted at 18) and went to a liberal arts school (which is what I wanted at 17).  If it turns out you were wrong when you were young, then you thank your lucky stars that you went to that elite college and have many doors open before you.  But if it turns out you were right, then you might be cursing yourself for the lost time spent hedging your bets instead of developing your specialty.<p>One other thing: doors do slam shut if you choose not to walk through them.  I have friends who are in their late 20s or early 30s, straight-A alums of this elite college, and they've had a series of temp jobs because they couldn't decide what they wanted to do with their life.  They're finding now that they're on the ""no career"" career.  And while most of them are reasonably happy with their lives, they can't go <i>back</i> to the investment bank or biotech research lab or big software company that they turned down a job from upon graduation.",1209222230

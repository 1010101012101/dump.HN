1527750,comment,1526935,1526935,0,0,edave,,,"I think there's books written on just answering your question, I'll try and hit the highlights. To give you some background, my biz partners and I started our consulting firm as a side job in college, then when we graduated and basically said to ourselves ""why the hell not? it's been working so far."" The first 6 months or so were the hardest as we figured out what bootstrapping a full-time business meant, as compared to moonlighting from your dorm room. For example, paying your employees first means your monthly paycheck may need to wait until that next invoice is paid in a few weeks. Within 2 years our rates had increased by 5x (and not from $5->$25 either), there were 10 of us, 2.5 offices, a non-profit in Peru and we got all of our business through client referrals. However, I was also very stressed and constantly working<p>Overall:\nHonestly, technical skill is only half of doing good freelancing. Even more so as you become successful and find that you're doing more managing than technical work. And obviously, technical skill is the foundation of your freelance ability. Still, let's assume you have good technical skills.<p>If there's one thing I wish I'd learned much more about early on in my consulting firm, it is how to manage your client's expectations along the entire way- from quote -> negotiation -> project -> deliverables. I don't have any horror stories, but I feel like that was the biggest squeaky wheel as we were getting started. That, and don't worry about looking too professional. You won't be, it'll probably show in ways you don't know, and instead treat as much as you can as a learning experience rather than trying to hide your lack of knowledge. However, watch out for predatory clients who confuse naivete with lack of business expertise and try to take advantage of you or tell you ""how things are done""... to their advantage.<p>1. Clients do expect a certain level of expertise, but your rate, portfolio and past referrals should go a long ways in setting your client's expectations. Specs, even highly technical ones imo, are a fickle thing in freelance work- a phrase I've repeatedly heard from very successful freelancers is ""under-sell, over deliver."" But that's just one approach.<p>2. To be honest, there are many freelancers/firms who are not honest about their rates/development process/billable hours and they still pay the bills. On the flip side, my biz partners and I try to run our firm by the Golden Rule* and it's worked exceptionally well for us.<p>3. Yes, that is a good general rule, but you should decide early on if you want to do speculative work or not (different from pro bono work). Many firms feel that speculative work is damaging unless you are just starting out and need to establish a portfolio/set of client referrals (in which case, you're still being ""compensated"" with something of value, just not cash...). Also, you may find that you're willing to work at different rates for different clients.<p>Hope that helps!",1279519165

Thrones were faught over in wars, endless scheming, forced and tactical marriage, etc. Europe was devastated again and again for no better reason than some wacko royal trying to expand his power or go to heaven by slaughtering other peoples.<p>And no, they do not exist to keep democracy in check. They existed long before democracy and had to be removed from absolute power by force in most cases and by threatening force in others. If anything, democracy was introduced to keep the royals in check.<p>These clans together with their clerical stooges and armed thugs have wasted the world's resources for their own eccentric, self serving and unproductive endeavors for thousands of years.<p>And those constitutional monarchs, which are admittedly rather harmless, are not a counter weight to failures of TV-show democracy either. Quite the contrary. They are themselves the material for endless media gossip. Managing their own reputation is what they do all their lives. Keeping the monarchy going, that's all they do and that's all they have ever done.<p>Ah, yes, and sometimes they write strange letters to ministers about organic farming, alternative medicine or their private history Disney style architectural preferences.",1279518695

1527743,comment,1524869,1527123,0,0,kragen,,,"The difficulty with making it larger than nanoscale is that the centripetal acceleration becomes very great, which makes holding a large rotor together tricky; you need very strong materials. Actually, I did the calculations, and for visible light, it isn't even feasible at the nanoscale.<p>The centripetal acceleration of the rim of a rotor of radius r is rω². Rotating at 600THz (i.e. 600 trillion rotations per second), ω = 600T2π/s ≈ 3.8 × 10¹⁵/s.  If your radius is 1mm, then your acceleration is about 1.4 × 10²⁷ G.  The smallest rotor you can make out of atoms is probably around 0.1nm, which reduces the acceleration to only about 1.4 × 10²⁰ G.  If your rotor was, say, an orthohydrogen H₂ molecule, with a distance between the nuclei of about 62pm, and thus a radius of about 31pm, the acceleration is about 4.5 × 10¹⁹ G, which would be a weight of about 74 micrograms pulling on that single covalent bond. The nuclei would be whirling around the covalent electron cloud that bound them together at about 11.7 kilometers per second, and each of them would have about 1.13 × 10⁻¹⁷ J of kinetic energy. Unfortunately, hydrogen's ionization energy is about 2.2 × 10⁻¹⁸ J, so that's about five times as much energy as you'd need to rip the molecule apart. I think.  It could work out in the infrared, maybe. You'd just need a way to get the molecule started spinning.<p>So I guess you'd have to make your rotor a lot smaller than a diatomic molecule, or a lot stronger than a mere covalent bond.<p>Generally a 60Hz generator must spin at 360rpm <i>or slower</i> to generate 60Hz.",1279518584

1527733,comment,1526528,1526828,0,0,mkn,,,"So, I have a BS in Aero/Astro Engineering. This doesn't exactly qualify me, because when you graduate you're not an engineer, merely ready to become an engineer.<p>That said, it seems to me that the safety culture is a symptom, not an underlying cause, of the troubles that NASA is facing. Fundamentally, the political nature of NASA planning and acquisition drive NASA-designed systems toward complexity and high-performance. It is the complexity and performance of (especially) launch vehicles, combined with their stringent requirements and catastrophic failure modes that drives the safety culture. If they didn't obsess over safety, these monstrosities would fail <i>every</i> time.<p>Take a typical aerospace quality part that has $700 worth of material and labor in it. Because it is engineered with a factor of safety of, 1.05-1.2, for example, there is a $25-30,000 paper trail that documents the mine where the ore was extracted, who did the refining, what the heat treatment process was, where it was performed, and so on and so on ad infinitum ad nauseam.<p>Take the (awful) STS, for example. Congress was promised ""airline-style"" operations for this ""space pickup truck."" Well, an airliner has 0 mission-critical parts. A wing spar can fail and the skin should hold the wing together. The STS has over 700 mission-critical parts. For example, if an O-ring fails on a booster, everybody dies. If some foam hits the leading edge of the wing, everybody dies. <i>High-perf mission-critical parts seem to be a result of the political need for the appearance of technology leadership.</i><p>I can almost guarantee you that the O-rings and leading edge pieces were manufactured in different states. <i>High part-count is an artifact of the procurement process.</i><p>Elon Musk has talked about what makes SpaceX's pricing possible. (Note that they're offering launch services at 1/5 the cost of the shuttle.) He has a vertically integrated rocket factory. In one state. <i>NASA could not build the Falcon 9 if it wanted to simply because they could not vertically integrate in one state. Every state would get a piece of the pie.</i><p>Algorithmically, because that's the crowd, here, you pay an exponential administrative cost for each of the factors: performance, lateral integration, and complexity. We've done all three.<p>NASA treats the fact that the Space Shuttle is the most complex machine ever built as a point of pride, for political reasons. It's actually our national shame and folly, and has set space access back 30 years.",1279518347

If you expect this product to be highly profitable and these other companies already distribute the software with other services, they might wise up and sell it as a separate service.  If they were to unleash a feature-rich product on you with their brand image, you may find it difficult to handle.  That being said, the fact that they have not done this already might imply that it's not highly profitable.  That might be ok for you if you just want to have a smaller-scale profit with a niche audience.<p>My second suggestion is simply to talk to people, find anyone and everyone who might be slightly interested and see if you can shoot them a personal email, tweet, etc.  Most people who would get value out of what you offer would be happy to hear from you at least once.  I've been doing the same with my side-project, Sparkmuse, and the responses have been both extremely helpful and surprisingly interested.",1279516325

He may had good intentions but looking at the  big picture this is a huge step backwards. The Patriot Act, championed by his presidency, not created by the current administration, greatly increased the NSL power. That is why I single him, he was the main driving force during that time. Congress should have known better. Unfortunately they were probably being lied to, to scare them into submission the same way that they were lied to about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Don't get me wrong, I want to protect this country (USA) with all my might, but we also have to be really careful about not taking steps backwards with regards to civil liberties.

1527672,comment,1526697,1526697,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Wow, where to begin. First off, I'm really happy that Google continues to fund energy related start-ups, their solar and wind efforts are commendable.<p>Also, I'm fairly sure that the engineers behind this project are top notch and giving this project all they've got, it sure looks like they have picked some interesting challenges.<p>That said, I don't think this will ever 'fly' (pun intended) on any appreciable scale.<p>Wind is a fickle thing, and if you look at the design parameters of even the smallest windmills you realize that it takes bullet proof engineering to get a windmill to operate at all for any stretch of time without catastrophe, tying one to a kite seems to compound those problems to the point where even if the power generated were substantially higher than that on the ground you'd still be left with a higher per KW bill. Being able to operate in places where windmills are otherwise not viable is nice, but at 600 meters above the ground there will be substantial risk from getting kits entangled so the closest spacing will probably be such that a 'farm' of these will generate relatively little power for a given area of the planet over which the kites fly.<p>1 MW seems to be a pretty ambitious goal for a first setup, think about it, a 1 MW turbine sitting on the other side of a line will pull on the tether with a very impressive force, the kite will have to pull aloft a tether strong enough to withstand that force and up to 600 meters of power transmission cabling. These are not simple challenges. What I don't understand is why they don't build a 10 KW or so scale model and gain experience from that before going for a full MW, even a 10KW system flown for a year or two would give them plenty of experimental data to help design a larger one.<p>Then there are the liability issues, windmill towers are pretty solid and yet they've been known to fail. I figure the failure rate of kite lines+power lines would be substantially higher than that of a tower and so you'd have to contend with the occasional free flying kite+windmill combination.<p>All that said I wish these folks best of luck with what they're doing, but unlike the cheap solar panel revolution I highly doubt that this will ever be deployed at a scale large enough to be notable. Neat project though!",1279515825

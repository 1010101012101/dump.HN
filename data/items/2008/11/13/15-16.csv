The language is almost as cobbled together and inconsistent as PHP with the added bonus of being worked on almost exclusively by engineers instead of people who actually want to write programs (this coming  from an engineering student here).<p>That being said, if you have the mathematical chops to rearrange your problem into something solvable via matrix transformations, you can probably write it quickly and elegantly in Matlab without worrying too greatly about execution speed. Better, the built in toolboxes have already solved huge (engineering) problem spaces. Code already written is better than code potentially written...<p>Unless you want a solution that is repeatable or more general than Matlab affords. At that point you'd be better off doing the math by hand. I feel that the Python <i>et al</i> and C solutions fit into this niche. Prototype the math in Matlab, implement in a language that doesn't suck.",1226591997

Denying people who can't pay reduces the good you are doing - doesn't it?<p>Maybe an answer is that there's nothing wrong when people pay - because then they <i>do</i> get the value you created.  It's only an issue when people cannot pay, and you deny them, because it's only in that case that your potential for doing good is unfulfilled.<p>I think the latter case only happens when (1) your prices are too high for the value particular users get from your software; or (2) too high for their wallet.<p>I think the solution to the first problem is to price your software (roughly) in proportion to the value customers get from it. E.g. ""per seat"" or ""per server"" or ""volume-base"" pricing does this. It's better to under-price than overprice (in reality, there's a huge range of values that customers get from a product, some get much more value from it than others - if you price too low, some get a fantastic bargain; too high, and you deny some).<p>For the second problem, some kind of charity version is appropriate, where you give it away to someone who just can't afford to pay for the value they would get from it. e.g. student versions. In economic theory, a loan would probably be appropriate; but a gift is nicer and simpler.<p>These problems become simple if your software actually helps people earn or save money themselves - then it's a non-issue that they can and should pay for it.<p>essay: <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/good.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/good.html</a><p>video: <a href=""http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/paul-graham-at-startup-school-08"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/paul-graham-at-startu...</a>)",1226590060

They were both designed for engineers (I mean <i>engineers</i>, not computer programmers) to explore matrix models interactively, then save their work as scripts - you were never meant to use m-files for general purpose programming. MATLAB was the first GUI programming I did that wasn't just for myself.<p>What you're paying for with MATLAB is access to the Mathworks Toolboxes. If you need them then it's absolutely worth every penny. If you don't, Octave will do. You also get prettier graphics with MATLAB than gnuplot can do. Matplotlib is good, but it's nowhere near MATLAB, which does a heck of a lot more than plotting 2D graphs.<p>I think Python will get an increasing market share here because it's free and easy to use and lets you do things that are clunky in MATLAB like parsing log files (in the past I have used C or Perl to munge things into a format MATLAB will like tho' it <i>is</i> possible in m-files). I don't think MATLAB is in any danger tho', it does too much too well and has enormous mindshare and legacy (no-one doing civil or mechanical or aeronautical engineering cares what Google uses to show people ads - SRSLY). Think about how people happily pay for Photoshop when there's GIMP. DSP is another big MATLAB market, but (AFAIK) biologists aren't doing the matrix-heavy computations that it's best suited for.<p>You can get a cheap version of MATLAB when you're a student (or know a student) it used to have a limited matrix size (256*256 IIRC) but I think now it doesn't.

There's no fuzziness about whether you have >300 photos or not, and the consequence of the older ones disappearing is gentle and non-punitive.<p>You can do the same thing with a software license, by having versions with different functionality - feature subset, capacity limits. Some companies have a ""community"" version that is free.<p>He's also talking about models where you benefit from the ""free"" users - for selling software, bug reports and feature requests are valuable information, for product quality and market needs.<p>One danger is that if you whet people's appetite with a free version, you can be priming them as fuel for a free/open source competitor!

Background: She's a PhD student and will graduate in May or August.<p>Option 1) She continues what she's doing right now,  research and lab work, and occasionally pick up a shift at a ""real"" job. However, we wouldn't have health insurance, and that is crucial (pre-existing conditions and baby).<p>Option 2) She gets a full time job, with benefits. The downside is that we would then need full time daycare for the baby, which is something I am against. Yes, it would only be for a few months, but I think it would be too much for her, since she would essentially be a single mom.<p>Crazy Option 3) We pick up and move to Cambridge/Mountain View. This would keep the family together, but the logistics of figuring that out while starting a company make my head hurt just thinking about it.<p>Ultimately, a 3 month separation would be an incredible stressor on our marriage, and that is something I'm not willing to sacrifice.",1226588584

Ok some neat functionality and easy matrix manipulation but pretty ugly and language isn't as nice as Python. Not sure about interoperability with other tools.<p>I already knew Python so I naturally tried numpy+scipy+matplotlib and was literally blown away. So easy to use, really nice plotting capabilities and it is extremely convenient using a real and interactive programming language, especially when that language is Python. Being able to do everything with one tool is awesome.<p>I haven't tried Matlab yet because it costs money. Big minus right there obv especially since it is not exactly cheap.\nIt is also proprietary which is a another problem.\nFrom what I have gathered it is an awesome tool though and there are huge amounts of Matlab-code out there.<p>Have any of you tried both? Which do you prefer and why?\nDo you think Scipy can take over? \nPython seem to be used everywhere in science; signal processing, chemistry, bioinformatics, NASA, Google etc.<p>I have found a library for pretty much everything for Scipy though. I mean having 10 different FFT-libs isn't exactly much of a plus, one great one is enough.\nSo does Matlab beat Scipy on that point or not?\nAnd is Matlab much better than Octave? Different feel?\nDoes Matlab allow easy interaction with databases and other tools?",1226588544

Yes they have MobileMe, but that's very different - people pay for it which makes up for inefficiencies.  Google (and even Microsoft and Yahoo) are very efficient (cost-wise) when it comes to web services compared to Apple.  Now, there is always the possibility that Apple will replace Google with a competitor in Safari should Google's agreement become less lucrative for them.<p>Seriously, their evidence is Apple not liking Android?  If it were a real fight Google wouldn't be developing for the iPhone awesome stuff like the street view that auto-pans as you move the phone. Companies both compete and cooperate all the time.  Toyota sells hybrid technology to Ford and also produces cars that compete with Ford's.  Likewise, Apple and Google will both cooperate and compete.",1226588529

[...] The biggest attraction of YC to me is the cumulative experience and knowledge of the founders, and I worry that I wouldn't get that with a standard VC path.</i><p>How do you expect to get a ""similar program"" without moving?  The cumulative experience and knowledge of YCers isn't something which can be conveyed remotely.<p>My google-fu is failing at the moment, but I remember seeing a comment from pg here a while ago to the extent that YC once tried funding a team remotely, but it didn't work due to the lack of frequent contact.  Don't look at YC's move-across-the-country requirement as a roadblock they're putting up -- look at it as them trying to maximize the chance that the companies they fund will succeed.<p>(That said, I submitted a YC application in spite of not being able to move -- but I wasn't really expecting to be accepted, and if I had been accepted, it would have taken sitting down and trying to figure out exactly how YC could help a non-local startup before I would have accepted.)",1226588421

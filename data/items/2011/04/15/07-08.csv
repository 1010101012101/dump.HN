I'd pick a developer who used a language they knew inside and out and were informed and aware of the downsides of the language over a zealot who thinks their language of choice works best in every situation (my most common experience of these types are in the ruby community, by a quirk of coincidence).<p>PHP was the language I used to teach myself how to develop for the server-side when I'd been purely a front end dev many years ago and I still like it (though granted I like Scala more) because it's always felt like a language you can sit down and get shit done with quickly and without fuss, and sometimes that is as important as any other attribute you can attach to any other language choice.",1302854322

Some of the movements are reality based, some are based on perceptions. Commodity trading (specifically oil) is highly profitable. It can be hacked by the people who know the ins and outs. They'll never tell you, but it can. Most everything can be hacked in some way. I highly doubt the few who are able to profit from the ignorance of millions will confess that some troubles in the Middle East don't significantly impact the supply chain.

Elephants are an endangered species because poachers kill them for their ivory, and they are protected in most countries. Only in Zimbabwe, a totally corrupt state that has pretty much collapsed, was Parsons able to get permission to ""hunt"" elephants. His attempt to spin it as a heroic and humanitarian act was pathetic. There are several measures you can take to prevent elephants straying into cropland, all costing a fraction of what Parsons will have paid to stage his stunt. So all up, there's not much to like.<p>Second, this doesn't make GoDaddy a terrible company. But it does mean that their CEO has terrible judgement. For most people, the elephant slaughter was the straw that broke the camel's back. We had endured the awful user interface and saturation upselling for years, but for all the reasons explained in the comments above, we didn't switch our domains.

I'll address each of his points...<p>China Doesn't Own Us: He rightly points out that China only owns about 10% of the nation's total debt (some say it's closer to 12% but same difference).  The problem is most of that came in the last 5 years or so (China only became the largest US debtor in 2008).  So while China doesn't ""own us"" their increasing amount of US debt on a yearly basis makes us beholden to them because the economic crisis caused most of the other sources of money to dry up.  So if we can't stop ourselves from spending more than we take in we'll have to start dancing to China's tune.<p>(Something to note about the above point is China owns a lot more than is immediately clear.  So, for example, Japan owns almost as much US debt as China but China has been buying Japanese debt at a record pace)<p>The deficit will shrink dramatically: People who quote OMB numbers are being dishonest because those numbers are almost always wrong.  The OMB (like the Congressional Budget Office) answers to politicians and they make their assumptions based on the figures given to them by politicians.  If the politicians say this budget will cause unemployment to drop to 4% than the OMB makes its calculations based on that assumption.  But politicians always want to paint a rosy picture which is why the numbers that come out of the OMB and CBO are always too optimistic<p>The US has the highest corporate tax rate: He doesn't dispute that but his point is ""it's been higher in the past"".  That's true but not really relevant.  In terms of corporations we compete with other nations.  Where a large corporation chooses to put its HQ is largely based on the corporate tax rate since that same corporation can have satellite offices in other countries.  So it really is an issue that our corporate tax rate is so high (though not that big an issue since, as the author points out, most corporations cheat the system and pay virtually no taxes which is a problem)<p>I actually don't disagree with the author on a lot of his conclusions (I believe the Bush tax cuts need to go, that we need tax reform, and so on).  But he's painting inaccurate pictures here and that bugs me.",1302853187

If so - no.<p>That's a ""turtles all the way down"" argument.<p>Prices need to be sustained by demand. Traders may make money via moves on the fluctuation. But buying a lot of oil in order to push the price up is not a business model. You have to store it (expensive), transport it, and then when you come to sell it the price will decline again. Not to  mention the risk you incurr by holding it, and the opportunity cost of not using that money to do something else at the time.<p>An idea that does the rounds regularly is that a conspiracy of evil speculators permanently distort markets. I've never seen a situation where that was true. There may be periods where the market does odd things, and market manipulation does exist, but unless it's a locked-up market (like diamonds) or a true conspiracy of all the players (can't think of an example) it will eventually have to revert to the mean because the traders will start calling bluff.<p>Usually when you see people blaming speculators it's someone trying to cover up ineptitude or corruption by picking an easy target.<p>When this kind of talk gets momentum the results can be bad. A common target during collapsing bubbles is short-sellers (people who borrow stock, and sell it, with the promise to re-buy it and give it back to its original owner at another time, possibly tomorrow). Short-sellers contribute to price discovering in markets, and this is a good thing. But during bubbles, people who know about shorting can do well when others are doing badly, so they're an easy target.<p>US regulators stroked this theme during the economic crisis and introduced measures that limited short-selling for a period. In doing so, they contributed to the crisis because short-sellers provide a lot of the liquidity behind money markets. Cuffing short-sellers removed their liquidity pool from money markets, which was already under strain.",1302852753

However the current economic state of the western society affords us to indulge in intellectual enrichment purely for the sake of it. In the pre 18th century era the difference between having and not having vocational training translated to the difference between starving and freezing to death or not. Now, even earning minimum wage or something close to it can afford us food and shelter, thus making the risk of going to school for ""your passion"" rather than ""find work"" much less life-threatening. Excluding a few exceptions, the economic gap has shrunken between the rich and poor. Given this comparative cushioned state, it is absolutely reasonable for universities to be expected to provide intellectual fulfillment and feed curiosities.",1302852147

One can argue that Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc are easy, but those are different sites/app with different user interfaces. Popcorn Time is one program that has all of their content and more.<p>Popcorn Time might hurt Netflix a little in the short-term with lost users, but long-term (5+ years) I think it could help. Some of the big players in the movie industry haven&#x27;t wanted Netflix to become what Apple became for the music industry. If the alternative is piracy (i.e. no money), then their hand may be forced to give Netflix more content on better terms.",1441745980

Generate random AES cipher key (I used a 16 byte key) using any available <i>secure</i> rng (it all depends on where the thing gets it&#x27;s entropy, I think node&#x27;s crypto.getRandomBytes is supposed to be strong)<p>2. Pad & Encrypt  data with AES<p>3. Encrypt randomly-generated key with RSA<p>4. Send the message in an envelope like: {key: <RSA encrypted AES key>, data: <AES encrypted data>}<p>For me, the devil was in the details -- padding took an especially long time for me to understand and solve (the thing I was working on was cross platform, so ruby->js or python->ruby, and of course not all implementations pad the same way), but once that was solved, most other things were easy. The node part was also particularly troubling because I had to deal with the way to specify encodings in node, which was kind of confusing (I spent a lot of time messing with base64/binary encoding and having my terminal start showing gibberish when I tried to print binary data)<p>I don&#x27;t have access to that code now (I actually wrote it in order to get around the fact that internal networks at a certain company I used to work at didn&#x27;t have a custom rootCA/support TLS properly), otherwise I&#x27;d just post it.<p>Would love to help with the implementation though",1441745102

So the article compares universities paying no taxes and receiving no taxpayer funds with universities paying no taxes and receiving taxpayer funds.  And then they try to skew the comparison by equating &quot;taxes we could get if we took away non-profit status&quot; with &quot;taxes we already take from taxpayers and pay out&quot;.  The amounts might both be denominated in dollars, but the payer and payee are materially different.<p>Among other things, consider that people donate and make endowments to public universities as well.

I&#x27;d then try to trade items for general commodity items, like high runes, or certain skill items that were used as a form of trading currency due to their high demand.<p>The bots had some custom features that would let you bypass IP bans by logging into your router&#x27;s settings, changing the mac address, and restarting your internet connection so you can get a new IP address.<p>One of the bots I used was written in the AutoIt Scripting Language. Since the bot was open source, I was able to see how the code was structured and modify it myself.<p>I attribute my introduction to programming to this farming bot, and I believe is one of the reasons I chose to study Computer Science.<p>The cherry on top was that I made about $600-$700 when I was 14 or 15 years old by selling a lot of farmed items on ebay.<p>Personally, Diablo III was a big disappointment for me.

10187892,comment,10181931,10186898,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Hey AJ -- if you&#x27;re &quot;Alexis J&quot; from support, I think you and I exchanged a couple of messages on this issue: #5926006. It was a little messy:<p>1. I was using Gandi for, I think, only the second time, and I initiated the account creation process from a domain transfer (account #1).<p>2. During the account creation process, I think there was a small field labeled something like, &quot;Create a new Gandi handle&quot;, which to me sounded like a pretty good idea: I could create something more memorable for my client rather than a random-numbered GANDI- account, so I used the shortened form of my client&#x27;s primary domain. This created account #2.<p>3. What actually happened was that both account #1 and account #2 were created, account #2 was an ordinal number away from account #1 (so, SS00003 and SS00004 for example), and the password was clobbered on account #1.<p>4. I then signed in to account #2 to look at the domain transfer status and found that no domains were listed there. Odd. So I tried signing in to account #1 and couldn&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t remember why but the password reset function wasn&#x27;t working (I probably wasn&#x27;t receiving the emails).<p>At this point I thought the UI was a little confusing but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. I&#x27;ve dealt with almost exactly this same issue with GoDaddy and it just took a phone call and they sorted it out in a few minutes. I was less happy to realize you don&#x27;t have a phone support option, but that&#x27;s on me -- I should&#x27;ve checked that first. I refuse to use live chat because my experience with that has been universally bad; live chat always gets shunted to support people that are restricted to a script and can apologize a lot but never actually fix anything.<p>5. So I started a support request and was polite at first, explaining the situation. What I got back was a request for &quot;company documentation establishing you as a representative of the company [...]&quot; and &quot;articles of incorporation, and a scan copy of the government issued identification of one of the signing parties on said document&quot;.<p>6. That got a slightly less polite response from me saying that under no circumstances would I burden my client with a paperwork request over this, and reiterating again that it should be clear that I created both account #1 and account #2, that my credit card and billing information was used to pay for the process, that I successfully initiated a transfer of four different domains, and that I thought this should be reasonable and sufficient evidence of access on their behalf.<p>7. After that there were a couple of more exchanges between Dante A. and Alexis J. and me; Dante wrote a polite long email repeating that there was no way for Gandi to confirm that I created account #1 and giving me a tip for using Gandi in the future, and Alexis J. chimed in to say that Gandi doesn&#x27;t retain payment information &quot;for security reasons&quot;.<p>At this point I was slightly horrified at the experience, especially in the context of having received significantly more useful support from GoDaddy of all places in the past for almost exactly this same issue (merging two accounts). I couldn&#x27;t imagine sticking a client with this kind of support. I have to navigate support channels for lots of different companies on a regular basis, that&#x27;s part of my job, and it&#x27;s unusual for me to get completely stymied by support anymore.<p>It didn&#x27;t help that all four domains were close to expiration and that one of them appeared to have a transfer problem but you couldn&#x27;t give me any information on the transfer status of that domain. I was left with one of two choices: either wait and see if the domain transfers first or expires first, or try to initiate an immediate transfer with another registrar and potentially complicate matters even further. I opted for waiting and fortunately that turned out OK, but I had several days to stew over not being able to tell what was going on.<p>I did get one thing wrong in my complaint upthread though, when going back over the email thread I realized your turnaround was pretty OK, there&#x27;s just shy of four and a half hours elapsed between your initial support response and the second-to-last message in the thread, for a total of 8 messages back and forth.<p>Given the support response, I can&#x27;t tell if Gandi support was refusing to help for policy reasons, or if support actually doesn&#x27;t have access to the information that they need to sort out problems like this.<p>If it&#x27;s the first, Gandi&#x27;s support personnel need to be trained to handle exceptions IMO. That&#x27;s why there are humans in support, and not automated Q&A forms. I&#x27;m fully aware of the security risks posed by poorly-trained personnel attempting to evaluate a security-related situation, but I think that refusing to think about anything related to security is an even worse response.<p>If it&#x27;s the second, Gandi&#x27;s systems need some tweaking. The UI for the account signup process is a bit confusing; &quot;create a new Gandi handle&quot; should do a better job of explaining exactly what&#x27;s about to happen, and it shouldn&#x27;t clobber the password for the first account that was created. There&#x27;s no &quot;security reasons&quot; for not retaining at least the last 4 of the credit card number used for a transaction, and maybe even a billing name and/or zip code. It should also be easy for support personnel to see that one Gandi account created another Gandi account, and if someone sends in a request with a problem like mine, you should be able to say, &quot;oh, ok, you have access to account #2 but everything&#x27;s stuck in account #1, hang on, let me merge those for you, sorry for the trouble.&quot;<p>Also, I just realized I never actually did transfer those domains from Gandi. Oops. Doing that now.",1441742542

Again, if you want to buy a new car and get rid of it after the lease is paid, they will be fine. If you want to keep it longer, look somewhere else.",1441742509

To get them involved into &#x27;selling&#x27; your app.<p>Because I really think its difficult (actually almost impossible) to sell to all individuals like me. You are not tre first and not the last offering this kind of &#x27;directory&#x27;. You need critical mass. By offering something unique and/or promote differently. If there is a benefit (added value) for the workspaces then they might be compelled to do the selling for you. Much easier ;-)",1441742444

Serious question.<p>My fiancee was fixing up an old computer to give to our nephew, and when she tried to install Firefox, it refused, essentially saying, ""Your computer is too old."" * She grabbed a 2.x install file from OldApps.com, but many of the people still running IE6 <i>won't</i> be tech savvy enough to do that, and are likely to be running really old computers. (And even when FF <i>can</i> be installed, it tends to suck up memory. What do you do with a computer that maxes out at 128MB ram?)<p>* I think it was a memory issue, but mainly I remember that it was unexpectedly off-putting.",1232542773

Instead I found this convoluted moon-laser analogy.

There really aren't that many jobs out there, so you can get a decent programmer who'll take the pay cut just to have a job.<p>But you do have some other options.<p>You can give out different titles, lets say someone is just starting out, and you start calling them senior developer on paper, no impact now, but for their next job they'll be able to ask for a lot more money .<p>The stock options etc have been mentioned, so I won't cover it.<p>Office space, stay away from the cubicles, and have a relaxed policy.<p>Workhours, instead of working 9 to 5, offer them to work 10 to 5. + have general flexibility, better to have a good programmer for 4 days, than have someone crappy for 5.<p>Basically use small stuff like this to make yourself appealing to a certain niche of programmers.

443136,comment,442544,443049,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Jet airplanes also give you something like 600 mph of initial velocity.  In the case of Pegasus and Space Ship One, they are like the first stage rocket.<p>The Rocket Equation is pretty nasty.  When your required delta-v goes up, your reaction mass requirement goes up <i>faster than a polynomial function</i>.  Saving the initial 600 mph is very significant.  Balloons -- only sounding rockets use those, but they don't do anything but gain altitude anyhow.  If you need escape velocity or orbit, then they are pretty much useless.  (You might as well build a slightly bigger rocket.)<p>Please actually do the physics before you post vacuous statements like:<p><i>The physics is there and probably workable.</i><p>People are having ""intelligent discussions"" about balloon assisted launch?

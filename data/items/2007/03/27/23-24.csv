If you are capturing all this on a blog with the snippets or highlights pulled back via RSS, then maybe yes.<p><i>'... the way I currently use computer technology improves my life? ... technology sets me free? technology enslaves me? ...'</i> [0]<p>As you have an insight it gets posted to twitter, then you pull it on your blog and you can read stuff in context. But twitter is suffering from 'continuous partial attention' [1]. everyone will listen one second and switch to Winer or Scoble the next.<p>\nReference<p>[0] ITConversations, Linda Stone, ""Continuous Partial Attention""<p><a href=""http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail739.html"">http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail739.html</a><p>[1] ITConversations, Linda Stone, ""Continuous Partial Attention"", Ibid.\n",1175039192

6730,comment,6671,6671,0,0,sethjohn,,,"With all the coverage of Justin.tv, it's surprising that this is the first time I've seen anyone raise the issue of Justin (et al)'s personality. Of course, valleywag (being valleywag) brought it up in a gossipy obnoxious way, but still, shouldn't that have been one of the first and most obvious questions to ask?",1175038764
6729,comment,6668,6668,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"I'm still doubtful about the ""Revenue is not important"" thing.  Maybe right now you can get acquired with no revenues, but that probably won't last.  People said revenue didn't matter during the Web 1.0 IPO bubble, and that turned out wrong.  To be convinced otherwise I'd have to see the accounting for these web deals showing a return on investment.  And if the profits are predicated on web advertising call me skeptical about the sustainability.<p>To my knowledge the ""revenue-less liquidity event"" route to riches is new circa 1998, e.g. The Globe and other such IPOs.  This route is probably a symptom of the global liquidity bubble rather than a lasting development.  We are still in a global liquidity explosion that measurably started around 1995.  It has fueled all kinds of bubbles and weird business practices and now it's fueling acquisitions, just like it's fueling Private Equity deals and stock buybacks.  We are in financially anomalous times.",1175038621

6726,comment,6689,6706,0,0,bootload,,,"Valid Identity:<p> <i>'... Were these attacks made in the comments or were they first-class posts? ...'</i><p>Good point. Would a solution be only having comments if you supply an openId? [0] The idea being you have to ID yourself to comment. Would validation of identity be one way to help solve this?<p> <i>'... Bloggers aren't responsible for things said in their comments. ...'</i><p>I wonder how the legals would view that? How much due care do you have to take? The thing with comments is, if you allow anyone to comment without limits, it's your reputation that will be smeared. If you have control or ownership of a system you are responsible. So it pays to control, restrict who and what comments are made. This is one of the key points <i>allegedly</i> made ... why do reputable sites allow such posts to persist?<p>Post Restriction:<p>I've seen a variety of techniques from timed or posts delayed until authorised to the extreme of no comments. They work to some degree but do not scale well. My personal idea is to have a blog that has no comments that points to a system requiring login (overhead, time and effort & identity) to comment.<p><p>\n<i>'...

6725,comment,6658,6658,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I have to agree with the writer of this article, except I think it would be better to remove the ""Viral"" tag altogether.  I think that marketing in general has gone too far.  Certainly appealing to the generosity of people and then throwing it back in our faces is beginning to go too far, and I think the author of the article does a good job of thoroughly describing where Nissan went wrong, so I'll just shut up now.",1175037879

6723,comment,6658,6688,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I don't think he's asking how long until people stop caring about viral marketing, but how long until people stop caring in general, i.e. about humanity.  I think the problem lies not in viral marketing itself, but in Nissan's implementation of viral marketing.  I think that the methods of these different types of viral marketing are analogous to the goals of white hat and black hat hackers.  A practice that may be generally good and clever can be thoroughly spoiled by those who take advantage of it for the wrong reasons.",1175037614

6720,comment,6668,6668,0,0,hundreddollar,,,"My favorite part is this: ""To almost everyone except criminals, it seems an axiom that if you need money, you should get a job."" As an entrepreneur, I'm happy to almost be in the same category as a criminal. ;) <p>I also love the 0% dissatisfaction idea, whether or not the result is a success. The experience of launching your own project just can't be replicated. Any of the points you mentioned, even if the result is complete failure, is well worth the expense of time & risk. ",1175036556

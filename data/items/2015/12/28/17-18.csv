There&#x27;s evidence suggesting, though, that morals are a lot more about survival of our instinctual identification of &quot;species&quot; than they are about the inviolable rights of other sentient organisms (i.e. &quot;Sure that cow has thoughts, but it&#x27;s not a PERSON, so eat up&quot;).",1451325596
10802355,comment,10799717,10801798,0,0,HelloMcFly,,,"> There&#x27;s isn&#x27;t any conflicting data.<p>I don&#x27;t read blogs or HuffPo, I try to find the research, and I find plenty of - if-not-conflicting - difficult to fully reconcile evidence. My wife is a pediatrician who tries to keep up with this stuff, and she would disagree with you as well. I&#x27;m not just talking about diet comparisons alone, I&#x27;m talking about the merits and dangers of individual foods and food types. There&#x27;s a lot of research, not all of it saying the same thing. It&#x27;s not easy to parse all of the caveats, confounding factors, and unique populations.<p>> I challenge you to post some actual links to articles here which advocate a high-fat or low-carb diet.<p>Here&#x27;s one [1], [2]. Your criticism of [1] will be &quot;low sample size&quot;, which is fair. But then most studies with large sample sizes are retrospective, which is the other major criticism. Your criticism of [2] will be the population type, which is also fair.<p>> You can&#x27;t eat cholesterol-laden meals without also consuming vast amounts of saturated fat, for instance.<p>There&#x27;s much said about the evil of saturated fat, and some of it is clearly true such as a link to heart disease (or is it? suggests one of many not-hard-to-find conflicting sources [3]; [4]) other evils are less clear. Much early criticism at it was given because it was thought to increase cholesterol, which isn&#x27;t the case for <i>most</i> individuals; when cholesterol is impacted, it&#x27;s primarily impacting the HDL:LDL ratio (or alternatively, Total:HDL).<p>This study [5] suggests little difference in saturated vs. other types of fat, though it relied on self-reporting. The story is more nuanced, as [6] suggests, with some clear influence on some things and mixed results elsewhere. [7] is interesting though as it indicates a link between saturated fat and heart disease, but suggests replacing saturated fat with carbs slightly increases that risk.<p>> Whatever nit-picked understanding you have of how cholesterol works in the human physiology will not refute this fact.<p>It&#x27;s hardly fair to deride someone for accurately pointing out the small connection between dietary and bodily cholesterol. That&#x27;s not a nit-picked understanding, it&#x27;s something worth knowing.<p>> But what you&#x27;ve done by feeling satiated is miss out on nutritionally-dense foods and replace them with poor quality foods which just fill you up.<p>I&#x27;m not the OP, but it&#x27;s certainly not one or the other for me. I eat high-fat foods (dairy, nuts, legumes, olive oil, eggs), and nutritionally dense foods (leafy greens, root vegetables). I don&#x27;t disagree with your conclusions in general, but do think it is a bit over-dismissive.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v63/n8/full/ejcn20094a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v63/n8/full/ejcn20094a.ht...</a><p>[2] (PDF WARNING) <a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1475-2840-8-35.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1475-2840-8-35.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648?dopt=AbstractPlus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648?dopt=AbstractPlu...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20685950?dopt=AbstractPlus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20685950?dopt=AbstractPlu...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://annals.org/article.aspx?doi=10.7326/M13-1788&an_fo_ed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://annals.org/article.aspx?doi=10.7326/M13-1788&an_fo_ed</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11745-010-3393-4/fulltext.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11745-010-3393-4/f...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/5/1425.abstract?ijkey=99ecdbcda47e1604f229ec5e7225596119769c60&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/5/1425.abstract?ijkey=9...</a>",1451325582

As a percentage of library artifacts, they&#x27;ll increase over time.<p>Plenty of people will be &quot;into&quot; converting popular books.  Then a smaller subset are into nation wide distributed but unpopular books.  Then books not written in the local language or current language.  Finally you end up with artifacts that are valuable to researchers but might only be read every century or so.  Consider small town city council meeting records.  Or church records of baptisms and funerals (and burials).<p>Aside from technological or economic collapse (good thing those two have never historically happened and therefore can never happen in the future...) the library of 2030 will be a lot like a museum is today, except perhaps more hands on.  So you can walk into the genealogical room and its basically unchanged from 2015.  Teen fiction, well, maybe that will be gone entirely.  The concept of special collections or rare books will be eliminated because the only remaining books will either be special or rare.<p>What to do with all the space and salary is interesting.  My suspicion is the days of 90%+ of American kids living less than 15 minutes walking distance from a public library are about to come to an end.  I live in the county seat and have the largest public library, and probably every library in the county will eventually close and send all their genealogical artifacts to our formerly city now county library.  We already have a small county historical society museum and I would not be surprised to see them merge with &quot;the&quot; county library.<p>Probably not a good decade to try to get a library science degree and become a librarian.<p>Interestingly there is a subculture that refuses to read off screens, even here, on an online on-screen discussion site, and that combined with very rapid printers and print on demand and ordering online means that bizarrely enough there might be more paper books in 2030 than in 2015, its just that cities won&#x27;t pile so many up in one building.  Much like the decline of public wells as a source of urban drinking water doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;ve evolved past water drinking, it just means we have more faucets than mouths now, including faucets in our homes, so a neighborhood sharing a well seems weird and is basically culturally dead.

Given that this is a government project, I&#x27;m gonna guess closer to the high bound.<p>Second, the Saturn V/Apollo mission was a diplomatic show of muscle. Those who believe the SLS will be the future of manned space travel fail to appreciate that without the pressure of the Soviet Union, there is absolutely no way the project will outlast the attrition of a 10-year non-wartime Congressional budget session.<p>And all that is moot anyway, as the Saturn V and Apollo systems were built extremely fast, and to do that meant using a myriad of sub contractors [0].<p>According to Ars[1], the SLS basically had to reverse engineer an F-1 that was pulled from one of the Apollo launches. There were no extant blueprints for a massive LOX/RP engine, and few people alive who had any experience with it. SCUD missile builders with deep government contacts and ensured the STS (Space Shuttle) system would largely rely on the force of solid boosters, with the LOX engines significantly reduced in size and totally different from the Saturn V boosters.<p>More than anything, the Ars article points out how absurdly homebrewed the Saturn V was. Hand drilled nozzle ports? The system was hacked together for one purpose, and then discarded. What Space X is doing, and what SLS will fail to do, is make orbit accessible to people besides a government that controls the world&#x27;s fiat currency and can basically do what it wants provided it has the political capital (as it did during the Cold War).<p>The Saturn V and Apollo system will stand as one of the greatest achievements of the modern era. But, like the Pyramids of Giza, it did little to spur a sea change of similar technology. There is no great proliferation of massive pyramids after those at Giza were built.

Is it part of a bigger web framework like Ruby on Rails?  Nope.  As far as I can tell &quot;being written for the web&quot; is just marketing.",1451323012

I have countless little rituals I&#x27;ve collected and iterated on for years that serve to ground me and make my time productive no matter where I&#x27;m at.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed two different kinds, bottom-up rituals and the top-down variety. Bottom up rituals evolve organically out of whatever space / situation I happen to find myself in. In some situations I find I need a daily walk to help collect my thoughts whenever life is getting a bit too chaotic. Another ritual I might use when my workload is high is to collect tasks onto a sheet of paper, one per line. This happens perhaps twice a year and is a signal that there is mental cruft that needs to be cleaned out. The process of clearing out the list and striking the line items off of it is meditative and serves to bring that cruft to the surface so I can deal with it.<p>Top-down happens whenever I decide I need to make a focused change in my life and need a new set of ruts to run my wagon in. I started going to the gym every day a few months ago. I have a very specific routine that I change from time to time to keep it fresh. I often have to acquire things and maintain them in order to keep the routine convenient so I don&#x27;t have an excuse to skip it.<p>It&#x27;s gotten to where if I&#x27;m feeling unproductive, I start looking at my rituals, have I stopped any recently without noticing?

You can make up all these models that say it&#x27;s going to cause inflation, and then people use the extra money to pay down debts which cancels the inflation (because debt creates money and paying debt destroys money). If they then use some of the money they would otherwise have paid in interest on the debt to pay down even more principal then you&#x27;ve printed money and caused deflation. Butterfly = hurricane.<p>Come on, every human observation of reality is a macro observation of billions of atoms interacting with each other. We don&#x27;t need to dive into chaos theory to observe that there are singular macro results arising from the chaotic effects of zillions of atoms interacting with one another. We build planes and cars out of the macro phenomena of billions of atoms. Economically speaking, Macro effects are evident for this: When you print money you inflate the economy, it&#x27;s a pretty fundamental concept.<p>>You&#x27;ve never seen Adobe or Microsoft? Students pirate the software and then businesses have to buy it because it&#x27;s what the graduates know how to use. Network effects. Mindshare. Economies of scale. Developers developers developers. Support contracts. The first hit is free.<p>That&#x27;s called free trials in which the product is rendered useless once the trial period is up. It&#x27;s taken back so the supply was only increased temporarily. It&#x27;s more like a loan then QE.<p>>I see what you&#x27;re misunderstanding. Lowering interest rates is the same thing as printing money. In order to cause interest rates to go down, The Fed has to put money into the economy. QE is what they call it when the federal funds rate is effectively zero but they still want to add more money to the economy, so they have to pour it in from a different spigot. It&#x27;s fundamentally the same thing as lowering interest rates, people just notice it more because they don&#x27;t do it as often.<p>You&#x27;re the one misunderstanding. Dude printing money is different from loaning money. QE is rare because printing money is bad. Lowering interest rates is the primary method for jump starting the economy when there is a recession anyone who knows what they&#x27;re talking about knows this. This is off topic anyway, but it&#x27;s evident to me that you lack certain knowledge about the banking system.<p>>The law of supply and demand is broken in monopoly markets. The price is whatever the monopoly says it is. The Fed sets the interest rate.<p>You&#x27;re digressing off topic. Either way this statement makes no sense. Monopolies control price because they control supply. The law of supply and demand is NEVER broken. What does the Fed have to do with this? Nothing.<p>>The law of supply and demand is broken in monopoly markets. The price is whatever the monopoly says it is. The Fed sets the interest rate.\nBut the real reason the analogy fails is that counterfeiting currency creates no value, so when you exchange counterfeit currency for something of value, the thing you take away from the seller has value and the thing you give does not. It has cost society something to give you that thing. The thing you&#x27;re &quot;stealing&quot; when you counterfeit currency isn&#x27;t the money, it&#x27;s what the money buys. (This is perhaps easier to understand when you forge a gift certificate rather than currency.)\nBut when you make a copy of information, &quot;he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.&quot; You aren&#x27;t taking anything away from society, you&#x27;re only gaining something for yourself.\nIt&#x27;s the difference between stealing a loaf of bread and causing the baker to lose a potential sale because you bake your own bread using his recipe.<p>Cash is a medium for bartering. It&#x27;s an intermediary instrument. Selling a banana for $1 then using that $1 to buy an apple is roughly the same trading that banana for an apple. The same concept applies to copying information and counterfeiting money. If I copy a music track then sell it for $1 then use that dollar to buy an apple it&#x27;s equivalent to counterfeiting a dollar to buy an apple. Superficially speaking copying software seems like it doesn&#x27;t harm anyone just like how printing money &quot;seems&quot; like it doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone.<p>Heck imagine this ludicrous example: if I give a counterfeit dollar to the baker for some bread he wasn&#x27;t &quot;hurt&quot; because he can spend that counterfeit dollar on something else and that &quot;someone else&quot; can also spend the counterfeit dollar... and so on and so on... the chain can continue so no one is hurt! Obviously, this is not the case and it&#x27;s the same thing when you copy information. It only seems like no one was hurt.<p>>The whole deal with the baker is clearly irrelevant in that case because that transaction is real currency for real goods. The people most clearly being shafted are the customers because they&#x27;re paying money for pirated goods (which they presumably think are legitimate). And then the software vendor is being shafted to the extent that any of those customers would otherwise have paid for the real version.<p>Dude the baker was your example, it came from you, you can&#x27;t just call it irrelevant because it contradicts your statements. The main point is, someone gets shafted when you copy software, you said it yourself and I quote: &quot;The people most clearly being shafted are the customers because they&#x27;re paying money for pirated goods (which they presumably think are legitimate). And then the software vendor is being shafted to the extent that any of those customers would otherwise have paid for the real version.&quot;<p>>Theft is something people viscerally understand. Copyright infringement can be meaningfully distinguished from that thing. Cloning a thing is not the same as taking it.\nIt&#x27;s easy to fall into some meaningless etymological argument where nobody is right because words only mean what people understand them to mean. But if you&#x27;re trying to have a discussion about copyright, calling it theft clouds the issue when the discussion inevitably turns to the characteristics of copyright that distinguish it from physical goods.<p>I have no intention of making this an etymological argument. I use physical examples in reality to illustrate contradictions. By your statement cloning money is not a form of theft? Fine. Lets call cloning money what the government calls it: a crime. I can clone software, music and sell it for money. According to you, doing this however is not a crime, which is categorically wrong.",1451322363

These are my opinions/thoughts and don&#x27;t represent the company I work for at all.)<p>Windows has been harder to attack than OS X since Vista.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s changed--Apple is generally slow to correctly implement security features that require kernel changes compared to either the Linux devs or Microsoft.<p>If I remember correctly, OSX didn&#x27;t have a good ASLR implementation until 10.9 or 10.10, and has generally lagged behind on OS-level security updates and exploit mitigation (NX pages, ASLR, etc.).  It was routinely the first thing hit in the early Pwn2Own competitions (partly because exploits on it were a breeze, partly because the laptop was usually a little nicer and you only got the laptop back then, too--but also because moving from crash to reliable exploit was easier).<p>I haven&#x27;t followed security updates in Linux in the past few years as closely, so I can&#x27;t comment on it as knowledgeably.  From what I remember, it was about on par with Windows for difficulty to attack in Vista/7, but there&#x27;s been a lot of security features that Windows has added since then.  From what I remember, a fully hardened Linux box was just as bad to attack as a hardened Windows box, but Windows has generally required less configuration to get that right.

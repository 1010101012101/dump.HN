8314962,comment,8305283,8314131,1,0,pedrocr,,,"> My algorithm works with the nlink==1 optimization just as well: just don&#x27;t put those files into the file list that needs to be sorted, instead copy them immediately or put them into a list that doesn&#x27;t need sorting.<p>If you do that then your extra storage requirements are now O(paths to inodes with nlinks > 1) which is still strictly higher than O(inodes with nlinks>1). You&#x27;re also doing two passes, one to enumerate the files, another to do the copying and hardlinking, and doing an extra operation (the sort). I&#x27;d be very surprised if that was faster, and unless you have an on-disk sort it will still be RAM+swap limited instead of just disk-space limited.",1410692357

The more successful their software the more miserable and frustrated they become. I believe the best way of preserving your sanity in this case is just pushing back and allow others to take responsibility. Forks and pull requests exist for a reason. Chances are you&#x27;re using my open source library for your regular job in which case you (unlike myself) will actually get paid for your contributions.<p>@napsterbr: you don&#x27;t owe anyone anything. If there&#x27;s any obligation it runs the other way. Take a deep breath and enjoy the ride, long may it last.

8314948,comment,8313853,8313853,1,0,anon4,,,"Each time I read that I&#x27;m reminded of Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes can look at a person and tell you everything about them by just deducing facts from observable facts and cross-referencing what he knows. He can do that, because he&#x27;s exceptionally smart and knowledgeable, neither of which is illegal - you can&#x27;t forbid people from being smart and knowing things. Having a machine to do it for you, to me, is a natural extension of your mind, so I feel very much against outlawing a method of doing something, which would not be illegal if you could do it by being exceptionally smart.<p>Still, I really don&#x27;t want corporations to have such power over people. The difference between Sherlock Holmes deducing that I usually ride a bicycle to work and a computer system deducing that, is that the computer system then proceeds absolutely automatically to spam me with offers about bike safety gear and indiscriminately shares that information with third parties.<p>So perhaps the answer here is not to outright outlaw data collection, but to find a model where there is someone personally responsible for your data that will safeguard it and make sure it&#x27;s not misused.<p>Imagine a data bank institution, which collects and stores your data and then only allows a very limited access to it to certain parties. You sign up with a databank and pay a monthly fee for your account. Then, whoever wants to collect data from you uploads it to the databank&#x27;s servers, never stores it locally, and you have full access to it. Each party that collects data on you can access all the data they have stored on the databank&#x27;s servers, but not the data of some other party, without your permission, and you can always revoke sharing rights or just disallow someone to store data about you, effectively turning off data collection for them. It might also be a good idea to disallow parties that upload data to a databank to compute locally with that data. That is, if someone wants to perform some inference on the data they&#x27;ve collected, they upload a program to the databank, the databank runs it on their servers, subject to access controls that you can modify, and then they get back the results of that computation.<p>In this model you&#x27;re the one paying for the safety of your data and the people keeping it are making money not from giving it away, but from keeping it safe. And you can&#x27;t keep people&#x27;s personal data without being a registered and regulated databank.<p>So next time you sign up for a Target card, you give them your databank account number and have full control over your own data.",1410691482

8314939,comment,8311757,8312020,2,0,morsch,,,"I got 39. I found the test interesting in terms of sorting algorithms. Typically when we think of sorting stuff, the comparison function is deterministic and cheap.<p>In this case, it gets increasingly hard and even erratic to tell adjacent colors apart; essentially the comparison function is increasingly expensive and non-deterministic.<p>I wonder if that has any consequences for the &quot;optimal&quot; strategy. In my case -- and I suspect most people did it the same way --, I used a kind of two-way insertion sort: for each field, I first decided if it should move left or right, then moved it as far as it &quot;made sense&quot;. So I ended up with a list that got sorted from the outside towards the inside. In the end I had a few passes of &quot;bubble sort&quot;, checking adjacent pairs for correctness. This was when it got expensive and erratic. :)<p>It would be a fun experiment to have an algorithm sort the list (based on whatever sorting algorithm) and simply use the human as a comparison robot: display two hues at the same time and let the human decide which of the two is &quot;smaller&quot;. I&#x27;m sure you could easily measure and even predict the increase in &quot;expense&quot; (i.e. response time) and the increase in errors and ambiguity for close hues.<p>You could also do stuff like force the user to decide within a very short time, to determine if there&#x27;s actually an increase in accuracy when staring at a given pair for 10 seconds vs a 500ms &quot;hunch&quot; decision (or heck, 10 500ms hunches, still a two-fold improvement).",1410690947

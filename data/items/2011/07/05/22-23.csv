I hate to see someone (even myself) being ostracized or belittled for failing to understand a concept or get something right on the first try. It makes for a crap work environment and tends to sap any energy going into the project. While I can agree with some of the sentiments about ego being a good thing (i.e. ego inspires pride in one's work and self improvement), I don't think that's the point being made here. Instead, the goal is to make the work environment as transparent and friendly as possible. Anyone should be comfortable speaking to anyone whether it be for advice, conversation, instruction, or otherwise. Definitely a good principle to base your business upon.",1309906712

2731890,comment,2729664,2729664,1,0,pwhermanson,,,"In a graphic design or web design project, there is definitely a fine line between what the client can expect as an aesthetic outcome and what works functionally or is congruent with user-friendly/intuitive design principles.  The scope of any project can clearly define functionality requirements.  However, when it comes to aesthetic appeal, and ""beauty"" as Johan describes, the client and designer may not be on the same page.  As a professional, the designer should incorporate everything that was asked; this is not in question. There are problems with designers projecting their own will onto a project and it can take a negative effect on the client/contractor relationship.  But the problem at hand is when a client gets an idea of what the final product should be and this idea conflicts with the functionality requirements as outlined in the scope.  Several clients of mine have even changed their minds in the middle of the project and try to ""scope-creep"" their way out of the original concept to cover up the fact that they were not yet mentally prepared to start.  This is when the designer needs to believe in their knowledge and experience and be professional, firm and courteous.  I inform my client that I will complete the functionality requirements.  Any major changes that are made to the original concept will result in an amendment to the contract or a second contract.  Johan is absolutely right!  The client should know exactly what he/she wants their website/app/interface to do.  The client may suggest ways on which technologies to do it with and why.  The client may supply design layouts that appeal them.  The designer's job is then outlined and structured, yet they still have the freedom to use experience and professional opinions to construct the best possible product.",1309905756

As soon as I share something with my 'Friends' circle, they are emailed about it, and subsequently given the opportunity to sign up. I don't have to send them an invite.

2731783,comment,2731321,2731321,1,0,ajdecon,,,"The only meaningful answer for me is ""Linux server (via ssh)"".  I do primarily HPC-related work, and it's almost never useful for me to work on a machine that isn't at least connected to my compute cluster.  I suppose I could compile and test code on my laptop, but only my trivial tests could really complete with any speed on just 8 cores.  (I'm not bragging, btw: this is, in fact, tremendously annoying, and one of my ongoing side projects is building useful tests I don't need a 64-core cluster for.)<p>The physical keyboard I use most of the time is attached to a Dell laptop dual-booting Windows and Ubuntu, but 90% of the time the only thing I have up is a bunch of ssh sessions. All my development is done in vim, server-side.",1309903366

We ask the owners for features, but not all of them are adopted (or implemented as soon as we wish).  Eventually, some of us create companion products or services to scratch our respective itches.<p>I could possibly be convinced to adopt the feature you request if someone else were to implement it.  First, though, there are some additional factors to consider beyond my time (factors such as resource usage on my webhosting service and whether Hacker News would be cool with this level of site scraping.)",1309903366

In my head I think I even applied the idea to .xxx, .aero and what-not as well. Pretty much how I expect Libya to do whatever they want with the .ly domain.<p>This seizing of domains has been kind of the de-facto behavior for at least some five years by now. In my head this new policy does not change anything (don't run gambling sites on a .com domain etc?). Hell, I might even go as far as to say that it might be a positive thing if there was no such thing as a generic TLD. Most corporations registers all their domains globally anyway (whether that is good or bad is another story).<p>Not the most relevant Google query, but it takes the idea home, I guess: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=us+seizes+domain+2005"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=us+seizes+domain+20...</a> -- I didn't bother looking for older entries than that.",1309903284

I&#x27;ve seen this sentiment a few times, and I think it&#x27;s unfair to label it &quot;victim blaming&quot; and dismiss it.<p>There are two different reactions at work here. One is that people&#x27;s photos <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be stolen and re-distributed, and the other is that once you upload a photo to an online service, you <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> assume it&#x27;s still private.<p>Both can be true at the same time.<p>The first is an idealistic argument. In an ideal world, you could trust every online service and every person to do the right thing; you could flash a bunch of money around in a bad part of a foreign place and not get mugged; you could be a woman and wear revealing clothing without being subject to abuse. These are noble ideals.<p>The second is a pragmatic argument. In the world in which we currently live, as a practical matter you don&#x27;t want to trust online services and other people, and you should be careful about flashing money around in seedy unfamiliar places, and women get cat-called far too often.<p>They&#x27;re two different statements, and we shouldn&#x27;t assume that just because somebody argues from one means that they don&#x27;t believe in the other.",1410119812

There are many countries whose citizens will not challenge the authorities in any form or manner, because the systems give them no redress against any abuse of power. Even if they are rich the legal systems don&#x27;t exist. Witness Khordovsky and his problems with the Russian government.<p>In America these institutions exist, but the legislatures have turned them into revenue collecting bodies for the federal,state, local governments and the law enforcement bodies.<p>It is like law enforcement and the legal system have turned into feeding troughs for the whole band of officials involved in it.<p>If you are not rich enough to give your lawyer a fair share of what they steal from you, you are not getting it back. If you are rich enough they don&#x27;t bother stealing from you because they know you have the power to get it back.<p>This sucks. Apparently police and prison officers unions and PACS or whatever their called fund political campaigns which result in preserved or even bigger budgets for law enforcement, then turn around and use the increased income to fund the politicians next time around, to keep the cycle going (except Detroit), which results in more borrowing by the government from which the banks also get their share, pauperising future generations even more.<p>It is an interesting country.",1410119330

It&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;re on their second or third account, but context usually implies that they&#x27;ve just been using the site for around three years.<p>Ditto on Reddit. I was a regular reader of the site before it had comments. There&#x27;s a frequent complaint among Reddit&#x27;s users that it&#x27;s not as good as it used to be, and usually the reasons they give for that are all things that have happened in just the last couple or few years.

8282139,comment,8281256,8281845,2,0,TheOtherHobbes,,,"It&#x27;s an oversimplification to suggest that scales are based on the harmonic series. Many instruments have slight non-linearities in their overtones, and intervals that sound consonant aren&#x27;t usually mathematically perfect. E.g. pianos don&#x27;t even have perfect octaves. The major and minor scales seem to be based on very specific ratio sets, not on the general overtone series.<p>But 12TET has 12 tones for a very practical reason - instruments with more tones are difficult to build and damn near impossible to play, because human hands are only so wide and finger movements have limited precision.<p>There were experiments with more tones per octave back in the middle ages, but the idea never caught on because the musical benefits aren&#x27;t obvious. So 12TET is a &#x27;good enough&#x27; compromise between flexibility and expressiveness.<p>Performers on instruments with an infinite pitch range vary their pitches anyway. Intonation problems drive conductors insane, and the reality is that orchestral and choral pitches tend to drift slightly towards consonance and away from the nominal ET ratios.<p>Of course, with a computer you can do what you like.

The different paradigm of coding trains your brain in different ways which offer perspectives on problem solving that I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have considered.<p>Note that for the above effect, it is irrelevant what Lisp you choose. Yes, it also applies to learning any additional language, but because Lisp is a different breed altogether (as opposed to Fortran-derived languages), more value is to be had from the diversity.<p>I used to be a huge fan of Common Lisp (even wrote my own series of blogs on why I love it a few years ago) -- still use it in my daily work -- but I came to realize that it&#x27;s not perfect. There are many things that Clojure has improved upon, e.g. consistent accessor methods, shared immutable data structures vs copying, and probably many more once I dive deeper -- there&#x27;s a reason why  even pg started recommending Clojure over CL or Arc.<p>I&#x27;ve been coding in Common Lisp for about 3-4 years. Even the algorithm of my startup is written in Common Lisp. There are definitely moments of sheer joy when I switch back and forth between Javascript and Common Lisp. But also moments of annoyance... sometimes certain algorithms are just more naturally imperative, and CL makes it hard not to write recursive.<p>tl;dr learning a Lisp is highly recommended.

Whereas with standards like C99, Fortran 90, or ANSI CL, it&#x27;s quite common for people to write nontrivial standards-conforming programs that you can expect to run unmodified across implementations. Culturally the Common Lisp community also seems more interested in maintaining portability even when leaving the confines of the official standard, through the heavy use of compatibility layers like Bordeaux-Threads. The Scheme approach seems to be to just target a specific implementation, and share functionality across them on a case-by-case basis by porting libraries (which is sometimes trivial, and sometimes more involved). Hence CL has Quicklisp, while Scheme has a package repository per system.",1410116927

Compared with SWIFT, you only know <i>SWIFT</i> has received the message in real-time.<p>If the beneficiary bank can&#x27;t be contacted for what ever reason, the sending bank (FromBank) simply keeps on trying until the beneficiary bank (ToBank) are back online again.\nThe problem with DDoS is a valid concern, but given the banks Internet banking services are also accessed by the banks users via the Internet, they are already dependent on the Internet.<p>If you don&#x27;t need real-time messaging and if cost nor complexity is a concern, then you probably won&#x27;t find BankAPI interesting.",1410116885

It tries to fit all music into a rigid hierarchy of bands, albums, and tracks, a hierarchy which applied to a reasonable amount of popular music from the &#x27;70s to the &#x27;00s, and it makes me wonder if the designers of music players ever listen to anything else.<p>Suppose the song is a collaboration.

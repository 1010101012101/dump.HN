It looks like they&#x27;re already using HSTS.<p>I agree with everything you&#x27;ve said though, I&#x27;ve ranted about it on many occasions. The underlying problem is one of making changes <i>noticeable</i> (which is what HSTS and HPKP do for TLS). Ideally you want a way to isolate the sensitive components of the application (anything with access to plaintext or keys), and have them open sourced, vetted, and undersigned by respectable third parties. Unfortunately you can&#x27;t do this in practice today even in the traditional desktop or mobile app software models, which mostly sign only to prove authorship. In the browser it&#x27;s hard to see how it would be even be possible... an in-browser app/plug-in model like Chrome Store wouldn&#x27;t really help without a delayed update channel that gave any third party canary systems time to review and sign-off any changes. And ultimately you&#x27;re still going to be gluing your secure box to your insecure form controls.<p>Perhaps what we need is a system like Moxies Convergence or the EFFs SSL Observatory but for HTML and JS, because I don&#x27;t see &quot;JavaScript and HTML pinning&quot; really cutting it.<p>I don&#x27;t think any of these challenges make ProtonMail a mistake though. It&#x27;s certainly always going to be better than GMail, which <i>depends</i> on access to your  message plaintext for advertising, and therefore can never provide privacy.<p>[0] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning-21"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning-21</a>",1419594212

8798645,comment,8797068,8798219,0,0,olavk,,,"Among historians it is generally believed that there was a preacher called (something like) Jesus which was crucified by the Romans. But looking at the only available sources (the Gospels) it is not even clear that he claimed to be the Messiah. The gospels are clearly written by people who believed him to be the Messiah, but the quotations directly attributed to Jesus are quite ambiguous regarding the &quot;divinity&quot; of Jesus himself. Notably be appears much more &quot;divine&quot; in the latest gospel than in the earliest, so the divinity seem have been a development over time among his followers. Even if he did himself claim to be the Messiah, it is very different from claiming to be the Lord, since the Jewish concept of Messiah is a (blessed) human king, not a divine being. The concept of the trinity where Jesus IS God is a later concept, not even present in the Bible. And the &quot;Son of God&quot; thing is basically a cultural misunderstanding, because it means something different among Jews (where basically everybody are Gods children) and Greeks (where Gods like Zeus literally had half-human children with superpowers).<p>So apart from the Liar/Lunatic/Lord trilemma, there is the option &quot;A cult leader that didn&#x27;t really claim the be the Lord, but his followers came to believe that he was&quot;.",1419593159

I ported the code in the post to use that approach, and here&#x27;s what it looks like:<p><a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/U_CZG9IMZ6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/U_CZG9IMZ6</a><p>The main advantage of this approach is that, like with &quot;real&quot; sum types, you get compile-time checking that you&#x27;ve handled every case. It also seems to mesh better with Go&#x27;s interfaces, since there&#x27;s no need to introduce a dummy method so the interface can work as a tag.<p>On the other hand, bypassing Go&#x27;s type switch construct is a little disappointing, since the automatic casting in type switches makes the syntax pretty clean.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to see that having &quot;r&quot; as an assignable return value comes in handy here (since you can&#x27;t return from inside a lambda).

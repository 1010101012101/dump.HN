What you're talking about is increases in the relative value of one thing over another, e.g. the price of gas or stock goes up while the price of labor stays the same. But that isn't caused by printing money, it's caused by Peak Oil and concentration of wealth.<p>>There is no point for me to pay off my loan early besides what the government requires me to do.<p>You mean other than the fact that the interest rate on the loan (even subsidized loans) is likely to be higher than the risk-adjusted return on most investments?<p>There are two primary reasons to invest new income instead of paying off money you've borrowed at interest. The first is that you have an investment opportunity (like your own business) which you're confident can produce a higher return on the investment than you're paying in interest on the loan. The second is that you anticipate a significant probability that you'll need to spend the money in the short to medium future, and the interest rate on re-borrowing the money you've paid back will be sufficiently higher than the rate you have on the existing loan to absorb the relative gains you'll make by not paying loan interest in the interim.<p>Don't let ""low"" interest rates fool you -- they're low compared to unsecured and unsubsidized loans, but they're still high compared to the ROI you get from investing in typical index funds.",1350449792

We're currently at an impasse with regards to how to actually try and launch the company.<p>From everyone I've talked to (and from researching how the y-combinator and others work), I've been put under the distinct impression that the lean startup methodology is the most widely used and suggested. I'm the only person on the team that can do design and coding. My understanding is that I should code the site for free, in essence creating a minimum viable product that can be used to validate the venture concept itself.<p>The rest of my team, on the other hand, is under the impression that if we have mockups of how the site should look and a well-thought-out business plan, we can raise somewhere on the order of $50-100k to get it coded (and likely an equal or greater sum to market it) through either private investors or even VC/Angel groups.<p>So my question is this: in this day and age, how much capital can you actually raise for a website concept that hasn't a single line of code or a user?

4663163,comment,4660842,4662687,2,0,btilly,,,"If you do the linear function/notation thing right, the idea of a change of basis comes for free.  The basic idea is this.  Suppose that we have a linear function F between two vector spaces (which might be the same), and we have coordinate systems on the vector spaces (which might be the same).  Then we can take the elements of the first basis, v1, v2, ..., vn, and write out a matrix whose columns are F(v1), F(v2), ... F(vn) in the second coordinate system.<p>This matrix uniquely represents F.  The function F can be applied to a vector by writing out the vector in the first coordinate system, putting that on the right of the matrix, then doing matrix multiplication.  You get an answer in the second coordinate system.  And the operation of matrix multiplication turns out (if the coordinate systems match up) to be exactly the same as composition of functions.<p>(This is no coincidence, this relationship is the motivation for matrix multiplication being defined as it is.)<p>OK, with all of that mess, what is a change of basis matrix?  It is simply the matrix you get for the identity function going from one coordinate system to another.<p>Now in this case the matrix A = [[1 0 0] [1 1 1] [1 2 4]] is the matrix to change from the basis where a+bx+cx^2 is represented by [a b c] to the basis where it is represented by [a a+b+c a+2b+4c] (ie [p(0) p(1) p(2)]). Its inverse is the change of basis the other way.  And B = [[0 1 0] [0 0 2] [0 0 0]] is, of course, in the [a b c] basis the representation of the function d/dx.<p>Then A B A^(-1) represents change from pointwise coordinates to coefficients, then differentiate in coefficient coordinates, then change from coefficient coordinates back to pointwise coordinates.  (Remember, the matrices are applied right to left, so you do A^(-1) first.)<p>If you can keep that straight, you now understand change of basis matrices.",1350448444

4663118,comment,4661381,4662976,1,0,vacri,,,"Thanks for your article - a couple of questions. My background is that in the dim dark past I studied neuropsych and then worked as an EEG tech (mostly epilepsy screening with infrequent psych patients) for 4 years (2000-04) before going to work for the company that makes Synamps 2 :)<p>Now, I've only skimmed your method and results as I'm a bit flu-ridden and hence vague, but a couple of things popped out. The first is that you stated there was no control for medication. In our experience doing EEGs on folks on certain psych drugs, there was usually an increase in higher band activity (more beta, much less slow wave) - these drugs would create an unusual but not clinically abnormal EEG. It was rare to see such an EEG in someone not on those drugs.<p>The second is that for doing mathematical analysis on the EEG, I've had it trained out of me that resting EEG is okay to use. Some task, any task, no matter how easy, gives a more reliable baseline - since the EEG is quite dependent on arousal state, without a basic task, you don't have much control over whether the person is sitting there thinking about having a nap or highly alert and fretting over some unrelated item. For epilepsy you want them drowsy and nearly asleep as that lowers the bar for spike-and-wave activity, but unless a similar thing happens in schizophrenia and slowing, I'd think that doing a task would be superior to resting EEG.<p>I wonder if accounting for these issues might increase your hit rate? Like I said, I only skimmed the method and results, so I may have missed something that makes these points less relevant.<p>As an aside, the epileptic EEG sample looks really quaint and old-fashioned, since it has the curved needle-on-paper distortion. It doesn't need to be updated, it just looks like Ye Olde EEG to my eyes... :)",1350447213

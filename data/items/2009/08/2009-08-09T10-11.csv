Interesting question by the way.<p>Full disclosure of terms is a must I think, and a very rigorous process should be in place to handle these situations.<p>I firmly believe that even though the app store is clearly apples creation with great power comes great responsibility.<p>And when companies do not live up to their responsibilities (I think Apple has proven beyond reasonable doubt that they act in an arbitrary way) then they ought to be forced to do so.<p>People build their businesses on top of the Iphone app store ecosystem and they should have a reasonable expectation that their investment is not subject to some arbitrary action of Apple.<p>If Apple does not want that kind of oversight they have a simple solution available to them: Open up the app store for everybody and drop the review process other than to look for stuff that I would loosely class as 'malware'.<p>If your application is merely stupid, trivial or has been done a million times already that should not disqualify you. Even 'disgusting' stuff should be possible, who is apple to define what is disgusting and what is not.<p>As long as applications stay within the law there should be room for them in the App store, the only thing Apple could do to protect its brand in this respect is to categorize the applications or to cut the app store loose from the mother ship.<p>They're in a tight spot on this one, damned if they do and damned if they don't.

750618,comment,749932,750595,0,0,abalashov,,,"I think the reason the parent poster rendered that opinion has to do with the calculus - real or imagined - that stands behind Apple's particular choice of things to reject, and the common attributes that unite the sort of thing they tend to reject.  Or, at least, the stuff that's made the headlines lately.  It seems to have to do with things that allow you to use their devices more ""freely"" and/or do more and/or access more.<p>I don't think ""censorship"" is quite the correct term for that, but you can see where the idea arises that Apple is not just acting as a retailer that wants to sell certain products and not others in its store, but specifically wants to limit products that have to do with openness of information and freedom of use.<p>Whether you agree with that assessment or not, that's what drives people to use terms like ""censorship"" to describe it.",1249815131

I countered that point with this…<p>I believe Government should be allowed to force companies to define how they will act but not force companies to take any specific action.<p>In other words I believe the government should force Apple to define their acceptance criteria for the App store (e.g. give the specific reasons why apps would be rejected) in the same way they force food manufacturers to list their ingredients on the packaging.

750598,comment,750514,750514,0,0,abalashov,,,"Oversubscription is an interesting question that always came up in my ISP days.  It's also at the heart of a great deal of economic and engineering endeavours in telecommunications in general;  after all, the T1 circuit was developed as a means of time-division multiplexing interoffice trunk lines on a digital facility.  Oversubscription and contention is at the heart of everything.  I think the statement that it ""results in greater efficiency and lower overall costs"" doesn't really emphasise or do it enough justice;  it doesn't just increase efficiency somewhat or lower costs somewhat.  There's simply no way that an ISP can offer any amount of megabits/s to a residential user at the kind of price point that makes it affordable without gargantuan oversubscription.<p>I think this statement is a little misleading, though:<p>""This may sound egregious, but it’s really not. It’s a reflection of typical usage patterns on broadband networks.""<p>I don't think it's so much just usage <i>patterns</i> as it is the <i>nature of the traffic</i> - specifically, the bursty nature of the traffic.  I remember we were running a small local ISP here in Georgia and had about 180 DSL customers on 1.5down/256up or 3.0down/384up connections.  The resulting usage from these that was generated out of the back of the broadband aggregation router at peak was about 5 mbps.  It has to do with the statistical dampening that comes with the fact that packets - even in what looks to the user to be a relatively continuous data stream - just don't come flooding all at once.  The closest you could get to that is every user were literally making a huge download that maxed out their pipe, and even then, there's a lot more dampening than meets the eye.  Besides, that's just not the way people use their Internet connections.  Surfing over to this web page and looking at it for a few seconds, clicking on another link, etc. are all things that leave gigantic gaps of time in which other people loading other web pages get served, and depress the overall metric.<p>But the nature of the traffic really does matter, especially as applications get more diverse.  There are other economic factors at play in the oversubscription game.<p>Take, for example, one of the reasons VoIP is such a huge headache for traditional IP network operators.  It's not because it takes up a lot of bandwidth;  the canonical clear-channel, completely uncompressed codec is ITU-T G.711u/A, which is basically the packetised form of the quantised PCM data in a synchronous DS0 TDM channel;  64 kbit/s (8 kB/s) per call.  OK, OK, if you add Layer 2/link layer framing overhead it becomes more like 80 kbit/s if Ethernet is the encapsulation, and perhaps a little more with the encapsulation layers that go into typical aggregation and service delivery infrastructure for ADSL, which usually involves ATM/AAL5 for transport, L2TP tunnels inside it, and PPPoE sessions inside that.<p>The real issue is the packet-per-second throughput.  Normal data packets for application-level protocols like HTTP are full to the brim (meaning, the smallest MTU in the path minus headers, which on Ethernet is 1500) with payload, which is comparatively efficient.  But you can't buffer voice for long;  it introduces way too much delay for comfortable conversation, once you factor in the actual network latency as well.  Humans won't put up with much more than 100 ms round trip time.  So, you pretty much have to buffer just a tiny bit of audio and ship it right off.  Most VoIP infrastructure uses a packetisation duration of 10 to 30 ms, and 20 ms is canonical, more or less regardless of codec;  that means that every media packet contains 20 ms of audio.  That means ~52 packets per second.  In each direction.  So, over 100 PPS just for one conversation.  Times several hundred for a somewhat busy subscriber-facing voice edge.<p>Every packet requires a certain amount of overhead for a router (or firewall, or any other Layer 3 device) to process;  at the very least, the header must be inspected and some sort of forwarding decision must be made by consulting the routing table, not to mention any applicable ACLs, firewall rules, stateful NAT connection tracking, and other lookups.  While a lot of higher-end routers have ASIC-assisted hardware planes and CAM for doing a lot of this stuff, it's still a substantial additional CPU burden for every stream.  It's the same reason BGP has different (slower) convergence properties than a fast IGP like OSPF or EIGRP;  Internet core routers couldn't handle the amount of updates required to maintain a 250,000+ route table in an update scenario with the latter protocols.<p>The PPS requirements of VoIP have forced considerable backplane and CPU upgrades as routers strain to handle equivalent amounts of bandwidth that is split into a hundred times more chunks.  A router that can handle a clear-channel DS3's worth of conventional data traffic (~45 mbit/s) is very likely to fall over handling 45 mbit/s of VoIP calls without some serious horsepower investment.  Hardware firewalls are even worse.  And, of course, all this has serious QoS implications, since a media stream disrupted by the buffering and processing of a large packet - say, HTTP - on an aggregate level is going to result in jitter (arrival of media packets at an inconsistent temporal delta) and other things that make users cringe and whine about static.<p>Anyway, the point of this rant is that as applications diversify and more things converge in this world, more factors have to be taken into account than just bandwidth.  It's one of the reasons the various broadband operators have such an ambivalent attitude toward VoIP and video that isn't generated from their own gear (i.e. comes through their IP upstream, which they pay for by peak usage) and provisioned via dedicated facilities.",1249813012

750594,comment,750408,750564,0,0,jimmybot,,,"Wha...?  Wait a second.  The title for the link submitted is: <i>Vitamin D</i> slashes risk of cancers by 77 percent (2007)<p>If what you're saying is true, that calcium + vitamin D confers the greatest benefit, then the link title is still wrong.  But what in the study says that calcium + vitamin D conveys the greatest benefit?  (ie Vitamin D alone wouldn't convey as great a benefit)  It may be true, but it's not obvious from the article that was linked, and it's still not obvious from the original paper that you linked to.<p>The article and you are assuming that what is having the anti-cancer effect is the calcium, and the vitamin D helps you absorb the calcium, thus enhancing that effect.<p>First, I don't assume what you do, which is that supplementing calcium is always a positive.  Second, what if vitamin D has some action other than help you absorb calcium.  Even if I'm not an expert in this, I find it hard to believe that medical researchers have completely precluded vitamin D from having any action other than help your body absorb calcium, and if it alone helped prevent cancer, it may be really nice to know, especially if you don't want to be increasing your calcium.<p>I don't get the attitude.  I was talking about the information was provided by the article.  There may very well be a study about men 20-40 years old, of varying ethnic backgrounds, who take just vitamin D (no calcium) and it's found to decrease cancer versus control, but <i>that's not the information provided here by the article or the original study</i>.<p>Your point about actual vitamin D supplements on the market mostly coming with calcium suffers from the same logical problem.  The article headline (original or on HN) should tell me what exactly is decreasing the cancer risk, not some assumption about what consumers will end up buying and what they'll <i>likely</i> also end up supplementing with <i>additionally</i>.  If the conclusion had been vitamin D alone decreases the risk of cancer, do you think there wouldn't be manufacturers churning out pure vitamin D, without the calcium?<p>EDIT: Okay, parent has updated post.  I appreciate that you softened your tone.  Sure, I know it says that they aren't sure of the generality of the study in the article.  I think it's worth pointing out because again, there's that disconnect between the title and the content.  Title says ""TAKE VITAMIN D"" without qualification.  Article says different.<p>Responding to your new point about the generality of the study--if the requirements for men and women really are the same (I don't buy it), then why study post-menopausal white women in Nebraska?  I can see age for the cancer risk, but why not men, and why not of different ethnicities?  If you're going to tell me that post-menopausal white women 55 and older are more likely to be deficient in calcium and vitamin D, then well, maybe the effects are exaggerated and other groups don't need the supplementation.<p>PS Computational biology is cool, I did programming work in a bio lab trying to identify splicing sites back in undergrad.",1249812707

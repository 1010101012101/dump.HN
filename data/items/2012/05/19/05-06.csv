3995200,comment,3967550,3968227,1,0,fffggg,,,"No, it won't work. This is my area of expertise and I can unequivocally state that it is not possible to solve this problem on a unix system. The linker infrastructure does not exist, and here's why:<p>RPATH (or better RUNPATH) has intractable conflicts in library dependencies. For example, this cannot work for any application which uses dlopen() and packages its loadable modules independently of the invoking binary. This is a problem for very high profile software such as:<p>* Apache, and just about any other application server with a plugin interface\n * Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, and just about every other interpreted/VM oriented language<p>Furthermore, there exists other intractable conflicts in complex library dependency interactions.  For example:<p>bin/A needs SONAME=B.so.1 needs SONAME=C.so.1 (v1)<p>bin/B needs SONAME=D.so.1 which needs both SONAME=C.so.1 (v2, incompatible) and SONAME=B.so.1<p>The dependency relationship of every shared object in this chain are not static, and you cannot modify the invoking binaries (where RPATH must be set) every time an intermediate shared object changes its linking requirements. You also cannot guarantee ordering when a single node depends on multiple libraries -- the order of evaluation is non-deterministic. You might say this is a corner case, but you would be surprised when you try at scale. This is not a corner case.<p>Seriously, I understand everything about this. Can't be done. <i>You</i> feel free to try it out and see that it <i>doesn't</i>.",1337406812

Google+, for all its attempts to catch Facebook, does this and it makes me hate their service (e.g. create a Page on my desktop and love it, go to my iPad and find 90% of the Page's capabilities are simply missing).  Since I <i>know</i> the device can handle a normal web page, I am just angry when a site effectively hides itself from me.<p>A related ""feature"" is this assumption that there must be something wrong with me for using the web page: sites <i>constantly</i> popping up reminders that they have apps.  If I wanted the app I would have installed it.<p>The second problem is sites adding arbitrary restrictions.  Pinch-to-zoom is <i>awesome</i> until some bone-headed web site decides all by itself that its layout will <i>actively fight this</i>.  Less available screen space, broken scrolling, the list goes on.  You know what, I know what size I want my font to be, not you.<p>So please, web sites, fire your iPad ""optimizers"" and let your sites shine for what they are.  <i>Very few</i> web sites are truly similar to apps, so stop making them that way.",1337406758

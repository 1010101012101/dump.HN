If they've ponied up $10-20mil as a talent grab I can kind of see it.

But they've clearly been spending way too much time with it internally without showing it to real world users.<p>Expectation: clicking the play button on a song plays the song.<p>Suggestion: make all this ""queueing"" stuff be something you opt into, after deciding that you want it and learning how it's supposed to work.  Or at the very least add a second play button per song that actually plays the song.<p>EDIT: I just found the link to see the old interface, and despite the above, this new interface is a million times better.  The old interface was an empty box saying ""what song do you want to hear?""  I have no f'ng clue what song I want to hear.  I'm on your site so that you can show me some cool new music that I might want to hear.<p>Every link on that old interface leads to an empty screen saying basically ""go away, you uncultured, non-music-knowing-about person and don't come back until you've researched enough about music to add some songs to your collection.""  This new look comes across more like ""check out all this music.  It's all good, so come in and play around"".  Much better way to greet newcomers to your site.",1350553629

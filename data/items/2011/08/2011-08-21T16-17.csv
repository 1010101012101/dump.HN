For some reason it seems like writers (or maybe it's the fault of people funding TV/movies) can only imagine a future having to do with space and/or aliens. What about the future of internet, computers, and/or mobile devices?<p>I don't think it's a coincidence that Star Trek and so on emerged during the Space Race period. The public consciousness was very much focused on space travel. The fiction was well-timed then, but now?<p>I would gladly read a story or watch a show about the following:<p>- What happens when we have automated every last low-skilled job? Utopia? Chaos?<p>- What happens when every single action is recorded about your daily life? Crime-free paradise? Totalitarian nightmare?<p>- What impact would a computer super-intelligence have?<p>I'm just going off the top of my head here. I'm sure some writers can come up with better stuff than this.<p>TL;DR: Space was a hot subject during the Space Race. Now, though, it's time to see some science fiction address the future of other technologies that we are now approaching. If the tomorrow project does that, I'm all for it.<p>Update:
I followed the link to Cory Doctorow's story Epoch in arethuza's comment. This in turn brought me to the full book With a Little Help.

2909480,comment,2909101,2909101,33,0,patio11,,,"Tips from Thomas, which I have used to the benefit of clients and myself:<p>1)  Any worthwhile developer sounds expensive when you break it out as an hourly rate, so don't.  Charge a weekly rate tied to specific business goals which you think you can accomplish within one week, two weeks, three weeks, etc.  If your client wants to dicker, dicker over scope, don't dicker over rate.  Dickering over rate will hurt all your further business with that client.  If e.g. $21,000 is too much for the budget, tell them what they can get for $14,000 and let them make the call on whether $7,000 is worth not getting $DIFFERENCE.  Whether it is or isn't, it doesn't chisel anything out of your <i>next</i> engagement with them.<p>An amazing truth about the world: $X00 an hour is a lot of money, but $X00 * 160 for something which makes a meaningful difference to the bottom line of a real company is cheap at the price.  Their pricing anchor will be other strategic initiatives rather than e.g. ""You make more than I do!""<p>2)  You bill on a time and materials basis.  Basically, my best estimate is that one week of work gets you $FOO and $BAR.  What you actually have at the end of the week is what you are due at the end of the week.  If you change your mind on scope for $BAR in the middle of the engagement and it doesn't get done in the week, that's OK, subject to availability you can buy another week.<p>3)  The basic offering is ""A contiguous block of my time starting at a mutually convenient date in the near future.""  Things which add business value on top of that cost extra.  Want to start working next week?  Sure.  Costs extra.  Want to split the engagement into two parts?  Doable.  Costs extra.  Want support?  Wonderful.  Costs extra.  Want support with an SLA better than ""Best effort to answer emails within a day""?  Costs extra.  Travel?  Extra, and you reimburse costs as per your company's usual travel policy.   (If I had heard that line a year earlier I would be five figures richer to the detriment of exactly no one.  Doh.)",1313943405

One of my ideas in this space is a bitcoin like system that maintains a public ledger of contracts you've entered into and completed as verified by a variety of sources.  People could supply their public key allowing you to check their reputation history and sign contracts with their private key.",1313942667

It's completely fine to use different editors, as it is fine to keep developing web applications in php and not trying things like ror/django/node.js/nextbigframework, or never learning a lisp dialect.<p>But in all cases, just learning them will most likely improve your skills in many ways. Maybe you won't change from textmate to vim or emacs, but you will pick up many things from them that I believe will make your life easier.",1313942600

Sure, you may get a response (and even the same content), but that's no guarantee that <i>the domain you used</i> is configured for SSL on the server. An IDS may flag the request as a potentially malicious probe and temporary block the IP address from accessing some resources. This can be extremely useful for blocking exploit attempts by drive-by bots that request by IP address alone. Of course, it would be strange to continue to allow access to the SSL resource as in your example, but maybe there's a reason for it (server admin has different goals than site admin, for example). Just one possible explanation. You might regain HTTP access if you stop hitting HTTPS for a while.<p>Edit: The CN in the cert is news.ycombinator.com, so it's unlikely my explanation is the cause (but still could be).",1313942510

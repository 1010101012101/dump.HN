It doesn&#x27;t take a PHD to see that we&#x27;ve moved beyond what the original platform was designed to do. It was designed for documents and styling those documents, but very little of what we do today is making documents. Webapps are king now and designing them means having to work around this outdated platform built for documents. It&#x27;s so bad that now we require books such as JavaScript the Good Parts to explicitly tell us how to avoid these warts.<p>Instead of iterating further on HTML I think a new open platform should be built that specifically targets interactivity and building applications.

If the universe sucks people can change everything. If you hate the mopho stack (mongo and php), that&#x27;s ok, you got other options.<p>With the browser everyone is stuck with one universe. The only thing that changes are front end frameworks which offer some flexibility. Still, if html sucks we&#x27;re stuck with it. If you hate html or javascript then you hate the entire front end. You exist outside of that universe because Nothing can change it. End of story.<p>I don&#x27;t know how it could be done while keeping things secure, but it would be awesome if the browser universe was as flexible as the backend. If I could swap between html and any other kind of media based declarative language as easily as I can swap between python and ruby on the backend, it would change the face of frontend development and make it more accessible. In fact what if I wanted to develop my own language that interfaces with the rendering engine?

This happened in the United States and to some extent in Ireland. This type of colonialism is usually terrible for the natives.<p>Type 3 is where the colonizers install themselves as a ruling caste, but otherwise let the natives be. They extract taxes and provide governance in return. This was the case in India. It was also the case when the Normans invaded England, the Spanish invaded Mexico, or the British took over India.<p>Type 3 often works out better for the natives, because the existing regime had to be pretty backward and corrupt in order to fall to a small band of foreigners.

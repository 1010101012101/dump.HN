Is there a hook on import that detects the file in which it&#x27;s imported, searches for the # coding language pragma line, and then actually alters the text of the source code before the Python interpreter resumes parsing the rest of that file?<p>Initially I thought this was something like James Powell&#x27;s &quot;astexpr&quot; literals example (towards the end of < <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O7yj-Nh6AY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O7yj-Nh6AY</a> >), which would require actually implementing a new C-API type, adding parser logic for its literals, and recompiling Python.<p>If you can add a comment or two to clear up my confusion, I would really appreciate it.<p>Great work on this!",1448395198

I think everyone agrees there is a much longer &quot;grace period&quot; before those resources would be depleted than there is for even the slowest of hypothesized AGW scenarios. So if accelerating the depletion of uranium (ha) would solve the more pressing issue then it makes sense.<p>Perhaps your concern is that people would get complacent with what can only be a temporary solution (even if temporary means thousands of years), but if AGW is regarded as an urgent and critical problem to solve, I don&#x27;t think you can afford to ignore the opportunity.<p>> Currently we have about 200 years of uranium available for economical extraction.<p>In that 200 years a whole lot more uranium will become available for economical extraction, exactly the same as what happened with oil and natural gas.",1448394979

The book is considered by some to be the Inner Game Of Tennis[2] of today. But one of the concepts in Mindset that they say even the top guys can mess up is that if you are in a negative state of mind, you must give yourself a trigger word, or some sort of positivity before restarting your concentration. In other words, if you are telling yourself, &quot;I am playing like crap. Wah Wah.. Ok, now concentrate!&quot; You are likely to fail. However, if you are able to stop yourself, or correct yourself and say, &quot;run run run.&quot; Then start concentrating, you are more likely to succeed. In relation to the article, quiet eyes are only as good as the mindset behind them. (I hope that made some sort  of sense). But it basically means you need to have the right mindset before you start concentrating.<p>The run run run is from an example in the book. I noticed when the Detroit Red Wings were on a losing skid this year players had &quot;skate skate skate&quot; written on the tape of their stick.

10623084,comment,10621305,10621305,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Like anything with a political undertone, how recidivism rates are calculated is defined by the messenger. A politician wanting to take a hard nose approach to crime is going to want a higher recidivism rate so he/she can say that keeping people in prison reduces crime. On the flip side, the reality is that by providing jobs, education, and general opportunities, upon release there is a less chance that someone will recommit.<p>The real problem, as someone else pointed out, is that in most cases the individual is set up to fail in the justice system.<p>I will use myself as an example. I served a one-year supervised felony probation. On the last day of my probation I was cleared by my probation officer. Although technically my probation did not end until midnight, when I met with my probation officer in the morning she gave me a letter stating I had met my obligations and at midnight would be clear from further supervision. I had been planning a move out of the state the following day and in preparation had rented a moving van and was beginning to pack my things. With the van parked in front of my house, an overzealous sheriff deputy who knew I was on probation, stopped to see what was going on. Simply because I had already begun packing the van, he decided he would violate my probation for moving without permission. I was arrested again for a violation and subsequently spent the night in jail until a judge released me the following morning. Luckily my attorney was able to convince the state not to press for additional time and my probation was terminated. It cost me a little over $1000 in additional legal fees (or as my attorney so eloquently put it, do you want me just to play golf with state&#x27;s attorney or take him to dinner afterwards) for my attorney to handle that for me. I was fortunate enough to be able to afford the costs, however, I have seen first hand how others without the means would have been violated and most likely would have served time or an additional length of probation resulting in additional costs.<p>While someone else pointed out that high incarceration rates are not entirely to blame on the war on drugs, they are directly related. We live in a society where zero-tolerance laws take precedence over common-sense laws. We incarcerate people at the highest rate in the world. The system is like a giant ponzi scheme. We incarcerate so many people that we have to charge outrageous court and other fees to afford to support the cycle of incarceration. Yet the failure to pay these same fees are often one of the leading reasons that people are violated on probation or parole. We have people serving mandatory sentences for charges that in today&#x27;s society are no longer crimes. However, if a politician attempts to make a change and get those individuals released they are viewed as being soft on crime. An interesting study would really be a comparison of fees paid to sentence served. I know I was able to essentially pay more in fees to reduce my probation time. Similar to getting a mortgage and paying points up front to reduce your interest rate.",1448394279

When we get a big electricity bill, we take a closer look and perhaps rely less on our heaters or air-conditioner.

There&#x27;s thousands of examples, many of which have an impact our our environment.<p>So if we focused on developing a tool whose sole purpose was to give us quantified feedback on the consequences of our actions - much like how we use utility bills - we might be able to make a real dent in the big problem of climate change and others like it.

(Technically, you could simulate X years of real-world cosmic ray exposure in X/N years by testing N sets of RAM in parallel, but then that requires you to have more ram under test than you give to your customers!)<p>All the same, I&#x27;m sure more mundane explanations are behind the vast majority of errors, as you say.",1448393512

Nash Jr.). For one such coffee hour, in February 2004, I came thinking—for the hundredth time\nin my life—about the network of evenly spaced parallel lines cutting a\ntriangle into small congruent triangles. This time I dealt with equilateral triangles, and the crux of the matter was a demonstration that n2 unit\ntriangles can cover a triangle of side n. I asked myself a question where\nthe continuous clashes with the discrete: what if we were to enlarge the\nside length of the large triangle from n to n+ε, how many unit triangles\nwill we need to cover it? This comprised a new open problem:\nCover-Up Problem 1. Find the minimum number of unit equilateral\ntriangles required to cover an equilateral triangle of side n + ε.\nDuring the next coffee hour, I posed the problem to a few Princeton\ncolleagues. The problem immediately excited John H. Conway, the John\nvon Neumann Professor of Mathematics. From the commons room he\nwent to the airport, to fly to a conference. On board the airplane, John\nfound a way (Figure 1) to do the job with just n2+2 unit triangles! (Area\nconsiderations alone show the need for at least n2 + 1 of them.) Conway\nshared his cover-up with me upon his return—at a coffee hour, of course.\nNow it was my turn to travel to a conference, and have quality time on\n28\nMathematics Competitions Vol 23 No 1 2010\nan airplane. What I found (Figure 2) was a totally different cover-up\nwith the same number, n2 + 2 unit triangles!\nUpon my return, at a coffee hour, I shared my cover-up with John\nConway. We decided to publish our results together. John suggested\nsetting a new world record in the number of words in a paper, and\nsubmitting it to the American Mathematical Monthly. On April 28,\n2004, at 11:50 AM (computers record the exact time!), I submitted our\npaper that included just two words, “n2 + 2 can” and our two drawings.\nI am compelled to reproduce our submission here in its entirety.",1448393321

They&#x27;re paying you to take a ticket. That ticket then gives you an option to ride an airplane. Ticket use is not mandatory, not even ethically.<p>If it were somehow advantageous for the airline to actually have people take the trip from B->C, then they could pay people to actually do it by, for example, giving you a rebate when you step off the airplane at C, or charging you a fee for not boarding the airplane at B.

Do you think knowing &quot;x&quot; is type &quot;Foo&quot; tells you anything about what you can do with &quot;x&quot;, other than use it where you can use &quot;Foo&quot;s? You need to figure out what you can do with &quot;Foo&quot; by reading the docs around &quot;Foo&quot;. Yeah, I know a priori I can call a method on Foo that returns an int and pass that to other int-taking methods, but is that what I want to do? Which method returning an int do I want to call? You need to look at what &quot;Foo&quot; is to determine this. Rich&#x27;s example is HttpRequestServlet in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdnJDO-xdg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdnJDO-xdg</a> I&#x27;d recommend watching that and ignoring me. A lot of the issues he raises, as contextfree points out, are around OOP rather than static typing in general so take these as my views and not necessarily his...<p>If &quot;Foo&quot; is just dynamic data, perhaps in a map, composed of other data, and it&#x27;s values all the way down, any of those three points of time are easy ways to look at &quot;Foo&quot; and can generally be faster than reading a JavaDoc page or ctrl+spacing figuring out what you have access to and what it all means and what you want to do with the data and code associated with &quot;Foo&quot;. Since you&#x27;re going to be looking at the thing you want anyway, I find it very uncommon in practice that I accidentally divide a string by 2. Static typing would let me know before I run the thing that I was an idiot (maybe, see next paragraph), but I&#x27;ll find out almost as quickly when the code I just worked on (either in the REPL, which is very nice, but even from the starting state) actually does what I want -- you do that regardless of static/dynamic typing, right? You don&#x27;t just write code and never verify it does what you want, trusting that it compiled is good enough? Anyway when I run it, I&#x27;ll immediately hit a runtime error (which can be handled in Lisp in ways way more flexible than exceptions in other languages) and realize my stupidity. So I don&#x27;t find that particular situation or class of bugs very compelling.<p>Nor do the presence of declared types alone guarantee my safety -- I need to know about any conversion rules, too, that may let a String be converted to an int for division purposes, or if there is operator overloading that could be in play. Conversion rules and operator overloading are interesting regardless of the static/dynamic typing situation because too much or too few can lead to annoyances and bugs. Java lets you concatenate ints into strings with &quot;+&quot;, Python doesn&#x27;t, but Python lets you duplicate strings with &quot;*&quot;.<p>What I have run into in both static and dynamic languages is division-by-zero errors, which, unless you go all the way to something like Shen that supports dependent typing, your type system with &quot;int&quot; declarations will not help you with. I&#x27;ve run into errors (in both static and dynamic languages) parsing string contents to extract bits of data. I&#x27;ve run into errors around the timings of async operations. I&#x27;ve run into null pointer exceptions (though much less frequently in dynamic languages, maybe once the Option type is in wider use I can rely on that too but its issue is poisoning the AST). I&#x27;ve run into logic errors where I thought the system should be in state C but instead it transitioned to state E. The bugs that take the longest to diagnose and fix are simply due to not understanding the problem well enough and having an incorrect routine coded, so I have to figure out if it&#x27;s a logic error or an off-by-one error or simply using the wrong function because it had a suggestive name and I didn&#x27;t read through the doc all the way. Rich made an interesting point in one of his talks that all bugs have both passed your type checker (if you have one) and your test suite. My point is that I&#x27;m not convinced static typing as I&#x27;m given in the languages I work in is worth it for any reasons beyond performance because I don&#x27;t see any other improvements like making me more productive or writing less bugs. I&#x27;m not opposed to types and schemas themselves in general, just static typing. I&#x27;d rather see pushes towards full dependent typing and systems like TLA+ (which has seen more industry usage than Haskell) and Coq than things like core.typed in Clojure.<p>The last point I&#x27;d raise is that I agree with you developer efficiency is more important than code efficiency. But this has been one of the mainstay arguments from the pro dynamic typing camp for many decades, with static typing advocates conceding that yes the developer will be more productive in a dynamic language but the performance is terrible for anything serious. If you want to argue static typing was actually more efficient all along from a developer perspective than dynamic typing, you have a lot of work to do. I&#x27;m not particularly interested in that argument (at least today) but the point still needs to be raised.",1448392788

For another, SpaceX&#x27;s landing attempts have been on a barge, not flat land, which means that targeting is a much harder problem.  (The latter is speculation on my part, but the New Shepard booster went through a lot of gymnastics just before landing; that sort of thing can be a whole lot easier if you just have to wind up level with zero velocity, without having to target a particular spot on the ground as an added constraint.)<p>EDIT: some observers claim that the New Shepard is hovering.  If so, that does two things: first off, it indicates that either the stage is ballasted, or Blue is taking advantage of their engine&#x27;s <i>very</i> deep throttle range.  (SpaceX&#x27;s first stage can&#x27;t hover, as even fully throttled-down thrust of one engine exceeds weight of the stage at landing; so long as an engine is firing at all, the stage is accelerating up.)  Second, it obviously makes the targeting problem much easier.  (Note that the ballast could just be extra fuel; they&#x27;ve clearly got extra to burn in the landing maneuvers...)",1448392223

The big benefit over kafka-python is that PyKafka supports multi-consumer groups that balance consumption via ZooKeeper with its BalancedConsumer interface.

This includes ensuring that the existing consumers work against the updates to the 0.8.2 consumer API as well as implementing support for the new consumer API introduced in 0.9.

Okay, I had lost this chance. But what could I learn for the next time?</i><p>Why have we (as candidates) allowed ourself to become so brow-beaten over the years as to nearly always conclude that if an employer fails to read us, that it&#x27;s automatically because of something <i>we</i> did to &quot;blow it&quot;?  That we&#x27;re the ones who need to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves of, and wallow through a necessary period of mourning and self-reflection before promising ourselves to do better next time?<p>Long, painful lesson learned:  <i>it&#x27;s a two-way street</i>.  The interviewers&#x27;, and the company&#x27;s overall performance in the process is just as much open to evaluation -- and question -- as that of the candidate.  And guess what -- they&#x27;re just as likely to make mistakes as the candidate; perhaps even more so -- because they&#x27;ve internalized the idea that as the one on the hiring side, they&#x27;re the ones with X-ray vision to what determines a &quot;perfect fit&quot;; so that if turns out the candidate doesn&#x27;t hit all the markers they&#x27;re looking for, then by definition, it&#x27;s because something the candidate did to screw everything up.<p>In this case, it looks like it may have been the company which &quot;blew it&quot; in passing on this guy.  Or maybe not -- we have no way of telling from this distance, and it would be moot to speculate.  But I would like to hope that we can get past this tendency to automatically beat ourselves<p>As an aside -- aren&#x27;t logic problems &quot;over&quot; now, for any but junior positions?  Even for senior developers I&#x27;d consider them something of a red flag -- a sign that the company doesn&#x27;t really know why it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s doing in the hiring process, and is cut-and-pasting from what it thinks other companies are doing.<p>And at the VP level?

The well established research paradigm in language design would have\nme identify a deficiency in the expressiveness of some class of languages and\nthen propose an alteration of these languages which arguably removes the defi-\nciency. However, there already is several decades’ worth of such contributions,\nsuggesting two much more pressing questions. How does one compare design\nalternatives that are present in the literature? And the question I focus on in this\ndissertation: How does one use the existing literature to aid in language design?</i><p>I cannot overemphasize the importance of being able to compare the merits of programming languages <i>without taking sides</i>.

The fair.io site doesn&#x27;t make it clear and based on what they do say, I&#x27;d be extremely hesitant to make anything more than casual use of software under this license.<p>It seems to me, based on the information on fair.io that I can simply fork the project, offer enterprise licenses for $0.01, or heck, make a fork for my company which is identical to the original but has my logo on it and charge my company $0 for licensing... is there any prevention of this that I&#x27;m missing? IANAL but this legal portion here looks flimsy and lacks important definitions, especially with regards to protections from stuff like that.",1448391745

For instance, if a tenant stops paying rent, the landlord can&#x27;t evict that tenant for 6 months. This sounds nice--helping someone in need instead of the greedy landlord--but the overall effect is largely negated (as usual, the market seems to always adjust when you mess with it). It&#x27;s now MUCH harder to get an apartment in New York in the first place. You need a large income, guarantors, or lots of savings, in addition to credit checks, bank staements, tax statements, etc. I&#x27;m pretty sure the same people that the law was meant to help are now unable to rent in the first place.<p>One idea I have is, instead of messing with the free market, create a futures exchange whereby renters and landlords can lock in rent. This market is possible because there are just as many people concerned about rent going up as there are rent going down.<p>If you want to keep renting, but you don&#x27;t want to hedge yourself via the futures market or via buying a place, you&#x27;ll just have to accept the risk that you&#x27;ll be priced out of your neighborhood someday.",1448391677

Used to working on-demand anywhere and anytime, gig economy freelancers expect the same kind of flexibility and focus from the vendors who provide the picks and shovels of their often-blurred personal and professional lives.</i><p>Author is confusing the &quot;gig economy&quot; w/ the &quot;as a service&quot; business model.<p>The &quot;gig economy&quot; refers to changes in the composition of the labor force and the different types of contracts that are becoming the norm between employer/employee. Uber treats its drivers as quasi employee contractors who have more flexible work schedules but do not get the traditional benefits of a salaried employee, and generally need to provide their own capital (vehicle).<p>The &quot;as a service&quot; model refers more to the vendor/customer relationship where customers are coming to expect more flexibility and subscription services rather than outright purchases of goods and services. You buy a monthly subscription for server space and compute power rather than a dedicated server room w/ IT staff & sysadmins. Then you layer on security, analytics, dev management, mobile, testing tools as needed. In the gym example, you buy the bare bones subscription package and add towel service, snacks, earbuds, other privileges as you see fit.<p>Both buzzwords that do an adequate job of describing new business models, but the author confuses the concepts and kind of fumbles around, naming different companies that could be vaguely associated w/ pioneering either one.",1448391654

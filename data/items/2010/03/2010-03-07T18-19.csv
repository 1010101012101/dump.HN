Instead he started off with a lot of excuse-making, then went into a list, but kept deviating from the list to talk about video games (which, I guess, should have been the topic?)<p>It had the feeling of a long list of grievances strewn together, ranted about, and then tacked on to a couple of other conversations.<p>The strength of the article was in the negative first-person impressions of Japanese culture. He should have stuck with that, cut out the apologizing and made that just a sentence or two at the end. Then he should have tightened the hell out of the prose and tried to make some kind of thesis that his stories supported.<p>Other that that, the first-person stuff was good.

Case in point our local newspaper, which requires a subscription to read content other than the classified ads.  If you are not a subscriber, all you get are the headlines and a ""teaser"" sentence.  Because the local news published here is not generally available on wire services or other sources, there is not really an alternative to paying for this content if you want it (other than buying a physical copy of the paper itself).<p>It's really a question of the value of your content.  If enough people are interested in it that you can make significant money with ads, you probably could also get people to pay for it directly.  I think micropayments per individual piece of content would make the most sense here, i.e. I'm a lot more likely to pay $0.10 to read some interesting sounding thing than I am to commit to a much more costly paid subscription to your site.",1267985292

At minimum they are certainly quite clean and non-intimidating, which is the opposite of what I think you would expect from a company which ""executed [their] UI like an engineer""<p>In terms of mobile I would agree that the Android demos don't look quite as slick as the iPhone, but give it some time before it is released.",1212533934

In general I think it's hard to find some one with an application portfolio though. Most are advertisement websites and it can be hard to gauge if their portfolio match your values.<p>Most UI jobs I see are either salary or long term contract. but I might be biased as that is what I look for.",1212533744

But personally I think the people applying also expect a better wage\price to come with that. For companies to attract truly the best UI designers I do think they have to pay a bit more for them. Though there are plenty of young cheep talent out there. They perhaps are not the best.",1212533492

208413,comment,208230,208382,0,0,STHayden,,,"""there is very little correlation between price and quality"".<p>to a point. While design can often have a rang of price there can be a clear difference between paying some one a living wage and not. This number can vary international but it's good to know what is considered a professional wage abroad.<p>Also price can have a high correlation to experience. More experience is good if you care about the details but many rather stay cheap.<p>the design field is changing and there is a lot of price fluctuation and it can be hard as a company to gauge if a company is worth the price. But to say there is little correlation is a little misleading.",1212533339

Do your own thing instead of listening to your clients huh?  Sounds like bread winning advice!<p>Sarcasm aside, I agree to a certain degree with the parent post - We do work for individual clients and design selection is their choice, since, <i>drumroll</i>, thats what they are paying us for!  You can definitely help them out with suggestions, but ultimately your job is to make the client happy - If you are running your own company (or consulting) servicing clients, I'd say that is doing your own thing.",1212533199

208407,comment,208229,208229,0,0,richesh,,,"Option 1 - seems like an easy way out, and would probably negate your experience so far since ""big companies"" might not value your skills.<p>Option 2 - is very hard to do unless you have an idea that the community really really needs.<p>In my opinion you two other options:
Option 3 - try to expand your company by getting project contracts and not hourly contracts and get a decent size project to hire a partner, then go from their hire as you find more projects. (this is harder than I make it sound here, but worth it).<p>Option 4 - Come up with 10 ideas that you think you can develop within 40-80 hours (2 weeks) using cakePHP, this is the 6 month road. If any one of these generate enough ads revenue to allow you to not do client work all the time then it will give you time to think about what to do ""next"". You can then try to hire more employees, grow your business, go back to school, or even join a big company.",1212533059

208404,comment,208229,208229,0,0,lux,,,"Use Cake to build an app that you can sell online as a service.  If the service takes off, there's all kinds of opportunity for learning as it grows and technical requirements change (scalability, security, etc).<p>I've been doing client work in my one company for years (7 to be exact) and while it's an okay model for making a living, the revenue is connected with the hours you put in, which to be honest sucks.  It means you can grow by adding people or becoming a bit more efficient, but neither of those allows for exponential growth.  As such, it's not the right model for startups.<p>Instead, you want something where you make residual income every month off something like subscriptions.  With that type of model, you make steady income (if you can sell it) and there's the potential for exponential growth without exponentially increasing the number of people involved.<p>As for ideas, most software you can write that you install on your own server (Cake type stuff) can be made as an on-demand service as well.  And most jobs that are done in a consultancy can also benefit from software to make those jobs more efficient.  I say pick one and go for it!",1212532703

We are willing to pay up to $5000 or maybe even more for this service, but it has to be good and the chance of someone getting it wrong or asking for double the money is what's keeping us from taking the plunge.<p>But I digress, the point of this comment is to try out 99designs.com. I've seen some really good designs on that site if you know exactly what you want.<p>We plan on experimenting with 99designs once we have our site up and running with UI we can come up with as developers and hope to get lucky!",1212532456

In an internal email, Compensia (a human resources consulting firm retained by Yahoo) President Tim Sparks had this to say about the plan: “That’s nuts“.</i><p>So if Yahoo were to be bought everyone with any talent who presumably would not want to work at Microsoft would immediately vest and leave?

208399,comment,208152,208152,0,0,petervidani,,,"The reasoning behind the separation in these steps is for 2 reasons:<p>To save time on both halves.  That is, the designer is designing his/her piece without worry of the difficulty, and the programmer is designing the framework without worry of user intuitiveness and style.<p>It so often occurs that the designer and the programmer have slightly different ways of thinking.  Each party has separate concerns for the final product, and each half should be individually thinking about the future of their work and how each can be maintained.<p>This article may certainly apply to, and almost addresses, a programmer without a sense of concern for the user's experience and general usability.<p>As a front-end designer, I need the mockup process for my own sake even more than for the sake of the final product.  Personally speaking, if I were to attempt complex mockups without first laying out a grid and carefully choosing my color palette, I would quickly be overcome with the duties of writing the code, and the hundreds of short-term problem solving that would arrive.  My passion is never to become a flawless programmer, but it is to flawlessly design an intuitive interface.  When I am creating a mockup in photoshop, what I'm doing in my head is pretending.  I imagine over and over again that I am a first time user to the site, and maybe even to the internet.  This duty is daunting enough without having concern over how I will make it work.<p>Again, this article may whisper sweet nothings to a programmer on a tight schedule, but I can guarantee you that the time to simply layout a grid and pretend will save you the time it takes to just load the monster application.  And I don't know about you, but I cannot imagine a site's usability on a simple piece of paper.",1212532158

In many startups, shipping buggy software is a trivial danger compared to the risk of spending too much time carefully wringing the bugs out of software that nobody will use and that will never make any money.<p>In that context, when someone says ""you should <i>ship it right now</i>"", what they really mean is ""you should test the market before wasting any more time polishing the product"".<p>Obviously, the IT department of a brokerage firm is a much different environment.

The smartest mathematicians and physicists often invent their own funny little diagrams for doing calculations---it's a real pity these usually don't make it into print.

If one human is as deserving as another then you shouldn't mind when I redistribute your ill-gotten wealth to myself.<p>""Deserving"" is a red herring.  People ""deserve"" to be happy and the whole nine yards.<p>There are <i>practical</i> reasons why you would want to keep up the economic infrastructure around the area where you live.  The standard of living you enjoy depends on the standard of living of people around you.  The majority of crimes are crimes of poverty.

Comfortable, fun to bounce around on while thinking, and does wonders for your back. Plus, at £7 from your nearest Tesco, the price point is most definitely startup-compatible :)",1208614267

Currently, I need about 1500€/mo of income to break even. I'm not shooting for a 5x like VC's do. My next investment will probably be in graphic design because I've got an ugliness problem.<p>But the motivation is clear : I don't want a boss to feed me anymore, I live in a tiny town where (interesting) IT work doesn't exists, going back to the big town far from the beach is a last resort option.<p>Why I don't recruit a team : I'm not a team player, and we will spend most of the time dealing with my behavior and I'll get singled out in a short time.",1208614245

Server farms, international markets, maybe Akamai.<p>But in general, it's not uncommon for companies that raise a lot of capital for rapid growth to not be profitable. Back in AOL's heyday, they had huge revenue growth, but they were reinvesting it in customer acquisition so fast that they never started to make money until their growth slowed down. This also happened in the retail boom in the 80s with companies like Home Depot and Staples. They kept building out more stores, which cost them more money than they were making.<p>Having said all that, I really fail to understand valuing Ning at half a billion dollars. It seems like a useful thing, but only an incremental improvement over, say, Yahoo Groups.",1208613978

On one of my previous startups, we wanted to look at funding, but basically found that without connections and revenue in boston, the number of team members didn't make much difference. The amount we would have looked for fit right in with pg's missing funding niche article.<p>Keeping motivated has never been a problem for me, since this is <i>what I like doing</i> to a scary extent. The bigger problem is staying off HN.<p>Pros:<p>-No founder disagreements (what killed my last startup).<p>-No founders aren't carrying their weight<p>-No politics<p>-No debating decisions (this was endless in a previous startup)<p>-No differing visions",1208613813

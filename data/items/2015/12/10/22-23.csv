Android&#x27;s ART system compiles applications to native code when they are installed. You can also install actual native code with Android&#x27;s NDK.<p>If you like the idea of asm.js, then you should check out Go on Android. It does the same thing - offers a restricted set of the language that runs very fast.<p>There&#x27;s definitely a subset of apps that work very well in a browser.

The most pervasive currency is currently the greenback. Every additional party or layer between you and the U.S. government increases credit risk and transaction costs everytime you make a transaction outside the pay network your currency is held in.<p>The root problem with traditional currency is all the trust required to make it work. -- Not that justified trust is a bad thing, but trust makes systems brittle, opaque, and costly to operate. Trust failures result in systemic collapses, trust curation creates inequality and monopoly lock-in, and naturally arising trust choke-points can be abused to deny access to due process. Through the use of cryptographic proof and decentralized networks there is a way to minimize and replace these trust costs.<p>(Just something that&#x27;s been floating around in my head lately...

We all have biases, and the way to ensure good results is to document them thoroughly and make sure they&#x27;re reproduced.  After all, some of the people with biases are right.  Another good way to make this better has been suggested many times, perhaps most famously by Feynman: require that everyone publish their results, even if they&#x27;re negative or inconclusive.  That way you can&#x27;t just publish a steady stream of things you agree with, and everyone gets to learn whatever you learned (or ought to have learned) from whatever experiments you did.<p>There&#x27;s also your point in:<p>> He fails to report his funding sources.<p>Which to me is inherently dishonest, especially in a world where you can decide not to publish your results.<p>So I guess I still don&#x27;t think what you&#x27;re suggesting is ok, but my solution is different and more complex than I think you&#x27;re suggesting.

10714119,comment,10711737,10712189,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"I second this. I absolutely <i>love</i> the visuals, this style is pretty much what I dreamed of eventually building for myself if I ever had some spare time. But I&#x27;m also concerned with the fact that it&#x27;s optimized for looks, not for utility, and I want to make a general observation about the current Quantified Self / fitness trends.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed about them is that products are optimized to <i>look pretty</i>, not to <i>be useful</i>. Those two things are related, but it matters which you optimize for. Depending on which one you care about, you make different choices about e.g. visualization tools you use. To pick on AprilZero, since it&#x27;s the topic of this thread, what I see on the site are:<p>- Charts without scales (or with very impoverished ones) - you can&#x27;t read too many interesting things from them, whether about time or value of measured parameters. There&#x27;s data loss.<p>- Gauge charts, which are cousins of a pie chart, i.e. the thing you use when you care about how nice something looks, as opposed to actually making it useful for learning something from the data.<p>- The weight chart that seems to be doing exactly the opposite of what it should; splines look pretty, but what you want to aim for is a rolling average, which acts as a low-pass filter, eliminating noise from measurements and revealing your weight trend. See how the line leads the data points? It should be lagging behind them. For an example of what I mean, see [0].<p>- Just data, lack of any attempt to infer a course of action based on it.<p>Again, the visual are absolutely stunning and I applaud the work. But now that we&#x27;ve figured out how to make data pretty, we need to focus on how to make it useful. For that, we need to start doing the <i>hard</i> work - understanding what choices we do have and how the data can tell us which decisions to make.<p>For instance, I could track my weight and things I eat, and draw pretty lines of macronutrients over time, etc. but what I <i>really</i> want to have is something that&#x27;ll dynamically rebalance my diet to keep them at optimal levels. I want the software to tell me to eat X or Y for breakfast. And if I feel like eating something entirely different, to have it readjust on the fly. I ate too much fat today, so the suggestions for tomorrow will have less fat. An iterated version of this program could plan stuff in advance and generate me a shopping list, etc. You can probably imagine more possible improvements.<p>But note how in the example above, it turned out that I need exactly <i>zero</i> charts. The input I provide is measurements, but the output I care about is <i>right decisions</i>. Sure, I may like (or need, for something else) to look at the measurement data presented in a nice, visual form. Until my imaginary software is good enough, I might actually need to. But you can see how the focus shifts from just having a line chart to having a representation that will be useful to make decisions.<p>TL;DR: charts and dashboards are means to an end, not end in itself.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://imgur.com/YcXK5af"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/YcXK5af</a> - it&#x27;s a screenshot of a graph I made for myself when I went on diet a few years back; the blue line connects the actual samples, the green one is a rolling average with 7-sample window. Note how the green line lags behind the blue and how it filters out noise. Incidentally, this is exactly why the common advice given to people is to weigh yourself once a week, and not daily - because it&#x27;s simpler to tell them that than to teach them about rolling averages and low-pass filters.",1449787187

It&#x27;s a good time for having fun and pursuing adventures, and it&#x27;s great if you can get compound interest going, but your 20s are generally <i>not</i> a good time for earning money, since income will be limited by lack of experience.<p>Personally, I struggled and worried through my 20s trying and failing to follow the &quot;responsible&quot; path. I struggled to get out of debt and to save money, but I just wasn&#x27;t <i>earning</i> enough that it made any difference. By my late 20s, with still effectively nothing in the bank, having heard too many comments like yours, I thought I was a failure doomed to lifelong poverty.<p>And then I started making real money, my debts vanished, and my savings account just seemed to plump up rapidly of its own accord, whether I paid any attention to my finances or not. Life got a whole lot easier. But it had nothing to do with &quot;responsibility&quot; - it had to do with being lucky enough to have gone into a booming industry, and with the higher salaries I was able to pull after having worked in that industry for years.<p>And then I got divorced and lost it all again. Oops! Back to square one, piles of debt, net worth zero. Except... a couple years went by and real estate prices shot up, so - through no action of my own - my net worth is now several times larger than it was before the divorce. Yay!  But we&#x27;ll see what happens in a few years; I&#x27;m not counting these chickens just yet.<p>My life experience therefore inclines me to agree with the author&#x27;s advice. Financial responsibility has counted for little. I would have done better to enjoy my 20s more, take advantage of my opportunities for adventure and exploration, and to worry a whole lot less about paying off debts which seemed imposing at the time but which would now be small enough to clear up with ease.<p>Am I on track to eat cat food in retirement age? Well, I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s years away. Maybe I&#x27;ll continue to have a steady career and good luck in my choice of real estate, or maybe the market will crash and I&#x27;ll lose everything once again. Maybe I&#x27;ll continue to find interesting work and make good money at it, or maybe the fabled Silicon Valley ageism (of which I have yet to see or experience any trace) will finally strike and my income will disappear. I don&#x27;t know, and I can&#x27;t know. What I do know is that I&#x27;m alive now, I have opportunities to do fun and interesting things now, and it would be foolish to sacrifice all of those opportunities on the altar of some imagined future security which can never be guaranteed.<p>In any case, so what if I spend my last handful of years in poverty? Those are going to be the most limited years of my life anyway, as my body wears out.

You don&#x27;t have to wait for your patch to be accepted in the main project or fork the project to build a custom release.<p>* There&#x27;s no virtualization of IO like in containers.

Interpolation, at least in my mind, means that the fit does have to be perfect.<p>So when I say kernel interpolation I think it is fine to think of it as regression that perfectly passes through any data points.<p>Technically, I like to think of the fact that the data has noise as independent of the strategy that you use to fit it.

NYT will post a link to a popular Youtube video, two days later the video gets pulled, and one week into the article, the links are already stale.<p>As Wiki gets more &#x27;reputable&#x27;, newspapers will posts links to it. Wiki being what it is, the reference to the page will go stale.<p>So here&#x27;s an idea for a service: hash all the outgoing/inside pages on a website. If they change, either 1) give options for users to review, 2) update the link 3) delete the reference. If the original website 404&#x27;s, change the link to the archive page. If a video link is outdated, provide tools to search for similar videos to link, from inside the dashboard. For Wikipedia, automatically link to a certain version of history of a page, not the general page. This is different from the idea posted below because it integrates with existing publishing systems, so it&#x27;d be more b2b, and one would start cashflow right away.<p>For links to social media, use a &#x27;photo snippet&#x27; tool that looks to check if the link is valid, and goes to the image version of the link if validity is dead.<p>I&#x27;m certain people would pay GOOD MONEY for this service.

Studies from last year show a very skewed weighted average from the last 3 months that generate the a1c.

Every minute above this kills stuff. The ideal healthy human&#x27;s response is between 85-100mg/dL. A resting rate away from this shows dysfunction.<p>However, an OGTT shows if you have problems. You take a reading prior to drinking 75g glucose. One big drink. Then you test every 30 minutes until you&#x27;re back to normal, which is usually 2-2.5 hours.

Foreign C libraries are linked dynamically by default, if that&#x27;s being counted.<p>- Comes with (very cheap) green threads and threading primitives, along with useful concurrency structures (like channels). The standard library includes STM for safer shared mutable memory, and many libraries (like async) are available that extend this.

I&#x27;ve really come to enjoy discussions on Hacker News more than anywhere else.<p>> I am speaking of observation, not revelation.<p>Me too. There were lot of observations about people and events in first-century Palestine that were then recorded and preserved over time.<p>I was just in a meeting today. Let&#x27;s say I write a blog post about it and that post is read 2000 years later. While it can&#x27;t be the sole basis for answering the question of whether or not that meeting happened, I think it should be given a lot of respect and precedence when considering the question.<p>But don&#x27;t discount revelation outright! If I want someone to understand me better, I&#x27;d rather tell them myself rather than having them resort to observations and experiments, and I&#x27;d probably give them more information in an hour of talking than they ever could figure out on their own.<p>> &quot;it&#x27;s faith&quot; is the fallback when they don&#x27;t have any other reason<p>If you can explain it completely, it&#x27;s not faith. So that makes sense.<p>The concept of a triune God is one that kinda ends up this way. I can pontificate all I want about how I&#x27;m a father, a son, and a brother all while being a single entity, but at the end of the day it&#x27;s like explaining depth to Flatlanders - it&#x27;s tough to truly understand something that doesn&#x27;t exist on your level. So, what goes beyond my comprehension requires faith. Can it be used as a cop-out or an intellectually lazy answer? Sure! The Bible even suggests that faith is hard - a man once said to Jesus &quot;I believe; help my unbelief!&quot; But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a valid state of mind.<p>I like the chair metaphor for this sort of talk. Sitting in a chair requires a measure of faith that it&#x27;ll hold my weight. If I&#x27;m sitting in the chair, the question is already answered so no more faith is required (unless I wanted to question the idea that the chair would continue to hold my weight!). If I couldn&#x27;t sit in the chair because it&#x27;s behind a glass wall in a museum, then I can choose to believe it will/won&#x27;t hold me or I can choose to not make a decision because, who cares? And for a chair that&#x27;s okay, because it&#x27;s not being prescriptive or dealing with anything existential.<p>But ultimately, the chair can either hold you or it can&#x27;t. One of those outcomes is true. Just because you can&#x27;t sit on the chair doesn&#x27;t mean that there isn&#x27;t an absolute answer. I think you understand that after parsing your response a bit more, just wanted to call the point out specifically.<p>> However, it is important to note that science does not proclaim that if you can&#x27;t observe something, it therefore isn&#x27;t.<p>Yes! I understand this. But I do think that because science is so great at explaining so many things, people will tend to mentally fall into assumptions like &#x27;science is the only way to prove something&#x27; or &#x27;if science cannot prove something, I won&#x27;t believe it&#x27;. This could be strawmanning though.<p>If I understand you correctly you&#x27;re saying that, from a purely scientific standpoint, a belief in the Abrahamic God is no different than believing that we&#x27;re a little simulation run by the Q Continuum. And that&#x27;s a fair point. But I would contend again that science is not the only way to prove something. Historical record, internal logic and narrative, testimony of others, personal experience, revelation...these can be less easy to parse and trust than a clear-cut scientific method, but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate them as methods of persuasion.<p>And perhaps that is our greatest difference. You (if I am understanding correctly; feel free to correct me) believe that belief should be withheld on things that cannot be quantified with scientific methodology. I do not ascribe to this, and this divergence puts us in pretty different places.<p>>>> what is moral is a scientific question\n>> I can see how you could start with that assumption and find ways to justify it, but I don&#x27;t see how you can conclusively prove the initial premise.\n> I think the more interesting question is: Do you disagree and if so, why?<p>If I understand the intent of this exchange, then I think I do disagree. Take something like eugenics; if we observed two societies doing it and one refraining, we might find benefits in both society. An individualistic society might be glad they refrained because they see the intrinsic value of each human life, regardless of their shortcomings, while a collectivistic, Spartan-like society might be glad they kept their stock strong and didn&#x27;t have to do stuff like buy glasses or spend money on sick/disabled people. Point being, observation and the conclusions that are drawn from it could end up being inconclusive or relativistic depending on the underlying values of the society.<p>One of the things I believe about God is that he knows everything about us, and as such would be the most qualified to prescribe the best courses of action for my life and for society. Or, since we&#x27;re on HN, the guy who programmed the app knows the codebase better than anyone, and if he wants others to understand it he writes documentation for others to follow, or maybe goes to a conference to talk about it. And who knows, maybe God has reasoning that would fit within the realm of scientific methodology. I don&#x27;t know, but...&quot;it&#x27;s faith!&quot;",1449785871

I would never criticize Ms. Holmes for using her connections like this, but when stated as above, this investment sounds like a total freebie. And we all know that, thanks to investor herd mentality, one investment is a springboard to less skeptical follow-on investment. In this case, the first investors don&#x27;t sound skeptical at all, because they viewed this as a family-friend favor more than an actual business decision. If Theranos were perceived a hell of an opportunity, do you think he’d give a rat’s ass if her parents would rather she finish her degree?

A police officers job often isn&#x27;t to save the subject, it&#x27;s to save third parties and apprehend the subject. It&#x27;s also to have power over us, a measure of control which firefighter/paramedics don&#x27;t. We surrender power to them so to speak.<p>On the other hand, firefighters and paramedics are more often concerned with directly helping the subject and don&#x27;t have this power over us.<p>There are complex situations with various crossovers (particularly in firefighting where extinguishing a fire might save third parties for instance) but in general the above holds.<p>I think this is an important distinction because we expect the preservation of life. A firefighter can let a building burn (die) and save some third parties and they aren&#x27;t (necessarily) penalised for it. A firefighter/paramedic is also only concerned with the preservation of life, that&#x27;s their sole motive. Police officers motive are necessarily more complex, so if a firefighter can&#x27;t get through a fire to save a subject we forgive them because their intentions could only have been noble - all they would be trying to do is save life.<p>A police officer on the other hand must be seen to save the subject and third parties lives. We seem to demand of police officers that if the subject is trying to kill third parties for example, the officer should step in and take the &#x27;hit&#x27; and get killed. He/She must be restrained enough to not kill the subject and brave enough to sacrafice themselves for the good of the third parties.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is demanded of firefighters and paramedics.<p>I think this extra demand is placed on police officers because of their position of superior power. If they are to be afforded superiority over us citizens, over our liberty and with the power to ruin our lives - we demand of them that they have a noble streak and are prepared to sacrafice themselves for us if the shit hits the fan.",1449785072

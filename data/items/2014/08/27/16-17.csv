That said, based on her account, it seems one of these things is true:<p>1. Code Club&#x27;s board acted independently of any action by Google in an attempt to stop some perceived conflict before it started (e.g. Google balking at further support because on of their key people says some negative things about Google now and then).<p>2. Code Club&#x27;s board acted based on off-the-record or unofficial complaints by unknown Google representatives about the negative things Linda says/said.<p>3. Code Club&#x27;s board acted based on on-the-record/official complaints by Google.<p>If the former, the board is in error. They have neither the obligation nor the right to demand anybody in the organization, Linda or whomever, to behave in any manner when not &quot;on the clock.&quot; Our society is conditioned to accept the imbalance of power that makes such a demand seem reasonable, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way (my opinion, if it&#x27;s not clear, is it ought not be that way).<p>If it&#x27;s either of the latter, it&#x27;s an egregious abuse of power on Google&#x27;s part (and an obsequious act on the Board&#x27;s part). Google&#x27;s relative power and influence makes Code Club a rounding error in terms of their PR efforts, either direction. In this scenario, Google&#x27;s support of Code Club is little more than an advertising purchase masquerading as giving back to the community, which is certainly not unusual, I suppose, but it&#x27;s also not something that leads to anything like an equal/level playing field.<p>If she&#x27;s making stuff up, well, that&#x27;s pretty bad on her part, and at least as awful as any of the above items.",1409158750

I&#x27;ve gotten many good people from former candidates who enjoyed our process and spoke highly of our team.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t have just stopped replying to emails though. An interviewer should always reply, even to politely decline.

That work manifests itself in the creation and upkeep of the code.  We&#x27;ve found that addressing comments as part of our code review process made a big difference in keeping things up to date.<p>Regarding the issue of expressiveness: I never find myself commenting about what is obvious in the code itself.  Often I&#x27;m writing about some thinking behind why something was done a certain way OR identifying expectations of downstream systems that can&#x27;t be expressed using code.  Code enough in environments where you&#x27;re interacting with multiple disparate systems and you&#x27;ll find that some well placed comment providing the broader context for the code is extremely helpful to folks encountering the code the 1st time or to yourself a year later when you&#x27;re incorporating a new feature and have forgotten about all the concerns wrapped up in the code.<p>With the todo issue- we require folks to include a JIRA issue number along with the todo.

As it is, there&#x27;s fixed costs (crew, the plane, fuel to a certain extent) to flying an airplane somewhere regardless of how many people are on it, and the only way to make money is to charge enough to recover those fixed costs. You can either charge more per passenger or you can fit in more passengers. The cost for an additional few inches of legroom on United is about $40 on a larger plane, about $20 on a commuter plane.

8233158,comment,8232746,8232746,3,0,bcantrill,,,"I think a more apt title is &quot;technical interviews suck&quot;, and speaking personally, I have entirely given up on them.  (I would say that I gave up on them after two decades, but the truth is that I gave up on them a decade ago -- and I really tried hard in that first decade to develop the perfect technical interview.)<p>My belief has become that the only way to hire the traits that I&#x27;m looking for (high technical ability, sufficient education, predisposition to rigor, and -- most importantly -- indefatigable persistence) is by judging a candidate on their work, not their performance in an interview. (After all, software engineering isn&#x27;t done via pop quiz -- and it&#x27;s not even a timed test.)<p>The problem then becomes:  how do you judge the works of someone you&#x27;ve never worked with before?  Three ways that have worked for me:<p>(1) Rolodex.  This is an easy way to hire reliably:  someone on the team has worked with the person in the past, and vouches for them as one of the tribe.  Assuming that you trust the person vouching for them, the interview consists of you selling them, not them selling you.  This method has high fidelity (though is still fallible), but also suffers from obvious limitations in terms of scale and breadth.<p>(2) Known curricula.  There are some schools where I know (or someone on the team knows) the computer science curriculum very well, and can assess a student simply by the courses that they have taken (or, better, TA&#x27;d), the labs they have worked in, or the professors that they have worked for.  The fidelity of this method will depend on the school, how well one knows the curriculum, etc. -- and it has all of the strengths and weaknesses of hiring university grads.  (It also suffers from serious scale problems and runs the risk of creating monoculture.)<p>(3) Open source.  If you lead open source projects that attract community contributors, you may find it surprisingly easy to coax the best of those contributors into working for you full-time.  While I know that this isn&#x27;t a fit for every company, it has become my preferred way to hire:  you are hiring someone who can obviously do the work (because, um, they&#x27;re already doing it) and who has demonstrated interested in the problem space (especially if their contributions have come during their free time).  Importantly, you are also not limiting yourself to a particular geographic area or school or company history or whatever; the people I have hired via open source are people I never would have found otherwise.  And, it must be said, they have proven (without exception, actually) to be great hires.  There are obvious problems with this as well in terms of scale and (especially) predictability, but I view open source as the farm system for software engineering:  it&#x27;s a way to find and develop talent at lowest opportunity cost.<p>Edit: I forgot a fourth method that has actually worked for me.<p>(4) Homework.  When interviewing someone who I don&#x27;t know and who is otherwise a stranger, I will ask them some exceedingly basic questions to assess technical viability, and then proceed to discuss the problems that we&#x27;re solving and why I personally find them exciting.  If they are sufficiently interested at the end of this conversation (which is really more me selling them than them selling me), I will assign homework -- which is generally to take some fixed amount of time (I have usually said no more than eight total hours) to build something fun in one of the technologies that we have built or otherwise use.  (When node.js was new, this was to build something in node.js -- but more recently, it&#x27;s been to build something fun with Manta.[1])  If a candidate comes back with completed homework, you each know something about the other:  they were sufficiently interested in you to actually play around (and they like playing around to begin with -- which is essential for us) and you now have some works by which to judge them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.joyent.com/blog/introducing-kartlytics-mario-kart-64-analytics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joyent.com/blog/introducing-kartlytics-mario-kart...</a>",1409158497

Out of the box consumer NAT configurations (WRT-54G, etc) typically run a DNS cache also. Source port randomization in response to Kaminsky&#x27;s paper in 2008 is definitely the sort of thing that would fill NAT tables faster. But RFC4787 was published in 2007.<p>The behavior chosen by the implementers of the Linux netfilter code (see simmons&#x27; post) elegantly covers most cases without getting as specific as REQ-5 in the RFC, and not nearly as specific as you&#x27;re describing. Network operators just manually configure a faster timeout for port 53.

I get what you mean about the idioms of some language: code is easier to maintain when it looks like what others on the team are accustomed to.  But if that&#x27;s the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve, isn&#x27;t that what initial code reviews of new team members can help resolve, among other things?  And isn&#x27;t that a benefit to hiring people who know other languages well?  that they bring in new perspectives and ideas, such that the whole team can grow, over time learning and incorporating those new patterns?<p>Personally, I look for people who can think, who have exposure to a variety of patterns and can synthesize those patterns into their work, making appropriate choices.  More power to us if, for our Perl shop, we hire someone with a strong background in modern Fortran because that different perspective is part of what makes the team diverse, creative, and successful.<p>I don&#x27;t look for an expert in Perl to be even a senior developer here.

Excepting a few cities, when you look at the data and adjust for inflation, owning a house is not a particularly good investment ( <a href=""http://files.foreclosureradar.com/images/foreclosuretruth/History-of-home-values.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.foreclosureradar.com/images/foreclosuretruth/Hi...</a> ).  Add in that the average home loan lasts about 6ish years before folks sell/refi, the fact that interest/fees are front-loaded into the first 5 years of the loan, and that avg. annual maintenance on a house (NOT improvements) tend to average about 1% of the value of the home per year, it gets worse.<p>What it CAN be (if you&#x27;re disciplined and lucky) is leverage and liquidity.  Example: I have my house paid off.  I get a mortgage on it, essentially getting a loan at 4% for $700k.  Now I have $700k that I can make work for me-- a worthwhile idea if I can find a way to make more than 4% on that $700k via other investments (which are not remotely risk-free, but can pay off).  Of course, what most people do when they re-fi their house is self-indulgent stuff-- buying a vacation home, a boat, home improvements that don&#x27;t pay for themselves, etc.",1409157664

But when I tried to scroll to see more, I was moved to the next page.<p>Seems like this would be ideal for a mobile experience, the museum could have the URL within the exhibits (or a QR code, etc) and you could swipe through the information while in the actual Museum. But I guess currently it&#x27;s just a nice desktop browser tech demo.<p>As for the desktop experience, I like the idea of arrow buttons on the side of the screen to cycle through the pages. Because it just feels so strange to scroll the mousewheel and not have the page respond with 1-to-1 movements matching the wheel (and also the latency is a killer). But the arrows just jumps through pages, and not changing content in the page, so you&#x27;ll miss out on things if you click instead of scroll. Pressing the up arrow to go back to a previous page will not take you to the &quot;start&quot; of that page, but instead the last &quot;scroll&quot; of content.<p>When using the scroll wheel instead of the arrows, it doesn&#x27;t actually do anything about half the time.

8232992,comment,8232746,8232746,28,0,tptacek,,,"This is a really excellent post. It talks about a bunch of things that are hobby-horses of mine (I help run recruiting for a large software security firm), and I find myself agreeing with more of it than I disagree with.<p>I would go a little further than Laurie does. I think several of the goals he sets up for his process are not in reality achievable in an interview process.<p>Starting axiom: job interviews are among the most hostile experiences professionals endure in our industry. I think back to my own interviews, and compare them to public speaking, professional disasters, death march projects with insane deadlines, intractable politics, and it&#x27;s pretty much the interviews alone that increase my heart rate. For the past two years, I&#x27;ve tried to make an effort to peek in on the interviews we do here at Matasano, and what I&#x27;ve seen corroborates the belief. Several of our best hires were <i>physically shaking</i> during their interviews. And we try to be nice! In no other common situation does a tech worker find themselves interrogated by a panel of strangers whose implicit goal is to knock them out of contention.<p>Given that interviews are a psychologically challenging experience, and thinking about things like the concept of &quot;depletion&quot; of ego or willpower, it&#x27;s straightforward to see some severe limitations to what can be accomplished in an interview setting. If you&#x27;re spending lots of energy trying to keep from jumping out of your skin in an unpleasant situation, it&#x27;s much harder to solve problems that themselves require lots of energy.<p>Past that, a hypothesis, which is unpleasant for some tech workers to hear (cold comfort: I&#x27;m 100% certain it applies to me as well). Software developers are not, as a cohort, particularly effective intuitive psychologists. Virtually none of us have any training in the subject. We tend sharply towards introversion. We train our brains day-in and day-out by repeating tasks that do nothing to developer our ability to read in-person social cues. For that matter, we tend as a group to eschew forms of communication in which tone of voice, body language, and emotional cues are even transmitted!<p>But several of the objectives Laurie sets out demand exactly that kind of analysis. &quot;Can the candidate intelligently discuss technology?&quot; Well, that&#x27;s subjective, and worse, vague and abstract. Laurie tries to nail &quot;intelligently&quot; down, but I think we can all see that there are other ways in which someone can be &quot;intelligent&quot; about technology that evade those criteria. Since we all intuitively know that, we substitute our own cognitive biases for &quot;intelligently&quot;. All of the sudden, we&#x27;re gauging &quot;confidence&quot; and &quot;comfort level&quot;... we&#x27;ve decided to be psychologists instead of engineers.<p>So, two changes I would urgently suggest Laurie consider for his process:<p>* Audit the whole process for tasks that could generate false positives from a nervous candidate. You aren&#x27;t interviewing people to determine how good they are at interviewing, because interviewing doesn&#x27;t generate money for your company. Try to build a process that is immune to discomfort and lack of confidence. It can be done! Another thing that we&#x27;ve found very effective: &quot;prime&quot; candidates early and repeatedly with non-adversarial conversations that aim to disarm them. We start our whole (multi-week) process with an hour-long version of this. We also try to innoculate our process by communicating in as much excruciating detail as we can what it will entail.<p>* Eliminate all subjective questions and standardize what you&#x27;re left with. Engineers, in my experience, fucking hate this. But it&#x27;s the right thing to do: ask every candidate, as much as possible, the same set of questions. We have a question structure that minimizes open-ended questions but has some structured &quot;exercise&quot; questions that give the candidate some freedom to move around --- the results of those questions can be put on a scoresheet and, to some extent, compared apples-apples to other candidates.",1409156998

8232982,comment,8229385,8230581,2,0,Mz,,,"Well, my opinion is not entirely uninformed or off the cuff. I was briefly <i>Director of Community Life</i> for The TAG Project. I homeschooled my gifted-learning disabled sons. I attended a gifted conference and was a low-level presenter. I did plenty of reading on the subject for a time and participated in lots of discussions with other informed individuals in the gifted community, including some fairly important professionals in this niche field.<p>First of all, most IQ tests do not go above 140. So anything anywhere near 140 may only be telling you the person is at about the limits of what the test can measure. Even for those tests that do go above 140, it requires a qualified assessor to interpret it properly. The smartest kids often do not measure as being all that smart by standard measures. &quot;Genius&quot; is, basically by definition, someone who thinks <i>differently</i> from others. So measuring the kid who is radically different by standard measures has a track record of missing a lot.<p>In recent years, there is increasingly research into and available literature on the idea that gifted kids have different minds. They are not merely &quot;more&quot; of something, they are fundamentally <i>different</i>. The correlation of &quot;speed = intelligence&quot; is a rubric which assumes gifted kids are simply &quot;more&quot; of something. Yes, they do tend to be faster than average, even if they are slow compared to other gifted students, but it&#x27;s really a lot more complicated than that and I think the emphasis on speed does a huge disservice to the gifted community.<p>The &quot;fast = smart&quot; paradigm is a really major metaphor for giftedness in the world. For example, Stephanie Tolan&#x27;s essay &quot;Is it a cheetah?&quot; is very popular: <a href=""http://www.stephanietolan.com/is_it_a_cheetah.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stephanietolan.com/is_it_a_cheetah.htm</a>  \nI once wrote something of a polite rebuttal to that which used redwoods and gazelles as other metaphors. I am not terribly important in the world and it did not become popular (and is no longer online, unless it got captured on The Way Back Machine). I think the cheetah metaphor does a disservice to the gifted community in part because of the unstated assumption that smart people are all dangerous predators. Gazelles are just as fast and are not predators. Why not use that as a metaphor?<p>Anyway, I am quite busy today so I don&#x27;t plan to argue this or dig up detailed supporting links. If you really want to look into it, HN&#x27;s member who goes by the handle tokenadult is a good resource on the topics of intelligence and education. I believe his profile contains links to resources and his posting history, both comments and articles, is likely to be enlightening. (Though I have no idea if he would agree with any of my views above. He and I are not close. We haven&#x27;t talked in quite a long time. But I have reason to believe he remains far more current on these subjects than I am.)",1409156931

They were two very different experiences.<p>One decided to have me do multiple interviews, with whiteboard coding. The first interviewer was my favorite, because we got to talk about the design of my internship project, how it could be extended, pitfalls to consider, etc. That actually let me stretch my legs a bit and show that I can make intelligent software decisions. The rest of the interviews were basically worthless; the classic small algorithm problem that I could easily figure out with a bit more time or by working with another more experienced engineer. The code I wrote on the board showed that I could write for loops and use a standard library; it was very difficult to modify or refactor if we saw an issue with what I wrote. Why not at least a laptop, basic text editor, and a projector?<p>The other company gave me a few hours to write up a solution, in an IDE, to a somewhat beefy problem. We had a couple of discussions about my approach, potential pitfalls, cases that I couldn&#x27;t handle, optimality, etc. I liked this, since it was much closer to being representative of real software work; collaboration, discussion, and I also got to show how I would actually create a solution.<p>That&#x27;s a stark contrast.

No I didn&#x27;t get that job; I screwed up the last part (well I did answer some questions incorrectly but I think they didn&#x27;t care much about that). For what it is worth, the position has to do with security research and engineering. The coding part I had to go through was fairly quickly (but the interviewer, IMO, didn&#x27;t do a good job at it and caused me a lot of trouble). Geesh, I wish I was given a offer, but looking back I wasn&#x27;t ready to deliver ANYTHING valuable as an [researcher]engineer yet.<p>When people just say a bunch of smart words like async and parallelism, ask them to define them with concrete examples. Ask them further to break down their &quot;textbook knowledge.&quot; That&#x27;s by far, IMHO, the best way to evaluate whether a junior prospective engineer knew a lot than average or not. You want a hard question? Just ask people to go as deep as they can to explain to you what happen after a URL is entered into a HTTP client such as browser or curl.<p>I am terrible at coding under pressure. Actually, I am terrible at coding. I constantly read books and github projects and I end up asking a lot of questions: is this a good practice to do such. You see, I am all for style and I want to be better writing code close to what people prefer to write. I went to talks and learned tips how to write better code and I will immediately employe those new techniques in my new projects.<p>I will end up with questions and I always wish someone could be around and help. I usually go to IRC or stackoverflow for opinion but I hope when I do get a job soon, I will be able to ask my senior colleague and hope they could provide feedback.<p>I haven&#x27;t done everything like some superstar already have at my age. I suck and I am sorry, but I think I am one smart ass person capable of delivering a project with some guidance and day-to-day meeting and mentorship.<p>In fact there are senior engineers I&#x27;ve met or worked very very briefly during hackathon and when I asked them certain design question they will blur about their ideas and don&#x27;t really know how to contribute, or up to me to explore what could be done. In essence, neither of us know everything. Senior knows more because they have done more, almost certainly something repetitive. It is like asking me to write hello world every day and I will have no problem responding to it. Sometimes when you look at code written by senior engineers their code smell even worse than what I write (but there are definitely the good one I can always use as reference).<p>Conclusion is: when you want to hire a new engineer, especially a junior engineer, ask yourself: are you ready to be a mentor and is there anyone ready to believe they can be a good mentor.

8232963,comment,8232746,8232746,25,0,tokenadult,,,"I read the comments already posted in this thread before I read the fine blog post. Almost everybody sucks at interviewing. Research shows that even though job applicants think that an interview is one of the more fair procedures for hiring a new worker for almost any kind of a job, it is one of the least effective.<p>There are many discussions here on HN about company hiring procedures. Company hiring procedures and their effectiveness is a heavily researched topic in industrial and organizational psychology, but most hiring managers and most job applicants haven&#x27;t looked up much of the research. After reading the blog post kindly submitted here, I&#x27;ll make some comments on its tl;dr summary at the end of the post.<p>1. many interview techniques test skills that are at best irrelevant to real working life<p>Yep, that&#x27;s why you want your company hiring procedures to be based on research and what really matters for finding good workers.<p>2. you want somebody who knows enough to do the job right now<p>That&#x27;s the ideal. That&#x27;s why work-sample tests are, by replicated research, a very good hiring procedure, one of the best possible hiring procedures.<p>3. or somebody smart and motivated enough that they can learn the job quickly<p>Yep, and that&#x27;s why tests of &quot;general mental ability&quot; are also a very effective hiring procedure, although there are some legal requirements surrounding use of those that you have to be careful about in the United States.<p>4. you want somebody who keeps getting better at what they do<p>For sure, as that is the only way your company can meet new challenges as they come up in the company&#x27;s business.<p>5. your interview should be a collaborative conversations, not a combative interrogation<p>I&#x27;m not sure that the author here has provided evidence for the &quot;should&quot; statement in this summary, although I actually don&#x27;t disagree as a matter of how I do job interviews.<p>6. you also want somebody who you will enjoy working with<p>Basically, almost all hiring managers fall victim to overemphasizing likability and underemphasizing ability to get the job done, but, yeah, you don&#x27;t want to hire someone who makes the workplace miserable--that might cost you losing other good workers.<p>7. it&#x27;s important to separate &quot;enjoy working with&quot; from &quot;enjoy hanging out with&quot;<p>Absolutely. The best worker in your company may not be the same person you go out with socially after work.<p>8. don&#x27;t hire assholes, no matter how good they are<p>The trick here is to figure out how much annoying behavior qualifies a person as an &quot;asshole&quot; in a particular context, and that is not easy.<p>9. if your team isn&#x27;t diverse, your team is worse than it needed to be<p>There is an increasing body of research to back up this idea.<p>10. accept that hiring takes a really long time and is really, really hard<p>Hiring is hard. It may or may not be time-consuming, depending on how efficiently you do it.<p>The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, &quot;The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,&quot;[1] Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274 sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the <i>huge</i> peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, personality tests, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.[2]<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: If you are hiring for any kind of job in the United States, with its legal rules about hiring, prefer a work-sample test as your hiring procedure. If you are hiring in most other parts of the world, use a work-sample test in combination with a general mental ability test.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well. One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. (But the calculated validity of each of the two best kinds of procedures, standing alone, is only 0.54 for work sample tests and 0.51 for general mental ability tests.) Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it&#x27;s a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>Because of a Supreme Court decision in the United States (the decision does not apply in other countries, which have different statutes about employment), it is legally risky to give job applicants general mental ability tests such as a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents&#x27; generation) as a routine part of hiring procedures. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case[3] interpreted a federal statute about employment discrimination and held that a general intelligence test used in hiring that could have a &quot;disparate impact&quot; on applicants of some protected classes must &quot;bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used.&quot; In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring procedure had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring procedure could be challenged as illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants. A company defending a brain-teaser test for hiring would have to defend it by showing it is supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Such validation studies can be quite expensive. (Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. One other big difference between the United States and other countries is the relative ease with which workers may be fired in the United States, allowing companies to correct hiring mistakes by terminating the employment of the workers they hired mistakenly. The more legal protections a worker has from being fired, the more reluctant companies will be about hiring in the first place.)<p>The social background to the legal environment in the United States is explained in various books about hiring procedures,[4] and some of the social background appears to be changing in the most recent few decades, with the prospect for further changes.[5]<p>Previous discussion on HN pointed out that the Schmidt & Hunter (1998) article showed that multi-factor procedures work better than single-factor procedures, a summary of that article we can find in the current professional literature, for example &quot;Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures&quot;[6] (2010) by Cornelius J. König, Ute-Christine Klehe, Matthias Berchtold, and Martin Kleinmann:<p>&quot;Choosing personnel selection procedures could be so simple: Grab your copy of Schmidt and Hunter (1998) and read their Table 1 (again). This should remind you to use a general mental ability (GMA) test in combination with an integrity test, a structured interview, a work sample test, and/or a conscientiousness measure.&quot;<p>But the 2010 article notes, looking at actual practice of companies around the world, &quot;However, this idea does not seem to capture what is actually happening in organizations, as practitioners worldwide often use procedures with low predictive validity and regularly ignore procedures that are more valid (e.g., Di Milia, 2004; Lievens & De Paepe, 2004; Ryan, McFarland, Baron, & Page, 1999; Scholarios & Lockyer, 1999; Schuler, Hell, Trapmann, Schaar, & Boramir, 2007; Taylor, Keelty, & McDonnell, 2002). For example, the highly valid work sample tests are hardly used in the US, and the potentially rather useless procedure of graphology (Dean, 1992; Neter & Ben-Shakhar, 1989) is applied somewhere between occasionally and often in France (Ryan et al., 1999). In Germany, the use of GMA tests is reported to be low and to be decreasing (i.e., only 30% of the companies surveyed by Schuler et al., 2007, now use them).&quot;<p>[1]<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>[2]<p><a href=""http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes...</a><p>[3]<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>[4]<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC</a><p>[5]<p><a href=""http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full</a><p><a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_Racial_Inequality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_R...</a><p>[6]<p><a href=""http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/preprint_j.1468_2389.2010.00485.x.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/prepri...</a>",1409156735

Disk IO is a major bottleneck. If you&#x27;re using a large genomic dataset, you shouldn&#x27;t be sorting your results in text format anyway... it would take way too much time and temporary disk space. What you&#x27;d probably want is a row filter to extract out the rows of interest. Or, you&#x27;d be calculating some other kind of non-trivial summary statistics. In both of these cases, you&#x27;d need to use some kind of custom program. But you&#x27;d still should be operating on the stream, not the entire dataset.<p>(Of the top of my head I can think of only a few instances where you&#x27;d need to operate on a column as opposed to a row in genome data - multiple testing correction being the main one)<p>If you need to sort by two columns, yes, by all means use &quot;sort&quot;.

Boosting is <i>not</i>, even today, part of the standard statistics curriculum, despite its wide utility.  But the bootstrap is.  I wonder why?<p>Describing Leo Breiman as a stats professor is similarly twisted.  He was always an outlier in traditional statistics; in fact, he left a position in the math department at UCLA because he didn&#x27;t fit in, and began independent consulting, during which time he developed CART.  And during his time, years later, as a bona fide stats professor at UC Berkeley, he spent considerable effort overcoming a tendency of mainstream stats to ignore the implications of computing.  For instance, he was one of a small number of stats professors who was active in the NIPS community.  (His bio at <a href=""http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213290"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213290</a> is absolutely fascinating, see pages 195-6 for his feelings about conventional statistics.)<p>And don&#x27;t forget that a lot of the popularity of CART was due to the C4.5 implementation, due to Ross Quinlan, a CS professor with a physics background, which allowed easy building of classifiers on top of trees.  Which points out another thing, that these advances have in many cases not come from, strictly speaking, <i>computer science</i>; physicists and engineers have been very influential.<p>SVM&#x27;s were developed by Vladimir Vapnik and collaborators, who came out of a Russian math/physics background.  Who cares whether SVMs have a model or not?  This is an example of the myopia that afflicts old-fashioned statistics.  SVMs are highly effective predictors with deep mathematical properties and admit a statistical analysis of their performance and properties.  (You don&#x27;t think every statistician who uses logistic regression really believes this is a <i>model</i> for the data generation process!  Yet logistic regression is part of the stats canon.)  The SVM analysis (&quot;large margin classifiers&quot;) largely took place, again, outside mainstream statistics.<p>We could say the same thing about neural networks.<p>And we could say the same thing about deep learning.<p>NNs: 1980s-1990s.  SVMs: 1990s-2000s.  Deep learning: 2000s-2010s.  In ten years, we&#x27;ll be adding another example to the list, because this myopia is not just poor marketing skills.",1409155768

The central idea of this field of inquiry is using the type system to limit the proliferation and capabilities of aliases. Concurrency is one application: a class of race conditions can be prevented if you can statically guarantee that only one read/write reference to an object exists, potentially in the face of many read-only references. But there are also applications to memory management: you can use annotations to ensure that, e.g. that no aliases to objects in a region outlive the region. No existing system is really satisfactory in terms of annotation overhead versus the ability to accommodate arbitrary object graphs.<p>IMHO, figuring out a usable system should at least pass the obviousness hurdle to patentability. I think the real issue is that it neither costs much money to develop these ideas, nor does anyone make any money off compiler technology, so the rationale for patents isn&#x27;t really implicated. If the idea was backed by real world testing of its usability in production systems, I think that could merit a patent, because that is expensive R&D someone could free-ride off of.",1409155356

8232816,comment,8226918,8226918,1,0,todd8,,,"Once upon a time, I was an engineer with only the most superficial understanding of taxes and the economy.  Today, I&#x27;m still only an engineer (at heart), but in the many many years of working and investing I&#x27;ve learned a few things.  (I have only had one formal course in economics.  At least it was taught by Robert Solow.)  Those that already understand the corporate tax even a little should probably skip this post (and to those that really understand it feel free to correct me where I don&#x27;t understand it well enough).  Taxes and their effects are considerably more complex in real life than my examples below.<p>When a partnership makes money, the profits flow through to the partners and are taxed as ordinary income, so to compare:<p><pre><code>    XYZ Parners (having 10 equal parners) makes $10,000,000\n    Tom (a parner) has:\n      Additional ordinary income: $1,000,000 \n      Taxes:\n        Federal (%39.6)            -$396,000\n\tState (CA %12.3)           -$123,000\n    ----------------------------------------\n      Net:                          $481,000\n\n\n    ABC Corp (with say 10 owners) makes $10,000,000 in profit\n     Corporate profits         $10,000,000\n     Taxes:\n       Federal (%35)           -$3,500,000\n       State (CA %8.84)        -$  884,000\n    ----------------------------------------\n      Net:                      $ 5,616,000\n    </code></pre>\nNote that this $5,616,000 can be retained by the corporation, but nobody actually benefits from it until it is distributed to the owners, distributed to it ten owners as dividends:<p><pre><code>    Tina (an owner) receives $561,600 dividend payment\n      Additional investment income of   $561,600\n      Taxes:\n        Federal (%23.8)                 -$133,661\n\tState (CA %8.84)                -$ 49,645\n    ----------------------------------------------------\n      Net:                               $378,294\n</code></pre>\nThere are a few things to notice here, before an owner gets any money out of a C corp, there are four taxes leveied and over %60 of the company&#x27;s profits are taxed away.  This puts corporations at a disadvantage, tax-wise, to parnerships under my very simplified example.  They are also at a disadvantage to foriegn corporations that don&#x27;t have high corporate tax rates.<p>There are direct ways for the corporation to control its profits.  It can increase wages to employees.  In this case say there are 100 employees, each compensated the same and all profits are paid out to employees:<p><pre><code>    Tim (an employee) receives a bonus of $100,000 (1/100 * 10 Million)\n      Additional ordinary income         $100,000\n      Taxes:\n       Federal (%35)                     -$35,000\n       State (CA %8.84)                  -$ 8,840\n    ---------------------------------------------\n      Net:                                $56,160\n</code></pre>\nThese taxes are paid by each of the 100 employees receiving bonuses.<p>Another way that a corporation can lower its profits is by lowering the price of good sold, which benefits consumers.<p>Owners of the corporation like Tina above want to make something from the ownership of the company and through the board of directors (voted in by Tina and the others) they expect the company to eventually issue dividends (even if it is too far in the future to benifit Tina the building retained earnings will drive up the value of Tina&#x27;s shares because of the <i>anticipation</i> of future dividends).  This keeps corporations aiming for profits; their owners insist on it.  Eventually Tina will have to pay taxes on the capital gains from the increased value of her shares or to pay taxes on dividend issued by the corporation.<p>Note that parnerships don&#x27;t pay corporate taxes, instead the owners pay income taxes on the profits.  Corporate taxes introduce another layer of taxes and complicate the tax system.  Why not have zero corporate tax?  Firms structured as parnerships don&#x27;t pay corporate taxes and the income will still be taxed by the time it gets to Tom or Tina.  No indivdual gets away without paying taxes on money he or she receives no matter what the corporate tax rate is.  This is why other countries can have lower corporate tax rate that the US.<p>Of what benefit are corporate taxes. Like VATs, corporate taxes affect the entire population. The impacts are diffuse and a bit opaque so the voters being affected by it are unaware of it, so it is a less painful way for governments to raise more revenue from us. Corporate taxes raise the cost of capital to corporations, which has a negative impact on the growth of the overall economy. Further, it incentivises companies to actively lobby for special breaks and perks.  Politicians of all stripes like this system because corporations are big donors that keep the croney capitalism going.<p>The real question is who bears the corporate tax and is this the most efficient and fair way to collect taxes [1].  In my own opinion, I don&#x27;t think it is a good idea.  Why not simply raise taxes on dividend income to ordinary rates and eliminate the corporate tax entirely.

Getting timely notification that cert A is invalid or that server B should no longer be using cert A is still good.  It doesn&#x27;t solve <i>every</i> problem (like somebody blocking access to the CA to prevent the OCSP check) but it&#x27;s not worthless.<p>It can be defeated if the user or his ISP is pwned.  It might kick in too late to properly save the user if the connection to the CA is too slow.<p>But it still does nicely handle the case where a server and its cert are no longer trustworthy.",1409155260

This definitely brings the Zune to mind.  Newsflash: you need an edge to compete!<p>Amazon needs to drop Fire OS and just make a damn good Android phone with some well thought through customizations/exclusive apps for a great price.

Even after only one year of not paying for full comprehensive, I will save money if it gets stolen or burns to the ground and I walk away. (I do have high third party - so if I hit a Porsche, damage to it and people is covered). I pay $300/year for the car insurance I have.<p>I currently don&#x27;t have any kids, so I&#x27;ve opted out of Life Insurance at work, instead getting more money into my bank account. In all honestly my savings account would cover my funeral expenses, so why would I want my family to get $250k in the event of my death? It&#x27;s not going to make them happier.<p>I also opted out of the health insurance at work, so I get a bigger paycheck. I&#x27;m 32, fit and strong, and I can count on one hand the number of times I&#x27;ve been to a doctor in my life. Obviously this circumstance will change as I get older and have kids, and I&#x27;ll re-work my approach.<p>EDIT: I live in Canada - basic health care is more than good enough.",1409155220

Seems to me it takes a lot of critical thinking about the world to be able to do that.<p>Or maybe it&#x27;s contemporary conceptual based art you&#x27;re thinking about? A lot of it requires the artist to think critically about human social structures in order to create commentary on it.<p>Sure, anyone can claim they&#x27;re an artist and produce work that is not well thought out or executed, but that&#x27;s not a reason to conclude that artists lack critical thinking skills. Every professional working artist I know here in NYC is exceptionally good with critical thought.<p>Just because you don&#x27;t use a logic based language to reason doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not thinking critically.",1409155200

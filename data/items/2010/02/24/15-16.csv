1148229,comment,1147968,1147968,0,0,Jun8,,,"This <i>is</i> a truly brilliant essay on the scientific method, clearly showing why Asimov was regarded as one of the best writers popularized and explained scientific concepts. His ""Please Explain"" should be required reading.<p>However, I think he has misclassified the error of the English Lit correspondent in this essay. Since I have witnessed this misunderstanding many times (and I want to postpone writing my C++ thread pool code), let me elaborate. There are basically three areas of intellectual endeavor, classified by how they go about investigating the truth of the statements: One is scientific, where questions are handled using the scientific approach, so well described by Asimov. The other is group is axiomatic systems, like mathematics (and heraldry), where statements are mostly <i>proven</i> rather than checked through experiments. Given a statement, e.g. ""there are infinitely many primes"", one does not go about making measurements in the real world to check its truth (although sometimes real-world models can help, pioneered by Archimedes in the ""Sand Reckoner"").<p>Then, there's a third category of questions where these two approaches fail. In fact, when asked a question of this type, one does not immediately know how to go about proceeding to investigate it, e.g. ""What is truth, Is there a God"", etc. This, of course, is the realm of philosophy with somewhat different techniques of tackling problems then the previous two.<p>With this (rather simplistic) classification, we can see the impedance mismatch between Asimov and the Lit guy. Asimov is the scientist par excellence and is talking about the scientific method. However, the Lit guy's letter (truth is relative, etc.) is the culmination of a certain philosophy that is still the accepted standard in liberal arts school and may be summed up as moral relativism. The guy's obvious error is to apply this approach to the scientific realm. But mind you, this is very common with people of this background. If you don't believe me, just find a liberal arts major and talk for 10mins. He/she will be dumbstruck that you think otherwise. A common example with such people is how Newton's theory was ""wrong"" and Einstein's theory ""corrected"" it, clearly showing there's no absolute truth. Years ago, my professor in graduate level Syntax course gave this very example with the same conclusion that the Lit guy arrived.<p>But apart from its misapplication to scientific matters (such as the shape of the earth), is the moral relativistic approach a useful one, despite its acceptance as an axiom in a lot of universities? Now, that is a long debate.",1267026993

A root user on the host node can simply run the command\nvzctl enter 1111\nand enter your vps without a password. To make things even scarier, when an admin enters your container this way. It doesnt leave a bash history file. You have a very small chance of ever knowing they entered the container at all.<p>Even if they dont want to enter your container. They still have full access to all of your files which are located in in the /vz folder on the host node.<p>Other vps solutions are slightly more secure.

The case is certainly not as clear cut as Bild claims but Bild might have a subtler point.<p>After all Apple does censor (if censorship is defined as checking content before publishing and rejecting certain content based on certain criteria) - but that certainly doesn't have to be a problem. After all editors in chief censor, too (using that same definition).<p>We have no problem with that because there are several competing newspapers which create ample pluralism without any need to intervene when editors in chief censor.<p>We (i.e. Germany) don't rely on that when it comes to broadcasting. That's why we have public broadcasting institutions. They were created because it was believed that merely private broadcasting is unable to create ample pluralism. Too few frequencies, too expensive equipment - a technolgy to which only a select few have access. Not enough for a democratic society. Or so it was thought.<p>This is not to claim that any of those views (i.e. private competition among newspapers creates ample pluralism, the same won't work with broadcasting and public broadcasting can solve that problem) are correct, it's just to say that we traditonally have no problem treating media organisations differently than, say, manufacturers of toys.<p>It's a valid argument to have whether Apple should be allowed to freely censor or not.

In archaeology, some guy was just claiming he might have found the <i>first</i> spot that civilization started, and it was from 12000 years ago (if I remember right).  How does he know?  Why make claims for that?  Why not just stick to ""oldest known"", rather than sensationalize it?<p>Why also does every show have to talk about either evolution or global warming?  I watched a great Bobby McFarrin special on music, and all these scientists involved kept talking about evolution, and ""since we know evolution is true then X"" and the hilarious part was that all the scientists came to contradictory conclusions.  :-)  Why not just leave the whole ""evolution is true"" part out, and just follow the data where it leads?",1267025316

This isn’t pizza delivery: just because a lawyer has passed the bar, it doesn’t mean that they can whip up legal documents in 30 minutes or less. How “standard” is the document you’re requesting?</i><p><i>If it’s as standard as you think it is, then order it off LegalZoom.com and be done with it (or take said LZ document, and have your lawyer make modifications to it that fit your business situation).</i><p><i>I put together my first contracts by reading contract law books, BarBri material, and reviewing a variety of other contracts (both client, and vendor), and adapting it all to fit into my needs. That process took me a total of 10-12 days.</i><p><i>Now, using the example of my first contracts I did, take that same number, with 8 hours a day, and count the revenue I’ve lost out on by doing it myself. In the months after that, I met with various clients, who needed different legal clauses, and I spent no less than 1 day for each client, sometimes 2, making said modifications, researching them, and reviewing them.</i><p><i>And while my contracts always passed the client’s gauntlet of internal counsel, I never felt comfortable with it until I took it to a lawyer. You are paying for more than a document. Outsource your risk.</i><p>This is good advice for what the client should do.  However, that is the client's choice.  If they instead opt for the more expensive option of getting a standard document from a bricks-and-mortar law firm, for whatever host of psychological and practical reasons, that is their prerogative.<p>I understood the issue with template derivations to concern common documents.  If the attorney provides a form document that is too generic to suit the specific requirements of an idiosyncratic business situation that truly merits a custom document, _that_ is the essential problem  - call it deception, incompetence, etc.  In any event, the problem there is altogether distinct from the concept of billing higher than literal time spent on template derivations.<p><i>2. Your web design analogy doesn’t apply. Law firms have different rates for partners, associates, and paralegals, and based on who works on your task, you are billed accordingly.</i><p>I did not know that.  If that's in fact the case with a given firm, then billing you attorney's rates for a paralegal's work is wrong.<p>But again, it is wrong because that's not what they claim to do, not because it's wrong to bill out all work by all personnel out at a standard firm rate.<p>It may be unethical, but for a different reason than the one that appears to be given by the original author.<p><i>The partner is still 100% on the hook for any work that these folks churn out, so it better be right the first time. They don’t have unlimited time, and certainly not unlimited billing time. So any contract work that requires them to come back to and defend due to uncertainties/errors, is work they shouldn’t have done at all.</i><p>Agreed, but again, that's the attorney's problem, not because it's wrong to bill out a paralegal's work at $300/hr <i>ipso facto</i>.<p><i>And I’m pretty sure, the associates and paralegals don’t want to be called “peons”.</i><p>I'm pretty sure of that too.  :-)<p><i>There’s an acceptable amount of margin, but even then, it’s not really margin. A copy doesn’t cost 5 cents. A copy costs man-hours to a) interrupt your existing train of thought, b) go to the copier, c) make said copies, d) potentially troubleshoot why the copier doesn’t work and correct it or find and alternative, e) collect copies, f) resume work.</i><p><i>Think about the cost of “context switching” next time you say you can make copies cheaper than the next person.</i><p>Strongly agreed.  All the more reason to mark up the hard costs or charge a separate service fee for the end result of utilising the product.<p><i>Continue to look at it from a consulting/professional services view. Sure your client may call you up with some basic questions, and you can answer them no problem, but once the questions start getting complex, you start to get a little uneasy with giving them something valuable for nothing in return.</i><p>Personally, I give away a great deal of free advice, consultation and general communication to my clients.<p>But I don't fault someone else for being a little more practically minded than I about these things.<p><i>Your bill should not be a guesstimate. Everyone, and I mean, everyone is required to record the number of hours they spent on a task or project. IT consultants do it, and lawyers do it.

Those conditions act as a get out of jail free card for big organisations, and I'm not sure that is healthy. If you set up a service that can host content provided by others, and that service is successful in large part because it enables people to break some law (copyright, privacy, whatever), why <i>should</i> you get a free pass? What you are doing is <i>not</i> then the same as a post office or phone provider, because you are directly profiting and your business model is based in part on illegal activities.<p>An extension of this idea is that several powerful corporations, Google among them, have been pushing back the boundaries of the law concerning privacy, personal data protection, intellectual property rights, defamation and so on, as hard as they can. I am quite sure that <i>that</i> is not a healthy trend. Services like Google Groups and Google News are based on leeching the work of others. Google Maps and Google Street View have serious privacy concerns, to the extent that both have been partially blocked in several nations either by law or just by large numbers of people turning out to physically block the camera car from entering their village. Google Video/YouTube established themselves based substantially on blatant copyright infringement. And then you get things like the Buzz fiasco a few days ago.<p>All of this is done from behind a virtual shield where it is almost impossible for anyone who is damaged by such actions to contact Google about it short of filing a court action. The latter is prohibitively expensive in some jurisdictions, notably including the US, in cases where the damage is not a substantial direct financial cost that a court can award back, which basically means the little guy can't stand up to the mighty corporation even in cases where the corporation's behaviour is clearly unethical and/or illegal.<p>While I would certainly prefer to have robust laws implemented to protect personal privacy and the like, and to see Google forced to comply with those like anyone else, until that happens I half-welcome just about any non-violent effort to check the Powers That Be and make them reconsider whether some of the things they are trying to achieve are a step too far.

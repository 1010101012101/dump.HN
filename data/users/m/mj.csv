mjn,,7699,3.97727,164,1430,"AI-researching academic. I have a somewhat classic &quot;broad&quot; view of AI. Not so much in the sense of strong vs. weak AI, but in the sense of AI as a rich interdisciplinary field rather than a purely technical one, where an important part of the field&#x27;s research is in understanding how to formalize/computationalize vague concepts like &quot;intelligence&quot;. A few AI folks I like in that vein: Marvin Minsky, Robert Abelson, John McCarthy, Allen Newell, Phil Agre, Erik Mueller, Michael Mateas, Ian Horswill, Jaime Carbonell.<p>Some interesting domains: design-support and design-automation systems, generative art, computer music, videogame possibility spaces, procedural architecture. And the history of all that stuff.<p>Biographically speaking, I&#x27;m an American, of recent Greek descent, who lives in Copenhagen. If you&#x27;d like to follow up about anything, email is on my website: http://www.kmjn.org/<p>Some essays: http://www.kmjn.org/notes/",1297784376,1452077124

6827746,comment,6827077,6827273,1,0,jervisfm,,,"> There will be an eventual cap at 21 million bitcoins.<p>At the increasingly slow rate that coins are produced, this won&#x27;t happen for some. But assuming that bitcoins are still around and in use at the point in time in the future when this happens, what will be the effect of this?<p>The supply is fixed and no more can be produced; and since it&#x27;s still around, chances are there is demand / usage that would likely grow. The likely result seems to be that from that point onwards, bitcoin&#x27;s value would only grow to due an increase in its scarcity. Perhaps, this is a possible justification or rationalization for bitcoins as a (very) <i>long term</i> investment.<p>Also, not too familiar with the internal bitcoin protocol but what will happen to the network of miners who help with verifying / maintaining the transaction ledger? I think the reason they participate is that they are (proportionally) rewarded for their services in new bitcoins. When this is no longer the case, who will agree to do this work then?",1385913541

Its actually the exact opposite, the lesser the people the lesser the fluctuations/volatility. And this is not just about the markets, it applies to most things. ex:<p>1.

I call baloney on the silly idea that &quot;gendered pronouns&quot; make life better or worse for anyone in actual society as contrasted with &quot;nongendered pronouns.&quot; What is my evidence? I speak the world&#x27;s most-spoken language (the only language that arguably has more speakers than English, namely Modern Standard Chinese) and it has totally nongendered pronouns. There is not a distinction in spoken Chinese[1] between &quot;he,&quot; &quot;she,&quot; or &quot;it,&quot; as the language has just one third-person singular pronoun, namely <i>tā.</i><p>But my wife, who grew up in Chinese-speaking society and has since lived in English-speaking society, and I, who have lived in both places, think it is ludicrous to suppose that Chinese-speaking society is &quot;less sexist&quot; in any systematic way just because of the pronoun system of Chinese. Pronouns appear to make no difference at all. The map is not the territory. On this issue, languages appear to vary arbitrarily with no particular influence on social custom, and not much influence from social notions of male or female superiority or inferiority. Gendered pronouns don&#x27;t matter for anything important. It is an extraordinary claim to say that they do. People who make extraordinary claims should bring along extraordinary evidence to back up those claims.<p>[1] Under <i>Western</i> influence, after extensive contact with speakers of Indo-European languages and translation of books from those languages into Chinese, the Chinese writing system has sometimes distinguished written forms &#x27;他,&#x27;她,&#x27; and &#x27;它&#x27; for &quot;he,&quot; &quot;she,&quot; and &quot;it,&quot; but all are pronounced /tā/ in speech and this distinction has to be painstakingly learned by Chinese children in school, with many native speakers of Chinese confusing the pronouns of English as to gender for years after learning them. For example, I have heard plenty of Chinese-language conversations in which someone describes a situation involving men and women and then starts speaking about individual persons in the situation as he/she did this or that to him/her, and sometimes a listener breaks into the conversation with &quot;male or female?&quot; to keep track of who is whom. And I&#x27;ve heard plenty of Chinese speakers talk about &quot;my sister . . . he is&quot; or &quot;my brother . . . she is&quot; and so forth, making clear that their brains don&#x27;t distinguish pronouns by grammatical gender in any language.",1385911604

Quite honestly, I don&#x27;t see the point of it.<p>Programming is not a competitive process; it is cooperative. Some of your greatest resources are the people around you. Even after 15 years in the industry, I&#x27;ll still ask questions of my coworkers at least once every couple of days.<p>A puzzle is something designed by another person, with the specific intention of tricking you. That&#x27;s not quite the same thing as a real-world stumper problem, although there can be some similarities. And once again, the times when you&#x27;re stumped are precisely the times when you want to talk to your coworkers about it. Often the very act of explaining the problem to someone else is enough to give you the solution! Sitting there on your own, banging your head on the keyboard is the stupid way to do it.<p>The most important thing when it comes to debugging is to understand how things work at least one level below where you&#x27;re working at (such as understanding how the library calls in the language you use translate to system calls, or being able to dissect HTTP requests/responses, or even TCP/IP frames, or if you&#x27;re programming in C for example, understanding how the compiler works, how it optimizes, where the edge cases are, or even knowing some assembly language so that you can look at a stack dump and figure out what the computer actually did vs what you thought you told it to do). I dislike puzzles for the same reason I dislike trick questions on exams. They&#x27;re not designed to test your knowledge or ability; they&#x27;re designed to see if you can find the needle they&#x27;ve oh-so-cleverly hidden in a haystack. That sort of thing is fine if it&#x27;s for your own amusement (people do, after all, enjoy crossword puzzles), but as hiring criteria I find them misguided at best.<p>Learn new things from time to time, but focus on what you&#x27;re passionate about.

We&#x27;ve run tests which show that students learn more when they&#x27;re advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. As I write this we&#x27;re running dozens of A/B tests to learn what we can do to make people learn more, from testing how review scheduling affects accuracy to simply testing different teaching styles.<p>Whether you&#x27;re a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. You&#x27;ll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business – though we have &quot;celebrity&quot; devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google&#x27;s first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven&#x27;t heard of but who are just as awesome.<p>---<p>I&#x27;m going to put in a special plug for mobile: Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two people (me and one other person) working on our apps right now. Our iOS app is fairly basic, but it already has a few million downloads. We want to make it awesome. If you&#x27;re a mobile developer we can build a great team around, <i>please</i> reach out. You can&#x27;t find this sort of opportunity in very many places.<p>We&#x27;re hiring engineers (web, mobile, data science), product designers, a community manager, and more. Oh, and if you want to have a great summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we&#x27;re hiring interns too.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> directly (say you saw us on HN!) or feel free to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org with any questions.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machine-learning-measurable-learning\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machin...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...</a>",1385911356

Flow state does not necessarily create sucky product.<p>For the most part, the analogy of the Ford Focus is entirely off base. How many people go directly in the opposite direction, even with a mild understanding of the end goals and a good sense of design? A better analogy would be that it&#x27;s far better to get in the F1 and head as fast as you can in 90% the right direction than piddle along in the focus. You can course correct, or perhaps the client will end up changing their mind a bit when they see your solution.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m missing something, but in a project discovery phase, unless the coder is completely out of the loop, it is much more effective to let software designers design solutions to well defined problems.

It\nwas marketed as for <i>artificial intelligence</i>\nbut, really, as it was created by\nour group at Yorktown Heights,\nwas\nmostly intended to automate monitoring\nand system management for server farms\nand networks.<p>One of my contributions was \narchitecture, algorithms, and code for\n<i>rule-subroutines</i>.  The core of the \nwork was to understand the PL/I stack\nof <i>dynamic descendancy</i> and to exploit\nit to keep the <i>state</i> of the user&#x27;s\nrule subroutine calls that had yet to\nreturn while calling a run-time package\nwith the RETE algorithm and then return\nto the user&#x27;s code with it&#x27;s <i>state</i>\nintact.  It was a fast idea one afternoon\nand then a long night typing.  When I\ngot some sleep and back to the office,\nour programmer trying to finish the\nimplementation of rule subroutines was\ndone that day instead of some weeks,\nand the result was much cleaner.<p>In addition, I cooked up some new ideas\nfor anomaly detection in data from\nthe envisioned server farms and networks.\nIt&#x27;s an ambitious approach to \n<i>behavioral monitoring</i> (try to\nsay what is <i>normal</i> and declare\nanything else as an <i>anomaly</i> and\npotential problem to be investigated --\nas in the old Herve Debar post at\nSANS, such monitoring has had\nfalse alarm rate too high,\nand I solved that problem)\nwhere a user\ngets a knob to turn to select false\nalarm rate exactly in advance.<p>The work was <i>ambitious</i> when I did\nit because it can use quite a lot\nof data; now the cost of so much\ndata is so low that it is from\ntrivial down to no concern.<p>As applied probability, it&#x27;s \na statistical hypothesis test\nthat is both multivariate (use\nmore information and, thus,\nget higher detection rate of real\nproblems) and distribution-free\n(make no assumptions about probability\ndistributions) -- maybe still the\nonly example of a test with these\ntwo properties.<p>The paper was published\nin <i>Information Sciences</i>.  I had some\ndata from a cluster at Allstate\nand showed with that data that the\nfalse alarm rate calculation was\ncorrect.  And with some additional\nsimulated data, showed that the detector\nwas darned sensitive (intuitively)\nto anything different.  Basically\ncould have a checkerboard with normal\nperformance on the white squares \nand anomalies on the black squares,\nand the detector will figure this out,\nincluding if the checkerboard is in\n20 dimensions.  Due to such checkerboard\nexamples, data in fewer dimensions \nwould be useless; so, in this case,\nthe multidimensional aspect was crucial.\nWhile such a checkerboard is unlikely\nin practice, the practical point is that\nthe detector is <i>adaptive</i> to quite\nbizarre normal performance.  Indeed,\nwe should expect that the multidimensional\ngeometric region of normal performance\nwill, often in practice, be essentially\na fractal -- my work does well approximating\nfractals.  Now that there is so much\ndata on real-time performance from\nhigh end server farms and networks,\nmy work should be deployed, but I doubt\nthat it has been.",1385911096

6827474,comment,6827077,6827315,7,0,berberous,,,"Well, obviously there are supposed reasoned justifications for the rise in prices. That&#x27;s true of probably all bubbles. Humans are less rational creatures, than rationalizing creatures. We like stories that convince ourselves we are behaving rationally.<p>Robert Schiller, the Yale economist and bubble-proponent, suggests diagnosing bubbles based on a checklist-based approach similiar to the way depression or other medical issues are diagnosed, with the following indicators:\n  - Sharp increases in the price of an asset like real estate or dot-com shares\n  - Great public excitement about said increases\n  - An accompanying media frenzy\n  - Stories of people earning a lot of money, causing envy among people who aren’t\n  - Growing interest in the asset class among the general public\n  - “New era” theories to justify unprecedented price increases\n  - A decline in lending standards<p>Bitcoin fits the above extremely well. I should note that Eugene Fama shared the Nobel prize with Schiller, but does not believe in the idea of bubbles or Schiller&#x27;s claimed ability to predict them. After all, one might say that Google&#x27;s stock fits the above criteria just as well, but that&#x27;s clearly not a bubble. (I think I side with Schiller on this one though, although Fama raises good points.)<p>As I said in my first post, I agree that Bitcoin may eventually succeed as a currency and gain a high value. But it will be a slow process backed by fundamentals. The exponential growth taking place right now is pure bubble speculation. Very few really care about this future as an &quot;important currency.&quot; Instead, you have people like me. I invested some money. It&#x27;s now worth nearly 10x. I want it to keep going up, and I am currently letting it ride. I tell myself stories that it will replace gold; I read blog posts arguing that if it does it will be worth $10,000+ a coin. But at some point, the tide will begin to turn. Negative stories will increase. There will be price drops. And people like me, who pretend to themselves that they have a reasoned investment thesis, will say fuck it, and cash out in hordes. And from the ashes, we will then see what it can do as a currency. But the speculators are here, rapidly increasing, and will eventually, rapidly flee. (Although I hope I&#x27;m wrong, because I&#x27;m probably going to let my BTC&#x27;s ride one way or the other...it&#x27;s just too much fun being on this roller coaster.)<p>Put simply, I think the question is whether the fundamentals have a serious chance at overtaking the speculators before a big bust occurs. The speculators are increasing exponentially. And for all the talk of merchants beginning to use Bitcoin, or a random pizza or bar accepting bitcoins, the fundamentals don&#x27;t really seem to be there or growing fast enough. I don&#x27;t know anybody that seriously uses it in that manner, except for the few ardent Bitcoin evangelists. (Although if anyone has any interesting data, please link me!). Black markets and gambling sites seems to be the only real sectors seriously using it as a currency.<p>Disclaimer: I could be wrong, and change my opinion on BTC way too often to be trusted. :)",1385910141

The average Zimbabwean worked a <i>lot</i> harder for their Zimbabwean dollars before being forced to switch to other currencies that other people would actually accept.<p>Right now, some people will accept Bitcoins for real goods and services because they believe the chances of currency appreciation in future are greater than the lack of liquidity and threat of price crashes. Since Bitcoin isn&#x27;t reliably convertible into anything else, people&#x27;s willingness to accept it depends on it remaining that way in future (here, it&#x27;s &quot;deflationary&quot; tendencies are actually a big advantage). People <i>need</i> dollars to meet certain financial obligations, whereas they merely <i>want</i> Bitcoins because they seem like an investment.

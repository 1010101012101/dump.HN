So far, we seem to have converged on uranium and plutonium, and while at least uranium is relatively common in the Earth the processing and dredging required to get a useful amount of it, and then the refining to get the useful isotopes from that, is nontrivial.""</i><p>I did not express myself well; this is exactly my point -- the barrier to (U-235 based) nuclear weapons is isotopic enrichment -- very difficult engineering -- and not so much access to natural uranium -- raw materials. So that, should difficult engineering become unexpectedly easy (as with singularity-type scenarios), then would be no major barrier to weapons, as access to uranium cannot possibly be blocked.<p><i>""Thank you for attaching some interesting facts.

Pretty much everyone knows how to use a dropdown or a modal. Bootstrap makes it easy to implement these, and that's really handy. You could do the same with jQuery plugins or CSS snippets, though it would take more time.<p>The bigger aspect of Bootstrap (IMO), and the one that really grabs people's attention, is its distinctive and consistent <i>styling</i>. <i>That's</i> what shouldn't be kept consistent across websites.

The market cornerer will either pay the asking price or relinquish some control of the market.<p>What prevented this from happening is that supplying a months worth of buffs required a lot of avian meat. And avian meat was a pain in the arse to harvest - you had to roam all over the map looking for the changing spawn points and if I remember correctly, you would only have maybe 20 pieces of the resource for every hour hunting - it was seriously time consuming. So I never encountered a hunter who was selling bulk amounts of avian meat - they all sold in dribs and drabs and so had no negotiating power with me. The small amounts they potentially could individually withheld would have almost no impact to my manufacturing -the only way to affect me was if they ganged up, which would have required substantial coordination.<p>I was also very dynamic with my pricing - the amount I set was based on what other vendors offered. With my huge bankroll (thanks to first mover advantage), I trumped any bid and scared other doctors away - they simply knew they couldn't compete.

OS widgets and the use of Bootstrap across the web are very different.<p>OS widgets provide a user familiar with those elements hints and clues about how to use a program. A menu is a menu is a menu no matter the application. Bootstrap provides a very similar framework.<p>The problem is that we don't interact with public facing websites in the same way we interact with websites in the same way as desktop applications. The level of complexity tends to be very different and design is far more important for a website.<p>I can understand using Bootstrap for an admin interface; it provides that same recognizable framework for a user. For a public facing website, however, I think using Bootstrap is almost abhorrent. Whenever I see that very distinct black navigation bar across the top I have an urge to leave a website.<p>I understand that you can of course modify Bootstrap but to be honest I think the design choices are simply wrong for most sites.

The scripts collect all sorts of system data. Things like load average, iowait, data in, data out.<p>They also collect all sorts of info about our custom network daemon. They take all of this info and using netcat, echo and sometimes statsd shove this all into graphite.<p>Having all of this info gives us several advantages. When we notice an issue we are able to track it back in time. We notice an increase in CPU usage at the same time as a sharp increase in data in? Our daemon preformed a bunch of ""foo"" actions at the same time, well obviously something about ""foo"" action is killing the box.<p>In addition to historical data we also can do A/B testing from an operations perspective. Take a couple of boxes split into two groups, tune sysctl ""y"" to x value on all of group A boxes. Turn up the same load and see how sysctl ""y"" affects performance of the box.<p>Because graphite has such a simple api for importing data we can easily expand our scripts push them to the boxes and we have new sources of data.

Any competent EVE trader would have squeezed into your market quite easily, and even have a choice of two methods.<p>The ""Chinese gold farmer"" way is to be in the spaceport all the time and keep outbidding you minimal amounts. At the end of the month, your resource stocks would be bought at the same price, and their quantities proportional to the relative time amounts each of you has spent in the spaceport. So they can sell at the same price as you, or even lower if they value their time less and would accept less profit.<p>The ""lazy"" way (my favorite) requires very little capital and very little time. The idea is to seriously outbid you but only offer to buy small quantities. You will only be able to match this bidding war up to a limit, since you're paying very inflated prices and buying a hundred times more than I do. (If you miscalculate, you'll end up with a huge stock of finished products that you can only sell profitably at ten times the previous price, and people will simply not buy.)

The market cornerer will either pay the asking price or relinquish some control of the market.<p>Since there is no monopoly on buff producers (per the anecdote), the meat miner can lower the price until it sells to a buff producer (whether the cornerer or not).

While they both operate on tuples and work at a higher level than pure Hadoop, they accomplish their goals much differently.Pig uses its own language called Pig Latin (<a href=""http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.9.2/basic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.9.2/basic.html</a>), which is then compiled down into code that interfaces with the Hadoop library. Pangool is much closer to Hadoop, in that you are writing Java. If you look at one of their examples (<a href=""http://pangool.net/introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pangool.net/introduction.html</a>), I get the sense that the developers aim to make Hadoop easier to use, while Pig aims to make data analysis easier to use.<p>These goals are greatly divergent. In Pig, Java code is written to create new functions that can be used for analysis--i.e. Java is written in support of Pig Latin. Pangool focuses instead on extending Hadoop by making the Java code easier to write. This means Pig could potentially be implemented in Pangool, if Pangool were to satisfy the requirements for the task. (Not that I am suggesting that Pig actually be written--it might just be <i>possible</i>, depending on the technical requirements.)<p>Having used Hadoop in the past, I would be more inclined to use Pangool. Parts of Hadoop are poorly written--especially the reliance on singletons--and anything that makes it easier to write code that runs on a Hadoop cluster is a desirable goal in my eyes.

If you release your bootstrap website, users will have to work and over come the barrier of your bland looking site and then decide if it's worth it to try your product.\nPS: The point about lawyers have crappy websites and yet we still use them is because our expectations changes depending on the organization. Do we expect government websites to be wow and dazzle us? Do we expect a new Apple product's website to use bootstrap? Do we expect a 2 month old startup website to be featured on Behance's frontpage?<p>And remember who your early adopters are  if it's people that scours HN or see countless bootstrapped sites, what are they going to think when they see your site?

However quality of documentation for programming tools/languages varies so much that I can understand where this may come from if you have mainly been exposed to the bad kind.<p>Plus sometimes it is nice to have a bit of ""magic"" to do some of the work for you when you have something you need done on a deadline and don't have time to grok the details of everything. It can be useful to go back and try and grok some of the details later but you won't usually grasp this until you experience the pain of working with an incomplete understanding first hand.<p>I have also met programmers who are almost the complete opposite of IDE addicts. Usually people who come from a PHP/Javascript background and have become used to doing everything using EditPad and debugging with echo statements. It's often just as difficult to make these people realise that they could save time and gain more power by looking into more sophisticated tools whether they are parts of an IDE or command line tools.",1331143476
3676385,comment,3676237,3676336,2,0,ivanprado,,," Hi, I'm one of the developers of Pangool. The idea of Pangool is not to be yet another higher level API on top of Hadoop but rather to pose a replacement for the low-level Hadoop Java MapReduce API. Pangool has the same performance and flexibility than that of the Java MapReduce API although it makes several things a lot easier and convenient. There is no tradeoff, just advantages. There will be cases where you'd want to use Pig or Cascading. There will be some other cases where you'd want the flexibility and efficiency of MapReduce. For those cases we conceived Pangool. Nowadays only very advanced Hadoop users could write efficiently-performing MapReduce Jobs. Pangool hides all the advanced boilerplate code needed for writing highly efficient MapReduce jobs, making things like secondary sorting or reduce-side joins extremely easy.",1331143469

So far, we seem to have converged on uranium and plutonium, and while at least uranium is relatively common in the Earth the processing and dredging required to get a useful amount of it, and then the refining to get the useful isotopes from <i>that</i>, is nontrivial.<p>Engineering and fast computers are great and all, and will get you arbitrarily close to the physical limits--but we're there right now, and physics says you aren't getting a centrifuge with meaningful output in your garage.<p>More troubling is the idea that frankly we've had the technology to build sports cars in our homes for decades and decades now.

Now do the machining on the rest of the device to make it function correctly (have fun with the berylium dust, if you go that route).

Most of their crap are severely under-styled.

Bootstrap makes it amazingly easy for those developers who want to build an MVP.  Tweaks are nice, but if you have zero design skills, they may or may not be necessary.<p>One would be a fool to simply ignore a web project because they were built on Bootstrap.  If it's not relevant to your needs, sure, ignore it.  If it can help solve your problems, pay attention to the app and don't worry about the design so much.  If it makes a ton of money, I'm sure they can re-invest some of that back into making it look better.",1331143232

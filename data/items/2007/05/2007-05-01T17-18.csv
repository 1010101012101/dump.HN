Well, don't worry about it if it's too much work.  I'll probably end up using one of the pay services suggested in this page.",1178042206

If it fits into some grand vision I'm sure there are creative people who can integrate it somehow.<p>I have attempted a chrome effect before and I feel without further training I won't match the pros. My designs are plain, and I like to merge text into the picture. I don't have good samples with me but here are two.<p><a href=""http://www.withmsg.com/1.gif"">http://www.withmsg.com/1.gif</a> <a href=""http://www.withmsg.com/2.jpg"">http://www.withmsg.com/2.jpg</a><p>rather obscure, but the text reads to ""pktw.""
if you like this style, yes I have one or two sketches in mind. If you'd like to blend some text in, the first letter maybe, I need to know that. Finally, if you want a vector file I probably won't be working fast -- because sadly I don't have AI. And I'm very unfamiliar with inkscape. What I'll end up doing is roughly tracing a paper sketch. You'd need to get somebody to smooth out the edges after that.",1178040037

""Co-locate box at Sprocket Data in Dallas for 6 months ($60/mo for 100 GB traffic, 100 mbps burst)""<p>Because it's too expensive when you're just starting out. I could afford $60/mo, for instance (because I'm older and have lots of kizzash) but I'm hosted for $8/mo with 1.5TB of throughput.<p>If your site gets much traffic, you'll be over 60GB before you know it. :-o",1178039618

It's really straightforward, and arguments about information wanting to be free don't really work in a courtroom setting.

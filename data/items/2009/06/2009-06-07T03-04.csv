645509,comment,645341,645454,0,0,Empact,,,"> California's emphasis on citizen democracy<p>Yeah, but there are much better ways to do it.  I'd recommend a substantial decrease in the Citizen / Legislator ratio.  That gives regular citizens greater access to their legislature, while giving its members the power and responsibility necessary for them to invest themselves in its decisions, and make a more direct case to the constituency for the more responsible policy decisions.<p>For example New Hampshire has<p>* 400 representatives for<p>* 1.3 million people, or roughly<p>* 3,000 constituents/legislator (illustrated: <a href=""http://www.biblebaptistchurchmoldova.com/evangelism/images/mpp-0016.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biblebaptistchurchmoldova.com/evangelism/images/m...</a>)<p>Meanwhile, California has only<p>* 80 representatives for<p>* 38 million people, or roughly<p>* 475,000 constituents/legislator (illustrated: <a href=""http://kashmirwatch.com/postnews/data/upimages/eidgah22aug2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kashmirwatch.com/postnews/data/upimages/eidgah22aug2....</a>)<p>New Hampshire citizens have over 150x the access to their state representatives, and those 400 legislators have 5 times the personal experience with laws and regulation to bring to the table.<p>Now you may say it's crazy to suggest that California should have 12,000 state legislators, but I disagree.  The practicalities which have capped large-scale decision-making have largely been wiped away with the invention of modern electronic communication.  And having those 12,000 means you could keep them in their home neighborhoods, rather than call them out to Albany.  This way there's always <i>someone</i> within a reasonable distance that you can speak to directly.<p>Interestingly, with the position California is in, I'd think this idea (or a more moderate version of it, say 2,000 legislators) might have a chance at making it.  That is, if people make a serious push for it in the new constitution.",1244347139

645497,comment,645388,645388,0,0,gabriel,,,"I was recently re-reading the ""regrets"" pamphlet by <i>n+1</i> magazine (link at bottom) where the premise was to get a round-table discussion of some ""intellectuals"" and ask them what they regret about their education in order to provide a guide for current students in ideas of ""literature, philosophy, and thought.""<p>Some of the participants went to the Ivy League, but all of them went to highly respectable schools. There were a few points that I'd like to share.<p>Quite a few of the participants had a feeling like they screwed up big time in choices in their education. Not necessarily about the choice of school, but in, for example, choosing the English department instead of Literature and end up studying Theory rather than readings and after a few years they found out they missed out on <i>Anna Karenina</i> in favor of Foucault. This was to the extent that some of them claimed to go to masters school to make up for what they didn't do as an undergraduate, and regretted that too.<p>Another idea that they quickly agreed on is that the very nature of a regret is to notice what choices you <i>should</i> have made, and clearly it is too late to do anything about it. Yet, some of the participants were reluctant to even call them regrets. How can you call your life a regret? This is a group of people where there was no question that reading the right book at the right time would (and did) change their life, and it really wasn't a question of ""for better or worse"", but they would learn their lessons and are the better for it.<p>I suppose I'm talking about making decisions, reflecting on those decisions over time (sometimes it takes years, decades even), and then gaining a modicum of wisdom.<p>Feeling inferior would seem to me a common sentiment. Hasn't everyone had this feeling before? You feel like you missed out on something you may have not known existed until you had the years to figure out it was even there. Yet, I don't think you should deny yourself the line of thought that this would take you down, and it may take a long time, but I think you need to turn these feelings around to find a genuine calling/relaxedness of what you are here to do.<p>No affiliation with the publishers, but I highly recommend the $9 ""What We Should Have Known: Two Discussions"" (aka regrets) pamphlet: <a href=""http://www.nplusonemag.com/pamphlet-two"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nplusonemag.com/pamphlet-two</a>.

If people are getting paroled because we just need more information about them, then that seems sensible. If it's just a matter of resource constraints, though, there are probably some sensible reforms.<p>The trickier problem though is just what do we do with bad people that nobody wants. If we don't want to admit them and no one else will take them, can we then indefinitely detain them or are we obligated by some common sympathy to eventually let them in?

645486,comment,645341,645341,0,0,quisxt,,,"Yeah, right.<p>California's problem is that we keep on spending money like it's flowing in like water, yet the flow was greatly reduced 30 years ago with the passage of proposition 13.  Instead of trying to live within our means, we voted people into office who either wanted to spend more, xor reduce taxes and then we made the problem much worse by passing a slew of costly initiatives without being willing to raise the money to fund them fully.  So here we are.  The governor screwed us, the state senate and legislature screwed us, but ultimately, we screwed ourselves, and now we're going to have to pay for it.<p>As someone who lived most of my 38 years in this state, went to UC, and has the joy of living in one of the most beautiful places on earth, it makes me profoundly sad to see what we have done to ourselves.",1244345224
645485,comment,645388,645429,0,0,rg,,,"Having lived in both the US and the UK, I'd observe that the prestige of one's university counts for MUCH more in the UK.  To an American it is unbelieveable how much Brits focus on where they went to school (at all levels) rather than their abilities--and they are correct to do so, because other Brits use schools and universities as vital credentials.  It's an aspect of the class system in the UK which doesn't exist in the same way in the US (note also the discussion of ""working class background"" versus ""upper middle class culture""--not at all the same in the US).  Someone from the UK might well obsess about a degree from an elite university, but in the US any good degree gets you over the threshold and able to compete on equal terms.",1244345163

It can be hard to get honest feedback that hasn't been softened by politeness, so I attempt to provide it, even at the risk of being seen as a prick.<p>The rebuttals were instructive, by the way. One person chided me thus:<p><i>""You could try couching it in some politeness""</i><p>And I suppose it is easy enough for me to do that. I am usually extremely polite. But is that really what you want? ""Polite feedback only?"" If that's what you want, ask your Mom.<p>Despite what you might think, I do try to be honest and, more importantly, useful. My actual, real-life reaction to that company name was visceral - I <i>really</i> hated it. I tried to get that across; it was pretty late, and I was somewhat drunk (hehe), maybe I dialed up the harshness a little too high but reading it again I don't think I was that far off the mark. And certainly better than misrepresenting myself for the sake of protecting feelings.<p>Obviously there is a balance to be found between worthless feelgood encouragement and worthless destructive ""that sucks"" snark. Perhaps in this instance I went too far to the latter. But at the same time, look at the whole thread. No-one else even mentioned the name. Was it because they all love it? Or because something so fundamental is off-limits?<p>It cost me 20 mod points or something to get that point across, not that I care about that, but still - now you know that some people think the name sucks and it might be a problem. I am satisfied with the outcome.<p>Do you really want everyone to be following the principle ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all""?",1244344973

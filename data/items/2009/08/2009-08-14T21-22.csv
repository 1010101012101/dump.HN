Aside from having the widest support across platforms, and being syntactically similar to many other languages, it's the closest you can get to understanding how computers work at a low level without dropping into asm. Frankly, knowing these things will make you a better programmer.<p>That said there is definitely a benefit to exposing students to higher level languages, both for productivity in solving more complex problems and understanding what the syntax and expressions of these languages have to offer. And by higher language I don't mean C++ :)",1250287146

Lot of designers and developers (creatives) in the area.<p>What is missing?
For one. Statup types. Most people I have come across in Portland don't seem to be the type that would build companies. People seem to be working on mostly side-projects. The community is very ""social media"" driven and there is not a lot of chatter going around on about how do you build businesses?<p>Second, would be. Mentorship. It has been fairly difficult for us to find people who have been there and done it. People who have built companies in the past. There are no VC's here. Very few angels here, at least angels who are focused in the web/tech space.<p>I think Portland is a great place to start a project. Potentially meet co-founders.

The BMI is another (albeit much saner) manifestation of this desire to have magic numbers.<p>We're also enamoured with single-focus solutions: eat less tortillas and get fit, eat a stalk of celery every two hours, chug a glass of water before a meal, whatever the magazine rack at the grocery store tells us.<p>I am of the opinion that this is all badly misguided, especially because it needn't be that complicated. Eat on a regular schedule, in portions that leave you full but not satiated. Try to buy more raw food products and less highly-processed stuff. Include different types of food in each meal. <i>Exercise regularly</i> (there really is no substitute for this). Set your goals with yardsticks like cardiovascular endurance (for the layman, ""can I jog up a flight of stairs without gasping?"") instead of trying to lose x number of pounds in a week.<p>So no, I can't give you an exact answer. It will probably be centuries before nutritional science can do so, if ever.

The whole point of the article is that it currently isn't, but is instead buried in small sites that focus on presentation and analysis.

763889,comment,763035,763842,0,0,pcc,,,"I'm not by any stretch saying that academic research is pure, at all.  But I don't see how that is relevant.<p>It feels akin to my surprise in other threads where some people insist e.g. that there is inherently something ""bad"" when a company like MS releases source to the linux community, because they didn't do it purely for giving things away and there must be some ulterior motive.<p>Why does it matter?  I guess it matters to people if they perceive the world as a 0-sum game, so there is always a ""take"" side to the ""give"".<p>But I don't see it proven that the world indeed functions as a 0-sum game. We are all scratching our own itches, we perhaps all have ulterior motives in ""giving things away"" and yet we can earn a living while the world at large benefits from the fact that we did give things away.<p>For example:<p>Some time ago I had to add code to the linux kernel because of problems in autodetecting the volume resolution of a particular audio codec IC.  Either no one had discovered it before or it was not a priority for other people, since there was no fix for it at the time.  But it was a problem for my client, so they paid to fix it. There was no hesitancy in open sourcing the patch, since it is a building block and them giving it up has 0 implication on their business.<p>Also they had an ulterior motive in doing so, because having the fix in mainline meant they would not have to keep merging it in while staying up to date with kernels, and would not have to worry if certain code structures change at some future point, etc.<p>Since they had run into the problem it is likely that someone else would also have run into it at some point; and by that patch being available, someone else is going to be saved some time and expense (except for the $0.00012 or whatever ""distribution"" fee to download the code), and maybe that person gets to spend an extra hour with his kid.<p>Who loses in this case?<p>Or more recently where a client had a problem with an SoC where there is a timing problem in the macrocell relating to the interrupt controller, and boards based on that SoC would mysteriously stop working under some conditions.  Again this was a problem, they paid to get a software fix for it, and the fix will be submitted to the community.  Again there is an ulterior motive, because more people will get to test & debug the fix on a wider variety of environments which will save the client time in the long run;  and again this is going to save headaches, hassles, money and possibly lawsuits for other parties.<p>So in both cases an ""impure"" ""giving away for free but with ulterior motives"" and everyone stands to gain?<p>Obviously academia is of a different scale, but it seems to me more of the same thing -- hey we need to publish in order to improve our career prospects, but how does anyone loose from this?<p>And to answer your question:  it varied.  On one short project I purchased six papers (iirc);  on one multi-year project I purchased one.  In the latter case much of the research had already been embodied into available standards, and often times it was possible to pop an email right to the author.<p>Many years ago I was doing research in TCP over satellite connections in Africa; shot an email to Mark Allman in the USA, and received their full experimental TCP Vegas implementation by return email.  Who looses here?<p>I just don't know how else to phrase this;  we all keep going on with our work but there are many things we can actually share (that may directly benefit us and appear as ulterior motives); that ends up making life easier.<p>Surely this is way more efficient than the alternative (not sharing), even if you have the ""middleman/distribution channel"" taking a nickle?",1250285503

They are very much a part of REST. How the real world uses them has no bearing on their validity. This has to be managed by better informing the real world not by questioning the very notion itself. Linking via hypermedia is an essence of the HATEOAS constraint of REST. Both are orthogonal yet complementary aspects of REST. A discussion can be had about one without necessarily talking about the other as this blog post does.<p>On the other hand transparency vs. opaqueness has nothing to do with REST API design per se. All REST recommends is that clients shouldn't design themselves to assume specific semantics into the URI substructure nor should the services guarantee them. However structured design URIs do not at all fall foul of REST from an API design perspective, and help both development and debugging substantially.<p>I suspect you've introduced both issues related to Client API usage and used them to question serverside API design. The issues are not incorrect but the level of abstraction at which you choose to address them is something I would differ with.",1250284611

The evolutionary standpoint certainly supports this - we evolved as primarily hunter-gatherers who would manage to kill an antelope once every two weeks or something. Agriculture changed our diets significantly, and not necessarily for the healthier (an interesting writer on this subject is Jared Diamond).",1250284587

In fact, browsers as a rule seem to be evolving closer to operating systems with time.<p>For the time being, I find that when there is a web version and a nonweb version, the nonweb version is virtually always more feature rich, more robust, and more polished than the web version.  That could easily change in the future.<p>One thing that is unlikely to change is that I will have more control over the nonweb version, including amoungst other things the ability to refuse/ignore certain upgrades and to know that my data is staying on my local machine and not being sent to third parties at all.  This is normally trivial for most things, but it can be very important for mission critical items where consistency, stability, privacy, and customization are more important that being on the bleeding edge.<p>Of course, it is possible good solutions to even those last problems will be found, but I do not think that one is on the horizon yet.<p>In short, I think that there is a place for both and that for the near future more things will (and should) move onto the web.

It if was taking photos from the by-gone video stream the exposure would be off in rapidly changing light situations. The shutter lag seems evident to me when I tried shooting an analog clock. Much of the perceived shutter lag is actually post processing the image to something that it can display.

163861,comment,163826,163826,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Lindsay Mac has a song on her upcoming CD about business and change and rethinking our definitions of progress:<p><i>It's 1902 and the sky is not blue /
it's the familiar color of steel /
and the smoke from the stacks /
that will lay down the tracks /
of a country's birth at the wheel.</i><p><i>Suspended on high
with suspenders on tight
is a man connecting the beams /
of a building so big
it will rip up the seams
of a thousand competitor's dreams.</i><p><i>Intense fields of grain /
yes it's perfectly tamed /
for as far as the eye can see /
now a view from above /
where the prairie once was /
is perfectly right angled beams.</i><p><i>When he gets done from spraying
he finds the kids playing
in the pond with nets and fish line /
and they hoist up their prize
of a frog with three eyes
as they dance with delight at their find.</i><p><i>I'm finding it tough
to have just enough
when there's so much out there to try /
my affair with machines
is all for the dream
I might have just a little more time. When I tell you goodnight through the beam of a satellite
it seems like an awfully big bet /
to cut all the anchors to say its just human nature
it's all in the name of progress.</i><p><a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=zwAk6yusvFY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=zwAk6yusvFY</a><p>She also has a song called Lucy, which is about quitting your day job and following your dreams.

Perhaps you're thinking about it too analytically. Take a more dumbed down approach, and be more critical of people's lives in general. You'll come up with a horde of relevant issues to remedy.",1208238481

We talked to a lot of people but could only find anyone who was interested in a very small (<10K) or very large (>1M) investment. That's not what we wanted. At this point we have not taken a cent of investment and it has worked out fine, we're doing great on our own and it feels nice to own 100% of our company. But there is definitely a market for this medium sized investment that is not being fulfilled at all.",1208237188

163830,comment,163083,163782,0,0,wanorris,,,"Well, yes. But that isn't always the most useful paradigm for thinking about some of those businesses, and it doesn't always apply. When I go buy an iPod at an Apple store, what customer makes money off the purchase? When Safeway sells me a pork roast, what customer makes money off the purchase? When I subscribe to a premium account at ESPN, is there a customer that makes money off the purchase?<p>For manufacturers, it is certainly important to develop a value proposition for distributors and retailers. For ad-driven media businesses, it is critically important to develop a value proposition for advertisers. But it's at least as important to make something that people want. If you have a product that nobody wants, it doesn't matter how good the retail markup is. If you have a media property with no eyeballs, what good will really brilliant advertising packages do potential advertisers?",1208236068

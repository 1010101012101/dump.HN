The delay seems to have very little impact on the long-term success of the company. What really matters there is just whether people want to buy the cars, which this news does not have much bearing on (except maybe that people are more likely to buy the cars if they are perceived as paragons of quality... like the public perceives iPhones, etc).<p>The supercharger announcement was way above and beyond anything I expected.

And not well integrated at all. With google maps its just get directions, where from, where to, what type of transportation, and then the arrow button (go).  With apple it's get directions, then choose bus, then where from, where to, go, wait for the App Store to open, find the routing app you've purchased in the list, tap route, hope that the app got the directions correctly from the maps app (this step I've never completed successfully).

My main problem (which perhaps is not totally clear from my post, linked in the article) is that there are certain historical conventions about what a database should be. In particular, a database will not have the following default behavior:<p>- return from a write call silently, when the data wasn't written and will not be.<p>If you are going to break conventions on a multi-decade tradition, there should be warnings everywhere. Not just the Downloads page, but during installation (which is harder to ignore, as the Download page is not seen by people like me who use package managers).<p>The 32-bit issue is worse. There's no excuse for not warning people that the server they just started is a crippled data store limited to 2GB.<p>Again, I like MongoDB. Given my experience with software development, those issues are telltale signs of a product in its infancy. Hence the ""10 years"" title of my post, which of course is hyperbole.

Not 'worrying' about managing schemas is one thing, but actually leveraging the fact that your objects can have different fields is another. I have worked on projects that did need to store objects with different fields together but it seems to be a rare case.<p>From what I've seen, most projects actually have pretty standard objects with specific fields. People just don't like feeling constrained but in the end I don't think managing a schema is difficult at all. I actually like the safety and performance you get when you put in the effort.<p>I think the single most useful thing to see when starting a new dev job somewhere are the database schemas. If done properly, it will essentially tell you the story of that company and their data. You can think up questions and get answers such as <i>""Is it possible for a Customer to have multiple Orders? Can a product have more than one Review?""</i> (Stupid examples but they illustrate the kinds of relationships which are asked about all the time).",1348589943

And this doesn't just apply to cancer drugs, it applies to NSAIDs and all sorts of other garden variety treatments. I realize there are limited resources, but the end result is that the vast majority of the elderly (by far the biggest consumers of drugs) are taking medicines that have never been tested for safety or efficacy in people like them.<p>Also, it's not just SSRIs. There are a wide range of psychiatric and non-psychiatric drugs that are either no more effective than placebos or generics: SSRIs, benzos, ADHD drugs, anti-psychotics, statins, calcium-channel blockers, evergreens like nexium and clarinex, claritin, COX-2 inhibitors (now pulled from the market), etc.<p>Of the 20 most-prescribed drugs overall, it looks like just under half are no more effective than placebos or generics.[1] And if you look at the top 25 psychiatric drugs, something like 22 or 23 of them are no more effective than placebos or generics for longterm use, which is the vast majority of the usage.<p>[1] Statins are arguably useful for people who have already had a heart attack, but the vast majority of people taking them don't fall into this category, and it's not even clear whether they're really helpful for people who have had one. Meanwhile, longterm use basically causes at least mild dementia and muscle problems in everyone, meaning there is a negligible chance of benefit that's vastly lower than the benefit from giving up smoking or even moderate exercise, whereas there is basically a 100% risk of harm. Also, there is zero evidence that the new statins are better than the old statins, so even if you believe that statins are effective then my original argument still stands since there's no evidence that they're better than the generic ones.",1348589504

Over the years that has repeatedly manifested as problems no one should ever expect a database engine to have if properly designed. There is a reasonable point where you should not have to read the documentation to see if your database has a basic design flaw; there is an assumption of competent architecture for its nominal use cases.<p>MongoDB has improved in this regard over time and many other popular NoSQL (and SQL) databases have similar problems.

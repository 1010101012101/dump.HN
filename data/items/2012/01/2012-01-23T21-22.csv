3502347,comment,3501366,3501548,23,0,_dps,,,"Agreed re:being weaselly about your number. Given that <i>someone</i> has to say a number first (absent weird note-trading schemes), not saying a number first is (game theoretically) tantamount to saying ""I'm hoping you'll unwittingly make an offer better than what I believe I could credibly demand"". In complex multi-dimensional negotiations this can be totally reasonable (when there are 20 different key terms to negotiate, saying ""I think you'll make an anchoring mistake first"" is not at all unreasonable). Salary negotiations are usually not multidimensional since the position/title is usually fixed and the official story is that you'll work at some fixed level of output commensurate with that title and not connected to pay (so you can't say ""I'll accept $X but I'll probably slack a lot"").<p>From the employer's position the ""I think you're likely to botch it"" bet is not a bad one: employees don't know the employer's value function for the work, but the employer can have a pretty decent model of the employee's value function for steady income (tip: eliminate your short-term need for steady income and many negotiations become a lot easier).<p>For the employee, hoping for an accidental or poorly-informed over-offer is rarely justified. Employers usually have many past negotiation experiences and many sources of information for what other employers are paying, whereas employees usually have few.  Similarly, the employer's side of the exchange is primarily liquid and easily quantified (cash+benefits) whereas the employee's side is poorly quantified and illiquid (the employer usually can't directly ""sell out"" your past labor and partially recoup if he decides it was worth less than he expected).<p>Expecting employers to err on the side of overpaying with any sort of frequency seems theoretically hard to justify, and that is certainly not in line with my experience. Unless you know the employer wants <i>you</i> specifically (as opposed to any instance of the class you represent), I think it's almost always better for employees to open with what they consider a high number and let the employers try to talk them down.",1327355959

Contrary to how it was portrayed, the Obama administration’s threatened veto of the NDAA rested largely on the assertion that they did not need a law vesting them with indefinite detention powers because they already have full power to detain people without a trial: not because any actual law expressly vested that power, but because the Bush and Obama DOJs both claimed the 2001 AUMF silently (“implicitly”) authorized it and deferential courts have largely acquiesced to that claim.<p>> That’s more or less what happened with the SOPA fight. [It] sends a very clear message when citizens celebrate a rare victory in denying the Government a power it seeks - the power to shut down websites without a trial - only for the Government to turn around <i>the very next day</i> and shut down one of the world’s largest and best-known sites. Whether intended or not, the message is unmistakable: <i>Congratulations, citizens, on your cute little “democracy” victory in denying us the power to shut down websites without a trial: we’re now going to shut down one of your most popular websites without a trial.</i><p>> (2) The U.S. really is a society that simply no longer believes in due process: once the defining feature of American freedom that is now scorned as some sort of fringe, radical, academic doctrine. That is not hyperbole. Supporters of both political parties endorse, or at least tolerate, all manner of government punishment without so much as the pretense of a trial, based solely on government accusation: imprisonment for life, renditions to other countries, even assassinations of their fellow citizens. Simply uttering the word Terrorist, without proving it, is sufficient.

I have seen case after case where interviewers hold applicants to a standard that they themselves do not maintain in their code.

Or using CCTV traffic cameras for a live-tracking of tagged license plates. The question is would this tracking actually constitute a search. Because a warrant doesn't have to be issued for an undercover cop to follow a car, only probable cause. So does 'probable cause' extend to digital tracking through a CCTV grid, satellite or combination? That's where it gets creepy to me, because IMO this likely won't constitute a search.",1327354415

Mostly due to a sudden spike in interest, but there were also rumors of ""hacker attacks"" (DDoS), which certainly contributed to the whole mess. On the Sunday morning of Jan 22nd, both ACTA and the alleged hacker attacks were main headlines in all the media. Reporters were interviewing experts and NGOs. Sunday talk shows were talking about ACTA.<p>ACTA suddenly came into mainstream public debate.<p>The government spokesman sought to reassure the public, that ACTA won't be rushed and will be consulted. A government minister publicly admitted that the treaty wasn't handled appropriately. Despite these attempts to calm the situation, the internet community remained in the rage mode, journalists kept digging into ACTA and many government websites were, well, unresponsive (notably the Ministry of Defense). On Monday morning (Jan 22nd) the website of the Prime Minister was spectacularly defaced: http://bit.ly/ziSMLZ    \n(The YouTube film posted there is a spoof of the announcement of Martial Law in 1981, a grim memory for every Polish citizen old enough to remember.) Also, a street demonstration against ACTA is planned in Warsaw for Jan 24th. The number of people declaring participation on Facebook shot from 10,000 to over 30,000 in past 48h. http://www.facebook.com/events/231718760242341/<p>Today (Jan 23rd) the government announced that it will follow through with the signing on Thursday, but assured that the treaty still needs to be ratified by the Parliament, and before that happens (in over one year's time) the topic will be thoroughly discussed in public and consulted with all interested parties.<p>So while we don't have a win for ACTA opponents yet, we do have something no other country had so far: government admission that the problem exists, awareness among the wide public and battles still to be fought.",1327353935

IIRC the timestamp between my emailing to say I'd handle the rewrite (rather than there be a delay and have someone else do it, which would have put us behind deadline) and my delivering it was less than 35 minutes. I even got an email back that evening saying he was amazed, and also sending me the word document with the corrections on, which ended up being purely comma placement (which was a long running joke between us, as comma placement is generally where the author would naturally pause and we both had very different speaking styles, which often descended into a ""changing comma position changes sentence meaning"" debate).<p>However, over the christmas break I automatically switched back to night owl. Every day I was up between 9/10am and was in bed around 4am. It was great, although my creative productivity didn't see a spike.

Aftermarket support and/or production issues mid-stream are the bane of our existence. When it goes well everyone deserves the credit.<p>Now that I have that experience if I saw a non sales person place something like the above on their resume I would be very intrigued. Not because they're claiming responsibility (which I don't read into that) but because it says to me that they see their place in the whole system and how they contribute. That is really rare and really valuable. Like you say it's harder to see it when you're not in front of the customer, but if you do see it I think it means you're probably an ""A"" player.<p>For example, I used to sell heavy equipment to the concrete industry. In the back shop there was a manager of a unit that did about 25% of the work that needed to be done to build any machine that I would sell. He didn't have any direct contact with the customers. He didn't sit in on any sales meetings, and didn't have a very good idea of the forecast that was coming (unfortunately). He was absolutely critical to making each sale happen and each customer happy and he seemed to understand this. Without him it would have been very difficult to land the deals that we did. He absolutely deserves to place that he was critical to building an $8_figs business area on his resume. And by doing so I think it shows that he has vision beyond his area. I'd work with him again in a second.<p>He was ""far"" from the money but it didn't seem that way to me. He could just write on his resume that he was a Tool and Die Maker that managed a small machine shop of about 6 people. And it's true, but it doesn't do him justice.",1327353375

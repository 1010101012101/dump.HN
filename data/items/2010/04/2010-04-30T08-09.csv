Streaming services should be <i>subscription</i> services. Just <i>don't do</i> this. Let the industry know that if you're to purchase something, you should have infinite access to it — otherwise it should be a subscription service.<p>Btw, Apple probably wouldn't buy a streaming service unless they're planning to offer one themselves. Not that it changes your situation in any way. Just saying that they probably didn't do it just to shut it down.",1272617952

Substantively, Narayen didn't offer much we haven't heard Adobe say before, but his frustration with Apple is palpable even in summary form: he called Jobs' points a ""smokescreen,"" said Flash is an ""open specification,"" and further said Apple's restrictions are ""cumbersome"" to developers and have ""nothing to do with technology."" What's more, he also said Jobs' claims about Flash affecting battery life are ""patently false,"" and suggested that any Flash-related crashes on OS X have more to do with Apple's operating system than Adobe's software.""<p>Haven't watched the video, but it sounds like Adobe is giving more than just a ""market will decide"" response.",1272617425

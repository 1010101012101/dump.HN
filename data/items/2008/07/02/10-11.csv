They crawl lots of other file formats, so if you can manage to crawl flash, what made you think Google wouldn't be able to?<p>Maybe you could still survive as a specialized flash search engine? With Google, you get just everything lumped together, at your site, I know I am only searching flash.",1214993674

Shortcuts for expression.  \nLanguages will continue to become more dynamic.  \nIt's really a gradient from ""artificial language"" to ""natural language"".  \nThe evolution of programming languages has them approaching natural language as higher-level languages are developed (as opposed to, say, assembly), but it's rather silly to think that the ideal for an artificial language would ever be to embody the state of a natural language.  \nWill artificial language ever embody natural language?\nWhat happens when the utility of artificial languages exceeds that of natural languages?\nWill our daily conversations one day be held in Ruby 3.1?<p>- ""Make me a sandwich.""\n~ ""Make it yourelf.""\n- ""Sudo make me a sandwich.""\n~ ""Okay.""",1214993325
233965,comment,232731,233020,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"The subjunctive mood is dying pretty quickly, along with ""whom"" and ""shall"".  ""If X was"" is already used quite commonly in hypothetical constructs, even among native english speakers.  Yes, technically, ""if X was"" is a question about X's past, not a supposition about X's  future, but english is ""as she is spoke"" :)<p>Another generation or two, and it'll be gone.  No use crying over linguistic evolution.  Static languages belong in the dustbin of history, and that's where they eventually end up.<p>As High Lord of the English Language, I'll allow the use of past tense here.",1214993250

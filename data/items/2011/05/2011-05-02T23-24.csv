""But, they can add advertisements later!"" No they can't. Adding advertisements to Twitter will destroy their brand and everything that makes them ""cool.""<p>2) No clear picture on their profits and revenue. Profitable companies or companies with a solid revenue model have nothing to hide. There's no reason to hide your money situation if you're successful or have a successful strategy. Twitter doesn't. Their strategy relies on selling to the VC community, not selling to users.<p>3) Buying up competitors before you're posting profits means twitter's only asset (users) are hard to maintain control of.",1304380732

The point of floating point is to have the same accuracy (number of meaningful digits) independently of its amplitude, but that means that their precision is indeed not uniform (near 1, 64 bits float has a precision of ~ 1e-16, near 100000, near 1e-11, etc...).<p>In that sense, saying that floating point suck shows a lack of knowledge about them, since the observed behavior by the OP is exactly what they have been designed for.

2508408,story,,,1,0,warezw3b,"The True Importance Of A Website...",,"Its been an interesting journey on the so called, ""Interweb"" the last month I've been on my cyber adventure into the world through the eyes of a webmaster. I've practiced SEO tactics, built backlinks, joined with affiliate sites with the same niche.  However, on this mission I there is one thing in particular I had a problem with finding ""the right one"" and resulted in me choosing to cancel and go with a different decision quite a few times.<p>What is this you ask? The web hosting! You can have the best html built, custom coded, SEO friedly website in the WORLD, but without good hosting services then your website is merely nothing! This is very true, as when it comes down to it, EVERYTHING depends on your hosting provider and its services.<p>Think of your hosting provider as the ""Heart"" of your website, and your files, folders, ect as the websites ""skeletol system"". Without the heart beating the bones, muslce, and even brain cannot function correctly! Poor or bad hosting services with your great website could lose you hundreds if not thousands of potential customers! When a guests visits your website he/she is NOT going to want to sit around for 2-3 minutes for EACH page to load! Eventually the potential customer will get frustrated and leave. This goes for poor uptime as well, if a member returns and see's that the websites hosting is completely down, thus making all of its content unaccessible! You will QUICKLY lose alot of traffic, trust me i learner FIRST HAND!<p>After trial and error several times, and even loosing money from a few crooked websites who promised refunds but did not fulfil their promise!(be careful) I finally stumbled upon a type of hosting company I had never heard of. 
The words ""HostxPros"" with the subtitle, ""Professional Offshore Web Hosting"". I did some research, found only a few reviews that weren't bad. I decided to check out the prices next, and to my huge surprise the prices were very cheap! Baffled by the prices i decided to do some research on this so called ""Offshore Web Hosting"". From what I was able to come up with, Offshore Web Hosting is simply hosting servers which are located  offshore(obviously), where laws permit a few more laws  as far as ""whats allowed"" on your website.<p>Don't freak out, it doesnt allow anything out of the ordinary from the web or bad in anyway. I have found out that the MAIN reason websites use offshore web hosting services is because the prices are way CHEAPER and it allows forums owners to make forums that use a technique called ""warez linking"" This is where forum owners make forums based on members posting ""warez LINKS"" to other places where they can download warez or what not. Although they allow the linking of warez, offshore it is still illegal to directly host warez on any web server and or website(Just like the USA).<p>I conclude this article with this: 
If your looking for CHEAP but very reliable hosting services to fit into your budget, then offshore web hosting is a great service to go with. I found that a majority of BIG , KNOWN, websites use offshore hosting not for the permitted laws, but simply for the outstsanding services at such a cheap rate. I guess its the conversion rate, or our money may be worth more in some offshore locations where these hosting companies are!<p>If you need recommendation : I currently host all my websites now on a very nice offshore server with 99.9% uptime and great 24/7 customer support to members AND non members :)!

IMO one of the main reasons for performing some sort of redirection, kissing the boo-boo, etc is to find out if they are actually injured. In my experience my son may still indicate that his boo boo hurts a bit but he remains calm and verbalizes that fact. I've seen some parents freak out and dwell on the incident and go on and on while the child is sobbing. I think it is better to not make a big out of it, get the child calm by taking their mind off the incident, then attend to the injury if needed. What is worse...

These studies help narrow down possible genetic areas of interest for other researchers.<p>As they are population based studies, they are of no use clinically at all.

The research they use to make their findings is not applicable to single cases yet they claim it is.

And I may misremember stuff, so don't cite me too closely.<p>Benchmarking is very difficult, and not just in JS. I worked on PHP before, and benchmarking was crap there too. Same in Lua [0]. Same in Python until the Unladen Swallow team packaged up some real-life applications. Even in Java, things were bad. They had SpecJVM98, and it so mischaracterized real Java programs that the Dacapo group went and formed and built benchmarks so they could optimize their research correctly.<p>What is an ideal web benchmark? Tough question. Parts of Sunspider and V8 tried to look at what the web was and distil it into a useful benchmark - that's a good start [5]. Kraken tried instead to look forward at what the web might be, even though people aren't doing that stuff just yet - that's good too. Perhaps what the web is <i>now</i> would be good, but we don't have anything like that [1] [2].<p>Add to this that benchmarking is inherently hard, so hard that it's its own research area. How do you weight various benchmarks to produce the really useful <i>single number</i> that we all want to see? That's kinda hard, and back when I read research on this, I didn't see a particularly useful answer.<p>Let's consider what we'd love to have. Run a web page for a little while, record it somehow, and package that up so that it can be reproduced in a useful way [3]. So what should go in it? I mainly use gmail, google reader, bugzilla, hacker news, and small amounts of other sites. What if you read nothing but Jezebel and Facebook? Will my benchmark help you? Will my benchmark even help me in 6 months after those sites are updated? Whose view of the web is the right one, at which time, and how will we coordinate that into a benchmark?<p>Which brings us back to the original post. That's benchmarking a decompressor, ported from C, which doesn't sound like a great real-world application to me. Its hot-loop seems to be string appending, which Firefox is great at because of ropes [4]. We actually have a few benchmarks like this. One of the V8 benchmarks uses a Scheme-to-JS compiler to produce code. And Emscripten, an LLVM-to-JS compiler, produces JS apps in the same way to OP did, and we measure these periodically to make sure we don't regress. But the OP's benchmark is hardly representative of real web usage, and which particular implementations did well here is at least partially down to luck.<p>So to summarize, benchmarking is hard, no-one is doing it right, I'm not even sure we know what right is, but most of us can agree that ported C apps are probably not representative of real browser usage.<p>And I leave you with a final reminder that I don't speak for Mozilla.<p>[0] This was true when my mate worked on Lua two years ago.<p>[1] If you can package Gmail and Facebook into a nice platform-independent package that we can run and get <i>one single number</i> representing its performance, we will happily use it and worship at your feet.<p>[2] Microbenchmarks (how fast is string appending, for example) aren't the answer either.<p>[3] On multiple platforms, while doing the same thing on each.<p>[4] Other posters commented that string-appending is an O(n^2) operation - this isn't quite true. The naive implementation is, but JS vendors haven't been naive since at least 2007.<p>[5] While not representative of the real web, these benchmarks helped us run our little JS performance war, right from slow-and-sad up to fast-and-awesome.",1304379037

A minimal level of end tidal CO2 concentration of expired air can indicate that exchange is in fact taking place in the lungs/pulmonary vasculature regardless of the presence of a pulse. This CO2 level has been used to predict outcome and help decide when to terminate resuscitation in such events.<p>Like pulse oximetry, capnography typically works by detecting infrared energy absorption at a specific wavelength compared to a reference energy source. One difficulty with the idea of making a cheap device that one might, for example, plug into a smart phone, is that unlike a pulse oximeter, you don't simply slip the energy source/detector over someone's fingertip - the capnographic sensor is usually adapted or otherwise attached to the endotracheal tube with which the person in extremis is intubated.",1304378115

518148,comment,516778,516778,0,0,feijai,,,"I don't know how to say this without sounding like a troll, so I'll just come out and say it: the people who have responded to your question so far sound like they know a lot about Lisp or functional programming and rather little about games.<p>You came to HackerNews, where all the functional programming boosters hang out (myself included) and asked: can I use functional languages for X?  What, were you expecting an unbiased answer?  To HackerNews, functional programming can do X optimally, forall X.<p>All languages have tradeoffs, though it sometimes seems like we have yet to face up to the tradeoffs in functional programming.  But in truth, functional programming kinda sucks for games, and the more functional it gets (that is, as it approaches Haskell), the more it sucks.  Because game logic is all about the one thing that pure functional programming disdains with all its heart: global internal state and side effects.  The purer you get the more you have to jump through hoops to manage this kind of stuff.  So IMHO you're really asking: can I learn a functional programming language by coding something which functional programming is fairly hostile?  And people here are responding: sure, you'll love it!  It's perfect for you!<p>Also note that real game programming is also often about speed and soft real-time guarantees.  Sure, games often have a high-level scripting language in which certain gameplay elements are written.  Lua, for example, is one popular choice.  Variations on Javascript are another.  But if you're looking to <i>write a game</i> in a programming language, and need to eek out that extra bit of cycles to do something nifty, most of the languages here are bad bad choices.  This is probably not something you care about since you're just looking to learn, which I applaud.  But it does tell me that boosterism is in effect when people recommend Lua and Clojure and ABCL and SISC for game programming that they've not considered, and they don't bother to tell you that these languages are quite slow, for an environment (games) where speed really matters.<p>So if you're trying to learn a functional language by doing a game, I'd pick the least hostile functional language that has highly portable graphics and event support and which is decently fast.  Ordinarily I'd say CommonLisp, but ABCL's not there yet.  One language in this category is Kawa, a JVM scheme which can be optimized to run at a decent fraction of Java.  PLT might be another choice: it's not super fast but has very strong and portable libraries.",1237211946

The colors of ripe fruit, for example, frequently contrast with the surrounding foliage, but dichromats are less able to see such contrast because they have low sensitivity to color differences in the red, yellow and green regions of the visual spectrum.

(One thing that happens is the college-age men stuff the supply of replies full of phony responses, especially if the survey is about some salacious topic such as sexual behavior.)<p>I responded to a telephone call that came to my home phone number from Gallup Poll a few weeks after the United States presidential election. Gallup attempts to proactively call all households in the United States, and to correct for households that refuse to answer its calls. The interviews are quite long, and they ask a lot of demographic questions for stratifying the data gathered. If my caller I.D. box had not said ""Gallup Poll,"" I never would have picked up my phone for a cold call. I got another poll call just this weeked, and many years ago got a call from the Harris Poll. The major polling companies attempt to actively gather random data samples, so what they do is distinguishable from voluntary response. But a magazine that writes a little sidebar ""email your response to [email address]"" is simply gathering worthless data. The same is true of TV stations that tell viewers to cell-phone text a response to some number they designate, or websites that have a poll form for anyone who surfs by.<p>If you are gathering data to improve a website, you are much better off conducting a live usability study in which you observe the user directly than simply polling visitors who voluntarily respond.",1237210620

518111,comment,516778,516778,0,0,JoelMcCracken,,,"It seems that you haven't had the ""benefits"" explained yet.<p>Writing in a functional way allows you to express algorithms more easily than you could otherwise. At any given point, while doing something functionally, you only need be concerned about the state of your inputs and your output(s). Letting go of state frees your mind from worrying about so many variables, and it allows you to think about the algorithms more easily. Of course, it may take a while to start to think about things functionally, but you'll have that any time you are learning something new.<p>Another benefit is it makes things easily concurrent, which is a large challenge for the game industry at large. Caveat -- make sure you know how your language/implementation deals with this, however. Erlang is much different than Common Lisp in this regard, for example (unless there is a specific CL language with threads that I don't know about).<p>BTW, basically every lisp you'd ever use has objects, <i>or multimethods</i> <a href=""http://clojure.org/multimethods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/multimethods</a> << basically the same thing, as far as it matters.<p>Thus, Lisp, ML, etc allow you to use FP whenever it is beneficial, and allow you to confine your state changes such that you won't have to worry about them nearly as much. Thus, many fewer bugs.<p>I cannot encourage you enough to continue to look into this. My only concern is that you will run into a lack of libraries, which clojure addresses, as everyone has already mentioned.",1237209481

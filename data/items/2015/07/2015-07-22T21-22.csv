In other words, <i>given</i> that these pro-rata investments must be all-or-nothing to avoid signaling risks, what&#x27;re the financial returns of investing in the entire body of YC startups that raise follow-up funding, regardless of whether they&#x27;re actually a good deal individually?<p>I can see how this could easily turn out in YC&#x27;s favor.  For one, the really obvious failures often flame out during YC itself and fail to raise follow-up funding, and so YC wouldn&#x27;t have any obligation there anyways.  And the really big successes become worth far more than $250M, enough to subsidize many failures.<p>The big question for me is what it does to incentive alignment - it seems like YC now has an incentive to ensure that companies it doesn&#x27;t like don&#x27;t raise follow-up funds, as well as incentives to get lower valuations on the early funding rounds.  It also in theory should make them pickier about their application process, knowing they&#x27;re committed to participating in any follow-up rounds.  On the plus side, they have an incentive to ensure that promising startups <i>do</i> raise follow-up funding (rather than go out of business), it avoids some of their misaligned incentives relative to the rest of the investment community, and they have an incentive to keep helping their investments later in life.",1437600720

9932368,comment,9931121,9931121,0,0,grellas,,,"We live in an era where major founder leverage is a fact of life in the startup world. Unlike the bubble era, founders today - or at least those that are among the most talented - have substantial power in determining the direction of their ventures and the investors who most benefit from this are those who win their favor and align their interests along with those of such founders.<p>YC is an innovative venture capital firm whose model depends heavily on its maintaining credibility with the talented founders who run the ventures it funds. In this sense, it has caught the spirit of the age brilliantly and that is why YC stands out as one of the premier investment firms of our era.<p>A key element in this approach is for YC to do what it has done all along and that is to take common stock instead of the almost sacrosanct preferred stock that VC firms have always insisted on in the past. This radical innovation in VC-style funding has set YC apart from the pack of VC firms, incubators, and any and all other manner of investor wanting to hitch their wagon to the talented founders who are capable of building successful, massively scaling ventures that seek to transform all of world commerce. Its importance cannot be emphasized enough as a key to YC&#x27;s success. It has enabled YC both to be in the midst of the fray and to stand above it, all at the same time. It is the founder&#x27;s ally even while it benefits mightily as an investor.<p>What then to do after the founding stage to avoid dilution to its initial investment stake without jeopardizing credibility with founders? If YC were to pick and choose in participating in early follow-on rounds, this would selectively help and simultaneously hurt the various founders it works with. Almost by definition, the fact of such an investment would brand some YC ventures as in and others out of YC favor, a result that would prove highly damaging to the aura of goodwill that is not only helpful but absolutely indispensable for YC to maintain with its founders.<p>So how to maintain that goodwill and still avoid subsequent dilution in the various investment rounds that inevitably follow from the inception of star-quality companies?<p>Well, you can set up some fixed rules, make such follow-on pro rata investments automatic within the defined bounds that make sense for YC, and use that as a way of extending YC&#x27;s leverage to help it keep the 7% (or whatever) stake it begins with in each venture.<p>And that is precisely what YC has done here with its pro-rata program.<p>Founders usually have no problem with early stage investors being able to participate pro rata in later rounds as long as they are significant investors and as long as such participation does not jeopardize their ability to raise later-stage money on good terms.<p>YC is of course a significant investor.<p>As to jeopardizing future funding terms, I believe YC has made a judgment call here that the investors it typically works with will have no problem taking something less than their accustomed full pieces in the later rounds to accommodate YC and will therefore continue to finance YC ventures exactly as before. Hence, no prejudice to founders and no loss of goodwill or credibility among founders.<p>I believe this is a sound calculation. YC has been able to persuade VCs to deviate from a variety of their traditional rules/requirements as part of being a part of the YC universe. This is just one more to be added to the list. It is a world of increased founder leverage and that means investors who want to stay with the deal flow need to adjust and adapt. I think they will do so here as well.<p>In a worst case for YC, this might prove a failed experiment. But the downside of the experiment&#x27;s failing is minimal while the upside in being able to avoid later-stage dilution among a vast group of potentially valuable ventures is huge. Thus, this makes eminent sense for YC for sure and probably for its founders too. As for the VCs who will have to adapt a bit, they will survive and very likely continue happily investing just as before. At least that is how I read it.",1437600037

The situation in the universe with evil Spock is of course different, but it was going to turn out that way in that universe. In between a founder could probably ask YC not to participate.

I was confused starting with &quot;attempts by certain groups to dictate to artists what they should create&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s certainly meant as a metaphor, no? While I&#x27;m certain there are people who want laws passed to enforce their beliefs, they would be a fringe group and not representative of &quot;progressives&quot;. In any case, such laws in the US would be unconstitutional, so all that&#x27;s left is the force of argument, protest, boycott, and persuasion - all of which are allowed under free speech.<p>The next reference to dictatorship is &quot;...totalitarianism, censorship, lack of freedom and a regime that dictated what people should think, write and create, I utterly abhor any attempt to reintroduce such things in the name of any kind of good intentions.&quot; This is the sort of &quot;dictate&quot; which carries the force of law, or at least institutional power, behind it.<p>I can&#x27;t figure out why the metaphorical use of &#x27;dictate&#x27; in the first paragraph connects to the literal use in the latter. Could you explain the connection?<p>We can point to places where the force of law <i>does</i> prevent artists from doing what they want to create. A classic example is the Red Cross symbol that many games, going back to at least Doom, use for health power-ups. Thing is, it&#x27;s a protected symbol under the Geneva Conventions, and US law prohibits that use ( 18 U.S. Code § 706 ):<p>> Whoever, whether a corporation, association or person, other than the American National Red Cross and its duly authorized employees and agents and the sanitary and hospital authorities of the armed forces of the United States, uses the emblem of the Greek red cross on a white ground, or any sign or insignia made or colored in imitation thereof or the words “Red Cross” or “Geneva Cross” or any combination of these words—<p>> Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.<p>More recently the ICRC has been pushing game companies to not use that symbol, which is why the recent Xbox 360 port of Doom no longer uses that symbol.<p>Here we have a case where there is a law that prevents game artists from doing what they want, and passed for humanitarian reasons (&quot;good intentions&quot;) - and reasons that I fully agree with, by the way.<p>As expected, there are many people who protest this restriction on artistic freedom, and on nostalgia. But to say it&#x27;s equivalent to an oppressive Communist dictatorship is so overblown as to be meaningless.<p>Do you think this law prohibiting the use of the Red Cross symbol is an example of an oppressive dictate that should be removed? If not, how is it that people using their free speech rights to change things they don&#x27;t like is equivalent to them wanting dictatorial power?",1437599207

I shared one occasion because the number of occurrences for my example does not matter. I could see the laughing one mattering a bit more if it occurred regularly, but that is a different example.<p>Luckily the concept of being lost was shared context for the given example and number of occurrences is irrelevant so long as they don&#x27;t come multiple times from the same individuals.<p><i>>Not only does she feel like she doesn&#x27;t belong there, she&#x27;s not even allowed to feel like she doesn&#x27;t belong there because you know better than she does about how she should feel.</i><p>Feelings don&#x27;t change reality - and yes. I believe that the world should have more positive beliefs in one another than negative beliefs in one another. People get along better when they aren&#x27;t assuming the worst in one another.<p>Imagine a scenario where a friend tells you they are too busy with work to go see a new movie with you. Depending on whether you believe them or not - your <i>feelings</i> will differ. They&#x27;ve been busy for weeks! The movie is now out of theaters entirely. Have your feelings changed? Sure. Most people would, at this point, suspect their friend of lying to them. So you feel like shit, you think your friend is avoiding you, and are sad. Other people have tried to convince you that your friend was busy, but you refused to listen to them because your feelings told you otherwise.<p>Turns out they were <i>simply busy like they claimed to be</i>. But now you&#x27;re pissy at them for &quot;avoiding you&quot; and refuse to talk to them because you&#x27;ve convinced yourself, contrary to any evidence, that they were lying to you because your <i>feelings</i> told you so.<p>They feel like they don&#x27;t belong <i>because</i> they feel like they don&#x27;t belong. Because they <i>feel like they don&#x27;t belong</i> they see other peoples&#x27; actions as <i>affirming that belief</i>. It&#x27;s a matter of perspective that they feel this way. So yes, feelings can be wrong and assuming the worst will always result in the worst being visible.<p>The world needs less negativity - not more.<p><i>>This about the assumption that the person you see before you must be lost because they don&#x27;t belong there.</i><p>Statistically true, so it&#x27;s likely a safe assumption to make that will likely <i>benefit more people than it &quot;harms&quot;</i>. The fact it is asked at all shows that it is true more often than not. The same reason why I&#x27;m not asked if I want a fork or chopsticks at a Chinese restaurant: more often than not, people request a fork.<p>Now - I could assume the Chinese restaurant is racist for giving me a fork instead of chopsticks. It&#x27;s a microaggression against me! Why assume I want a fork? I&#x27;m capable of using chopsticks!<p>But that viewpoint is pessimistic, self-centered, self-victimizing, and feeds negativity into itself. I prefer to shift my perspective: most people ask for forks, so they gave me a fork. I don&#x27;t give myself a victim-complex, I see how it benefits other people of society (less people have to ask for a fork!), and it&#x27;s a rather neutral viewpoint to hold that is <i>just as reasonable</i> and <i>probably more likely</i> than the former.<p>So to answer your question: I don&#x27;t give a shit for their feelings - because their feelings come from their pre-determined pessimistic viewpoint. They&#x27;re looking for a negative reasoning behind an action and found it. They got what they were looking for, and just like their truth-telling friend, they believe their friend to be a liar.",1437599173

It&#x27;s not unheard of, and isn&#x27;t necessarily due to staffing issues (maybe quantity of staff).<p>I count driving, showering and cooking as work.

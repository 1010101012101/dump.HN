41965,comment,41716,41901,0,0,drusenko,,,"ambition put together a pretty coherent reply as to why lots of people who went to college during or post-facebook found it pretty damn useful. now that i've graduated, yes, i do want to keep up with friends i made in college (and not just those 10 that i'll visit and keep in close touch with), so that purpose is enduring. yes, i do enjoy keeping in touch with people i've connected with, all through my life. and yes, i'll still want to have a quick, but easy way to stay in touch with more people that i could have before.<p>quite surprisingly, my mom joined facebook last week. she friended me and put up family pictures. i've had several friends from college and that i've met since message me about those pictures -- in a very real sense, it's joining my personal networks on many levels and allowing people to stay in touch with me and for me to stay in touch with them more easily.",1187020522

In my free time I wrote up this application which enables users to create topics and discuss it with their friends. <p>I would spend a lot of time on reddit but rarely participated in the discussions. This had me wondering, ""Would we be more willing to participate in a discussion if it involved people we know?"" The quest for an answer led me to create tribeIn.

41953,comment,41716,41777,0,0,snorkel,,,"As much as I enjoy scoffing at Facebook I have to admit I've personally seen not-so-net-savvy people get pulled into Facebook for its ability to reunite and keep up with far flung friends.  That it's good for.  <p>Facebook is not however a lucrative environment for 3rd party applications. All this hype about Facebook applications must stop. Please everyone, stop it. It's wasting precious development time. Have you not seen the most popular Facebook applications? Sopranos quotes, horoscopes, lucky numbers. It's like shareware hell rising up from bowels of long dead usenet groups and has manifested its unholy presence as a Facebook page. It pains me to know that some clueless VCs see a future in that. <p><i></i><i> Major spoiler alert!!!   Do not read further if you are heavily vested into Facebook development!!! </i><i></i><p>Here's the final truth: Facebook users are not willing to pay for Facebook applications.\n",1187019693

41946,comment,41709,41843,0,0,far33d,,,"For once, myname, I'm actually going to agree with you. Blogging is, on the side of techcrunch, basically the equivalent of rewriting a press release (ok ok, sometimes he does some editorializing and ""reporting"" but not usually). On the side of talkingpointsmemo, it's an ongoing ""I watch CSPAN and editorialize"". <p>In the middle is what is being lost without news organizations. I'm not saying that it can't exist, it just doesn't exist yet. To fund this kind of reporting (which takes time and people) you need a revenue model that can support it and you need that journalistic ethic - the one that tells you that losing money on something is ok because it serves the public good. This ethical stance is the one basically only left amongst major newspaper organizations (the national TV news used to have it but they forgot it years ago).<p>",1187018875

I can see how some people think this is offensive, but honestly, they lack the context of every other email he's ever sent. I think Yahoos would be more worried if he started using capitals honestly.",1224658168

Sometimes my headspace fits one class of problem better than another, other times I might want to push a largish patch early to another team member, sometimes you want to break a lot of stuff as is often the case with exploratory programming. Short lived branches can be very handy.",1224658117

I'd advise learning it as a must - it simply ""opens too many doors"" to be ignored.<p>In Russia, in the 90-s people who spoke English more or less decently were so rare in some regions that they were hired mostly for their knowledge of the language. Not sure about Turkey, though.",1224657895

It's a pain.<p>I'm sure there's a good example of TinyMCE finely-customized to fit an interface beautifuly and I'm sure someone here will produce said example, but most of the places where I see a WYSIWYG editor, it looks kind of out of place, this is very important to some designers (I think)",1224657797

339800,comment,338045,339196,0,0,raquo,,,"No, frankly, I usually see clearly that's it's an arrow only when I come rather close - before that it's just some small, green light left to the main traffic lights.<p>The thing is, I DO NOT NEED to distinguish that it's a left arrow, because nothing else can light up left to main R-Y-G traffic lights. Now imagine that you have a fourth traffic light below the R-Y-G lights, it may light up as a left arrow, or as a right arrow, in the same place. I would have trouble in that situation, distinguishing between the two arrows.<p>BTW I live in Russia and weather is poor here most of the year, and most traffic lights are made of arrays of rather big LEDs which are brighter and blurrier than older lamp-based traffic lights but make the shapes harder to distinguish. I guess in the US it's better.",1224657027

339794,comment,339540,339631,0,0,blakeweb,,,"> If you're in a creative position, talent is essential.<p>I used to believe this strongly as well.  I worked with a great web graphics designer on several projects 3-5 years ago.  We'd collaborate on overall flow and wireframes.  He'd make it look good, and I'd make it work.<p>I commented once that I wished I had his artistic talent.  His response was basically that if along the way I'd spent as long in photoshop working on and trying to dream up mockups as he had, I'd be just as good.<p>Since then I've come to strongly agree with him.",1224656802
339793,comment,339371,339750,0,0,timtrueman,,,"I think you're getting revenue and net income confused. Revenue is over $7B TTM...Net INCOME is over $1B TTM. Sure Q3 was $54M, but at least use TTM or something other than multipling by 4. That's just misleading. Also even the linked article said ""[t]he goal was to reduce annual expenses by more than $400 million before the end of the year"". Your estimate of saving $50M through layoffs is absurdly off. Even people with no faith in the layoffs ability to reduce operating costs would admit it's going to be the majority of the $400M, i.e. saving at least $200M or roughly $150k per employee (a much more realistic figure if you remember there are costs outside of salary to an employer).",1224656721

I can see why it's good for open source if you have a ton of contributers, but what's the win for a small team who hardly ever branch?",1224656631

Such a pity when the ability of charities to connect online with people has such potential.<p><i>They sponsor engineering, CS & BA students? Why not get some help from them. Maybe see about setting them up with a good, easy to pass around CMS & let their students do it. (maybe offer to supervise) Let the BA guys apply to Google, MSN, Yahoo, etc. for some advertising credits.<p></i>*on a side note, the info they did give got me curious. They peaked in 2003. Why?

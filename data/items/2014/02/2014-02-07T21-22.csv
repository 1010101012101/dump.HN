Since most of the company is cash you can&#x27;t buy shares cheaper than $1000.  But you might pay say 10x profit and thus the stock price is $1010.<p>If the company had paid out excess cash all along, the stock price would be $10 at 10x profit, and so every $10 you invest would give you a 10% return versus a 0.099% return.

7198993,comment,7197449,7198811,6,0,lutusp,,,"> Let&#x27;s phrase the question this way: if I have a 1 kg mass of plastic and metal in some proportion and I throw it out of the airlock with the initial temperature of 293 K, what will its temperature be 30 minutes later if it was (a) in the shadow and (b) in the sunlight?<p>To answer, I have to say first that radiation is a much more efficient way to transfer heat energy than convection, and in some contexts it rivals conduction. If it&#x27;s in shadow, exposed to space and not the sun, the object in your thought experiment will radiate most of its heat energy rather quickly, and will ultimately fall to a temperature near the CMB, i.e. 2.7 Kelvins.<p>> Now, the radiation heat transfer out of a black body will be: q = σ T^4 A, where q is the Watts of heat transferred, σ is the Boltzman constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and A is the surface area. Roughly: 5.6703e-8 x 293 x 0.1 for a GoPro camera. That&#x27;s 1.66e-6 Watts.<p>In your calculation, you failed to take the fourth power of the temperature.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation#Stefan.E2.80.93Boltzmann_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation#Stefan.E2....</a><p>j = σ T^4 (j = radiated power watts)<p>= 5.67 * 10^−8 * 295^4 Watts from a &quot;unit square&quot;, presumably a square meter, or about 430 watts.<p>Remember that three-dimensional objects lose their heat energy more quickly as they become smaller in size (because their dimensions decrease proportional to the square of their dimensions, but their volume declines as the cube). This means the GoPro camera, initially at room temperature, exposed to space would radiate away its heat energy very quickly.<p>The linked article suggests that a person (at body temperature and in a normal earthly environment) radiates away a net power of about 100 watts. Remember about this figure that is is a net (radiation minus absorption) for a person of about 2 square meters surface area at room temperature.<p>If we calculate the example of a person exposed to space (in shadow) directly without any heat inflow, the radiated power would be about 860 watts.<p>If a person were shaped like a GoPro camera (with the same density) and we scaled it down proportionally, the rate of heat loss would increase (even though the power would decrease) for reasons given above. That consumer camera would not be long for this world -- in fact, it would probably expire faster than the hapless human in the above example.<p>> So assuming we are in the shade and are not touching cold objects, the GoPro will come back at the exact temperature it left after a 30 minute space walk.<p>Do take the fourth power of temperature. See how that turns out. :)",1391809913

It has been tough as we have been working full time for a company and hacking like crazy once we got home, or on weekends.<p>We chose to use Heroku because of the dead simple workflow that would allow us to spend time developing features instead of maintaining the infrastructure. This may sound like a cliché, but boy was it a good decision. The platform is rock solid, deployments are a bless and the add-on system is just one of the best time savers you can get.<p>We know OpsWorks (or earlier Scalarium) from our full-time job, and we know how cool it is. But we also know that it requires a lot of time and additional effort to keep things running.<p>This may pay off if you run a company which can afford it, but you should think about it twice if you have limited resources (and other, more important things to do!).<p>Even now, after we have launched, we still see no reason why we should move from Heroku to OpsWorks (or another platform). We have made some optimizations and clever (to us) decisions to avoid running into scalability problems. Maybe we will think about migrating once we get a ton more clients and even more traffic. It is cheaper to just add some dynos than spending time on server administration.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s all about making the right decision, so don&#x27;t hurry and if you think Heroku is too expensive for your business, maybe you are not making enough revenue from your customers. On the other hand, if you have the money and time, than go for it.",1391809100

They both spoke limited English and settled down in a part of New York that is predominantly Caucasian. For many years, he worked as a dishwasher while saving up diligently.<p>When he saved up enough money, he entered into a partnership with 2 others to open up a restaurant. One of the partners screwed the other two and he had to declare bankruptcy.<p>He went back to being a dishwasher, then later a cook, as he saved up money again. Finally, he had a chance to purchase a hole-in-the-wall restaurant that he thought he could improve. Unfortunately, that one also failed. And he declared bankruptcy for a second time.<p>That still didn&#x27;t deter him. He worked again, saved up again, and opened up his third restaurant, a sushi restaurant. And for him, the third time was the charm.<p>This one became a success. It grew to 3 locations total. Every morning, he drove for hours to the fish market at 4am to select the best fish, then transported it to his restaurants in the back of his truck. He still has that truck. We all called it his &quot;fishmobile&quot; because it stunk of fish like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.<p>He didn&#x27;t reach this success until his 50s. Through it all, his wife was amazingly supportive. She worked alongside him in these restaurants too. They are retired now. He shared his story with me when I told him I was starting a business of my own.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine having to lose so much, but in his perspective, he started out with nothing, so it wasn&#x27;t that painful to return to nothing.

7198811,comment,7197449,7198580,3,0,IgorPartola,,,"I understand what you are saying about things like the Moon, Pluto, etc. If a bury a thermometer on the moon, and dig it up 5 minutes later, it will be very cold.<p>But we are talking about a space walk here. Let&#x27;s phrase the question this way: if I have a 1 kg mass of plastic and metal in some proportion and I throw it out of the airlock with the initial temperature of 293 K, what will its temperature be 30 minutes later if it was (a) in the shadow and (b) in the sunlight? This is a different case than being in contact with a hot or cold satellite or planet. It&#x27;s a rate problem. If we assume a near-perfect vacuum, the only heat going in and out is via radiation. So the question is, how fast does a hunk of metal/plastic radiate heat at 293 K.<p>Now, the radiation heat transfer out of a black body will be: q = σ T^4 A, where q is the Watts of heat transferred, σ is the Boltzman constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and A is the surface area. Roughly: 5.6703e-8 x 293 x 0.1 for a GoPro camera. That&#x27;s 1.66e-6 Watts, or 1.66 microwatts. That&#x27;s a pretty damn low transfer rate: we are talking about roughly 3 mJ of energy lost over 30 minutes.<p>Now, the delta T here is equal to Q/(mC), where Q is our 0.003 Joules, m is the mass, 0.135 kilograms, and C is the specific heat. The specific heat is tricky but let&#x27;s assume this thing is made out of copper: 390 J/(K kg). That gives us a delta T of, drum roll please, 5.7e-5 degrees. So assuming we are in the shade and are not touching cold objects, the GoPro will come back at the exact temperature it left after a 30 minute space walk.<p>We can of course figure out what it will be in the sun, where I expect it&#x27;ll heat up quite a bit, which is probably the more dangerous thing for a piece of equipment. The equations are nearly the same.",1391808070

10090321,story,,,15,21,gkjin,"Ask HN: 23 year old loss in life. What to do now?",,"Just a bit of background. I&#x27;m 23 years old this year. Graduated last year from a top university in UK with a Bachelors(Hons) Chemical Engineering. Right after I graduated, I went back to my home country Malaysia.
I always knew I wanted to start a startup. In fact, I did try to start a couple of startups -Tripadvisor-ish for students, Groupon clone and some small &#x27;projects&#x27; during the summers like trying to sell &quot;pure fruit juice&quot; during carnivals and stuff like that. None worked out. Last year when I came back, tried to start an online grocery startup but within 2 months, I just knew it wasn&#x27;t feasible unless I had some decent funding or some sort.<p>After all these &quot;attempts&quot;, I decided to stop and reflect. For the next 6 months, I literally just stayed in my room trying to come up with ideas, but none came up. As PG says &quot;The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It&#x27;s to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.&quot; Meanwhile, I read books and taught myself how to code to pass time. I even started applying to corporate jobs but was rejected for every application. One day, my friend contacted me to ask me to join his startup. I joined, but the company was in a very bad shape and it closed down within 4 months, and that was about 1 month ago. Ever since then, I’ve been trying to sell an animal feed called rumen bypass fat(dad’s idea), but no customers so far. I also tried applying to a few local startups .<p>So that’s it. I am utterly loss right now. If you asked me what I really want in life, I’d say I want to make a difference on a large scale. I’d like to start a startup that solves hard engineering/science problem. The local startup scene is still playing catch up at the moment. The hot stuffs are ecommerce, on demand startups etc... Hence, I’m not particularly excited about joining the startups in the local scene and I would like to avoid joining big corporate companies. Any advice?",1440053328

10090319,comment,10083475,10085737,0,0,erikb,,,"I can agree that they also face pressure. But on the one hand they have more options, for example putting the work onto a lower level guy, they get less bad feedback for doing bad work (e.g. nobody analysis how stressed his workers are, but the developers code gets analysed for code quality, unit test success, peer reviews).<p>The last point I put separate because I think that one might actually be just subjective. In my eyes it seems, as if they also have less work on their table, really. Example: There are a lot of things a product manager should do. For instance, he should learn to know the customer. But at least where I worked until now no product manager was asked by his manager how much time he spent with customers. So no product manager spent a single second with a customer. Also a product manager is in my eyes responsible that the user interface is translated correctly. He can pay an external office or convince some engineers to do it who have that other language in their repertoire. But when he constantly hears from the engineers that the three or four languages we can evaluate are so shitty that nobody can even closely know what the corresponding text says, then he should review his translation workflow. Never seen that either. The only situation in which a product managers needs to hussle is when the sales department that actually talks to the customer has a problem they can&#x27;t communicate directly to engineering because both worlds speak different languages. And the only reason the prod manager needs to get active is because if the stress gets out of these two departments his boss needs to do work and then his boss will be angry. So in these situations he really has a lot of stress, because it&#x27;s hard to convince engineering of some of the requests that come from sales, but sales needs some kind of results to make the customers happy. But this situation only happens in one of 5 feature or bug requests. Therefore I think the engineers have more stress. They have stress with all 5 requests, all the time. When they finish one, there are already the next three waiting. And in this one request that required prod manager intervention the final result that should be implemented is often so bad that this one is even more stress than the others.<p>To summarize, yes there is manager stress as well, but it&#x27;s not as much. And if you get 120% of the pay of another coworker or more, I think it should be okay if you even have a little more stress. Therefore people working on the corresponding lowest level seldom have tolerance for the &quot;hard life&quot; of the manager.",1440053239

You&#x27;ll be doing random access to that level of cache, but it can exchange data with the next level cache in larger contiguous blocks.<p>In this case, 256 cache lines fit in the L1 cache, so while it does look like &quot;random access&quot; to the L1, this can end up looking more like &quot;sequential access&quot; to main memory. There are addition complications, like the L1 data cache being only 8-way associative, a quite small TLB cache sitting in front of the L2 and up, etc. So in practice this ends up somewhere between random access to L1 and random access to L3, with sequential access to main memory, I think.",1440052982

The top of the funnel could just be a visitor who downloads a fact sheet about your space or just download pricing sheet from your website (mapbox does it nicely without being intrusive). And they don&#x27;t spam. That is one good way to populate top of the funnel.<p>The sandbox access is another stage in your funnel. I am assuming you would like more folks to try your sandbox, without friction or as less friction as possible without giving too much information.<p>1. You could just let them play in a generic sandbox site without even email / registration and then subtly ask them to register and reserve the site, if they would like to come back.<p>This is like Stripe. Classy and confident that your product is loved and folks will register.<p>2. You could ask only for email id and allow them to get to a separate sandbox site. They could name the site later if they like it. You know that only those who complete registration process are more likely serious users to engage later with smart follow-ups. Those who bounce off & abandon are more likely not interested in your product. This is what we do at Chargebee - our product is serious in nature (shameless plug: we do billing with REST API on top of Stripe, Braintree & other gateways with all kinds of payment methods including card) .<p>3. If you are a 2 member team and only want to focus on very few serious users, then having a card upfront for trial acts as entry barrier. This allows only serious users to get in but  with better conversions. I think you are not inclined and very few SaaS services do this. (aweber.com has a paid $1 trial as well).<p>You should definitely test one or more of these options. But to start with a simple sandbox to explore product is definitely a good way to measure engagement, see where they click & explore product. And then derive insights based on that.<p>Then you could iterate to see if having email id for registration as a filter helps bring in serious users.<p>In our case we implemented #2. In our first iteration we asked for email, site name & password and when we removed site name & pwd fields we doubled conversions for trial as well as paying customers. We are not testing how simplifying the registration / account claimed would impact conversion.<p>P.S: When I say engage smartly, I am assuming we are all talking about non-spammy, subtle but showing enough intent to earn a serious trial user&#x27;s business, like we all prefer to be treated. :)<p>Thoughts?",1440052436

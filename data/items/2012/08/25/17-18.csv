4432696,comment,4432266,4432548,2,0,stevejalim,,,"Hi wodow - thanks for your interest.<p>Someone over on the Leanpub page has asked about how UK-centric it is, so I thought I'd post pretty much my answer to that question here, because I think it's relevant:<p>""The majority of the book is relevant to going freelance wherever in the world you are. There are some sections, though (basically the money and legal ones) where, because I have first-hand experience of operating in the UK, I've framed it in UK terms. However, the principles/topics covered are still pretty relevant wherever you are in the world and will set you on a decent path to finding out about the local equivalents.<p>While it's impossible to write a book that covers legal/financial stuff relevant to the whole world in one go, I do want to add in more territory-specific detail where people ask for it. So,in a future release of the book (which you'll get for free, remember) the plan is currently to refactor the UK-specific stuff to be generalised and then 'add support' for versions of that info applicable to additional territories (most likely in an appendix, but I'll see how realistic that is when I've had more feedback about the territories people want the book to cover).<p>But, like I said, the advice in most the book is location-independent.""",1345917524

4432684,comment,4432333,4432580,15,0,georgemcbay,,,"> Many things become ""obvious"" after they have entered commercial production, but are not obvious at the time they are invented.<p>I totally disagree.  Most things are obvious to many practitioners in a field at the time they were invented and if they weren't invented by one person would be invented by another within a very short time period.  This is a natural consequence of the progression of technology and ""standing on the shoulders of giants"".  History is absolutely littered with simultanous invention of ideas by multiple people simply as a consequence of the state of knowledge when they were actively working, with things like the calculus being obvious examples.<p>Of course, there are VERY rarely inventions where the leap made was well further than average, but those are very rare and certainly not the realm of patents like ""bounce scrolling"" which is obvious once you have a highly responsive touchscreen.<p>> The car is obvious now, for instance.<p>Who ""invented"" the car? Cugnot? Anderson? Benz? Daimler? Maybach? Marcus? Selden? Duryea?<p>Basically all of the above and around the same time (at least relative to the day when the Internet didn't broadcast news instantly around the globe), because the invention of various motors small enough to be mobile made a powered transportation vehicle an obvious goal.  That doesn't mean there wasn't technical invention in everyone's different methods, but ""the car"" was <i>totally</i> obvious, just like ""bounce scrolling"" is, except ""bounce scrolling"" is a worse thing to allow to be patented because there are a very limited number of mathematical ways in which you would want to model that and so now you're basically patenting a very obvious idea plus a tiny bit of math (which shouldn't be allowed).",1345917342

In the specific patents under discussion, I hardly think competitors could not figure out how to implement multi-finger touching, or pinch-to-zoom. An idea that is easy to re-implement (or has a means of implementation obvious to industry workers) once made public simply shouldn't be protected by patent.

Placebo is powerful, but is not all-powerful. It is stronger with some people, weaker with others.<p>Discarding results just because they were not the result of a double-blind placebo-controlled test is not rational. Neither is accepting results just because the author thinks that they are double-blind placebo-controlled:<p>e.g., almost all placebos today are sugar pills; If the tested-against-material has a side effect, such as causing flushing or a dry tongue (though does not produce the wanted outcome -- which is very often the case), this is not in face a double-blind; the patient knows that they did not get a placebo, and the whole test is useless. Yet, this is the gold standard.<p>Furthermore, if you read the NEJM / BMJ / Nature / Science medical papers, you'd notice that their result are tested on (and are therefore only valid for) a small ethnic group, a small age group, etc. But then, very unscientifically, it is assumed (by others -- usually not by the authors of said paper) to apply much more widely.<p>> That is, any ""follow up"" tests after the first guess are already tainted by the fact that Seth knows what's being tested.<p>Yes, that does not make the results any less true or useful: Butter makes seth faster at arithmetics, in a consistent and statistically significant way. That may not be true for others. And may be entirely a placebo. Nevertheless, if Seth wants to be faster at arithmetics, he can do that by eating butter, regardless of the cause.

In particular, it does not name the survey, who did the survey, how many participants were involved, what the range of errors is, what the definition of ""unauthorized collaboration"" is, how the question was phrased, or which of numerous ""Center for Academic Integrity"" was involved. The most prominent according to Google seems to be the ""International Center for Academic Integrity"" at a Clemson University, but I was not able to find a reference on their site to such a study.<p>This is a good example of the problem with not properly attributing one's sources such as ""The Chronicle of Higher Education"" is doing. Readers can not evaluate the quality of claims in the article if they can not reliably locate the sources and read the parameters and constraints of referenced surveys and studies. It's very unprofessional not to properly cite sources in formal publications and articles.<p>> ""this idea that cheaters are the ""other"" from countries where they don't know any better is ridiculous""<p>In my experience (personally as an adjunct professor, and in frequent discourse with other college professors making the same observations) most students in US engineering courses for the last 25 years are nationals from various asian nations. In many other countries collaboration on homework is expected and normal and students are not taught that failure to show sources is plagiarism. Only copying answers on a test is considered cheating in much of the world. Because of this, the majority of cheating in engineering classes is done by foreign students. Much of this is unintentional because they are simply unaware and were raised in a different system. In some cases, students receive sophisticated assistance from their home country, for example Chinese students in some courses have bound Chinese language translations of class-and-professor-specific course materials, including appendices full of past course exams for a given class, with answers and explanations. Making use of any and all resources one has access to, without feeling the need to attribute or explain its provenance is considered common sense, not cheating. Explaining US standards of academic behavior at least provides those who are unaware of these standards an opportunity to adjust their behavior to conform to US (or possibly western) standards of what is considered cheating.<p><i>Cautious readers will at this point be observing with delighted skepticism and awareness of irony that - as I post anonymously using an alias - my personal history claims above are not a reliable source and barely qualify as anecdotal.</i>",1345916148

The pirates can talk about how a ripped off copy isn't really a lost sale and they wouldn't have paid anyway until they're blue in the face, but the fact is that <i>someone</i> has to pay for the games these people obviously enjoy so much. Given that one-off big purchases of games seem to have at most 5-10% efficiency in terms of people buying legal copies, the people making the games are looking for alternative models where the pirates can't just copy the whole thing, which means something where you take the money interactively or something where you never actually get most of the game data installed locally so you can't copy it. And that means in-app purchases for the little guys and things like DLC and MMOGs for the big players.<p>And they still throw in increasingly obnoxious DRM for good measure, presumably because the net win from making it more difficult or time-consuming for some people to get a pirate copy outweighs the loss of custom from people like me who would buy a good game without the junk but won't spend that kind of money on software we aren't actually going to own/control.<p>In short, if you miss paying a fair price for a finished game, blame the pirates, and blame the short-sighted executives at the big game companies who couldn't find a better way to respond to those pirates than screwing their legitimate customers.",1345915738

That seems to be a mix metaphor of a message: lets prompt people to make a more secure password (arguably not going to have much effect) but then display it in clear text.<p>To me that seems a <i>true</i> loss of security :)<p>EDIT: ignoring his point (b) because that is completely irrelevant - clear text password boxes are no more or less secure than copy/pasting the password.

Let’s\ncompare this estimate of British wind potential with current installed wind\npower worldwide.

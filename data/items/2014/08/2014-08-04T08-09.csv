8130861,comment,8130293,8130293,43,0,tomp,,,"> Why can’t we just allow polymorphic lambda-bound variables?<p>Two reasons. The first is that in general, type inference for higher-rank polymorphism is undecidable. The second is that even if it were decidable, it would be impractical - I think that if we have a program like this one:<p><pre><code>  let test(f) = (f(1), f(true))\n</code></pre>\nthe assumption that the programmer made an error is statistically much more likely than the assumption that `f` should have a polymorphic type. Another reason is that it&#x27;s not entirely clear what kind of polymorphic type to infer for `f` - should it be `forall a. a -> a` or e.g. `forall a. a -> int`?<p>> What does this have to do with different “ranks” of polymorphism?<p>Higher-rank polymorphism means that polymorphic types can appear <i>within</i> other types; in a system with support for higher-rank polymorphic types, the parameter `f` in the function `test` above could be declared with type `forall a. a -> a`, the function `test` would have a type `(forall a. a -> a) -> int * bool`. Higher-rank polymorphism is formalized using System F, and there are a few implementations of (incomplete, but decidable) type inference for it - see e.g. Daan Leijen&#x27;s research page [1] about it, or my experimental implementation [2] of one of his papers. Higher-rank types also have some limited support in OCaml and Haskell.<p>> How is let-polymorphism implemented? How do you implement it without just copying code around?<p>The &quot;standard&quot; implementation consists of two operations, <i>generalization</i> and <i>instantiation</i>. At let bindings, types are <i>generalized</i> by replacing all unbound type variables with polymorphic type variables (care must be taken not to generalize type variables that can be bound later, but that&#x27;s a secondary issue here). Every time a variable with a polymorphic type is used, its type is <i>instantiated</i>, which means that all polymorphic type variables are replaced with fresh unbound type variables.<p><pre><code>  let f = fun x -> (x, x)\n\n  print f(1), f(&quot;boo&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nIn the example above, the type inferred for `fun x -> (x, x)` is `_a -> _a * _a`, where `_a` is an unbound (but not polymorphic) type variable. At let binding, this type is transformed into `forall a. a -> a * a` by replacing `_a` with a polymorphic type variable `a` (in most ML languages, the `forall` is implicit). Then, when `f` is used in `f(1)`, its type is instantiated into `_b -> _b * _b` and `_b` is unified with the type of `1`, `int`. When `f` is used in `f(&quot;boo&quot;)`, its type is instantiated into `_c -> _c * _c`, and `_c` is unified with type of `&quot;boo&quot;`, `string`. Since `_b` and `_c` are different variables, there is no error here (if `f` had a monomorphic type, `_b` and `_c` would in fact be the same, and this example would result in an error &quot;cannot unify type int with type string&quot;).<p>> What’s the relationship between let enabling exponential function composition and the exponential time result?<p>So there is quite a bit of copying happening every time a variable with polymorphic type is used. I&#x27;ve never studied the worst-case scenarios of Hindley-Milner, but I imagine that it has to do with instantiation copying large polymorphic types around.<p>> Do implementations of Hindley-Milner actually represent types as dags and utilize structural sharing?<p>Yes; an unbound type variable is typically represented as a reference cell, which is assigned to the type the type variable is unified with. So, if we have<p><pre><code>  double : forall a. a -> a * a\n\n  double (1, 1, 1) : (int * int * int) * (int * int * int)\n</code></pre>\nthen the type of double is first instantiated, yielding `_b -> _b * _b`, and then the type of the parameter is unified with the type of the argument, `int * int * int`. At this point, the reference cell in the internal representation of `_b` is updated to point to `int * int * int`, which means that both `_b` in the result type actually point to the same representation of `int * int * int`.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fcp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fcp/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/tomprimozic/type-systems/tree/master/first_class_polymorphism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tomprimozic/type-systems/tree/master/firs...</a>",1407142183

That will be the single quickest way to increase your rates I would immagine.<p>Additionally, have you thought about branching out into other things than purely just straight dev work for clients? Is there anything stopping you from going down the path of say selling templates / code on places such as Themeforest or Codecanyon? That can turn into a nice source of recurring revenue for you potentially with minimal ongoing time investment.<p>The other obvious avenue for someone such as yourself is going through the training path.

But I&#x27;m not going to debate libertarianism (or Objectivism) vs social-democracy vs whatever else, or any economics, because that leads absolutely nowhere and each side is firmly convinced they are right, based on facts and their value system, other than to say &quot;white young men grow out of it in their 20s&quot; strikes me as a poor argument (as are all ad hominem). FWIW, I also don&#x27;t buy the &quot;check your privilege&quot; line. I&#x27;ve already put on my &quot;trade&quot;, my money where my mouth is, by moving to Singapore.<p>High civil service salaries are a demonstrated way to avoid corruption by raising its economic cost to prohibitive levels, in emerging markets, and to attract the best talent, in developed countries. You can disagree, you probably will - Thatcher was a fan, and I a fan of hers. I also belong firmly in the camp that would rather hire an exceptional developer for $600k/year than 6 average ones for $100k/year, for the same reasons (the cost of a bad hire is exponentially higher than the money spent).<p>Regarding LKY&#x27;s pragmatism, sure, that&#x27;s what he preached and wrote about. 40 years of action shows a certain alignment with perhaps Jefferson or Patrick Henry, that few politicians today have had the balls to so systematically copy. Whether he derived it himself from &quot;pragmatism&quot; or (more likely) read up on history and watched the world, drew his own conclusions and then carefully avoided ad hominems by creating his own brand of politics doesn&#x27;t matter to me - I see a 40 year track record and it is good - that PAP is systematically blocking attempts at creating a minimum wage is one more data point.<p>In fact, this track record leads me to rethink my view of government. Overwhelming global historical evidence tells you not to trust government and to keep it small. But Singapore&#x27;s story flies in the face of this.<p>Regarding the CPF case, only time will tell. It&#x27;s not something that keeps me awake at night. FWIW I think PM Lee ought to have accepted the small damages, strategically (as the blogger would then have publicly admitted not having evidence), but I understand his being more than a little annoyed at being accused of corruption, if it was unwarranted.<p>It seems to be the only evidence of impropriety brought forward, and I disagree with you that other evidence could meaningfully &quot;just disappear&quot; in the 21st century. Why did nothing surface on Wikileaks except that fairly mild assessment of the opposition? The US government has the means for &quot;forensic accounting&quot; as you call it. Why aren&#x27;t the exiled (and perfectly free and ressourceful) Singaporean opponents finding things out? One option is that the ISD is extraordinarily good, the other option is that there&#x27;s nothing to find out because well paid and competent civil servants see no point in cheating when it is more profitable to be honest in a system designed that way.<p>I do agree with you on one thing: we don&#x27;t know where or how this will end. My experience has been (although it is Western) that it is incredibly hard for second or third generation wealth to maintain the same quality of thinking that the dynasty creator had. The problem is thus whether LKY has been able to create a legacy that will outlive him and his family (in which case Singapore has great days ahead) or whether the island will finish like Venice, with its ruling class making it increasingly difficult for entrepreneurs and those not born within it, walling off the moat, enjoying a few decades of decline and toasting the fall with overtaxed Dom. Very, very few emerging markets actually emerge, statistically, and for good reasons (cf Robinson/Acemoglu, although you might disagree).",1407141124

PHPippo, which I recently released on GitHub, is a PHP preprocessor and a PHP source micro-optimizer (the only free one I know of). PHPippo will soon gain version targeting, allowing users, say, to develop on latest PHP and deploy on PHP 5.2, with PHPippo altering/stripping away incompatible code.<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7861616<p>2. a PHP anti-badbot class, which will block traffic from most scrapers, harvesters, etc., ensuring crawlers abide by your robots.txt policies, exploiting a number of culprits to discern legitimate users and crawlers from bad ones, taking action by logging, forbidding requests, or even banning originating IP(s). (IPv6 compatible).<p>3. a (multi-platform) PHP+MySQL customizable desktop activity monitor which monitors time spent within each application, possibly identifying the single files being edited, URLs visited, and automatically taking snapshots of unidentified windows. By saving data to a database, it enables tracking habits and usage patterns. I envisioned this tool for personal use; however, it could be deployed to monitor employees in a centralized manner, though this might be illegal in many countries.<p>4. (perhaps too complex) a PHP opaque data storage layer for sessions/user data on top of a database; designed to only make user data available to legitimate owners, which share them (or part) (via public/private key encryption) with authorized personnel only. Think of it as a database layer which, in case of breach, still protects your data, emails, credit card numbers, etc. from harvesting, while still allowing users to register, validate their email addresses, forget their passwords, and do whatever required with their user accounts (via a set of API).<p>So, which project(s) would you prioritize?

It&#x27;s not that we were selfish necessarily, we just didn&#x27;t understand how things work.  Then when a business would shut down we would all complain about how we had nowhere to go, but failed to consider the fact that we had utilized the place to the fullest extent without making many financial purchases.  As I recall this happened with an arcade, a couple of coffee shops, a skating rink and various other businesses.<p>Now that I&#x27;m older I do see a lot more clearly that when you find a business that you like, you should make a point to support them and help them to stick around.",1407140974

4945552,comment,4945345,4945345,12,0,the_bear,,,"This is great. I've never actually had a customer dispute a charge through Stripe, but if it happened, I wouldn't be able to challenge it before (I only charge $10 at a time, so it would have been cheaper to just accept it). This always concerned me because it left the possibility that a customer could go back and dispute the last year's worth of charges and there's nothing I could do. This happened once when I used Amazon FPS to process payments, and I was forced to just let the customer take $120 from me. I know it's not much money, but it's really discouraging when you do everything you can to be up-front about billing, (monthly payment notifications, no-question refunds, easy cancellations) and then you have to accept frivolous chargebacks which is basically admitting to the bank that you did something wrong.",1355961585

A big company don't take any risk to file a patent, it's a few thousand of dollars and a few lawyer hours, and that's chump change for them. And that's a great sum for the small guy.<p>That's why you see companies like IBM, Samsung, Microsft and Apple patenting the hell out of everything[1]. It's actually a great defense move (so, yeah, it's the inverse of risk) and sometimes take no research (just lawyers and money).<p>There are some patents that USPTO keeps rejecting from Apple, and Apple just changes the wording and try again[2] (no small guy can afford that) until they finally get the patent.

Getting really good at following fast is probably a lot cheaper than getting really good at inventing new things that turn into products.<p>Also, then you could spend a smaller fraction of money to ""acquire"" (through various means) the schematics and trade secrets and produce your own version of the next big thing. Sure, that is probably unethical, but without any semblance of protection via patents, trademarks, other IP law, it seems like that is what you would get.<p>That being said, as it gets cheaper to distribute information and turn that information into physical goods, the amount of value in the production of physical goods is going to approach the cost to manufacture those goods.

4945449,comment,4945181,4945181,230,0,dctoedt,,,"A few points to help put this in context:<p>1.  Technically, the USPTO hasn't yet ""invalidated"" the patent; it issued a first ""Office action"" in which it stated that all of the patents claims were unpatentable in view of varying combinations of prior-art references.<p>2.  Institutionally the USPTO is very much aware of the significance of reexamination for a patent in litigation.<p>3.  The Office action was signed by a ""primary"" examiner, i.e., someone who has been around the block a few times.  Another primary examiner and a supervisory primary examiner are listed as ""conferees.""  You would be right to read this as a signal that the USPTO takes these matters very seriously; the detailed written analysis (which I haven't studied) seems to bear this out.<p>4.  The primary reference cited is a patent [1] filed in November 2005 whose lead inventor was Danny Hillis --- dare I say, <i>the legendary</i> Danny Hillis [2].<p>Another main reference is a Japanese patent publication from 2000, referred to as the Nomura reference.<p>5.  In responding to the rejection, Apple can try to establish that their inventors predated Hillis's November 2005 filing date. This is referred to as ""swearing behind"" the Hillis patent's filing date [3].  But the Apple inventors' filing date is January 2007; swearing behind that far would be a real challenge. (I won't go into the details of the statute and regulation unless people are interested.)<p>Apple can't swear behind the 2000 Nomura publication because it was published more than one year before Apple's January 2007 filing date --- see 35 USC 102(b).<p>6.  Paragraph 14 on page 34 is pretty typical:  It says, in effect, ""you'd better take your best shot at contesting this  rejection <i>now</i>, Apple, because the next time around it will be a final rejection.""<p>7.  If, as seems likely, the USPTO does issue a final rejection, Apple can appeal, first to an administrative appellate body in the USPTO, and if necessary to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The Federal Circuit is required by Supreme Court precedent to be fairly deferential to the USPTO's findings in some respects, but it's not entirely clear to me how that would play out here.<p>[EDITED FOR STYLE]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US7724242"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US7724242</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Daniel_Hillis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Daniel_Hillis</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swear_back_of_a_reference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swear_back_of_a_reference</a>",1355959904

That said, the inventions which are truly revolutionary are the ones where as soon as someone describes it you think ""man, that makes perfect sense"".<p>Yes, it makes perfect sense because it's the correct solution. That doesn't make it obvious before someone came along and spelled it out, nor guarantee that someone else would have invented it earlier.<p>There are some types of inventions ""whose time has come"". These will get invented at around a particular time by virtue of the supporting technology existing. Take the brightness control of LEDs using PWM and color mixing of different LED colors to make color changing LED lighting. Philips <i>actually</i> has a patent on this, from 1999. It was an idea whose time had come, and others came up with it independently many times since and frankly probably quite a few times before. But it was inevitable. I think it was a bad patent because it was obvious even in 1999 that you could use PWM, common already, to vary power through a LED to control brightness. It was also obvious in 1999 that you could mix two different primary colors together to form a mixed color. Patents aren't supposed to be awarded by simply taking two already obvious things and adding them together (or at least so says my patent attorney, who is perhaps too ethical about what she'll let me put into an application). But besides all that, I would argue that any ""idea whose time has come"" is probably also inherently obvious to someone skilled in the art at the time of interest.<p>On the other hand, there are some ideas which are not limited by any technology; they are limited by the creativity of humans. Take for instance the liquid metal battery that my employer works on. You float a molten anode metal on a slightly denser molten salt electrolyte on a slightly denser molten cathode metal, and bam, super high energy density, super high power density, low cost, long life-time battery. <i>This</i> is, in my opinion, an actual invention. There was nothing stopping someone from coming up with it earlier... but no one did. Why? Because it was non-obvious. It's still simple, conceptually at least.<p>As far as pinching to zoom? Honestly, I think it's somewhere between these things. Just because it's intuitive doesn't mean it's obvious. It's clearly more of a jump from a zoom button to a multitouch gesture than the jump from ""LEDs can have variable brightness and different colors"" to ""LEDs can be mixed to make color changing lights"". But it's also probably an idea whose time had come, by virtue of multitouch starting to exist. But I doubt any of that had anything to do with why it was invalidated; my guess would be that it was invalidated because of sufficient prior art to render it an obvious extension of existing technology.",1355959660

Many sites do indeed restrict passwords to 8 or 10 characters, but that's horrifically broken.<p>Any not-completely-broken system has an password space so much larger than an attacker could search that it's effectively infinite. Note that even the silly system proposed here uses MD5 which accepts password longer than would even fit into available memory.<p>> If there is a salt, it means that after hashing the entire key space I only have the password for 1 user rather than all of them.<p>As described, the ""key space"" is effectively infinite, but luckily for the attacker some parts of it are far more richer to mine than others. This is where the easy-to-guess passwords lie.<p>So the attacker won't do anything as dumb as ""hashing the entire key space"". The attacker will search the most rewarding parts of the keyspace first.<p>> It means attackers must use targeted attacks and slows them down by a factor of # of users. Rather than having all my passwords in a day, an attacker gets access to one user's password per day (over the course of a million days). (Still not a good thing to happen)<p>For example, recent data breaches suggest that 50% of users will choose one of the 10,000 most-common passwords. So the attacker tries this set on all 1M of your users. That's 10,000,000,000 hash operations. A typcial rate for SHA-1 is 3.8 <i>billion</i> per second, per GPU. <a href=""http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat-lite/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat-lite/</a><p>So our expectation is that the easiest 500,000 of your 1M accounts will be cracked in the first 5.2 seconds by a single GPU attacker. And this is approximately what happened with Linkedin, ISTR 60% of the passwords were reported cracked that first day.<p>But the rate of success slows down for the attacker and the remaining passwords begin to take exponentially longer. As of today, 90% of the Linkedin database is reported to have been cracked: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/12/25-gpu-cluster-cracks-every-standard-windows-password-in-6-hours/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/12/25-gpu-cluster-crack...</a> So there are really only 65,000 hashes posing any difficulty at this point.<p>When a fast hash function is mis-used for password hashing, salt or no salt, there's not a case where ""an attacker gets access to one user's password per day"". The attacker cracks the majority of passwords in the first few seconds yet a small minority will never be cracked.<p>Salting doesn't save the database as a whole. Salting doesn't help the users with weak passwords. Salting doesn't even help the few users with very strong passwords, they wouldn't need salt in the first place. But for the users in the 60 - 90 percentile, it might buy them a few hours or days.",1355958651

For base class methods that need code to be run before or after the more-specific subclass method is called, a :before/:after method(s) is written that will be executed before the more-specific subclass ""overridden"" unqualified method is called.  The developer of the subclass doesn't have to care/know that the base class is still doing some work there.<p>Conversely, if this base :before method needs to be modified, it too can be overridden with a corresponding :before qualified method (with/or without a call back to the base :before method via call-next-method) or even totally shadowed by an :around qualified method in the subclass.<p>This seems to be the best of both worlds.

In fact, the current french system (used for hospital billing since 2004, and tested for 10 years before that) was based on the US medicare DRG approach.<p>My job is to make patients pay as much as we can legally make them pay, using any mean necessary as long as it is legal.<p>In the past, my unit was the single most profitable in the whole hospital, by large. So I tried to sell things, and failed.<p>I would like to insist on the ""incentives"" topic with a quick example: I previously developed production analysis software to find and exploit the cases where an hospital could be more efficient and thus make more money (long story short, see one of my previous posts on <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4826314"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4826314</a> for more details)<p>As I like to say, this is as good as printing money - I can say precisely what should be changed in a billing statement, why, how much it will gain, and the probability to find matching evidence in the patient file.<p>I can calculate an expected return, so that on small cases you can use unqualified personnel, while it might be worth to have a doctor study every page of the patient file for high profile cases (since, if you don't have evidence to back your billing claim, you are legally liable - it's not unusual for a large hospital to be fined sums with 6 digits if during an audit mistakes are found)<p>I tried to sell the software, with a commercial partner. In a year, we could only find a single client in the whole french public hospital system!!<p>Want to know why? The improved productivity - short term financial gains - can be used to demonstrate that the civil servants in charge were not as efficient as they should have been, or that they should hold to that level of efficiency in the future.<p>That's just like the OR example in the article - they don't want to be more efficient because basically, making more money is a liability to the top management personal career.<p>I was quite disgusted by this twisted way of seeing things. Medical credentials did not help me. Efficiency was not welcome. Improving one's profile, even at the expense of whole hospitals profitability, was.<p>I did not explore that much, but there seemed to be a demand for a service to selectively reduce profits, to maximize government subsidies in some units - something utterly disgusting for a libertarian. I didn't think I could do that, so I stopped.<p>I will try again very soon, but now I will make sure to carefully study the incentives, and do something I can morally agree with.",1355958297

I'm saying that they shouldn't be able to patent something as easy to implement as that for 17 years, or whatever the patent age is.<p>Maybe if the patent system made a bit more sense, we wouldn't be so much against all software patents. It reminds me of the argument that people shouldn't be yelling ""SOPA"" everytime a slightly dangerous law appears, because in the end the whole protest thing loses its effectiveness. In the same way Apple and others shouldn't file for a ""patent"" everytime they work for a few hours on something.

If your current employer can't pay you more, either you're not producing enough value, or the value you're producing is being inequitably shared with others in the organisation.

Both is a sign of inefficiency.<p>Chances are if you are on good terms with your boss, you can explain this to them.

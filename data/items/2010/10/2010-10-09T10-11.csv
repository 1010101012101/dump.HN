 just sit by your girlfriend, your mum or everybody you can watch in front of a computer.<p>the best is to watch them using something you created. so you get a clue of how different problems (than you think) other people have that you might think.<p>i was yesterday at a customer showing my progress. so he (a trainer for wordpress stuff) registered on the site and asked and did some (for me) weird things.<p>there´s tons of things to learn from that. :)",1286621530

No good idea how to go about it, though. Would emulations be sufficient? Or maybe attach some real phones to a server and make screenshots (scaling?)?<p>I am not even sure how many mobile browsers there are. Would one have to test on every phone, or would major versions of webkit mobile, opera mobile etc. be sufficient?",1286621289

It will always be the case that those most interested in funding a given field of research will be biased towards a specific class of results.

1774805,comment,1774803,1774803,0,0,goodlab,,,"So I just finished reading Rework. I like it very much - there is a lot of common sense here. And we all know the saying - common sense is not very common.<p>On hiring: I especially like the part about hiring. Where they suggest doing the job yourself first so you clearly understand what it is. We've hired a lot of people and took on a lot of weight/baggage - sometime to fix issues that were systemic. So instead of fixing the issue we through a body at it.<p>On Meetings: They say meetings are toxic. Of course not all meetings are toxic - but many are. I am going to try a no meetings day at work. People need time to get into a groove. Meetings interrupt that groove.<p>Ok - now that I've sung the praises here are a few reality checks. 37Signals essentially works for themselves. Of course they have customers, even raving fans of which I am one. But they do not have clients. This is a whole different type of environment, especially when you get into more complex industries like pharma marketing keeping things as simple is very difficult. We have to have policies, compliance officers, deep documentation, security audits etc. Look at basecamp for example - we can't use it. It does not comply with SOX, it does not have time sheets that roll up to functions - all requirements in our industry. Another example is simply prototyping in html as they suggest won't work. We are required to submit technical documentation.<p>Also - size makes a difference. As far as I know 37 is about 16 people. Simple is simple at that size. When your at 70 people simple is harder. You can do the job before you hire someone to the job for you. I can't be a compliance officer - I wouldn't know how.<p>All in all I love the book - and hope to run my start up with some of the same mentality. And I'm and avid user of their products. But they are not living in a prototypical situation. Of course they may be very much more profitable than some larger companies so no one can say they are wrong - just not the norm.",1286619962

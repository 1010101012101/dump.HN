We built most of our settlements on the inexpensive outskirts of existing settlements, with free roads and cheap (and secure, as the world&#x27;s greatest oil producer at the time) oil.  We saw such development as &#x27;business&#x27; & &#x27;industry&#x27; rather than &#x27;planning&#x27;, and largely consigned design elements to private developers, with the asterisk that we would pay for whatever roads and utilities they needed - including an interstate highway system that was practically a wonder of the world at the time.  Strong tax inducements on depreciation of commercial property, and ownership of a single-family home, resulted in an ever-growing sprawl.  We actually tore up most of the public transportation that existed in the early 20th century, and the economic vacuum of urban decay accelerated itself with racial tension that much of the rest of the world does not have.",1420822560

My primary screen, a 27 inch Dell something-or-another costing me €350+ a couple years ago gives an audible noise at the thinner bars.<p>My secondary screen though, a Fujitsu Siemens 19 inch thing probably eight years old by now doesn&#x27;t do a thing. However, that one broke down a couple of years ago - the condensators in that one had broken, and my dad replaced them with higher-voltage alternatives.<p>Note that monitors breaking down due to capacitor malfunction is a common issue - the manufacturers intentionally install capacitors with a too low voltage limit, which will cause the monitors to break down within 3-5 years, shortly after the required 3 years warranty. Planned / designed obsolescence, and stuff. Free business opportunity for anyone with a soldering iron: buy old &#x27;broken&#x27; TFT screens and replace the broken capacitors with ones with higher voltages.<p>(note I&#x27;m not an electronic engineer and I forgot all of my education about the subject, my phrasing may be wrong)",1420822543

It&#x27;s dealing with the humans who use the app on a day to day basis.<p>Typically getting only a small fraction of your user base to be active in the app is pretty challenging - if you can acquire them in the first place.<p>That said, having even a few hundred active users can tip the scales in terms of what is manageable, depending on what the app does and whether they&#x27;re paying money or not. Customer support can be a full-time job or worse. In the early days your users will discover every bug and problem imaginable.<p>Biggest mistake I ever made was scaling up an active user base on a free product without a revenue model. Twice I managed to hit a sweet spot in acquiring active users but because I couldn&#x27;t leverage the scale to achieve anything other than more work for myself, I burned out and it collapsed very quickly. If you make more money as you grow, you can afford to invest in delegating responsibilities or at least justify it.

your gateway is still under development.<p>And as we wind out more coax, and gateways slower than our hosts,

So anyone who wants autonomy and to be well paid is a status seeker? Sounds more to me like they&#x27;re a typical human being.<p>> You don&#x27;t even seem to consider the possibility that you&#x27;ve already managed to recruit as many competent teachers as can exist, and that you have so many incompetent ones because your demand outstrips supply.<p>I think that idea is so implausible that it&#x27;s not worth considering. You seriously think you couldn&#x27;t lure some bright creative minds who would have done an excellent job teaching by making the profession better compensated? Not just those currently on the market but the 18 year olds who are choosing their fields of study? You don&#x27;t think there have been plenty of people who have kind of wanted to be teachers, then turned on the news and decided &quot;I don&#x27;t want to put up with that&quot; and then go choose something else?<p>> They&#x27;re being rewarded commensurate with their results.<p>Wow. Way to grossly oversimplify one of the most important public policy issues of our time. You can&#x27;t ignore externalities that affect student performance and place all the blame on teachers. There are way way too many factors to try to pin blame on any one segment.<p>>Your tests and qualifications can&#x27;t weed them out because they will attempt to game any tests you present.<p>No more than any other profession considered prestigious is &quot;gamed&quot; today. You do realize teachers need to go through a degree program, background checks and professional testing per subject they teach, don&#x27;t you? And that&#x27;s today let alone if we further incentivize the profession.<p>> This is not just an ineffective strategy for a large nation-state, it&#x27;s an economically and educationally disastrous one.

8862883,comment,8862542,8862542,0,0,patio11,,,"I think you&#x27;re asking a capacity planning question.  To the extent that you&#x27;re asking a capacity planning question, for most apps in the Rails sweet spot (CRUD which takes data from users, munges it, and stores it in the database, perhaps interacting with a few external APIs and making occasional use of more advanced things like e.g. taking uploads and storing them in S3 prior to processing by queue workers), you&#x27;re going to not even notice the day that your user count hits 10k.<p>If you back out the numbers, they go something like this: eight hour work day, worst hour has 25% of the user base actively logged in (we&#x27;ll assume it is a <i>very</i> sticky app), 10 significant actions per hour implies 25k or so HTTP requests which actually hit Rails, which is less than 8 requests a second.  You can, trivially, serve that off of a VPS with ~2 GB of RAM and still have enough capacity to tolerate spikes/growth.<p>Let&#x27;s talk about the more interesting aspects of this question, which aren&#x27;t mostly about capacity planning:<p>Monitoring: Depending on what you&#x27;re doing, at some point between 0 users and 10k users, the app failing for long periods of time starts to seriously ruin peoples&#x27; days.  Principally, yours.  Depending on what you&#x27;re doing, &quot;long periods&quot; can be anything from &quot;hours&quot; in the general case to &quot;tens of minutes&quot; for reasonably mission-critical B2B SaaS used in an office to &quot;seconds&quot; for something which could e.g. disable a customer&#x27;s website if it is down (e.g. malfunctioning analytics software).<p>I run a business where 15 seconds of downtime means a suite of automated and semi-automated systems go into red alert mode and my phone starts blowing up.  I don&#x27;t do this because I love getting woken up at 4 AM in the morning, but because I hate checking my inbox at 9:30 AM in the morning and realizing that I&#x27;ve severely inconvenienced several hundred people.<p>You&#x27;re going to want to build/borrow/buy sufficient reliability for whatever problem domain it is you&#x27;re addressing.  I wouldn&#x27;t advise doing anything which requires Google-level ops skills for your first rodeo.  (There is a lot to be said for making one&#x27;s first business something like a WordPress plugin or ebook or whatnot where your site being down doesn&#x27;t inconvenience existing customers.  That way, unexpected technical issues or a SSL certificate expiring or hosting problems or what have you only cost you a fraction of a day&#x27;s sales.  Early on that is likely negligible.  When an outage can both cost you new sales/signups and <i>also</i> be an emergency for 100% of your existing customer base, you have to <i>seriously</i> up your game with regards to reliability.)<p>Customer support:<p>Again, depending on exactly what you&#x27;re doing, you will fail well in advance of your server failing on the road from 0 to 10k users.  Immature apps tend to have worse support burdens than mature apps, for all the obvious reasons, and us geeks often make choices which pessimize for the ease of doing customer support.<p>My first business produced a tolerable <i>rate</i> of support requests, particularly as I got better about eliminating the things which were causing them, but I eventually burned out on it.  I have a pretty good idea of what my second one would look like if it had 10k customers -- that would imply on the order of 500 tickets a day, 100+ of them requiring 20 minutes or more of remediation time.  This would not be sustainable as a solo founder.  (Then again, if that business had 10k customers, revenues would presumably be in the tens of millions, so I&#x27;d have some options at that point.  There are many businesses which would not be able to support a dedicated CS team on only 10k customers, like e.g. many apps businesses, so you&#x27;d have to spend <i>substantial</i> brainsweat on making sure the per-customer support burden matched your unit economics.)<p>The biggest issue: selling 10,000 accounts of a SaaS app is <i>really freaking hard</i>.",1420820924

For that reason, I think questions of actual code aptitude are best done on the  phone, as that&#x27;s the only place where you really can evaluate someone&#x27;s thought process isolated from mitigating psychological barriers that occur during face-to-face interactions.<p>The icky reality is that face-to-face impressions are pretty much determined by how you smell. I think there are two reasons for this - first, there&#x27;s the concept that people naturally want to be around winners and if you come in looking like a loser they&#x27;ll be predisposed to dislike you in ways that escape their conscious thought. To work this one, try to chalk up a win before your interview (or get laid - again, hate that it works this way).<p>The second is that as people we unconsciously recognize whether or not the candidate believes that they&#x27;re a good fit for the position. If you go in freaked out, you&#x27;re going to set off a bad feel no matter how hard you try to cover it up. The feeling a recruiter responds to in the first thirty seconds is &quot;this could work&quot;. You can&#x27;t fake this, and this is why being as good as possible at what you do really does matter. It definitely rewards intrinsic overconfidence, but the more intrinsically underconfident people are generally smarter anyways and will eventually be so much better at what they do than their peers that they&#x27;ll win in the long run. If you feel insecure in your ability to fill a position, get better at what you do and prove it to yourself by having other people evaluate your work - the feeling will go away eventually. Code review is scary for people insecure in their abilities, but it&#x27;s easily the fastest way to wipe away pathological insecurity.",1420820633

But this again was one of the things that made it possible for the Amiga to be as impressive as it was in earlier years.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem except that Commodore failed to realise early enough that 3D was coming, and that they badly needed a chunky graphics mode to stay competitive (and we got quick hacks like Akiko as stopgap measures - a custom chip in the CD32 console that in addition to the CD controller contained functionality to speed up chunky -> planar conversions to allow games to work on chunky modes internally)<p>Modern PC systems have a massive amount of specialized components, going far beyond what the Amiga ever did - if anything, the architecture of the modern PC validates a lot of the design choices made for the Amiga, by offloading far more work from the CPU (and indeed, adding far more CPUs - things like hard drives now often contain CPU cores a magnitude or more faster than the CPUs on the Amigas)",1420820537

When things break (and they will) you need to know where to look first.<p>Having 5k users also requires time to help them with support issues. Users generate a lot of bug reports, questions, and suggestions. To keep paying users happy, I offer a 1-day response time on support issues, which requires me to spend quite a bit of time sending emails.<p>Then, of course, if you want to grow the app, you need to spend time marketing it. We could talk for hours about this.<p>The list goes on and on.

For a very long time, one of my side projects with 50K users was hosted in a EC2 small instance. With that out of the way, here are a few things you will need to take care of:<p>* Security (especially passwords) - Rails should take care of most of this for you, but you should ensure that you patch vulnerabilities when they are discovered. Also, stuff like having only key-based login to your servers etc.<p>* Backups - Take regular backups of all user data. It&#x27;s also VERY important that you actually try restoring the data as well, as it&#x27;s quite possible that backups are not occurring properly.<p>* One click deployment - Use Capistrano or Fabric to automate your deployments.<p>* A good feedback/support system - this could even be email to begin with (depending on the volume you expect), but it should be accessible.<p>* Unit tests - as your app grows in complexity, you will never be able to test all the features manually. I&#x27;m not a big fan of test driven development, but really, start writing unit tests as soon as you have validated your product idea.<p>* Alerts, monitoring and handling downtime - Downtimes are inevitable. Your host or DNS could go down, you might run out of disk space, etc. Use something like Pingdom to alert you of such failures.<p>* Logging, logging, logging - I can&#x27;t stress on this enough. When things break, logging is crucial in piecing together what happened. Use log rotation to archive old logs so they don&#x27;t hog the disk space.",1420819267

6520466,comment,6519257,6519882,1,0,innino,,,"No, I don&#x27;t see your point at all. You don&#x27;t seem to have any point - just anger and empty cynicism. In fact, to me you seem to embody everything bad that I was trying to describe in my original post, so thanks for providing an excellent illustration of one of the worst styles of Hackernews participation.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but I don&#x27;t agree with you at all that smoke alarms are irrelevant or not relevant enough or whatever it is you seem to be trying to say here. I don&#x27;t spend my life working on them but I&#x27;ve installed them for student tenants, thinking I was doing a great thing and maybe preventing them from killing themselves with an unattended cooking fire, and you know what, two months later when I went around every single one, every single flat I manage, had knocked their alarms down. Every single one. I wanted to slap the stupid fucks, but then I realised that hey, most people really are kinda lazy and stupid and you will get nowhere getting angry over that fact, you have to accept that and adapt as best you can.<p>At the time I imagined something very similar to Nest - an alarm over your oven which turns it off if it detects sudden heat. An alarm which sends me, the property manager, a text if it goes off. An alarm that can distinguish too between &quot;a little smoke&quot; and &quot;a shitload of smoke and heat.&quot; I imagined that, and I talked to the local fire service, and they laughed and shrugged and said it&#x27;d be great but who&#x27;s gunna do that.<p>And now guess what, here&#x27;s a company that&#x27;s actually made and prepping to sell something even better than what I thought about. It&#x27;s a beautiful looking object, for starters. It talks to you in intelligent language - &quot;there&#x27;s carbon monoxide in the living room&quot;. It distinguishes between potentially dangerous and critically dangerous situations. It can send push notifications to your phone when something goes wrong or when batteries are about to go out. It can be silenced with an elegant hand gesture. And it gets better: it lights up a room when it sees you walking through it at night. It can turn off your furnace if CO levels rise, if its connected to Nest&#x27;s Thermostat. And it will help your Thermostat get smarter about power usage by detecting your activity.<p>And this is just a version one product. Keep in mind - the name is &quot;Protect&quot;, not &quot;Smoke Detector.&quot; What&#x27;s to stop them making v2 smarter, and maybe it can sense when people in a house become panicked and call emergency services? Maybe it detects unusual activity when burglars enter? Whatever - use your imagination - the possibilities are huge. And don&#x27;t forget, this is only the second product that Nest has produced. And already with two they&#x27;ve made them better together. This is the Internet of Things man. It&#x27;s happening, and it&#x27;s going to be massive.<p>If you&#x27;re not seeing the breakthrough yet, then I just don&#x27;t know what to say to you. What, are you angry because they made such a good product? Because they&#x27;re selling it for a fraction of what it&#x27;s worth? Because they&#x27;re smarter than any of the unimaginative companies making crappy smoke alarms we had to put up with up until today? Are you angry because it&#x27;s &quot;not enough&quot;? Because the whole world&#x27;s not going to run out and buy this one product tomorrow, and so therefore for some weird reasons we shouldn&#x27;t bothered being excited about it, because obviously it&#x27;s gunna go nowhere?<p>Get over yourself man. The world is about to explode with companies like Nest - and new products and opportunities will emerge to improve every single facet of our life. And people like you are going to look like the worst kind of assholes when the transformation becomes obvious. If the false binary choice you seem to offer is between a chorus of blind praise and your brand of negative bullshit, thanks but no thanks, I&#x27;d rather take the former.",1381316072

Since then I&#x27;ve learnt a lot more about economics and I track key economic indicators.<p>The other takeaway was the the two slides titled &quot;Survival&quot; and &quot;Survival of the Quickest&quot;.<p>The &quot;Survival&quot; slide had the following bullet points:<p>* Must-Have Product
* Established Revenue Model
* Understanding of Market Uptake
* Customer&#x27;s Abilities to Pay
* Assessment vs. Competitors
* Cash is King
* Need for Profitability<p>...which is pretty much the criteria I&#x27;m constantly assessing myself on.<p>And lastly the &quot;Survival of the Quickest&quot; side was making the point that unless a massive cut in costs was made right at the beginning of the recession your company would die in a Death Spiral.  I can&#x27;t stress how freaked out I was when I saw that Death Spiral diagram.<p>I know those slides are 5 years old but even now for my own start-up I keep those slides in the back of my mind as I pursue growth from my balance sheet and keep my burn rate as low as I can.",1381315799

This would mean higher fuel costs, possibly slightly higher cost of electric vehicles and also higher cost of public transport. There should be a clear incentive for people to move as close as possible to where they work, or to work from home. Some incentives to steer the economy in that direction could be helpful at first, for example subsidizing company housing or directly subsidizing people to move close to their job (the higher amount, the closer the family moves), offsetting high rent in places with lots of work.",1381313497

Say I want to buy a Swiss army knife from a small city - Flipkart is where I go!<p>2.) The 500 minimum order requirement is a bit of a pain. But Flipkart usually still works out cheaper. Firstly, not many things apart from books would be available for less than 500. And books on Flipkart are massively discounted. I bought a book last week for 450, with a markup of 795.

Very few people bother to collect their own cans since one can just toss the can and be sure that someone will collect it within minutes.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that the can collecting business is somewhat organized during the prime season.

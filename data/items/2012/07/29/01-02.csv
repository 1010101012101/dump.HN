Samsung has already shown that the rates they're asking of Apple are consistent with other licensees; Apple is just refusing to pay. I think this quote sums it up:<p><pre><code>    Companies who like to get patent royalties from competitors,\n    like Apple and Microsoft, and who use patents aggressively,\n    have noticed that if everyone who was in the mobile phone\n    business before they were sues them over their patents, they\n    won't be able to make a phone anyone can afford, so they want\n    to get the courts to force folks like Samsung and Motorola to\n    accept less than a penny per handset for their standards\n    patents, while still charging the regular price for their own\n    later-issued patents.\n</code></pre>\nAnd really, the purpose of FRAND patents is to encourage innovation and competition. Every class of product has basic functionality that's essential for viability, and patents on such functionality shouldn't be used to cage your competitors out of a market. So, if you really support the principle of FRAND patents, then logical consistency demands that you acknowledge Apple is violating that principle.<p>Apple's patents are on such basic and obvious product aspects that it's nearly impossible to bring a viable product to market without running afoul. Would Apple's patents be overturned on reexamination? Almost certainly, but only after a long and protracted legal battle. Meanwhile, all it takes for Apple to kneecap their competitors is one injunction delaying the launch of a flagship product, or caging them out of peak holiday shopping season (which Apple did to Samsung last year).",1343526117

I really enjoyed delivery and did pretty well for a younger person working on tips.<p>I tried working for one of those 'food taxi' companies, who provide delivery from a selection of restaurants that don't have a dedicated staff. There was a $10 charge or $15 for food from two restaurants. The restaurant staff generally didn't care about moving fast for me as a driver as it was relatively rare. And the customers weren't inclined to tip because they assumed that $10 or $15 they paid went to me, which of course it did not.<p>After these experiences, I just don't think the people that want fast food delivered would generally tip enough, or be OK with paying any delivery fee that would cover costs + profit for the fast food company.<p>That said, interested to see how this works.

4307147,comment,4306600,4306600,3,0,csense,,,"A lot of people don't get particular networks because the US recently (June 2009 [1]) switched to digital TV broadcasting.  Essentially, digital TV is a transmission protocol which more efficiently utilizes the available electromagnetic spectrum by transmitting compressed video.<p>The problem is that digital transmission doesn't gracefully degrade like analog transmission does.  If you're at the outer part of a transmitter's range, with the legacy analog signal, you might have been able to get an adequate signal with slightly fuzzy picture or static-y sound.  But receiving a digital signal is largely a binary affair; you're either in-range and receive it, or out-of-range and you don't.  *<p>Another issue is the economics; most people get their TV through cable.  So it doesn't necessarily make economic sense for stations to build new transmitters to make their post-digital range equal their pre-digital range, especially if the new dead zones are in low-population-density areas.<p>Online streaming is so technically superior to broadcast -- there's no technical reason you can't get what you want, when you want it; and the maximum number of channels we can support isn't limited by scarce electromagnetic spectrum -- that I foresee traditional broadcast TV being completely replaced within the next 10-30 years.<p>It's still new enough, however, that the social, political, and legal issues still have to be worked out.  I.e. FCC requirements to provide broadcast-equivalent service should probably apply to ISP's, but they don't.  And companies like NBC should realize it's in their best interest to make content available at reasonable prices ""ala carte"" online, but they don't.<p>It's particularly interesting to see that recently services like Hulu or Youtube are running pilot programs for producing original content.  Essentially the reason NBC et al can get away with offering customers awful service without having their lunch eaten by startups is that they by-and-large have a monopoly on content that people want to see.  But if similar content becomes available from other services at lower cost and/or on saner terms, they'll be forced to change their business or die off.  In other words, someone needs to do to NBC what iTunes did to the music industry.  There are plenty of people in this space; Hulu, Netflix, Youtube, many others.<p>Online video is still a very immature industry because only within the last 10-15 years has bandwidth and decoding horsepower sufficient for streaming video become available to most people.  Over time the free market should iron out a more efficient solution to connecting viewers, content producers and content aggregators, but many existing businesses are enormously large and entrenched, so the process will take time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_terrestrial_television#United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_terrestrial_television#...</a><p>* This isn't strictly true; you might get some artifacts in marginal situations, but these tend to be much more noticeable and much less acceptable than with analog.  The ""in-range"" and ""out-of-range"" might change over time due to weather.",1343524911

Not that you shouldn't hire a designer, but you shouldn't wait to fix it before you hire one either. Since email is all about text, if it looks unreadable that's going to be a big turn-off. Read at least the next paragraph of my post!<p>To start, I would reduce the font sizes on your header-type items somewhat. It's clear that you're using large fonts and bold to emphasize key information (which is the right idea), but a heuristic I've found is that if you're using bold, your font doesn't need to be as big, or if you're using a large size, you may not need to be bold. When you do both, it's like an assault on the eyes, which you don't need here. Doing this alone would make your app like 75% better (note: I made that number up entirely and don't know very much about your app.)<p>Next, you could tone down the reds (I would change the hard red #F00 color to the softer pink-ish color, and then reduce the pinkish color further), and exchange the black on white for something else. For your icons, you could experiment with grays (I like to start with #333 and then go up or down), so they're less overwhelming.<p>Finally, add some labels for your icons. Remember how you made your fonts smaller before? Well that applies to these labels. They should be contrasty so you can read them, but otherwise it's fine if they're subtle.<p>A couple of minor points about your website: the proper name of your competitor is Gmail, not GMail. You should add more spacing between your icons and the text (it feels crowded currently.) Also, your circle arrow jobs are getting cut off at the bottom.<p>Finally part ii: don't forget to steal from others. Obviously I don't mean blatantly stealing a design, but just check out what other sites do. To do this effectively, you have to pick a particular thing and examine it closely. So for example, if you want to figure out how to do headers, go to other sites and see what they do to give emphasis to things without being overwhelming.",1343524903

Consider its foundational point:<p><i>""Pragma measured the effect by comparing the volume in certain stocks with the time it takes to execute an order. Longer execution times typically result in poorer results, since a stock's price can swerve away from where it was when the order entered the market. Such an effect is known in the industry as a ""shortfall.""""</i><p>If you are a ""long term"" investor you don't sell stocks to capture a few pennies here and there. You buy at price $X and hold it for a while, maybe you put in a stop order [1] so that if the shares start heading for the floor you will automatically exit. You set a value you want to see for your 'gain' and you set a limit order [2] when the stock starts getting close. The limit fires and you exit the stock. Even if it keeps rising and rising.<p>The basis for the claim in the article is that some HFT house might buy your stock when it hits the limit order price, because it is predicting it will go higher and then instantly resells it for a bit more than your price. You've cashed out already (closed your position) and they skimmed a bit of cream off the top. You didn't 'lose' any money at all.<p>For those not familiar with stock trading:<p>[1] A 'stop' order tells the firm holding your stock that if the stock drops below a certain price (the stop price) to automatically sell the security. So if you buy a stock at $10/share and you don't want lose more than 20% on it you might set a stop order for $8/share.<p>[2] A limit order goes the other way, you tell the broker that if the stock ever gets to a certain price to sell your shares. So if you are looking for a 10% return on your $10/share stock you might put a limit order in for $11/share. (or $11.25 if you want the 'net proceeds' to be $11/share).",1343524544

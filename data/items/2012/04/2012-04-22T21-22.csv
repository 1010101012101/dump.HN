3876245,comment,3875103,3875670,5,0,kylebrown,,,"Its also a form of laziness when someone (whether a coder or non-coder) presupposes that some original software is the essential element of their business idea. Barry Silbert had that realization in founding SecondMarket (its in a talk of his on youtube). He was wasting a lot of time trying to get others to build him some extravagant website when somebody told him to just forget about the website, open up a spreadsheet and start making phone calls. So that's what he did and SecondMarket was born.<p>Its probably similar to the way businesses sometimes expect new software to be a magic bullet that will fix broken business practices.",1335131955

So $715 in taxes, $300 or so in insurance, a $2500 mortgage, and you can easily be spending $3500-$4k/mo (after taxes) on housing.  Using the rough rule of thumb that your salary should be 40 times your monthly housing payment, that's $160K already.<p>It isn't hard if you're an adult, with a family, or housing obligations, or kids, etc.  If you wish to restrict the universe of ceos to relatively recent college grads with no life obligations who are content to pay $1500 to share a crappy apartment, then maybe Thiel is being reasonable.",1335131826

3876229,comment,3859685,3861780,2,0,danbmil99,,,"I don't consider this a vicious attack, nor does it make them devils.  My evidence is a large amount of anecdotal observation, close up and personal, of various people I've met, and correlating their levels of success in their chosen professions with my perception of how their minds work.  I then apply some pattern matching to relate what I've seen with my own two eyes to the patterns of speech and behavior I see in public figures.  I can't prove my hypothesis but I find that it is a very good working theory, ie it has strong predictive value.<p>I think everyone is like this to some extent -- we all have some level of double-think going on in our lives.  But for some of us, that fact is deeply troubling, and we expend a lot of effort to stamp out whatever we see as hypocrisy in our own thinking and actions.  My premise is simply that that urge is pretty much mutually exclusive with regard to certain levels of achievement in various walks of life, including (at a minimum) politics and business.  Art and entertainment are a bit trickier, because to some degree they demand a level of sincerity to be successful -- though there are plenty of obvious cases of hypocrisy there as well.<p>[edit: two examples of politicians who do not work this way are Ralph Nader and Ron Paul.  These are clearly people who walk and talk their ideals without regard to more pragmatic political calculations.  Compare their level of success with, say, Mitt Romney, who in my opinion is willing to send any neural impulses to his body that he thinks increase his chances of being President some day.  I just don't believe in our political environment, there is any possible way to get to the top if you are a pure idealist.]",1335131745

Apple/Big Six case (or Big Five, I guess, since Random House wasnt involved in the alleged collusion). Ive got my own opinion on the merits of the case, of course, but Im not going to discuss that in this post. Instead, Im going to address some common misconceptions: first, that publishers find it difficult or impossible to get their books on the Kindle without paying Amazon (as expressed by Bruce in the comment thread on this post by John Scalzi) and second, that setting up your own ebook publishing workflow requires scads of time and money (as expressed by Charlie Stross here). Now, Charlie Stross is a smart, technically sophisticated guy, but hes way off base when he claims (in the comments) that if I had to run my own self-publishing op Id lose half my writing time.<p>Starting at 5:39 PM CST, I created a cover image, formatted and compiled an ebook using Abulafia (shameless plug, deal with it), created a video explaining how to set up your Kindle to receive third-party books by email, and wrote a rudimentary book-to-Kindle distribution mechanism (actually, there was very little original code involved  all it really has to do is send the book file as an email attachment, and people have already written that code plenty of times). If you want to try it, watch the video, then set up your Kindle to allow mail from books@contraterrene.com.<p>In a (probably vain) attempt to forestall nitpicking:<p>No, I didnt write the book in that time. Its actually just a short story; Poes Masque of the Red Death  but I could just as easily have copied and pasted his complete works. The writing time is irrelevant to this discussion anyway (youll have to write the book no matter how its distributed, yes?).
The cover image could use some work, certainly. Its a modification of an illustration by Aubrey Beardsley, taken from a 19th century edition of the piece (it may be moderately NSFW, depending on where you W). If I were going to put this up for sale, Id either spend more time on the cover or hire an artist. Maybe one of these folks.
It wouldnt take much volume to bring this little server to its knees. A production server farm for the likes of the Big Six would need to be much more robust, no question about it (and Id definitely spend more than 15 minutes on the code  ). But, you know, you can spin up as many servers as you want nowadays  within minutes. Hundreds of servers. Thousands of servers. If you dont want to screw around with maintaining your own, there are companies (including Amazon itself) that will rent you as many commodity servers as you want, by the hour.
I dont have a payment mechanism set up but thats also a solved problem. These guys, or these guys, or even these guys (if you must). Hundreds of others.
Yes, Amazon could shut down the Kindles email facilities (or start blocking email from competitors they dont like), but that would very likely result in the DOJ descending on them. If that happens, getting a third-party book on the Kindle would require the awesomely complex process of plugging it in to your computer, waiting for it to show up as a USB drive, then copying the files (or you could use this  another shameless plug).
It is now 11:08 PM, and I spent 25 minutes of that time talking to my aunt Joyce on the phone about issues unrelated to this project  so about 5 hours total to go from raw text to an ebook thats available to every Kindle owner on the planet at the click of a button. Not bad.<p>Remember, thats the total time to format the book, create the cover image, compile the book, set up the server for distribution, create the tutorial video, and write this blog post.<p>And Im just, like, a guy, you know. If I can do this why cant the Big Six do the same? Claiming that theyre unable to compete with Amazon is sheer unadulterated nonsense. Sorry, it just is.<p>I should note here that forward-thinking publishers such as Baen and Pragmatic Programmers have been doing exactly this for quite some time. I didnt invent this process. I have probably a couple of dozen books from those publishers on my Kindles right now  none of which were purchased through Amazon.<p>Update: April 22, 2012<p>In case its not perfectly clear: Im not planning to go into competition with Amazon myself (certainly not with this server)  this is just an illustration of how easy it would be. If I can do this in 5 hours, imagine what someone with Rupert Murdochs budget could do.<p>The story choice was not a coincidence. The publishing industry is behaving in much the same way as the characters in the story.<p>This only addresses ebooks. Amazon, of course, also has a colossal (and massively efficient) infrastructure for delivering physical goods. Now that is an area where it would be very hard to compete with them. Digital goods are another story entirely.<p>With respect to Amazon not paying taxes: Amazon charges sales tax and pays their own taxes in every state where they have a physical presence, and doesnt in states where they dont, just like every other mail-order company since, well, always. The same is true of every other retailer from Apple and Barnes & Noble all the way down to the indie bookstore on the corner, which doesnt collect sales tax on mail orders to other states. This is one of the consequences of a federal form of government. In general, youre not obliged to abide by the laws of a state unless youre physically present in that state. Changing that would likely require a constitutional amendment. If you think thats a good idea, it might be worth considering how youd feel about being required to abide by all the laws of (insert least-favorite state). That doesnt sound quite as appealing, does it?",1335129592

Similarly, to them, we may appear as these strange shore-bound small amphibious quadrupeds who carry various strange amulets on their bodies with which they do various strange things, all of them being of completely no use or interest to an average cetacean.

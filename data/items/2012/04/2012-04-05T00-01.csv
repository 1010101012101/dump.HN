UNIX-based servers have always had a huge market share, and since servers are presumably a more desirable target of infection and cracking than home computers are, we would have seen traditional viruses hit UNIX machines a long time ago if it were realistically doable.  Also, before Mac OS X became as popular as it is now, there were lots of Windows users who hated Apple fanboys and would have loved to write a wide-spread virus that targeted Mac OS X if possible.  But it seems like Windows, especially pre-NT and pre-Vista and pre-7, but even now, has a unique vulnerability to traditional viruses.  Obviously, Mac OS X can still get hit by trojans if people use intelligent social engineering, but I feel it's still not too much of a semantic exaggeration to say ""Macs don't get viruses.""",1333587560

Saying it is means you dont understand. Thats what makes me most angry: that people dont fucking listen to people in the LGBT community or seem to understand the reason why we are angry.<p>And, no, you dont get to tell me to calm down or that I need to tolerate people who are oppressing people in my situation. No, sorry, thats worse than supporting Prop 8. Homophobia? Sure. Whatever. That sucks and makes you stupid and disappointing. Telling me that I have to keep my trap shut about oppression because the oppressors are actually the oppressed thats just grade A bullshit.<p>This isnt Fox News with all that there are two sides and the truth is somewhere in the middle crap.<p>Brendan Eichs actions are homophobic and disappointing.<p>[...]<p>Lack of equal rights does material harm to gay people. People are not able to live with their partners due to shitty immigration laws or access health services. Lack of equality in law permits every minor-league bigot from the schoolroom to the boardroom the feeling they have a right to tease and torment. <i></i>When the suicides stop and the violence stops, maybe well talk about how the homophobes are the victims too.<i></i> Until then, in order to seem fair and balanced and above-the-fray, people miss the whole reason why this is an issue.",1333587496

3800715,comment,3798763,3800466,11,0,stickfigure,,,"The point of using a CDN (in this case) is not to reduce latency.  The problem is that it becomes exponentially more expensive to serve high data rates out of a single data center.  Basic infrastructure like switches and loadbalancers start to get crazy expensive, as do their support contracts.  Also, it requires a lot of fairly rare (and highly-paid) expertise to set it up.<p>Distributed CDNs are like the RAID of content serving.  Each node can be simpler, cheaper.<p>Another bonus of using CDNs is that you're in a great negotiating position.  If you're serving 80% of traffic through one and 20% through another, you can flip it around the moment one offers to shave a percent or two off the price.  I've had people in the sales department of the formerly-80% side notice the traffic drop and suddenly call up with counteroffers.

What airport? Depending on a bunch of factors (noise abatement procedures, prevailing winds, approach tracks, fleet mix, etc) it's entirely possible it might not be loud where you are, vs another location. It's also possible that you're less sensitive to the noise because that you are working rather than trying to sleep (and also due to possible sound insulation measures as indicated).<p><i>Second anecdote, there was an airport downtown on the water [..] So on the launch day, before the sun rose,</i><p>Key word being ""water""and ""before the sun rose"" - depending on temperature gradients (which tend to occur near sunrise and sunset) and wind direction sound propagation over water can have very unusual effects. In particular, if air temperatures high up in the atmosphere are cooler than air temperatures just above the water, sound waves can ""bend"" upwards to that folks on the ground will experience lower SPL's compared to what they might hear when  the air temperature is more homogeneous.",1333584833

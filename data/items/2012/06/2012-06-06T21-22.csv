You don't have to do most things yourself - eg to include Dropbox/Facebook/Twitter/Google or your own account system you can use the AccountManager instead of building your own credentials user interface (the sign of an iOS ported app).<p>If your app will be talking to a server, along the lines of providing a user interface to view data and make changes, with the underlying data flowing over REST or something similar then watch this talk which talks about best practises.  It is especially a good idea to remember that mobile platforms can arbitrarily kill applications at any time for any reason, and the same can happen to the network.  Consequently you need to record what is going on in a local database to be resilient.

I wonder how they deal with transient failures (which would be more like 2 - 3 month). If they do the 'triple replica' thing they only get 36T effective per box, but I suppose at about 2G / movie in MPG2 thats still about 18,000 movies 'online' as it were.

This system uses a mobile adsorber, which is regenerated out of the refrigeration cycle and no condenser is applied, because the solar regeneration is made in the ambient air For the regeneration, a SK14 solar cooker is considered. The cold chamber, with a capacity of 44 liters, is aimed for food and vaccine conservation. The objective is to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the eventual use of this refrigerator in rural regions of Peru, where no electricity is available. On the bases of the results obtained, a new prototype of refrigerator for rural regions is designed, based on the same thermodynamic cycle, but including changes in design and operation.<p><a href=""http://fc.uni.edu.pe/mhorn/ISES2003%20(solar%20refrigeration).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fc.uni.edu.pe/mhorn/ISES2003%20(solar%20refrigeration...</a><p>During the day, solar energy is used to drive water out of the zeolite.

The one thing a salt does give you is that you can't crack a single passwd and then check for all other entries with the same hash = users with the same passwd.<p>But if you use a weak hashing function (sha-1 isn't state of the art) it may be that collisions, with different shorter keys producing the same output, are more likely than you would expect from the number of bits.",1339017593

As well, we did not ask subjects about their long-term caffeine/coffee intake habits, although it is likely that subjects with high plasma caffeine levels are habitual/moderate coffee drinkers. Additionally, complete data on ApoE status, education level, ethnicity, dietary habits, and lifestyle choices were not available for all study participants, so none of these can presently be eliminated as contributory to the results observed. Finally, the follow-up time of 24 years was relatively short for establishing causality and reverse causation (i.e., subjects with poorer cognitive performance may have reduced caffeine/coffee intake) is

4076216,story,,,1,0,sjalexandre,"Ask HN: Beta launch of DIY Mobile Website service. Looking for feedback.",,"Hi,<p>We just launched the beta of our DIY mobile website development tool.  The service is called Jinnsite and the beta can be accessed at the following URL:<p><pre><code>   http://jinnsite.com/signup?beta
</code></pre>
(After you sign up, the tool can be accessed by logging in at http://jinnsite.com/login or directly at http://sitebuilder.jinnsite.com)<p>The service was designed primarily for individuals (business owners) looking to create mobile-optimized websites by allowing them to create pre-defined pages (About Us, Contact Us, Photos, Videos, etc.) that they can then customize.  The service is completely self-hosted so a mobile website can be up and running in minutes.  (The user creates a unique site name for the site which is then available at http://<site-name>.jinnsite.net)<p>While the tool is designed to be easy enough for the novice to use, it also has advanced features to make it powerful enough to be useful to both designers and developers.  Some of the advanced features include the ability to include both site-wide and page-level css and javascript, custom headers and footers, domain aliasing, website redirection, etc.<p>From a tech perspective, the service was built using GWT/SmartGWT so it's 100% AJAX-based and should run on most modern browsers.<p>I would greatly appreciate feedback regarding any of the following aspects of the service:
  - the aesthetics of the tool 
  - user-friendliness / how intuitive it is to use and navigate
  - the generated mobile-optimized output
  - essential missing features
  - nice to haves
  - your judgement of the usefulness of the service to business owners, web designers, developers, etc.<p>Thank you!<p>Some additional notes regarding the beta:<p><pre><code>  - Jinnsite was developed with Google Chrome as the primary browser.  It should work on the latest versions of Safari, Firefox and IE, however these aren't as well tested.

  - On Firefox, there is a known issue of the FileManager and/or the Preview emulator will not appear full size.  A fix is being worked on.

  - The FileManager currently allows only one file to be uploaded at a time. An update to allow multiple uploads is being worked on.

  - The beta is currently limited only to 2 sites.

  - There's very little documentation so far, but when prompted for information, hovering over a field will generally provide a hint.

  - The emulator has 2 modes: Live and Preview.  It's set to Preview by default which will show every page created whether it's published or not.  Live mode is what the public sees and only shows published pages.</code></pre>",1339016638

The optimum outcome might be achieved if Netflix hands over the appliance and the ISP installs and keeps it running at no cost to either party, except for maintenance costs (hardware replacement, etc.) which Netflix bears. Both parties save.<p>If Netflix wanted to get clever, they could calculate the cost an ISP would likely pay for the bandwidth their users consume, and charge the ISP say 40% of this amount to host the appliance. Netflix saves 100% of its third party CDN bandwidth costs for that ISP and the ISP saves 60% of their peering bandwidth costs.<p>If the ISP wanted to get clever, they could calculate the bandwidth that Netflix is paying a third party CDN for the traffic consumed, and offer to host the appliance for 40% of this amount. The ISP saves 100% of its peering bandwidth costs for Netflix traffic and Netflix saves 60% of their CDN cost.<p>What's likely to happen is a bit of cat and mouse over the costs. The ISP peering is likely a lot cheaper than Netflix's CDN costs, so this could work out as:<p><pre><code>    Netflix CDN cost
  - ISP peering cost
    ----------------
  = Cost to Netflix

8990622,comment,8988984,8989669,0,0,joezydeco,,,"Remember that McDonald&#x27;s was just as disruptive in the 1960s when they introduced the quick-service model (what we call fast food today), replacing the drive-in and diner.  By standardizing ingredients, cooking methods, presentation, menu, etc, the company was able to keep the product consistent across an entire nation.  That was revolutionary in itself.<p>But choices were simple in 1952.  McDonald&#x27;s original menu had, what, 4 items on it?  Burger, cheeseburger, fries, drink.  People didn&#x27;t want customization so it was easy to assemble an order in a bag in under 30 seconds.<p>People want more choices now.  It&#x27;s why McDonald&#x27;s is struggling to keep up.  Their systems, multiple generations more advanced than before, can handle it but only to a certain degree.<p>Chipotle has found a way to address this desire for choice by bringing back what really is a buffet line.  The innovation is that they found a way to streamline that into a fixed set of choices (Burrito or Bowl?  Meat or chicken?) that avoids the line turning into a slow moving nightmare of indecisive lookers like you get at a typical wedding reception or church dinner.<p>It was interesting to read in the article how McD&#x27;s wanted to solve Chipotle&#x27;s problems with technology, when really those weren&#x27;t huge problems at all.  It shows the difference in culture.",1422975538

8990617,comment,8989714,8990488,0,0,murbard2,,,"Slavery is a legal or economic system under which people are treated as property. It has nothing to do with wages. Slaves under ancient Rome could earned wages and sometimes bought themselves out of slavery. In the U.S. for a variety of reasons, including no doubt racism, slaves were treated far worse.<p>The argument you&#x27;re making &quot;wage-slavery&quot; is an old one. What is the difference between a slave and someone who earns so little and has so few employment options that he is completely dependent upon his employer?<p>Or, phrased another way, what good are negative rights, when pragmatically, only what you can do really matters.<p>Well, pragmatically, empirically, there is a tremendous difference. People allowed the freedom to chose their employment, even at very low wages, systemically tend to rise out of poverty and enjoy better lives. Look at the history of Taiwan for instance. In contrast, systems built on the philosophical underpinnings you defend have plunged people into misery and starvation.",1422975505

I mention this because one of the phrases I heard long ago was, I guess, a selfish perspective about globalisation: &quot;It&#x27;s not about bringing the rest of the world up, it&#x27;s about bringing down our wages and standard of living here in the USA.&quot;<p>Frankly, as I&#x27;ve grown up and worked in several industries, one of which was at a Wall Street firm, I see that outlook to still be valid. In the USA, productivity is at its highest levels. Wages have stagnated. The tax system has been calibrated to serve those with the most to protect and it chokes capitalistic market forces because hoarding and paying 15% on carried interest is not a practical or sustainable model to have a diverse society of low-middle-top class members. Statistics show that the largest population of jobs in the US following the 2008 recession have gone to workers age 55 and over. They have no savings, they have to work, and because they work, they take up low-level jobs young people could occupy to get started becoming earners and taxpayers. <i>Could</i> but right now, to me, <i>can&#x27;t</i> even if they wanted that leg up.<p>Many people in the US can afford large TVs, advanced mobile phones, or &quot;buy&quot; a car on a 60 month loan plan; however, many of these items are built in places where wages are extremely low and quality of life is, well, not something I&#x27;d really wish on anybody. My quality of life is amazing by comparison, and yet I can see how hard it has been for me to achieve upward mobility in the current and foreseeable market conditions.<p>To put it another frame, the internet and poor regulation allows numerous firms in China to make IP infringing &quot;Chibson Guitars&quot; - they are, frankly, not very good but allow the buyer to <i>feel</i> special. There is an emotional and economic dynamic that is hard to quantify, but is definitely present. Should every guitarist be able to afford a genuine Gibson? I&#x27;m not sure. Should economic sniping, exploiting developing nations for simple economic benefit, and disrespect of natural preservation be tolerated? I certainly don&#x27;t think so.<p>These are just counter-points to contextualize the phrase I heard long ago, and one I think has played out with eerie prescience.",1422975504

They may adjust the packaging too (pods versus powder versus liquid) but fundamentally, it&#x27;s the same product. I would expect similar segmentation to happen in the car-on-demand market: one company will specialize in cargo, another in short-distance trips, another in trips to the airport, etc. There will likely be very little difference between these services other than branding/positioning.",1422975089

There&#x27;s no way to access anything outside the very delimited scope of &quot;buffer&quot; memory area, like stack variables or any other part of the program.<p>What&#x27;s the point of using a high-level language for re-defining basic low-level operations on buffers and recreating everything using those low-level constructs without the proper boundary checks?<p>Of course, you can simply define a huge &quot;unsafe&quot; block and program everything inside it, but what&#x27;s the point? That you have a language powerful enough to shoot yourself?<p>Compare that to C or C++: the unsafe block is always on. Any code block can have unsafe properties anywhere. Not only that, but you have ZERO guarantees on memory safety and other general operations.

If I let you analyze a Honda engine and come up with a model for it, if the engine never revved above I think 3000rpm you&#x27;d make a great model and have really high confidence that it was highly predictive.  Then when revved to 6k and the engine diverged from the model you&#x27;d flip out and not understand what&#x27;s going on until I told you that the engine has two different camshaft profiles and it can change between them.  To you, who has only ever known that an engine has one camshaft profile and that it&#x27;s fixed, this is madness!<p>I hope this analogy makes it clear that I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a big conspiracy but rather than a lot of people who are very earnest and very well meaning can get the wrong result through systematic problems that aren&#x27;t immediately apparent.<p>I also think that some of those people might in their head say &quot;look even if this isn&#x27;t true, the risk that it COULD be true is so great -- I mean it&#x27;s the whole planet! -- that we need to solve this problem anyhow&quot; and then go ahead with that.

The problem is that there is in fact a downside, a huge burden on everyone on the planet because we don&#x27;t yet have cheap, reliable alternative energy sources.

When I graduated from architecture school in 2001, I wanted some international experience, so I moved to India. What I saw there utterly transformed my preconceptions of sweatshops -- because I saw it <i>before</i> the sweatshops began opening.<p>One of the projects I was helping to design was a &quot;science city&quot; tech campus. The workers lived in an encampment next to the construction site. They worked from dawn until dusk for 6.5 days per week -- half a day off on Sunday -- every day of the month except for the new moon. Children as young as 6 were working -- moving and sorting materials, but quite dangerous inasmuch as it was on a live construction site. The standard wage was roughly $3 per <i>MONTH</i> (although food and very nominal shelter -- really more like &quot;camping space&quot; -- were provided for free). These were not outrageously abusive labour practices -- they were absolutely bog-standard practice of local industry, preferable to many of the alternatives for these people.<p>Seeing this situation with my own eyes, I realised that if these people had the option to work in one of those $1/day sweatshops I&#x27;d heard anti-globalisation activists go on about -- in line with my own sympathies -- it would be an absolute DREAM. Since then, I&#x27;ve been rabidly pro-globalisation. These days, I get incensed when I see people going on about the horrors of globalisation, with absolutely ZERO understanding of the counter-factual. Utter ignorance of how bad it would be otherwise.<p>The one case where I&#x27;ll allow that sweatshops are problematic is when their owners become so powerful that they corrupt the local politics and take steps to ensure that that the population cannot develop its economy any further. This has happened in some places, creating locked-in populations for whom the sweatshop is not the bottom rung of the ladder, but the top. That&#x27;s an actual problem, where it has happened -- but in most of the world (eg. India, China, most of the rest of East Asia), that&#x27;s NOT the story that&#x27;s played out, and sweatshops have been a vital (but temporary) step in economic development.",1422973543

I assume perfectly handling it will mean those who do live on this welfare system have their basic needs met, is that the case in the current economy?",1422972194

But new technology has been fixing that, albeit slowly, via increasingly expansive and competitive 4G, Satellite, and even improvements in moving data across copper wires or existing phone lines (not going to get you 100mb service, but quite plausibly &quot;good enough&quot; that you can realistically threaten Comcast with quitting service.)<p>I don&#x27;t want to get in a libertarian vs flame war, but the fact is, it is far easier to regulate than deregulate when it becomes unnecessary.  If the non-competitive market we have now is an artifact of old technology and installation costs, it would be a mistake to set up a regulatory infastructure we won&#x27;t be able to roll back.",1422972169

I never argued that there&#x27;s no basis for dissatisfaction but that the argument &quot;Atom is slow&quot; is often tossed around like some ultimate argument. Often without calling out what is slow (I even pointed out some of Atom&#x27;s slower operations).",1422972160

No delete panel but when you go back in time to the left and click a different link, everything that had been to the right of the &quot;clicked panel&quot; disappears. So, you have to sometimes use your browser&#x27;s &quot;open in new tab&quot; functionality to remember a context for later use - this goes against the one page web app concept, but makes it workable for me.

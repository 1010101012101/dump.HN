In a terrestrial environment, these pens are easily outperformed by many, many other pens. The high viscosity ink is under pressure, so it is <i>always</i> being expressed. Any imperfection in the ball that finds itself at the edge of the ball-barrel interface will leave you, in a matter of hours, and sometimes while writing, with a big ball of black goo on the ball, sometimes on your fingers, frequently on the paper.<p>They tend to gunk up and frequently blow out.<p>If you are going to space, get a few before you go. Otherwise, I highly recommend the Pilot G-2, specifically the 0.7 mm Navy-Blue (available in dozens when ordering directly from Pilot).<p>The G-7 is ubiquitous and writes fast. It&#x27;s not ideal for all surfaces, but 99.9% of the time, it&#x27;s the best answer.",1381445953

6530548,comment,6524257,6525448,1,0,phaedrus,,,"It sounds like you&#x27;re saying &quot;Electric motors are less dependent on gearing because torque goes up as shaft RPM drops, so you still get 700W of usable power at the output shaft regardless.&quot;<p>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying, you&#x27;re making several false assumptions and your statement is incorrect (because electric motors <i>DO</i> have a medium high RPM range where they are much more efficient than when near stall).  Although it is true that (<i>for some but not all types</i>) of motors the stall torque is very high, that uptick in torque does not and cannot rise high/fast enough to balance the loss of work output caused by choosing a gearing that results in a slow motor shaft RPM.  Recall that work is force over distance.  A completely stalled motor is <i>doing no work</i> yet consuming prodigious amounts of power (which all goes to waste heat).  In order to produce &quot;700W of mechanical power into the gear train&quot;, a motor in a stall or very near stall would have to produce infinite torque, which is clearly impossible.  Furthermore even if you consider, not a stalled motor shaft, but one turning below optimal RPM, you don&#x27;t always get twice the torque when you halve the speed, you get maybe a fraction of that.  So there&#x27;s still a power/efficiency curve.  Finally, a motor that is turning at an RPM significantly slower than its optimal rate is usually drawing much more power than it will for the same input voltage if running at higher RPM, so looking just at motor RPM vs torque at the shaft as a measure of output power ignores the important fact that you&#x27;re putting a lot more electrical energy into the motor to get that output.<p>The only way in which your comment makes any sense would be to talk only about torque and say that for most types of motors, if the motor has enough torque to turn the drivetrain at operating RPM then it will almost certain have enough torque to <i>start</i> the drivetrain from a dead stop.  So the motor doesn&#x27;t necessarily need <i>changeable</i> gear ratios in order to get going <i>if</i> you ignore or amortize the energy wasted getting up to most efficient operating speed.",1381445922

He&#x27;s fine with Google News, and he&#x27;s fine with a truncated RSS feed being consumed in News360, or Flipboard or wherever as long as the main story has to be read on talkingpointsmemo.com.<p>This makes sense to me, and I think it&#x27;s a very common problem across all content creators except the top-tier publishers who can actually make ad deals to sell inventory inside the aggregator (see TechCrunch/AOL&#x27;s experience described here - <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/23/flipboards-mike-mccue-confirms-50m-raise-says-windows-8-app-more-international-versions-coming-by-end-of-year/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/23/flipboards-mike-mccue-confi...</a>). But looking at the mobile version of any article on talkingpointsmemo.com I have to question how effectively they&#x27;re monetizing that traffic right now - it seems like it&#x27;s all a bunch of network banner ads that I can&#x27;t imagine anyone ever tapping on except by accident.<p>I think with the right native mobile experience, TPM can get a much larger value from a mobile reader, and if someone can provide an aggregator that delivers that to everyone, not just the top brands, it should be a no-brainer to jump on board. And I think we as an industry are pretty close to figuring out how this can work (we @News360 are certainly working very hard on this specific problem).",1381445819

No one is saying criticism is bad; obviously if anyone had a default position of never expressing criticism or disagreement, nothing would ever improve, right? But there is absolutely a personality type that thrives on thinking of one&#x27;s self as being smarter than everyone else, and constantly trying to prove that via relentless negativity or contrarianism. If you rely on such people for insight, you will generally end up being less informed than if you hadn&#x27;t listened to them at all, because their views are based on boosting their own ego by trying to appear smarter than everyone else rather than from an intellectually honest attempt to get at the truth.<p>At least, that&#x27;s how I interpreted the comment you were responding to. Maybe you&#x27;ve never met people like that; if so, you&#x27;re lucky.<p>The one good quality such people might have is as a continual Devil&#x27;s Advocate, in the sense that by disagreeing with all conventional wisdom they might make you take a second look at your own beliefs. But I really feel like it&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s responsibility to be their own Devil&#x27;s Advocate; relying on other people to fill that role isn&#x27;t constructive.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m really getting at is that there&#x27;s no shortage of negativity or contrariness out there, and contrariness without insight is no better than agreement without insight. In fact, it can easily lead you astray if you&#x27;re not careful.",1381445731

They actively improve things, tend to be easy to deal with, actually fix bugs you report (although not immediately, but it does happen), and I have an account manager who actually gets things done when I need stuff done. Even before I was large enough to warrant a personalized person (I currently do like 6-7 million a year via PayPal), I always found talking to their customer support simple. Frankly, I think most of the issues dealing with them are because people don&#x27;t understand the payment processing business much and end up using PayPal&#x27;s service for things that you shouldn&#x27;t (preorders being a big one, which includes small conferences) and then freak out rather than attempting to work something out with PayPal (like, I got my account locked once: somehow I got it fixed in a couple hours).",1381445640

PN repeatedly addressed the issues, each time releasing another &quot;corrected&quot; supplementary data set.

I think that to have a successful news product, you have to provide both. If you look at the classic periodic news/opinion model, the magazine, you had a strong marriage of both aspects of the overall product. The confounding issue for content providers right now is that they all give the milk away for free, and so it&#x27;s trivial for aggregaters to both focus on user experience AND have more quality content than any particular content provider. But if there was a shift in the content industry away from allowing aggregaters to use their content, then perhaps individual content providers could compete. However, I expect that to succeed in such an environment that the content providers would have to become desirable destinations in their own right.",1381443895

Again it&#x27;s insulting - any good scientist is highly aware of the limits of reliable knowledge - and anyway, just because there are some limits on the reliability of knowledge, doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t at least try and distinguish between more and less reliable knowledge. The religious pundits don&#x27;t want us to do so, of course, they would rather that we get shocked over the hubris of prideful scientists, and walk around &quot;knowing&quot; that everything is relative, nothing is really knowable...

If we assume this report is correct, then why? If bitcoin, (pretend with me here), is going to be the next driver in the global economy, why is it so heavily male dominated? Bitcoin is fairly anonymous and low entry. Now in our world where Bitcoin rules, if our bitcoin overlords were 92% male, who do we blame for this gender homogeneity?<p>Now, I may be ignorant in the latest innovations of public schooling, but is the problem that &quot;Brogrammers&quot; are refusing to hire women, or are women just not entering into CS/STEM tracks, and if the problem is the latter, wouldn&#x27;t it be more sustainable to force our efforts into public schooling rather than constantly remind HN that if our company doesn&#x27;t have a female mixer we are doing it wrong?<p>I really hope I&#x27;m right with this, and I&#x27;m really excited for BlackGirlsCode (<a href=""http://www.blackgirlscode.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blackgirlscode.com/</a>).

I believe a large country like China, Russia or Brazil who isn't too worried about the OECD sanctioning them are the only options.<p>I worked on a payment startup in Panama for a couple of years and know people who have attempted the same in various other offshore jurisdictions. The problem with financial innovation in these places is that you their own regulators are really scared of international sanctions.<p>Unfortunately in the end I think the best thing to do is to innovate from a grassroots level in the US or Europe. I would never have said so 10 years ago. But the OECD have been very effective in their campaign to scare previously innovative regimes.",1246564777

I know that in such a system, the simplest test is do members of the group procreate with one another.<p>For example, there are two species of crickets that live amongst each other, are capable of producing viable offspring with each other, and behave identically except for the frequency of their mating calls. When we tweak the mating calls in a lab, we can get crickets from the different groups to mate. But since they don't mix in the wild, we call them two different species.",1246564770

People make displays of wealth to attract a desirable mate and also to increase their social status. In many environments, dressing well and carrying the 'right' accessory conveys an impression of success which may be key to getting a promotion or closing a deal. Superficial it may be, but it works.<p>In this context, the features of the iPhone are no more than distracting toys. All that matters is the display, which can be effected by having a secretary or colleague call you in the middle of a meeting so you can pull out your expensive <i>looking</i> phone and say you're too important to talk right now.

Yet I feel I'm seeing the same in the U.S. as these newer generations have their ambitions stoked and their work ethic demolished.<p>Just this morning I went to Disney.com with my 3-year-old and there was a ""kite-flying"" game.  All you had to do was hit the enter key to make the kite do tricks.  And the voice over was: ""You're amazing!"", ""You're very good at kite tricks."" and ""I've <i>never seen</i> such incredible tricks.""  She was hitting the enter key randomly.<p>And I thought, ""This is so American,"" and I turned it off.  I want her to know that she is talented, but that if she wants to be good at anything she'll have to work her ass off.

What Microsoft did with artificial memory limitation is ridiculous, unless someone comes up to offer a reasonable technical explanation. However, I find it equally ridiculous to jump from there to a conclusion that open source is better because it does no market segmentation.<p>Let's keep one thing clear, if you're not selling your product then you won't do any market segmentation for it. You might, however, do market segmentation when it comes to offering support for that product. Does that make you as evil as Microsoft? Are 37 Signals evil because they offer different plans whose prices probably don't scale linearly with the costs behind them (in other words, they don't get the same profit across plans)?<p>Of course, Jeff didn't actually use the word ""evil"", but the implication of moral inferiority is almost palpable. Open source has many advantages (and disadvantages, too), but not segmenting the market is not one of those; rather, it's a consequence of not selling the software itself.",1246561964

It&#x27;s not that the candidate needs &quot;a high level of understanding&quot;, it&#x27;s that they need &quot;a high level understanding&quot;. &quot;High&quot; here is in reference to the level of abstraction.<p>A high level understanding could mean something as simple as understanding the request-acknowledge nature of TCP, as opposed to the &#x27;fire and forget&#x27; mechanism of UDP.<p>As to the claim that virtually no javascript developer needs to know TCP, that becomes less of a truth the closer you get to experimenting with tech like websockets, which is increasingly becoming part of javascript developers&#x27; jobs.<p>I think you&#x27;re latching onto a narrative that you already made up about the poster before you even began this debate.<p>There&#x27;s a large leap between what the poster is saying &quot;I ask a wide range of questions to catch red flags if they get all wrong&quot;, and what you&#x27;re saying &quot;the poster is saying that javascript devs NEED to know TCP!

Otherwise, just about everyone&#x27;s boss in here would be behind bars. <i>Sexual</i> harassment is a completely different beast. Talking about &quot;harassment&quot; in general is moving the goalposts and a distraction from the topic at hand. From the same source you just quoted, it defines <i>sexual harassment</i> as;<p><pre><code>  ...unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual
  favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a
  sexual nature.
</code></pre>
Sexual in this case means <i>sex</i>, as in coitus and other related physical stimuli, not <i>gender</i>.<p>Furthermore, even some conduct which may be considered &quot;sexual harassment&quot; is not illegal. It is only illegal if it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment. Honest complements, by definition, cannot create a hostile or offensive work environment, quite the opposite!<p>> You should actually assume a woman doesn&#x27;t want you to comment on her appearance.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about strangers, I would absolutely agree. I&#x27;m not talking about cat-calling someone in the street, I&#x27;m talking about natural conversation with coworkers and colleagues, regardless of their gender. E.g. If a colleague, male or female, comes in on Monday and their hair is a different color, I think <i>not noticing it</i> is more insulting by far.<p>> Basically, you can&#x27;t separate out, &quot;Hi [woman], you look great in that dress&quot; from &quot;Hi [woman], that dress makes me sexually attracted to you&#x27;.<p>First, actually, yes you can separate out the two. It takes a few hundred milliseconds to register the change in your interlocutor&#x27;s facial expression which tells you if they took your comment as it was intended or not. Particularly between two people who have known each other and worked together for more than a week. But even more to the point; telling a coworker you are attracted to them, guess what, it&#x27;s not sexual harassment, and it&#x27;s certainly not illegal. The law says, repeated unwanted sexual advances which are so severe that they create a hostile work environment.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m not willing to &quot;err&quot; on the side of pretending my coworkers are ethereal beings without corporeal form. If someone finds something I say or do offensive, I expect them to let me know, and I will apologize and modify my behavior. That way, even if someone believes I&#x27;m making an unwanted sexual advance, I can clarify that no, in fact, I was not talking about sex, and I can try to be more clear about that in the future. In other words, if the only way you&#x27;re comfortable working with me is by me treating you like a robot, please let me know, and I&#x27;ll do my best to accommodate you, but I sure as hell am not going to act like that toward the majority of my coworkers.",1425897770

What other things have interlinked causal relationships with these things? These realities are complicated and trying to boil it down to this college degree earns people this much is just not really the way reality works.<p>A 25 year old with a solid academic background in statistics, big data & business from name brand Universities is likely to be optimizing his earning potential. He&#x27;s very likely to be getting knowledgable advice, assistance and socialization to this end from parents. This is not a randomized experience. The got into the degree. They passed it. They decided to get into it. Causation runs both ways, in loops, in zigzags.<p>For a high school graduate with decades of experience… What circumstances yield 35 year olds without any tertiary education in 2015? The starting point is different, the trajectory is different. It&#x27;s complex.<p>Coming from a non American who quite like americans I would also point out that there are many uniquely american blind spots here. One is the mercantile approach to education. Universities can proudly and flagrantly advertise their prestige with prices and viscera versa.<p>First, the American student is a consumer and investor. This is kind of cool and useful in that it forces people to consider realities like the market demand for graduates of a degree. But it also generates the kind of flat, dull and incorrect analysis where a degree is going to be causally linked to a salary, justifying the enormous (and often unnecessary) costs. Universities need this to justify what they charge and students need to justify their spend.<p>Second, I think Americans have a very weird relationship with the concepts and vocabulary of socialism. Socialism (followed closely and arguably by Liberal Capitalism) was probably the most influentially socio-economic-political movement of the 20th century. The ideas influence the US no less than anywhere. But Americans have a weird relationship with them.<p>At the centre of it all is the aversion to considering anything from the lens of class.<p>Universities are now and have always been, central to class issues. They are where class is established. They are instruments of class mobility, class immobility. They are places where class culture is consolidated.<p>I would guess that class is a major determining factor in earning potential, and that a lot of the mechanics of this are via universities.<p>When you consider some cluster of college graduates and compare them to high school graduates with 10 years experience, you are comparing samples of class clusters.",1425897279

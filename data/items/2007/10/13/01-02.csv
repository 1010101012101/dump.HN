So why are people still using TeX/LaTeX?<p>Most people now use WYSIWYG word processors for business.  So why won't scientists & mathematicians use WYSIWYG scientific word processors such as TeXmacs?",1192240791

67109,comment,66842,67066,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> Do you think Google was afraid that Zenter would displace it?<p>No, but I think Google was afraid that it would displace Presently, its presentation software.  Since Google wants to play in the ""online office software"" market, they're afraid of someone else becoming a market leader in one of the sub-markets for that and fragmenting that market before they can dominate it.  They also bought one of Zenter's competitors.<p>> If there is a 99% chance that nobody will want to pay for it, are you really making something people want?<p>It's not enough <i>just</i> to make something people want.  You have to make it better than everyone else.<p>This is implicit in startup advice, but it applies here because we're talking about mature markets.  With startups, it's assumed that you're not going to build something someone else is already doing better, because then you're not really making something people want (they want your competitors instead).  And you don't generally worry about someone coming along with a better product later, because if you have a head-start and work your ass off, they'll want to buy you rather than spend the time, money, and risk of developing it themself.  However, if you then spurn their acquisition offer, they have no choice but to try and beat you, and there's a good chance that they will, because they have more resources.  You've still made something people want, but then you force BigCo to waste money duplicating it (and possibly duplicating it better) instead of buying you.",1192240029

Croatian mercenaries used by Louis (I think XV) used to wear red  garments around their necks. The  mercenaries had a reputation as being fantastic soldiers, and French men copied the military trend with what they called a 'Cravatte' derived from 'Croat'.<p>(My girlfriend's  in the fashion industry - she works at an Australian lingerie label now but used to work at Aqua Scutum)",1192239106

If you, or your university, have access to it, IBM's Delphion is an excellent resource (not free system).<p>I think your question is too broad and needs to be refined. <p>If you are looking to patent a software algorithm, the approach to research ideas would be very different from that for particular plants. As a general tip, search by patent class <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/go/classification/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/go/classification/</a><p>Alternatively, search the pending applications of a large company in the field you are researching. For example: <a href=""http://appft1.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appft1.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.html</a><p>And in the query field type:<p>AN/google<p>It is from the pending applications that you can look at 'prior art.'  Prior art is the list of the patents and other materials upon which a patent relies. Here is a software analogy: If a patent is source code, prior art is an <include> directive or a <lib> call. Only by mastering the existing libraries can you produce new code. Look at some source code. Then examine the libraries/include files. And then start tinkering around on producing your own source code.",1198033869

Has the added advantage that it is then trivial to split SSL encryption/decryption off to another machine if needed.",1198033285

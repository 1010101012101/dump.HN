It was originally developed with the U.S. Navy in mind, for the primary purpose of protecting government communications.&quot; The TOR website further states that their products and services are used by individuals &quot;to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, or the like when these are blocked by their local Internet providers.&quot; TOR also provides services that permit users, such as Pinkmeth, to &quot;publish web sites and other services without needing to reveal the location of the site.&quot; [...] It is clear from the TOR website that TOR is knowingly assisting websites such as Pinhneth in committing torts against Texas resident...&quot;<p>p. 5<p>&quot;However, unscrupulous Internet service companies such as TOR offer &quot;private&quot; or &quot;anonymous&quot; domain name hosting services that allow criminals such as Pinkmeth and its users to escape accountability for their actions. TOR even advertises that with their service &quot;nobody would be able to determine who was offering the site, and nobody who offered the site would know who was posting to it.&quot; [...] many unscrupulous companies offer services that allow illegal websites such as Pinkmeth to remain anonymous and difficult for authorities to shut down. Indeed Pinkmeth&#x27;s Twitter feed advertises its website as being a website &quot;where your state laws don&#x27;t apply.&quot;&quot;<p>pp. 8-9<p>&quot;The specific object to be accomplished by the conspiracy was the publication pornographic images of Plaintiff (and other women) on the Pinkmeth website in such a mannner so as to prevent its operators and users from being held civilly and criminally accountable for this unlawful behavior.&quot;<p>This seems to be conflating a few things. The fact that &quot;revenge porn&quot; sites exist outside of anonymous content distribution networks like TOR shows that anonymity wasn&#x27;t a required component in the tort allegedely commited by Pinkmeth. There are many cases involving sites like that being taken down from public hosting providers. The fact that TOR could allegedly allow defendant to escape prosecution does not equate to a real conspiracy to assist defendant in escaping prosecution. A person hosting a costume party isn&#x27;t automatically responsible for a murderer taking advantage of the anonymity to commit a crime, without some evidence of collusion.",1404939483

8012183,comment,8010101,8010101,18,0,shykes,,,"EDIT: incredibly, I&#x27;m seeing people use this benchmark to argue both 1) that Docker is bad for performance and 2) that Docker is magically faster (and probably does something stupid to be faster). Talk about an illustration of what&#x27;s wrong with benchmarks! Neither of these statements are correct. It&#x27;s possible to configure Docker for negligible performance overhead. Docker definitely does not do magic tricks to make things faster. Mostly it sets up the storage backend of your choice and then gets out of the way. Whatever you&#x27;re seeing is probably a result of your particular host configuration combined with your particular storage backend configuration.<p>My initial comment below is a detailed response to the &quot;Docker is terrible for performance&quot; camp.<p>TLDR: &quot;read the Docker manual before trying to benchmark it&quot;.<p>It looks like the guy didn&#x27;t bother to mark /var/lib/postgres as a volume, which is the recommended way of running a database in Docker. It can be fixed with the following line in his Dockerfile:<p><pre><code>    VOLUME /var/lib/postgresql\n</code></pre>\nThis will make sure his persistent (and IO-critical) data is bind-mounted from the underlying host filesystem, instead of depending on Docker&#x27;s copy-on-write backend (which could be btrfs, aufs or lvm/devmapper depending on his configuration).<p>Read the docs, fix your configuration, and try again. Hint: the IO overhead will be negligible. Also: it will end up being a benchmark of your underlying host storage, not of Docker.",1404939231

Do we really expect doctors, architects others high profile professions to work during many months suboptimally, requiring special mentoring, just to use new tools ?

One of the bolts is used as an electrical ground. Unfortunately we had broken this bolt in removing the original module.<p>Furthermore the back of the unit uses the manifold as a sort of heatsink. So that missing bolt was preventing good thermal conductivity as well!<p>We had come up with temporary measures to restore the ground -- but clearly these measures were inadequate.<p>The factory mount is in a very inaccessible spot: there&#x27;s simply not enough room to drill out the remains of an automotive grade bolt and re-tap the hole.<p>A friend and I had fabricated a &quot;mounting adapter&quot; and were toying with the idea of remote mounting the module. However we couldn&#x27;t find a suitable spot on the car that would provide a clean electrical ground. (Without stressing the factory wiring harness.)<p>My roommate, a machinist and most certainly not a car guy, points to a flat surface and asks if it&#x27;s &quot;solid enough&quot; to bolt the adapter plate to.<p>What he had pointed to was the power steering pump. Which for obvious reasons we could not drill into.<p>---<p>However that suggestion ended up being the catalyst I needed to solve the problem. It was as if the whole engine bay became a puzzle.<p>You see: power steering pumps are made to be removed far more frequently than an intake manifold.<p>Initially I had thought the only way to repair the factory mount was to remove the intake manifold, which is an arduous task that involves removing many delicate assemblies for emissions and fueling.<p>Removing the power steering pump, though, was a considerably easier task! This would open up plenty of room in the engine bay; we could even use a typical cordless drill.<p>---<p>Inspiration sometimes comes from the oddest places.<p>How to act on the proper solution (repairing the factory mounting plate) had eluded me for six months.<p>An absolutely bonkers suggestion ended up leading me down a much simpler path to success.",1404938472

He proposes that a data service layer can abstract these implementations, making it easier to swap out data stores as needed. I think that&#x27;s a good idea. Separating our applications from data store specifics is a big reason why we use ORMs and ODMs today.<p>However, I think there are challenges with this polygot data store architecture that he doesn&#x27;t address. Each addition requires due diligence to understand its CAP trade-offs (which the author mentions briefly), scalability and performance characteristics, how to configure, etc. These are non-trivial concerns even for a single database. It&#x27;s important to consider these challenges when building out a data store or data service.<p>I&#x27;d propose an architecture where the data services layer itself exposes different data models to the application, all of which are persisted in a single data store. Given that many data stores use a key-value store under the covers anyway, translating the specific data model down to a single, persistent data store would simplify operations while exposing the desired data model to the application. (As a caveat, this multi-model approach requires ACID transactions to ensure strict consistency when translating between data models.) This approach provides operational simplicity with just one data store and application efficiency by exposing the &quot;right&quot; data model API.<p>Full disclosure: I&#x27;m an engineer at FoundationDB, a database that provides ACID-compliant polygot data models on a single key-value data store (<a href=""http://www.foundationdb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foundationdb.com</a>).",1404937727

You&#x27;ve decided that since they&#x27;re not literally dying from starvation then they deserve no sympathy and no help.<p>I for one would prefer to live in a world where poverty of the sort seen in your picture doesn&#x27;t exist. Part of achieving that is being willing to help out others when they hit hard times but aren&#x27;t necessarily on the verge of death. Raising the standard of living means just that: it means raising the base expectation of what life as a human being entails. When someone faces trouble and falls below that base expectation, others jump in to help.<p>The worst sin this couple did, as far as I can tell, is they bought some root beer with food stamps and didn&#x27;t sell a car which they very much needed for reliable transportation. They used the government help when they needed it, then regained employment and are once again self-sufficient. This is exactly what these social services are for.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose they got no help at all, like you seem to think would have been fair. They probably would have had to sell the car in order to feed their children (and themselves). They would have soon lost all modes of personal transportation, in fact, because their Honda broke down (and are you going to spend cash to repair it when you need every dime you have for food?). Therefore, they would have relied almost entirely on public transportation. The difficulty of finding new employment just doubled, meaning that the length of time they face poverty probably also just doubled.<p>But selling that car didn&#x27;t fix the fundamental mathematical problem of &quot;income < expenses.&quot; It only provided temporary capital at the expense of personal transportation and probably employment, meaning it actually exacerbated the <i>real</i> problem, which is increasing <i>income</i> rather than immediate cash reserves.<p>Oh, and by the way, back when they were making $120k, and now again that they have decent income again, they were (and now are again) paying so that <i>others</i> can receive the same help in similar situations.",1404937669

The answer is it&#x27;s extremely hard . Even if you are a tech startup with a hot idea and amazing growth potential, it&#x27;s still really hard to raise funds from investors who don&#x27;t know you when you don&#x27;t have much to show for your company. After all, 8 out of 10 entrepreneurs who start businesses fail within the first 18 months. Investors/Lenders rarely fund companies at this stage — however, there are other options.<p>The following are 6 viable ways to fund young businesses. Keep in mind these options are still hard — they either require a lot of time investment or have very high cost. We recommend that you write up a solid business plan before you start fundraising. You might also want to consider the following options in tandem with 1) waiting for some time until you save up the capital or 2) starting small with minimal costs.<p>Continue to read here\nhttps://www.fundastic.com/posts/59-5-funding-options-for-young-businesses",1404937639
8012063,comment,8001625,8002426,1,0,atoponce,,,"This doesn&#x27;t hold up for a number of reasons.<p>First, the client should be actively and asynchronously working on the puzzle when the page loads, so when the submit button is pressed, the puzzle is solved, and ready to be submitted to the server. Asynchronous JavaScript has already been solved. Even for a Raspberry Pi, a 16-byte Hashcash puzzle can likely be solved before the user has finished typing in the form.<p>Second, the point of Hashcash is to stop spammers from mass POST attempts. Form spammers rely on bots, without JavaScript, to mass POST to forms, millions of times per day. As soon as JavaScript is required, this immediately stops 90% of the bots in use, right now. Of course, they&#x27;ll adapt, with JavaScript VM bots if Hashcash is the norm, which then ties up the client solving the puzzle. The longer the client is tied up, the less it can spam in a given amount of time. It _drastically_ slows down the amount of comments a spammer or zombie network can perform. As computing gets more powerful, the Hashcash minting size can be increased, to continue tying up the bots. &quot;Blowing through them&quot; couldn&#x27;t be a bigger exaggeration and further from the truth.<p>Third, properly implemented Hashcash is designed to prevent double spending. So, once the token is spent, it cannot be spent again. Even better implementations will not allow tokens that have not been minted within a certain timeframe, such as 24 hours. The Hashcash specification has the timestamp as part of the token. This discourages mining the tokens early, for spending later.<p>Lastly, captchas have shown to be entirely ineffective against bots. Do a search for beating captchas, and you&#x27;ll see the sad state of affairs. Captchas are getting harder for humans to interpret, because bots are getting better at OCR, and defeating them, with increasing reliability. In every instance I&#x27;ve deployed Hashcash into a web form, I have yet to see spam come through. In one site, as of the time of this writing, Hashcash is solely responsible for blocking 670,624 spam POST attempts in a 10 year run.<p>The big drawback, is forcing JavaScript to be enabled, in able to POST to a form.  From what I&#x27;ve seen on the virtual web hosts I administer, it seems to be about 10% of the web traffic has JavaScript disabled, on average. This might be acceptable, and it might not.",1404937580

8012001,comment,8010061,8011456,4,0,mjw,,,"> you need to formulate the desired computation algorithmically instead of just poking around the data. This has proved to be a formidable barrier.<p>Very true. Furthermore, if you start to think seriously about making differential privacy guarantees across a whole company, it gets really hard and impractical.<p>It&#x27;s not enough, as you might naively hope, to certify individual data analysis jobs separately as being &quot;differentially private&quot;. Taken cumulatively they can amount to something which isn&#x27;t [1]<p>It&#x27;s not even sufficient to certify whole planned and delimited programmes of use for whole datasets as differentially private, if the company also holds (or wants to hold in future) other data on some of the same users and there&#x27;s some chance of new actions being taken which directly or indirectly depend on both sources of data.<p>For the theory to truly apply, one needs to track (in a particular formal sense) how much &quot;privacy budget&quot; is used up by pretty much every user-data-dependent action taken across a company and across all datasets you hold pertaining to any overlapping set of users. Once your preallocated budget is used up it&#x27;s pretty much game over in terms of taking any further actions based on any data (acquired now or in future) on any of those users, unless these actions can be based on inferences which were already obtained within the original budget.<p>These aren&#x27;t necessarily insurmountable problems, and I&#x27;m sure there are new tools being developed to help which I&#x27;m not up to date with. (One which I am aware of is Microsoft&#x27;s PINQ project [2]).<p>Still, it seems the organisations with the biggest chance of actually making this work, are those whose relationships with sets of users are inherently transitory and/or firewalled off from eachother. For example a B2B company who operate one-off surveys for clients, throwing away the raw data afterwards.<p>The fundamental problem is that differential privacy guarantees a degree of resistance to an incredibly strong adversary -- one with unlimited prior knowledge about your users, who is able to bring unlimited intelligence and computational resources to bear on drawing inferences about them based on every action you ever take conditional on user data. It&#x27;s impressive that one can obtain any guarantees at all under this model, but perhaps not surprising that it can be hard to scale up and compose the guarantees without things blowing up.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t value in trying to obtain differential privacy guarantees for smaller scale pieces of work. It&#x27;s still considerably better than other more naive pseudo-anonymisation methods.<p>[1] at least not to the same strength -- see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy#Composability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy#Composabil...</a> for the less handwavey version\n[2] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/PINQ/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/PINQ/</a>",1404936917

8011966,comment,8011355,8011355,20,0,monxxx,,,"from Grothendieck&#x27;s <i>Récoltes et Semailles</i>:<p><pre><code>    In those critical years I learned how to be alone. [But even] this\n    formulation doesn’t really capture my meaning. I didn’t, in any\n    literal sense, learn to be alone, for the simple reason that this\n    knowledge had never been unlearned during my childhood. It is a basic\n    capacity in all of us from the day of our birth. However these three\n    years of work in isolation [1945-1948], when I was thrown onto my own\n    resources, following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously\n    invented, instilled in me a strong degree of confidence, unassuming\n    yet enduring in my ability to do mathematics, which owes nothing to\n    any consensus or to the fashions which pass as law. By this I mean\n    to say: to reach out in my own way to the things I wished to learn,\n    rather than relying on the notions of the consensus, overt or tacit,\n    coming from a more or less extended clan of which I found myself a\n    member, or which for any other reason laid claim to be taken as an\n    authority. This silent consensus had informed me both at the lycee\n    and at the university, that one shouldn’t bother worrying about\n    what was really meant when using a term like “volume” which\n    was “obviously self-evident”, “generally known,” “in\n    problematic” etc... it is in this gesture of ”going beyond to be\n    in oneself rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay\n    within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one -- it is in\n    this solitary act that one finds true creativity. All others things\n    follow as a matter of course.\n\n    Since then I’ve had the chance in the world of mathematics that\n    bid me welcome, to meet quite a number of people, both among my\n    “elders” and among young people in my general age group who were\n    more brilliant, much more ‘gifted’ than I was. I admired the\n    facility with which they picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling\n    them as if familiar with them from the cradle -- while for myself I\n    felt clumsy, even oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track,\n    like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things I had to\n    learn (so I was assured) things I felt incapable of understanding\n    the essentials or following through to the end. Indeed, there was\n    little about me that identified the kind of bright student who wins\n    at prestigious competitions or assimilates almost by sleight of hand,\n    the most forbidding subjects.\n\n    In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more brilliant\n    than I have gone on to become distinguished mathematicians. Still\n    from the perspective of thirty or thirty five years, I can state\n    that their imprint upon the mathematics of our time has not been\n    very profound. They’ve done all things, often beautiful things in\n    a context that was already set out before them, which they had no\n    inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained\n    prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the\n    universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To have broken these\n    bounds they would have to rediscover in themselves that capability\n    which was their birthright, as it was mine: The capacity to be alone.</code></pre>",1404936637

8011957,comment,7999187,7999348,1,0,mrtimesizingcom,,,"Sooo many errors in this sneering and ahistorical post.\nFrance voted-in that famous and world-leading 35-hour workweek as a 4-hour jumpdown from a 39-hour workweek in 1997 when unemployment was 12.6%. It took complete hold in early 2001 after several delays but with many companies anticipating. And before the US-led recession hit France in summer 2001, unemployment had come down to 8.6%. That&#x27;s 1% less unemployment per hourcut, same result as the USA got in 1938-40 when the overtime section of the Fair Labor Standards Act set the maximum workweek at 44-42-40 in 1938-39-40 and unemployment went 19.0%-17.2%-14.6%.\nThe &quot;disaster&quot; claimed is indeed just a dramatization of a cluster of tacticl problems as mentioned in Clavalle&#x27;s comment below.\nThe &quot;infamous&quot; &quot;radical&quot; &quot;disastrous&quot; 35-hour workweek was adopted by some of the most conservative industries in the USA as early as the 1950s, such as insurance and academe. The workweek for clerks in that radical! industry on Wall Street was 37.5 hours in the 1960s. &quot;2pasc&quot; seems to be very easily &quot;surprised and disappointed&quot; indeed, possibly assumes that Moses brought down the frozen Forty Hour Work Week from Mt. Sinai along with the Ten Commandments, when in fact, between 1840 and 1940 the American workweek was cut in half, from over 80 to 40, via the fight for the 10-hour day generally achieved by 1865, and then the fight for the 8-hour day.\nThe 35-hr wkwk&#x27;s problem is the same as the 40. No level is permanently freezable when we are not frozen at the same level of worksaving technology. And when productive innovation is constantly injected against a workweek frozen at any level, however low-sounding to current ears, it gets responded-to by downsizing, leaving us with the folly of trying to get growth=UPsizing by downsizing. So yes, it should have been further lowered. In fact, as outlined in timesizingdotcom, chronic overtime needs to be energetically converted into training&hiring and the workweek needs to be regularly and repeatedly adjusted downward, as far as it takes, to create enough convertible overtime to achieve full employment and maximum consumer spending. The USA nationally hasn&#x27;t nicked the workweek one nanosecond since 1940 and the resulting overt and covert downsizing has resulted in mind-boggling welfare, &#x27;disability,&#x27; homelessness, begging, crime, a world-record prison population, suicide, longer&longer hours due to job insecurity, lots of quiet featherbedding, employee pilferage and sabotage, and clientless self-&#x27;employment&#x27;, all of which people who talk the talk of freedom but are leary of the real thing, like &quot;2pasc&quot;, seem to overlook or be OK with. But many &quot;smartest minds&quot; would prefer a world-leading low workweek to a world-leading prison population.\nThe real freedom? the most basic freedom? Free Time, without which the other freedoms are meaningless or inaccessible. The promise of technology is to make life easier for everyone. That promise is betrayed when technology is responded-to by downsizing. That promise is only kept and delivered-upon when technology is responded-to by what might be called timesizing, as much as it takes to maintain or raise employment and economy-anchoring domestic consumer spending. Otherwise you get the Ford-Reuther Paradox: Henry Ford, &quot;Let&#x27;s see you unionize these robots!&quot; Walter Reuther, &quot;Let&#x27;s see you sell&#x27;em cars.&quot;",1404936529

Using obscure, pseudorandom server names is a good example of this.  If I get an alert that says, &quot;uxeprdweb05 is down&quot;, I know to immediately check the Mason, OH, production hypervisor cluster/web server rack.  If the alert says, &quot;I-2A51DDBCE621 is down&quot;, I have to look up that host in my CMDB before starting any troubleshooting.  Sure, &quot;uxeprdweb05&quot; leaks information to attackers, but it&#x27;s nothing they couldn&#x27;t find out with a port scan.  In the meantime, I and my colleagues don&#x27;t have to go through a lot of unnecessary indirection to do our jobs.<p>As to the security benefits of configuration management tools, again, speaking as an infosec guy, I love them.  I can push a locked-down, default-deny base config out to all of the computers under my care, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about making a mistake or missing a step or forgetting to document something.  I can work with the devops team to set up automated functional and security testing using a continuous integration tool, so that config changes (including security updates!) get vetted automatically in a development or test environment before being pushed to production.  I can put the whole config under revision control, so if there is a service or security incident due to a config change, we can figure out how our development and testing processes failed us - and how we can improve them.<p>And finally, speaking as a ardent FreeBSD user, I wholly agree that Ubuntu is utter rubbish.<p>;)",1404936387

I’m available at steve at estimote dot com. Estimote has been 100% focused on making the initial experience with developers easy and fast. As such we’re selling the hardware as a kit for $99. But we don’t charge that much for bulk beacon orders. The challenge with deploying 1,000 beacons is not the beacon cost as you point out – it’s in security, extensibility and all the elements of RAS that a networking protocol carries with it. In fact all of those are smaller parts of your overall cost, which is to build a mobile app and experience. We understand that. These deployments are much more similar to enterprise Wi-Fi in that regard – access points are a small percentage of the deployment of Wi-Fi. In fact, even one site deployment of beacons which needs to be switched out (say due to failure) would cost more than the beacons themselves. Which is why saving a few thousand dollars on beacons makes no sense.  Trust me we’re tripling down on 100% fully integrated hw / sw in order to create the tools and end to end experience that developers need to be successful.",1404936192

If any of you guys would be willing to show your parents the link if they&#x27;re interested in donating, that would be extremely helpful.\nIt is tax deductible if you&#x27;re wondering!\nThese kids are extremely intelligent, but due to financial circumstances outside of their power, they struggle immensely with school fees. If we can ensure these kids receive a proper education, they will contribute positively to their countries, Nigeria and Tanzania, and the world in the future.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t want to donate, sharing the link with some friends would be helpful as well.<p>Thanks!\nSamarth",1404936085

Something like &quot;A hole is bored through a sphere such that the void in the remaining material has the shape of a cylinder 6 inches tall&quot;.<p>I guess the overall idea is anyway to reveal the elegant mathematical result. Wikipedia does a good job of talking clearly about it:<p><i>In geometry, the volume of a band of specified height around a sphere—the part that remains after a hole in the shape of a circular cylinder is drilled through the sphere—does not depend on the sphere&#x27;s radius.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napkin_ring_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napkin_ring_problem</a>",1404936052

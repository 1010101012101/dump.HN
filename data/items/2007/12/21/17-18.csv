Also different teachers with different styles have different effects on different students.  What I would like to see is series of video lessons by various teachers on a given topic in a neatly organized environment.  For example, I would love a site that had links for History, Math , Science, etc.  Under Math there would be links for Algebra, Geometry, Calculus, etc.  Under Calculus there would be links like \nDifferential Calculus in 38 lessons by Dr. Math Guy.\nCalculus in 3 lessons by Dr. Talks To Fast\nCalculus in 7362 lessons for slow people\netc.<p>Anyone know of such a place?",1198259604

Do it.<p>SuccessProbability = (Ability + CompetitiveAdvantage + Preserverance) * Passion<p>If Passion = 0, nothing else matters.<p>Market size doesn't affect the probability of success.

The question you should be asking (yourself) is: ""what do I have a competitive advantage in""? Call it what you want and classify it however you will -Zipfs law, paretos curve, The Long Tail, Common Sense - and you will find that competing in the ""most profitable online markets"" is no sure way to profitability. Its winner-take-all (almost), so don't let the dollars distract you.",1198258635

Of course, if you can enter into a market that already has big players and actually push those players out then that is even better. If they need money they can come and work for you.",1198258480

I created a smart list that shows all the tasks I have completed so far because if you only make it show you what you have to do, it can be overwhelming, but if you use it to show also what you have already acomplished, that sort of balances out the effect.",1198257934

1880277,comment,1879764,1880062,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> The more bizarre and nonsensical the ""security"" restrictions, the better protected officials are from blame when the inevitable attacks finally occur.<p>I believe that is true for other security theaters as well. A large bank, for example, instead of hiring in-house security experts, might contract out their security to an outside firm. Not because it is necessarily cheaper or the consulting company will do a better job, but because they can be blamed if something goes wrong.<p>A security breach happens, shareholders are up-in-arms, C*Os tell them ""we hired the best, we payed them a lot of money, if they can't protect our data, nobody can.""<p>The security firm in the meantime has to do their best to project themselves as ""the experts"". Usually carefully chosen stock photography of people in the business suits smiling and talking on the phone on the front page of their  website, and the ability of the salesman to play and _lose_ at golf does the trick.<p>TSA does the same thing. They are the scapegoats. So when shit hits the fan, nobody can point out to the politicians and say ""you fucked up"". Security theater is not pointless, it has an exact purpose, and that is to protect and serve (the government) from future blame.",1289162601

Seriously, Dell servers are just brilliantly put together.<p>They manage to combine small margins with a decent product. Everyone wins.<p>On the R&D front, Apple is a marginal investor in R&D.

So yes, concerted letter-writing campaigns can have an effect.<p>We even saw some of that in action with the bailout.  Recall that the first bailout bill <i>failed</i>, despite heavy pressure from Wall Street, because of a mostly-Internet-organized letter writing campaign.  Then they turned around and passed it with minor edits a week later, when everyone was celebrating their victory.<p>The problem is that legislators typically work on an out-of-sight, out-of-mind basis, so once they count up all the letters and cast their vote, they forget all about general public opinion.  Professional lobbyists know this, and so they live and work in Washington and make sure to schedule regular dinners and outings with the legislators so that whatever concerns are on their minds stay on the legislators' minds too.<p>Ordinary citizens don't have this luxury, and the collective Internet hive mind isn't exactly known for attention span.  I bet that if you got a Reddit-scale letter-writing campaign going <i>and kept it up for a year</i>, with every person writing in once a week or so, you'd see meaningful change in this country.

Just as much, I don't want to have my airline tickets, my digital camera or my laptop marketed to any of my personas - it was the generically good at the lowest price (I'd suspect this is why a reaction to insurance-rate based on browser use resonated with people regardless of its truth).<p>I mean, historically, our modern capitalist society has evolved on the basis of creating more roles that people enter and leave (That Max Weber-101 folks). Job, friends and family were separated a while ago and most people would prefer they remain separate (we're far enough along that no remembers jobs passed from father to son but I'd assume it sucked). Indeed, I'd say there's a big demand now for easy tools to keep family and job separate.<p>It should be remembered that the ubiquity of the web is going mean that the new of ""naive users"" as a percentage of the total online population is only going to be <i>decreasing</i> from now or from a time soon in the future.

They were a half-assed hardware company that could not keep up in price or performance and didn't even bother to let others develop system software for it, and they were a half-assed software company that didn't bother to port their software to other computers (a $10,000 plug-in board for a Macintosh does not count as a port).<p>They were also a pretty good computer graphics and computer algebra software company, and both those divisions got sold off and continued their work for a number of years after Symbolics itself went out of business.<p>It's interesting to note that by the time of Symbolics' demise (I'm placing it at 1993ish, although that's probably not accurate), even IBM realized that developing systems as integrated software/hardware architectures was not feasible.",1289162012

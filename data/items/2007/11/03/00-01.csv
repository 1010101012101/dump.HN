75670,comment,75422,75663,0,0,machine,,,"I don't know a lot about ILP algorithms, but my understanding of them is that they basically search the space of logical rules for rules that ""explain"" the examples they are given.  More formally, they look for rules from which you could then prove the given examples.  So in an ideal world you could give an ILP system a bunch of formulas and it would give you back the Peano axioms or something like that  I'm not sure if state of the art ILP systems are good enough to do that in practice or not.",1194050855

75667,comment,75422,75659,0,0,pixcavator,,,"If the input is numbers then what happens is simply extrapolation (or regression etc). If the input is symbols, then what? The fact that you can associate numbers to the symbols does not help. The extrapolation will be meaningless. Unless you happen to have the correspondence '1'->1, '2'->2, etc,",1194050109
75666,comment,75470,75470,0,0,apathy,,,"I worked at Google for a while, pre-IPO.  There were an awful lot of very smart, capable people (or so it seemed, out of the 200 or so that were there when I arrived), and the challenges in operations simply do not exist at any other company I have seen (you try administering 100K servers, expanding by about another 1000-2000 per week, using typical methods, and let me know how it goes, for example (%)).  The hardware engineering produced numerous clever patents, the software engineers produced stuff like MapReduce, and despite the North Korean Labor Camp work ethos, people were generally pretty happy.<p>I have no idea if it's like that anymore.  A lot of my friends who stuck around after the IPO report that it changed, that there arose much friction between the perceived old guard and the newer post-IPO employees.  Maybe now that there are a zillion Googlers in a dozen or so countries (Ireland, Switzerland, India, China, and teh USA were already set up by the time I left), perhaps there's less camaraderie.  Maybe the SarbOx role-based access control (which I helped implement as part of my job) means that you can't poke around MOMA and the Perforce tree after work hours and gawk at the new patents.  <p>It was a great place to work, but in the end I moved on because I didn't get the position I really wanted to be promoted to, and I noticed that all of the guys doing really, really cool stuff had completed some advanced study, more often than not in CS or comp bio.<p>Given that machine learning doesn't seem to be going out of style, I have to try and remember that $80K or so is really not a very good salary for the amount of work that an SRE drone is responsible for, and figure out 'what next' instead.<p>I didn't have a wife or a kid when I left Google.  Now I do.  It's harder now to embrace the risks of starting up a company, although I made a sizable chunk of change in the meantime simply by developing and selling a hobby website.  If the idea is solid and the execution solid, there's at least some chance that even the 'just for fun' projects will end up putting a roof over your head (literally, in my case).<p>I'm still conflicted, but I like to think that the mathematical and computational skills I've picked up in the meantime (especially modern statistical methodology, and applications in comp bio and machine learning) will continue to provide me with fun stuff to work on, regardless of what happens at Google.  If it weren't on the opposite side of town, though, I'd be tempted to apply for a different job at Google once I finish my thesis.  Hopefully I'll have something better to do with my life than be a cog, though.<p>(%) ps.  If you've ever wondered whether it's better to automate everything up-front at your Little Start-Up: yes it is.  You're not going to have any more time to deal with it if you succeed, and if your company stagnates, automation will make it easier to walk away and do something else.\n",1194050045

75662,comment,75642,75642,0,0,hwork,,,"I think the most important thing Blake mentions here is the amount of customization required per network.  Obviously, each system is not the same: they have different features, conventions, permissions, etc.  But it'll be interesting to see whether or not developers can keep one application in its own branch in source or will they literally have to have multiple instances, one for each network.  <p>If development feels like doing one app 14 times instead of one app once, that'll suck, but at least things will be familiar when you are duplicating code.  Interesting to see how well this works. Roll, Google. ",1194049655

75660,comment,75422,75656,0,0,machine,,,"What you are talking about is more along the lines of inductive logic programming, where the goal is to induce general symbolic rules from specific examples.  Even with ILP I'm not sure how exactly you could phrase things so that the machine could learn ""addition"" though.  An ILP system could probably learn something like a + b = c implies b + a = c (i.e.  commutativity) and other properties of addition from examples.",1194049157

You could be feeding it stock quotes, rgb pixel values, your daily weight, anything.

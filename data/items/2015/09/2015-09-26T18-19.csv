On the opposite side, Redis provide a lot of primitive very fast and implemented in C that allow for more complex use cases. For instance, in one of the project I was following, the ability to merge two or more sorted set was pivotal in implementing a more efficient warm-up scheme. I could get the same result with Memcached and a software layer, but it would be less efficient in term of latency and bandwidth.
Given these huge advantages, my choice is almost always Redis because I prefer to manage one system instead of two.",1443293831

That includes people I&#x27;d lost contact with BEFORE the Internet even began.<p>Most people who aren&#x27;t on Facebook aren&#x27;t starting newsletters, they&#x27;re just isolated - maybe one of their friends sends them a newsletter.

Before email, even, it came in the form of Christmas Letters, including with the Christmas cards. And they absolutely serve a purpose for one-way communication out to people. TinyLetter sounds like it would meet that need nicely.<p>Of course, it cannot be too frequent. Family members and friends who send out mass updates too often end up being ignored, just like frequent Facebook updates. And that is because it is one-way communication. It is missing the core piece of asking how the recipients of the email have been, and engaging in a one-on-one conversation, even if just a brief one via email. (Posting a note at the end saying, &quot;Please reply to tell me how you are doing.&quot; does not count.)<p>For my own communications, I am not on social media. I call family every week or so. Sunday afternoons are a web of phone calls between us all. For old friends, I send emails periodically, one or twice a year at least. And news gets less frequent as you age. You aren&#x27;t moving, you have the same job, the kids are 6 months older, but no real news.

I also expect that 99%+ of people trying to decide between Redis and Memcached will never get into that territory. Redis is <i>so</i> fast that unless you&#x27;re doing O(n) operations on very large data sets, you&#x27;re unlikely to notice any substantial differences.<p>The other thing about caching is that the data is, by its nature, disposable and rebuildable. So even in the extreme minority case where Redis would no longer be sufficient, migration from one KV cache system to another is about as easy as it gets. Pre-optimizing your caching layer stack for Facebook levels of traffic isn&#x27;t even justifiable from a lock-in standpoint like it might be with other data storage needs.<p>In the case of your average Sidekiq user, serving cache fragments for a Rails app, memcached vs redis for your caching layer is almost certainly an inconsequential choice WRT the performance of your application, and the choice of Redis reduces your ops and client library overhead.

The problem with your framing is that trying to enhance the &quot;rights&quot; of men has a tendency to make our current problems worse. The things men typically need in order to live more balanced, healthy, full lives is an ability to provide self care instead of relying on a woman to do it, slack time that they rarely get, and so on. You could discuss that in terms of rights, but that isn&#x27;t really what most people will think of when you talk about rights for men. Rights for children are legally limited because their decision making ability is still formative.<p>Rights for women have a well established and proven track record of counterbalancing the deficiencies of the so called &quot;patriarchy&quot;, a term I loathe but I don&#x27;t know how else to frame this particular point. Rights for women often revolve around things like maternity leave, which helps protect both the health of the child and the career of the mother.

Unless you just mean because of population growth, but we&#x27;ve always needed to build new infrastructure to handle that, and the next 40 years won&#x27;t be any different.<p>If anything, self-driving cars will reduce the (relative) number of cars on the road. Several reasons:<p>1. Since they will probably finish their journey faster than a human driver, they won&#x27;t be on the road for as long.<p>2. Once we hit critical mass of self-driving cars, we can get rid of taxis (and Uber and all that), in favor of calling a self-driving car to come pick you up. These cars won&#x27;t need to be out on the road trolling for passengers.<p>3. By the time we have 100% self-driving cars I guarantee you there will be multiple companies that are in the business of automatically arranging carpooling, which will mean more people per car (and therefore fewer cars).<p>4. We&#x27;ll still have the option to use busses, or mass transit, like we do today. Self-driving cars might even make those options more appealing; take mass transit to the nearest stop, have a self-driving car take you the rest of the way (as opposed to driving the whole distance yourself).<p>Also, once we reach critical mass of self-driving cars, we can start exploring other infrastructure options for moving self-driving vehicles around besides surface roads. Remember crazy-looking highways for self-driving cars in I, Robot? I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll end up with something that looks like that, but that&#x27;s the general idea.",1443290947

10283870,comment,10283523,10283742,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"To back up littletimmy&#x27;s point, I very much as a male have been the subject of it. I was persistently and relentlessly trolled for well over a year in some of the online communities I frequented when I was younger, and it has had an effect on me. I would dare say a somewhat positive one, in that it fueled a certain level of misanthropy and cynicism that influenced me to educate myself on the human condition and thus read on subjects that would nominally be considered outside my age group. I have thankfully mellowed out quite a bit since then, and none of this excuses the original actions, but it&#x27;s not all grim.<p>And, conversely, the Internet is not all rosy. The fact of the matter is we&#x27;ve opened up a real Pandora&#x27;s box. This is the first time in human history we&#x27;ve enabled people to <i>really</i> be bombarded by public opinion in instant, rapid numbers at every moment they express a viewpoint. It&#x27;s the first time the marketplace of ideas is out there in its true colors. Humans simply aren&#x27;t used to this. It&#x27;s perfectly normal that a lot will break down at the immense cognitive overload.<p>However, one thing annoys me. The idea that this is purely a women&#x27;s issue, and how it&#x27;s presented as a culture war over gender and feminism. In fact, this is a very recent development, and it seems to me that the zeitgeist on the subject changes cyclically. It used to be trolling, and it was acknowledged it happened to everyone. Don&#x27;t feed the trolls, don&#x27;t share public info on the Internet. But then, as social media totally subverted that, it became &quot;cyberbullying&quot;. And though it was still acknowledged it occurred to all, it became a matter of imminent policy decision. Now, it has gone further off the edge. It&#x27;s no longer trolling or cyberbullying, it&#x27;s harassment and it has suddenly been morphed into an identity politics issue. What tripe.<p>I expect that soon this will change, of course. Some other neologism or term with a corresponding narrative will usurp the current gender feminist understanding. That&#x27;s how it appears to work, observing prior historical precedent.<p>The way I see it, there&#x27;s two real options: a) Humans must adapt to this new circumstance and learn to be more resilient in the face of a new reality, one where they are under constant global supervision for their words, or b) We must lower our dependence on the Internet and have decent analog/low-tech fallbacks to how our societal institutions operate instead of marching in full digital for everything. The latter, quite clearly will <i>not</i> happen. This leaves us with a).<p>Regulatory decisions will not work. The regulatory bodies do not understand the problem. I don&#x27;t think any of us do. We have to learn to deal with the revolution we have started, as there&#x27;s no reversing it.",1443290939

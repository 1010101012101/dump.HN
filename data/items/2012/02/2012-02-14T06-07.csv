Read extra careful, and you will find no evidence whatsoever of that, only evidence of me discussing human behavior in light of rule changes, and how it is a particularly sensitive topic in the ""anything goes spaces"". Further I am pointing benefits of those spaces, without actually taking a stance on them. This is how I know you are the morality police, you are choosing to invent words to put in my statements without actually bothering to read them. Those are not the actions of a reasonable person, but rather a lynch mob.<p><i>Bullshit. Let me clear up this analogy. I'm saying we have a rule against murder and it's a good rule. You're saying it's a dangerous rule that will lead us down the road to serfdom.</i><p>Again not sure where you get this idea... I am simply discussing how people react when rules start encroaching on free-form places, and discussing the consequences of them. This is not declaring serfdom or anything else nearly as dramatic. It is merely me not instantly jumping on a bandwagon. Sorry to be that guy you hate: the one who looks at the world around him and asks questions before deciding.<p><i>There's a rule at most community pools that you don't crap or piss in the pool.

So while I suppose there could be a site teaching about fundamentals of composition, line, form, color, typography, etc, I'd think you'd be better off reading a book on those than anything else.

Someone from FC wanted me to confirm a few connections and the relevant part of my original response is below (I imagine most people ignored FC and a lot of replies were trimmed -- all mention of my co-founder is gone!):<p>=====<p>It turns out three YC company founders used to all play in the same corporate basketball team back in Microsoft around 2004-2006!  It was [redacted] and myself (RentHop).   At the time we were all working on Windows Phone 6.0 and Blackberry was our biggest competitor (pre-iPhone days), so the name of our team was the RimBusters; a pretty deceiving name since our entire team consisted of short Asian guys averaging out at about 5'7"".   We didn't all leave at the same time though, but certainly knowing just a few other people go the risky founder route made the task seem more manageable.<p>Also, Lux Chen (Anywhere.fm), Anson Tsai (CardPool) and I used to all be connected on a team as well, though this one less athletic and physical, more nerdy and virtual.  We were all fairly bored at our software jobs and had plenty of free time for video games.   We've joked about this many times but I increasingly believe it is true: playing competitive video games might be a good test of whether someone is a suitable co-founder.  Not only do you see someone's raw competitive ability and persistence, but you gain a lot of insight into how they behave and treat others during moments of stress and low morale.  I also learned quickly that a person's raw ability in solo playing is not nearly as important as how well the two of you mesh as a team, hence it's better to partner up with a compatible friend than simply the most skilled person you can find.  You probably think I'm over-dramatizing here but I've got an incredible number of both positive and negative data points; I almost want to do a Starcraft trial now before I ever agree to partner up with someone!

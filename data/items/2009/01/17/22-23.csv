The last 60 years have been a disaster for the Middle East, and any action from either side can be ""justified"" with pointing at something the other side has done.<p>There have been attempts to make peace, but there have been too many demands that the other side can't accept. This can only be solved by one of the sides letting history be history and try to make a real attempt at peace. I think Israel, as the dominant party, should withdraw to the borders of 1967 and that the Palestinians should accept a multi-national peace keeping force that would stabilize the region and prevent further attacks on Israel.<p>It might take a couple of generations for the two sides to forgive each other, but it is worth a try.",1232232766

If you need to move beyond it, just drop it in the trash and you're done. A few hints:<p>- By default, the apache doc directory is mapped to an os directory inside of the MAMP folder. Change this to something in your ~ directory right away so that if you upgrade MAMP, you won't accidentally write over your work.<p>- Make sure MAMP dirs are at the beginning of your shell path because there are conflicting binaries pre-installed in OS X (basic, I know).<p>- In my opinion, the MAMP PRO upgrade is worth it. It gives you much finer control over many things.<p>- I've only compiled and installed the memcache pecl extension and I did that through the standard make/install process and it worked fine. I just had to drop the memcache.so file into the proper directory and find the right php.ini file to edit to enable it. See this post (and my comment -- 2nd from the end -- to see how to configure MAMP PRO): <a href=""http://www.lullabot.com/articles/setup-memcached-mamp-sandbox-environment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lullabot.com/articles/setup-memcached-mamp-sandbo...</a>.

This is because sharpness, framing may vary or the automatic lens change between commercials and the movie may screw things up.<p>I worked in a small theater with only 4 screens, but it was hectic none the less. Sure you have some time between films, but usually management finds more jobs for to do.\nI also often helped behind the snacks counter or had to clean the seats and alleys after a screening.",1232229922

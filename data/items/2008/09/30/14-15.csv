Right?  select/etc... are a great way of whipping out static content, but if you have to stop to do some processing, you're going to lock things, unless you then spawn a thread, process, or something else to do concurrent work.

319590,comment,319337,319337,0,0,snorkel,,,"Interesting series. Here's a different approach to code parsing which some people may find easier using Top Down Order Precedence:<p><a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html</a><p>The example explained on that page by Douglas Crockford (Yahoo's Javascript guru) is a TDOP parser written in Javascript thats parses Javascript (it's a concept demo, not a practical use case) What's nice about his example is he covers lots of different features like scope, functions, and objects, which are sometimes glossed over in other texts about how compilers work. This is not a complete compiler because it only produces a syntax tree, but going from syntax tree to interpreter/compiler is the easier part.",1222785730
319589,comment,319314,319503,0,0,baltoo,,,"Isn't a fundamental problem that form is function? With that I mean that in the end the form of the UI is part of it's function. So are other parts, e.g. ""content"" is part of the UI's function as well.<p>This would imply that there's no true dichtomy between logic and presentation as such, but rather different types of functionality. Just as there are very seldom any bulk-heads between different types of a whole's functionality in general, I think it would be impossible to truly separate logic and presentation. (Not that some separation cannot go a long way.)<p>In the end we cannot escape presentation at any stage of the design of a system. If not anything else we have an internal presentation for the internal representation of the external problem. This alone makes us design things assuming much about the form. Is there even such a thing as representation without presentation? With that I again mean that presentation is a fundamental and non-separable part of any thing we handle.<p>I'm sorry if this comes across as mumbling. I've troubles expressing these thoughts clearly. Guess I don't understand them well enough..",1222785706

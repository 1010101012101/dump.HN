I was a bit shocked to login and find 14,000 views to our website today, and that a lot of them came from here!  Thanks to all of you for your support.  I figured I'd clear up a couple of points while I'm here.<p>1. The noPhoto does react more than fast enough.  The shutter speed of the red light camera is actually irrelevant when dealing with optical slave triggers, technology which has been used in the photography world for a long time.<p>2.  The noPhoto does defeat multiple pictures at once, and it does work in the daytime.  I can't post a link here, but if you go to our youtube channel you can see a video we shot to show it working under a few different conditions.<p>3.  Most studies that are not funded by the red light camera companies show that these cameras actually increase both overall accidents as well as injury-causing accidents.<p>4.  We do not support running red lights intentionally.  The noPhoto is not meant to enable irresponsible drivers to blow through intersections with impunity - rather, the hope is that by installing a noPhoto, drivers will drive as they did before the dangerous red light cameras were installed.<p>If there's any other questions you have, feel free to ask.  Thanks!",1350705399

For example - do I get more radiation from an open window?  Do they make window screens that can block radiation?  Is there any research into reducing radiation exposure while flying?  In much the same way we take a risk while driving, but now have Air Bags, ABS Breaks, tempered glass, break away wheel columns, etc... - I'm wondering if we're putting the same effort into the radiation risk while flying.<p>I just never heard much about it until the TSA added the backscatter machines.",1350702763
4676257,comment,4675167,4675383,3,0,gizmo686,,,"I think it is also important to remember that iOS (and similar devices) have a much stronger security model from a technical standpoint (low-level, near complete sandboxing with white-listed permisions). As apposed to most desktop computers where almost every program runs with full user permisions, and in the case of windows 95 (and maybe also XP), that normal user tended to be an administrator.<p>I don't really think most computer sophisticates have a problem with a walled garden, but rather a problem with a locked down garden. In linux, for example, the standard means of installing software is through a central repository maintained by whoever maintains the OS, and all of the software in that repository is reviewed before being added. The difference is that if the user wants to, they can install software not offered through the repository, and/or add 3rd party repositories.",1350702762

What I am really hoping to build is an app that users can connect over their friends with.\nI guess there are two reasons for social integration: promotion, which involves broadcasting the users participation to his circles (and I care less for that), but the other is engagement (come back to the app because the users friends did something interesting there). Games like Draw Something or Words With Friends for example are fun even when you aren;t tweeting actions to the non-participating audience. But its a lot less fun if its just a game you play with the computer itself.",1350702558

4676250,comment,4675857,4675857,7,0,YZF,,,"Hear hear.  I've been saying a similar thing for a long time.<p>If the business is so great why sell?  The act of selling implies you think it's worth less than what someone else is willing to pay which is dishonest.  If you thought it was worth more you wouldn't sell (under most situations, there are always exceptions).<p>Why shouldn't a VC hold on to the great business they've built for the sake of future cash flow?  A great business should be able to get funding.<p>It also drives the wrong behavior.  Instead of building a real business that lasts better build the appearance of a business that will fetch a good price.  Such and such multiple of sales (what about profit? future cash flow?).  Such and such many users (who may never pay you a cent).  This behavior doesn't stop at the first exit, it perpetuates throughout the lifetime of many public companies; focus on looking good rather than being good.<p>I always thought the original purpose of the stock market was for companies to raise money to go after bigger things- it seems the purpose today is to ""exit"".<p>EDIT with another thought:\nTo me, build a business vs. build an exit strategy should be orthogonal to VC vs. bootstrap.  You can bootstrap and work towards an IPO and you should be able to VC without selling the business.  I think everyone would benefit from a frame of mind that is about building successful, sustainable, long lasting businesses.",1350702471

4676243,comment,4675857,4675857,7,0,blacksmythe,,,"Although I am not going to fault the conclusion, there are a number of questionable assumptions in this analysis.<p>One is that the expected value of an effort is not the probability of trying times the expected value of succeeding.\nMultiplying by 1% since only 1% of companies raise VC funds is not relevant. The correct proportion should be the percentage of companies that try to raise VC funds which are successful. Say this is 10%.<p>Two is that you are not going to spend the 10 years used for comparison trying and failing to raise VC funding. After 6 months you should give up, and spend the next 9.5 years trying to build a small business (expected value = (90% chance of failing to raise VC funding) * (9.5years/10years)* $356.4k ~ $305k).<p>Three is that the expected value of an exit is not the probability of a minimum exit cutoff times that exit value. There is a power law distribution to success, so the expected value of an exit is much higher than $100M * 2%. I'll be lazy and guess that the expected value is 3x higher due to the power law distribution of success (I imagine 3x is grossly underestimating here).<p>This makes the expected value of the VC success $3.3k * 10x * 3x ($100k) + the expected value that you give up on VC funding and start a small business ($305k), or approximately $405k. Not nearly so obvious a choice as painted in this blog post.",1350702172

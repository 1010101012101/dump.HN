Even in my little dorm room I didn&#x27;t feel cramped and I definitely got along with my roommates in most cases. But there are so many tangible benefits to living on your own.<p>- Personal hygiene: my roommate wasn&#x27;t the cleanup. In fact, the only time he got into it was when he had company (a girl) coming over.<p>- Personal finance: I was able to get the landlord to split the rental but this was not the case for heat, electricity, cable, and internet.<p>- Personal space: We were both guilty of this. Our girlfriends, unofficially, moved in at some points. Normally, not a problem but if you&#x27;ve ever had to wash your face in the kitchen sink because the bathroom was occupied for hours sometimes.<p>Sometimes you have to pullback and focus. If you are constantly surrounded by the same faces it can be easy to do &quot;work&quot; without actually doing anything productive.",1395313129

But I think it&#x27;s significant that he does not loose hope altogether:<p>&quot;There is nothing better for a man [than] that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor.&quot;<p>So the philosophy of Ecclesiastes is almost hedonistic (and views god more as blind fate than a benevolent force or being).",1395312982

If your formal definition results in agents that never do anything, or are in basic conflicts with millions of years of evolution and survival, then it&#x27;s far more likely the formal definition is wrong, or your understanding of it is wrong, and not humans.<p>I understand the benefits of strict formal rational analysis. You can reason about it. But then if you&#x27;ll talk about that, don&#x27;t compare it to intelligence. Strict rationality is not intelligent. It&#x27;s a tool we&#x27;ve made ourselves that has specific strengths and weaknesses born out of its restrictions.<p>And strict rationality is absolutely dependent on the model you apply it on. Wrong model + perfect rationality = disastrous decision. No one talks about the models, ever, it seems.<p>This is the real problem with AI - that we try to implement our very rough (at this point of time) idea of what intelligence is. If we knew all the details of animal/human intelligence, we wouldn&#x27;t be sitting here debating it, we would&#x27;ve just implemented the AI with it.",1395312976

Commenting guidelines are already weird (I got pummeled for that one, even though I was the only one trying to explain the relevance for HN on the entire thread, and ask the community non-obvious questions) but I though starting by clarifying posting ones: is it neglected technical aspects, social issues, things that a world-changing company can make profit from?<p>In this case, the only solution that I see is automated construction using 3D-printing, most likely augmented by drones to scale. That would put most of those workers out of a job -- a situation probably worst off, and more deadly than the one they are in at the moment. It follows the disenfranching trend that Brynjolfsson gives to technology, and against yesterday’s parallel example (locally made menstruating pads in rural India).<p>I assumed talking about that was better that the tacitly racist ‘You know, Qatari have no respect for human lives…’ that fill this thread otherwise. It might sound true (family members living there tend to agree, vocally, but they aren’t exactly not-racists) but it seems far less productive than highlighting the works of some Qatari trying to change that.",1395312353

As it disintegrates, the plastic ultimately becomes small enough to be ingested by aquatic organisms that reside near the ocean&#x27;s surface.

We all agree that traditional working environments with all their industrial era baggage sucks, but if I don&#x27;t leave on the minute after a 40 hours work week, and I don&#x27;t get paid overtime (so much for the industrial era baggage) it&#x27;s incontrovertible evidence of rampant exploitation. Employees to claim to like their workplaces are brainwashed because the only reason you like your workplace is if you drank the koolaid - and of course hating your job is evidence of incompetent management. Remote work is the thing of the future, except companies that provide for easy remote working are under deep suspicion for tricking their employees to work during their free time.<p>HN is really, really schizophrenic on work. The middlebrow is strong with this one.",1395310120

We&#x27;ve all seen it here on HN: Some article gets linked to, the server goes down, and people are forced to see the article on the Google cache.<p>So my point is this: Why not instead go for a database that was actually made to handle these kinds of situations? True, using PostgreSQL or MySQL won&#x27;t in itself ensure that you&#x27;ll survive a slashdotting/HN&#x27;ing, but your chances are better.

So either you have to serve it up yourself or you have to put it on your own CDN (either one you run yourself or a managed one).<p>So you have an additional point of failure (because your static files are coming from at least two places rather than one) which multiplies the chances of something going wrong for little benefit in my opinion.<p>Deployments are likely to be much more complex too, etc.<p>And before someone mentions the limit of how many concurrent requests a browser will make to a host: That&#x27;s also irrelevant. I&#x27;m not arguing that you should have loads of little files. You should still be combining things with build tools. In fact if you host those &quot;vendor&quot; files on your own webserver or cdn you actually have more flexibility around how to combine them.

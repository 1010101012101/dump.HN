334782,comment,334355,334518,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Intuitively that makes sense but I'm not sure if it's actually true. It's relatively easy to convince someone who would otherwise go into hedge funds to instead do a web startup with you. It's much more difficult, however, to convince that person to do a startup to the field of, say, ethnic pharmacology. That doesn't mean the hedge fund guy would necessarily make a bad partner for a web startup though. (Stereotypes about finance people aside.)<p>Also, I know pg says that not being able to find a cofounder after a certain point signals a lack of competence or a bad idea, which is generally of correct, but also realize that in some areas finding a cofounder is literally 10x harder than in others-- independent of the merits of the founder or the idea.",1224183156

It was hemorrhaging cash like Pac Man Jones & Robert Downey Jr. trapped in a strip club.<p>-Flickr was _priced_ like a talent acquisition.<p>-Like most acquisitions, the Myspace acquisition has largely failed according to Google, their primary advertiser. Additionally, Myspace's contribution to News Corp's earnings have been piss poor.<p>I agree that it's a valid strategy (especially for a company like Justin.TV), but IMHO opinion most companies have tunnel vision when it comes to turning in to a real business. It almost makes them risk seeking. Although getting acquired is nice, it sure as hell isn't a strategy - it's a cop out.<p>I'm trying to come up with companies that tried this strategy and either worked (issued dividends continuously) or was acquired and actually benefited (i.e. was worth their acquisition price based on DCF) their acquiring company.

Facebook for instance enforces that you enter a valid email address to belong to a network (e.g. Cornell University etc).

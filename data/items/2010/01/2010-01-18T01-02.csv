No one seems to complain about this except the spammers. I think that is great customer service, except that Google recently needs to do more of that. That too is not censorship.

1059211,story,,,7,8,olliesaunders,"Ask HN: Is Google's Go ready for serious projects?",,"I've spent the last few weeks re-learning C to write a simple server for my startup. The last time I wrote any C, I was in college and had only just finished ""Learning to Program with Pascal"". Re-approaching it as a more experienced programmer—and one used to newer, more dynamic languages, at that—I've found it pretty frustrating.<p>C has frustrated me not because more lines are required to get things done, or because malloc'd memory must be freed. (I understand what kind of language C is and what it is designed to do). I'm frustrated by the inherent problems of macros and the constraining nature of static typing. I think my frustrations are best summed up by this thought experiment: Imagine the only pre-processor directive was #include; with no #define or #if etc. What would C be like?<p>My take has been that a lot of what makes C so simple, and effective at achieving it's noble but relatively humble goals, also causes it to be greatly constraining. I think this is why the C pre-processor was introduced. The pre-processor attempts to tackle problems of excessive constraint. It sort of solves them (kinda), but also introduces a whole load of new ones.<p>In my most recent attempt, I'm using a couple of macros to generate readers and writers (of files) of a bunch of number types that my server uses. I'm pretty pleased with the results, but feel like I just pulled a big hack. (I can already picture the hardass purists on ##c telling me off for doing it). And I noticed what I was doing reminded me of Haskell typeclasses.<p>Another problem for me—a controversial problem, seeing as you have these in C++ and Objective-C as well—is header files. I really hate having to write those. I hate having to wrap them in #ifndefs and the decisions of where other header #includes should go. I can't help thinking ""Why can't these be generated? Or inferred? And why do I have to write /almost/ the same thing again?"".<p>In response to all this, I decided to watch that hour-long talk on Go again. I had good intentions; I was looking for ideas to better my C programming. But instead, perhaps unsurprisingly, it showed me more places where C was less-than-great; the shortcomings of the C const keyword were mentioned, as was the silliness of typed constants. That talk increased my frustration with C, and now I'm considering using Go to write my server.<p>What does using Go mean for me? I'll be able to use channels (whatever they are) and concurrency will be a lot easier (a problem I had chosen to—<i>cough</i>—defer, whilst I was working with C). It also looks like that typeclass-thing I was using macros for is formally emboddied by Go's ""interfaces"". This all sounds great but there's a concern: Go is a very new language. In a brief session on #go-nuts, I exchanged with someone trying out Go's regular expressions. We concluded that there was quite a glaring bug in the regular expression parser, which is slightly alarming although perhaps not surprising.<p>So, you're about up to date now, and I ask: Has anyone on HN tried Go? What do you think? Is it too new or buggy for a serious project? I am a lone developer and I'm prepared to be experimental, but it's important that this server be reliable.<p>(I have already considered Erlang for this project but decided it wouldn't give me the low-level control I wanted, and dismissed Haskell for the same reason; I'm steering clear of C++ for all the reasons previously discussed on HN; Objective-C seems to compete more directly with Go but it's still a superset of C, so I imagine it suffers from similar problems).<p>Thanks for reading.",1263776692

Microsoft in large part ""won"" by default, too many of its competitors lost that ability (and many would say Microsoft started losing it with Longhorn).<p>Let me explore this a bit more: I say that there's something fundamentally different between the middle two companies/areas you cite and Oracle's with databases.  Oracle has a <i>large</i> core of code <i>it</i> has to keep working.  If Sun went poof, the Java ecosystem would continue without much pause.  If/when Yahoo goes poof, will anyone significantly outside of it <i>really</i> care?<p>(I don't know enough about PhotoShop to comment on it, and while it's non-trivial to become a big search engine, enough companies continue to try at something like Google's scale (e.g. Yahoo, Microsoft ... and look at Wowd for a disruptive attack on the problem) that I'm not too worried as of yet.  Ah: PhotoShop is a sticky application, switching to another vendor is expensive, search is not.  Advertising is in between.)<p>I think it's more than new markets.  E.g. Java was aimed at one new market (appliances), released for another (web browsers), but ended up being wildly successful in the second oldest (data processing; only number crunching is older ... and Sun is addressing that with Fortress in the Java ecosystem).<p>Search was not a new market when Google appeared on the scene, e.g. it replaced AltaVista for me.  This is a field where creative destruction can renew a sector instead of just replacing it.",1263776517

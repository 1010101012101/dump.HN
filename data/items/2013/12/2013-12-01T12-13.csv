It is very obvious to me (imho) that Vermeer&#x27;s works is of a wholly different character than any other Dutch masters working at the time. His paintings are incredibly flat and tonal, and very, very photographic.<p>I also think that his compositions are his true genius. His compositions are beyond masterful. They are brilliant. This is hard to describe to a non-artist, but the way that he uses tight negative spacing along with his use of large spacious gradations is magic. He had the eye of a master photographer. This is where the question comes in for me. Did he set up his scenes and then limit himself to what he was able to manage there, just tracing what he saw? Or did he allow himself the freedom to change and modify the spaces and proportions to what looked right to him. I personally believe the latter.<p>To me, Vermeer is one of the greatest photographers thats ever lived. Every 2D design class should devote long study to his compositions.",1385902530

6827067,comment,6823925,6826524,1,0,Udo,,,"In responding to this, I&#x27;m assuming your comment <i>isn&#x27;t</i> politically motivated. That assumption might be wrong, in which case the following points will be for naught:<p><i>> 1st assumption: It is within human reach to change the climate.</i><p>There is nothing in principle to prevent us from affecting any kind of change on any kind of scale. The planet is a system that doesn&#x27;t care who is affecting the variables, it&#x27;s not as if there is some kind of cosmic firewall making sure we humans don&#x27;t overstep our boundaries. We already affected the planet in a myriad ways, so it&#x27;s difficult to make a rational argument that we can&#x27;t. If your objection to this is on supernatural grounds, there is not a lot I can do to address that. But if it&#x27;s not, just look at the true scale at which we&#x27;re doing things here.<p><i>> 2nd: Current climate variations are created by human activities.</i><p>That is a good point worth looking into. The way to examine this is to look at known factors that influence the global climate. The best-known one are greenhouse gases. It&#x27;s no question that a lot of them are produced naturally and that there are (even extreme) natural cycles to these things. On the other hand, however, we can estimate our own output reasonably well, so it becomes a matter of math. The rational consensus is that a non-trivial amount of greenhouse gases is emitted by human activities.<p><i>> 3rd: A human induced climate change will make the planet warmer.</i><p>The planet doesn&#x27;t care who induced what. Overall, the planet will get warmer, yes. Because it&#x27;s a complex system, that means in some regions it&#x27;s going to get <i>a lot colder</i> than  today.<p><i>> 4th: A warmer planet is bad. (If you look at a world map, you&#x27;ll see huge surface of land in the temperate and frigid zones.)</i><p>I think a huge misunderstanding here is that people think it&#x27;s bad for the planet. Again, the planet doesn&#x27;t care, and the ecosystem has certainly seen worse changes historically. The planet and life as a whole are going to be just fine! Humans, on the other hand, not so much.<p>Here are some examples of things that are going to hurt us, and each of these drags behind it a long tail of consequences. Most equatorial regions will become warmer, dramatically increasing the deserts (and in some places creating new ones). A lot of people live in these zones. Other regions will see drastically more powerful storms and floods. The oceans will rise and make many sea-adjacent cities untenable. You mentioned temperate and frigid zones, I live in one of them. Where I live, the gulf stream will cease to transport heat into my climate zone, causing an ice age. It&#x27;s going to get very uncomfortable for a lot of people, and by uncomfortable I mean deadly.<p>You question a lot whether human can and do influence climate change. Of course they do, but on the whole that&#x27;s only partially relevant. The only reason why were interested in finding out our role in the change is so we have <i>more options</i> in counteracting the phenomenon.",1385902117

6827053,comment,6823973,6824871,1,0,VLM,,,"Linear and Intersil make COTS support chips.  From a power supply design perspective it makes some interesting ideas possible, because you can turn a bridge rectifier on and off as fast as you want this way.  So you can make a super low frequency switching power supply using the rectifier itself as the switch.<p>There are two obvious problems.  First the voltage regulation is garbage because you&#x27;re running 60 Hz instead of a typical switcher in the KHz region, so you&#x27;ll be investing heavily in large filter capacitors or you&#x27;ll have awful ripple on the output.  Maybe it would make a good battery charger instead of using perfect regulated 5 volt USB power as typical?  The other obvious problem is you can use four cheap diodes and one switching transistor on one heat sink, or four switching transistors on four heatsinks and probably a very small diode bridge to provide power to the chip to run the works (although maybe controllers have on chip rectifiers)  And the cost at reasonable power levels of a switcher is a rounding error compared to its heatsink and the effort / labor of mounting it on a heatsink.  So unless you&#x27;d doing some crazy electrochemical refining type stuff you&#x27;d probably not use a synch rectifier, just not economical.

If you take more than a second to think about that claim (it&#x27;s not even necessary to look at other languages...), you&#x27;ll quickly notice that &quot;my&quot; does nothing of the kind; it denotes some sort of relationship (of almost any kind) between you and the specified noun.

What I have is the ability to enjoy my life tenfold more than I could before I came to understand how I think, and how to get along with others, insofar as I have. I can answer your question for my particular case, but the process itself is not easily repeatable.<p>What I learned from a passing interest in social psychology and repeated examination of significant events in my life gradually imparted an awareness of why some difficulties kept recurring, and also something of an understanding of what brought me to each point along the way. It helped that a close friend was a counselor, who shared with me experiences she had with autistic clients. This was important for providing an objective contrast of the conclusions humans would reach in different situations. I never knew anything I shouldn&#x27;t, regarding the specifics of an individual or who they were, but I learned enough to gain a certain perspective on how we ASD thinkers tend to think, and what that often overlooks.<p>Thus the short, useless answer is: by thinking. Funny thing is, I have so little interest in contemplation and reflection, it&#x27;s amazing I&#x27;ve ever accomplished anything with them.<p>To me the important thing is a perspective that can only be imparted by experience or a like minded thinker. This is why I believe it is crucially important for me to raise my own biological children. By understanding where they are as they develop, I will be able to guide them in ways I needed by never had. What I know about how other ASD individuals think is incidental.

6827021,comment,6826819,6826881,3,0,thaumasiotes,,,"In Chinese, pronouns are not distinguished by gender; the third-person pronoun is 他[ta].  In modern written Chinese, however, they are spelled differently by gender.  At some point in the recent past, some person of authority innovated the characters 她 and 它 (both, obviously, pronounced ta) to refer to females and nonhumans, in order to more easily translate European literature into Chinese.  For whatever reason, they are now considered standard spelling.  The twist is that it turns out to be useful sometimes to use gender-neutral language, so when a chinese text is specifically trying to be gender-neutral, instead of using 他, it will often use &quot;TA&quot; (the actual roman characters).  I can&#x27;t help but feel that it&#x27;s a long, pointless rigmarole to go through in order to arrive where you started from.<p>(There&#x27;s also a character 妳, the female equivalent of the second-person pronoun 你, but owing to the inscrutable whims of politics it hasn&#x27;t caught on in the mainland.)",1385900823

BTW HN itself works great without JavaScript.<p>To your point about &quot;uninitialized variable&quot; nets, if the net was truly a singleton it would show up as such in a netlist report. This capability existed in board design tools I used 30 years ago. What might have happened is a renamed net might have been split into two different nets. E.g. a net that connected 10 places became two nets, one to 8 places, another to 2 places. Not a singleton.<p>There are additional checks that netlist generation tools can do. E.g. does every net have a &quot;driver&quot; or &quot;output&quot; on it, or does it consist of all &quot;inputs&quot;. Absence of driver can easily be flagged as an error. However, there is one wrinkle. Sometimes, nets are &quot;busses&quot; and are bidirectional. Each pin of the net can be either an input or an output at various times. That&#x27;s harder to detect as an error.<p>There are many ways to avoid problems like this. Two common ones:\n1) READ THE LOGS. I&#x27;d bet even money that your problem shows up in the logs as a singleton net or as a net without a driver.\n2) SIMULATE. Board functional simulation has been possible for over 30 years; it&#x27;s not always done. Did your engineer simulate his design? Why didn&#x27;t his simulation catch the problem?<p>Sometimes, in board design (as in FPGA design) it&#x27;s faster and certainly easier to just get 99% of the way there ahead of time and debug the final few errors on the board itself. That might be the case here, so if your company made this decision a priori, then you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if you need to spend some time debugging a few simple errors.<p>BTW that sort of sloppiness just wouldn&#x27;t fly in chip design. Chips are usually far far far too complicated; extensive pre-tapeout simulation is de rigueur. And it takes weeks (if you have much money and a very good relationship with a fab) or months to get revised silicon. Much easier to do a few cuts and jumpers to a board than to do a silicon spin.<p>As to &quot;refactoring support&quot;, most CAD systems I was familiar with didn&#x27;t have an easy way to rename a net across multiple &quot;pages&quot; of a board design. Maybe the tools have gotten better. IMO that sort of refactoring (if done extensively) is a losing proposition anyway. You&#x27;re much better off with careful attention to detail up front. You should be very careful renaming nets that cross schematic pages; you wouldn&#x27;t have the problem if you carefully thought about the names before you created the schematic.<p>In summary, even the best tools won&#x27;t help a sloppy designer.",1385900808

It used to be that it was easier to build on top of existing structures - or the remains thereof - rather than cart the trash out and start fresh.<p>If you ever go to Rome, you&#x27;ll notice that the Colosseum, for example, is at surface level, but most of the land around it is raised up.  During street work, you can see parts where they&#x27;ve uncovered foundations, often digging down quite a ways to get to what was the street level at the time.  In a place like Rome, when they uncover new ruins, they&#x27;ll generally be studied for a while and then covered back up because it&#x27;s the easiest way to preserve the site because they still need the land above it to be usable.",1385899274

6487835,comment,6487665,6487776,6,0,ostrakon,,,"If a couple produces 50 zygotes togather, and the mother and father test all of them, and pick the one that sounds like it has the most appealing traits that a couple might envision together, and discard the rest, would that count as &quot;design&quot;?<p>This process sounds like it&#x27;s half a step away from that. The half-step being that they only mention testing the parents, and then the process permits a degree of  hypothesizing about possible children. Meanwhile, how hard would it be to test an embryo in utero, and then make a shallow, superficial decision about the pregnancy?<p>The process is practical and ethical, when considering it&#x27;s utility for assessing the risk of inherited, incurable diseases tied to varying combinations of dominant or recessive genes, but it&#x27;s a flimsy assumption that it will solely be used for only those scenarios.<p>There will be couples with known risk factors, who will want to roll the dice and try anyway, because they love eachother and want a family, and then they check their pregnancy in utero for things like downs syndrome. But then, if you have the options in front of you, why not check out other characteristics too?<p>And then, if couple A was allowed to do that, and this is a business, after all... Why not couple B? This couple who has no life threatening conditions or genetic combinations, but has the money, and the confidentialitiy of protected health information laws shrouding their decisions in secrecy.<p>In 20 years, don&#x27;t be surprised when a certain cross-section of humanity suddenly looks strikingly different, but without any obvious explanation.",1380790683

6487819,comment,6487661,6487798,6,0,Jd,,,"This has been a long standing problem of my own. I think finding a true co-founder if you don&#x27;t already have someone immediately present in your pool is extraordinarily difficult. The sub-optimal thing is especially difficult if you&#x27;ve already started (I&#x27;m 8 months in myself), and then it doesn&#x27;t make sense to divide equity equally any more either, so you effectively end up with a &quot;first employee&quot; rather than a true co-founder.<p>I don&#x27;t have an obvious solution to this problem.  Looks like pushing forward alone (w/ a few odd employees) is the most likely option.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not immediately clear to me that I would have been better off with a co-founder. There are so many value and design decisions to make early on that need to be established, and being able to make those fairly quickly and push forward with the bulk of the effort (first development, now sales) I think was a good position to be in.<p>That said, it is considerably easier to get in a funk as a single founder working longer hours than anyone else, constantly pushing forward without any discernible support. Having a girlfriend helped me with part of this for awhile -- although I had somewhat minimized working hours because of her, I also avoided any major &quot;slump&quot; periods.<p>Also, tracking all progress (lines of code written, tickets closed, commits, user adoption) has been great since I have weekly metrics that I&#x27;m always seeking to achieve. I think that&#x27;s been the best way to keep me focused, and also to direct my focus at the most important goal at any given moment.<p>Also I still have lots of equity to give away -- if anyone reading this wants any, please let me know ;)",1380790238

(And I love this kind of debate.)<p>So I&#x27;ll accept both premises.  And for premise 1, let&#x27;s imagine the system we use to quantify beauty measures pronouncement of cheekbones and thickness of lips, etc.  Premise 2 remains untouched.  Here&#x27;s the problem:  Angelina Jolie would score well, but so would Jocelyn Wildenstein (Google image search that), and Emma Watson would score poorly. We would come to wrong individual conclusions based on correlations made from larger sample sizes.  In fact, Jocelyn Wildenstein might come away with the title of &quot;the most beautiful person ever.&quot;  (And if you think I&#x27;m joking, listen to any interview with a man named Chris Langan.)<p>Since intelligence is qualitative, like beauty or flavors of ice cream, it&#x27;s about the mix of ingredients.  It&#x27;s about &quot;character&quot;.  So that while you can make good correlations on large sample sizes, it&#x27;s that individual mix that defines &quot;beauty&quot;, &quot;tasty&quot;, etc.  Alan Kay was wrong: point of view isn&#x27;t worth 80 IQ points -- 80 IQ points is worth a better point of view.  That point of view is the end result, the character that determines your intelligence.<p>Again, the most beautiful woman, say, may not have the combined biggest lips and highest cheekbones, but an especially good mix.  If you look at Einstein and every other great thinker, the people we consider the smartest, they won&#x27;t have the highest IQ scores, but they had the best intellectual character.",1380789681

If they hire disreputable lawyers, catch those lawyers on using funds for something other than legal expenses and disbar them for it.

This is an example of the birthday paradox[1].<p>With 2^512 possible keys (~10^154) even if everyone on earth (~10^9 people) got a billion new IDs every second (~10^18 per person per year) it would be more than a hundred thousand billion billion billion billion billion years (~10^50 year) before there was an even chance of a single ID collision (~10^77 IDs => 50% chance of 1 collision). So I think we can safely assume there will not be a collision.<p>In fact it is almost always the case in cryptography that there will be some risk of failure but as long as that risk is very small the system is considered secure. This is way way way beyond the normal standards of security (say 10^30 or so).<p>Many of your other points are a matter of opinion. There will be always tradeoffs between usability and security.

So you have machines which work over a protocol (FIX) to establish the price mechanism. In a exchange system there are limit orders and the limit orderbook. You basically have a timestamp problem, which is kind of prependicular to the bitcoin system. At every point t in time, there is a fair value of BTC-USD. And a system which solves that problem will be highly centralized, by definition. So unless you come up with a new system for processing limit orders, people will be arbitraging between a slower system and MtGox, Bitstamp, etc.",1380787520

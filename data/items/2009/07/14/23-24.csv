Before knowing about this test, it possibly made me a little less inclined to like/trust you than otherwise. (I think it did, but I don't know how to measure that.)<p>I wonder if that's a common reaction: maybe there's an uncanny valley-type effect, where more efficient phrasings become turnoffs?

E.g, your first point, the painful status quo. My previous company addressed the job search market, in which most people are very unhappy with the status quo solutions; and our particular solution, I feel, was about 40-70% better than existing ones (and also a new paradigm), nonetheless, people weren't really readily jumping ship.

They're taking as much risk, if not more, and they're getting short changed on reward.<p>He's probably thinking big exit, say $100M, and doesn't see why you should get $25-50M.  However, the likely best case result is a $5-10M exit.  If you're putting in a couple of years, $1M is absurd.  (Note that the typical result is a $0 exit.)<p>If he's fixated on the big score, he might agree to something like you get 50% of the first $5M and 10% after that.  That shifts the risk back to him.  If he's the genius that he thinks that he is, that's basically the same as a 10% deal.

You could tell a computer which ingredients are expensive, which are likely to be unnecessary, and which can be substituted.

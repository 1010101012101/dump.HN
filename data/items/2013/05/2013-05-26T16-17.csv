Where to, and how often? Are we just duplicating every so often or do we want snapshots at certain periods that we can revert to?<p>* How do we deal with software failures, like FS corruption?<p>* How do we update our software stack, when do we update it and how do we test that an update hasn't broken anything?<p>* What about if we want to concurrently run 2 versions of the same framework for different apps?<p>* How can we configure firewalling etc to allow trusted people to connect to the database, but block the people who spam the login form every 5 seconds?<p>* How do we make sure the software is configured correctly? Like charset encodings in the database, making sure that we have the correct modules installed into apache/php or the right gems installed etc?<p>* How do we manage background tasks, like cronjobs etc?<p>* How do we manage alerts when things fall over? Nagios etc.<p>A lot of the answers to these are going to depend on specific requirements for the project so are going to require some ops know-how to set up correctly. Or is it more the case that a cloud provider gives you a specific set up with limited options and you make everything fit around that?<p>Or is there some magic that goes on which I am missing?",1369587555

Right now we are in the region where this is just borderline feasible, but in five years I'm pretty sure it will seem like a no-brainer.

5771571,comment,5771382,5771382,5,0,mythz,,,"A good example of bloatware encouraged by a non-expressive language. Instead of adding a language feature that makes constructing any instance easier, in 2013 they're adding support for a builder on a single Calendar class.<p><pre><code>    final Calendar calendar =  
       new Calendar.Builder()  
         .set(YEAR, 2013)  
         .set(MONTH, APRIL)  
         .set(DATE, 6)  
         .build(); 
</code></pre>
For a similar API in C# you could use named parameters:<p><pre><code>   var calendar = new Calendar(year:2013, month:Month.April, date:6);
</code></pre>
or just set public properties in an object initializer:<p><pre><code>    var calendar = new Calendar { 
      Year = 2013,
      Month = Month.April,
      Date = 6,
    };
</code></pre>
Likewise in Dart with named parameters:<p><pre><code>   var calendar = new Calendar(year:2013, month:APRIL, date:6);
</code></pre>
or using method cascades:<p><pre><code>    var calendar = new Calendar()
      ..year = 2013
      ..month = APRIL
      ..date = 6;

Not the best but better with it.<p>That super cool coffee house that only employs art majors?  you need to notice that none of the baristas are over 30.<p>In all seriousness, you are talking about middle management, and in that case, yeah, you've got a point.  Class markers matter very little as an individual contributor in this industry.  They matter more and more as you move into sales and middle-management.    (what I find interesting is that it seems to matter /less/ when you are the actual owner.   Class markers are important for impressing people when you have no actual power, but if it's your company?  you can show up in a 10 year old minivan, and you are just being smart with your money.)<p>That is the thing;  The degree is breaking down as a class marker.   (that, and if you are American, I'd not put all that much stock in non-monetary class-markers to begin with.  Unlike Europeans, to us?  class is all about the money.)<p>Or, rather; the degree from a mediocre school is breaking down as a class marker. To be clear, if you are talking about a degree from Yale, I completely agree with you.  If you have a chance to get a degree from yale, get it.   I'm talking about the rest of us who have a choice between a job and a degree from a mediocre school.   If you show up with a degree from po-dunk state and I show up with no degree?  we're going to compete on our merits.   (If you show up with a degree from University of Phoenix, as far as class markers go?  I'm going to have the edge.)<p>>I completely disagree. You can work for Google and in fifteen years they go bankrupt because Infinootle is using a new hyperrank technique and they employ robots instead of humans. Then you remember that Google was a colossus on the early XXI century.<p>you have several issues here.  First, if you can't get another job when your current company goes under?  you have a huge problem.  Huge.   You need to focus on keeping yourself employable within your industry/job role.  If that industry/job role goes away, you need to switch.   But google going out of business?  None of the people I know working at google have skillsets that will become obsolete if search and search advertising go away as important businesses.   Programming is... pretty generalizable;  many of the googlers I know were programming and solving interesting problems before google made that business model a big deal.<p>Having big names on your resume is great.  But you can't rely on that to get you your next job... how many of us have hired someone who used to work at google on the strength of the google experience, and found the results disappointing?   I have.  (actually the person was a contractor, handling internal helpdesk stuff, but I was hiring for a helpdesk type role, so it seemed a reasonable match.  It wasn't.)<p>Next?  automation.  Competing with machines is something we all will have to do, degree or no.   As a SysAdmin, I've seen tools come out that can make handling larger fleets with fewer people significantly easier;  but I've also seen fleets get significantly larger.  Some would call ""the cloud"" an 'existential threat' to my job role, but cloud providers being what they are... this does not seem to be the case.<p>And programming languages are doing the same thing; you can do a lot more with less programming skill than you could 10 years ago.<p>(I think automating away programming has an additional problem;  most people can't clearly define what they want done in prose.   If anything, it's usually easier to clearly specify exactly what you want in code than in prose, even if you are semi-literate.  So half the programming job is going from vague requirements to an implementation that works.  This, I think, is why we are seeing a diminishing return on 'easier' programming languages... at some level, someone along the chain needs to understand what the hell they are asking for, and nice GUIs don't make that requirement go away.)<p>The thing is?  the best (and perhaps only) weapon that we the meatbags have against the machines is our flexibility.    The people who have to be shown how to do a job before they can do it?  those people have already lost the battle.  they are already unemployed.   So training?   a whole hell of a lot less valuable than it was back when you could do the same thing day in and day out.<p>If you want to stay employed?  you need to be able to figure out how to solve the problems that the robots haven't  been programmed to solve yet.   This is a fast-moving target, and while school can give you a larger toolbox, from what I've seen, it leaves people with this laughable expectation that they will be trained to do the job that they are required to do.",1369586282

The only local divergences are the changes you haven't committed yet.

There is local working copy state. There is local repository state. There is remote repository state. There is other people's remote repository state.

It's like going to a party and discussing the merits of the Death Star, I'm sure there are wikipedia pages that could answer all questions but sometimes people enjoy debating something.<p>* Arguments should be embraced, and hidden.

I have been using Clojure professionally for several years and I still feel like a Rookie. I have a mentoring job right now getting a very bright guy up to speed on both Clojure and the semantic web for his projects. He has a long hill to climb with Clojure but he is motivated and I think it will change his life as a developer in a good way.<p>I little off topic, but I know that Clojure is not the perfect language for me because I keep looking for better languages. I have been experimenting hard with DART in the last week and DART has the same nice ""one language on client and server"" feature that Clojure + Clojurescript provide. DART may or may not have a great future, but worth keeping an eye on. Also on some days, I feel like going back to Common Lisp or Smalltalk, but that is just crazy thinking :-)",1369584181

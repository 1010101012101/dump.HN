1246670,comment,1246395,1246652,0,0,mike_organon,,,"The article does not describe Objectivism, only refers the reader to look there for a rational ethics. Objectivism is not ""ought to do what we want to do"", that would again be ethics based on feelings, but instead of arriving at altruism as the New Atheists do, you arrived at something like hedonism.  And that is the point: feelings are not a means of knowledge - everyone will arrive at something different.  Feelings don't help you understand biological evolution, nor morality.",1270623443

Instead, it's showing that the morality these New Atheists present is no more grounded in reason than religion is - they ground it in feelings.  The alternative is Objectivism which bases morality on facts and reason.<p>I agree that Harris presents utilitarianism, though he oddly avoids the word.  That it is a variation of altruism, where each individual sacrifices himself to the group.  Harris does not give a rational justification for this, just assumes everyone will <i>feel</i> it's correct.  Feelings are not reason, so you have to ask where such feelings come from.",1270623001

1246625,comment,1246395,1246395,0,0,dasht,,,"I voted up this link (after it appeared on the front page) but precisely because I think it is such ridiculous hooey that it is worth commenting on.   It's errors are abundant so I'll choose just one which, taken as paradigm, can be used to discover several others:<p>The author of the article quotes Hitchens as saying (I've added <i>emphasis</i>): ""[C]onscience is innate,"" and `[e]verybody but the psychopath' has the `feeling' that this is so.  This `innate conscience' is what makes murder and theft `abhorrent to humans <i>without any further explanation</i>'; it is what gives children an `innate sense of fairness'; and it is what informs each of us of our `duty to others.'""<p>Now, Hitchens is perfectly comprehensible there and there is ample objective empirical evidence to back him up.  The author has made a fine enough paraphrase of one of Hitchens' main points.   The author of the article immediately goes on to err very badly:<p>Let's pick apart his next few sentences:<p>""The notion of an `innate conscience' is, of course, not original to Hitchens; the history of philosophy is replete with appeals to a `moral sense' or `moral intuition' or `moral law within.'""<p>Pardon me but <i>philosophy has nothing to do with it</i>.  Such philosophers as the author refers to are trying to <i>explain</i> the fact that, by in large, we know right from wrong.   As Hitchens asserted, we know things about morality and we know that we know these things ""without need for further explanation"".  The author of the article ignores those words and proceeds to assume, behind Hitchens' simple statement, an implicit explanation.   Once he does so, he is no longer arguing against Hitchens, he is arguing against a straw-man.<p>To borrow an example from a writer I like:  Suppose you and I are sitting at the bar of a pub, chatting about sports.  One of the patron's very friendly dogs is sitting outside waiting patiently, tied to a parking meter.  A fellow walks by on the sidewalk and without provocation kicks the dog, hard.<p>Now, do we need to discuss what in scripture forbids such an act?  Do we need to question whether our Kantian faculty for moral reasoning rings true when it signals the evil of such an act?  Or do we just immediately agree that ""That ain't right"" and perhaps step outside to confront the man what done it?   Is <i>anything</i> added to our obvious and gut-level reaction by additional discussion of where, in principle, that reaction comes from?   Or can we just stipulate that it was in fact wrong to kick the dog and that almost certainly intervention is called for?<p>We do not need God in order to decide that kicking the dog was wrong.  We do not need Kant or Descartes.  We do not need debate.  ""Hey, look: that guy just kicked that dog!""  What more do you need?  Perhaps the philosopher at the other end of the bar will say ""No, perhaps he kicked the dog to prevent a larger tragedy.""   Perhaps the theist next to him will point out the dog's place as chattel in the divine order of things.  Perhaps the evolutionary biologist will try to stay our intervention by pointing out that we are reacting to genetically programmed perceptions.  Perhaps the Taoist will solemnly observe that the dog can not experience pleasure unless it also experiences pain.   Have any of these stooges added anything worthy of the moment?    No, of course not.  The situation needs no discussion - no explanation.   What would happen, in real life, is that a large number of patrons of the pub would rise to intervene - <i>and next to nobody would blame them</i>.  And this would be a moral reaction.  We know right from wrong when we see it laid bare.  No further explanation needed.<p>In order to ""argue"" with Hitchens, the author posits an ""explanation"" for this knowing and then proceeds to tear apart that explanation: a kind of intellectual onanism.<p>I do not mean, to answer how the author of the article burbles on, that we always make right choices or that we always agree about what the right choices are.   Of course we do not.   We generally agree (though not universally) in recognizing extreme cases of sociopathy.  We all make moral mistakes, often tragic.  We all are sometimes slow if not entirely unable to recognize our mistakes.  These are separate questions and positing God, Kantian moral faculties, evolutionary proscriptions, etc. -- these add nothing to the conversation with the possible partial exception of the evolutionary psychiatrists who can at least provide some partial post-mortem analysis of failings, sometimes.<p>The author continues:<p>""But although many have appealed to such a sense, none has ever been able to overcome the fact that it is observationally false that humans possess an innate sense of right and wrong: Many people, and not just psychopaths, make horrifically bad choices that ruin their own lives, the lives of others, or both.""<p>How this contradicts Hitchens is a truth to be found only in the authors' own imagination.  Yes, tragedy happens.  And yes, not everything is clear cut, especially in the heat of a decision-making moment.<p>""And not all of these people know that their actions are morally wrong. On the contrary, many believe that their actions are morally justified.""<p>None of which contradicts anything Hitchens' said.  The author seems to have assumed that Hitchens was talking about, to sling jargon around, an infallible moral faculty present in all but psychopaths.   Had Hitchens ever, anywhere, argued for such a thing the author would have a point.  Hitchens didn't.  The author doesn't.",1270620568

1246611,comment,1246065,1246505,0,0,btilly,,,"Any simple explanation you find will be of the form ""lies for children"".  The real explanation is, of course, ""None of the things we've tried have succeeded in making testable predictions.""  But to understand that you need to understand what we have tried, which means understanding the theories, which means a very considerable investment of effort.<p>That said, I can illustrate the conflict.  The fundamental idea of general relativity is that mass warps the structure of space-time, and we perceive this warpage as gravity.  One fundamental idea of quantum mechanics is that a quantum mechanical system is always in some superposition of possible states, and the superposition adds.  (Since we're dealing with a complex wave, sometimes adding 2 possibilities leads to cancellation in one place and strengthening in another, creating interference patterns.  But fundamentally we're just adding waves.)<p>One of the things that nobody knows how to do is add different kinds of warpage of space-time in a linear way and get a sensible answer.<p>Let's try something else.  In QM perturbations of any kind of field must have an associated particle with describable characteristics.  For a random instance vibrations in a lattice of atoms can be described by a field that must have an associated particle.  That particle is called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon</a>.  (Phonons are not fundamental physical particles, but they do exist mathematically and their effects have been experimentally measured.)<p>Now in QM the exchange of particles actually gives rise to various forces.  Furthermore the ability for virtual particles to arise and disappear as long as you stay under the Heisenberg limit causes the prospect of particles interacting with various things, including themselves.  When you try to calculate all of these interactions you wind up getting infinities added and subtracted with each other.  There is a mathematical trick called renormalization that lets you cancel these out.<p>Now in General Relativity you have gravitational waves.  (They have never been directly detected, but binary star systems have been observed losing power in accord with the predictions of GR.)  If you try to fit these waves into QM you should wind up with particles called gravitons.  But when you try to do renormalization on them, the procedure fails and you get infinities out.<p>So we have failures both ways.  Attempts to state QM within the framework of GR fails because we don't know how to add perturbations in coordinate systems.  Fields that GR predicts exist cause QM to break down and give impossible answers.  The theories just don't merge.  Experiment doesn't help because each theory is a very good description in its own region, and we can't get data on how the theories break down between their areas of specialization because we can't create regions with high gravitational curvature on a scale where quantum mechanical effects matter.<p>If you want to know more about some of the attempts to reconcile the theories I'd suggest reading up on ""string theory"", ""quantum loop gravity"", and trying to understand John Baez.  I'm not a physicist and don't understand John Baez myself, so I can only wish you good luck if you choose to dive more deeply into this.",1270620119

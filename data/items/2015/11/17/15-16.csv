Evil is a word humans use to categorize things, not a description of objective reality.<p>I would agree that most people don&#x27;t think of themselves as bad, but since there&#x27;s no objective &#x27;bad&#x27;, wether or not they&#x27;re &#x27;actually bad&#x27; is up to the observer. When a person is labeled as &#x27;evil&#x27; it&#x27;s not a description of them as a person but a description of what the describer thinks of them. Hitler wasn&#x27;t evil because he killed millions of people, he was evil because the general consensus is that doing the stuff he did makes you an evil person.<p>If one loses sight of this and starts think of evil as objective reality, they&#x27;re taking their biases and opinions as objective reality, and down that path lies ruin.",1447775948

My family is fairly observant. We pray regularly and our dress and behaviour clearly suggests that we&#x27;re Muslim. We stayed in a small apartment about 5 years ago and had two families as neighbours. Both were Hindu but one was very observant - they were Brahmins and very strict in matters of food, worship, dress etc. The others were also Hindus but less observant. They weren&#x27;t vegetarian and were, atleast apparently, less observant than the Brahmin couple.<p>We all had young kids at the time and the Brahmin folks were much more comfortable leaving their daughter with us than with the other couple. This was mostly because we were conservative just like them and so could appreciate how strictly they followed their own dietary laws and things like that. They also trusted us to follow the same with their daughter. They weren&#x27;t so confident with the other couple.<p>Interacting with people in real life belonging to any group is very transformative and &quot;online&quot; relationships are not really a servicable substitute.",1447775927

If you get a random thought while free writing and write about it that increases your investment in that thought and I&#x27;m sure if you continue stream of consciousness writing on some of the more bothersome thoughts you might have problems with the activity. In meditation, it&#x27;s more about noticing you had a thought and then letting the thought go. The whole goal is to teach yourself to not become invested in the battery of thoughts and emotions that can come with each day.",1447775429

In the past 5 years, about 2% of terrorist attacks in Europe were found to be religiously motivated [0].

Size estimates for the terrorist groups are: ISIS (52k - 258k [2]), Al Qaeda (19k-27k [3]). There are others, but I believe these are the main ones that people are talking about when worrying about terrorist threats abroad. We&#x27;re talking about 1 in 5,600 to 22,535.<p>My humble opinion is that the terrorist threat worldwide is indeed significant, but if you think that it is a problem with Islam, then you are playing right into the hands of the extremists, who want (and they have publicly published these intentions) to divide the world into two camps that hate each other. The more hatred you direct towards Muslims, the more you drive them apart from you.

The NES engineers took this cheat away by first writing a black screen and looking at the state of the photodiode, ensuring this would not be allowed. If it sees anything other than the black screen, it will record the shot as a miss.  It is rumored that some very early versions of the game might not have had this bug fixed, but there has been no demonstration of such a bug to date.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s funny that they mentioned this because my first memory of the NES was when a kid in my neighborhood got one for his birthday soon after they came out in the US.  This was the kid who got every cool toy and we were all a bit jealous.  At his birthday party we hooked up his NES Deluxe set (the one with the console, the light gun, and the robot that you used for Gyromite) and spent the afternoon messing with it and fighting over turns.<p>At some point, we found that pointing the light gun at the lamp in the room really did register as an automatic &quot;hit&quot; every time.

Getting to the rest with OSS will be... an uphill battle on top of an uphill battle. For now, we actually can use something like Qflow at least for larger nodes:<p><a href=""http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/</a><p>Still need standard, cell libraries for the target process.

Need common analog components which pro&#x27;s will have to do, as well. Need to integrate the digital and analog logic plus make sure whole chip is working. Gotta do the design rule checks to make sure physical properties of each layer or between them is right.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to it. I have one or more academic papers for almost every step in synthesis, re-synthesis, formal verification, gate-level testing... you name it.

Then, target ABC synthesis and/or VPR to it. Let&#x27;s us get open hardware while ignoring a large part of the design process.

If it takes off, do one for 28nm. Those should cover most use-cases with standard cell model for others.<p>Personally, though, I think there will be a mix of proprietary and FOSS tools. Best model is getting vendors to make theirs verifiable by FOSS tools so we can ignore the complexity of <i>how</i> they do it to focus on <i>what</i> they did and its equivalence/correctness. Especially good to get a smaller vendor like Mentor Graphics on it as a differentiator in post-Snowden market. They keep secret sauce while we get verification. Win, win.",1447774422

The best thing those German people had going for them was that they could die only once and, on a night of a fire storm, hopefully, likely quickly.  One of the worst horrors in the history of the planet.<p>For more, and more recently, in a 6 week air campaign and a 100 hour ground campaign, General Schwarzkopf brought to unconditional surrender Saddam&#x27;s army, the fourth largest army in the world, with 7 million men under arms.  <i>Mean</i>?  IIRC the US had more casualties (but not deaths) from recreation, e.g., softball, than from enemy action.  Soon the Iraqi air force got the message that it was not smart to fly at all (US AWACS could see them and send in F-15s) so would fly just to get away, low, slow, and to ditch in Iran.<p><i>Mean</i>?  General Schwarzkopf was asked what happened to the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers in the desert next to Saudi Arabia.  The answer:  &quot;They are still there.&quot;<p><i>Mean</i>?  When a US A-10 flew over the Iraqi troops, they rushed out with white flags.  \nWhat one or a few A-10s did to\nthe escaping Iraqi troops on the road from Kuwait City back to Iraq -- turned the whole crowded road into teeth, hair, eyes, blood, guts, big pieces made into small ones, and fires, all in just a few A-10 passes -- so shocked the world that Bush 41 rushed to stop such actions.  The A-10 is one mean machine -- reduce really big pieces of metal to small ones in a few seconds.  And the A-10 is long out of date -- the US has much meaner machines now.<p>In Gulf War I,\nit went on this way, our tanks against theirs, our planes against theirs, and especially our F-117 stealth bomber against their radar and anti-aircraft artillery and missiles -- the F-117 flew through Saddam&#x27;s exploding defenses, bright enough to light up the night sky, and literally never got even a single scratch.  Why?  The sky is a really big place; shooting blind gives really small chance of hitting anything; and against the F-117 Iraq was shooting blind.  The F-117?  From the Lockheed Skunk Works -- bright guys out there.<p>We, here in the US, have GPS, surveillance satellites, smart bombs, cruise missiles, drones, the B-2, the F-22, the M1-A1 tank, aircraft carriers (so difficult to do well the US has about all there are in the world), submarines, both attack and missile firing, etc.<p><i>Mean</i>?  The US is mean, unique, world-class mean.<p>Net, without (5), that is, the determination of the US to avoid civilian casualties, the US could &quot;wipe the desert clean&quot; (from an <i>Indiana Jones</i> movie?) of ISIS in a day, much faster if we were in a hurry.  E.g., all within about 30 minutes of the ISIS areas, several US SSBNs, each with about 16 missiles, each missile with several warheads, each warhead with, IIRC, ballpark 330 KT of exploding fusion energy.<p>The US has been willing to kill enemy civilians in the past and can be again in the future.  So far, the US is still being a nice guy -- we just blew up some ISIS oil trucks, but first we dropped leaflets telling the civilians to get out of the way.<p>France?  &quot;They are a funny race&quot;, but they are no joke:  Great wine, cheese, bread, food, really pretty, world class feminine young women, great art, and more.  And, in pure and applied mathematics, both physical and medical science,  philosophy, etc. France has a very long history of world-class excellence.  Since WWII, some of the best mathematicians have been French -- e.g., Bourbaki.  \nMy favorite is J. Neveu.<p>In technical excellence, the French are no joke.  They are darned good at making both airplanes and working with nuclear materials, both the electricity generating kind and the exploding kind.<p>Net, anytime France wants to be &quot;merciless&quot; to ISIS, France can wipe the desert clean of ISIS in an hour.<p>France is a member of NATO.  Maybe that old organization looks like a comedy act, but without firing a single serious shot it&#x27;s kept the peace in Europe since 1945 or so.  Other members include Germany and England and, of course, the US.<p>Basically, ISIS attacked NATO; definitely a Darwin award on the way. As from Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, &quot;I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping tiger and fill him with a terrible resolve.&quot;  Yup.<p>If NATO were a country, then it would be by a wide margin the meanest in the solar system.<p>ISIS can&#x27;t make glass or matches but attacked NATO?  Did I mention wacko?<p>As soon as, as in no more than a day, the West is willing to kill ISIS civilians, there will be no more ISIS -- in the ISIS areas no more buildings, oil infrastructure, vehicles, tents, camels, flocks, or people.  None.  The desert wiped clean.  The West has killed plenty of civilians before and can do it again, especially against an enemy eager to kill civilians.<p>For me, IIRC ISIS has said that they intend to get a nuke bomb and explode it against the US.  They would likely aim for Wall Street, and I&#x27;m just 70 miles north of there.  They could hurt me.  &#x27;Nuff for me -- wipe the desert clean.",1447774420

There&#x27;s endless proof of this, see: Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, Finland, New Zealand.<p>Or better yet, see: Japan 1974, to 1994. 10% population growth, 1000% economic growth. If population were an integral factor, their growth would have been pathetic over that time.<p>Japan&#x27;s growth problem is debt, it&#x27;s destroying the capital that would otherwise be available for investment and business formation. The collapse of their savings rate has gone in tandem with that, and has further removed capital required for investment to generate productivity gains across an economy. Most of Europe and the US are mirroring that exact outcome, having loaded up on massive amounts of debt, they now find they can&#x27;t grow beyond extremely low levels. China is in the process of joining that club as well. You can have growth or tons of debt, you can&#x27;t have both together for long.",1447774108

However, common wisdom is not always correct, and, in fact, some other function types do have decidable equality, for example the type Cantor -> y for any type y with decidable equality, without contradicting Turing [...] This seems strange, even fishy, because the Cantor space is in some sense bigger than the integers.

Islam DID modernise; what we&#x27;re seeing is a regression, and I think a good deal of the blame can be placed on Washington and Moscow.<p>A half-century ago, very little of what was happening in the Middle East had anything to do with Islam. Most of the leadership in the region was secular; some states were quite democratic.<p>Egypt is one of the most conservative places today, chafes under the yoke of a secular government, wants to be Islamist. A half-century ago under Nasser, Egypt was the <i>source</i> of secularism in the region and was pulling other Middle Eastern nations towards its secular nationalism. Similarly, Iran was extremely secular in the 50s, and remained so under the Shah; many secular elements were instrumental in pulling him down.<p>Both of these poles were toppled by American efforts. Egypt was slowly pulled towards the Washington Consensus by buying the government, which became increasingly repressive. The same result was achieved in Iran with a coup that toppled the democratic government. In both of these places the reaction to a repressive secular regime had a strong Islamist component (both Shia and Sunni).<p>It wasn&#x27;t just in government that this reversal happened; the primary popular resistance organizations during the 20th century were also secular. The PLO, PFLP, and so on were all secular Marxist organisations, and young radicals fighting against American hegemony, the same space ISIS has colonised now, would not have given a fig for jihad. It was the failure of these organisations to provide the liberation sought that led to the eventual rise of Islamist alternatives, like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and al-Qaeda.<p>Contemporary Sunni jihadi ideology, in fact, had its origins in Egypt in the 60s thanks to people like Hassan al-Banna and Sayed Qutb, who developed much of the thinking that fueled al-Qaeda ideologically. This was a modern development, a reaction to the spread of secular thought and colonialism; it is not a continuous expression of Islam.<p>Finally, let&#x27;s not forget the active American support of conservative religious Saudi Arabia, to the tune of billions in military hardware and ironclad political alliance, as well as the arming of the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviets, both of which were signal events in fanning the flames of radical Sunni Islamism.",1447773872

And that’s what we know. That’s what we can do.&quot;<p>Seems logical that VR is going to be FBs next big play, and their ability to get a good product to market relatively soon will be crucial.

In fact it was even law in some states.<p>Beyond that, there were about all major western countries, France, UK, Belgium, Holland, Italy, etc, that had other people enslaved in colonies up until the sixties. 2+ billion people had their countries managed by foreigners, and their fellow countrymen tortured and executed when asking freedom (and sometimes, just killed for fun).<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-records-colonial-crimes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.monbiot.com/2005/12/27/how-britain-denies-its-holocausts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.monbiot.com/2005/12/27/how-britain-denies-its-hol...</a><p><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/inside-frances-secret-war-396062.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/inside-france...</a><p><a href=""http://www.theplaidzebra.com/human-zoos-one-europes-shameful-secrets-ended-50s/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theplaidzebra.com/human-zoos-one-europes-shameful...</a><p>Heck, even in Paris itself, the French police famously killed over 200 Algerians marching for their country&#x27;s freedom in a single day in 1961 -- and it took them 40+ years, after all officials were dead or too old, to finally admit it and ask for an apology.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_massacre_of_1961"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_massacre_of_1961</a><p>These countries also thought that they should have a say as to whether a remote country should have this or that president or regime -- to the point of toppling legitimate regimes, bombing those countries, coming to assist one party or another in a civil war, etc.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9ta...</a><p>There have been over 2 million victims of those interventions in the last 10 years alone.

I knew a guy who trained multiple networks in parallel for his M.S. and then combined them by just averaging the corresponding weights.  It seemed to work well.  For this to work, the networks needed to have the same architecture (same number of layers, nodes in each layer and same connectivity between layers).<p>Now if you just want to train multiple neural networks (or other classifiers) on different datasets (to have different strengths) then you can keep them separate and build a composite system that lets each network &quot;vote&quot; on an answer to a given problem; the decision of the overall system is a weighted some of the components.

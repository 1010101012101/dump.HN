Here&#x27;s the conceptual reason why. Imagine that you&#x27;re near the left side of the sphere or cylinder. Then the mass to your left is closer to you, and therefore every kg of it exerts a strong gravitational pull (as force is proportional to 1/r^2). But although the mass to your right is farther away and thus exerts less gravitational force per kg, there&#x27;s a lot more of it: roughly speaking, the amount of mass in a given direction is proportional to r^2 (times the solid angle it subtends). This factor of r^2 precisely cancels out the effects of the 1/r^2 weaker force per kg. (And yes, a careful derivation using calculus or Gauss&#x27;s law would be more rigorous.)<p>None of that applies in the case of a torus. If I&#x27;m in the hole of the torus close to the left side, there&#x27;s still a 1/r^2 difference in gravitational force per kg favoring the pull toward the left. But now, roughly speaking, the extra mass to my right is only greater by a factor of r (coming from the circumference of a circle rather than the surface area of a sphere). So the far side of the torus becomes less and less significant the father away it gets.<p>On top of all that, my impression from the article was that this sort of planet would require a <i>really</i> fast rate of rotation. I get the sense that the virtual &quot;centrifugal&quot; force plays a major role in the physics here. (Or if you prefer, that it&#x27;s not reliable to ignore the effects of being in an accelerated reference frame.)",1391612395

7184030,comment,7182656,7182656,20,0,bane,,,"The one time I dealt with Autonomy was sitting in on some of the sales process to a large non-profit. I hadn&#x27;t really heard of them or seen their products anywhere at all, yet they were apparently doing well. I think this was around the time they bought Verity so there was a lot of buzz in the air that Autonomy could be the next Google and it&#x27;d be good to get in with them.<p>During their 20 allotted minutes, the Autonomy sales guy provided an <i>hour</i> long virtuoso demonstration of a decidedly uninteresting basic search appliance with an enormous price tag that would have bought them six times as much if the non-profit just hired a staff to build it all from scratch from the ground up.<p>The non-profit was looking for big-data analytics and got a demo of some very uninteresting, <i>very</i> basic, text analytics tools, and a half-hour dog and pony show about how they could build whatever more sophisticated analytic tools they needed, and oh yeah, there would be a very long and very expensive enterprise integration period.<p>The sales guy then made sure to mention that the next day he wouldn&#x27;t be able to do any follow up since he took a position in another sales office in a different state, so follow up with some other guy who wasn&#x27;t present at the demo.<p>Of course having run well over their allotted time-budget (always a great way to see if a company respects contractual budgets), the CEO didn&#x27;t have time to ask questions like &quot;presumably you&#x27;ve built more interesting text analytics tools before, we can&#x27;t be the only ones asking for these pretty basic things, why would we pay more for you to &#x27;develop&#x27; them again?&quot; and similar.<p>Fast forward a week, meeting with the other guy to finish feeling things out (there were some integration pieces they were still interested in). The non-profit was basically told that his business wasn&#x27;t worth the time of this very junior sales guy because his other clients were talking about bigger engagements. And that to get more of his effort, they&#x27;d have to consider a larger package with more included services (on-site consultants). He left halfway through the meeting to go joke and throw a football with some of his buddies down the hall for a few minutes, in full view of our group, while the CEO of the non-profit sat his mouth agape, came back and asked if we&#x27;d decided to move on or go with the bigger deal so we could get his full attention.<p>It was pretty much this experience that put them into the &quot;corrupt as fuck snake oil peddlers&quot; category for me and none of this news surprises me in the least.",1391612289

7184022,comment,7183682,7183860,24,0,waps,,,"The netflix data itself points to a gradual lowering of bandwidth to their service. Now here&#x27;s 2 scenarios :<p>1) Verizon decided to enter some router configurations that affect the packet forwarding to Netflix (well, most likely FROM netflix, as the internet is not actually symmetrical). What we should see as a result of this is a sudden change in bandwidth.<p>2) The load on the interfaces in between is changing, either because of more netflix subscribers, more AWS traffic, or more netflix traffic. Since these are things happening slowly over time, you&#x27;d see a gradual worsening of traffic conditions.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty fucking likely that what&#x27;s happening here is 2). Now granted, Verizon could solve this problem by cooperating with Netflix. But for them that&#x27;s an expense with no upside, so likely they&#x27;re demanding Netflix make it worth their while to upgrade the interconnects.<p>This is one of the basic problems with the internet today. It used to be the case that bandwidth between providers was much more plentiful than last-mile bandwidth. So we upgraded last-mile bandwidth. Problem : doing that resulted in an exponential increase in load on the core network and the interconnects between different networks. Needless to say, nobody can keep up with exponentially rising demands (especially without subscriber growth). The basic problem is that a linear increase in bandwidth for the customer results in an exponential increase in costs for the ISP (so -surpise- small ISPs don&#x27;t feel the effects nearly as badly).<p>So ISPs are desperate. Their costs are spiralling out of control, with everyone demanding they follow this exponential curve, but of course their customers not willing to pay for it (and all the money in the world would only buy time if thrown at this problem). Demanding the ISPs pay for it is simply not going to work. Right now, yes, they could theoretically pay for it, but that won&#x27;t last long.<p>Plus Netflix is being a rather bad netizen themselves. The polite thing to do is to carry the traffic to very close to the user on your own network, and only use other&#x27;s links, especially transit, as a last resort (&quot;cold-potato&quot; routing, for content providers). Netflix has caches, but no own network.<p>There&#x27;s other problems that result from this cost problem. Already transcontinental and other long-haul links are strained to the limit. This has resulted in a massive degradation of non-local internet traffic, and it&#x27;s getting worse fast.<p>It is really a very simple problem. You have consumers, and you have producers. And you get more and more of each. To a limited approximation you can assume everyone on the internet is both. To simplify things, let&#x27;s say everyone uses a tiny amount of everyone else&#x27;s services. Now given N participants in the network, what is the load on the core network ?<p>N * (N - 1) =~ N^2 (assuming full duplex links, which would be generally correct for the internet)<p>So adding more participants in the internet increases resources required to give every existing participant in the network his &quot;old&quot; speed. These need to be paid for. But unless everyone want to start paying an amount for your internet connections that rises with the square of the size of the internet, we&#x27;re going to see progressively worse and worse throttling. Right now the strategy is fast becoming limiting interconnect capacity to prevent the core network overloading, which would have far worse consequences.<p>While, yes, historically this has mostly been monopolies cheating the market, that&#x27;s less and less true. This is going to get worse, fast. And since those resources are obviously not going to be made available, there&#x27;s only one thing to say :<p>Get used to it.",1391612199

And it&#x27;s something that any web designer could trivially test for.<p>And yet they don&#x27;t bother! Why? Probably because they&#x27;re mostly self-centered 20-something hipster douchebags, who can&#x27;t even imagine there&#x27;s someone with worse eyesight than they have. Or maybe their sense of &quot;aesthetics&quot; trumps any consideration of &quot;accessibility&quot;. In other words: &quot;Fuck off if you&#x27;re too old to comfortably read 10 pt type. We don&#x27;t need your kind on our website&quot;.<p>Worse, there are a few sites, such as Bloomberg, that somehow manage to trick Firefox into <i>not</i> rendering their fonts at a minimum 18 pt, but instead render substantially smaller. That&#x27;s right, some hipster web designer at Bloomberg went out of his way to make sure the text displayed is small. He&#x27;s probably quite proud of this.<p>Firefox does works OK on 99% of the web in terms of font size. Unfortunately, stuff breaks in other ways. E.g. when a large minimum font is selected, text often simply disappears off to the right of a page. So then a search box is just not displayed at all, because it&#x27;s off to the right of the page. Or text just disappears off the bottom of a block. Probably something to do with fixed widths, I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m not an HTML guy.<p>Chrome apparently has a large contingent of hipster douchebags working on it. Apparently the concept of &quot;18 pt&quot; is too technical for their genius IQ brains. So they  just have simpler font size selections such as Small, Medium, and Large. Unfortunately not granular enough when compared to Safari or Firefox. And Chrome is also far worse than Firefox in displaying pages in tiny type, even when Font size is set to Large.<p>Still, lots of sites do it right. E.g. Hacker News is no problem. A very simple layout and very readable. (Now if they would only fix that expired link problem).<p>I repeat, I&#x27;m bitching about something that is trivial, a mere inconvenience, compared to what the blind encounter.

I mean I&#x27;m a relatively healthy 20-something and was denied health insurance several times, and when I was approved, was paying ridiculous amounts per month because I was 10 pounds overweight.<p>Putting those prices back in line for most people and not tying health insurance to a full-time job is the whole point.

This would not allow for any solid crust to form.<p>I agree with srl: gravitation must get gradually closer to zero in the inner part, where the molten lava, not being pulled down by any gravity, continually explodes due to the pressure of the internal gases, forming a fuzzy ring of (cooling?) debris, a gradually spreading chaotic mix of rocks, the greater part going towards the torus&#x27; real centre of gravity, leaving underlying molten rock exposed to follow their fate later on - in short a crumbling effect that cannot be arrested. This rocky chaos may later start collapsing in the middle of the hole, forming the seed of the future planet.\nBTW any large enough asteroid impact would also spell doom to the whole torus planet and either wreak havoc, rip it apart (in interesting ways, depending on location and direction of the impact) or cause the central &quot;hole&quot; to collapse sooner, finally reducing the planet into a more spherical shape - enter the Torusmageddon :)<p>Just my two cents.",1391611053

Similarly it takes months for a Titan to build, but that means moving components between the factory and the CSAA and the storage every once in a while and re-fueling your tower-stations weekly or something.  It&#x27;s not someone working 40/hours a week to build a Titan.<p>The hard part of that is the infrastructure - you need to own a star system and put up a bunch of towers and fuel them and haul/build/mine the components and minerals to your (hopefully out-of-the-way) system, and you need to have firepower on call to defend your operation if you&#x27;re attacked.  And the character training to pilot the Titan needs implants that are expensive and mean he can&#x27;t be risked in combat (so you need a second account).  Most of that (owning star systems, on-call firepower, maintaining towers, hauling/mining minerals, having spare/secondary accounts) is stuff that large alliances have to do anyhow for their other strategic needs (equipping sub-capital players, paying bills, constructing jump bridge networks, etc.) so for them it&#x27;s just a bit of extra load on the logistics team, and they usually have economies of scale (they have so much money and space they can have 3 Titans in the hopper at once).",1391609975

Somewhat unintuitively, the gravitational force on the inner part of the torus (the surface closest to the center, on the plane of the axes) is 0.<p>The pathological example is a hollow sphere of dense material. Outside the sphere, it &quot;looks like&quot; (if you just measure g) a solid planet. Inside the sphere, there is no gravitational field whatsoever, no matter how close you come to the surface.<p>Surprisingly, this holds no matter how large the sphere is. Suppose you&#x27;re sitting on the inside of the surface of the sphere, and you decrease the radius a bit. Now the gravitational pull /away/ from this surface decreases like r^-2, so you would expect the gravity towards the surface (which is essentially unchanged) to increase. The issue is that the amount of material opposite you - the surface area of a sphere, really - also increases like r^2. (This is informal, but the best I can do for an intuitive explanation.)<p>Tough to find a good explanation of this online. <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/364/gravity-on-a-doughnut-shaped-mobius-planet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/364/gravity-on-a-...</a>",1391609464

Such losses cause tectonic shifts in the balance of power.<p>Additionally, War in EVE is largely about sapping the opponents&#x27; morale - it could take months of fighting for hours every night to take a defended region, but if you get the enemy&#x27;s pilots discouraged and not logging in or avoiding the fighting or even switching to another group then you can win a lot faster.

At the same time I&#x27;m dismayed by how my government is run on a day-to-day (year-to-year?) basis.  So national pride is simply a feeling you have or you don&#x27;t.<p>Nobel prizes and Olympic medals on the other hand are some combination of nurture versus nature, and while the “We are all human beings, and our nationality is simply an accident of birth.” quote is factually true, people making that statement should (in theory) have a long list of people who helped them on their way to achieving that dream.

7183698,comment,7183136,7183371,1,0,leobelle,,,"I get the gist of what you&#x27;re saying, but the reality of it is that nationality matters a great deal. It&#x27;s part of our identity whether you realize it or not. As many immigrants know too well national identity isn&#x27;t as arbitrary as it seems. It isn&#x27;t just the exclusion you will face in your new home, there&#x27;s a strong internal compass that will always point home for many people. It&#x27;s part of who we are, and a great deal of people have worked hard and sacrificed much for the sake of their country. This picture becomes clearer with age and experience. I celebrate diversity in its many forms. I like new ideas, learning new and different old ways of thinking and doing, but I also know where I come from, and that&#x27;s as valuable as appreciating others. Maybe even more so.",1391608833

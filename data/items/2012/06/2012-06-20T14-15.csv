Unfortunately, while the iPad is improving, its still pretty weak in that area.

Most code I've seen has some poorly written corners; something where someone was in a hurry, or didn't know what they were doing, or someone inexperienced with the project started working on it, or the like.<p>The point is, these were real-world codebases with substantial unit tests, and they had type errors that weren't caught by these unit tests.<p>Honestly, in several groups I've worked with, I've had trouble getting people to add unit tests even to code in dynamic languages. A codebase which already has substantial unit tests is likely to be better than average, on that basis alone.<p>This is about saying, in the messy real world, do unit tests actually make type safety obsolete. And the answer is, no, they don't, even code with fairly good test coverage can be improved by adding typechecking. Now, there is the question of whether writing in the dynamic language allowed people to write code faster (it's generally a lot easier to translate correct code once it's written than to write it in the first place); or whether some of the more highly dynamic features of dynamic languages benefit writing or deploying code.",1340204171

The counterfactuals to the claims of dynamic type advocates were already true and provable, so even if the sample size of the codebases studied were statistically significant (not to mention vetted for <i>quality</i> of unit test as well as <i>coverage</i>) the conclusions are nevertheless trivial.<p>In addition, the hidden assumption is that all static and dynamic typing are created equal, i.e., since Haskell is statically typed and Haskell appears to have caught Python bugs that unit tests did not, therefore Java will catch bugs in a Ruby codebase, C++ will catch bugs in a JavaScript codebase, etc. Of course this assumption is gratuitous. Haskell in particular has a specific sort of type checking that is far different from Java's or C++'s, for instance.<p>Further, not all <i>dynamic</i> systems are created equal. Ruby, for instance, I think can be shown to require fewer lines of code to achieve similar functionality to, for instance, Java. Fewer lines of code, should in principle mean fewer opportunities for defects. Dynamic languages with metaprogramming features like Ruby's or Smalltalk's should in principle be able to eliminate more code duplication than an environment like C++. This aspect of dynamic languages should be taken into account, again with a statistically significant sample size, and weighed against bugs caught by static typing.<p>The study is interesting as a preliminary investigation, but the conclusions should have been much more modest, proportionate to both the sample size, in terms of % of production codebases and the extremely important idiosyncratic nature of Haskell vs. other static typed environments. Something like: ""The study has shown Haskell's type system will catch some bugs not caught in an otherwise well-covered Python codebase. These bugs could <i>in theory</i> have been caught by unit tests, therefore it is recommended that when using a dynamic language, more care must be taken to cover these types of bugs.""<p>That would have been a more appropriate and modest conclusion, consistent with the data, than the sweeping generalization ""You need Static Typing.""",1340203622

Control is literally the percent of all possible outcomes in which the result of the vote/election is decided by the shareholder's vote.<p>In the link you will find a second graph, in which I give the chances of winning a shareholder vote. Here there is an assumption that each shareholder is as likely to vote one way as another. There is no doubt it is a softer number, but I report it because people can understand what it means much faster than control.<p>Now these issues of psychology and feelings about particular issues can be accounted for, as you can imagine its necessary when working on the activist situations we cut our teeth on, but there we generally have public statements about which way particular shareholders plan to vote, or how they feel. When looking at a founders long term control, its best to leave out these issue. Less good information is better than more so-so information.<p>If you want to know a about founders ability to do something specific that would polarize shareholders around common interests, such as sell the company at a price that is personally rewarding, but not great for the investors, that calculation can be done.

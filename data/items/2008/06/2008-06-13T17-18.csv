216940,comment,216381,216908,0,0,lg,,,"On MW, there are an infinite number of worlds at time t if an infinite number of quantum outcomes has occurred by time t.  Anyway, it sounds like you're thinking this: There are an infinite number of worlds.  A quantum event happens in many of them.  There are more worlds where it happens than where it doesn't.  Therefore this event is more likely.<p>But that's not MW.  MW says that something happens, and when it happens, you get one world for each outcome.  There's a problem here because what these outcomes are depend on the basis you write the wave function in, but that's a different issue.  It's certainly not saying that there are an infinite number of worlds, each with a determined series of events, and we have probabilities because some of those worlds are more numerous than others.  That's modal realism, as I said in a comment above.<p>By the way, that doesn't just raise its head in the context of quantum mechanics.  It only does because it gives us reason to believe that it's physically possible that things could've been different than they actually are.  But it seems possible-period that things could've been different, even if physics was deterministic.  Even though it might've been physically determined that I went to the grocery store yesterday, it's certainly possible <i>tout court</i> that the whole universe had gone differently, and I could've gone to Fenway to see the Sox game instead.  But does that mean that there's an alternate universe where my otherworldly counterpart went to Fenway?  Isn't there a simpler explanation for why that's possible?

216919,story,,,1,1,unalone,"Ask YC: Do you think there's an audience online interested in reading/writing?",,"I had an idea back in September about creating a new method for editing and revising text files online. You know, for people interested in critiquing things and for writers who want feedback on their writing. Right now, the only solution available is text document - textarea, which is inefficient and scares away both writers and editors. I had a better idea and worked on mapping out a quick idea for a site.<p>I've had quite a lot of work since then, but now that I'm graduating I have a lot of time to actually work on things, and I'm wondering if it's worth trying to make this site. I'm not thinking about venture funding or anything regarding making money off of it, not yet. I just want to see if it's possible to make a sizable set of writers online, more so than there are on sites already. (Not counting Scribd, which is focused more on display than it is on editing/revising.)<p>My one worry is that text takes more effort from users. It's harder to create and it's harder to read over, even if editing is made potentially simpler. Do you think that Internet users would be willing to spend their time reading and editing people's work if it was made easy for them? Or do you think that there's an inherent barrier in text that keeps people out? What would you think considering the various communities online you've all seen?",1213376956

Newton, Swedenberg, Cantor and Bohm come to mind.  That in itself isn't hurtful.  But when the nature of the belief causes them to not deal with a major facet of human existence, it starts to be bad.",1213376530

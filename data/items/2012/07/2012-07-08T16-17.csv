That said, my immediate thought is ""what does it take to become one of those core committee members?""<p>Read into that what you will ;-)<p>The other part I think worth a cautionary mention is that you appear to use the words management and leadership as though they are the same. They are not. It's a clich, but it describes the difference well -<p>If there's a team of people clearing a path through the jungle with machetes, the manager's job is to make sure the machetes are sharp, the workers have enough water, and generally that they keep clearing a path.<p>The <i>leader</i> however, climbs a tree and looks around to make sure the jungle is being cleared in the right place.<p>Lastly, you speak of accountability. And yet you do not mention authority. The one cannot exist without the other. I've had accountability in every single management role I've had and never the authority to run the team or project as I saw fit. There's an imbalance there that has always spelt epic fail.",1341766627

It's not sexist to have such words, it's just useful.<p>Similarly, being able to tell the sex of the people involved in a union, is useful information. It means you don't have to ask for clarification, and reduces the chances of faux pas.<p>To compare it to a persons colour is silly. Sex matters...

As an American, I have to agree with the general proposition that British colonial rule is not the best form of government, but as an observer of the great variety of former British colonies in the world that are now independent countries, I invite readers here to think about why some of those countries (including some that became independent more recently than India) are now prosperous and free. Perhaps there are details about life in India and policies of the independent government of India that kept India comparatively poor and backward even after India won independence. It's a backward-looking set of excuses to say ""British rule was bad for us,"" as it may indeed have been, without also being curious about ""How have other countries thrived since winning independence from Britain?""<p>As far as the bad influence of colonialism goes, I think in general French or Spanish colonial rule have been even worse for most countries than British colonial rule. And it appears that one way harm was mediated to many places of the world by colonial rule is that socialism (especially hard-left socialism like Marxism) was transmitted to colonies by Western colonial officials, and then many countries pursued ineffective policies for national development for decades after independence, because they were stuck in socialist ideology for too long.",1341766464

He runs fast, but panting heart tells him he cannot run much longer. He sees a tree. Relief! He accelerates and gets to it in one last despairing stride. He climbs the tree. The tiger snarls below him, but he feels that he has at last escaped its snapping jaws. But no -- what's this? The branch on which he is sitting is weak, and bends dangerously. This is not all; wood-mice are gnawing away at it; before long they will eat through it and it will snap and fall. The branch sags down over a wall. Aha! Escape? Perhaps our hero can swim? But the well is dry, and there are snakes writhing and hissing on its bed. What is our hero to do?

We have a very specific approach in mind.<p>><i>The ""flat"" organizational model seems like a good thing, until you realize that what it actually means is that there's a high managerial branching factor-- sometimes 25 or higher-- which spreads managers way too thin. </i><p>In most cases the goal is to get rid of management altogether, and distribute management <i>functions</i> to the teams themselves.  You are assuming a direct command and control structure, a flat organization that works is something a little different.  I will talk about this below.<p>><i>Most ""flat"" organizations aren't egalitarian-- just lazy when it comes to figuring out a structure.</i><p>100% correct there, but wrong when you say:<p>><i>Instead, they've traded official organizational hierarchy for unofficial, unstable arrangements that are actually more problematic. In a stable arrangement, your boss is your boss and you are not his competition. In an unstable and informal environment, these ""de facto"" bosses are also direct competition. That never works well.</i><p>Again, this entirely suggests an idea of command and control rather than something else.....<p>> <i>People management is still necessary, and good people management is extremely valuable (and, sadly, somewhat rare in many organizations). At one time, I thought otherwise, and that it was the engineers only who actually mattered to the health of an organization, but I was wrong.</i><p>The problem is though that managers inherently filter communication and this leads to high costs as well.  Again, if you want to make sure that specific things get done with appropriate accountability then you want to have this structure, but it isn't the only option.<p>You are probably wondering by now what the alternative is.  The alternative is to have a company based on openness, collaboration, communication, collegiality, and entrepreneurship.  This sort of culture is very hard to build and maintain.  It means that the executives have to cultivate a well-earned reputation of listening to the folks on the job floor, mentoring them, and only taking action when necessary.<p>We aren't talking egalitarian here.  Rather leadership is distributed and people can lead --- or follow --- based on their ability to convince other people that given approaches are good for the company.<p>The way we run the LedgerSMB (<a href=""http://www.ledgersmb.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ledgersmb.org</a>) development community is as follows:<p>1) There is a core committee of three of us, though one is pretty in-active and may not last so much longer.  we have the power to ban people, but mostly we just help out folks, do development, and so forth.  We are the primary developers in addition to managing the community.<p>2)  Everyone else can contribute but is expected to collaborate on their contributions with the rest of the community.  Then they can find a committer to commit.  Committers are expected to mentor non-committers.<p>I think this can work as a business management structure.  You can have executives who handle planning, organizational goals, etc.  But they do this  in collaboration with others in the company in whatever position want to be involved.<p>The big limiting factor though is this.  If the executives can't get a well-earned reputation for openness, the whole thing falls apart and you have to go to a de facto or official command and control structure.",1341763334

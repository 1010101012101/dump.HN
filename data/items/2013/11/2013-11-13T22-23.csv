A lot of it comes down to the difference in abilities between kickers and punters between those levels.<p>In high school some teams will always go for a 2 point conversion after a touchdown.  Not because they will make it a large percentage of the time but because they will be lucky if their kicker will make the extra point 20 percent of the time.<p>In high school and college it makes sense to go for it on fourth down more often because most teams don&#x27;t have punters that can consistently kick the ball 50 yards or down it inside the 10.<p>Professional kickers can consistently make a field goal from 40 yards, some have really good percentages from 50.  An onside kick that fails almost gives the other team 3 free points in the pros.  An if the receiving team is expecting it the percentage of the time it works be small.  In high school, where you almost have to be at extra point distance to even think of trying a field goal, I could see it being useful.<p>Main point:  The coaches at each level are, for the most part, acting rationally.  The occasional deviation from the typical strategy is like a bluff in cards.  You need to do it occasionally so that they can&#x27;t gang up on your typical strategy.",1384383469

But the remaining 20% is a long tail of utterly essential features that are completely fragmented between users. Each user only cares about 80.1% of features, but without the extra 0.1% your spreadsheet is useless.<p>One user will care that it doesn&#x27;t print. Another will care that it can&#x27;t do a sum over columns. Another will care that it doesn&#x27;t have charts. Another will care that you can&#x27;t make a bold heading.

I&#x27;ve looked at residential building codes, because I&#x27;ve done my own work like building a deck, framing and finishing my basement, and researching how to build concrete & steel suspended floors, or wood floors - seeing what their spans are - seeing how lightweight steel framing vs wood framing works - it&#x27;s quite fascinating.  (I was considering designing my own house, but the wife shot that down)<p>And there is simply NO COMPARISON in complexity to software.  In physical building, you over engineer and get redundancy.  You also know that almost everyone builds plumb and level, rectangular rooms, with easy span and shear calculations.  You also know that wood follows a predictable strength pattern.  So you put in enough nails of the right length, to enough wood of the right thickness, and you&#x27;re good.  How much intelligence do you think you need to follow a building code?

6729227,comment,6725096,6727599,2,0,jacobr1,,,"I think the biggest item missing when discussing BI is the huge change in behavior you have among those making near to the proposed BI payment. I suspect the marginal value of selling one&#x27;s labor would increase significantly against the opportunity cost of increased subsidized labor. That is maybe you are willing to work 40 hours/week minimum wage at a shit job compared to the alternative of unemployment. But if the alternative is just BI that that is better than the shit job. But these people still have the time to work and a willingness to earn more - but the bargaining position is different. So I suspect you would see raises rise for lower-end full-time positions, causing fewer of them to exist and spurring more automation while at the same time see lots more low marginal value jobs that have wage values below the new equilibrium point - such as more temp/part time positions where people can quickly enter/exit the job market when they need some additional cash - which in turn further raises the prices of semi-skilled labor since it will be more sparse.

The problem has always been the onerous approval chain in big companies, or crappy recruiters who fill the offer with discretionary bonuses that <i>add up</i> to my asking price.<p>With startups I can actually negotiate and get results. With big companies every major hike in the offer needs to go through a long approval chain. In a few instances I&#x27;ve been off the market by the time they came back to me.<p>I&#x27;ve also had less jerking around with the aforementioned bonus structures from startups. With big companies I&#x27;ve consistently gotten &quot;$Y base plus up to $Z discretionary&quot;, where Y + Z adds up to my asking. I&#x27;ve taken one such offer before and gotten completely shafted (i.e., highly positive performance review, bonus nowhere to be found). Startups are much, much more willing to simply pay my asking salary as base.<p>My impression with big companies is that their recruiters are their greatest liability. I&#x27;ve had recruiters ask for my salary be lowered because they&#x27;re paying for my move. No thanks, I know exactly how much a move costs and it&#x27;s nowhere near the (permanent! not one time!) reduction in salary. Things like that make a negotiation go south quickly.

Not enough to change the flavor, but just until you start to see the oils collect on the surface.  This only works with raw peppers.

That same US government has made it clear in public statements from the highest levels that they don&#x27;t consider foreigners to have any privacy rights at all that should prevent this.<p>Given that this all happens in secret, any promise made by any business operating in the US that they will safeguard personal data of non-US citizens to the standards required by European law is now known to be worthless, even if it was made with complete sincerity.<p>This is now common knowledge, and anyone controlling personal data in Europe would have to take it into consideration when applying the general data protection principles. In other words, any legal cover afforded by the Safe Harbor scheme may not be worth anything any more. (In case your question was intended to be about the Safe Harbor programme itself: This was created so that US businesses can be used to process personal data from Europe, as long as the US business promises to uphold similar data protection standards to those required by law of European businesses.)<p>So the bottom line is that as a European business, if you don&#x27;t have adequate disclosure when you collect any personal information that basically says it might be exported to somewhere without any safeguards on how it&#x27;s used, and you don&#x27;t get prior informed consent from everyone whose personal data you are dealing with, you might be on the hook legally for regulatory non-compliance as well as for any actual damages that result from any breach. Whether it&#x27;s possible to give prior informed consent to a <i>carte blanche</i> handling of the data is itself debatable.<p>(Just to be clear, my comments in this thread are based on the perception of the current situation as I have encountered it anecdotally in a few cases.

For example:<p><i>When given two numbers, if one wishes to find the quantities that give 0 when the second of the numbers is added to the product of the quantity and the first number and the quantity multiplied by itself, one should negate the first number and then either add or subtract the square root of the sum of the square of the first number minus four times the second number, and divide this summation by two.</i><p>That&#x27;s just the quadratic formula in disguise:<p><i>Let b and c be real [or complex] numbers, then</i><p><pre><code>   x^2 + b x + c = 0

We wanted to share some of our experiences and alternatives to enums that may be worth considering. Look forward to corrections, comments, and other feedback.",1384380861

My clients usually understand the benefits of using free software and express an intention to contribute back, but the process of contributing is not well understood. 
If you take some piece of open software and customize the hell out of it for a few months, you can&#x27;t just expect the upstream project to gratefully merge all your stuff because it&#x27;s &quot;free features&quot;. So it takes time and energy to work with the upstream project to identify useful parts and carefully integrate them into the upstream project, all while the customer is already in &quot;works for me&quot; mode and doesn&#x27;t care to change already deployed software....",1384380854
6729037,story,,,5,2,golubevpavel," Is it possible to deliver offline messages in P2P network on iOS/Android?",,"Im working on secure and anonymous instant messenger for Android and iOS. I believe that true security and anonymity cant be achieved in client-server architecture, therefore Im building up a P2P mobile IM without servers or super nodes. I have opted out of XMPP in favor of Torchat. So at this point my team is porting Torchat and OTR to iOS and Android. Source code is open on Github (https://github.com/prive). Torchat and OTR solve my objectives perfectly well  it provide security, lack of central nodes and servers, IP address masking, ease of use, reliable connectivity, encryption and authentication. But neither of them work if recipient of the message is offline. Message is lost and recipient never receives it when becomes online.<p>My assumption is that messages should be buffered inside P2P network and conveyed to users by mediators, other participants of the network. I looked over the Internet and found a Bitmessage protocol. Its based on Bitcoin protocol and implements P2P serverless instant messaging. Each node in Bitmessage network receives all messages and attempts to decrypt them using own private key. To solve scalability issues network is split automatically into multiple clusters (called streams). It allows to keep network traffic and CPU consumption within acceptable threshold.<p>1. Am I using the right protocol to implement P2P offline messaging on iOS/Android?
2. Can I estimate network and CPU load that will occur on mobile device?
3. Is it possible to receive and decrypt Bitmessage data on iOS while application is in background?",1384380849

It&#x27;s not just learning Redis - it&#x27;s learning _your Redis_.<p>All of the configuration details, deployment procedures, setup, integration with other services, data model, etc specific to your company. This can be a killer for small companies, where everyone needs to know a little bit about everything...<p>- Future-proofing: the greater the number of different technologies used, the higher likelihood of future driver / server / runtime / etc incompatibility issue. A future release of Cassandra which has a mission-critical feature for your business, but the CQL drivers that support it all require a later version of Node than your background workers currently run. Unfortunately, if you upgrade to a later version of Node then your Redis driver won&#x27;t work because it hasn&#x27;t been updated to support the past 6 months of Node releases due to breaking changes Node.JS introduced into a critical security update and ad nauseam...<p>There will always be a level of this even in a tightly integrated stack, but you&#x27;re setting yourself up for more frequent headaches the greater the number of technologies you have to maintain in parallel.<p>- Operational complexity: beyond the basic stuff like service outages, there&#x27;s dealing with less catastrophic but more frequent ops such as monitoring and configuration management. While there are a number of great generic solutions for monitoring the health of processes, services, and VMs, there&#x27;s a level of requisite application monitoring that needs to be deployed for each service too. Need to monitor the query plans and cache hits for PostGREs, the JMX metrics for any JVM application, compaction and read/write latency for Cassandra, etc...<p>Setting up that level of monitoring and _actually using it_ on a day-to-day basis for a large number of different platforms is expensive and cumbersome. If you&#x27;re Facebook, it may not be a big cost to manage. If you&#x27;re a 6-person engineering team at a startup, it&#x27;s a bitch.<p>Great article!",1384380183
6728936,comment,6728486,6728486,5,0,mindcrime,,,"I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t read TFA, and I&#x27;m not sure I want to.  The Semantic Web has hardly failed - tons of people <i>use</i> the Semantic Web everyday and just don&#x27;t know it.  The thing is, the SW isn&#x27;t necessarily <i>meant</i> to be something that the average end user knows about and uses explicitly.  It&#x27;s just about making it easier for machines to understand semantics around data on the web, so those machines can do a better job of helping the humans do whatever it is they are trying to do.  So Google could be using the Semantic Web behind the scenes all day long, and the end user would never know it.<p>And yes, Google do use the Semantic Web.[1][3] So does Yahoo.[2][3]  Etc.[3]<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter that some people use RDFa, others use microdata, others use microformats, others use RDF/XML, others use JSON-LD or whatever.  That&#x27;s irrelevant syntactical details.  The point is having explicitly defined semantics associated with things.<p>Anyway, the Semantic Web is becoming more and more important with every passing day.  As tools[4] for automating the process of extracting rich semantics from unstructured data mature and become better and more widely available, the number of applications for explicit semantics is just going to mushroom.<p>Just to illustrate (and forgive me a bit of what might be seen as self-promotion here) - our Enterprise Social Network product, Quoddy, has Stanbol integration such that we can process all the various bits of &quot;stuff&quot; that flow through the system, do semantic concept extraction, and store those entities and relationships in a triplestore.   Our Information Discovery Platform, Neddick, does the same thing as we consume RSS feed data, Tweets, Emails, etc.  Now we can do things like show you, for, say, a given status update, the blog posts, emails, tweets, people, documents, etc, that are conceptually related.  And while end-user use of &quot;semantic queries&quot; might not seem useful to some people, the bottom line is that this enables searches that you just can&#x27;t do with &quot;regular&quot; (that is, non-semantic) tech.<p>An example...  let&#x27;s say you do something with musicians.  Your ESN status update messages occasionally mention, say, Jon Bon Jovi, Bob Marley, Richard Marx, and Madonna.   How would you do a search without SW tech that says &quot;show me all posts that mention musicians&quot;?  Not gonna happen.  But with the semantic extraction + triplestore, we can make that kind of query trivial.<p>It gets better though...  Stanbol comes &quot;out of the box&quot; with the ability to dereference entities that are in DBPedia and other knowledge bases, which is cool enough in it&#x27;s own right... but you can also easily add <i>local</i> knowledge and your own custom enhancement engines.  So now entities that are meaningful only in your local domain (part numbers, SKUs, customer numbers, employee ID numbers, whatever) can be semantically interlinked and queried as part of the overall knowledge graph.<p>Hell, I&#x27;d go so far as to say that Apache Stanbol (along with OpenNLP and a few related projects... UIMA, Clerezza, etc.) may just be the most important open source project around right now.  And nobody has heard of it.  Again, the Semantic Web is largely not something that the average end user needs to know or think about.  But they&#x27;ll benefit from the capabilities that semantic tech brings to the table.<p><rant-over /><p>[1]: <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/99170?hl=en&ref_topic=1088472"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/99170?hl=en&ref...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/searchmonkey-support-rdfa-enabled-7458.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/searchmonkey-support-rd...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2011/06/02/microdata-rdfa-google-bing-yahoo-semantic-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2011/06/02/microdata-rdfa-g...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://stanbol.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stanbol.apache.org/</a>",1384380183

I&#x27;m going off memory here as I didn&#x27;t work across all the apps, but it looked like this:<p>1. a single-page Javascript app (Angular, CoffeeScript, Nginx, static site)<p>2. a web service to accept the contracts (Ruby, Sinatra)<p>3. a web service to pre-process the contracts and queue them for insertion into the legacy system (Ruby, Grape, Amazon RDS)<p>4. a service to de-queue the contracts and insert them into the Windows-based legacy system (.NET, SQL Server, IIS)<p>There were many, many advantages to this structure:<p>* each individual component[1] was trivial to understand - in the order of hundreds of lines of functional code<p>* we could choose the technology appropriate to the job<p>* we only had to use Windows for the bit that interfaced with the legacy system[2]<p>* the only technology choices that spanned the entire stack were HTTPS and UTF-8<p>* status of each individual component was available through HTTP requests; most made RSS feeds of their activity available for monitoring<p>* we could easily experiment with new technologies as they emerged, without changing or breaking All The Things<p>Some caveats:<p>* we had a highly skilled dev team, with experience across a wide range of technologies and platforms<p>* &#x27;the business&#x27; understood what we were doing, and why - in fact, the whole purpose of the project was to transform our previously monolithic architecture in this way<p>* log collection (using Splunk) allowed us to track the progress of individual contracts through the system, and alerted us when one stalled (e.g. was being rejected due to formatting issues)<p>[1] Except for the last one, because of the ludicrous complexity introduced by interfacing with the legacy system.  But all of it <i>except</i> for the legacy interop was easily grasped.<p>[2] Not knocking .NET or C# here; both are pretty good these days.  But the Windows ecosystem is just not as developer-friendly as *NIX.",1384380092

6728916,comment,6728417,6728670,5,0,azakai,,,"I see your point, but that&#x27;s a bit harsh.<p>First of all, having a github profile doesn&#x27;t mean you &quot;don&#x27;t want to spend evenings with friends and family&quot;. It means you spent <i>some</i> amount of time doing stuff on github. Ignoring people who get paid to write code that is on github (most open source projects are mirrored there now, so there are quite a few), all it means is that coding is one of your hobbies.<p>Aside from quality time with your family, perhaps you spend a few hours a week playing the guitar, or reading epic fantasy novels, or playing soccer, or perhaps you spend some of that time hacking for fun. Some very good hackers are exactly so good because they love hacking on software so much. Not all - some just want to forget code outside of work, that&#x27;s cool too - but certainly some. More than the opposite, in my experience.<p>Again, I see your point - to just categorically reject people without a github profile is both insane and immoral (insane, because you are going to lose out on a lot of talent; immoral, because it sends a message that unpaid work is necessary).<p>But I would say that a github profile is a positive. Aside from showing an honest love of hacking, it also provides code samples that you as a possible employer can just look at.",1384380059

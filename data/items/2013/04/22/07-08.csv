As you very well know we've been living in a Microsoft world for the past 20 years</i>), but accessible only to a few of us computer nerds. They're locking it down, but making it accessible to more people. People who previously despised computers and hated working with them and often couldn't use them very effectively. Now, they still despise them, but at least are less frustrated when using computers, and are able to do more with their devices.<p>I find your line of thinking a bit selfish. It's like arguing why car engines are nowadays sealed - <i>we can't even tweak our own cars easily - cars that we have PAID MONEY! How will the next generation learn about car engines and be able to tweak stuff if he wants to? They have to bring the car in to an authorized repair shop that's been approved by GM and pay them lots of money while previously we used to do it ourselves at no cost.</i><p>Not everyone has to know how to repair a car engine, or a refrigerator, or how to compile a program from the source. What's wrong with that?<p>In other words, I don't give a fuck about my profession. My profession is to serve the humanity. If Apple is making the lives of millions of people easier by making my profession harder or obsolete, so be it. Now, if you are arguing that what Apple is doing is harmful to humanity in the long run, that <i>could</i> be a valid argument that's worth having. But arguing that Apple is an unethical company just because it makes our profession harder (regardless of whether it's good for the rest of the world), I think that's <i>not</i> a valid argument. I think it's selfish and disagree with it.",1366617579

There's no migration path from Reader to G+ (presuming that's what you mean by ""the closed system""). There's not even a clear correspondence between the content in each, and meanwhile Google <i>does</i> provide a migration path to other RSS readers.<p>I think there is a clear argument for Google consolidating around APIs and their social network instead of federated protocols in the future. However, the whole ""strategy to kill off RSS"" thing is silly and undermines the other arguments you're making.<p>The bittorrent and gopher comments were facetious. It's not at all clear that all browsers should have a button that appears when a page has an RSS feed and, when pressed, opens a <i>different</i> web page to then enter the address of that RSS feed into your reader. Zawinski's Law was not meant as praise.<p>The lack of that RSS button is no more evidence of trying to kill RSS than the lack of gopher support is evidence of Google's plot to make sure that Gopher will never rise again like a phoenix and supplant the World Wide Web once and for all. Instead, you make sure extensions are able to build that button for those that want it (or put an option to enable it in about:config) and you call it a day.",1366616997

How is this a ""dirty trick"" as stated in the headline? And attacking the customers of your direct competitor in a funny way is also not dirty.<p>2) Paying bonuses to salespeople so they sell Samsung over Apple - if you know the whole story you are also aware that the iPhone heavily benefited from carrier subsidies during the years of its great success. iPhones were heavily subsidized to the detriment of Android/Blackberry devices and affected the carrier's profits greatly. See e.g. here:<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/08/technology/iphone_carrier_subsidy/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/08/technology/iphone_carrier_su...</a><p>3) Short position on Apple - The author even discounts this as likely false, and something like this would have to be disclosed in the books. Samsung is much smaller than Apple, especially when Apple had twice the market cap, so it is beyond me how they could have pulled this off without any proof.<p>That said, having read some things about Samsung's operations in general they are no saints, and probably employ ""more dirty"" tactics than Apple.

Used to be OK for getting apps, but now it is going to shove music and video search results in my face every chance it gets with annoying screens between me and the app search results and annoying continue shopping screens after each app.<p>If I wanted those things, I'd be in the other apps for them, like Google Books or whatever. Of course I'm never in that particular one because Amazon Kindle is so much better. I'm sure if I liked music or video then Google wouldn't be my choice either. I tried to get 300 once for someone and it had a search result for it, but wouldn't show me the page.

With Google you invest time in a product, then basically it gets shut down or co-opted into something you don't want.

Why?<p>To me, the obvious solution is to generate the palindromes, not iterate through every number and check if it is a palindrome. Unless generating palindromes is a very hard problem, iterating over them should be the obvious solution, as it obviously will mean a substantially smaller set of iterations.<p>As it happens, generating a series of palindromes is easy, and is <i>obviously massively faster</i>, since as a first crude approximation of the difference you can take his example program, change it to step through the space with ""step(10)"", convert to string, replace the last digit with the first and check that the resulting number still falls within the range, and then check if it's a palindrome. Just this crude change cuts the number of iterations required to 1/10th, and it hints strongly at the effects of recursively applying the same method.<p>Having to handle varying length palindromes slightly complicates matters, but not much.",1366615612

I read the article as stating that, even though you have final control, there are so many players and agenda's and sudden decisive moments, that you still only have a weak grasp on events.<p>In my opinion, awareness is key. Talk to your spouse and/or parents, primary physician and write stuff down. Make sure (like the mother in the story) that you Know you have a choice and that you and your supporters are able to voice that choice.",1366614255

Poor composition will kill the photograph regardless of how amazing your camera is.<p>If you're ever seeing something beautiful and wishing you brought a ""real"" camera with you while you actively ignore the camera phone in your pocket, you are engaging in the belief that it's the camera that takes the pictures.",1366614081

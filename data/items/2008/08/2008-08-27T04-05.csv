287757,comment,287587,287642,0,0,evgen,,,"Another minor problem with the suggestions is that the equity being asked for is basically participating preferred.  I don't think you are going to get this from _anyone_ unless you are actually putting cold hard cash into the venture.  Founders usually don't end up with preferred stock, so I can't see an employee getting any; if you want to prevent dilution then work to keep the burn rate low so that you don't need to ask for as much money from investors and endeavor to increase the valuation of the company when it becomes necessary to seek investment.",1219810356

Image-based eye tracking needs to be real-time (so probably inherently low resolution these days), tracks objects that are an important part of the captured image (so you get like a much lower resolution mouse, because of the size of your eyes or pupils compared to the webcam resolution), and needs to compensate for errors so it needs a lot of redundancy in data to generate output (so decreasing the resolution even more).<p>Anyone working in computer vision can tell me if I'm right or wrong? I've been working in the area in some small projects, but they were extremely related to this eye-tracking stuff.",1219809911

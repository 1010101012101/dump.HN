But Monsanto's Bt crops are not necessarily F1 hybrids - the major beneficial trait is the engineered one, which is stable across generations. So with the Bt crops, they maintain the breeder-farmer relationship with licenses, because the biology doesn't require it anymore.",1365587986

The numbers are probably not even even the same order of magnitude.<p>Moreover, Google makes money from each mailing list (for example) by displaying ads.  The revenue that they bring in from each list is pretty small; the key to their income is the huge number of lists that they support.  So losing even 100 lists every week, I have to imagine, wouldn't put much of a dent in their income.<p>By contrast, the overhead and cost associated with hiring, training, paying (salary + benefits), and supporting an employee are pretty high, particularly when you're offering a commodity product competing with other commodity (and free) products.<p>From a user's perspective, it seems insane for Google to ignore the business opportunity associated with support.

After reading my comment again I realise that I sounded like a typical Git elitist - sorry about that.<p><i>I'll turn it around and ask why, for simple tasks, is the CLI any better than a GUI ignoring personal preferences?</i><p>For me, the main thing is speed: I can type much faster than I can navigate a cursor (tab completion helps). I recognise that some GUIs have keyboard shortcuts to speed things up, but then at some point you're using the keyboard enough to justify using a CLI. The other thing is that I don't find graphical representations of my changes helpful at all. I commit early, commit often, so the output of `git diff` generally doesn't need to be paginated. My feature branches are small so I can merge them without the need to see a commit/branch graph.<p>To be honest it's hard to answer that without ignoring personal preferences because really, that's all it boils down to.<p>I can definitely understand the want to use a GUI when you're doing complex adds or merges. spacemanaki is right in saying that doing this a lot probably indicates a problem with workflow, though.",1365587158

Saving/Hoarding: Keeping money/cash under the mattress - nobody else has the ability to ""spend"" the money in the mean time. Also called ""sinking funds"" by Keynes. This is money kept in a bank deposit. The important point is that you can, at any time, choose to ""stop saving"" the money and spend it. i.e. you keep the right to spend the money at any time. Nobody else can make use of it. It effectively is out of circulation until you choose to spend it.<p>2. Investment: Lending the money to someone else for a fixed term - you can't ask for the money back before the end of the fixed term. They can spend it on goods/services for that period of time after which they have to pay it back. The money stays ""in circulation"".<p>Absent fractional reserve banking, #2 is the only thing that can actually generate a real return. i.e. real, profitable, economic activity that makes people better off. Without FRB, a checking account cannot pay interest, because #1 cannot be used in any risk-free way to generate value.<p>For economic productivity, #2 is a good thing, #1 is a bad thing. The fact that everyone is trying to do #1 right now with US dollars and the like is what is considered to be the source of our current economic malaise (according to the economists that I agree with anyway). Fractional reserve banking, QE and the like to some extent lets money that is in category #1 be used for ""economic good"" in category #2 - effectively fooling the hoarders into ""investing"" their money.<p>Of course, bitcoin doesn't have fractional reserve banking - and pretty much by design seems to make it impossible for things in category 1 to be used as category 2. This is why the ""hoarding"" of bitcoins is considered to be deflationary.",1365586863

For example, let's consider two apps A and B.<p>A charges a $50 one-off fee and B charges a $20 recurring fee. Sure, A will grow exponentially and you will appear to be instantly profitable, but it's a risk.<p>Think of this - You take $50 from the customer only ONCE this means, for the next two years, you need to pay for his support from your pocket. More the customers, more the support needed and more you will end up burning your pocket.<p>The problem with exponential growth is that it becomes static after a while and this is when things will become ugly. It will be a difficult situation because you can't switch to charging your customers monthly, because you've already charged them once. You will have very few options left then.<p>I can't imagine supporting a million users through a support system that I'm paying off monthly, but from an income that isn't monthly.<p>I think the best way would be to charge the customer annually like $99/yr or something like that..<p>This is a good read:<p><a href=""http://justinmares.com/why-real-businesses-dont-charge-5month/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://justinmares.com/why-real-businesses-dont-charge-5mont...</a>",1365585129

Of course, this is a free service and Google can do whatever they want, but I would at least expect a way to get some kind of support (hell, I'm even ready to pay fot it)... or at least, some kind of email (even an automatic one) telling me what we did wrong (and I doubt that we did anything wrong as the mailing-list is moderated and we are only talking about yet another PHP framework).<p>HELP! How can I get in touch with someone at Google? How can we get by our mailing-list?",1365584573

Also, never underestimate the built in auto-correct of the human mind :) There will always be a market for expert-curated approaches, but sometimes it's just cheaper to algorithmically ""Crunch"" it. Sometimes RAIN MAN counting toothpicks is enough, but when you need Ramanujam... :D<p>Also, do keep in mind... this is 2 hrs worth of coding time late on a sunday night. I don't have a CS degree, just a utilitarian/curious programmer who sometimes is stupid enough not to realize how hard a problem I'm tackling. :) Someone better qualified can do a much better job. Sometimes  ""just good enough"" is good enough! :)",1365584497

Essentially the country's economic growth directly depends on it.<p>To accomplish that the government should control all fibre, all phone lines, and all cell towers. It should then re-sell access to these things to ISPs/telephone companies.<p>With this in place you might still buy your cable from Virgin and your mobile phone service from Orange, but Virgin and Orange would be renting space on the government's infrastructure to accomplish it.<p>Similar to the Network Rail model but less terrible.",1365584415

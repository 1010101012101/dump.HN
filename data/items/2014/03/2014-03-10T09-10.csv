We’re woefully unprepared for these risks when policymakers don’t even know what an ISP is. Time and time again we see appalling breaches of massive repositories of private information, and time and time again we see our politicians and corporate leaders stick their heads in the sand and ignore the root cause.<p>What’s needed is a new paradigm, where data aggregation is outlawed, and where decentralization and previously-fantastic cypherpunk ideas for cryptographic identity verification, blinded signatures, provably-anonymous digital cash systems, and the like become standard.<p>PCI or HIPAA compliance will simply never be enough. Where cryptography can be used to protect individual privacy while providing strong authentication, it must. Where it (yet) cannot, information decentralization is the only way to mitigate the inherent privacy risks. Unfortunately, I worry that a combination of policymakers’ lack of insight, corporate leaders’ pursuit of cost reduction, and “Big Data’s” (or, more aptly, “digital anal rapists’”) penchant for massive warehouses of private information will prevail and ensure the fundamental reforms we need will never see the light of day.",1394445513

Logic suggests that healthy body would make me more productive, so I spend 7 days a week in a gym (1 hour each morning, 4 days of free weights and 3 days of cardio) and I always research and tune my diet.

I&#x27;d messed around with routines from Men&#x27;s Health and other magazines at various times over the years and got nowhere at all. I&#x27;m now doing far less exercise than I did with those routines and am seeing real progress.<p>Stronglifts is a routine for beginners and the 5x5 three times a week soon gets too much as you start squatting heavier amounts - I had to drop to squatting once or twice a weeks once I started  squatting about 1x my own body weight (about 250 lb).<p>Based on personal experience alone I thoroughly recommend Stronglifts and Starting Strength as a good way to obtain good general fitness and to lose weight. Squatting and dead-lifting are whole body exercises that really do work the whole of you - it&#x27;s surprising how much your abs and glutes hurt after some squats.<p>A word of warning: you must start with light weights and work on doing each exercise properly - and I mean stupidly light to start with, start with just the bar if you are completely out of shape. If you try and start with impressive-looking heavy weights then you&#x27;ll be resting up with a bad back before you know it.",1394445188

7372040,comment,7371246,7371246,2,0,mcv,,,"Actually, I quit Magic: the Gathering exactly because of its pay-to-play and pay-to-win aspects. The deck-building is absolutely fun, but I didn&#x27;t want to keep sinking money into it. But I still love a friendly game with others.<p>I don&#x27;t think Clash of Clans is pay-to-play or pay-to-win. I don&#x27;t pay a dime and am perfectly able to play it quite effectively.<p>The real problem with many of these free &quot;social&quot; games, however, is that they&#x27;ve turned micromanagement into the actual game. Quite often, there&#x27;s very little strategic choice to be made, you just need to check in regularly to give new orders because you can&#x27;t queue your orders.<p>Back in the &#x27;90s, people used to complain about the micromanagement involved in many big games. Designing your empire in Civilization is fun, choosing spots for new cities it, selecting new research is, but managing every individual city and unit gets really tedious after a while.\nAnd for some reason, this modern genre of games has removed all interesting decisions from their games and turned the tedium itself into what the game is about. You can&#x27;t queue stuff, or at least not a lot, and you have to earn the privilege to avoid a small part of the tedium of micromanagement. Less micromanagement has become the reward for playing. And yet without it, there&#x27;s practically no game.<p>Clash of Clans is not remotely the worst in this; designing your defense and organizing your attacks are still interesting parts of the game. But without those, you&#x27;d get a game like Hay Day which has practically no recognizable game underneath all the tedium.<p>But all of these games, including Clash of Clans, eventually have to make money for their developers, and they do so by making the game less fun than it needs to be, and you can pay to skip the unfun parts. And some people are suspectible to that, and end up paying. And the real evil of it is that they prey on addictive tendencies to get a few people to pay a lot.<p>But in the end, the games are intentionally designed to be less fun than they could have been.",1394444721

Your suggested substitute does not learn the heating/cooling efficiency curves of your HVAC system, does not automatically change the temperature when you go to sleep and before you wake on an adaptive schedule just by (re-)training it a few times, and does not turn on the heat when it detects motion. Even manual scheduling doesn&#x27;t replicate what Nest does for you there; since Nest learns the efficiency of your system, it can calculate the number of minutes it must run to produce the desired temperature change, and turn on the system at the exact right time <i>before</i> you wake up to reach that temperature on time.<p>Nest can do all that out of the box, and it doesn&#x27;t cost $250 for a new one on eBay, where you&#x27;re quoting the rest of your prices from.

Tcl, at heart, will never be an OO language through and through, like Ruby or Smalltalk, but that doesn’t mean that an OO system for it is not a useful way of organizing larger Tcl systems. Indeed, Tcl’s syntax is flexible enough that it’s possible to write an OO system in Tcl itself, or, optimizing for speed, utilizing the extensive C API in order to create new commands. Over the years, a number of such systems have arisen, the most well-known being “Incr Tcl” (a play on the incr command, which is akin to += 1 in languages like C). However, none of these extensions was ever included with the standard Tcl distribution or somehow “blessed” as the official OO system for Tcl. This meant that a newcomer to Tcl wishing to organize their code according to OO principles had to pick a system to use from several competing options. And of course, newcomers are the least able to judge a complex feature like that in a language, making it a doubly stressful choice. Furthermore, even experienced Tcl programmers who wanted to share their code could not utilize an OO system if they wanted their code to work with just standard Tcl. Also, if their code had a dependancy on some OO system, it would require the user to download not only the extension in question, but the OO system it was built on, which, naturally, might conflict with whatever OO system the user had already selected! As of Tcl 8.6, thanks to the work of Donal Fellows, Tcl is finally integrating the building blocks of an OO system in the core itself, but this effort is probably something like 10 years too late.",1394444089

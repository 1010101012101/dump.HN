4440890,comment,4440143,4440143,12,0,dougmccune,,,"Can someone explain to me (like I'm 5) exactly what, besides the general concept of list scrolling with bounce-back to indicate end of list reached, it was that Samsung copied from the 7,469,381 patent? The Apple fans here get pissed when someone argues that Apple is trying to patent an obvious ""idea"" and they claim that the general idea of bounce-back scrolling isn't patented, but instead it's a very specific implementation. And yet I've never heard an explanation of what the technical details are that specifically are patented. I've tried reading the patent, but my head exploded.<p>So please, for the love of god, can someone explain the non obvious implementation details that were copied?<p>If I were to see someone use bounce-back scrolling, or if I saw it in a movie, or even if I heard someone explain the idea, I'd go off and code something up. My amateur implementation would use the general principles of inertia and physics. Is there a way to do that without violating this patent? Because I'm tired of people yelling about how the idea of intertial bounce-back scrolling isn't being patented, only a specific implementation is, and yet I have no idea how that's possible. If that's true I should be able to implement the same general idea without violating the patent, right? How?",1346101168

When you get a bunch of guys (mostly guys) with the same skill together in one place, they'll tend to start spouting machoisms to show off. Programmers will say things like, ""You don't really understand X until you can do <something I just learned to do>"" or ""You're not a REAL programmer until you <abandon some modern convenience in favor of the programming equivalent of stone knives>"" or whatever.<p>Ignore it. Programming is like any other skill, where mastering the fundamentals is the heart of it. There are a LOT of basic concepts---basic and composite data types and data structures, the difference between a thing and some kind of pointer to a thing, ways of repeating operations (looping or recursion), breaking big problems into small ones and building back up to the big, being aware of causes, symptoms, and cures for common errors (off-by-one bug, overflowing an int, testing floating point nums with equals, etc.)<p>What matters most is training these basic ideas into reflexes and learning to easily match combinations of these basics to most problems you encounter.<p>Learn the basics, then tackle lots of fairly simple, common programming tasks (google for sites that offer lots of programming exercises) until those basics become part of you. You should also work on ""fun"" projects of your own at the same time so it won't get boring. Forget the arcane and obscure features and techniques for a while. They won't make you a great programmer; mastery of the fundamentals will.",1346100981

They had already assumed a regime of handwashing. Moreover, Semmelweis himself was not content to lobby attendants to wash their hands. He was instead fixated on the idea of cadaverine particles, going so far as to invent new vectors for their creation in cases where no contact with dead bodies could have occurred.

There is no such thing as a universal ""usability"" metric, and everything is relative to the site and its goals and use cases. For About, those statistics are exactly what you would expect if the site is doing its job well.<p>The use case for About is you have a specific question, and you find a page that answers it. If the page actually answers your question (i.e., the site is doing its job), then you will have no need to view other pages, so your bounce rate will look high. If it answers the question succinctly and efficiently, your time spend on that page will be low. And if your problem is actually solved, you won't have to come back. And lo, that is actually what we see.<p>If About isn't doing its job, then there are two common ""failure"" scenarios. The first is they spend a bunch of time on the site, trying to find the info they're looking for. The second is that they exit the site and go back to Google. The first failure scenario has a higher ""usability"" score that the success scenario; the second failure scenario actually looks pretty much identical to the success scenario. Google could distinguish between the two by seeing whether users come back or not; you didn't provide that data, so I can't tell.<p>About.com is not a content site the same way as a news site or a blog. If you judge it by metrics suited for such a site, it will appear lacking. If you judge it by its own goal, it might actually be succeeding (but you need more data to tell for sure).",1346099292

Every idea I throw into Google Traffic Estimator, shows me extremely low 'daily clicks', even when I set a Max CPC of something insane, like $500.<p>Finally, after months of it shooting down every startup idea I had, I decided to do a sanity check.<p>I used to work for a company that sells a line of shaft encoders for motor position measurement.  This company is extremely profitable, employing 30 or so people, brand new building, etc.  Almost all of their sales are internet sales.<p>I told Google keyword to come up with a list of keywords for me, from their website.  The list included all the words I would have used, having worked there, I was very familiar with their product line.  Plus it found a bunch of other keywords that looked right to me, but that, being only a human, I had forgotten.<p>I took that list of 100 keywords, and fed it into Traffic Estimator with a Max CPC of $500, so I could see just how much traffic I could buy with those keywords, given an infinite budget.   I was informed that I would get 130 daily clicks for those 100 keywords.<p>Given any reasonable estimate of conversion rate, and given that their average product is less than $200. We know that 130 clicks is laughable.  Even with a conversion rate of 14%, which is 1800flowers type of conversion rate, you're still looking at daily revenue of only $3600.  That's only $1.3MM a year revenue, which for 30 employees, brand new building, etc., is laughably low.  Plus, I'm being extremely generous by saying average sale of $200 and conversion rate of 14%.  For my own projects, I feel uncomfortable planning for anything above 4% conversion.<p>So, this is actually encouraging to me, since even a very successful company, according to Google, shouldn't actually be able to generate sufficient income to survive.  That means all those ideas I rejected, can now be re-evaluated, but now that I distrust Traffic Estimator, I am casting around for ways to get my answers.<p>Google Traffic Estimator seemed like the right tool to do this sort of analysis.  Does anybody have any ideas how it failed me, and how I can use it effectively to sort through my ideas and work on the one that stands the greatest chance of success?",1346099183

That seems to be implied by the second two questions. I haven't found that accuracy actually matter that much; mostly what's important is nominal calories over time vs. weight/other health indicators over time. If the number's not technically accurate, I kind of don't care. All I know is I roughly ate so many calories, my weight changed by x amount, and I can walk x far without getting tired. Over time, I can have a pretty good guideline for the number of ""back of the box"" calories I should be eating to reach my targets (which addresses your first question of ""what range to target"")<p>You mention explicitly that most people won't do it over the long term, which is <i>definitely</i> relevant. But even doing it for a little while can give you a good baseline so you can at least make educated guesses as to what you're eating, which is especially helpful in the ""food truck burger"" scenario.<p>I guess my point is that we all agree knowing roughly how many calories you're eating is good, but the only way I know to figure that out is to, at least for a while, literally count them.

Way back in the 1970s, I saw a television news magazine report about a group of nutrition researchers who found human volunteer subjects who were willing to be shut away from their normal life for weeks (months?) at a time (being paid for their time, as I recall) in conditions under which EVERYTHING the subjects ate was weighed to the nearest gram. The TV report even showed researchers washing crumbs off plates with distilled water so that the subjects ate every morsel of their measured meals. That was part of a study designed to elicit new information about human nutrition. Alas, I've never heard of results of that study. (Probably, the sample size was too small to have adequate statistical power to reach any firm conclusions.) This will always be the problem with human nutrition studies: people think they remember how much they eat, but often enough they don't really remember in detail, and the usual study methodology for a nutrition study is to rely on subject self-reports. If the sample size is extremely large, sometimes there is enough statistical power to pick up a few tantalizing signals from masses of carefully gathered data, but then there is still the whole issue of how well actual human beings apply advice based on the studies that have been done to date.<p>I am amazed at how much day-by-day obesity in very young people I now see in my town. I never imagined that most Americas in my generation or the younger generation would be as bulky as they now are. And the United States isn't even at the top of the world league tables in obesity. People all around the world today have eating tendencies based on human beings evolving in conditions of food scarcity, but there are fewer and fewer places each decade that still suffer from food scarcity. (Ethiopia is still poor, but it is now a food-exporting country.) The challenge for humankind in the remaining years of my life will be learning how to do what is ""unnatural"" and eat less than what is readily available to eat.",1346098016

Most consents in most institutions for years have had the clause that research results wouldn't be returned. Part of this is that research is, well, <i>research</i>. So you never know what you're going to find and it's usually very speculative, full of hand-wavey equivocations. Sometimes it's just not practical to re-contact people. Even in cases where it is, the research team is very often not in a position to offer primary medical care, so now you're burdening a doctor with test results they didn't ask for and might not be able to interpret. Finally, research usually doesn't employ the very strict guidelines that are in place for clinical diagnostics (since these limit how fast you can analyze data and push the envelope). Tubes can get mixed up, results can be just above the level of noise. All that is par for the course in research because you're supposed to be on the bleeding edge (well no excuse for tube mix-ups, but I digress...).<p>Returning results has the potential to add overhead to a research study, and for some, might make the entire study cost prohibitive (if genetic counselors and specialty care docs have to be on hand to interpret results for patients).

For example, while health insurers can't discriminate on the basis of genetic tests, I'm pretty certain life insurers can.

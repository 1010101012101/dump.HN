78035,comment,77962,77962,0,0,pg,,,"It might give some investors cold feet.  But I don't think startup founders should let the state of the economy be a deciding factor in what they do.  It has much less effect on the outcome than how hard you work, or how carefully you hire, or how much attention you pay to the design of your site.",1194656354

78032,comment,77995,77995,0,0,henning,,,"Mm, so what I understand is that Google has duplicate content detection to punish people who do this kind of thing.<p>However! If you have a high-ranking site and you scrape from a low-ranking site, Google might index you first and think the originating site was stealing ""your"" content!<p>And then there's the fact that it wouldn't be hard to replace words with synonyms, chopping up multiple articles, etc. so that Google probably wouldn't detect it. This is what spammers do.",1194655523

It is a true (they don't even try hiding it there) oligarchy, and has most organized crime in the world, which unsurprisingly leads to the perfect ecosystem for malicious hackers.",1194653668

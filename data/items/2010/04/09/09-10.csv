You would be far better off finagling your way into a job in an early stage startup, seeing what's going on and getting experience in a company without lots of structure and procedure. See spencerfry's take on what even  someone who's not overwhelmingly technical can do in a startup[0]<p>2. If you do an MBA, do an accelerated one [1],[2]. If you're considering changing because you've plateaued in your professional growth you may just need a change of area and that's where MBAs are good, but if you have a Masters already you've spent enough damned time in college without doing more than is absolutely necessary.<p>3. UChicago has a CS Masters that I believe is more welcoming to students who don't fit the traditional profile for people wanting to do CS.

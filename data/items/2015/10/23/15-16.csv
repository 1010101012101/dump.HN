Demonstrably so.<p>Computers in cars may make them more dangerous. But this is far outweighed by the greater <i>overall</i> safety in the cars that have them. You can&#x27;t buy an otherwise modern car with no computer control, so your choice is either to buy a modern car <i>with</i> computers, or buy an old car without them. If you&#x27;re avoiding computers then you&#x27;re buying an old car, and the result is greatly <i>decreased</i> safety.<p>This is typical human risk management, of course. The mostly imaginary scenario where your ECU goes nuts and causes you to crash helplessly into a concrete barrier is assigned great importance, where the sadly common scenario of some drunk or texting (or drunk texting) idiot killing you in an accident that modern safety design would have allowed you to walk away from is assigned very little importance.<p>It&#x27;s much like people who are afraid of flying but are happy to drive, because the thought of plummeting to their death from 30,000 feet is much more vivid than the thought of being randomly run over by a tractor trailer even though the latter is much more likely.",1445615954

If they hadn&#x27;t, Uber would be out of business and we&#x27;d only have taxis.<p>> <i>maybe next SV-backed startup decides to ignore FDA? Because who cares about those &quot;clinical trials&quot;, they&#x27;re only slowing progress down.</i><p>Maybe they will? If a company can reliably produce safe drugs without FDA trials, why wouldn&#x27;t we want that? Right now we have expensive drugs that are very safe. Few people die because they got a drug that was manufactured incorrectly (presumably, I don&#x27;t know the actual statistics), but many people die because they can never afford the drug in the first place. Maybe without the trials more people would die from bad drugs, but more would live because they&#x27;d have access to cures that were previously out of reach. I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s a question worth asking. There&#x27;s also the issue of the black market created by the high prices caused by FDA trials, where drugs are sold from shady online pharmacies and manufacture under who-knows-what conditions. Desperate people will take risks like that when they have no options.<p>If you were poor and contracted some rare disease where the treatment costs $100,000, but only has a .0001% chance of complications, would you rather die because you can&#x27;t afford it, or try a $100 treatment that has a 1% chance of complications? Right now you don&#x27;t even get the choice. For whatever reason we&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s better for people to die because they&#x27;re poor than for them to die because of a manufacturing / clinical problem with a drug. If that&#x27;s what we all think, that&#x27;s fine, but we should be aware we&#x27;re making that choice.<p>> <i>As a customer, I benefited from local company that offered pay-for-distance drive-by-GPS service stirring up the taxi market. They had some legal battles, there was a law adjustment, and the local market improved</i><p>The fact that they had &quot;some legal battles&quot; and the laws was changed, implies to me that they were also operating in defiance of the law at the beginning. How is that different from what Uber does? Besides, now you have the taxis, your preferred company, and Uber as options. With your recommended strategy of &quot;everybody obey the taxi laws&quot;, you would only have the taxis. Aren&#x27;t you better off this way?",1445615937

Is it Bank of America losing its shirt in Detroit? Or is it Greece failing to pay its debt? Or is is it Glencore overleveraged on commodities? Maybe it&#x27;s China devaluing!<p>The only common denominator, in my experience, is not to try your best to be the first. The first is usually a computer, and that trend is only growing.<p>What you want to do, and this is a time honored principle, is to really <i>think</i> about what you want to say, before you say it, and make sure you know the unique aspects of what you&#x27;re saying. Paul Tudor, like most AAA people, is hammered every second with the main-line thinking. His attention is only piqued with things that are oblique to the mainstream view. (notice that I use the word &quot;oblique&quot;, not necessarily &quot;orthogonal&quot;, because there are many unsubtle people who take the idea too far ie: &quot;I want attention so will go wild with my thinking&quot;. You must never underestimate the extent to which high end people have seen it all before and have defences against charlatans). Your best bet is to be really honest with yourself, about what you&#x27;re saying that&#x27;s <i>different</i> but not crazy, make sure you can back up your claims, at least intellectually (the market often does not have time for proof), and make that the key point of your piece, upfront in the subject line/headline.<p>Then, be prepared to defend your standpoint, with credible arguments. No sloppiness allowed. Your 10 seconds turned into 5 minutes! Don&#x27;t screw them up by not knowing your facts.",1445615447

So the decision has been (by Edge and Blink [Chrome, Opera], at least) that instead of vendor prefixes browsers should use experimental flags (that are off by default) and unprefixed CSS.

A strictly local physical description can only involve classical Newtonian pictures, such that all of the nonlocal effects are superadded onto these pictures and were elegantly explained away by Newton as such: &quot;Hypothesis non fingo&quot; -- in other words, &quot;Hehe, your guess is as good as mine&quot;.<p>In modern times, when we observe nonlocal effects between objects (such as with gravity), we first measure the effect, and only later do we invent something called a &quot;field&quot; whose definition consists of nothing other than the observed measurements themselves.<p>This is still nothing other than the same &quot;Hypothesis non fingo&quot; as before, except that now, the question of whether fields can possibly be explained in terms of classical physical pictures does not exist anywhere in the entire physics profession.  That is, those kinds of hand-waving, natural language questions just don&#x27;t have any place in the discourse of those who can rightfully be called credentialed, working physicists.<p>To such physicists, a particle is simply a set of quantum numbers that exists in n-dimensional Hilbert space (or &quot;mathspace&quot;). Again, whatever field is said to exist at the particle&#x27;s location is nothing more than the measurement that is recorded by some apparatus that exists in [classical] spacetime.  So, it is of course necessarily true that the particle and the [part of the] field [that affected it] must exist at the same location.<p>But to then say that this is therefore a meaningful account of something called &quot;local physics&quot; is, IMO, fairly absurd, because the entire point of the inventions called fields is to say: &quot;Hey, I have no idea what accounts for instantaneous, space-bridging forces like gravity, so I am just going to leave it to the philosophers to offer up speculations so that the masses may be entertained.&quot;<p>Of course, this can be countered by the argument that gravity is fundamentally different from the electromagnetic force, because electromagnetism necessarily depends on the supposed propagation of things called photons.  But this argument depends crucially on the notion that our mathematical shorthand for the quantization of the EM field (ie, photons) is at the same time a meaningful physical description that exists in the framework of a classical spacetime picture that is based fundamentally on the quality of locality.<p>However, QED (quantum electrodynamics; the quantum description of electromagnetism) in no way exists in any such classical framework. It is all rather the very same &quot;mathspace&quot; previously mentioned.  The &quot;field&quot; is nothing but whatever bit of data that some classical measuring device recorded there.<p>p.s.

Globalization has brought down developer prices, but the quality dropped too far below what was needed.<p>How can we reduce costs without having to pay market rates? We&#x27;ll hire someone with less experience than a college graduate in the field of web development!<p>Since most websites are nothing that difficult to implement, we can offer courses on teaching people basically how to build these apps, and then hire them at these companies! The employee is happy to be making more than they were (which was either nothing because their previous job has become irrelevant or less because the floor for software development is so high), and the employer is happy to be employing cheap labor.<p>My guess is the net effect can only be negative. If the business scales, it will need more talented engineers to help with that scale, and either keep these boot camp engineers to do the simple tasks or fire them for failing to continue to provide value. Or the business can&#x27;t scale because the developers aren&#x27;t talented enough to scale these apps, and they can&#x27;t hire talented engineers because they refuse to pay market rates for quality workers. The third scenario I see is that it becomes a Mythical Man-month problem, where companies just decide that high quality engineers at these types of businesses simply aren&#x27;t worth it, and would rather have a cadre of low cost boot campers, making the demand for quality software engineers drop, save for a few specialized roles.",1445612898

As student you might have little understanding.  That&#x27;s why you are studying!<p>In my case, initial downloads were readings for my courses or papers referenced in handouts.  I just let my curiousity guide me from there.  But I&#x27;ll admit I also had some background knowledge to begin with, gleaned from work experience.<p>In some (most) scientific discplines, every paper begins by citing background material.  You should gather and save those papers.  No matter how old.<p>When you read the more general papers, and the other background material, in chronological order, you are in a better position to understand more specific, recent work.<p>Basically you are building a foundation for understanding the current state of research in a subject area.  At least you will always be able to get up to speed more easily by having the proper foundation.<p>Of course, when you&#x27;re at university you may be busy with other pursuits and you may not have the time nor inclination to read all those older papers.  This is what you download and save.  Sometimes there are scientific &quot;encyclopedias&quot; or other compilations.  These can be good in their own right and also a further source for references pointing to more worthy downloads.<p>When in doubt a general rule is to download papers that are highly cited.<p>There is a vast amount of general knowledge that will never be offered on Wikipedia.[1]  It is the best kind: peer-reviewed.  Wikipedia and clones (Knol, etc.) wanted or tried to become &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; sources but this idea has never really succceeded on the open web. That is why this issue with academic publishing will continue to simmer.<p>1. At least, not until academic publishing undergos some changes.",1445612557

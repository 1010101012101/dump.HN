I would change ""credit card processor"" to ""payment gateway"" in the subhed on page 14 to match the language throughout the rest of the book.

Let's say AWS goes down.  1) You can't do anything about it, so while you're upset, you're not losing sleep driving to your colo and back at 3am.  2) Many, many other companies - some of whom are infinitely larger than you - are also down.

Somehow I didn't notice those words:<p>- I had conceptualized as my goal as <i>edit my OpenID</i> and was therefore seeking for it on the edit page, not the main profile page.<p>- The words ""New Login"" seem unrelated to my goal: I have <i>already</i> logged in, so I don't need to log in <i>again</i>.<p>- If I did notice those words, I surely interpreted them as another way to say ""Log out, so that someone else can log in with another name"". Many other sites have such links, and when you click them they take you to a new login page, which is just what this one does. It looks for all the world like you've logged out and have to log in again. Only if you <i>read the fine print</i> do you find out that the second page is for <i>logging in on top of your previous login</i>. Because in OpenID world you can log in six or seven times to the same site! How intuitive.",1255236406

In particular, the Banach-Tarski paradox is <i>false</i> in two dimensions.  (One technical reason for this is that you can embed a nonabelian free group into SO(3), the rotations on the sphere, but not into SO(2), the rotations on the circle.)  This means that you should not think of the Banach-Tarski paradox as being a Hilbert-hotel-like statement about a two dimensional lattice.",1255234824

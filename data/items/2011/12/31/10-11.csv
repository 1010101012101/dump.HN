Ideally we would scale up when the load demands it, but with the platform versioning issue unresolved we need to run our platform at ""full scale"" almost constantly (or scale manually which is a really bad idea when someone forgets to scale back up again for the weekend).<p>We're running in a WISC setup.",1325329191

Then you add in existing technical ego's from other teams and you just have a recipe for a stagnant crashing every month disaster. It's a generalization, but we all make them, it is how we make semi-informed decisions based on loose facts. Some large companies are wrongly maligned in the process but it's the reality.<p>When I took over the web at Marriott, we separated it from IT all together and made it a business division, in doing so we could make decisions independent of IT approval and we I had an independent budget under my discretion. Many companies just don't get how these slight organizational changes can make a huge difference in a teams ability to deliver technology.",1325329129
3410662,comment,3407777,3408645,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Very interesting. The main difference in our work is that we really latched on to VJ's idea of breadcrumbs and caching blocks. When I alluded to Bittorrent I wasn't really referring to FEC-based distribution. The problem with FEC is as you said somewhere else -- it's not very efficient for small files and it currently isn't very location aware (aside from Ono, my professor's research lab's Bittorrent plugin) so you can end up going halfway around the world for relevant pieces of the file.<p>Instead, we were more interested with the robust swarm implementations that were already present in some Bittorrent clients, like fairly efficient DHTs. It is also an already existing protocol with millions of users so we could piggyback on Bittorrent clients with plugins to measure the real performance all over the world.<p>The key difference is the caching. Jacobson proposes that the caching would happen in the ISPs, but there's no reason peers couldn't take up the slack, only different monetary incentives. The protocol here becomes less like OSPF and more like distributed k-minimum spanning tree. If you can find the ""supernodes"" then you can implement caching on their front and prevent unnecessary communication.<p>Of course, if you think anything like me your first thought is, ""do we actually know if data requests are reliably concentrated in a specific area such that local caching will actually provide much of a benefit?"" My partners thought the same thing, which is why they ended up doing a Bittorrent traffic analysis to attempt to plot an AS distribution curve for data requests[1]. They found that there was huge redundancy in intra-AS requests, so there's at least potential here.<p>Of course there are still a number of problems to be worked out -- if the supernodes don't have an easy incentive to provide caching to other people in their AS, how do we develop such an incentive? But the overall protocol seems very interesting. Most notably it would <i>not</i> work like FEC and small files would probably benefit even more from the caching (which is why you'll also note that files are split into blocks or datagrams or whatever you wish to call them in the VJ protocol).<p>[1] <a href=""http://acm.eecs.northwestern.edu/site_media/cccp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acm.eecs.northwestern.edu/site_media/cccp.pdf</a><p>I really don't deserve to be on this paper -- Zach and John really ran this show.",1325328934

It is a small, self-contained library which (I understand) does one thing very well. In any other language it would just be in the standard package repository. However, for some reason in C++, instead everyone wants to get into this one bundle of packages.<p>The problem is, because boost is monolithic, the temptation to developers is to start pulling in some boost::spirit, or boost::phoenix. I find these libraries fascinating from the point of view of what can be achieved in C++, but for day to day maintenance they cause serious problems.<p>The problem (which I could have better articulated) is that the messier, templated parts of boost end up being seen as 'best practice', or libraries that people should use. I wold much prefer something which lets me easily install just uuid, or boost::optional (another great tiny boost library).\nThere are of course various solutions. I could install a stripped-down boost, or just introduce strict coding standards.",1325328265

Ultimately you should also strive to understand what happens from the moment you type in the URL to the moment the page is displayed on the screen, so some understanding of DNS, basic routing, etc. You should also know how to use all the classic tools: ping, traceroute, host, dig, netcat, ngrep, nmap and so on and so forth, it will make it easier to understand the theoretical things and will very often come handy in practice. It's also a step towards another important goal - knowing your infrastructure, so probably UNIX, your web server of choice, your database server etc. You can go a long way by just reading the manuals and the user guides for those things.<p>Another aspect is knowing the modern browser well. You should learn some JavaScript, learn to use FireBug or Chrome Developer Tools, learn about the DOM, the security issues that the browsers have to deal with etc. Douglas Crockfords videos are a good way to learn this:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7664379246A246CB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7664379246A246CB</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5586336C26BDB324&feature=plcp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5586336C26BDB324&...</a><p>There is a nice book about web security from Michal Zalewski, a well-respected security researcher currently at Google:<p><a href=""http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/tangled/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/tangled/</a>",1325325976

I used to use function pointers and 'void *userData'. If I wanted to pass  additional data to the function then I have to allocate a structure and not forgetting to free it later which resulted in a lot of boilerplate code.",1325325796

At various stages, up to the 80s, a large segment of the population would have happily done away with the monarchy, which is unthinkable today. In a way, her constitutional profile as a weak ruler was a way to sneak the institution past turbulent times.<p>The next ruler will probably find himself, from the very beginning, more popular than powerful. The temptation to wrestle back some power from an unpopular political class will be strong, and there are very little safeguards. This wouldn't necessary be a bad thing: the UK system values pragmatism over principles, maybe restoring some royal privileges could be useful to get us out of the current ideological rut.",1325325688

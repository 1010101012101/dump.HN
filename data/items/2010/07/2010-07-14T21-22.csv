Landscapers, air-duct cleaners, carpet cleaners... we have a couple of clients that have owners pocketing 7 figures yearly.<p>What I find really interesting is how much the process these really successful owners use mirrors what we do in technology companies. They try different pitches. They test different call-answering tactics. They hone in on the words, phrases, and ideas that resonate with customers. They test different advertising metrics and are obsessed with tracking and analytics.<p>Once they understand how to close deals and what the best sources of leads are... they scale. For instance, one of our air-duct cleaning partners (that clears 7 figures in profit) has grown to four crews and a full time booking agent. The booking agent is extensively trained and closes 60-70% of all leads. The owner spends her time focused on quality control of the actual crews for the most part.<p>The point being: There is PLENTY of room for small business owners to make a lot of money with manageable levels of scale.

The predecessor of the chicken had a mutated female which laid an egg which embodied the modern day chicken. The egg gave birth to the chicken, and thus the species evolved.

1516053,comment,1514688,1515372,0,0,gxti,,,"Thanks for the reply.<p>Models may have fundamental value, but wisdom on model valuations is a little sparse at this point in history. Same for people in general -- there just aren't more than a few people (and I'm giving a benefit of a doubt that they exist at all) out there making a living by estimating the future earnings potential of an individual. Valuating corporations, on the other hand, is quite popular and there are many thousands of highly-paid analysts who sit around and talk about how much a company is worth, then sell that information to their clients. Actuaries are sort of in the same ballpark and society already frowns on them enough as it is, so while this might be a market ripe for the taking I suppose there needs to be a really compelling reason to pay for the service first. It would make more sense if one could purchase an individual -- I know I've seen Robin Hanson talk about the concept of a society where parents sell shares in the future earnings of their children to finance their education.<p>But for the moment, even if there were ""model analysts"" who published estimates on how much a model is worth, it would have little impact on their popularity. Models don't get popular because they have earning potential so much as the other way around. A model who is popular will command higher rates and more frequent appearances. If she is diagnosed with cancer and has 6 months to live then her potential is greatly diminished, but she can leverage it for charity purposes and get even higher rates. Valuation is interesting an academic sense, but for the time being it is a very useless thing to have in the fashion market. This effectively leaves the idea of a model's fundamental value even less tangible than that of a corporation.<p>Considering the extent to which bubbles form even with the possibility of valuation, the only way that a model popularity market could be analogous to an equity market is if it lives in a perpetual bubble, effectively negating the relevance of the fundamental value. ""Reckoning"" in the equity markets might be rare, but it does in fact happen. The career of a model, on the other hand, has zero empirical effect by their fundamental value.",1279143695

There is some conjunction (eg. Sports Illustrated), but there's an availability bias -- most of the fashion models you or I are aware of are the ones who are culturally relevant outside the fashion world (mostly for being really hot).  The value of a Maxim model comes from how sexually attractive she is to men.  They'll mostly be shorter, healthier and have bigger breasts.  Maxim models are also subject to the cultural whims of their audience and their variable loci of attractiveness, not all of them defined by purely physical factors -- Danica Patrick or Hillary Duff, while I certainly wouldn't kick them out of bed, in a cultural vacuum of pure adolescent horniness, would not be in the same league as Miranda Kerr.<p>Fashion models are frames for hanging art.  A weird, angular face may be an important component in the look of a piece of clothing.  Art also undeniably interacts with the personal character it's associated with.  With most art, that's only in the creator, but I'd imagine that in fashion modeling, most of the spectators who care will perceive a piece of clothing and the character of a show by the composition of the personalities of the models in it.  In high-fashion, anyways, where I'd imagine, like in the highest-level in any field, distinction is tuned down to subtle details that neophytes wouldn't even notice: it is crudely and fundamentally complementary to a fashion show or line to be shown off on somebody attractive; but when you get up there in talent, every detail, including the model, must be tuned to some creative harmony, and that value is not at all captured in the sexual attractiveness of a model by herself.<p>[again, disclaimer: I actually have no idea what I'm talking about.

Then get the hell out of the tar pit you're in and figure out how to spend more of your time doing that.<p>I build tools and frameworks.  I do a lot of other stuff incidental to that, and often the ""incidentals"" are what other people hire and pay me for.

I want to build Back End Code, for any of several fun definitions of that.  I especially love building stuff that enables other developers.<p>I also want to use Good Tools that make me feel good, and that build results that feel solid when I use them.<p>There are a lot of other factors -- algorithms, platforms, languages, performance.

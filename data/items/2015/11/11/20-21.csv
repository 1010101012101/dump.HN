At least at my company I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s definitely the prevailing reason why many of us are here.  The biggest drawback at a game company by comparison is that when if you have a great idea of how to fix something you&#x27;re usually under NDA and cannot help any of your friends elsewhere in the industry.  At the engine company your tools help thousands of studios do things better, and solving problems for one studio typically means bugfixes for problems other studios may have as well.<p>I dunno, that&#x27;s just kinda what it&#x27;s like in comparison.",1447275544

The vagueness and subjectivity of many obligations under the legislation leave businesses in an almost impossible position.  And most citizens have no idea what benefits the legislation bestows on them because it is so complicated and philosophical.  The regime has been in place since 1995 and since that time the average Jo, Jean, Juan and Johannes have all had their &#x27;privacy&#x27; massively eroded, however you define that term.  The one benefit it was meant to have was harmonisation to make the single market work, but that hasn&#x27;t really worked either.  Frankly, it is a complete sham and failure.<p>Whilst the single market is powerful force for good, it is continually under attack from this sort of well-intentioned but barmy &#x27;social&#x27; protection initiative.

That&#x27;s for cryptographic primitives, not any old RNG. However, there are downsides for using <i>trivially</i> predictable RNGs. A randomized algorithm might degrade performance with carefully-crafted inputs. This may expose you to DOS attacks. Hashes are a better known issue, where several languages have moved to make hashing less predictable, and thus less game-able.<p>It would surely be better for an implementation to avoid exposing any of this altogether, but an RNG intended for general use should have the worst-case scenario in mind.<p>The reason not to go full-on cryptographic is simply that the alternatives are faster and have more features. A list of some of the cool stuff PCG has is on the front-page, but here goes:<p>It&#x27;s extremely fast, pretty much the best non-cryptographic RNG out there distribution wise, of those tested, and a tiny dependency. The RNG is reproducible and supports multiple streams, including streams dependent on the address space. This also allows emulating Haskell&#x27;s RNG splitting (where one RNG creates two new independent ones), which is neat if you don&#x27;t want to share state between multiple parts of your program but still want global reproducibility, or even if you&#x27;re just a functional programmer. You can skip it backwards and forwards, which is little used but a ton of help when you do want it. Each instantiated RNG is a few bytes big. Something like the Mersenne Twister is a bad thing to instantiate wildly, especially on memory-constrained systems. Not a massive issue, but it&#x27;s still silly <i>any</i> RNG fails at this. Last but certainly not least, it&#x27;s a tiny dependency.",1447275496

The top 3 richest people on the planet at this point made their money themselves, and 2 of them (Gates & Buffett) are not going to pass their wealth down the family tree.<p>@Natsu, my point of contention is the very liberal definition of &quot;self-made&quot; and &quot;made their money themselves&quot;. If you give every reader on HN a trust fund, and a few start successful companies, would these individuals be considered &quot;self-made&quot;?<p>I don&#x27;t think so. Self made means start with zero net worth. That means no trust funds, no loans at 0% from parents with infinite payback periods, and no parent board members making absurdly lucrative deals that you&#x27;d never get otherwise. Just money you&#x27;ve made from your own labor, and loans you&#x27;ve received without nepotism. You&#x27;d be surprised how few entrepreneurs fall under this category.<p>If you don&#x27;t restrict your definition in this way, then every rich person is self made, because the interest accruing in their trust fund happened during their lifetimes.",1447275077

We are a Gold VIP on Aliexpress ($4,000 in sales every 90 days to maintain this level; we do about $1.5-2K/month average on there.)<p>If you read the reviews of products on Aliexpress, you&#x27;ll see reviews in just about every language--English, French, Russian, etc. In fact, very few of the reviews are from Chinese customers. Ali is most definitely a platform (two different platforms, actually, with Aliexpress and Alibaba) for China to sell to the rest of the world. Not necessarily for China to sell to China.<p>2) They&#x27;d need some sort of huge fulfillment centers a la Amazon.<p>The genius of the Aliexpress business model is that it works like eBay (Alibaba I&#x27;d more likely compare to LinkedIn, as it&#x27;s even less centralized.) Sellers fulfill orders themselves, post tracking numbers, and live chat/message with buyers to complete the loop. Some sellers take Alipay, which is the Paypal to Aliexpress&#x27;s eBay. Others take Paypal, wire transfers, etc. There is absolutely no gigantic warehouse needed by Alibaba.<p>All of these assumptions that he guessed so wrong on could have easily been disproven by ordering a few $2 items off Aliexpress and having them shipped to his house to see how the business model works.

I want the service first and since it makes sense to access those services from my phone or tablet, I get the app.<p>I don&#x27;t just go looking for apps randomly because I feel like (outside of games) there is a limited set of things I want to be able to do on my cell phone.

10549103,comment,10544975,10548245,0,0,smacktoward,,,"You can really read the entire history of Europe from roughly 1800 to today as one long struggle to answer the &quot;German question&quot; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Question"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Question</a>): should there be a unified state for German people, instead of having them scattered across lots of tiny, independent principalities? And if the answer to that is &quot;yes,&quot; where do you draw the lines of that state&#x27;s borders?<p>It was a central question to the politics of the age, for the simple reason that it was always obvious that by gathering so much of the continent&#x27;s population under a single flag a unified German state would immediately become one of Europe&#x27;s most powerful. Until the rise of German nationalism (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_nationalism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_nationalism</a>), the largest and most powerful state in Europe had been France, and Napoleon had tapped that power to make the French the masters of the continent. A unified German state would be large enough to be a  counterweight to French power, or even eclipse it altogether. So the German question became the fulcrum on which power politics in Europe balanced.<p>Obviously the French, along with the rest of Germany&#x27;s neighbors, had an interest in keeping the boundaries of a German state as limited as it could be. But there were divisions of opinion within the Germanic world about how big a German state should be as well. The maximalist position was the &quot;big German solution&quot; (<i>Großdeutsche Lösung</i>), which advocated pulling all German-speaking people, including those in Austria, into the new state. Advocates of the competing &quot;little German solution&quot; (<i>Kleindeutsche Lösung</i>) were more modest; they simply proposed unifying the northern German states.<p>This argument reflected the division of power in the Germanic world itself, which was split between Prussia in the north and Austria in the south. Austria then was much larger than it is today, part of the enormous kingdom of the House of Hapsburg (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Monarchy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Monarchy</a>), so the Austrians tended to support the &quot;big solution&quot;, since it was assumed that if Austria was part of the German coalition it would dominate its smaller partners. For the same reason, the Prussians favored the &quot;little solution&quot;; <i>they</i> wanted to dominate the united Germany, and the only way they could do so was by keeping the Austrians out.<p>All of this got worked out in a series of wars and revolutions between 1848 and 1871, during which Prussia beat first Austria and then France soundly on the battlefield. These victories put the Prussians in the driver&#x27;s seat in terms of determining what a unified Germany would look like, and since the Prussians supported the &quot;little solution,&quot; that was the shape the new German Empire took.<p>As they had hoped, once Germany took the form they wanted, the Prussians more or less ran the Empire. But then came World War I, and Germany&#x27;s bloodletting and defeat in that war knocked the Prussians off their pedestal. That created a power vacuum, which was eventually filled by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi state. And unlike the Prussians, Hitler was very much a believer in the &quot;big German solution&quot; -- so much so that his &quot;Greater Germany&quot; encompassed more people than even the most strident 19th century German nationalists imagined.<p>One of the arguments for the &quot;little solution&quot; had always been that making Germany too big would unite the rest of Europe in an effort to cut it down to size, as had happened to the French during the Napoleonic era; and Hitler&#x27;s wild expansion proved that was the case. And once the war was over and &quot;Greater Germany&quot; had been conclusively defeated, those nations (or rather the United States and Soviet Union, who had been drawn into the issue because Hitler&#x27;s ambitions were so large that they had spilled over the boundaries of Europe altogether) moved conclusively to split Germany into two states so it could not amass enough power to threaten the peace again.<p>That was how things were until 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed and with it its East German puppet government. West and East Germany then moved to reunite, and since nobody in the NATO coalition had any objections, the modern German state was born. This was a &quot;little solution&quot; Germany; the war and its aftermath had taken the shine off the idea of bringing all Germans everywhere together by force of arms. But when the European Union began to come together, this &quot;little Germany&quot; was still plenty big enough to dominate that confederation, especially with the UK staying out. So we reach the modern age, in which Germany is the unquestioned leader in European politics -- though only as long as the EU remains the form in which those politics are expressed, which isn&#x27;t anything like a sure thing.",1447274289

Hence you had poor blacks in Reconstruction being oppressed by the KKK (largely composed of poor white sharecroppers), who were being oppressed by the Northern bourgeoisie, who were being oppressed by Gilded Age industrialists who were being oppressed by populist politicians who were allied with the poor white sharecroppers.  That&#x27;s why you may have a monarchy with strong support from the common people: the monarchy keeps wealthy business owners in line, which keeps them from oppressing ordinary citizens.  It also explains the current political situation in the U.S, where the Republican party is an uneasy coalition of wealthy plutocrats, small business owners, and poor rural religious whites, while the Democratic party is an uneasy coalition of academics, white Yuppies, unionized black factory workers, and immigrant Hispanics.  The plutocrats oppress the yuppies, who offend the small business owners, who oppress the immigrants, who take jobs away from the rural poor, who discriminate against blacks.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIlJ8ZCs4jY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIlJ8ZCs4jY</a>",1447273980

But there has never been anything resembling Germany, rather Germany and Germans were defined by culture and by language. That&#x27;s why Kafka could have had this mixed identity of being German (he wrote in German after all), Jewish and Czech.<p>Following the napoleonic wars, nationalistic movements started to emerge in Europe, which, naturally, were opposed by the individual rulers of all the small states within the cultural area of Germany. Two separate ideas were discussed: the &quot;kleindeutsche&quot; or small solution and the &quot;großdeutsche&quot; or large solution, the latter including also the Austrian empire. There were two issues with the latter. Prussia and Austria were the two dominant states within the German cultural area. Austria, however, was a giant multicultural and multiethnic state with its own separatist movements. So when Bismarck pushed for unification, his aim was mostly to have Prussia gain power, not to cater to romantic ideas of pan-germanism. To achieve this, he had to keep his main potential rivals, the Austrians, at bay, and actually even fought the Austrians in the second of three unification wars (in 1866). So in a sense, the Anschluss was a step back to the &quot;großdeutsche&quot; solution, not some inconceivable invasion of a militarily inferior power.<p>In the 140 years since the first German unification, Austrians and contemporary Germany have separated culturally quite a lot; but still, at least in the sphere of culture such as literature, music and the arts, Germany, Austria and German-speaking Switzerland are treated similarly.<p>Disclaimer: IANAH and wrote it up in less than ten mminutes",1447273817

Little attempt was made to make it faster or use less memory. That said, the author recently communicated to me an idea to make it use orders of magnitude less memory. Instead of running all the context models in one pass while storing all their states, one could run each model in a separate pass, so that only the memory for one context model needs to be stored at any point in time. Since the original program was not multithreaded, this does not affect the running time.

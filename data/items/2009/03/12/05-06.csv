513077,comment,511908,512463,0,0,hedgehog,,,"Not exactly. The general term for the system that captures your first page is ""captive portal"". The short version is they intercept your first Internet-bound web request and send you a HTTP redirect to their login site. Once you give the portal whatever it needs to authorize you the local firewall is configured to allow your traffic out.<p>Generally captive portals will leave your DNS alone. They don't really have a lot of choice about this: if they poison your name cache you won't be able to get to your home page. Windows used to (still may) hold on to names for a minimum period regardless of TTL. A fair number of laptops have custom DNS. Combine those two and you can almost always get correct recursive DNS and frequently UDP 53 out.",1236837322

513062,comment,512801,512940,0,0,ynd,,,"Down-voters, he is also right.<p>It's common for dynamic languages to embed typing information in pointers as an optimization. For example, CLISP uses at least 2 bits to distinguish between common types. That way fixnum numbers can be recognized and added without slow memory accesses.<p>The result is that you get less bits for the address. Hence less addressable memory.",1236836090

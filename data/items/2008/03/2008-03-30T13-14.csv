150081,comment,149887,149887,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I was thinking the other day that there must be some ideal homogeneity level of a social news site. If homogeneity was zero, then there would be nothing separating news.yc from every other community in existence: 4chan, or the catholic church, or rec.food.drink.tea, etc. But if the homogeneity was one, that is if the community were perfectly homogeneous, then clearly no one would get any value out of that either.<p>The only reason I mention it is that you can actually kind of measure this. If news.yc was perfectly homogeneous, then the new page and the front page would be exactly the same. So you can measure the percent homogeneity by dividing 25 by the number of new submissions since the oldest item on the front page. I would bet that there is some ideal number.",1206884419

I do suspect that's going to be as hard to change as it is to quantify, however.<p>I think that this is partly, because a lot of the truly great content has already been posted.  Hacker and geek culture is really a small town once you get over the big learning curve.    There are only so many PG essays, Greenspun essays, Spolsky articles, Jargon file content, <i>The Cathedral and the Bazzar</i>, <i>In the Beginning Was the Command Line</i>, PMarca blogs etc..  that can be posted. After the bulk of these got posted, the early adopters started having to work harder to find content that was as good.  As they say, the low hanging fruit is easiest to pick.<p>I know that this has been true for myself, at least.  I put a lot of hard work into finding great content and posting it on Hacker News.  But, the well for me is running dry.  It's harder to come across articles/essays/posts that are as good , because there are only so many great, game changing articles about hacking and startup life that have been written.<p>So, I've changed my focus from trying to post great articles, to trying to improve the quality of comments that I can post.   And, I'm spending more time getting through school so I can get to work on my startup instead of just reading about them.",1206884223

Any advice appreciated. Here's what we're thinking of:<p>1. Using Beautiful Soup for the actual parsing of pages<p>2. we're not sure what to use for the crawl itself :( We use Python and love it, but don't know if we need to create our own crawler or what the best route would be. Any advice on this would be good<p>3. I'd like to create a distributed crawler where we can replicate the crawler over EC2 instances, but not sure how to do this<p>Apologies if I should ask this elsewhere. I love this community and have passively read many of the articles and comments on here for a couple of months now<p>Any help or pointing in the right direction would be appreciated<p>John",1206883892

It all still falls within ""Hacker News"".<p>I think people may have formed an internal model about the sort of things they think appropriate for this (or any such site) and get concerned when a submitted article doesn't conform to this. I feel it occasionally on programming.reddit.com, sometimes there are articles there that seem to be on there purely because it mentions the word ""computer"" or ""internet"".<p>But to my surprise when I visited archive.org and pulled up the front page from just over a year ago I see:<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070221033032/http://news.ycombinator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20070221033032/http://news.ycombi...</a><p>There really isn't much change at all in the sort of articles being posted.<p>Out of curiosity, where will you go instead of HN?

With few exceptions. everything I've ever had or accomplished has been a result of hard work and perserverence (good thing I love what I do).<p>""represent the community at large""<p>Ha, if only it were true!  I often wonder if I'm the most contrary person here.  I've never ""audited"" my comments here, but I'd be willing to bet many of them were ""against the common grain"".<p>A little background: I have absolutely NO formal computer education.  I was a math major in a college without a computer science department.  I have written tens of thousands of original programs in many technologies in over 80 companies.  I don't fully understand social networking, or ad based revenue, but I do know how to build what users need.  I don't blog, facebook, twitter, instant message, or text.  I often worry that I don't fit in here, because I feel so different from the ""typical"" member, if there is such a thing.<p>My karma score is a direct result of participation, nothing else.  Anyone can do it.  I have no idea (nor do I care) if that score ""entitles"" me to anything.  I love it here.  I sit at my terminal from 12 to 16 hours 6 or 7 days per week.  Except for the few precious hours with friends and family, THIS is my social life.  Don't even have to get up to interact with other humans, alt-tab does it.<p>Yes, you are wildly speculating.

150067,comment,149932,149932,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Lambda functions and closures in C++. E-gads man! Wasn't the language complex enough already!<p>I have to say: I love it. C++ has always been my favorite language that I don't program in. It's like kung-fu for programmers. You can attack any problem. But most times we don't need kung-fu.<p>There's nothing like ""getting in the zone"" with a good C++ program. It's a thing of beauty. And if you're doing stuff that you have to use the tool, like writing drivers, low-level stuff, doing some ""break the rules"" programming, it's the best there is. I wrote a shell extender for windows many years ago in C++. I got to change the desktop and file system to work the way I wanted it to. Very neat stuff.<p>The sad fact is that most of the time you can make more money writing something with a much higher level language. And you can make it faster and adapt to the market faster. So C++ is a tougher language to use for startups, in my opinion (although it is still my favorite)<p>Can you imagine the trouble you can get into with macros, lambda functions, and unsafe pointers? How about throwing i some operator overloading? It's like a playground for nuclear weapons.",1206882347

Knowing who Pushkin is, on the other hand, serves as a tribal marking that signals that you're one of a group of people that have a certain outlook on life, namely one in which literature is important.<p>If you're hiring someone for your startup, that's probably not important to know, but if you're looking for someone to have a relatioship with it can be helpful.",1206882281

The obvious use is to watch TV and movies on it.  However, I remember other interesting research uses for projectors.<p>The first well-known one is a major part of a multi-touch display.  Of course, with OLEDs, it might be possible to make one without a projector--it just won't be as big.<p>Second, Johnny Lee, in addition to his Wii IR goggles, has previous projects, where he can detect the orientation of portable display surfaces (like a small board) by projecting gray codes.  He cheats a little by having photo sensors at the corners of the small board, but the idea is to be able to project onto any surface, and for the projects to 'follow' it, as you move it around.
<a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/thesis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/thesis/</a><p>As a curiosity, there was a paper on HN a long time ago about seeing the back of a card.  It used a projector to project patterns(gray codes again, I think), on the card, and a camera to read the reflection of the color off a book page facing the back of the card.  Doing this, they were able to reconstruct the image of the card.<p>Lastly, it doesn't have to be a projector of visible light.  If you had another 'channel' to project into your environment from your phone, you can probably detect what's out there<p>I personally want contact lenses that does augmented reality.  because one is in each eye, it should be possible to create the illusion of floating displays in the air.  That way, you can see it, an no one else would.",1206882159

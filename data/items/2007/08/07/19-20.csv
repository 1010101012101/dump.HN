40208,story,,,21,22,bluishgreen,"Startup Visas..?  ",,"I started a discussion here about how to get into proper visa status to start companies in the US. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3531"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3531</a><p>After much research I have concluded that the situation in the US is too grim.<p>For eg. It takes upto 8 years for certain nationals to get a residential visa. And in that time you are not supposed to change the big company job you are holding. If you do, the clock starts again. If you want a better idea follow this link: <a href=""http://immigrationvoice.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5&Itemid=47"" rel=""nofollow"">http://immigrationvoice.org/index.php?option=com_content&#38...</a><p>Anyway, the point of this post is that I wanted to point out that Canada is so much more welcoming. You get a residential visa without even having to hold a job in 1.5 years, and the process is deterministic. And once in Canada you can immediately incorporate. 3 years of staying in Canada will earn you a Canadian passport again by a deterministic process. Apart from nice health care, with the Canadian passport you can enter and exit US without having to apply for a visa.(This is important for me, since many of my friends are here.)<p>This recent post here about Vancouver is very encouraging. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40054"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40054</a><p>Silicon valley is the best as pg has pointed out in many of his essays. But it is hard for aliens to maintain visa status in the US. <p>I might not be seeing potential problems with Canada. If you understand things better, please leave a comment here.<p>Thanks,\nbluishgreen.\n",1186516678

We're simply tired of the same old bullshit repeated by thinking-impaired writers.<p>You can't have a ""crash"" if the stock marketed is not tied into the business. PlentyOfFish.com, my favorite example at the moment, does not need to worry -- directly -- about a stock market crash. Nor does he (it's one guy) need to worry about VC pulling out: he has no VC.<p>A stock market crash could hurt everyone, but that won't be caused by some ""overvaluation"" of Web 2.0 companies.<p>Folks, the worst thing that can happen here is that some people may have to get corporate jobs while they plan their next ventures.<p><i>Those who predict a Web 2.0 crash don't understand what happened the first time.</i>",1186515459

In addition to this, I was reading recently about companies who were using Facebook apps to advertise, you guessed it, other Facebook apps.  So funded startups pay these funded startups to advertise to Facebook users, who then start using the advertised app.  Would be perfectly acceptable, only to date this seems to be the only proven model for generating money from Facebook apps.  This is being described by investment circles in the midwest as a new age multi level marketing scheme.  That is, if the group you are talking to is gentlemanly.  The less gentlemanly circles are calling it a Ponzi scheme.",1186514415

When you've got ad-supported models that are over valued, you're even more vulnerable. <p>I don't think you can use the depression as any indication of what happens during a recession though. In recessions, it's possible to effectively shield oneself from a good deal of harm, whereas the depression came and found you.<p>I agree with you on the last para.

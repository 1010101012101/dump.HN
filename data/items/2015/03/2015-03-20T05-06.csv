Faster insulins are one of the big targets for use in insulin pumps, because they would make a closed-loop system much easier (less need to predict where blood glucose is going if you can just wait 10 minutes, measure a new value, and give a new bolus), but there are two difficulties: 1. Diffusion from subcutaneous tissue into the bloodstream depends mostly on the molar mass, and insulin monomers are quantized; diffusing half of a monomer would be faster, but it wouldn&#x27;t be useful.  2. People need to be able to &quot;unplug&quot; pumps from time to time without dying, and if ultra-ultrarapid insulins leave the body too fast the mere act of taking a long shower could become life-threatening.",1426830310

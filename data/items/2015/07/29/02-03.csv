9965922,comment,9946374,9947927,0,0,sogrady,,,"[Disclosure: I&#x27;m the author] No argument that up-front, perpetually licensed software is currently a huge, profitable business. Windows and Office alone, as acknowledged, generate essentially $44B by themselves. There are also profitable businesses that pursue the traditional perpetual license model - Palantir being perhaps the most notable example (although from conversations with employees there, they are increasingly being pushed towards alternative models).<p>But the point of the Software Paradox is not that companies are not currently and cannot in future make money from software, and that there are no exceptions to the rule, it&#x27;s that the trajectory broadly is not promising. Looking across a variety of software categories, from mobile to operating systems to infrastructure to tooling to consumer, the trendline is downward in terms of their up-front realizable revenue potential.<p>None of which should be taken to mean that software is going away. If anything it&#x27;s becoming more important, hence the use of paradox. But developers and companies seeking to monetize software should at least be aware of the market context which is that it&#x27;s becoming more difficult to make money from it the way that it was possible to even a few years ago. Even the lock-in mechanism, which is correctly cited as a method proven to monetize customers efficiently, is more easily replicated in services businesses (e.g. cloud) than it is in traditional on premise software, where open source has become both an expectation and a means of combatting lock-in.<p>If one looks at all of the available evidence and decides to proceed with a traditional software licensing approach in spite of the observable challenges, it is certainly not impossible for them to a) generate revenue and b) be profitable. But the degree of difficulty attached to this model has gone up considerably, and looks to only be getting worse. And this isn&#x27;t just an academic theory, it&#x27;s something I hear almost daily in conversations with vendors.",1438137725

I suspect that, even if the F-16 was on a practice instrument approach, the bottom of its performance envelope is significantly higher than the top of the Cessna 150&#x27;s. (According to the &#x27;pedia, maximum speed is 109kt and Vne is 140kt.)<p>See-and-avoid has been the first and more-or-less primary anti-collision system in aviation use, but if you&#x27;ve ever tried to cross a highway with high-speed oncoming traffic, you&#x27;ve probably already learned that there are limits to the human visual system. It&#x27;s just not built to do that sort of thing. No doubt keeping your head outside the cockpit does prevent a lot of crashes, but expecting it to have prevented any crash, much less this one, is too much of a reach.<p>Keep in mind that most animal&#x27;s visual systems are pretty good at picking up movement, but one of the signs that you are on a collision course with another vehicle is that it <i>isn&#x27;t moving</i> in you visual field.<p>From [1]: &quot;<i>[The University of Washington’s Autonomous Flight System Lab] came up with a novel way to [modeled the UAS collision risk], reasoning that the known behavior (and random collisions) of gas molecules could serve as a way to predict collision probabilities between VFR aircraft, including UAS. (PDF)[3] To test the hypothesis, they compared the gas-molecule data to actual midair collision data and found a remarkably good fit. This allows two conclusions: manned airplanes under VFR run into each other at about the same random rate as gas molecules do and that’s pretty strong statistical evidence that see and avoid doesn’t work. (Because of a variance between the gas data and actual midairs, the paper concluded that see and avoid might work 14 percent of the time, but a bit better during the past few years. Possibly for a reason.)</i>&quot;<p>By the way, [1] is an entertaining post with some information, while [2] is a paper from &#x27;stralia called, &quot;Limitations of the See-and-Avoid Principle&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.avweb.com/blogs/insider/Why-See-and-Avoid-Doesnt-Work-223680-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avweb.com/blogs/insider/Why-See-and-Avoid-Doesnt-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/259.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/259.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.aa.washington.edu/research/afsl/publications/lum_risk_for_uavs_2010_2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aa.washington.edu/research/afsl/publications/lum...</a><p>Ps.

9965909,comment,9962999,9964686,0,0,davexunit,,,">How well does Nix interact with inherently stateful things like databases?<p>This is a frequently asked question.  Nix/Guix do not interact with such files, and we make it a point to differentiate between stateful and stateless.  Nix and Guix manage the stateless, deterministic stuff, and system services or other mechanisms manage the stateful stuff.  For example, there&#x27;s a postgresql package in Guix, but installing it doesn&#x27;t create a db cluster in /var/lib, it just installs the binaries, docs, etc to the user&#x27;s package profile.  However, GuixSD, the distro built on Guix, comes with a postgresql system service that creates the system db cluster before launching the postgresql server.  In other words, stateful things are handled at a different layer than the packaging layer.<p>If a new version of an application requires a schema migration, then that would be something for a system service to perform with the updated binaries from the package manager.  You still need to take care to back up your databases, home directories, etc.",1438137327

My hope was that containerizing the builds would isolate any configuration problems, and that containerizing the deployed services would cut down on outages by permitting trivial rollbacks (say, by snapshotting all the service containers before each deploy and merely restoring them should a deployment fail). Of course, all of the above could be fixed by traditional means (e.g. rewriting the build system with a single, standard tool; streamlining the deployment process, etc.), but it seemed like Docker could solve 80% of the problems while easing the implementation of the proper solutions down the line.<p>Considering the above, do you still think Docker&#x27;s a poor fit for business that aren&#x27;t building hosting systems?

9965899,comment,9947237,9949271,0,0,jayrox,,,"My story is much like yours. My mother was a stay-at-home Mom. She made extra income by sitting for a few kids after school and during the summer. During the summers we spent everyday at the pool. Took swim lessons from as early as I can remember. Became a lifeguard at the same pool I grew up at when I turned 16 and came back every year until I was 22.<p>During my years as a guard, I had roughly 100 &quot;saves.&quot; Most were inner-city males, bused in a few times a month.<p>I&#x27;ll never forget my first save. Its one of the few I really honestly consider a save and not just proactively going in after someone before it became a real issue. It was around 7:45PM, the pool was about to close and people were starting to leave. She was about 3 years old carrying a beach ball larger than her above her head. A strong gust of wind blew the beach ball from her hands and into the deepend of the pool and she ran right after it and into the water. She went straight down to the bottom. I watched the whole thing happen in what seemed to be maybe 3 or 4 seconds. Soon as she went in, I went in after her. Pulled her out and got her to the side and  before her dad even realized what happened. I doubt she even realized what happened. Her dad couldn&#x27;t stop thanking me for saving his little girl.<p>My most terrifying save was on St. Rita&#x27;s Day, which is a school in Cincinnati for the Deaf. It was one of my first days guarding the pool and a deaf guy and his two deaf daughters went up a slide in the shallow end of the pool. When they got to their turn he put one girl in each arm and sat down. I tried and tried to whistle at them to get their attention. When I finally did it was too late and they had started going down the slide. No sooner did they leave the gated area did they fall over the side about 15 feet into 3 foot water. He landed standing and still holding onto the girls. I jumped in and rushed over to them. His arm had broken when he tried to grab the gate to prevent his fall. I didn&#x27;t know sign language at the time so I couldn&#x27;t really communicate with him which made the situation even worse. We were lucky though, we did have one girl who was pretty good and was able to talk to him, ask him and the girls if they were ok. The girls were fine but after his adrenaline had calmed a bit and we got him out of the water we noticed he had also broken one of his legs in the fall. As far as I am aware, that was the last St Rita&#x27;s day we had.<p>My son is now 3 and I have already started teaching him how to swim. I vow to never have to worry about him in the water.<p>My wife jokes about how I act near pools and bodies of water. Always scanning, always counting, always watching for signs of a weak swimmer and I always will. Its part of me.",1438137052

9965878,comment,9963994,9965525,0,0,mikekchar,,,"The thing that is very frustrating in the &quot;There was never time to change decisions...&quot; bit is that there often <i>is</i> time.<p>If you are curious about what I mean, I invite you to try a little experiment.  For a few weeks (2-4 should be sufficient) tell people, &quot;If you see something wrong with the design, refactor it as soon as you see it.  If you need some extra time on your story to compensate for that work, just bring it up at standup and we will modify the sprint commitment&quot;.<p>If your experience is like mine, you will find that the vast majority of people will <i>not</i> refactor the design at all.  About 10% of the people will try to refactor something, and will end up trying to rewrite the entire app.  They will do more damage than good and will probably give up half way through.  If you are lucky, maybe 5% will actually refactor something and be successful.<p>Because I have tried this many times, I&#x27;ve interviewed people and asked them why they do what they do.  For the people who don&#x27;t refactor, the reason they usually give is: &quot;There is no time to refactor&quot;.  Which is really odd because they have explicitly been given time.  What I have come to realize, though, is that people do not want time; they want absolution of responsibility.  If you ask them to make the judgement call, they do the math in their head (unconsciously) and determine that they will be rewarded more and criticised less if they do feature work without refactoring.  This forces the decision up to the PM/PGM/BM/BA/Whatever, for whom refactoring has no direct benefit.  The result is that refactoring is rarely done, and if it is done it is the result of a large political process.<p>For the people who try to rewrite everything, training seems to be the overwhelming issue.  They pull on a thread and the whole sweater comes apart.  For some people in this category, though, giving them carte blanche to decide what to do means that they feel they can finally &quot;do it right&quot;.  Doing it right in this context means that they can replace all the code that they didn&#x27;t personally write and therefore don&#x27;t like.  Since everyone on the team only writes a small portion of the code, it means that rewriting everybody else&#x27;s portion is basically rewriting the app.  Again, training seems to help because even if a person&#x27;s goal is to replace everything, if they learn how to do it piece by piece they can be successful.  Also if they do that, they will be required to have many coversations and may eventually learn how to work with others.<p>Finally, you may get one or two people who naturally know how to refactor well.  It is useful to find out who these people are and to encourage them.  Unfortunately, this often enrages the &quot;my way or the highway&quot; people.  The people who are good at refactoring, if encouraged, will naturally dominate the design of the application.  Often these people are suppressed by political means because they are so effective at driving the design.  In order to enable these people you will need to make some tough decisions on the business end of things.",1438136386

It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d expect if I didn&#x27;t know better, I&#x27;d expect to at least be able to get some shouts and screams off but it&#x27;s not actually like that.<p>In fact I was once swimming with the son of my dad&#x27;s best friend in his teens, we&#x27;d only seen each other once before as our parents lived in different countries after they married. And somehow he went deep into the sea, and at some point I looked back and saw him flapping about. I must&#x27;ve been 15 or so at the time but somehow even though he didn&#x27;t yell or scream, and even though we&#x27;d been pretty far from the beach for like a solid 5-10 minutes (giving me the impression he had no problem swimming), I got the impression he was drowning. I&#x27;m glad I responded, but looking back it felt awkward and it wasn&#x27;t a clear cut situation where you feel this heroic impulse. I didn&#x27;t know him very well, he was 2-3 years older than me and bigger, and he didn&#x27;t indicate to me he had issues swimming, maybe he was just playing around (just like my gf likes to lay in pools face down for like a minute at a time, which looks way more suspicious of drowning!), I really didn&#x27;t want to go up to him and hold him and find out he was totally fine, it&#x27;d just be really embarrassing, as if some kid a few years younger has to rescue him at sea. Either way despite him not yelling or anything, I did swim over and grabbed him and he started pushing me down violently as if I was a floatation device, so from there it was pretty clear, and we slowly made it back to the beach and he kept thanking me for years after everytime I see him. I tried to use the rescue techniques I&#x27;d learned as a child, to have someone float on your chest basically but that totally failed in the moment and I couldn&#x27;t create a moment of control to calm him down and instruct him, I just did my best to swim up and to the beach. He basically pushed me down every other second, and then I&#x27;d swim up and catch a breather as best as possible, and somehow we made it back like that. Totally exhausted and out of breath right after, can&#x27;t imagine how he must&#x27;ve felt.",1438135225

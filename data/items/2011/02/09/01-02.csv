Whereas Apple is creating a walled garden to lock in customers.<p>Sony eventually got commodotized in the very technology they created.  This won't happen with Apple.  At worst they get undercut in their industry, but Apple has a rich ecosystem that has to stay with Apple to reap the benefits.<p>And just for the record, no downvotes from me.",1297216774

Most schools hand out the traditional lesson plan books at the beginning of the year during faculty meetings and in-services. They are a pita to fill out and maintain and frequently change year to year if you are worth your salt<p>However, I believe your sales would increase dramatically were you to target administrators and department chairs instead of individual teachers. $20 per instructor is well within their annual budget and they are very open to ideas that make day-to-day operations smoother.<p>Making it possible for parents to view the lesson plans would enable you to engage entire districts without much difficulty.<p>Well done.",1297216660

Lower interest rates act as a signal that investors should go ahead and make investments. Saving represent deferred spending, not a persistence absence of spending.<p>However, in the government skewed markets of today where interest rates are forced artificially low these signals are not allowed to operate correctly and savers are penalized.<p>There is no ""excessive incentive"". People save when an incentive exists sure, but this represents future spending. At the moment there is little or no benefit to simple savings; why save when your money will be worth less over time? This is a result of not allowing interest rates to float with the market. Again, interest rates are manipulated by the government.<p>In the case where competition causes prices to decrease due to higher efficiency and quality, the money in your pocket becomes more valuable.

In addition to the previously mentioned errors, you need to think a little bit about what your benefit is to your customers. Consider telling a story instead of reciting bullet points - ""Company X wondered if their customers liked the new search page design. 15 minutes later, they knew, thanks to Poplytics. 10 minutes after that, the old design was restored."" I think you also need to do some research into what sort of needs your customers have, and position your benefit statements to address those needs. For example, you mention satisfying customers. That's probably a real need. But is it the most important one? What about ""answering those pesky questions the guy in marketing always asks"" or ""gather visitor's ideas about how to improve any page on your site?""<p>Finally, at first blush this does seem similar to KISSinsights.

In fact, the majority of the time the police seem to completely ignore them, even when they're purposely making a scene.  They know there's realistically nothing they can do, crazies will be crazy.",1297213429

Our competitors aren't taking our market share with devices; they are taking our market share with an entire ecosystem. This means we're going to have to decide how we either build, catalyse or join an ecosystem.</i><p>Please, please, Nokia, adopt Android and put your efforts into making great hardware to go with it, without ruining the interface like so many other manufacturers do.",1297213332

We used to call them letters, and they were powerful then too.<p>You can change a person's or a group's mind about something, even after a decision appears to have been made. You can clinch a job, win a contract, stop a lawsuit, regain a friend, woo a lover, and change history itself with just a few words.<p>I'm not sure if people realize quite how powerful an email can be, directed at the right audience, at the right time, with the right message. And the flip-side is true too. A badly written, poorly directed, or mis-timed email can have terrible consequences. You can make or break a company with a single email.<p>Regarding this memo, it's a truly inspiring, and well-timed. I think this will be a Gettysburg moment for the CEO, and may mark a turning point for Nokia.",1297213300

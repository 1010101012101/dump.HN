Then attempt library login attempts. In the event they are successful, the service contacts the user and warns them that they have a weak password.<p>Unfortunately this is so similar to standard phishing attacks that I'm afraid the good would be offset by the bad of reinforcing user behaviors that its ok to click through on 3rd party notices like this.",1238373669

One of the biggest giveaways that tell me a site has been developed exclusively on a Mac and probably not tested much on Windows is the fonts.<p>This is a pretty recent chart of font availabilities: <a href=""http://www.webspaceworks.com/resources/fonts-web-typography/48/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webspaceworks.com/resources/fonts-web-typography/...</a><p>From personal experience, stay away from Lucida. One of the most common fonts across all platforms is Arial. I usually recommend using this for your general copy font. The attempt to render Lucida looks really crappy on Windows if its missing, and you can never tell which computers have it and which ones don't. That being said, Lucida is a nice looking font when its available. If <i>you</i> are you looking to use Lucida, read below.<p>This is a solution that's been promoted for a couple years, font-family: ""Lucida Sans Unicode"", ""Lucida Grande"", Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;<p>It was talked about here: <a href=""http://www.brownbatterystudios.com/sixthings/2007/03/14/lucida-hybrid-the-grande-alternative/#comment-23011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brownbatterystudios.com/sixthings/2007/03/14/luci...</a>

The results might not have been pretty then but they even uglier now...<p>> The fed isn't a regulator of financial institutions. Instead, it is supposed to handle monetary issues.<p>Whatever its official duties, the Fed is considered a central bank. Centrals banks as a rule have been considered to have wide latitude for action on the economy in general, by policy makers, by their heads, by the financial community and by the public at large. Certainly, we can see the Fed taking wide action today.<p>Just consider - I'm sure you know the William McChesney Martin quote that the job of the Fed is ""to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going"". This means looking at the economy as a whole.<p>> Note that crashing the market (via raising interest rates) wasn't politically possible, and regulators only do what is politically possible.<p>This is indeed true. Politicians may sink to the point that they only follow immediate popular options. CEOs may lie, cheap and steal due their pathological greed. Doctor may do a bad job due to habitual incompetence. In each case, it might indeed be true that nothing was possible at the time that it happened. One nonetheless must point out what these people <i>ought</i> to have done, whether they really could have done it or not.<p>I would note that the rise Greenspanism/""market fundamentalism"" itself, starting in the 1990's, certainly made it much more politically difficult to stand against Wall Street's further partying in the 2000's.<p>> And, to the extent that bogus-type transactions were occurring, crashing the market wouldn't have stopped that. They'd have just gone down in proportion.<p>This is pure speculation on your part. I could equally speculate that they would have gone down as a proportion given that the total supply of loans was now down and honest deals are more desirable than dishonest deal. Further, actual bogus loans were only the final straw which broke the back of house price inflation. At wasn't the fundamental problem. We can see a huge number of ordinary loans which are coming undone at the moment (and without the massive intervention of the Fed, there would be even more).",1238372319

Your experience helps my isolated decision process.  I hope this threads runs further.<p>Particularly, I am wrestling with this:  My site is mostly text.  Typography is king here.  Its easy to make it look nice on OS X.  But both Firefox and IE6 on WinXP look like hell.  This is mostly a WinXP core fonts problem.  But the same font between Firefox and IE6 on WinXP looks different and I can't find an acceptable balance.  Let me add to that: I can't find any ""readable"" core font on WinXP.  What do you do?",1238371341

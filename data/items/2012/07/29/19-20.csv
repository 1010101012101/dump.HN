4309513,comment,4309177,4309456,9,0,jessriedel,,,"I think it's pretty complicated.  You haven't addressed several issues:<p>1) Craigslist may own text in the ads, but they don't own facts.  (Likewise, it's OK for me to tell Alice that Bob posted a poem on his window about cats so that she can go read it, even though it would not be kosher for me to make her a copy, and <i>even if Bob asked me not to tell her</i>.)  Padmapper don't use the full ad text, just the fact that the ad exists and discusses housing at a particular location.<p>2) Many (most?) would argue that, unlike physical property rights, intellectual property rights are only justified insofar as they are a net good for society.  I have a Lockean right to the shirt on my back regardless of whether or not there are laws to protect me, but my ability to get 20-year patents (and not 1-year patents or 100-year patents) persists at the pleasure of the legislature.  Likewise can be said for copyrights.  So even if Craigslist is in the right under the current law, that doesn't mean this situation couldn't be catalyst for good change, and that discussion of crappy UI is important (i.e. not a red herring).<p>3) Craigslist has monopolistic powers in this market; in the presence of competition, their crappy UI might be forced out of business.  One can justify open data requirements as an alternative way of reducing monopolistic powers to standard trust busting methods.<p>Not saying you're wrong, but I can't see why you'd want to put up a top-level comment with broad claims that doesn't address these and other issues raised in previous HN discussions.",1343591881

I don't have to be ""friend"" with someone to follow them.<p>Having signed up on Orkut in 2004, and used that social n/w quite regularly for ~ 4 years. People forget the beauty of Orkut. In someways they were ahead of times -<p>1. Privacy: Privacy settings were impeccable. In fact, it would notify you if someone visited your profile too. So no more ""stalking"". Believe it or not, Orkut never allowed search engines to index their pages.<p>2. Communities: Facebook groups are quite popular now. But still, Orkut communities in 2005 were better. They were malleable. You could turn them into forums/boards for discussion. Group announcements. Group Polls etc. And most importantly owners/mods  had ability to make any content public/private with simple switch.<p>3. Testimonials: LinkedIn started with this ""recommendations"" feature. But Orkut had ""testimonials"" since its beginning. It was fun reading testimonials once in a while.<p>4. Design: Orkut's design during initial years was the best any social network could have. Simple and clean!<p>5. Search: I've used majority of the social networks. Orkut's search engine was simply the best. It's search engine in 2005 could easily beat FB's search even today.<p>What led to Orkut's downfall? I've heard form Googlers that there was no strong internal support to Orkut. In 2008 they started copying FB and it became unusable since it had worst UX due to this. And last but not the least, Facebook's Feed. Feed was game-changer for FB and it's eventual growth.<p>Edit: Grammar",1343591859

The goodness and desirableness of Facebook happens despite this stuff rather than because of this stuff. Facebook has been a place where a lot of people like to come to chat with their friends (duh!). This kind of virtual tavern is something that a lot of people enjoy. But the problem is that Facebook has succeed so well at being that kind of place, that the limitations of being that kind of place are showing; suddenly realize you just own the nightclub, you're not the most popular person in the nightclub. And making grandiose statements on the nightclub loud speaker isn't going to make you more popular.<p>- Being the place where people talk to their friends does mean you can sell people anything (they don't come to buy but to chat).<p>- There are plenty of things that it's in people's better interests not to share and sooner or later they'll figure that out - when they do, they don't appreciate being previously mislead and get more closed about the entire medium (it's interesting how the telephone produced a lot of same ).<p>- And there are many reasons to step outside your circle of friends. And completely outside is both easier and safer than any conceivable ""multiple circles"" system.<p>Facebook's stuff lately has been butting-up against these limitation but not overcoming them. I don't know these can be directly overcome with the ""I will monetize my efforts"" approach and if they can't, it might be good.",1343591825

A lot of information is hiding behind that disclaimer.<p>That means that to get these 7 good questions, the writer might easily have asked 21 questions.<p>That means that where you are reading 1-3 paragraph answers, the original answer was easily  10 paragraphs, because people tend to ramble when you ask them about their jobs, even when they're NOT being interview by the NYT. (Here's an experiment for you: Ask a friend or colleague one of those questions, do not interrupt them, in fact appear very interested, and count how many minutes the answer takes to unspool.)<p>That means that when you're reading a nice orderly progression of thoughts, the writer probably had to take  bits and pieces from different answers because the interviewee thought of something later to append to the original answer, or emailed a clarification later, or reminded himself of something.<p>That means when you don't see words like ""uh"" and ""um"" and ""like"" and ""I mean"" and ""I think"" and ""you know?"", and when you don't see sentences that trail off into nothingness, and when you don't see run-on sentences, and when you don't see non sequiturs, that's because the writer has carefully removed them.<p>That means the writer doesn't mention that it took three hours, easily, to transcribe a 45 minute sit down, and more time for the follow up to clarify and fact check words that were mumbled or inaudible and not in the notes.<p>You don't want to call something like this ""sloppy"" unless you know what actually goes into it. You know how non-programmers often assume that very simple, easy-to-use software was similarly easy to make? How they don't think about the edge conditions that turn something that SEEMS like an easy two-week project into a three month project (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000356.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000356.html</a>)?

For example, Roger Penrose's stuff about physics and consciousness is a bit strange, and it probably wouldn't hurt if he cared more about existing work in philosophy of mind. And Hawking's most recent book has good science, and an interesting philosophical proposal of ""model-dependent realism"", but strangely refuses to consider it to be a philosophy proposal or discuss relevant existing positions.<p>Physicists veering off towards ""big-picture"" philosophy-ish stuff later in their careers isn't new, but this sort of seat-of-your-pants approach seems newer.

The book dedicates a long chapter to the great lengths taken with the Viking landers to avoid contamination problems.

It would be, essentially, something like usenet where you have a choice to ""brand"" every message you send with an identity - or not.

Nothing wrong with marketing, but the majority of developers, programmers, and engineers are sold on facts and not on copy. I'm not saying you are doing this, just stating my understanding of the subject.<p>>An interesting thing we discovered early on when building Zapier is that lots of companies have products that do one thing great, but could use some help in other areas. If your product can help that company do other things great and in turn help their customers be more awesome, then said company has a vested interest in promoting you.<p>This is called collaborative marketing. It doesn't work for competing products. Note that competing products does not refer to a product in the same industry as other. Might even be something completely different, yet competes for the same money. It is very hard to use collaborative marketing without dilluting your brand.<p>>Usually that means blog posts, announcements on email newsletters, mentions on twitter, and generally all that marketing voodoo that developers aren't nearly as good at when compared to writing code and making useful products.<p>Marketing is not voodoo. People who call marketing voodoo make other people think that it is hard. Marketing is pretty simple when you get down to the facts. It is about connecting prospective buyers with sellers. No voodoo with that. You mention utilizing written marketing tools, such as sales letter disguised as blog posts, newsletter and ""tweets"", but you don't mention what voodoo powers them. It is not voodoo, and its not even a secret. What powers those written marketing tools is one thing: Market knowledge. If you know who you are selling to, then selling becomes so much simpler. This also has to do with your line about ""...making useful products."" If you don't understand an industry well enough to sell something to it, then you won't build useful products. If a developers can build an useful product, then he/she can definitely market it as well.<p>>So the easy thing to do is pick out a company that likes to promote other services and aligns closely with the product you are building and make something that would be both useful to your customers and their customers.<p>Not so easy. Companies are not standing by waiting to promote their brand alongside yours. Companies do not like to promote other services, they like and well, only function to make money. If your product will make them money, guess what? You are leaving money on the table for them. These are predators. Not saying that it may not be useful for somebody out there, but experience has taught me that more is lost in these types of ""deals"".<p>>Keep in mind this isn't a magic strategy either. Sometimes getting a marketing or biz dev persons attention can be pretty tricky. Promoting 3rd party apps doesn't always get a lot of attention and tips@company_name.com isn't the most frequently checked email address.<p>It is tricky because they are focused on making money.<p>>Instead try getting a developers attention. Ask them a question about their API. Propose a new endpoint. Get a conversation going.<p>Basically find people who are naive and think marketing is voodoo.<p>>Then by the time your integration is good and ready you can simply ask the developer if they'd be willing to put you in touch with someone in charge of promoting 3rd party apps and usually they give you a nice warm juicy intro.<p>In my country this is called making the bed for someone else. By the time you are done with them they are already ""asleep"".<p>>Some places that are great to do integrations with are MailChimp or Google Marketplace.<p>Mailchimp is good for integrations because its a marketing channel.<p>>If you are interested in testing the integration waters with Zapier we'd be thrilled to have you as an integration partner.

These include jsPlumb, jsdiff, encryption algorithms, and more.<p>There are also other countless times that I have acted too quickly. Writing code to generate images to create rounded borders that are now handled natively via CSS's border-radius. Lots of jQuery functionality, ajax and more.<p>The point is, it really <i>does</i> help to procrastinate. It's not just lip service. I have extrapolated this to really move away from deadlines. All deadlines have either already passed or do not need to be met. I create no deadlines for myself. I leave to the universe more deadlines -- working on other people's schedules or those set by the weather.<p>I have found myself much more at peace. I live a better life now and am a lot happier since I stopped rushing through everything.

It allows you to solve a particular class of parallel problems (namely, those which require relatively infrequent communication) on multiple cores, but shared state is basically impossible and message passing is slow. It's a suitable tool for problems which are largely independent and where you can defer the problem of shared state to some other component, e.g. a database.

There is a lot of physics that suffers from ""bad metaphysics"" precisely because of its practitioners reinventing metaphysics, in the guise of ""interpretations"" of physics, when they are unaware of obvious problems that arise, which even a small amount of reading would've made them aware of. And there's a lot of work in artificial intelligence that makes more sense with a humanities background.<p>Oddly this seems to be a recent phenomenon. Early 20th century physicists were <i>very</i> well-read in philosophy, and their interpretations are accordingly sophisticated and rarely run into novice problems. Same with mathematicians; it's hard to even separate whether someone like Frege was a mathematician or philosopher. Some is unavoidable due to increasing specialization, but if anything that would seem to call for more humility, not extra arrogance that we know how to solve the philosophical problems that we don't time to study in as much depth as Einstein/Planck/Bohr/etc. did...<p>I'd trace some of it (on both sides) to a general academic tendency to want to rationalize why the fields you didn't specialize in and don't know about aren't that important to know about. There's an only half-joke that academics always want to reduce every field to their own: to an economist everything is analyzable with economic tools, to a sociologist everything is culture, to a physicist everything is physics and its minor epiphenomena, to a philosopher everything is philosophy plus implementation details, to a dynamical systems theorist everything is just instantiations of dynamical systems, etc.",1343588668

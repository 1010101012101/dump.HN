7729325,comment,7728781,7729214,16,0,krig,,,"You couldn&#x27;t possibly be more wrong. Comments that describe the code and not the intent are terrible for obvious and clear reasons: They are not checked by the compiler, and they are not checked at runtime. There are no assertions that flag when the comment has gone out of date. Comments that talk about what the implementation <i>does</i> are virtually guaranteed to be wrong. This is simple fact. The thing comments can do that code is less good at is express abstract intent, and they should be saved for that. However, more powerful and expressive languages can express much of that in code as well, and thus even such comments can often be removed.<p>Look. What is code, and what are comments? Code is stating some fact that is expressed in a well-defined grammar. It can be both 1) read by machines, and 2) read by humans. Code says something specific, and it has a specification or at least a reference implementation which describes the exact meaning of what the code says. Sure, it can be <i>wrong</i>, which simply means that it says something other than what the author intended, but what it says is well specified.<p>Comments, on the other hand, have no restrictions at all. They can be written in any language. They can be fragments of sentences or multiple paragraphs. If they do follow some structure, it is not enforced unless by some external tool, in which case the comment is, in fact, code as input to that tool, and the complexity of the program has increased by an order of magnitude as it is now written in multiple languages at once.<p>Comments are worse than useless and should always be seen as the last resort. Wherever there is a comment, there should be a language deficiency that prevented whatever needed to be said from being said in the language itself. If there is no such thing, and the comment merely states what the code already says in a well-defined manner, the comment is <i>wrong</i> and should be removed.",1399830989

7729319,comment,7726615,7727426,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> There is something unique in character to that Superbowl experience that is making it fundamentally more expensive to the world than other possible uses of bandwidth, and that needs to be modeled as a cost to <i>someone</i>.<p>If this was actually a problem there is a much better way to model it than metering: Sell different speeds at different times of the day. Instead of selling a connection which is allegedly 100Mbps all day and all night, sell a connection which is 1Mbps during peak hours and 100Mbps off peak. Then sell a more expensive connection which is 10Mbps during peak hours and 100Mbps off peak, etc.<p>This is a much better mapping to costs than metering because it takes into account the persistence of capacity expansions. With metered billing, the people who only tune in on Superbowl Sunday aren&#x27;t actually paying as much as their usage is requiring capacity to be expanded. Peak usage that day is higher than peak usage any other day so more capacity was needed just for the day, but once built it sticks. Just paying the “normal” metered pricing that day would let them off the hook for their contribution. But increasing the price to the accurate level, putting the whole capacity expansion cost onto that one day, could create such high prices that customers would revolt, and would probably make live streaming of popular events uneconomical. The better solution is to make the correct people pay (namely those who buy the plan with sufficient peak hours performance to play the stream), but pay by subscribing to a plan that spreads the cost out over the whole year and in exchange provides superior peak usage performance all year to those paying for the capacity expansion that allows it.<p>> The reason we don&#x27;t have horribly wasteful electronic devices is partly because they would cause electricity bills to go up for the people using them. If you had a washer/dryer that used a thousand times more electricity than other appliances you owned, or you had a holographic television that used a thousand times more electricity than a lightbulb does, you would start to limit how often you washed clothes and watched holovision, and this would be a good thing: it would lead to market incentives to create similar devices that used less electricity.<p>The incentive exists without metering. If you had a version of Netflix that used a thousand times more bandwidth than the existing one, you would need a connection which is a thousand times faster in order to use it. You can even get such a connection: Just pay AT&T or Level 3 to dig up the street in front of your house and install 10 or 100Gbps fiber just for you. They&#x27;ll do it for the right price, but that price is prohibitive for pretty much everyone. Which is why Netflix doesn&#x27;t even offer to stream uncompressed 4K 3D video at ~10Gbps per stream.<p>You&#x27;re also making the assumption that the price of metering would be high enough to have a significant deterrent effect on usage. But accurately priced metering probably wouldn&#x27;t. The significant majority of an ISP&#x27;s expenses are not strongly correlated with the amount of data transmitted. They&#x27;re paying  accounting, customer service, marketing, linemen to repair weather damage, property tax, electricity, etc. Even a significant proportion of expansion-related costs are uncorrelated with future consumption, because by the time you break ground to do any expansion whatsoever, the digging becomes a sunk cost and the cost to install 2X or even 10X as much fiber into the open hole is extremely modest. Expanding capacity by 500% can cost in the same ballpark as expanding capacity by 50%.<p>The marginal cost of increased usage that could be deterred by accurately priced metering, i.e. the cost to the provider of usage increasing by say 55% instead of 65% over the same period, is so small that trying to measure it isn&#x27;t even worth doing. It may even be zero – upgrading links from 1Gbps to 10Gbps gives you ten times as much capacity regardless of how much you actually needed.<p>The concept of trying to conserve bandwidth is the application of false analogies. It&#x27;s not like electricity; there is no generation cost. Bandwidth is use it or lose it. If you&#x27;re paying for a high speed plan and then not using it, that isn&#x27;t the fault of someone paying for a high speed plan who is using it. A single user using more than average costs nothing because it isn&#x27;t enough to require an overall capacity upgrade; only the average user increasing average usage does, and if that happens to a sufficient degree then all it means is the average user will have to pay a higher rate. People who don&#x27;t use as much and don&#x27;t want to pay as much can buy slower connections – but if it turns out that the actual cost of increased usage is a sufficiently small proportion of the cost of providing internet service that slower connections cost almost as much as faster connections, that&#x27;s hardly the fault of people who send more bits.",1399830896

It&#x27;s fallacy to assume they don&#x27;t exist, but they tend to be so rare and esoteric that you probably have a better chance of winning the lottery than finding one.<p>I have however, run into numerous bugs in standard libraries. These are definitely much more common in proprietary languages like ActionScript (Flash) or Lingo (Director), or rapidly-changing (I&#x27;ll be nice and not say poorly designed) languages like PHP than in say, C, C++ or Java. Platform-specific bugs in x-platform code also seem to be the most common.<p>I agree with the general premise that &quot;it&#x27;s probably your own fault&quot;. I can probably count more times that I&#x27;ve suspected a compiler/OS/stdlib bug and found after extensive testing that it was my own fault than I can count genuine library bugs. On average, I probably hit one genuine language bug every two years at most.<p>The trick is to start with the assumption that it <i>is</i> a compiler/OS/stdlib bug. Next, go create a minimal proof-of-concept to demonstrate the bug you believe exists. In doing so, more than 50% of the time you&#x27;ll figure out what was <i>really</i> wrong with your code as you are doing this. The other times, you have a nice minimal test case you can submit to the language maintainer&#x27;s mailing list.<p>It&#x27;s also surprising how much you can learn about how a language or feature by trying to methodically prove that it is broken. The process of doing so forces you to think about all the edge cases you don&#x27;t normally consider, but most of the time, the language designer already did.",1399828680

Doubly so for the diffstat: always great to see -bignum +smallnum.<p>Regarding the linked article about &quot;semantic highlighting&quot;, I&#x27;ve seen numerous complaints equating existing syntax highlighters to highlighting all the verbs in English prose, and &quot;why on Earth would you want to do that?&quot;.  <i>Code is not prose</i>; highlighting the verbs makes perfect sense given that code is a set of instructions.  A better analogy would be to a step-by-step instruction manual, and I&#x27;ve seen many instruction manuals that highlight the verbs in each step.",1399827788

One option that <i>might</i> work would be a special drawing mode implemented in the OS graphics stack that did some mapping depending on what&#x27;s configured in the accessibility settings; then applications could request that in the rare cases where it&#x27;s important.",1399827756

Haskell is generally a language that only makes sense if you buy the &quot;sufficiently smart compiler&quot; argument. Haskell&#x27;s abstractions shouldn&#x27;t carry a penalty, because the compiler compiles them out when it recognizes them.<p>That&#x27;s cute but while it&#x27;s impressive what it recognizes, it&#x27;s generally still stupid, and it will get beaten by bad programmers (especially by bad programmers. Becoming good at Haskell means, amongst other things, learning what the compiler will screw up).<p>Scheme, likewise, doesn&#x27;t have free abstractions. Unless you mean macros, but those are not really free either imho.<p>There&#x27;s one high-level language in wide use that has &quot;free&quot; abstractions, or at least, costs as low as possible, and that&#x27;s C++.",1399827740

What view did it advance?<p>Ok, I&#x27;ll answer the last one. It advanced a view that I hold a particular view.

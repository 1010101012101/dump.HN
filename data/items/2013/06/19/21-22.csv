5908647,comment,5905885,5907110,6,0,greghinch,,,"My anectodal observation is that these types of social programs tend to be much better received in countries other than the US. In the US, we&#x27;re all raised on the idea of earning everything you get, and dependence on government is equivalent to surrendering freedom. We&#x27;re also such a large and culturally diverse place that doesn&#x27;t have a very long history compared to many counties, so there is more of a sense of &quot;take what&#x27;s yours&quot; than &quot;we&#x27;re all in this together&quot;. This is a cultural bias which is hard ingrained in people (despite the clearly flawed fundamentals). Consequently, the same benevolent social programs that enjoy successes elsewhere tend to do poorly here.",1371679183

Out of 690?<p>I can&#x27;t tell from the <i>1HU front plate</i> of a <i>generic server</i> what it&#x27;s contents are. So maybe those were the only servers they could directly implicate in transmitting copyrighted stuff? But I&#x27;m not sure you can even make that distinction (load balancers, proxys, internal networking different from outside view, ..). The charges also included racketeering and other capital crimes, so I&#x27;d imagine they could have easily taken all of these servers on that charge alone.<p>Also, the way searches work here is that the people executing them are usually not involved in the actual investigation. They call it the <i>executive arm</i> for a reason. So they usually get a broad description of what to take (<i>servers</i>), and from whom (<i>Megaupload</i>) and then take everything they can find. Police here commonly confiscates <i>displays</i> when looking for hard disks.<p>Also, why did LeaseWeb not immediately re-assign after first non-payment? What was the bet here? That MegaUpload would be able to stave off capital charges on absolutely no capital at all (initially), spanning 5+ countries?<p>From what it looks like, these servers were tainted, and should have been taken in as evidence.<p>(Whats the connection here with <a href=""https://www.eff.org/cases/megaupload-data-seizure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/cases/megaupload-data-seizure</a> ?)",1371679174

Newspapers are the only media institutions that continually cover wide beats. They have a reporter in city hall whether or not something interesting is happening there, one in court, and one in Germany. This makes print reporters much more knowledgeable about their respective beats than other kinds of reporters, and that&#x27;s why most breaking stories originate in newspapers.\nTV, on the other hands, is usually a secondary news collection organization. It often lets the newspapers break a story before covering it themselves. This means that they can afford to send a reporter to Germany only when something interesting is going on there.<p>Newspapers have been able to support this model because their customers buy a package. They pay the same price every day because they have to buy the entire paper, though they are likely interested interested in a different story each time. This means that when there&#x27;s news in Iraq, people buy the paper for the Iraq story, and that day the Iraq reporter subsidizes the supreme court reporter.<p>But this model is a problem for online journalism, because revenue is generated only from the articles that are actually read, and obviously, a single article generates less revenue than a complete package.<p>Unfortunately, this would make it very hard to keep reporters on the ground that slowly get to know their beats and wait for something interesting to happen. Unless media comes up with a new way to support regular beat reporters, we will lose the most essential information-gathering mechanism we have, and the news will be even more controlled by PR than it is today (and even today a large portion of the news is spoon-fed to the few reporters left by PR firms).",1371678335

Some of them might scrape together enough capital to start a retail store. Prices and profits are going to take a long time to fall, so most of them will just keep doing what they&#x27;re doing, except with a little less risk, and they&#x27;ll be able to keep their cash in a bank, and theoretically pay taxes on it. If things reach the point where it&#x27;s not really profitable any more, then those people will have to get a real job.<p>The idea that they will turn to some other criminal pursuit...yeesh. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve never even met any dealers. Imagine that tomorrow, the government made your job illegal. Would you be like, &quot;Well, that does it. I guess I&#x27;d better start brushing up on my raping, murdering, and insider trading,&quot; or would you maybe not go all-out breaking whatever laws you could? It may shock you to realize that <i>because</i> the hypothetical dealer is breaking the law in one respect, he is best served by not breaking the law in any other respect, in order to not draw attention to himself.<p>Lastly, we don&#x27;t have to speculate what will happen, there are countries which have decriminalized drug use -- US states too.

No, because <i>no one uses it anymore</i> (sorry YUI users), and at a certain point you have to cut your losses.

Since data might arrive at any open connection, you&#x27;ll have to have at least one &quot;pending&quot; mp_read operation for every socket at all times. This quickly adds up in terms of memory usage: if you were to read into 64k-sized buffers (that&#x27;s somewhat arbirary - but using smaller buffers tends to be very bad for througput) youd need 625mb of memory for just these buffers alone to handle 10.000 connections. In a C10M scenario (<a href=""http://c10m.robertgraham.com/p/blog-page.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c10m.robertgraham.com/p/blog-page.html</a>) the same would need a staggering 625GB of memory.

Windows overlapped I/O has exactly the same problem (and so has that new RIO thing).<p>A better model would be to have a &quot;buffer pool&quot; that is kept reasonably full by the user-mode application.

But I don&#x27;t think a company like MS fully understands what it takes to provide a digital future that is an adequate replacement for physical media based games.<p>Valve has most or all of it figured out. Digital delivery. Easy downloads. <i>Lower prices</i>. Embracing indie games. Discounts on bulk purchases. And so forth.<p>Steam games have a lot of the same limitations that the xbox one would have had but you don&#x27;t see nearly as many people complaining about that. And that&#x27;s because of all of the things listed above.<p>There are tons of console games that I and many of my friends have grown to love which started off as borrowed games. And that&#x27;s, I think, how it should be, the same as books. I don&#x27;t think Steam is the perfect answer for all of time but the fact that you can acquire games at effectively used prices or lower (sometimes $15 or even $5 for a AAA title or even as little as one or two dollars for an indie game) significantly blunt the problems of reduced lending opportunities.<p>P.S. For clarity I&#x27;m saying that being allowed to lend and borrow games is a huge benefit to game makers because it is a very potent way of increasing the fan base. How many people borrowed someone else&#x27;s copy of Harry Potter and then went on to buy hardback copies of subsequent books as they came out and watched the movies and so forth? The same phenomenon works just as potently with games. There are several people I know who are fans of the Mass Effect series who might not have been if they couldn&#x27;t have borrowed the game that first time.<p>With art the best salesman is the thing itself. That&#x27;s how radio works. That&#x27;s how museums work. And libraries. How do you convince someone they like Manet or Picasso or The Fiery Furnaces or Gershwin or Raymond Chandler or HP Lovecraft or Katamari Damacy or The Last of Us? There is no possible way to adequately describe such works in words alone. The only possible way to determine if one likes such things is to experience it first hand. And that is why &quot;piracy&quot;, even in its most extreme forms, is never going to be as much of a threat to makers as some people believe. &quot;Consuming&quot; art makes fans, and fans with money will spend their money to acquire art by artists they enjoy, whether it&#x27;s games, concerts, movies, albums, and so forth.",1371677187

5908386,comment,5907732,5907732,77,0,kevinalexbrown,,,"This reminds me about how important it is to have a solid lawyer, and an understanding of the legal ecosystem. Even in cases like this with typos, &quot;respond in ten (10) days&quot; can be quite intimidating, especially when there&#x27;s a money/legal power asymmetry.<p>In one such case, Monster Cable issued a C&D to a much smaller, Blue Jeans Cable. The founder actually worked in litigation for 19 years and I found this portion of his response informative:<p><i>I have seen Monster Cable take untenable IP positions in various different scenarios in the past, and am generally familiar with what seems to be Monster Cable&#x27;s modus operandi in these matters.  I therefore think that it is important that, before closing, I make you aware of a few points.<p>After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1985, I spent nineteen years in litigation practice, with a focus upon federal litigation involving large damages and complex issues.  My first seven years were spent primarily on the defense side, where I developed an intense frustration with insurance carriers who would settle meritless claims for nuisance value when the better long-term view would have been to fight against vexatious litigation as a matter of principle.  In plaintiffs&#x27; practice, likewise, I was always a strong advocate of standing upon principle and taking cases all the way to judgment, even when substantial offers of settlement were on the table.  I am &quot;uncompromising&quot; in the most literal sense of the word.  If Monster Cable proceeds with litigation against me I will pursue the same merits-driven approach; I do not compromise with bullies and I would rather spend fifty thousand dollars on defense than give you a dollar of unmerited settlement funds.  As for signing a licensing agreement for intellectual property which I have not infringed: that will not happen, under any circumstances, whether it makes economic sense or not.</i><p>There are several obvious points to be made here, but there&#x27;s a subtle one, too. These hit-and-run settlements depend fundamentally on the compliance of isolated companies. If a larger organization asserts control over a smaller one (like the township-->$3.17 website, here, or on a larger scale Monster-->Blue Jeans), it often <i>does</i> make &quot;economic sense&quot; to settle.<p>It&#x27;s almost a negative version of the Tragedy of the Commons / Public Goods Dilemma. If every small company stood up and said &quot;no, we will not settle&quot; then there would be far less incentive to pursue bogus infringement claims. On the other hand, it always, locally, makes sense not to challenge claims and let some other small company deal with it.<p>This brings me to one broader point, and that&#x27;s the idea of standing for something on principle. I don&#x27;t mean this in the sense of &quot;be a moral person&quot;, but in the sense of larger organizations assuming (often correctly) that the short-term economic sense of individual actors will outweigh any principled objections they hold to the circumstances imposed by the power asymmetry. Cultivation of principles which favor the latter instead of the former course of action might be a good solution to the public goods dilemma outside of a difficult to ensure coordination of action.<p>It&#x27;s worth thinking about this in the context of Google and its recent stance against an entity with an enormous amount of legal power.<p><a href=""http://www.audioholics.com/news/industry-news/blue-jeans-strikes-back"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.audioholics.com/news/industry-news/blue-jeans-str...</a>",1371677144

The ability to share games with family. No longer you need to carry discs to your friends house. You can lend them games to strangers on the Internet without worry about losing it. You can have an organized catalog on the cloud, and never have to get up to pop the disc in. Sell the disc game to X over the internet and cut out the middle man (Gamestop). etc...<p>However the whole, connect 24 hours to verify the ownership of the game is a big turn off. I understand that, theoretically you could sell your game and then keep playing it on a switched off console. So if it were you, how would you go by achieving all the pros and none of the cons without enforcing DRM? Not supporting DRM but genuinely curious.",1371676417

The &quot;rope&quot; portions are the &quot;backbones&quot;.<p>With all traffic funneled through these backbones, the internet is quite centralized.  This make surveilance quite easy.<p>If you &quot;wiretap&quot; the internet nearest the backbones (the thick rope), upstream from where the rope unravels, where the tier 1 ISP&#x27;s connect, you can get a complete copy of everything they get, and thereby everything their customers[0] get.<p>0. The monopolies: Facebook, Google, etc.<p>What could be easier?  Could any network engineer say &quot;no&quot; to a spy agency asking to install a wiretap?<p>There seems a preoccupation with &quot;direct access&quot; to &quot;servers&quot; (e.g. ones receiving your personal info).  But (perhaps) there&#x27;s no need for direct access to any web company&#x27;s servers under PRISM.  (Perhaps) this is not how PRISM works.<p>(Perhaps) PRISM targets upstream routers close to the backbone.  If so, it copies everything coming through those routers.  The web companies don&#x27;t control those routers.  Major ISP&#x27;s do (like AT&T).  The web companies, the &quot;monopolies&quot;, are their customers.<p>A prism deviates the path of a light beam, such as the light travelling through a fiber optic cable that plugs into a router near a backbone.  If you divert the bit stream flowing out of a backbone, you can get a copy of all the bits headed for all the monopoly web companies.  A company called Narus makes devices that can sort out the traffic for you.

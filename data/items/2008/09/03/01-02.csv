Given that they've done to you, the settlement might be never work again type money. At least spend some time checking into it.<p>By blogging you're opening yourself up to lawsuits. Now you'll be spending the same legal fees but with the good result being $0.<p>You're absolutely insane not to sue if half of what you say is true.",1220407188

293442,story,,,2,2,IsaacSchlueter,"Ask YC: Best hosted comment system?",,"I need a hosted comment system that supports the following:<p><pre><code>  1. Import my existing comments from Wordpress.\n  2. Take care of all the user/spam issues.\n  3. Be able to fetch the comment list and count via an API.\n  4. Add some kind of other value (user pages, threading, etc.)\n</code></pre>\nI want to like Disqus.  Really I do.  I like their philosophy, and their site is nice to use.  They seem to do it all so very right.  And yet, I find it hard to trust their service when the Wordpress plugin is so badly broken out of the box.  (Parse errors that make me wonder how anyone's actually using it with a stock PHP install, not to mention very broken markup.)<p>Tangler, IntenseDebate and SezWho have also been recommended.  I've also contemplated some kind of automated system that would let you choose your favorite social media site (HN, Reddit, Digg, etc.), and then auto-post and just get feedback there.<p>Anyone with experience with any of these care to share?  (Or, anyone from Disqus wanna fix the broken?)",1220406927

293439,comment,292813,293030,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"What you said might be true for ""meat markets"" and frat boys involved in contests to see who can bag the most chicks. But that's not all there is to casual sex. Even in meat markets, the ""currency"" is usually fun, not status. You realize girls like sex too, right?<p>Most casual sex is not cold and impersonal. In my experience, it is usually between friends with some kind of emotional connection (just not necessarily a romantic one). Sometimes with people we could be monogamous with, but at a different time/situation (e.g., she was 10 years younger). Sometimes you just want to express your feelings physically (""a hug without clothes"" is a term I've heard), or perhaps it's just a moment/situation you want to enjoy.<p>One example: imagine playing ultimate frisbee and having total synergy with a girl on your team, leading to utter pwnage. After the game, you two are still in sync and hopped up on adrenalin, and fun ensues.<p>That's hardly the status seeking meet market you describe, but it is casual sex. Do you also object to casual sex of this nature?<p>Incidentally, concerning self esteem and casual sex, have you considered that it might be low self esteem leading to casual sex rather than the other way around?",1220406693

I would first and foremost like to see Chrome subverted to serve users (like me) before anyone else (including Google).  I have grown accustomed to an ad-free, relatively secure browsing experience with Firefox.  However, a Greasemonkey-like interface would also have some interesting implications for doing more on the client side than was possible before due to V8's performance.",1220404682

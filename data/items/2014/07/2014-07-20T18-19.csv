8061152,comment,8060649,8061119,2,0,mikeg8,,,"Thanks for the comment – my partners and I could not agree more and that&#x27;s one of our goals with Medko. Patients that would like to go abroad can use our search to find English speaking doctors in LatAm. They can also send them a message to ask about what services the specialists offers for international patients. In the near future, we plan on having specific sections of the site dedicated to U.S. patients, inlcuding all the info they need regarding doctor selection, travel tips, insurance information, and more. Medko doctors can be a fantastic solution for patients that can&#x27;t afford a procedure in the US and that is something that motivates our entire team.",1405882761

8061140,comment,8060294,8060616,3,0,tzs,,,"What would be the mechanism for this?<p>I can think of three possibilities, offhand.<p>1. Buyers prefer non-DRM, and this influences their buying decision.<p>2. Buyers of non-DRM ebooks are more likely to lend them or give away copies, and the recipients them sometimes buy a copy for themselves.<p>3. Buyers of non-DRM ebooks are more likely to lend them or give away copies, and the recipients of them discover a new author that way, and then they buy OTHER books from that author. Since the decision to use DRM or not tends to be made by the publisher, the other books by that author are likely to also not have DRM.<p>I don&#x27;t think #1 is likely. I&#x27;m sure buyers do prefer non-DRM, but at Amazon it is not generally obvious if a given book has DRM or not. There are hints, sometimes. In the product details it sometimes has an entry for how many copies you can read simultaneously on different devices. If that says &quot;unlimited&quot;, it generally means the book has no DRM. If it says a definite number, or says that it is publisher-determined, it means DRM.<p>If you don&#x27;t know whether or not the book has DRM, it is kind of hard for it to make the difference in whether or not you buy.<p>The other reason I&#x27;m skeptical about #1 is that I don&#x27;t think most Amazon customers have had occasion to run into a problem with DRM, and hence probably do not even think about whether or not a book has DRM. Amazon has Kindle reader apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone, and for OS X and for all Windows from XP forward. They also have a browser-based Kindle reader that works in Linux and allows offline reading. This means that most people are not going to run into one of the primary DRM annoyances--not being able to access their content on all their devices.<p>Another DRM annoyance is that it can prevent lending. With physical books, it was common to borrow books from friends, and people want to do that with ebooks. Kindle has support for this. The publisher decides whether lending through the built-in Kindle lending system is supported or not. If they want to disallow it, they have to use DRM (I think). If the book does not have DRM, I think it automatically works with the lending system.<p>I can see that customers might run into this, so that might provide some reason for them to care about DRM. there might be some preference for non-DRM on the part of buyers indirectly because the buyers want books that they can lend. This is the only way I can think of offhand that most users would (indirectly) notice that a book they are buying has DRM--by seeing that lending is disallowed. In this case, it is the lending vs. non-lending that influences the buying decision, not the DRM vs. non-DRM, but since non-DRM is 100% lending enabled, whereas the DRM books are sometimes lending enabled, and sometimes not, there is a positive correlation between lending enabled and non-DRM.<p>They should do an analysis of their data that breaks it down by lending enabled vs. lending not enabled instead of by non-DRM vs. DRM.",1405882458

In the current design, a Vector{Int} always has the same in-memory representation as it would in C or Fortran – you can take a pointer to the first array element and pass it to a library function using the C ABI and it will just work. You also know exactly how your data is represented and can reason about it. You know, for example, that a Vector{Int} definitely does not require any additional heap allocation besides the inline Int values and that arithmetic operations on Ints will just be machine arithmetic ops. I think that the transparency of the C data and performance models has been one of the major reasons for C&#x27;s long-lived success. One of the design goals of Julia is to have similarly transparent data and performance models.",1405882089

In the last month I gave two workshop sessions at ICML  in Beijing, gave a lecture at a drug design conference in NJ and presented at a Big Data conference in NYC).<p>We do basic research but as a small company (and small group) we have to keep our eyes on the commercial application and financial implications of our work. For myself I&#x27;ve found this environment stimulating and if anything has helped my research productivity.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that Gunnar Carlsson - who is mentioned in the article - is both one of the inventors of TDA and someone who participates in the daily development of the company and product.  We have an open seating plan and he currently sits diagonally to my desk and next to one of our most junior employees (not in the research group).  In that sense, there&#x27;s opportunity for people to step up as they desire with access to people who aren&#x27;t just leaders in TDA, but who invented it.<p>As a company we consider someone like yourself in a variety of roles - Data Science, Research or Engineering. In all of those groups people develop novel techniques that could be qualified as &quot;research&quot; and all groups contain people with PhD&#x27;s in technical fields - some coming straight out of grad schools, some after postdocs and some after holding faculty positions. We are broadminded regarding academic backgrounds and there are people with undergraduate degrees making novel contributions as well. One of our presales engineers (who has a PhD) just had a paper published in Nature - which I mention to show how we have research capabilities spread very broadly through the organization.<p>If you want to talk more feel free to reach out to me.",1405881178

Cocktail OS builds for commodity hardware are one thing, but knowing - truly - what is going on in the stack is another thing entirely.  I think thats important, for an Open Source Wifi/Network effort.<p>So any attempt to make an open source router OS that kicks ass, <i>should</i>, in my opinion, predominantly strive to be a self-hosting OS, with full sources on-board, and signed images being turnkey; i.e. everything needed to build the OS from source is part of the package; i.e. no cross-compiling, no binary blobs, the router builds its own firmware.<p>Yes, its extreme, but I truly do think that the disconnect between build-ability and OS &#x27;dependencies management tools&#x27; has a lot to offer in terms of improvement.  If the first thing the machine did, OOBE, was to build itself its own unique system image .. from source .. as a <i>feature</i> for the user .. then we have a secure system.<p>Unsigned system-image keys are going to be very, very much more important in this networking/communication space.  Full source->build->signed-binary control as part of the bootup is where this effort should focus.  Sign the code, build the code, sign the binaries, only run signed binaries on the OS built around the key, and so on.<p>This allows intercommunication - shared Source, of course - but it also allows audit of things in the environment which is being defended.  If we don&#x27;t build-in sufficient encryption to make it truly safe, whats the point of being so Open about it?  Imho, RouterOS should be full-Source onboard.",1405880345

It&#x27;s not designed as a vehicle for immigration any more than any other non-immigrant visa.  Some people are confused with the &quot;dual intent&quot; but all that means is that to get the visa stamp you don&#x27;t need to prove to the Department of State that you are not going to stay in the US illegally.

LessWrong&#x27;s focus on optimizing your life is so great that whenever I failed at something or didn&#x27;t uphold something I said I would do I felt bad about it. 2. One thing that makes me happy (and I think most others would agree they&#x27;re happiest when this occurs as well) is accomplishment. I like the feeling of working on a goal and having that lead to tangible results, whether that means something I&#x27;ve created or something like lifting more weight in the gym.<p>By actually making a change to how I act and seeing the results of that change in the world I developed a lot of confidence (I was formerly very shy and uncomfortable with myself despite having a lot of things going for me).<p>I want to come back to the first point briefly as well. At the time I was reading LW it often felt like I was being productive. I&#x27;d think to myself &quot;oh I just need to read this article on motivation and acrasia (the LW term for procrastination), and I&#x27;ll never fail to do what I planned to do again. This caused me to spend my time <i>preparing</i> to do things that I never ended up doing, and it also set me up to feel angry with myself when I <i>inevitably</i> failed.<p>One thing that helped me a lot was accepting that on top of everything we humans have going for us we&#x27;re really just animals, and we get upset, or jealous, or sad, or angry, just like any other animal. So rather than try to eliminate these negative emotions from my life I came to accept them as normal and try to structure my life so that they occur as infrequently as possible. I&#x27;ve found a few ways of doing this that work for me, and I can post some of what&#x27;s worked if anyone&#x27;s interested. I still have bad days or bad moments, but when I do I accept it as normal and try to see what I can learn from it to lessen the impact next time, rather than trying to over-optimize the life of an unpredictable, fallible human making most of the important decisions in his life based on emotion (hint: that&#x27;s all of us).<p>The allure of LW is that we&#x27;re perfectly rational or that we can at least make ourselves that we through sheer force of will.

Wifi radios are little ARM machines surrounded by a black box, which somewhere depends on a binary blob to do the radio control/communication.  So I think the answer is that the <i>radio</i> is where the open-source is needed; everything else is just a Distro War/-solution.<p>tldr; consumer wifi stacks that allow open network bonding/pairing/ad-hoc connections, are dependent on the vendor-provided firmware blob having control over these features at the radio level.  Thus, we need a fully open radio component to be truly, &#x27;safe&#x27;.<p></opinion>",1405879840

8061035,comment,8059900,8059955,3,0,gwern,,,"> This is surprising to me. I remember reading the blogs around the time and it seemed like a sensible claim. I can&#x27;t remember anyone digging into the data and pointing out flaws. Did they?<p>I&#x27;m not sure that was possible. I haven&#x27;t re-read the original 2006 paper, but it sounds like the claims in the 2006 paper may simply have been false:<p>> I did a number of very silly things whilst on the SSRI and some more in the immediate aftermath, amongst them writing “The camel has two humps”. I’m fairly sure that I believed, at the time, that there were people who couldn’t learn to program and that Dehnadi had proved it. Perhaps I wanted to believe it because it would explain why I’d so often failed to teach them. The paper doesn’t exactly make that claim, but it comes pretty close. It was an absurd claim because I didn’t have the extraordinary evidence needed to support it. I no longer believe it’s true. I also claimed, in an email to PPIG, that Dehnadi had discovered a “100% accurate” aptitude test (that claim is quoted in (Caspersen et al., 2007)). It’s notable evidence of my level of derangement: it was a palpably false claim, as Dehnadi’s data at the time showed.",1405879798

I understood TrueCrypt to be the block device encryption software that filled the same role as LUKS.<p>So, you should refine your claim. Rather than saying &quot;TrueCrypt mounts things insecurely.&quot; say &quot;There are helper scripts distributed with TrueCrypt that mount things insecurely. They should be fixed.&quot;.<p>> I am aware of discussions around &quot;best practices&quot; when it comes to usage of the mount command.<p>The thing about Best Practices is that they don&#x27;t work in all circumstances. If the volume mounting scripts packaged with TrueCrypt get updated, any defaults should be configurable, as there exist folks who need suid binaries in their TC volumes, as well as folks who don&#x27;t like mounting things in /run . :)",1405879652

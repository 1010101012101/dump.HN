357577,comment,357485,357485,0,0,SingAlong,,,"Would like to make a point. G1 doesnt have a head phone socket!<p>After reading all the reviews the G1  sounds to me like its still half polished. And as someone else suggested, get a phone that supports wifi and s60 3rd edition(this supports 1,2 editions too). There are a lot of good s60 apps. My N70 is s60 2nd edition and its more than useful. There's even and IRC client!!!<p>Meanwhile if u wanna type code on the go, then i would recommend a bluetooth keyboard addon too instead of using the phone's keyboard.<p>And dont choose the N70. The keys are a bit small and conjested. I sometimes endup pressing the red cancel button instead of '3'.<p>P.S: this post is from Opera Mini using gprs on my N70. I frequent HN on this. Gmail mobile at m.gmail.com works fine too.",1226156093

Last year they sold 9.37 million vehicles worldwide, slightly more than second-placed Toyota. I don't have numbers for this year handy, but GM is still either number one or number two.<p>When you sell nearly ten million of your products each year, and each one costs maybe $20,000, you definitively do <i>not</i> have a sales problem. You have some other problem instead.",1226155834

357571,story,,,1,1,SingAlong,"Ask HN: Are there ways to get your programmers treated like celeb CEOs?",,"Just read the recent post about Steve Jobs and Fadell on pbs.org and the comments about it.<p>Posts like these always make me wonder if i can treat(or get them treated like) my programmers and others like celeb CEOs(or atleast half of the spotlight). The media spotlight, the praise, etc when something good is done. This might be tough for services companies but seems to me like its very much possible for product companies.<p>Most times its only the leader who gets the credit although a whole dozen programmers(and others) are mentioned in the credits and have strived equally hard. Money doesn't please all too much. Recognition goes an extra mile than money.<p>The credits list which only a few look at and the talkshows and events which a few attend(not every startup organises something big like a Mac event or CES). Any other ways of getting these sweet guys recognised for what they've done?",1226155450

Right now I'm buying gas at $2.30 a gallon and nobody cares about fuel economy so much any more.<p>Really, GM's US-based product lineup is pretty good at the moment (and don't forget, they still make the top-selling car in Europe). I'd be happy with an Astra, a Malibu, a Cadillac CTS, a Camaro, a G8 or a Corvette, and the cars I mentioned would be near the top of my list if I were actually car shopping in any of those market segments at the moment. How many other car companies have competitive entries in so many market segments? Even Toyota doesn't have a decent sports car any more.<p>Product is no longer the problem (though it was ten or even five years ago). The problem is idiotic liabilities.",1226155320

357566,comment,357386,357386,0,0,dctoedt,,,"It's mostly a great post, but the author's first suggestion -- never let the other side draft the contract -- is a good way to kill a big-company deal in its cradle. For reasons good and bad, big companies often insist on using their paper. If you force their contract negotiators to concede on that point, in their minds they already don't like you, and they may be less willing to concede substantive points that you want far more.<p>I used to be the general counsel for a medium-sized publicly-traded software vendor. Before I would even look at a customer's software license agreement form, I had the sales people arrange a five-minute phone call between me and the customer's contracting people. I was usually able to sell the other side on using our form (because our form was extremely customer-friendly). Even when we wound up using the customer's form, though, that first phone call helped establish a positive working relationship, which softened the blow when I sent the customer a redline of their form.<p>(Not to try to divert attention, but I did an <a href=""http://www.drafterschoice.com/2008/11/how-to-kill-a-big-company-deal-in-the-cradle-insist-on-using-your-contract-form/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drafterschoice.com/2008/11/how-to-kill-a-big-comp...</a> of the above comments at <a href=""http://www.drafterschoice.com/2008/11/how-to-kill-a-big-company-deal-in-the-cradle-insist-on-using-your-contract-form/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drafterschoice.com/2008/11/how-to-kill-a-big-comp...</a>)",1226154754

357562,comment,357518,357518,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Yes and no. I agree that data analysis in excel is great and can be very useful. But intuition also sometimes isn't bad, and for the same reason. Excel or similar applications figure out ""patterns"" in data where there doesn't seem to be any off hand. Our brains can too, but on a sub-conscious level, so what we call ""intuition"" is really just the same pattern-extraction going on in a sub-conscious level of processing. So I agree that data analysis is key. But our brains can also do it to a certain extent too - not as an exact, mistake-free thing, to be sure, and therefore excel tools and so forth are still necessary. But, since the same computational principles apply in what we call ""intuition"" we cannot disregard intuition completely either.",1226153410

The advantage of agile is that at the end of every 2 weeks they have something that will build and that sorta works,  whereas often in the non-agile bad shop after the 6 month project you try to integrate the pieces and find they don&#x27;t work together and before you know it you&#x27;ve spent 6 months figuring out how to build and deliver your product but you haven&#x27;t institutionalized it in tools and documentation.",1437594592
9931851,comment,9929187,9929187,0,0,sparkzilla,,,"I think the Bush essay is totally fascinating. I have never seen it before and it&#x27;s amazing to think it was written such a long time ago. However, both it and the Federated Wiki both miss an important part of the how textual information is created and linked on the web, by talking about &quot;articles&quot;. In the essay the user reads through articles and links between articles, while in wiki systems the contributors&#x27; goal is usually to build an article. IMHO the focus on creating articles is the cause of a great many problems on wiki systems, and it also influences the discussion of linking.<p>Taking Wikipedia as an example, readers build up an article piece by piece to create a long text article. However, much of the information inside the article can be better represented as data. Articles are rigid, and the text inside them cannot be manipulated easily. For example, instead of a long article, a biography can be represented as a timeline of events. That timeline of events (as data) can then be manipulated (filtered and sorted) by the end user to give whatever view they want. It&#x27;s not just a matter of following a trail (as the Bush text says), but of collecting the information as you go.<p>Instead of acting as a database of facts or events, Wikipedia acts like a book (a paper encyclopedia). Sure it has interlinked pages, but that&#x27;s where it stops. Because it acts like a book it seems acceptable to have its external links represented as footnotes in a reference section under the main text. Federated wiki runs into the same problem too because it&#x27;s focus is also on articles -- the result of collaboration is a page that cannot act as data.<p>But the web is not a book and both articles and footnotes (and lack of other multimedia features) are not native to the way it functions.  I think there are many better solutions to this problem than going back to footnotes. The medium is the message and solutions need to stop trying to make the web work like a book, but to make it work for the web.<p>I have been working on much of the above on my site. I got round the footnotes issue by placing the source link on the <i>verbs</i> in the text, while internal linking is handled by nouns. <a href=""http://newslines.org/blog/wikipedias-broken-links/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newslines.org/blog/wikipedias-broken-links/</a>",1437594589

The stresses of the company took a heavy toll on Bob and Lore&#x27;s marriage, prompting them to seek a divorce.<p>>Bob fought with Vector&#x27;s board of directors, insisting the company should sell an IBM PC compatible machine, but Lore and the board resisted. [...] &quot;I felt that I had to leave the company and start another one based on PC compatibles,&quot; says Bob. Vector&#x27;s board granted his wish, firing him in 1981. The following year, Bob founded Corona Data Systems, which created one of the first IBM PC clones.<p>>Lore became the first female founder to take her company public on the New York Stock Exchange. But the celebration was short-lived. IBM PC&#x27;s jump into the personal computer market in August of that year had a clarifying effect on the industry.<p>>In 1982, Lore married tech media magnate Patrick McGovern, the founder of research firm IDC and publisher of Computerworld and InfoWorld [...] She sought a new beginning with more time devoted to her marriage. [...] Between the grueling daily commute and a lack of love from the board of directors, Lore had had enough. She stepped down once again, this time for good. It was 1984; she was 40 years old.<p>>The company filed for bankruptcy in 1985, ceased operations in 1986, and a holding company liquidated all its assets [...] in 1987",1437594416

There are several things you can do - in my experience - to manage this.<p>First: scope. Drastically limit every idea to its absolute core, implement that, and <i>then</i> if you&#x27;re  still motivated (it&#x27;s OK to not be) built outward from that. What really helped me personally is Ludum Dare, it&#x27;s a game-making jam, and it lasts only 48 hours. If you can&#x27;t get it done in that time, lay it to rest. This is immensely liberating.<p>Second: expectation. I already ranted about that in this thread, no need to repeat it here.<p><i>> Obviously, I have a lot of technical limitations, like everyone, and this world spins so fast.</i><p>It may seem that way if, say, you&#x27;re trying to keep up with every single new JavaScript framework that comes out. But it&#x27;s not the right way to look at it. We live in a world that&#x27;s keeping legacy software alive indefinitely. When something new comes out, eye it critically, and acknowledge that the <i>menu</i> you can choose from has expanded. There is no need to consume the entire menu or even a large part of it. If you choose to perceive it as a rich, ever-expanding world that gives you more possibilities from day to day, you stop seeing it as a pressure-cooker you have to keep up with in order to stay relevant.<p>To keep with the game-programming examples, one of the most successful game development stories in recent history was built in Java, as a software renderer if I recall (Minecraft).",1437592893

9931625,comment,9916052,9918880,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"> For example, how do you evalute postfix addition? If you have v1.0.0-alpha3 and v1.0.0-alpha10, are all semver implementations supposed to do an alphabetical check until it sees a string? Or should you zero-pad anything with text postfixes?<p>That&#x27;s not semantic versioning. Semantic versions are for communicating feature additions and breaking changes to technical users. Alpha/beta are for marketing and communicating stability to nontechnical users.<p>If you&#x27;re releasing to a large user base, there&#x27;s no reason to do more than 1.0 alpha and 1.0 beta before 1.0. Releasing a ton of times before your big release causes a lot of deploy thrashing that&#x27;s pointless. Unless your user base is truly gigantic, I&#x27;d even be hesitant to release an alpha.<p>If you&#x27;re releasing personalized changes to a few clients, then alpha/beta don&#x27;t make sense: they don&#x27;t care about a general sense of reliability, they care about features they&#x27;ve requested, so just tell them, &quot;This is the release with X feature you are interested in.&quot;<p>Internally, there will always be technical users who might fine use in semantic versioning. If you&#x27;re doing alpha/beta, 1.0 alpha can be 1.0.5 and 1.0 beta can be 1.0.23 and 1.0 can be 1.0.75. Similarly, changes delivered to specific users can just be specific files earmarked for them.<p>> And how do you deal with labeling branches or architectures?<p>Why are you tagging branches with a version number? Version numbers are for stable, tested, cohesive, coherent code points, not for whatever random state exists in version control. If you&#x27;re trying to map version numbers to your git tree, <i>of course</i> that doesn&#x27;t work: git trees are complex. A semantic version should only ever correspond to a stable point in your &quot;source of truth&quot; branch. A version is a commitment that the versioned code point is something you&#x27;re willing to support and put your name on.<p>There are a few ways to deal with different architectures. If you have architectures that are relatively synced and coming from the same codebase, just version them the same: 1.0.1 for Mac and 1.0.1 for Windows are the same, they&#x27;re just different files from the same release. If your architectures are drastically different (Mac is far behind Windows, for example) then version them as separate products: 1.0.1 for Mac can release at the same time as 2.1.5 for Windows.",1437591854

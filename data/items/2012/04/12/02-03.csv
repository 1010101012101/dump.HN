3830806,comment,3829831,3830632,1,0,kijin,,,"I don't see any reason why something like SMTP error messages can't be standardized if several major e-mail software vendors and related groups get together and agree to implement, over a period of 5-10 years, an extension to SMTP. Sure, it might not be as clean as rewriting the protocol from scratch, but it would work for all practical purposes. A lot of features of HTTP that we take for granted, like cookies and anti-clickjacking headers, were added through a similar process. The problem is political and economic, not technical.<p>I also don't see anything wrong with having a free-form, vendor-neutral, decentralized messaging protocol that can be used for a million different purposes. As long as the underlying protocol itself is reliable (e.g. it has proper error handling) and extensible (e.g. you can add custom headers and MIME types that other software won't mess with), innovators are free to implement whatever functionality they want on top of that protocol. Heck, Richard Stallman uses e-mail to browse the web! If you restrict the protocol to what you think should be its only purpose, you're unnecessarily limiting what other people can do with it. That would be like restricting HTTP to hypertext documents only, no AJAX, no API calls, no streaming.<p>IMO, e-mail doesn't need to <i>become</i> a TODO list or notification system. When I say ""fix it"", I mean we should clean up old cruft from the protocol (e.g. make it 8-bit clean) and make it extensible so that it is not too difficult for interested parties to <i>implement</i> a TODO list, notification system, etc. on top of it if they want to. People will obviously disagree about how exactly that should be done, but people disagree about everything anyway.",1334199177

(an indie music social network)\nThere are a few online music serves but what makes my site different then others ? \nThis story should help to explain.\ni'm dealing with an artist who signed a record deal with Sony Red. That means he's at the end of the road and his problems should be over but the new standard deal with unknown artists is the following - \nThe artist will have his cd mass produced for limited release and if the cds sell a certian number in limited release then Sony reserves the right to conside doing a larger run of cds and then promoting them through their network. So it's up ot the artist to advertise their own cds to reach the number because to prove they are a profitable group then they have to reach that number through ""soundscan"".\n(""soundscan"" is a system that records music sales)\nPlease keep in mind that if they don't sale a certain number then they get no support and also upon intially signing the deal they signed any most of their online music rights so even if the shelfed cds don't sell the record company can get paid from the onlie sales and keep most of the profits.<p>The New Music Exchange offers another option.\nAn artist goes to our site and uploads their music and lets fans know that they're on the site. Music fans look them up and if they like what they hear they download. \nNow we can give the artist back a demographic - \nwomen  between the ages of 17 - 25 \nlocation - brooklyn, New York\nhits - 20,000\ndownload - 17,523 \nbecause of this information an artist can now prove that they're profitable and it also gives them the option to go on tour and make money outside of theire original deal.\nThe service is free for music fans and independent artists however it's subscription based for industry accounts however a bulk of our revenue will come from advertising.\nThe site is more then a service - since we now have added NMX radio and NMX social it's more of independent music and information hub where we control content, advertising and promotion. We can even inform members when they're favorite band is in the area and we'll be upgrading to mobile base soon.\nWe are looking for $2m to move our brand further.",1334198743

Barely one year ago I installed Windows 7 which for some reason still came with IE7, which I promptly upgraded to IE8. IE9 came out which I skipped on my laptop because Chrome and FF were more productive. What's hard to stomach is the fact that even while Microsoft is willing to push out version after version, the features that I care about (and really, should we still have to call standards compliance and consistency a <i>feature</i>?) seem to improve in only the smallest increments. What's worse is that all of those older versions <i>stay out there</i>, and each major release tends to leave behind its own black whole which I then have to support, for 2-4 more years.<p>Now all that being said, if IE really has gotten it's act together as you say then I'd be happy to call it a day. Unfortunately no matter how wonderful it is, it probably won't matter until IE8 and IE9 virtually dead (<7.5% of sessions for a site).<p>Edit: Release schedule of Internet Explorer...

345835,comment,345721,345721,0,0,ken,,,"I could see this being useful someday soon...<p>I'm not a fan of the big popup of state abbrevs.  First, because some state abbrevs aren't immediately obvious to me (MD and ME I have to stop and think about).  Second, because mine is always way at the bottom.  (Then I get a mostly-alphabetical list, again sorted by county name.)  I wish it would just show me a map and let me click where I am, even just the simplest USA.jpeg with an imagemap to pick a state.<p>If I type ""wa"" in the box and click ""search"", I get the standard Rails ""something went wrong"" page.<p>If I type ""washington"" in the box, I get a bunch of ""Washington, DC"" parks, followed by a bunch of parks with ""Washington"" in their name.  I admit my forefathers didn't pick the most creative name for my state, but it would be nice if it was a little more forgiving, and show me some Washington parks when I search for ""washington"".<p>I can't find either of the parks I usually visit, nor a way to add a new entry.  I guess that's version 2.  I'd also like to be able to search by what features a park has, which is probably also version 2 (after users have had time to vote!).",1225154395

I saved up miserable work for them all year and, come June, I'd give them one project each. I told they didn't have to come in, nothing. Just log their hours and send them to me every week. I'd make an estimate of how long each project should take, with a guess at what a standard dev might be. Invariably they went insane with boredom and frustration and asked for more projects.<p>I'm not saying my management style was exceptional, but their insight into the nature of work was: if the project bores the crap out of you, ask for two or three more. By working on the more interesting projects, you can save up willpower to tackle the dull-as-rocks first project. You might actually get through the first one faster.",1225152618

I like the name of your plugin(s).<p>The main issue I have with bcrypt-ruby as I said is that there is basically no Windows support for it that I can find. I know that most of us who develop with Ruby/Rails use a Mac or Linux/Unix but there are some, like my business partner, who still use Windows as their development environment. For a Rails plugin or Ruby gem, I think it would be really nice if at least some effort was made to keep it more easily cross-platform compatible for those of us who are not C coders.<p><i>But, I really think for anything that is not being used in the NSA, Sha256 + salt would work just fine.</i><p>As I said, I'm no security expert, but the reading I have done would lead me to agree with you.

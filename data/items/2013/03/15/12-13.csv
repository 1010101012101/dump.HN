5380289,comment,5379766,5379766,18,0,justinschuh,,,"AV software bothers me so much. It's not just that it's generally ineffective. It's that when you bother dissecting it, you usually find it make users less safe (e.g. non ASLR/NX injected binaries, dangerous root certs, vulnerable hooks and format handlers, etc.). That said, Avast has caused me unique pain, and my personal experience correlates with the author's.<p>Chrome's sandbox blocks all access to system resources, so it's a very bad idea to inject hooks into our sandboxed processes, because they usually just break. So, we often have to use the sandbox's loader hooking mechanism to block third-party DLL hooks that are known to cause crashes (ie. ""security"" software and other process-hooking utilities). Of course, Avast shows up regularly as a crasher, so eventually I added their DLLs to the block-list and then tried to start Chrome.<p>So, imagine my surprise when blocking the offending Avast DLLs breaks Chrome by preventing all content--even internal content--from loading. I dig into it a bit more and find that Avast is hanging all our sandboxed processes, because their system-level hooking is so invasive that they won't let any process run if their injected DLL hooks don't attach. At that point I was forced to give up, because there's not much you can reasonably do against such recklessly invasive software already present on the system. It's really not very different from malware.",1363352009

C'mon this is a 101-level topic. You can't expect everyone to suddenly forget how to use an API (with or without native syntax) just because it's for concurrency... or do you?<p>As for Coro, it doesn't matter how many people use it, you can write the exact same things you would write in Go and it will work in the exact same way. It's not cargo-culting, it's writing CSP, which you still have to actually write CSP in Go if that's what you want, and it's perfectly possible not to.<p>The runtime distinction isn't very important either, in fact when I hear ""runtime"" I ask ""why not library?"" Some things are impossible in libraries but CSP is not among them, so I'm still asking ""why not a library?"" The scheduler, probably the most interesting part, can always be implemented as a library. Can you say anything particular to Go's runtime that makes it so special? I can't think of a single thing. The scheduler itself is about as boring as it gets. Not that there's anything wrong with thatit's not a difficult subject after all.<p>As for the popularity contest goes, we might as well be talking about an iteration protocol. There are many different ones but you'd rarely notice it. The most commonly used ones are relatively less-than-great. You can always use a for-loop like you can always write a coroutine or time slicer in the worst case scenario. It works, and very well.<p>The other thing is CSP. Up to now, I wasn't worried about the concurrency model in particular, but now you're saying we can't use actors, agents, etc.it <i>must</i> be CSP. That's BS. CSP is nice when you have to build it yourself, but it's not all there is and it's no easier to reason about than other good options. In fact I would mostly only chose it when I had to build it myself or support for something else wasn't available, which is understandably common.

The equation, for posterity:<p>> Motivation = (Expectancy x Value) / (Impulsiveness x Delay)<p>> Increase the size of a task's reward (including both the pleasantness of doing the task and the value of its after-effects), and your motivation goes up. Increase the perceived odds of getting the reward, and your motivation also goes up.<p>> The denominator covers the effect of time on our motivation to do a task. The longer the delay before we reap a task's reward, the less motivated we are to do it. And the negative effect of this delay on our motivation is amplified by our level of impulsiveness. For highly impulsive people, delays do even greater damage to their motivation.<p>The rest of the article is worth reading. (It's short; 2/3 of the page is footnotes and comments.)

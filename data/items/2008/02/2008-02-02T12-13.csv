It's really easier than moving operators around in your head.<p>The human mind is good at overloading operators.  Especially since the infix < never appears after an open paren, it takes little time to teach yourself to read it as ""ascending"".  It even looks small on the left and big on the right, visualizing an ascending list.  Once you learn it that way, shortcuts like (<= 1 n 10) to see if a number is between one and ten come naturally.",1201956003

If you could mashup a service like compete.com with Technorati then you would no doubt have a powerful tool. I was thinking of hiring someone to get started on a list. Who knows maybe there is a startup in it because it would be useful to marketing companies as well as startups.",1201954971

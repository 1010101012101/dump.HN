That’s the connection (for me) that’s missing from the interview – how did he end up leading a software company? Did he have a hacker epiphany?

301853,story,,,23,63,atavis,"Ask HN: Beaten to the punch by a competitor, advice?",,"I've been working my first startup application for a couple of months out of hours from my 9-5. Not long ago a competitor surfaced and released an application which is very similar to what I have been working on.<p>They are targeting the same market and the application has the same features.<p>From what I have read so far about them they have been very successful (both financially and with creating a community of users) and the application is gaining traction. While this somewhat validates my feelings about the original idea in that it has been a great success for them, I am unsure what to do now.<p>Do I continue working on my own application and release it in a couple of months? I am pretty sure that there is enough market for it but I am no expert on marketing (far from it in-fact).<p>There are a number of older style web applications from competitors, both commercial and open source, but I feel that these are over complicated or bloated and my application is a fresh take on those with a greater emphasis on usability and simplicity (not through lack of features!) which the new competitor also provides. From research I have conducted on those they also appear to be performing very well financially.<p>Does anyone have any advice? Is this sort of thing normal and should I just ignore them and continue anyway?<p>Thanks",1221173880

301842,story,,,4,2,gcv,"Ask HN: Password managers?",,"I've been getting annoyed at dealing with passwords. I have a pretty good mental system for generating good, difficult-to-predict passwords, but even so, I've been thinking about switching to a password manager. I am primarily a Mac user, and it seems that 1Password is a highly-recommended Mac utility, but it makes me a bit nervous.<p>1. I often use machines other than my primary Mac. These machines include Linux and Windows installations. How can I visit registration-required sites if their long hex-string passwords are trapped on a different machine?<p>I see that 1Password provides something called my1Password (https://my.1password.com) for web-based password use, but I have just 1Password's word that everything is perfectly secure back-to-front, and that it doesn't have nasty exploits on its site. In addition, how exactly am I supposed to use this password from the browser? Does it show up in clear-text on my.1password.com, and then I'm supposed to copy and paste it into a password field, thereby exposing the password to the system clipboard on a potentially untrusted machine?<p>2. I don't know if I trust a password manager not to leak the password somehow, somewhere. This particularly applies to banks and other sensitive sites.<p>3. It doesn't look like 1Password supports passwords for things like remote Unix hosts using ssh. I use passphrase-based private key authentication with ssh, but this does not mean that every Unix machine I log into has passwords completely disabled, which still leaves me with a slew of passwords to track.<p>So, HN: how does everyone here deal with passwords? Password managers? Paper notes, as Bruce Schneier recommends (http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/06/write_down_your.html)? Mental systems? A hybrid approach (write hex strings on a sheet of paper and import them into password managers on every trusted computer)? Use ""Passw0rd"" everywhere?",1221172109

Where marginal costs are higher and there are other fundamental limits (e.g. your local music store can only hold so many CDs).<p>The internet potentially has a significantly lower marginal cost.

And, it's slower than my previous XP laptop even though it has over 2x as much DRAM, said DRAM is faster, and each of its processors is faster than the single processor in the XP laptop that it replaced.<p>In the past, replacing an old machine running a previous microsoft os with a new machine running a new microsoft OS left you with a faster system.  Sure, the old OS may have run even faster on the new hardware, but new on new was faster than old on old.<p>Vista broke that.  Even with hardware that is arguably 2x more powerful, vista is slower than XP.  (And yes, I killed the background indexing job that never went into background and never finished.)",1221171046

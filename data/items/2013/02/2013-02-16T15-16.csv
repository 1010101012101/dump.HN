Think of something like Google's self-driving car. I can't imagine that the hard part of that is just sitting down and writing the code.<p>That's kind of what I'm talking about. You can't get a patent claim on ""a self-driving car"" -- and if you do the patent office has failed miserably. Software patents don't cover the overall product, they cover the building blocks you use to make one. And each of the individual building blocks is not the hard part, the hard part is the overall implementation -- assembling them all into a cohesive whole that accomplishes the major goal you set out to achieve.<p>You want someone who starts with the Google self-driving car and sets out to copy it to have a hard time of it legally, so that they decide instead to do their own independent implementation and have their own costs (and maybe advance the field themselves) so that they can't just undercut Google having done no R&D, but at the same time still make it so that they <i>can</i> do an independent implementation without infringing. Those are the two important criteria.<p>Copyright pretty well does the first one. If you can't just copy Google's code out of their car and put it in yours, you have to write some tens of millions or more lines of code yourself. And then you have to test it and stamp out the bugs, which is by far the most expensive part of producing software in practice. (I expect this goes double when the thing you're making is a car.) Patents don't really add very much on top of that -- if someone is already doing an independent implementation, having to work around a patent is a small incremental cost, especially if the issued patent is not so broad that it covers the problem itself rather than a specific solution.<p>Which brings us back to the trouble: In order for the patent system to do anything for software R&D, you can't just have one patent, you need thousands. Which thoroughly violates the second criteria -- now no one can do an independent implementation without accidentally stepping on some fraction of the outlandish number of issued software patents. To clear yourself you have to clear tens or hundreds of thousands of issued patents, but to sue you the plaintiffs need only find a single patent for which you failed to do so. And to shake you down they don't even need to do that, as long as the cost of proving they're full of crap in court is more than the amount they're demanding for a license. These costs vastly exceed any possible incremental benefit over copyright of having software patents at all.",1361030392

You're not likely to convince people of this, I believe.""<p>""Content"" was created long before copyrights.  Technology may have changed and opened the door to new kinds of entertainment, but if you are looking for an example of how entertainment might be created in the absence of copyright, you need look no further than a history book.<p>How will movies be monetized?  Maybe we need movie theaters to deliver a positive experience we cannot easily duplicate in our homes.  Maybe we will see an increase in serials -- you do not get to see the next installment of a popular show until a certain amount of money is paid.  Maybe there is some radically different way to monetize movies that neither you nor I are creative enough to come up with.  As long as we cling to copyright, however, we will not only never see such things, but we will continue to see great systems and technologies killed in the name of copyright enforcement.<p>""Content (of similar quantity and quality)""<p>I think we can strive for something of better quality than what we see today.  The majority of today's mainstream music and movies are not particularly high quality -- formulaic plots, formulaic melodies and arrangements, a heavy focus on special effects to make up for bad storytelling and unoriginal music, and a general lack of creativity.",1361030377

The app server has to do a little processing before sending the pages to users -- it picks a different template depending on whether the user's logged in or not, and then substitutes the user's info into the template (for logout/profile links).  The session info is also stored in redis.  This lets me reboot the server and be ready to serve pages again almost as soon as it's back up.  With all the data, redis uses about 300-400MB RAM on a 64bit Debian VM.<p>I use a VPS for my site, and on a VPS, the only thing you're allocated that you can depend on always being available is RAM.

Surely if there's less work to do then everyone should be working less, not finding new things to do. There's an implicit assumption in our society that everyone must work, even when there is nothing to be done. Productivity is put on a pedestal when it is just a means to an end - undesirable means, at that.<p>I strongly believe that putting people out of work and allowing them to continue living comfortably will bring hidden benefits. There will be more time to think, reconcile and determine the best path to take as opposed to mindlessly doing as much as possible just to earn enough for bread and shelter.<p>Bertrand Russell wrote a good essay on this - In Praise Of Idleness: <a href=""http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html</a><p>As a software developer, someone who will stay employed in the coming years, I'm willing to give up some of my salary so that the newly unemployed can continue to survive and do what they want with their free time.

So you either let open source implementations have the decryption key, in which case the DRM is ineffective; or you refuse to let open source implementations have the decryption key, in which case there's no video on Firefox or Chromium.<p>Perhaps you ask ""Why can't the open source software check itself for modifications any only decrypt the video if no modifications were present?"" - unfortunately, the check could be modified just as easily as the rest of the software.<p>Perhaps you ask ""Surely we could have a little bit of closed source software as a plugin, like flash player?"" - but the whole point of HTML5 video is to get away from shitty closed-source plugins like flash. If you want flash, stick with flash.<p>Perhaps you ask ""What's the big deal with open source anyway? Firefox only has 20% market share"" - but Chrome, Safari and (recently) Opera are all based on the open source Webkit rendering engine. That leaves IE and nothing else. Before open source browsers became popular, Internet Explorer 6 had 90%+ market share and went 5 years without a substantive upgrade due to lack of competition. A return to the bad old days would not be a net win, even for the likes of Netflix, Google and the BBC.<p>The fact of the matter, as I understand it, is DRM barely works when it's closed source and if it was open source it wouldn't work at all. If you think there's some way to implement open source DRM I'd love to hear how.",1361029306

Throw in a few extra features, like a header at the start of the file telling the browser to only play the video file on supported domains (to prevent websites that steal by embedding) and disable saving the move to disk.<p>To the content companies, it will be a lot better than nothing. It gives the same level of protection against casual copying as the more complex scheme, and absolutely every browser can support it.<p>The more complex scheme is an absolute nightmare, essentially bringing us back to the proprietary plugins (like flash) we have worked so hard to get away from.
And it won't even work, there is no way they can stop proficient users from ripping the streams. This scheme will be cracked in a few weeks after it is released.",1361029132

5231662,comment,5231394,5231394,9,0,joel_perl_prog,,,"Great talk! I've never posted before, but I'm inspired to today. Forgive me if my code is formatted terribly this post.<p>I used Perl back around 2000, like everybody else, to make CGIs. Then went away from it for a long time. But I've used Perl over the last year to create a large DMCA takedown system, the bulk of which is spidering and analyzing web pages for infringements. Torrent trackers, one-click file download sites, etc.<p>It's been a beautiful experience. The code runs quickly (for a scripting language), and CPAN is AMAZING. I feel Perl was the best choice for this project, and since I enjoy the language--and trust me, it's NOT line noise: these aren't little scripts, this package-based, documented, modular software development, the likes of which people normally associate with Java (for instance.<p>I have to say I disagree with one point in that talk. I don't think there are ""too many"" ways to do OO in Perl--and this sort of ties into his gripe about ""@_"" and slurping in subroutine arguments, which I think is pure joy. I'm not certain, but I think Larry Wall got this from Lisp. Please correct me if I'm wrong on my history there.<p>Anyway, in one package that I use as an object, I have this code:<p><pre><code>    #/ @param object $this    an Offense::Analyzer
    #/ @param string $event    an EVENT_x constant value
    #/ @param int $targetId    a target id
    #/ @param int $obvious    TRUE for obvious offenses, or FALSE
    #/ @param int $same    TRUE for offenses found on the same target, or FALSE
    #/ @return int    the value for the given event, or undef
    sub getEvent($$$$$) {
        my ($this, $event, $targetId) = (shift, getEventFor(shift), shift);
        my $obvious = getObviousKeyFor(shift);
        my $same = getSameTargetKeyFor(shift);

        return undef unless $this->hasTarget($targetId);
        $this->{'data'}{$targetId}[$obvious][$same][$event];
    }

</code></pre>
And I supplement that code with the following convenience getters:<p><pre><code>    sub getIgnored($$$$) { shift->getEvent(EVENT_IGNORED, @_) }
    sub getNotified($$$$) { shift->getEvent(EVENT_NOTIFIED, @_) }
    sub getQueued($$$$) { shift->getEvent(EVENT_QUEUED, @_) }
    sub getRemoved($$$$) { shift->getEvent(EVENT_REMOVED, @_) }
</code></pre>
I love the convenience of being able to use the incoming arguments array in this manner. In fact, because you explicitly pass the object reference as the first argument to methods in Perl, I even have this:<p><pre><code>    #/ @param object    an Offense::Analyzer
    #/ @param string    an EVENT_x constant value
    #/ @param int    a target id
    #/ @return int    the value for the given event
    sub getEventTotal($$$) {
        int(getEvent(@_, TRUE, TRUE)) +
        int(getEvent(@_, TRUE, FALSE)) +
        int(getEvent(@_, FALSE, TRUE)) +
        int(getEvent(@_, FALSE, FALSE));
    }
</code></pre>
Those are not static method calls (so to speak--package sub calls), but are object method calls. I love that convenience.<p>Does your fluency need to be very high for this to seem like a good idea? Probably. And in this manner, Perl can never compete with Python. But I guess my argument is similar to the argument a lot of Lisp dialect programmers make: I'm an advanced user, I don't need to be babysat, I can take care of myself, and I'm ok with exploiting the expressiveness of the language.",1361027412

Auto-picking your departure city based on your current location is admittedly a nice detail, but it wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious how I change where I&#x27;m starting as the &quot;link&quot; was different than anything else on the page.<p>The &quot;Who&#x27;s Flying&quot; section is massive for having so little real information. And why are that the font is 120px (or 12rem) but the &quot;+/-&quot; controls are faded out and tiny by comparison?<p>The calendar is again completely oversized, low contrast, and difficult to understand. My laptop has a 1440x900 resolution screen and I can barely fit a single full month in the window.  If I happen to want to buy a ticket more than a month or so in advance, I need to repeatedly click &quot;More Dates&quot; which then appends another two months to the already crazy long page? Also, the low contrast purple highlight for all the dates inbetween departure/return isn&#x27;t immediately noticeable.<p>When I click on a ticket price another window slides up over it - took a few moments to figure out what actually happened there. Overall the &quot;ticket selection&quot; again looks pretty, but when I can only see a few in the window at any given time it&#x27;s far less usable than a standard clean list. Also, the &quot;Continue&quot; button looks identical to the other addon options, and it isn&#x27;t immediately obvious how to progress if you don&#x27;t want to upgrade your ticket.<p>The seat selection admittedly is admittedly fun looking though why are half the faces looking upset? Also, versions of the seat selection where they actually place the seat INSIDE the plane in it&#x27;s real physical location are more readable than this abstracted version, though I do like how they clearly broke it up into sections that show the different cabin/seat types. Again though, I can only fit about half the plane on my screen at any given time.<p>Having the form adjacent to the seat selection is a nice touch as you can then easily track who&#x27;s sitting where as you enter their information (especially if you&#x27;re a family with kids), but for some reason they neglected to highlight the seat on the visual map. Also, the form is again overly tall and I can only fit about 2/3 of it at any time.<p>Overall I think it&#x27;s a good start but hardly production ready. My gut instinct is that most people will be impressed by how &quot;pretty&quot; it is, but that the overall conversion rates will decrease significantly. The one really well done idea is the fixed header, though realistically it should progressively fill out with information and not show/hide ticket info at different stages in the process (for instance, it did show my takeoff/landing times and price which was extremely useful, but now hiding that to ask me who&#x27;s sitting in seat 4B, which is already emphasized at the top of the form).",1400892170

Of course, that same kid is probably going home and building Tesla coils and experimenting with high-voltage electronics, or writing code or something after school, but it isn&#x27;t reflected in their grades, and it won&#x27;t help them get into an &quot;elite&quot; school.<p>Also keep in mind that I&#x27;m not saying that a Fayetteville State or UNC Pembroke represents a &quot;fat pipeline&quot;.

7792155,comment,7790075,7791431,1,0,jamielee,,,">I find this assertion to be very surprising. In my experience college, unlike high school, the entire point was to get >students thinking for themselves, rather than accepting that there was a single correct answer. In my freshman year, and >in the freahman year of each of my three daughters, there was always a required class which included a &quot;colloquium&quot; or >&quot;discussion&quot; component. These classes were designed to break students of the habit of treating what was said, or read, as >&#x27;the answer&#x27; and to instead think critically about the facts being tossed about.<p>What is considered &quot;thinking critically.&quot; How do you pass this class? Well, the nature of classes is that someone decides if you pass or not.<p>>Again, my experience differs. Were I or my kids to discover that the University they were attending felt that way I >would immediately withdraw into a more traditional institution of higher learning, which starts with the premise >&quot;everything we know may be false, here are the tools we use to understand truth in the world around us.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t actually a fact. Just your reaction. But it does not disprove anything. It is what you say you would do. And also, you seem to be exerting authority over your kids... I am being a bit pedantic, but you say if your kids discovered [...]then you would withdraw [...]<p>>Again, I would disagree. As an employer I value employees who think over those to simply follow orders. One of the >things I try to ascertain in interviewing folks is whether or they do think. Can they reason to their opinion on a >topic or do they hold it simply because someone else shared it with them? My experience in high school was that many >people held opinions because they were &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;expected&quot; rather than holding them because they believed in them. >It was one of the most depressing parts of that period of my life and I was so relieved when I got to college that >people weren&#x27;t like that really.<p>You seem personally offended, if I am not mistaken. I meant that managers in giant corporations generally (not always) expect obedience from their subordinates. I know because I work at a big company. I have read stories and I see it being satirized all the time. Satire is funny because there is truth in it (even if it is just a hint of it).<p>>One of the interesting statistics is we passed 30% of the US having a college degree in early 2012 [1]. So if 70% of >the people in a group don&#x27;t have college degrees, it is difficult to reason about whether or not &#x27;society&#x27; would be >better off or not. You could ask the 30% of degree holders how they evaluate creating value in society, you could ask >the 70% the same question, and then you could ask which of those two groups has a better idea of what kinds of things >make the world a better place.\n>But a different approach might give better answer. Ask those two groups this question, &quot;How would you go about >figuring out if what you were doing was helping the world be a better place?&quot;\n>College prepares people to answer questions of that form, ones that require the student to not only come up with an >answer, but to construct a process for arriving at the answer that gives them confidence in the result. No pre-made >formula, no quick peek at Wikipedia, but basic reasoning from first principles.\n>I know several people who have that skill and did not go to college, but pretty much everyone who graduated from >college had that skill tested many times and had to pass that test in order to graduate.<p>If 30% of the population had college degrees, then maybe that just means that 30% of the population is just better than the other 70% at passing standardized tests. Does it mean that they made more value in the world? To say that you need college to answer the question &quot;what would make the world a better place&quot; may have been true 30 years ago. But now you have the internet. You can see what is happening around the world. You can venture out and look for problems to solve.<p>Again, with the passing of tests. Someone decides.<p>I am not hating against all colleges. I think MIT is great, because they let students build stuff. I chose to go to a above average college (it&#x27;s not ivy league, but it is more or less well-regarded. I am not trying to be stuck up. I did not even want to go to college. I forced myself. I was lazy and did not want to study SAT. But I definitely am a lot smarter than I was without, but I can&#x27;t say what I would have turned out to be if I had not gone. I liked reading about business so I may have stumbled upon YCombinator earlier if I weren&#x27;t so busy studying textbooks).<p>There is a difference between giving a verbal answer about how to change the world and actually implementing it. The latter is far, far more difficult. College teaches you how to say the right answer, how to think about what could be the right answer. To actually build the solution with your hands comes from internal motivation.",1400891501

It takes some of the fun out of my job for sure, but I don&#x27;t let it stress me out. First, we should always want to be passionate about the projects we work on, and I think this is a result of being passionate in general. Being passionate makes it enjoyable, and it allows you to bring your best work forward (which is rewarding), but in our industry we must always create a balance of cost and quality in the midst of a very complex process. To me, this all boils down to priorities and expectations.<p>When you take your own priorities and combine them with those of someone else, you will never be able to get them to mesh completely. Your priorities may be to make quality code, or to make it elegant or smart -- easily maintainable, extensible, etc. etc. These are things that make it fun, and programmers all know the benefits of these things. Clients, or your bosses, may not understand the importance of these things, or they may, and they may be willing to pay it down later, whatever the case may be, there are conflicting priorities at play and this is the thing you must mitigate to avoid stress.<p>For me, I must either disregard the external priorities entirely and do it the way I believe it &quot;should be done&quot;, or I must disregard my priorities entirely and adopt the external priorities as my own. This may result in technical debt, or a slow progression in the future, or can raise the potential of bugs to be introduced, but these are not my concerns if they are not part of the external priorities.<p>It&#x27;s important that you communicate all of my concerns up front, and if it doesn&#x27;t impact the priorities that are communicated, you must trust that it&#x27;s ok. If you don&#x27;t trust that it will be ok, or think you will be negatively impacted by doing it the way you&#x27;re being asked to do it, you should leave. A management(or client)/ employee relationship is built on trust, and if you don&#x27;t have that trust you will be less happy than you could be.",1400890928

I didn&#x27;t go to a powerhouse school for undegrad, and I&#x27;ve subsequently worked with a lot of people from &quot;powerhouse&quot; schools.  In my experience, there&#x27;s not much difference between a top MIT/Stanford/Berkeley undergrad and a top student where I went to school.  The difference is in the distribution: the best schools can pick amongst great applicants, and therefore have a better average student.<p>The valley is very credentialist, in my experience.  Most bigger companies are dominated by graduates from top programs, partly because they have dumb recruiting policies (i.e. paying big money for career fairs at top programs, and ignoring everyone else), partly because once you get a network of grads from a school, it tends to perpetuate itself.<p>But to the extent that this turns into a bias <i>against</i> students from other schools, it&#x27;s an institutional weakness.

If it were a headline, the headline would be: &quot;15 Easy Words You Should Read Right Now That Tell You All You Need To Know&quot;.<p>I disagree from observing the actual use. There&#x27;s times when it is used for a comment that is nothing but a summary, or when it used (with or without other comment) for a hostile summary. Sure, those are bad, but they are bad <i>independently</i> of the use of the phrase &quot;tl;dr&quot; to signal a summary.<p>But much of the time its used on HN its used to either (a) distill the commenters understanding to contextualize the comments being made more clearly, or (b) to introduce a summary of the commenter&#x27;s own detailed comment.<p>I don&#x27;t think those are problematic. Yeah, the origin is dismissive. But the use on HN often isn&#x27;t; the abbreviation &quot;tl;dr&quot; isn&#x27;t the problem, and looking at it as if it was is looking past the real problem it is sometimes associated with.<p>Rather than saying &quot;don&#x27;t use tl;dr&quot;, it would be better to say &quot;don&#x27;t post <i>just</i> to summarize&quot;.",1400889737

7792037,comment,7789014,7789438,4,0,methodover,,,"> More broadly, the best and most creative work comes from a root of joy and excitement. If you lose your ability to feel joy and excitement about programming-related things, you&#x27;ll be unable to do the best work.<p>This is probably true. If you&#x27;re happy with what you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;re probably (but not certainly) going to be better at it than someone who isn&#x27;t happy with it, all else being equal.<p>However, being happy with one&#x27;s job is not a reasonable goal for most people. Or, to phrase it a little more flagrantly:<p>The idea that we need to be happy with our jobs is bullshit.<p>Among the programmers I know, many of them claim to love programming enough that they&#x27;re happy to do it full time (AND work on side projects!) -- and to them, earning a paycheck is almost an afterthought; it&#x27;s a nice side effect. The amount doesn&#x27;t even really matter to them all that much because programming is just so much fun. (This is not a straw man -- I&#x27;ve personally listened to employees at Facebook, Google, and various Silicon Valley startups express this very notion.)<p>These claims are not easily proven true or false, but I suspect that most of them are false. I think that if a programmer represents himself as anything other than absolutely in love with programming, then they lose a competitive edge.<p>The truth is, I think, that programming is just a job. It has it&#x27;s ups and downs, and it&#x27;s certainly less terrible than many other jobs. Like most jobs, you&#x27;ll be given tasks that you can&#x27;t get out of and you just have to learn to deal with.<p>Not being in love with your job is does not constitute a very serious situation. It&#x27;s simply a necessary evil for most people.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re one of the lucky ones who likes his job that you do it from a &quot;root of joy and excitement&quot; on a daily basis.

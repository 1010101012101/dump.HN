- Their app will be a lot tougher to crack. It won't be an automatic process like it most likely is now. Last I checked, all it took to crack an app was breaking the encryption and adding a ""SignerIdentity"" key to the Info.plist.
- They take away the ""try before buy"" excuse some pirates use as justification.
- They get their product into more people's hands => get more people talking about it.",1256353166

Working with the MVC framework is more like working with ruby on rails but using C# instead of ruby, you don't get the heavy intermingling of layers that you inevitably will get with web forms + code behind.  In addition there is no more view state... in fact it is basically completely stateless.  Test driven development is also possible.  Right now its a free download.

Eventually you could get everything for Windows and software at random for another OS.  The equilibrium here seems to be a for a single dominant OS maker.<p>Reminds me of the Dvorak v. Qwerty keyboard layouts.  The market has space for a single dominant keyboard type.  Individuals can choose between Dvorak (and variants) or Qwerty, but since so many people use Qwerty, everything is designed based on that.

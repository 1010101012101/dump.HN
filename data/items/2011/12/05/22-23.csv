During a roundtable discussion, various younger doctors came up with lengthy suggestions and lots of different chemotherapy regimens, tests, etc. When it was this doctor's turn to speak, he said: ""Well, if I were to put myself in that man's shoes, I would go to the store, buy a case of fine liquor and drink myself happy for the next few weeks until I'm gone.""<p>He had seen enough ""therapies"" to know enough when to forgo them.",1323125980

3316931,comment,3315188,3315438,1,0,kaybe,,,"Planet mass is usually a parameter that we have, even though it does not influence the position of the habitable zone (so Mars is out).<p>The simplest calculation does not involve an atmosphere and just looks at radiative balance from black body radiation and is probably the kind of calculation they're talking about in the article. For getting the real temperature many parameters play a role and most are not available, so they just use a first guess for the habitable zone.<p>An atmosphere will change this radiation balance, with absorptive gases and aerosols blocking radiation (both in- and outgoing) and by distributing the heat more evenly. Atmospheres can be detected if the planet's orbit is good, and it is possible to get an idea about the composition (mainly water, methane and CO2 so far), as well as see changes which are probably due to weather. The method used is to look at the center star's light that travelled through the atmosphere of the planet when it traverses; it's also possible to look at the atmosphere's reflection when the planet is almost behind the star. I can go find some spectra if you're interested.<p>Another important parameter in the equations is albedo (""ability to reflect radiation""). Warmth left from the planet's creation and radioactive decay as well as gravitational effects from other bodies (eg the effect Jupiter has on it's moons) are the other possible energy sources. Geological activity of bigger planets could lead to aurora and allow detection that way, but the instrumentation is not up for that yet..<p>In our solar system, some moons are considered candidates for life, being covered with a thick layer of ice and possibly containing water underneath and they're not in what is considered the habitable zone of the system. The concept is more of a guideline at this point, really, and also only looks at water (arguably the best candidate for life, but not the only one).<p></rant>\nIn case you want more information about anything in particular I can find some papers or overviews.",1323125822

AT&T, TellMe and BeVocal were big players in this market during the last tech boom.  Naturally, there was a lot of marketing behind these systems.  Many claims were made that these intelligent agents would understand you and make common tasks easier.<p>It was all hype then, and it's all hype now.  The dialog management found in Siri is likely based on research that's 10-15 years old - a slot-value style of filling in a form.  VoiceXML is an example. It's the bastard spawn of speech recognition and XML, born in the late 1990s. It's woefully underpowered and simplistic, but it works reasonably well if you have good UI designers.  Unfortunately, DARPA cut the cord on speech recognition grants in the early 2000s because they considered it a ""solved problem.""  The number of speech dialog research projects fell and the subject has stagnated a bit.<p>Apple has great design for GUIs and hardware, but VUIs are a different beast altogether.  Nuance (which provides the ASR software for Siri) has experience with creating VUIs for large corporations, but I can guarantee you they don't have the end-user ethic that Apple does.

Siri really isn't a super AI. It's not a Star Trek computer, able to infer intent and reason enough to fill in the gaps in what you didn't say, and respond in perfectly-inflected English, yet that's what Apple's marketers are playing it up as. This is immediately obvious in the anthromorphization of Siri as ""she"" - a person, a gendered, thinking entity.<p>There was an awful lot of brouhaha over the past week or so about Siri being ""anti-feminist"" because it failed to produce results for certain womens' health terms, and because it fails to understand terms in colloquial/contextual senses, rather than in literal senses. The reason this was even an issue is because people have believed that they're being sold a thinking assistant, so failures to locate politicized terms are viewed as intentional censorship rather technological failure. One person writing about it was offended that Siri couldn't determine context for a given query despite her ""obviously female voice"". Where did that expectation come from?<p>We, as technologists, understand that Siri is a voice recognition system married to a search engine and integrated with the phone's calendar system. The vast majority of the population doesn't. They expect it's just ""Apple magic"" that's going to sell them what they've been watching on Star Trek and CSI for the last 20 years. The product doesn't live up to that - and it can't. I don't think it's wrong for people to be disappointed by it. The fault - and triumph - lies with Apple's marketing department. They've done a bang-up job selling the feature.<p>By comparison, Android's voice recognition performs pretty similarly to Siri in terms of practical usage, but it's neither hyped by the marketers, nor made into the crux of the marketing campaign for various Android phones. The result is that people don't buy Android for voice recognition features, and they aren't disappointed when the voice recognition features don't work flawlessly.<p>Apple's marketing department could sell ice to an eskimo. Doesn't mean the eskimo shouldn't be disappointed after the fact.",1323124210

Most people travel long distances with the idea that they'll accept the burden for something better, be it a house, salary, or school. They presume the trade-off is worth the agony. But studies show that commuters are on average much less satisfied with their lives than noncommuters. A commuter who travels one hour, one way, would have to make 40% more than his current salary to be as fully satisfied with his life as a noncommuter, say economists Bruno S. Frey and Alois Stutzer of the University of Zurich's Institute for Empirical Research in Economics. People usually overestimate the value of the things they'll obtain by commuting -- more money, more material goods, more prestige -- and underestimate the benefit of what they are losing: social connections, hobbies, and health.

Similarly dogs are the only non-primate species to look at the right side of a persons face to gauge their emotion and state, but unlike primates and humans, they don't do this with other species or dogs.<p>Evidence points to dogs having a limited theory of mind, in that they can actively be deceitful, meaning they can understand the perceptions of other animals.<p>Not to mention, dogs are already known to have the ability to rationalise, empathise and have abstract learning abilities. They're capable of the whole range of human emotions, including clinical depression, melancholy, anger, rage, etc. Beyond that, they're capable of empathetic sadness and anger. They also display the same ability as many of the great apes to mourn their dead, but notably dead humans.<p>Orangutans are largely being made extinct for the same reason that humans have made wolves and tried to make numerous other species such as foxes, rabbits, etc. extinct. In that they're pose a risk to our economic livelihoods. Orangutans are dying because of deforestation and poaching.<p>Wolves evolved into a evolutionary niche as dogs, and as dogs have become as wide spread a species as humans and have evolved far beyond their ancestors. To the point that they actually rank above primates in certain tests of cognition and social behaviour - notably the two behaviours that are attributed as key elements of human evolution to sentience.",1323122965

For example, a steel foundry which acquires a competitor and can now buy iron at a lower price because it buys in higher volume. The increase in profitability of both foundries from the decreased cost of iron is a ""synergy"".<p>Value-add<p>Comes from Michael Porter (I think) and refers to the idea that each of the activities a company performs on their inputs before the final output should add value to the final product. If the company is unable to add value through one of those activities it's something they should pass to another party.

The problem is the kind of skill required to do math usually leads you somewhere else besides public school, and if you are going to teach its going to be college level.<p>Most of the time anyone who really learns math ends up teaching it to themselves. It can be tough to find self motivation if you are struggling at all so the only kids who like math are usually the ones that instantly grasp concepts, they can do the rote busy work in a few minutes and spend the rest of class day dreaming about math ideas or reading ahead in the textbook to sections they find interesting.

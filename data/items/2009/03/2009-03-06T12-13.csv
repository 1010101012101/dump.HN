The implication seems to be that things just need to be reported in XBRL and that all the information people doing analysis need is there (just not in a consumable format).<p>My side project is an SEC search site (<a href=""http://edgarest.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edgarest.com</a>) so I've spent a huge amount of time looking through what is available. The disclosure is just not there -- I'm pretty confident that you couldn't have seen the Bear collapse from the filings they made. You can look at a huge proportion of the filings here: <a href=""http://edgarest.com/company/name/777001/BEAR_STEARNS_COMPANIES_INC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edgarest.com/company/name/777001/BEAR_STEARNS_COMPANI...</a> for Bear itself and <a href=""http://edgarest.com/search?q=bear+stearns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edgarest.com/search?q=bear+stearns</a> for associated entities. Too much of the trading they do and the assets they hold are still opaque to SEC reporting. Along with getting people to file using XBRL we'd have to force companies to increase disclosure (and you'd get a huge amount of pushback on that).",1236344285

It is a rant on Git, it is very shallow, it compares Git with an operating system family and filesystems.<p>I stand by my comment, in fact it probably was very tame.

505419,comment,505104,505292,0,0,sanjayparekh,,,"So I guess there is a two part answer.  I should have said that in the title of this post but the wording I used was confusing and removed by the powers that be - as it should be.  I didn't change it to say ""inspired by"" because it's a moot point.<p>We also didn't say it on the site because we didn't want people to think we were approved or licensed in some way to be YC in Atlanta.  We aren't and we didn't ask for approval.  In fact PG made a comment on a previous post that he hadn't heard of us and couldn't keep up with the clones.<p>That said, we are taking the YC forms (thanks for open sourcing those!) and using those as a base for us.  There are likely some minor changes for Georgia law but for this initial round we are innovating close to zero.  We want to try it first and see what happens.  If we want to innovate after that, we will.<p>That said, I wouldn't say just ""inspired by"" I'd say ""heavily inspired by"".",1236343923

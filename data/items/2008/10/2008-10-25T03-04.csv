343312,comment,342358,342866,0,0,time_management,,,"The ""one company for one's whole life"" era lasted... significantly less than an average human lifetime. It certainly wasn't present during the Great Depression. It began in the 1950s and ended in the '80s,  but even then, people were more mobile than was often said. The difference is that the <i>ideal</i> was to have a long, monotonically increasing career at one company-- it didn't always happen that way-- and that a person who shifted was implicitly assumed not to be successful. A major change the '80s brought about was a recognition that most people's involuntary job changes were through no fault of their own.<p>Well-to-do 18th-century people prized generalism and aspired to be polymaths. The professions emerged in the 19th century, but these were structured as lifelong careers, not jobs, run by individuals who would develop reputations. Corporate paternalism didn't emerge until the World War I era, when workers moved into company towns, and more services (e.g. medical care) were provided, directly or indirectly, by the employer than the community.",1224906688

When LiveJournal first had its scaling difficulties in 2002, anyone with any experience in programming kinda rolled their eyes at what Brad was doing and thought ""This college kid doesn't have a clue.""  I mean, writing the whole app in Perl?  Relying on MySQL boxes that went down frequently and usually took a whole cluster with them?  Walking clusters to build a page?  Putting your object traversal logic in the app instead of convenient SQL queries?<p>Everybody knows that the way to build a scalable webapp is to write in Java or C++, buy an Oracle database and leverage the thousands of man-years they've put into making it perform well on top-end hardware clusters, use stored procedures and constraints to offload processing to that database, and getting a big SAN for storage.  Scalable webapps were a solved problem in 2002: after all, EBay and Amazon had done it, as had dozens of Fortune 500 companies.<p>Fast-forward to 2008.  Now, memcached is standard scaling procedure.  Federation among dozens of cheap MySQL boxes is standard procedure, with boxes arranged as master/master pairs to deal with the pesky failure problems.  Everybody uses commodity hardware, and big server vendors like Sun and IBM are in serious trouble.<p>I think the real issue is that young workers have much stronger economic incentives to embrace disruptive technologies.  They have more work years ahead of them and less investment in existing technologies, so it makes a lot of sense for them to choose technologies that suck now but will (or could) be big in a couple years, because if their bet pays off, they're suddenly on a level playing field with people 20 years their senior.<p>It's not always blind exuberance, arrogance, and inexperience that makes young people choose new technologies that are ""worse"" than their old alternatives.  They could be taking a very shrewd (and unverbalized, if they're that smart) ""fuck off, elders"" risk.",1224906620

That is, if you were born in 1981 and felt that Nirvana and Reality Bites and Microserfs were items that you feel define you and your peers, then you are Gen X.  If you were born in 1981 and are/were more interested in Hanson/Britney and Varsity Blues and not reading books (I keed!), then you are a Millenial (Gen Y).  I was born in 1977, an unrepentant Gen Xer.<p>I think most of the comments here support this general self-assessment.  (God knows that anyone in Gen X was all-too aware of the fact.)<p>P.S.  Obama, born in 1961, is on the X/Baby Boomer cusp.  But given his single-parent upbringing and general awesomeness, I have always considered him our first Gen X big-time leader.  The biggest unspoken issue of the 2008 campaign is our movement away from a Baby Boomer or GI Generation president in a very very long time (Eisenhower was our last Pres not from GI/Boomer Generations).  McCain, born in 1936, would be the FIRST member of the Silent Generation to become President, ever (Bush II: Boomer; Clinton: Boomer, Bush I: GI; Reagan: GI; Carter: GI; Ford: GI; Nixon: GI; LBJ: GI; JFK: GI; etc.).

343292,comment,342358,343237,0,0,bokonist,,,"Unions in some sectors are more powerful than ever.  Nurse unions in particular are very strong, much more so than they were fifty years ago.  The education sector, construction, and government employees at all levels, have very strong unions.  If government policies destroyed the unions, why are the public sector unions so powerful?<p>Also, to a large extent occupational licensing has replaced unionization.  See this paper for instance: <a href=""http://ftp.iza.org/dp3675.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftp.iza.org/dp3675.pdf</a>  
Excerpts:
""During the early 1950s, less than 5 percent of the U.S. work force was covered by licensing laws at the state level (Council of State Governments, 1952).  That grew to almost 18 percent by the 1980s with an even larger number if federal, city and county occupational licensing is included. By 2000, the percent of the workforce in occupations licensed by states was at least 20 percent, according to data gathered from the Department of Labor and the 2000 Census. ...Our multivariate  estimates suggest that licensing has about the same quantitative impact on wages as do unions - that is about 15 percent...""<p>It's hard to unionize a hair salon, because anyone can open a competing hair salon and undercut the prices.  So instead, the hair dressers lobby the legislature to pass occupational licensing laws which create barriers to entry, thus raising the pay.<p><i>Those jobs were replaced by retail and service industry ones which, in the 70s, were also largely unionized.</i><p>Were they?  Places like Sears or Sandy's Drive-In were not unionized in the 1970's.  Which service and retail jobs were unionized in the 70's that are not today?<p>One theory is that its hard to establish unions in industries that are mobile and have low costs to entry.  If Walmart employees unionized, it wouldn't be long before a Target moved in and undercut their prices by using non-union workers.  Pre-1950, factories were only profitable near rail lines and ports.  The rise of the highway system and power lines made factories much more mobile.  This allowed factories to move to locations where unions were not so powerful.  This is the Doug Rae theory from the book I recommended above.  I don't really buy it though.<p>More likely, I think the high unionization rates of the 1950's were a result of New Deal and World War II corporatism.  As the giant ""organization man"" corporations created by the New Deal gradually declined, so did unionization.<p>I'm curious.  You run a company.  If you were interviewing a potential employee, and he announced to you that he might strategically refuse to come to work at some point in order to extract a higher wage, would this make you think twice about hiring him?  Do you think the government should make it illegal for you to hold the candidate's comment against him in the hiring process?",1224904919

611999,comment,610950,611977,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"Sure, but doesn't this increase the average age of YC founders, especially since you still advise young people to go to college?<p>Put another way, rather than telling 18-year-olds to start companies, you now tell them to go to college for the experience - where, as you say, they're at a disadvantage as startup founders. I assume you wouldn't tell them to do both at the same time.",1242458642

611997,comment,610896,611981,0,0,nostrademons,,,"A dollar earned is actually more like $0.60-0.70 saved after taxes.</pedantic><p>Anyway, I know a bunch of people that think the same way.  I knew one girl who basically couldn't afford to <i>eat</i> - she'd go hungry for several days at the end of each pay period because there was no money to buy food.  (Not too surprisingly, she ended up with an eating disorder.)  But she had more ""stuff"" - big screen TV, DVD-player, IPod, home entertainment system - than I've ever had.  Her logic was that a few hundred bucks might by food for a couple weeks, then she'd just be hungry again.  Or it could buy a big-screen TV, and she'd be hungry longer, but at least she'd be <i>entertained</i> in the meantime.<p>When she put it like that, it almost seemed rational.  Being able to save and invest for the future is a luxury I have because I've never really had to want for the basic necessities.",1242458222
611996,comment,610896,611976,0,0,jibiki,,,"> And by the way, loan provisions are not mandated by government but negotiated up front. If you make a non-recourse loan, you won't get access to the borrower's personal assets even if his business goes belly-up.<p>I did not know that.  Admittedly, I don't have any examples that work quite as well.  Maybe medical malpractice... or is that just a breach of contract?",1242458104

I know I am not stellar at good looking UI, but I can whip out ""passable"" designs which you wouldn't puke at.<p>More tips for an all dev team:<p>- I found the typography defaults that blueprint css has, to be sane and easy to tweak.<p>- Use good icon sets (psptuts, smashing magazine) - dont reinvent the wheel there.<p>- Read. Read. Read. - ALA, smashing mag, psdtuts.<p>- Practise. Practise. Practise. whatever you have read.<p>- Enjoy doing it. Once you add passion to the mix, life gets easy.",1242457677

611985,comment,610896,611019,0,0,HSO,,,"Actually, this is precisely what they are not teaching in economics: That people are weak, stupid, and make mistakes. Instead it teaches that they are informed, rational decision-makers who carefully weigh their options and choose the one that maximizes ""expected utility"". Schmoo! This is why we are in this mess!",1242457389
611984,comment,609861,611175,0,0,euccastro,,,"The original article doesn't claim income equality is the <i>only</i> factor in wellbeing.<p><i>A less equal society that attracts more productive people could easily do better than more equal societies which lose said people.</i><p>That assumes, amongst other things, that productive people will flock to where they are best paid regardless of other factors, and that more unequal societies will pay them best, and that the impact of such migrations is an overriding factor in the overall productivity of a nation. For you that's probably common sense, in my experience it's utter BS. That's why studies like the OP are necessary.",1242457251

If they'd been left behind, stranded far away from the ""land of opportunity,"" would they have been better off?  I'd guess no on both.  There's a reason immigrants flocked to America, event with a pledge of service.<p>So quit with this slavery nonsense.  Slavery is not slavery when opted for, in full knowledge.  Likewise, honest mortgages are no more slavery than education loans.",1242457242

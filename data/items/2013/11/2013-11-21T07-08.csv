I don&#x27;t think anyone involved in this thing, from da Vinci, to the modern builders, to the performer, to the audience, thinks for one iota that the purpose or destiny of this machine is to replace or diminish string musicians to any extent.<p>I see this as an exercise in technology and history, and a celebration of what was certainly an innovative idea in da Vinci&#x27;s time. Really, it makes more sense to think of the viola organista as a synthesizer or a sampler, invented centuries before the modern electric and electronic incarnations.<p>On the more practical side, before synthesizers and samplers, this would probably have been a ground-breaking tool for composers. To be able to play and hear rough arrangements of string pieces (again, not to replace string musicians, but rather to easily hear a much closer approximation than any contemporary keyboard instrument could produce) would no doubt have been amazing for composers in that period.",1385020038

This way it still cannot be so easily reversed or rainbow-tabled, and collisions still shouldn&#x27;t be an active problem.  However, it wont be possible to positively match a given IP to a hash, since multiple IPs will likely hash to a given output.  Granted, if you have a candidate IP and it matches the output hash, there is a very high probability that it was the source IP, but it wouldn&#x27;t be 100%.",1385019975

Things don&#x27;t cost money anymore, instead they cost our private lives. This is a bargain we&#x27;ve been making for a long time, and people are subconsciously aware of it. I think this plays a huge role into why people don&#x27;t care about the NSA in general...every fucking other organization is spying on them too, what&#x27;s one more??<p>I&#x27;m convinced the way to combat it is to provide services people use that are convenient and respect privacy. Not via easily-broken promises (Privacy Policy!!) but by enforcing privacy in the client. If cloud services only store encrypted data, you get the convenience <i>and</i> the privacy without compromise.<p>Once more companies make this shift, I think you&#x27;ll see people realizing they don&#x27;t mind spending a few bucks (hell they spend it on new apps all the time) to not have a million anal probes jammed into their private lives 24/7.",1385019765

It&#x27;s always about bugs.<p>But code that has <i>never been executed</i> can have orders of magnitude more <i>categories</i> of bug than code that works at least once. And I&#x27;m good enough that 99% of the time I don&#x27;t miss the corner cases -- it&#x27;s the more blatant problems that tend to bite me, and those are eliminated by making sure all the code gets executed at least once. Once my code is wired up right, it tends to work. But I won&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s wired up right until it&#x27;s been executed once.<p>>Lack of complete test environments for your mandatory 3rd party APIs suck!<p>Try writing code for systems without the ability to debug. Or where something is going wrong and there&#x27;s <i>no way</i> to figure out why based on logging or debugging. Or without complete (or correct!) documentation. Or for projects where, once you ship, <i>there is no option to patch your app</i>, so it needs to be as close as possible to bug free. Thankfully modern platforms (mostly!) avoid the last pitfall, but I&#x27;ve been there, along with the other situations. And I win these battles.<p>>I suspect we have a fundamental disagreement of opinion as to what constitutes &quot;overkill&quot;.<p>No, I&#x27;m just not communicating effectively. And it&#x27;s no longer worth it for me to try any harder.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m <i>not</i> talking about complete test coverage. The apps I usually write (games) are almost entirely pointless to write tests for. Ever. Sure you can for some specific libraries you&#x27;re using, but for the actual game itself? Hardly ever worth it.<p>I&#x27;ve shipped games with zero chance for patching, some pretty popular -- and I didn&#x27;t hear of any bugs worth mentioning after release. And there were no tests involved in the development process (other than the kind where QA tests the game and tells me what doesn&#x27;t work). I know that concept is a bit alien on HN, but it&#x27;s rare to find a game (or even a game engine) with a nontrivial test suite.<p>Most game bugs wouldn&#x27;t be prevented with unit tests anyway -- probably only one in a hundred at best. They almost always result from emergent complexity, not from a single function returning a bad value.",1385018827

But it was widely understood unlike Begali. And it was in no-way restricted to cow belt[1], even after ignoring how big that belt really is and how much population it holds. People in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat fully understand Hindustani[2]. Hell, Ghandi was from Gujarat and he used Khari boli.<p>> You gave an explanation why Bengali was prevalent, OP&#x27;s point was that Bengali was prominent. Why it was so was besides the point.<p>OP said there were more Bengali speakers than Hindustani. I am saying that it is not true.0 I will have to check what effect inclusion of Bangaldesh might have had, but remember we are talking about national language. It ought to be understandable to large parts of nation - large parts of ethnically different groups.<p>Btw, if you want to step onto political land-mine, try comparing grammar and vocabulary of Bengali and Bhojpuri/Bihari. The idea of Hindi vs Bengali will take a new meaning :) Language is indeed political.<p>> It still does not change the fact that it was imposed.<p>Hindi was <i>supposed to be</i> encouraged over English, but it has never been imposed. You just have to get down in Chennai railway station to know that. The anti-Hindi propaganda is purely political in nature. As a matter of fact, no body in even &quot;cow-belt&quot; (Haryana + Delhi + UP + Bihar) + Madhya Pradesh + Gujarat [1] speaks standardized Hindi (though they all understand Khari boli). If you speak it in Delhi - the heart of Hindustani as it was - you will literally be laughed at.<p>> BTW I am by mo means Tamil.<p>I don&#x27;t care man! :) I am not a native speaker of khari boli either.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_belt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_belt</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.ht...</a>",1385018662

Otherwise, use two held-out sets, one for development, and another for testing. Cross-fold actually really sucks!<p>The small problem is that cross-validation has you repeating everything N times, when your experiment iteration cycle is going to be a big bottleneck. Second, it can introduce a lot of subtle bugs.<p>Let&#x27;s say you need to read over your data to build some sort of dictionary of possible labels for the instances, given one of the attributes. This can save you a lot of time. But if you&#x27;re cross-validating, you can forget to do these pre-processes cross-validated too, and so perform a subtle type of cheating. Coding that stuff correctly often has you writing code into the run-time about the cross-fold validation. Nasty.<p>With held-out data, you can ensure your run-time never has access to the labels. It writes out the predictions, and a separate evaluation script is run. This way, you know your system is &quot;clean&quot;.<p>Finally, when you&#x27;re done developing, you can do a last run on a test set.<p>Bonus example of cross-fold problems: Sometimes your method assumes independence between examples, even of this isn&#x27;t strictly true. For instance, if you&#x27;re doing part-of-speech tagging, you might assume that sentences in your documents are independent of each other (i.e. you don&#x27;t have any cross-sentence features). But they&#x27;re not _actually_ independent! If you cross-fold, and get to evaluate on sentences from the same documents you&#x27;ve trained on, you might do much better than in a realistic evaluation, where you have to evaluate on fresh documents.",1385017217

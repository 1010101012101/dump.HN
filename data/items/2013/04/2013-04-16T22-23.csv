5561474,comment,5560922,5560922,1,0,coldtea,,,"><i>Rarely do I speak with such certainty. I have spoken against only dualism, nonreductionism/creationism with such certainty in the past. However, as I will show, this argument clearly is a form of creationism and therefore must be dispensed with in the same forceful and rigorous manner as we treat other forms of creationism. Unfortunately, these arguments, purported to be good philosophy by many gullible thinkers, are not respectable arguments for a serious philosopher. Rather, they are superstitious drivel and metaphysical nonsense redressed in scientific-sounding jargon and mathematical-looking notation, making a mockery of both science and philosophy, and they must be regarded as a source of embarrassment by any intellectual worth his material.</i><p>This is mostly ""rigorous hand-waving"". Nothing argumentative or serious about the above ""argument"" (it's not even an argument -- it's mostly vague accusations of ""badness"").<p>While we might dispense with ""creationism"" in the biblical sense of the anti-evolution zealots, nothing in science or philosophy tells us we should dispense with all notions of ""creationism"" in general too, for example the Simulation Argument.<p>This, the way he states it, is an a priori, knee-jerk reaction, which is not scientific or philosophical at all.<p>><i>Let us review the premises before we get to deeper mistakes and methodological errors common with this sort of ontological argument. There is, first of all, absolutely no reason why the first premise [civilizations dont reach post-human stage] should not be true.</i><p>There might be no 100% certain reason why it should not be true, but sure there are signs that we're getting there ourselves, hence it has a high probability of being proven wrong in practice soon-ish. After all we have some kinds of AI, cloning, computer simulations etc already.<p>><i>Bostroms assumption in the paper that it is possible to create a virtual reality prison somewhat like in the movie The Matrix, of the entire Earth is acceptable. Such a computer would likely require enormous resources, but it is possible given access to stellar energy sources in the future, given energy-efficient computers, and energy drawn from blackholes, etc.</i><p>This takes for granted OUR resources and energy needs, which would only be a criterion if we were the originating world. What about the resources of a ""host"" system? Those kind of energy needs could be peanuts there.<p>><i>The suggestions in his analysis are all far off. They disregard how much information the human brain processes and the resolution of our perceptual and scientific apparatus, and what sort of complexity would be ultimately distinguishable to human observers, leaving out obvious artifacts that would show the world to be a simulation.</i><p>Human observers maybe, but why would the ""inhabitants"" of the simulation notice any issues? They would be conditioned/programmed not to, after all, in the same way we take for granted the Kantian a priori forms (as limitations to our perception of transcendental reality), the speed of light limit, the limits of our vision compared to the full frequency spectrum etc.<p>><i>The obvious thing is that quantum events work everywhere, we have our atomic microscopes and various quantum devices, and for those to work you need a complete and consistent physical simulation</i><p>This just tells us about the level of detail of the simulation (of which we cannot say anything in absolute terms: e.g the Plank's constant could be laughable crude unit in the ""host"" universe).<p>><i>That is, Bostrom thinks such simulations will be relatively cheap. Well, this is the second part that is troublesome. Such simulations are never going to be too easy to program or run. Simulating quantum systems requires a lot of computational speed and memory, that cannot be easily shrunk down as Bostrom thinks (his first major mistake). A universal quantum computer of that size would cost a lot of energy and space-time no matter how you design it.</i><p>""And 640K should be enough for everybody"". We simply don't know that. And even if it was true, it would only be critical if we are to assume we are a host world, and not a simulation.<p>But there's another issue. He says:<p>""One problem here is that we do not even know if constructing an enormous universal quantum computer is possible. If not, that is a big obstacle, because simulating n qubits would take asymptotically more space and time (say it might require n squared units given current quantum computing theory).""<p>You don't even need an ""enormous universal quantum computer"", given the principle of Turing completeness. You could do it with a current PC + storage + time. It would just take longer time.<p>Not to mention that the simulation doesn't have to simulate everything in the universe. Like Chess AI does, or more like 3D ray tracers do, it could ""smartly"" prune stuff that is not of importance in the current step of the simulation or is obscure by other stuff.<p>E.g if a tree falls in a forest and nobody is there to listen to it, the simulation could sidestep the sound producing routines.<p>The things behind us could go ""un-rendered"" when we don't look at them. Remote galaxies could be rendered with fewer resources, as a crude general vector of influences towards us, as opposed to at the quantum level of detail.<p>>* What is the numerical sense here? The laws of physics can likely be encoded in under 1000 bits. Possibly less than that but we are exaggerating for the sake of argument. In reality, we know much shorter universal codes, digital physicists claim very compact universal machines to encode the entirety of physical law, which would amount to under 100 bits. However, an intelligent design scenario, that is a world designed by an intelligent agent smarter than a human requires an initial state of at least the complexity of human brain and civilization required to get it to post-human level, which is many orders of magnitude larger than 1000 bits.*<p>Err, those ""digital physicists"" though are very close to the simulation argument, that is they argue that the universe is an automaton for example. In that case, it being an automaton inside another automaton does not require any additional complexity.<p>><i>If we were in a simulation, this would be discovered sooner or later. However, for that one requires evidence, for extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and Bostroms SA fails miserably in providing such an extraordinary evidence.</i><p>What about the extraordinary evidence for the extraordinary claim that ""if we were in a simulation, this would be discovered sooner or later""? But what mechanism would it magically ""discovered sooner or later""?<p>Do entities in Box2D simulations ever discover they are C++ classes? Why assume that we are that better than a hypothetical simulation environment we could be in than Box2D objects are in relation to Box2D and it's programmer?<p>><i>SA is wrong also because it is just a theory of turtles all the way down. It offers absolutely no valid theory of cosmology.</i><p>It doesn't have to. It can either keep our theory of cosmology, and apply it to a parent system (or consider us the starting simulation), or it can say that at some point the simulation chain breaks and there's a cosmology in action there of which we cannot really say about (but it's inhabitants might).<p>><i>[SA is wrong also because] It doesnt answer what the age of the cosmos is, what its extent is, how much energy there is, what the energy distribution of the cosmos is, how much entropy there is and so forth.</i><p>That's circular reasoning.<p>If SA is right, then it doesn't matter if our science ""answers what the age of the cosmos is, what its extent is, how much energy there is, what the energy distribution of the cosmos is, how much entropy there is and so forth"", because that answer would be false anyway.<p>I could go on, but the whole article is juvenile, filled with ad-hominem, circular reasoning and hand waving.",1366152817

5561468,comment,5559281,5561098,16,0,bencpeters,,,"I agree with you that it's necessary to look at evidence. But the evidence actually pretty overwhelmingly supports the general Keynesian framework for a financial crisis like this. Look at the data on austerity measures/spending vs. growth worldwide in this crisis (<a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/18/austerity-and-growth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/18/austerity-and-gr...</a>), or any data on similar circumstances (the US ""double-dip"" in 1937 during the Great Depression, before WWII deficit spending brought us out of it, Japan in the 90s, etc.). The real question is, where is there ANY evidence/what is the model for the opposing view? Does it in any way match up with what really happened over the past 4 years? (because the AD-deficit/Keynesian view does)<p>Responding to the complaint about Obama's economic advisors being wrong is easy - they were wildly optimistic. However, plenty of economists including Paul Krugman were saying this at the time (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/opinion/09krugman.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/opinion/09krugman.html?par...</a> - note the date Jan 9, 2009, before Obama was even sworn in). The math is pretty basic - according to the aggregate demand view of the crisis you have a combined housing/financial shock that totaled at least 6% of GDB. The stimulus was MAYBE 1.5% of GDB, and that's being generous with assuming that high end tax cuts are just as effective as outright spending money (I would argue that they are not, since in a saver's economy, much of that money is just saved straight away). The Obama stimulus package was 4+ times too small to address the magnitude of the problem by this model; no one who has this view of the world is surprised that unemployment is still high (the only surprise was that Obama's advisors had such a rosy-eyed, not data-driven view of the world. They deserve a LOT of criticism for that).<p>Your ""fall back on models that we do understand and have a lot of data for, like how businesses and households manage debt"" is completely at odds with reality for two reasons. One is that it doesn't really imply what you say it does; most rational, not capitally constrained businesses/households (and the US is emphatically not capital constrained - bond yields are as low as they've ever been) invest when they have absurdly low interest rates - you're basically getting free money from the market, it's not a rational response to cut back in a situation like that. The second, and arguably more important, argument, however, is that the government occupies a fairly special position in the economy, since it alone among economic actors will never run out of money. Therefore, the government has the unique ability to act in a counter cyclical manner - it can counteract the collective saving of  businesses/households to stimulate demand during recessions, and pull back when the private sector is roaring. (You give me 5% unemployment and 4-5%/yr GDP growth and I will be all for govt deficit reduction)",1366152663

This is a format specifically for label printers, and the specification makes it easy (""easy"") to command a printer to print, say, barcodes in almost any style without having to create some sort of graphic. 4x6"" is pretty common.<p>UPS and Fedex's APIs allow you to specify a label size as input, and they return a base64-encoded EPL file as output. You can then take that file and send it to your printer.<p>This works fairly well with CUPS, which is how I've automated our shipping (just make sure you use `lpr -o raw` so that it treats that EPL file as raw input. Otherwise, the printer sometimes prints the label as an ASCII file.)<p>I'm unsure about the USPS api - but I would argue that most high-volume shippers do not use the USPS, due to lower-quality detailed tracking info.<p>When you print out the shipping label on paper and tape it to the box, you are using the courier's api's ""GIF"" or ""PDF"" feature, where it returns the label in one of those formats. This is great, but in my experience, it is pretty hard getting them to print properly on your label printer.<p>Finally - and not a lot of people know this - UPS and Fedex will give you a label printer, and labels, for free! If you have high volume (unsure of the threshold) then you should call to negotiate your rate and have them bring you hardware (and set up your computer) for shipping.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eltron_Programming_Language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eltron_Programming_Language</a>",1366150998

5561281,comment,5557797,5560180,6,0,knz42,,,"Minimum energy usage is very dependent on not activating more circuits than strictly required for a given computation.<p>However a conventional processor pipeline will usually fetch instructions and begin processing them, only to realize later on that they were not necessary. This happens upon mispredicted branches, cache misses, exceptions, etc. These correspond to circuits that get activated, spend energy, only to throw away their results because the instruction's effects must be discarded.<p>In contrast, in a dataflow processor, each instruction indicates explicitly which other instruction(s) will produce its input. Or conversely, which other instruction(s) get activated as the result of one instruction completing execution. This way, instructions only enter the pipeline when their operands are ready, and speculation never occurs. So there is no more energy spent than strictly necessary to do the work (instructions).<p>Now, the <i>reason</i> why we use the former forms of speculation is that it is the only way to make the pipeline fast if there is no information in the instruction stream (program) about the dataflow dependencies between instructions. Because it does not know better, the scheduler has to either: 1) try all instructions in program order, start do work as early as possible, and sometimes need to discard the work already started because an earlier instruction has decided a branch / fault / etc. or 2) rediscover the dataflow links by analyzing the instructions as they enter the processor, but then again the silicon logic to implement these tricks is also costing energy.<p>The funny thing is, all compilers know about dataflow dependencies between instructions, but they throw the information away because the existing instruction sets cannot encode it.<p>So really the situation should be simple: make new processors that support dataflow annotations, extend the compilers to encode this information (which they already have anyways), and off we go.<p>However as others have highlighted making new instruction sets is like a ""moonshot"" because you have to involve a <i>lot</i> of people: compiler implementers, but also OS devs and everyone who will need to port their code to the new ISA.<p>Besides, dataflow processors have a gorilla in the kitchen too. In a ""pure"" dataflow scheduler, all the instruction order is destroyed and as a result, cache locality is broken. So the flip side of the coin becomes 1) bad memory performance 2) extra energy expenditure on the memory system to deal with cache misses.<p>Now there are ways to get the best of both worlds.<p>One is to destroy the ordering of instructions only partially, by only applying dataflow scheduling on a window (eg the next 20 instructions). This is more or less what modern out-of-order processors do, although they still waste energy re-discovering dataflow links at run-time.<p>The other technique is where many of us are going right now: use multiple hardware threads interleaved; keep the instruction order within threads to exploit whichever locality is encoded by the programmer, and apply dataflow scheduling techniques across instructions from separate threads, ie exploit maximum instruction concurrency between independent threads. Sun/Oracle started it with Niagara, now ARM is going there too. This approach really works <i>very well</i> in terms of operations / watt, however it requires software to use threads in the first place and not much software does that (yet).<p>Also there is still a lot of ongoing research.",1366150411

I think the narrative is pretty unfair to 1Password, and that they're bending over backwards to seem reasonable and attentive.<p>The problem as I understand it is that 1Pw runs PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 <i>twice</i>. 1Pw stores encrypted passwords using AES-CBC. It derives a 128 bit AES key from the first run of PBKDF2, and the 128 bit CBC IV from the balance of the first and the first bits of the second. Based on that design, it appears that 1Pw believed that the secrecy of the IV would contribute to the difficulty of cracking the encrypted blob, but of course it doesn't, because the trailing bytes of the blob are known plaintext and an attacker can use the key without knowing the IV to check if their password guess is right.<p>This is not a great design. But it's bad in a way that wastes cycles for users. The fact that 1Pw does extra PBKDF2 work that doesn't bind on attackers don't make 1Pw meaningfully weaker than any other app that uses PBKDF2, because it was already weird that they were tapping PBKDF2 twice to begin with. A more idiomatic use of PBKDF2 in this situation would be to tap PBKDF2 <i>once</i>, and then expand it (say with SHA2) to 256 bits. That design, which is totally reasonable and would not be the subject of a news story, would be equivalently secure to the ""flawed"" approach 1Pw took.<p>There is another problem with the construction 1Pw uses, which is that they chose PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1. PBKDF2 with SHA hashes are among the easiest KDFs to crack on GPUs, because SHAx was designed to be fast in hardware. 1Pw would have been much better off with scrypt, or even bcrypt (which is still a pain to implement in GPUs). But PBKDF2 is an industry best practice; to ding someone for using it while the rest of the world still uses ""salted hashes"" seems unreasonable.<p>What's happening here, besides the echo-chamber effect, is that the implementation of the brute force cracker for this particular encrypt blob is clever. In a rush to applaud cleverness, Twitter seems to have lept to the conclusion that ""clever attack"" means ""vulnerable target"". That's usually a correct assumption, but it isn't in this case.<p>Corrections more than welcome.<p> <i>They deserve some kind of medal for that, by the way, because I have no dog in this fight at all and I can't seem to shut up about the unfairness of it all.</i><p> <i>It turns out there's a clever way to optimize this on a GPU by precomputing the ipad/opad in HMAC, too, which sped the cracker up.</i>",1366149949

Your dev environment (IDE, text editor, etc) can still be in the original environment you are familiar with.<p>For example, just yesterday, a colleague wanted access to Fork the Cookbook's source (he was supposed to be helping out on frontend javascript). But because some bits of the code is written to be Linux specific, he needed a Linux box while working on a non-Linux box.<p>So I spent 30 mins creating a Vagrantfile, specifying the environment which Fork the Cookbook runs in. He takes it, runs the env, provisions with the existing provisioning script, and tadah, you get an environment where you get to run the code  in.<p>Due to the synced directories, you can code in whatever env you are hosting on: it's like dropbox between your computer and the virtual box. Network pass throughs allow your host (i.e your physical machine) to use networks defined virtually in your virtual computer.<p>Great for sharing execution env  and getting other people started. Not really necessary if you're working alone IMO",1366149807

When wrong, their debt may just cut into the other assets on their balance sheet.  Perhaps creditors will allow them to refinance so that their debt servicing is below their investment.  Perhaps they'll go bankrupt.  Perhaps they'll close their doors.<p>The US government 1. Has a really crappy track record of finding a return for its investments.  2. Will cause much more world disruption if it has guessed wrong on the whole ""returns on investment vs debt servicing"" equation.<p>Finally, businesses do not borrow money without limits.  Their borrowing of money is based upon the amount of credit that outside parties give them.  Given the US Government's downgrade in its rated ability to service its debt, shouldn't we be concerned that we're overextending ourselves?",1366149672

I didn't draw clear enough distinctions, and in fact, I probably lost sight of the distinctions myself in responding.

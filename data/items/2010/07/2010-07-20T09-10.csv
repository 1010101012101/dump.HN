1531612,comment,1528523,1529779,0,0,Slackwise,,,"> So, would this inactive/status flag provide a significant benefit over editing the name/description/readme?<p>You can always cram more data into another field, but now you've lost easy access to valuable metadata--this would be a hack, rather than a solution. Proposing for users to use a hack rather than a clean, semantically different, UI element is not good on your part as a designer.<p>A ""Status"" field benefits users as repository pages can have a prominent notification of the current status. You can also use it as a flag for searches to avoid having to wade through various abandoned projects before finding one that is being maintained.<p>And for the GitHub developers, it will provide a valuable statistic. Now they can track the progress and usage of repositories without potentially using assumptions like ""Hmm, this repo has not be committed to for X days--could be abandoned?"" or having to parse through the description/readme for keywords like ""abandoned""  or ""no longer maintained"", etc.<p>So yes, I would say that this simple metadata field would significantly benefit the users and developers.",1279619929

1531606,comment,1530778,1530827,0,0,Natsu,,,"It's weird, because they've always just clicked for me.  I mean, you have text and you compare it to a pattern.  The regex is just a crazy shorthand for the pattern you're looking for.  What pattern should you match?  Well, first write down examples of what you want to match and see what they have in common.<p>I think it's easier to get if you match a pattern to some text by hand, taking a simple pattern like ^a+b<i>c$ and trying to see if it matches:<p>Here are a few test cases:<p>""aaaaaaaaabbbc"" ?<p>1) ^a+ means it starts with 1 or more 'a's, so those eat all my 'a's and I'm matching bbbcc against 'b</i>c' now
2) b* means 0 or more 'b's; those eat up everything but the c at the end.
3) c$ matches exactly one c at the end, so yeah, we have a match.  If there had been one more c (or anything else), the match would fail because it wouldn't hit the $ (which is end of string).<p>aaac ?<p>1) ^a+ eats all the 'a's again.
2) b* ... what b<i>?  It's ""zero or more"" so yes, we can skip it.
3) c$  Yes, there's one c at the end.  We have a match.<p>bc ?<p>1) We need </i>one* or more 'a's at the start.  That's the difference between + and <i>.  Match fails immediately.<p>acbbc ?<p>1) ^a+ matches the a.
2) b</i> means it's optional, so we don't fail... yet.  But we don't match anything, either.
3) c$  That c matches, but we're not at the end of the string yet.  There's still ""bbc"" left to match and we're out of pattern.  Fail.<p>You can do something similar with the tools other people have linked in comments.  This was just to give an example pattern and a few test cases to get you started.<p>It's weird, though.  Even though this clicks for me, I don't feel like I get monads at all.  Yeah, I've read the 3 monad laws (great... so something being a monad means that I can monad it, un-monad it and do something vaguely similar to composition on monads) and I can do some very simple Lisp which uses built-in stuff they say is built from monads (like printing).  But I don't know how they work internally at all, or how they're fundamentally different from all the other Lisp statements (""causes side affects"" isn't terribly specific... why is printing to the screen a side effect?  Is setq a monad?).<p>In other words, there's probably some topic for every programmer that they really have to struggle with.  As easily as regexes come to me, I struggle to understand other stuff.<p>I've been at it for quite a while, incidentally.  But I'm not going to give up any time soon.  So keep working on it.",1279619618

You hear about some of these cases because, rightly, it occasionally hits the media but in general it is not happening a lot (comparatively anyway).<p>I put on the relatively tag for a reason.  I heard of about 7 cases in one year, each one of them completely insane.  That's a lot relative to where I'm living in Europe where I've heard of zero such cases.  It's also a lot relative to how many <i>should</i> have happened, also zero.<p>>but I don't think it is a result of either being a pedophile or sex offender.<p>No, most people behave this way because they've been horribly and dangerously brain washed into behaving this way.  So how do you ""fix"" them?<p>Imagine some less extreme behaviors that people could do and how it would be greeted.  Imagine some intimate situation like a young man proposing to a young lady in a restaurant.  Suddenly some jerk walks up and loudly farts in his face.  How would this be reacted to?  I can think of a lot of potential reactions, all of which would be extreme enough to let the drive by farter know that this kind of behavior is not acceptable.<p>Now lets step it up a notch.  Someone urinates on the floor in the middle of a semi-crowded area.  Now we're talking jail time, right?  Maybe the person grew up in a culture where this was acceptable or even expected.  Doesn't matter, they did something <i>more</i> extreme than the last example and will be greeted with a more extreme result.<p>Now back to our clerk.  This person looked at some normal family photos and reacted by ruining someone's life.  I think this person finding themselves the subject of such an investigation would be appropriate and effective at teaching people that this kind of bizarre behavior is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.<p>>Not to my mind. They are reacting irrationally to images that disturb him/her; it does not make them a sex offender.<p>Neither did the person taking the photos.  Remember, my statement was <i>if I had to pick between the two of them</i>.  Would you seriously pick the author in that situation?  Then I have some bad news for you...<p>>if you saw, through a living room window, someone strangling another person whilst having sex with them would you call the police?<p>Bad example.  Enough people are into such behavior that I absolutely would not call the police.  Further, if I did I would fully expect to find myself on the business end of a peeping Tom case.<p>But if we changed your example to me just seeing someone being strangled then I would call the police.  Because I saw something extreme happening.  I would not call the police if I saw two people hugging.  See the difference?",1279619227

The problem here is that they are evaluated by the number of arrests (easy to assess), instead of the actual efficiency of their work (very difficult to assess accurately).<p>This evaluation method is of course as disastrous as lines of codes are for programmers.  As a result, 1% of the French population has been arrested at least once last year.

I don't think ""readability"" should only mean ""readable by someone who is unfamiliar with the program's conventions and is encountering it for the very first time"". It does mean that, but it should also encompass ""readable by someone who is working with the code repeatedly, as if it were clay"". Devices (like long names) that help you read the code <i>de novo</i> can get in the way after a while. <i>Map</i> itself doesn't mean what it says; it's a convention, one I bet was introduced for brevity. I think it's reasonable for languages and programs to adhere to conventions and ask the reader for patience while first working with them, especially if the notation has been crafted to maximize the intelligibility of the code over the long haul.<p>One doesn't just sit and speed-read math in a single pass. Nor poetry. Good programs have that kind of density and deserve the same consideration; they are not newspaper columns. The trouble with the shallow notion of readability that says ""I should be able to random-access any line of code and understand it right away"" is that it results in <i>less</i> intelligible whole programs, which is a net loss of readability and of other things as well.<p>I wish more good programmers understood this. The bad ones we can just write off, but too many good ones have been schooled to focus overly on the line-of-code. If you have a million lines of code, it doesn't much matter how readable an individual line is; nobody's going to be able to read the whole thing.

Unbelievable, the way these people push their way in to peoples lives, guilty by default and if you are very very lucky you might get to keep your kids at their say-so.",1279617156

To suggest they are ""consumers of child pornography"" is just a bit rude...<p>What is absurd is a situations where natural actions (taking photos of your children) become, randomly, life ruining [1].  You say my suggestion is rude but this is in fact exactly what happened to the author of the story.  If one of these two people (the author or the clerk) had to have their life ruined because of the <i>chance</i> that they might be dangerous I would pick the clerk as he/she is <i>actually</i> exhibiting bizarre behavior.<p>Further, having an extreme reaction to natural things indicates some kind of problem.  I can't know if the clerk was sexually aroused by the photos, felt guilty and reacted extremely to fight against those feelings that he/she knew were wrong.  I can only see the extreme action they took.  I can't know what triggered it, but it's definitely a problem and more worthy of looking into than the random innocent by-stander who triggered this persons episode.<p>[1] If this were isolated it might not be such a huge issue, but it's happening quite a lot (relatively).  Remember the recent case where photos of a <i>17 year old girl</i> in a bikini were investigated as child pornography?  What about the guy who was naked in his house making breakfast and was accused of being an exhibitionist?  Couple this with the insane ""child abuser register"" the US has and things look pretty alarming.",1279617054

I studied undergraduate business and I can tell right away the difference between an MBA-run business and non-MBA-run type business. People with MBA's have a broad base of case studies, so they know how to handle some eccentric but important situations pretty well, but they tend to like formality, business plans, marketing plans instead of ""screw it, let's mess around and see what happens"" - not sure what the ratio of MBA to non-MBA in Google management is, but Google seems very much like a non-MBA culture. In fact, their CEO Schmidt has degrees in engineering and computer science. They probably have MBA-type people running Adwords, though, you'd almost have to.<p>Edit: chillingeffects.org and dataliberation.org are backed by Google, which is very much more a hacker ethos than an MBA ethos type move.",1279616989

They are trying to fight the death rate up there, and as they can't be everywhere at once, they were just doing all they could to proactively prevent. I think it'd be totally unreasonable to get upset over that.

Should I have learned them before that?<p>Many programmers seem to think that they possess just the right amount of knowledge. Someone who knows Unix utilities but not algorithm design will argue that Unix utilities are vital, but algorithm design is a random obscure topic; someone with the opposite skillset will defend it just as eloquently. I think programmers have no obligation to know anything. If you can do the job, I don't care how much you use Google.<p>I'm spoiled enough to think that boring things shouldn't be deliberately memorized. It's enough for me to know the mathematical concept of a regular language, which lets me recognize situations where regexes would help. For concrete syntax we always have cheatsheets. This attitude has its advantages: for example, I never needed to be explained why parsing XML with regexes is a bad idea.",1279616693

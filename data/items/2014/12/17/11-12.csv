8761968,comment,8757269,8757913,0,0,inventitech,,,"The first step is just to observe how much time is spent on testing. We have basically no clue about this. And our first study with students has also shown that they had no clue about it.<p>In a second step, we can think about which implication testing time might have on quality. As you said correctly, more time does not necessarily correlate with better quality or higher productiveness. Maybe there is a certain range of testing efforts that can be associated with good quality tests? E.g. if you spend less than x on testing, your tests are likely to be bad. If you spend more than y on testing, it might be worth investigating whether you have unusually high testing targets. Or your tests might be extremely hard to maintain.<p>I think the answer is Janus-faced and there is no single, simple answer (see also &quot;Testivus on Test Coverage&quot;, <a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=204677"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=204677</a>).",1418817508

8761939,comment,8758915,8761808,0,0,stingraycharles,,,"You do realize there is already heavy, impression-based competition going on in the ad market (google &quot;real time bidding&quot;, for example)? That is exactly the kind of disruption you are asking for. AdSense is usually only used to fill remnant inventory; any big publisher uses a hybrid of real time bidding, direct sales and ad networks nowadays.<p>Running your own ad server is a big, big liability. While running a news website is mostly a read-operation, adservers are extremely write-heavy (every adview results in at least 2 write operations). Do that 10 time for every page view, and have 100 pageviews a second during peak times, and you suddenly find yourself becoming and engineering company instead of a publishing company.<p>Anyway, the scenario you are describing to &quot;disrupt&quot; to ad market is exactly the scenario we had in the 90s. Everyone was using phpAds, which could be embedded directly from within php, and advertisers ran almost exclusively CPM based campaigns. What happened? Publishers found out that their adserver was eating >95% of their server resources because frankly, adserving is HARD, and advertisers found that their ROI was crap because people didnt click ads.<p>The real disruption is already happening, in the background, far away from where the public looks -- real time bidding has completely disrupted the adserving market in the last two years, and more and more ad networks find themselves becoming irrelevant.<p>Disclaimer: i was co-founder and cto of an adserving platform.",1418816480
8761938,comment,8758678,8761529,0,0,tripzilch,,,"I&#x27; an Android (Cyanogenmod) user and agree with your point, this could--and should--be done a lot better.<p>I am not familiar with iOS and iPhones at all. You state iOS apps only rarely need to be granted permissions, how do they make that work? I can see only three ways that could happen:<p>Either the app can do most things without asking permissions (bad for the user--there&#x27;d be malware). Or the app simply can&#x27;t ask for permission to do a lot of things (bad for the developer, and ultimately the user--because less functionality). Or it&#x27;s a combination of the first combined with the iOS App Store&#x27;s walled-garden quality check approach (bad for everybody, and the biggest reason I got an Android instead of iOS device).<p>I could be wrong but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the third option?<p>I&#x27;m going to try to be objective here, crazy how I can just <i>feel</i> that seed of fanboiism in my head, let me just leave it at me being idealistically opposed to the walled garden approach for reasons that have been rehashed on HN for ages now :)<p><i>That said,</i> there&#x27;s also a few practical things the iOS walled-garden App Store could improve upon. First one being the $99 developer fee. I teach kids computerstuff and one time a particularly clever 11-year old needed some help setting up Eclipse, I didn&#x27;t have a smartphone myself back then, I wasn&#x27;t sure what he was trying to do, so I just helped him navigate the English menus, install the proper Java things and let him at it. Sure enough, an hour later he proudly showed me his Android phone. &quot;Hello World&quot;, it said.<p>Another thing, this iOS App Store review process, it&#x27;s done by humans yes? Does it scale? From what I&#x27;ve heard, even though I mostly heard it in the form of complaints, you get rejected by <i>actual humans</i>, yes? That&#x27;s obviously never going to happen to Google&#x27;s Play Store. But then again, the Google Play Store isn&#x27;t quite as deeply engrained into Android as the iOS App Store, you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to use it, you can even completely step out of Google&#x27;s ecosystem and still use Android (though it&#x27;s hard, a bit like using Linux 15 years ago). Does the iOS App Store also use scanners and automated tests for new applications? I bet they do, do we know what kinds? Like it could test for certain kinds of API calls so the human reviewers know what sort of thing to look for.<p>One funny thing is, I used to have to explain people what &quot;repositories&quot; are in Linux, what they do, what they&#x27;re used for and why they&#x27;re so much cooler than (Windows) having to download .exe installers from all sorts of websites to get your software. Nowadays I can just tell people &quot;it&#x27;s pretty much like an app store&quot;, and they know all they need to know. That Ubuntu Software Centre even <i>looks</i> like an app store, with all the stars and ratings (blegh).<p>However, the repositories in Linux, are <i>not</i> quite like either the Google Play Store <i>or</i> iOS App Store. They obviously do not have the walled-garden approach, it&#x27;s entirely open. Linux software from the repositories doesn&#x27;t need to ask for permission for anything (except sudo). Still, there is no malware in the repositories, at all. I admit I am a little bit vague on how this works too, perhaps I&#x27;m missing something obvious, but how do they do that?",1418816473

I recall in my operating systems course we had to implement some simple concurrency patterns using semaphores as an exercise -- for instance synchronize a group of processes so that idle processes gather into groups of N, and when a group is ready, N-1 threads of the group does TaskX(), and 1 thread does TaskY(), and when they&#x27;re done, they go back to the pool. Then we implemented the same using usual mutexes and condition variables. I encourage everyone to do that, to see how one of the approaches is much more complicated than the other. Linus says that almost all practical uses of semaphores is when they are just used as mutexes, and rightly so -- implementing concurrency patterns based only on semaphores is a total pain.",1418816398

8761907,comment,8761183,8761183,0,0,sireat,,,"There is not much ebook piracy within Kindle ecosystem similarly as there is not much app piracy within iPhone ecosystem.<p>The piracy exists on both and is trivial for most readers of HN to perform, but for casual users of Kindle and iPhone it is a bit of pain.<p>Bezo is giving a particular viewpoint looking at the issue from Amazon Kindle window. That is, if you are a regular user of Amazon Kindle it will be very convenient for you to buy a licence to use e-books within Amazon ecosystem and relatively painful to pirate books.<p>If you are just a tiny bit technical you can easily strip Amazon DRM (used to be a simple Python script) for backup, in case Amazon decides to recall a particular book.<p>You can also pirate books on Kindle, but you will most likely need to convert books to Kindle format .mobi using Calibre unless you like reading misformatted pdfs. Again simple  but for someone who is not actively searching and is happy paying Amazon, not something they would do.<p>On the other hand if you are using a competitor&#x27;s device, it is relatively easy to find books to pirate in .epub format but the market share is much too small to matter.<p>I do not go out looking aggressively for pirate sites, but there are a few Russian based places(hint: library of biblical creation) where you can find pretty much any book released in the past 10 years, most books released in the past 10-20 years and some books released earlier. If you can&#x27;t find it on that Russian site you can find it in Indian or Chinese forums. I am sure there is American ebook pirate scene too but I did not pursue the matter.<p>So it is a combination of factors: Amazon being the market leader with its closed eco-system and ease of purchasing, the lack of clear poster child for e-book piracy since the demise of library.nu 2 years ago, the fragmentation of ebook pirate market.<p>Disclaimer: I own multiple e-readers including a Amazon Kindle DX demo model that I reflashed into a regular one.",1418815435

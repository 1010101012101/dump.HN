Every browser supports it natively, and the language has only gotten faster as client compilers get better.<p>Some tech to check out: \n- jQuery for DOM manipulation (interacting with HTML quickly and effectively)\n- Underscore.js for a nice toolkit of often-used utilities \n- node.js for running a server, which means you can have JS on both the client and the server. \n- Backbone.js/Angular.js/Ember.js (and others) are Javascript MV*s: that make large, single page apps like Pandora faster, more maintainable and easier to build.<p>Things to look forward to: \nECMAcsript 6 and 7 are in the works and include tons of new features: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript</a><p>ASM.js was recently created by Mozilla and it allows near-native speed using pure JS to run things like Unreal Engine inside the browser without the need for plugins: <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/asmjs-javascript-compile-target/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/asmjs-javascript-compile-target/</a><p>Even more standardization. IE has finally become a fairly standards compliant browser, so JS in this browser is very likely to work in any modern browser. Coding standards are also more common and are held to more often.<p>Personally, the worst thing about JS in the browser is that you have to deal with the DOM. The DOM is a smelly old piece of crap that acts differently in different browsers.",1368129472

Now, maybe these guys with guns are justified -- but that's strictly your opinion.</i><p>Strictly my opinion? Hardly. Some neo-liberals aside (and them constrained in the US) it's the opinion of most of the world. Some people want lower taxes, others disagree with specific tax laws, but statistically speaking, nobody is against taxes in toto. The issue does not even come into play into protests (except from bizarro minorities). People all over the world demand that their government is brought down, that they get better pay, they corrupted officials are punished, and tons of other things -- but ""no taxes"" is just not on the table.<p>><i>By definition, your definition is wrong. Non-democratic governments impose taxes as well.</i><p>Which is beside the point. Taxation WITHIN a democracy is voluntary and decided via the democratic process. That a dictatorship can also have taxation doesn't change this. A dictatorship can also maintain an educational system. That doesn't make it non democratic when a democracy maintains one.<p>><i>Why do you define ""voluntary"" relative to the political landscape?</i><p>For reasons obvious to any who accepts democracy and is not Ayn Rand? Because a dictatorship forces the people to do stuff, whereas in a democracy they get to vote for what they want to be done. That some people don't agree with the result it doesn't matter, as long as the majority of people agrees with the process -- ie. the polling for the aggregate popular opinion as expressed in presidential candidates and party platforms and representatives.<p>><i>You're telling me slavery never really happened in the US, because it was voluntary labor -- as decided by the ""democratic process""? Why do you defend slavery with such fervor?</i><p>Why do you insist in using BS non-sequiturs to make some bizarro point?<p>Slavery was not voluntary labor because the subjects of slavery weren't part of the democratic process that allowed it to happen.

Uniformly these were much lower quality, and consisted of defenses of the foundations of mathematics, rather than acknowledgements that there were real issues.  His criticisms were not taken seriously until that mathematical framework completely fell apart when Fourier series constructed ""obviously impossible"" things.<p>Today we are used to a very general notion of a ""function"".

Numba's purpose was and still remains best at allowing you to still write the ""hard-to vectorize"" algorithms that require for-loops without having to use C/C++ or Fortran.<p>If you never are resorting to using C/C++ or Fortran, then Numba is not necessarily going to be helpful for you.<p>I don't think we are trying to mislead.   We are simply showing examples that illustrate what Numba can be used for.   Of course your code does not have many for-loops in it because you never could write code like that and have it be fast in Python.   The big-deal about Numba is that now you can.  You don't have to rely on a C/C++ library that either write or get someone else to write for you.  You can just use Python.<p>I agree with you about the ""unrolling"".  I don't recommend adding for-loops when good vectorized expressions work.  Keep using them as we will be able to do a better job of parallelizing that code in the future.  However, when you can't vectorize and for-loops are all you have, Numba is great.<p>We have spent some time on optimizing NumPy expressions like you describe and some array expressions can be translated down to equivalent LLVM loops.  But most of the effort in that direction has been happening in the Blaze project which is generalizing NumPy so it can deal with much larger data but still produce optimized code from those vector expressions.    This actually requires a re-thinking of how NumPy is implemented from the ground up.",1368127613

It's probably more a reflection of:<p>(a) where these companies are in terms of product-market fit<p>(b) the companies applying an analytical, test-everything mindset to all aspects of marketing, including branding<p>Most startups at the stage that the article talks about (those in incubators or fresh out of them) are testing out various different messages to see which ones convert the most effectively. A/B testing the headers and supporting copy on your homepage is an obvious way to see which features & offerings are most compelling to visitors, so you'll see a lot of companies change their top-line messaging frequently as they learn more through their various sales and marketing channels and try out new positioning.<p>Also, the majority of these early-stage companies aren't entirely clear on the emotional and functional benefits that they're delivering. Figuring out the functional benefits is much easier-- we help you ""store your photos more securely,"" ""have a frictionless extra-marital affair,"" etc.--but clarity on the emotional side often comes later, as users develop a relationship with the company and start to give feedback.<p>With that said, I think most startups wildly underestimate the importance of branding and the role it can play in driving growth.

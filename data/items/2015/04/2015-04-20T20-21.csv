Those who made and used tools were more likely to survive/mate successfully, and those who made and used tools also tended to use them as eating utensils, which mechanically leads to an overbite. So eating with a fork doesn&#x27;t directly lead to being selected for survival, but it&#x27;s likely if you eat with utensils you also use other tools for things like hunting, defence, etc. and that does lead to increased survival.",1429563534

9410835,comment,9408162,9408452,0,0,bradleyland,,,"Ugh. First things first, you&#x27;re going to have to compartmentalize this issue, because it is unlikely that you&#x27;ll find a lawyer willing to give you any advice that is relevant in HK, the Philippines, and the US. I would focus on the US, unless you have specific need to travel to HK and the Philippines regularly. If you do have to travel to those locations, you should check your legal status in your destination country <i>before</i> traveling there. If you don&#x27;t respond to a lawsuit, the plaintiff may win by default, and you may find yourself entangled in a foreign legal system upon arrival.<p>With regard to the US, you still need to talk to a lawyer. In general, any agreement is invalid without &quot;consideration&quot;. That is, you can&#x27;t enter in to a one-sided agreement, and you can&#x27;t enter in to an agreement where the consideration occurred in the past. So even if you did sign a document right now, you&#x27;d be owed some consideration in order for it to be valid. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, which is why you really should spend the money to sit down with an attorney who practices business law and is within the jurisdiction in which you are being threatened (California).<p>It seems extremely unlikely that the plaintiff would be successful in this case, but I have some general advice for you. There&#x27;s a saying in the US that, &quot;You may beat the rap but you can&#x27;t beat the ride.&quot; This saying means that (in a criminal context) the charges against you may not hold up in court, but you&#x27;re still going for a ride in the back of a police car if you thumb your nose at authority. I really wish there were an equivalent for matters of civil law, because even a laughably bad lawsuit can cost significant sums of money to obtain a dismissal, or even worse, summary judgement.<p>I am on year 5 of litigation involving an agreement that A) I never signed, B) never saw, and C) was never a member of the company for which the agreement was made. I was dragged in to the suit on &quot;civil conspiracy&quot; charges, alledging that I knew of the agreement and conspired to assist the signor in breaking it. It has cost me a significant chunk of what would have otherwise been retirement savings. Everyone who sees the case (lawyer or otherwise) says that it&#x27;s ridiculous, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to stop the process from dragging on and on.<p>My advice is this: whatever you may be owed in this situation, weigh it against the fact that it sounds like you were involved with a litigious asshole. Don&#x27;t mire yourself down in the legal mud unless you absolutely have to. I&#x27;m not saying you should acquiesce to his demands, but don&#x27;t be cavalier about it either. Go talk to an attorney. Ask them to be brutally honest with you, and ask them all the &quot;what ifs&quot; you can think of. Evaluate what risks lie on the other side of a possible lawsuit, even if it is a frivolous one.",1429563509

It&#x27;s a somewhat popular trope, that there is an equivalence between Amy offending people and Bob asking her to stop.

They are good at certain types of repetitive unrelated (parallel) math. They can be good at simulating physics since physics is described with matrix math.<p>You could simulate the gates in a chip, though this is a MASSIVE problem and will tax the GPU for meh results. If you decided to simulate a chip in a GPU, simulating an FPGA would be quite pointless since FPGAs are less than optimal so they can be reconfigured to implement (not simulate) different chips.<p>This would be like running a Sparc emulator in a Java VM implementation of an Intel VM... mabe throw javascript in there somewhere. Each level of emulation, simulation, or implementation robs resources.<p>Yes those architectures are more open but they do not do the same thing. More work with those setups so, say, Postgres can offload certain math to the GPU, is great and should be done. But this is somewhat different than FPGAs (though in the same spirit).<p>CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs all solve different types of problems very well. But they do not run each other&#x27;s problems well, and certainly do not implement each other super well. Well, with one exception: you can build a reasonable GPU with shaders in an FPGA, but this is not to out perform the FPGA it is implemented on in a task.

Hopefully I would not follow the shit show that occasionally is the Chronos Group.<p>Some people will say that there are already pcie cards with fpgas on them and that this is not a new idea. But the issue is that existing cards like Digilent make are there for building pcie card designs. The FPGA (usually one) on the board has to implement the pcie fabric plus whatever it wants to do. Imagine if when you write an OpenGL/CL program you had to deal with all the DMA work and quirks of the underlying setup. 
Instead the grid of fpgas should have standard ways to access certain mapped regions of memory through a different chip that handles the PCIe transport layer stuff. If this was available then adding FPGA support into POSTGRES would not require bypassing the HAL of your kernel or worrying about timing details of something fundamental to modern computers (and thus software engineers) like PCIe.<p>Obviously the FPGA is still something that is hardware specific, but who knows what could be done with that. Even if we had to Synthesize from raw HDL every time, at least loading the chips would WORK. We could start using these chips to solve problems instead of thing slike a one off project by an EE major to build a grid of FPGAs that process bitcoin. The bitcoin work was impressive but it bothers me SO MUCH that they used reconfigurable devices to build a solid card with a fixed function.",1429562720

We&#x27;re performance artists, and the systems we program really only have meaning as long as we keep programming them (or, if we&#x27;re really lucky, someone else takes up the dance when we grow tired of it). Once we take our final bows, the programs will fade away and die and all that will be left is a memory of the performance.</i><p>Nah, it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way, although it often is.<p>We&#x27;re like artists or architects, but most of what we build isn&#x27;t lasting because there&#x27;s little demand for that, just as many architects will never get paid to work on anything that might last. The Sistene Chapel lasted; the slums of Rome from almost any era haven&#x27;t. For every artist whose work makes it into a museum, there are thousands hawking cheap prints on the streets of Paris.<p>Programmers can build software that will last for a long time. I know people whose programs are still running, untouched, after 30 years. We <i>can</i> solve problems and keep them solved.

Just as most architects are building clapboard houses in the suburbs, most of us get stuck writing throwaway code because The Business won&#x27;t pay for good code by giving us the autonomy and timeframes that&#x27;d enable it to exist. Of course, bad code and failed software projeects are far more costly in the long term, but executives are not a tribe known for thinking long term; most corporate climbers have the political skill to get promoted away from their externalized costs before anything can be linked to them.",1429562642

The inability to use most of the intermediate file formats for anything since they are secret formats is annoying. If I remember correctly it had dependencies on Java and Mono. The command line tools are archaic and very difficult to use even before realizing they are not documented out of the fear of giving something away about how anything works. The iMPACT for programming chips incorrectly loads the libusb.so file and has to be LD_PRELOADed on linux, but even then there is some weird race condition that makes it work 1 out of 4 times. In order to do anything you have to download and install 15 gigs of data and agree to aggressive licenses.<p>The compiler tool chain usually is a compiler and a linker. I could understand if you said that the place and route was more of a linker step, but people often call the full process &#x27;compilation&#x27;. The fact that stitching the modules together and actualizing the equivalent of addresses and instructions (in CPU terms) is a physical fitting and box packing problem in an FPGA does not make it a fundamentally disparate step to me.<p>Wow, I did not know that about the ARM compilers. I must have got the wrong impression from forum posts on the use of GCC for ARM chips. That makes me pretty happy, particularly that ARM is helping with the open tools. 
I will say though that this feels like it is supporting my point because people are using the non vendor tools. If support is a concern, support is not something that only a big company can provide. Postgres provides support and adds features on auction. I will admit that the responsiveness of Oracle for their customers having a need is much bigger and more organized, but it better be for what people pay for that. 
With the Oracle example, I think I am leaning towards &#x27;there will always be room for a proprietary solution to handle edge cases of a market&#x27; instead of open solutions will not work as well as proprietary ones and are unable to be the defacto standard.",1429561787

Unlike software, you can&#x27;t just push out a patch if there is a bug.  I mean, in theory, I guess you can since FPGAs are reconfigurable, but it is probably not very straightforward from a deployment point of view (I actually don&#x27;t know so feel free to correct me).<p>So, since you cannot push out fixes easily, it&#x27;s quite scary for the engineering teams to work with unproven tools.  For the consumer electronic space, product life-cycles are quite short (mobile phones get updated every year!).  So you definitely don&#x27;t want to risk cutting into your product&#x27;s time-to-market due to bugs in the FPGA tools.<p>Also, the bigger the company, the more likely that they will have high-priority direct-support from the FPGA Vendors. Whereas, it&#x27;s probably harder to get support for open-source tools.

This is a good use case for some where they prefer or require data to be encrypted up to the last minute (although it&#x27;s not the only way to do it).<p>TCP load balancing is neat for doing things like load balancing MySQL connections, which aren&#x27;t HTTP (although that&#x27;s not necessarily recommended according to some things I&#x27;ve read).<p>I believe, but can&#x27;t find the sources, that Nginx can be as efficient a load balancer as HAProxy.

I have spent a long time thinking about how the deluge of easy entertainment and shallow articles on the Internet has affected the way people operate. I&#x27;ve even done a similar experiment in the past, except in my case it was banning the Internet except for a specific set of use cases. It was certainly an interesting experience.<p>One warning I will throw out for those considering entertainment/distraction deprivation: you will need something to spend your time on. Instead of just taking away, use the same opportunity to try to cultivate a productive habit (hey, you&#x27;re going to be suffering anyway -- might as well).<p>Also, you need to think about whether this really addresses the issues that cause you to be &quot;mediocre&quot;/lazy/unproductive. It&#x27;s easy to blame external factors like the Internet for providing easy entertainment, but it&#x27;s also important to look inward and see if you have mental roadblocks that are inhibiting you -- perhaps you are mentally exhausted from work, or maybe you just aren&#x27;t interested. Also, I&#x27;ve started to think that some people are just flat out less productive than others. Or to put it another way, some people are abnormally productive. After all, productivity is really more of a means than an end. If you&#x27;re not sure where you are going, it doesn&#x27;t matter how fast you get there. And if you do have a goal, abstract ideas like quality or productivity are quickly redefined in more concrete terms to fit your new intention.",1429560500

Lauterbach&#x27;s[1] Trace32 for instance don&#x27;t even have software keys, the license for their very extensive debugging software is stored in the dongle itself.<p>Another piece of software that isn&#x27;t often mentioned in these discussions is the driver for the embedded flash memory inside parts. USB has quite poor latency (1ms) and flash peripherals require quite a few read-modify-write operations, which soon adds up. More expensive JTAG dongles can run these operations locally on the dongle, with USB just for bulk data transfers, or even download and run code on the target itself for even lower latency, greatly increasing download speed. Since this software needs to be tested for each target, requiring a physical chip to be bought, this gets very expensive to develop. Even a &quot;cheap&quot; dongle like the Segger J-Link has an incredibly long list of targets[2], and I suspect a substantial amount of the purchase price is in engineering and testing flash drivers for those.<p>ARM seem to be trying to solve some of these problems in the ARM world with CMSIS-DAP[3], an open standard for JTAG/SWD dongles USB protocol. It uses USB HID, so no drivers should be needed on any platform, and they have even created an Apache licensed implementation[4], which Freescale are now using in their FRDM boards.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.lauterbach.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lauterbach.com/</a>

I also architected and built a LBaaS product at a well-known hosting provider using HAproxy. I didn&#x27;t arrive at that conclusion by misreading the documentation and I stand by it. It&#x27;s also not a knock of HAproxy, it&#x27;s just a reflection that being intelligent about HTTP is not HAproxy&#x27;s primary use case. It is awesome for TCP and I exclusively use HAproxy to balance TCP in a protocol-agnostic way.<p>First, doing anything intelligent with HTTP slaughters HAproxy&#x27;s performance by an order of magnitude because of the way you must configure it. Second, sticking requests to a backend is easy if you have a <i>header</i> that you want to decide upon. If you want to elect a different backend based upon a path component, this is much harder and yields an unwieldy configuration.<p>HAproxy is not designed to operate extensively on HTTP. It is designed to balance quickly and efficiently, and grew HTTP intelligence because people started wanting the convenience of making HAproxy do far more than its core focus. Rather than HAproxy getting smarter about HTTP, I&#x27;d much rather have the protocols that service my applications handle themselves and use HAproxy for its bread and butter, TCP availability and balancing. I can then focus on optimizing that using HAproxy&#x27;s really clever mechanisms, like keeping the entire TCP conversation in kernel memory without reading it out (which you must do to &quot;be powerful,&quot; as you say). This also means if I want to support SPDY or HTTP/2 or Websockets, I&#x27;m not waiting for HAproxy to support them because I painted myself in a corner.<p>The stack I&#x27;ve deployed at the frontend of every startup I&#x27;ve ever consulted for or operated looks like this:<p><pre><code>          /- [haproxy AZ A] -- [openresty AZ A]
    [ELB] -- [haproxy AZ B] -- [openresty AZ B]
          \- [haproxy AZ C] -- [openresty AZ C]
</code></pre>
This is my Standard Frontend Deployment A. My other Standard Frontend Deployment, B, is if I have the budget and comprises Netscalers because of my experience with them from Google and other companies. Startup/low budget, ELB/haproxy/openresty. High budget, Netscaler and done.<p>We are speaking to years of my own operational experience.

These are habits or personality traits that my close friends and family wouldn&#x27;t be aware of, but that my girlfriend has exclusive access to as the one with whom I share the most intimate details of my life. She forces me to reflect on why I am the way that I am; sometimes directly when we fight, but often indirectly through her questions and observations.<p>I&#x27;d like to think that our relationship has made us more empathetic and introspective. I don&#x27;t think it has made me any less extreme in my ideals though.<p>My personal view is that extremism is generally bred by a low standard of living and a high degree of economic inequality that is forced onto a united group of people that feel like they deserve more than the system has given them. The uniting factor could be race, religion, age - anything, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>I&#x27;ve recently been struggling with the notion that, as a 22-year old who is about to graduate, I am to enter an economy and a system set up and controlled entirely by the captains of finance and government who allowed the financial crisis of 2007 to occur, and who have been unable to &quot;fix&quot; the economy through monetary and fiscal reform. This has pushed me towards the study of Bitcoin, a &quot;radical&quot; tool that traditional economists are quick to dismiss as a libertarian/anarchist fantasy. I don&#x27;t subscribe to any political viewpoint - I simply see a broken system that has destroyed the lives of many of the constituents that it was created to serve through corruption and negligence. Bitcoin is just another tool, such as Quantitative Easing and Interest rate manipulation, that we could possibly implement to reduce the volatility of the financial system and remove some of its susceptibility to greed and corruption.<p>My interest in Bitcoin nothing compared to ISIS, the PLO, the Black Panthers, or any other minority group that was oppressed and decided to try and change a system that it found unfair and stacked against it. The difference is that these &quot;extremist&quot; groups use violence to fight their battles, because they see the alternative life of dying poor and oppressed as a non-option.<p>If we were to advance every civilization to a point where the standard of living was high enough and the measure of inequality was low enough, I think we could eradicate most forms of physically violent extremism. Mental &quot;extremism&quot; in the form of thought-experiments pushing the boundaries of the current system would continue, but to the benefit of society in general. Will this ever happen?

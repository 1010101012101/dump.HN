The constraint of school is useful, in that in terms of productivity, feeling like you don't have enough time is better than feeling like you have plenty of time.  You just have to learn how to make the most of the time that you do have--which isn't easy or intuitive--because you'll need that skill no matter what you do later.",1229899950

The preface of a good book will generally talk about a few abstract themes which guide the exposition. The preface of a poor book will be a sort of random collection of notes, ideas, and guidelines.

A model has components, each one of which corresponds to something in the world."" The book was, unsurprisingly, no good.<p>In a similar way, Java's verbosity in even the simplest examples speaks to a certain kind of language design.

I've been working on a few startups for a couple years, exited a few things (not for a lot), working in PHP and now Rails, and it's far more exciting than hs.<p><a href=""http://markbao.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://markbao.com</a> (old, somewhat crappy stuff there, new stuff <a href=""http://files.markbao.com/newstuff.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.markbao.com/newstuff.jpg</a>)<p>I'm not thinking about dropping out, though. The risk <i>is</i> too great to just drop out and work on startups. I'm trying to make the most out of my little time left as a teenager socially and educationally (albeit the subject matter is relatively less useful than I'd like), go to college with a business focus (if I can get in with my low-ball GPA), and see where it goes from there.<p>I'm mostly in the startup game now to make connections, understand a foundation of startup business and entrepreneurship, and then move on in the future with that knowledge as an advantage.<p>For any other high school people on HN: there are three laws to follow when you're attending a strict-time institution like HS:<p><pre><code>  - Bust your ass.\n  - Manage your time correctly.\n  - Being under 18 doesn't make you special if you don't do special things. i.e.,\n    have credentials and work to back yourself up, and forget about age for a bit.\n</code></pre>\nLearning how to manage my time and bust my ass (both of which are like hand in glove) have helped me highly in managing schoolwork plus a few startups (Avecora/Avecora OnDemand/AdSocial, Ramamia, TickrTalk, DebateWare, Classleaf.)<p>In fact, school gives you an interesting time constraint and <i>advantage</i>. 37signals, who used to be a consultancy, had just 10 hours a week to work on Basecamp. And you know what they did? They <i>busted their ass.</i> And what came out of it was how to use time efficiently, embracing constraints.

You're not special if you're under 18. You've developed an application, and you've developed coding skills a few years before people generally do. What separates you from the general young entrepreneur press and YOU is a few years. Don't kid yourself into thinking you're all special because you can code @app, because in the long run, without actual skills and knowledge you're hurting yourself. There are some people who put on the façade of ""Wow, you're a high school entrepreneur, that's so awesome. So what do you do?"" but see through that and it's not really genuine most of the time. It took me a bit of time to figure out that <i>nobody really gives much of a shit</i>, so learn that.

200957,comment,200907,200907,0,0,thorax,,,"Some of our users had the same concerns when we made our site featurelist.org. That's why we  added (due to a user's feature request) a way to export all data from your project to XML.<p>Without exports like that, users will become even more wary of storing their data on sites that aren't supported by the ""big 5"" internet/software companies. There's always the risk the company (or handful of hackers) will go away and take their hard work with them. It's also a differentiator when you do that because the big guys want to hold onto the data.<p>Obviously an XML dump is not the same as having the full service, but at least, if bad things happen, the users can salvage some of their content without digging through Google/wayback caches.",1211896544
200956,comment,200882,200882,0,0,swombat,,,"Lame article. First of all, that system (I've tried it) sucks. It requires constant attention and effort. I'd be surprised to meet anyone who's male and can be bothered to count their calories every day for more than 1 or 2 weeks (though some girls seem to manage, but they <i>really care</i>). You won't lose much weight in 1-2 weeks, so this system will only result in making you feel bad for yet again failing to lose any significant weight.<p>As I propose in my article here: <a href=""http://www.inter-sections.net/2008/01/02/feedback/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inter-sections.net/2008/01/02/feedback/</a> - you need a good, timely, but also <i>effortless</i> system of feedback. Something that requires you to carry a notepad and add up numbers every day is a still-born failure.<p>The system that worked extremely well for me was much simpler: weigh yourself every day (including body fat %). Plot that on a grid, and that'll provide you motivation enough to keep your calorie intake down.<p>As an engineer, you should be aware that there's a few key vital behaviours that, if you implement them, typically make all the difference. According to various food associations, there's 3 vital behaviours for losing weight:<p>- Weigh yourself every day<p>- Eat breakfast every day<p>- Have a way to exercise at home<p>Since I lost 10kg in 3 months by doing just 2 out of those 3 (but going heavy on the ""weigh yourself"" bit by actually charting my weight and BF%), I can say that it certainly seemed to work for me.",1211896341

200952,comment,200797,200797,0,0,jcromartie,,,"The biggest problem that I see with this idea is a social one, and not an economic one.  It can be summed up in one word:<p>Pride.<p>Just look at how tenaciously consumers cling to SUVs and large luxury cars, even though they surely know better.  People who can't even afford decent food or housing spend ridiculous amounts of money on excessive vehicles.<p>I'd imagine you'll have to pry the wheels of their gas-guzzlers from their cold dead hands before they get in some cheap, mass-produced, plain-vanilla electric transportation, virtually devoid of status and ""bling.""",1211895915

Pharmaceuticals are very risky.<p>House: You know what else is risky? NOT BREATHING. That has some minor side effects such as DEATH. Your doctor, after carefully weighing all the options, decided that NOT BREATHING is more dangerous than [insert minor side effect of pills].<p>(Paraphrased, I don't remember the exact lines.)",1211895847

Designing and analyzing one can be a fairly interesting and/or educational process (and all part of the process of public crypto research, which is what this is about).<p>Developers, by all means, should use AES and not some random unproven cipher.

Clean coal is a rapidly growing area in electricity production and nuclear production continues to increase.<p>Having to create electricity to meet our energy demand is a fantastic problem to have.  Energy independence should be an economic goal of any developed country.  You don't want ANY foreign control of 7% of your GDP, let alone a cartel like OPEC.",1211895321

These employers make deliberately ridiculous recruiting efforts so they can prove to the INS there are no domestic candidates and they need worker visas.  They post the ads in tiny low circulation classified sections and then come up with specious disqualifications for any domestic applicants.<p>This smells just like a case last year where a PR piece pushing liberal immigration law backfired.  A guy who owned a lawn service company did his bit for the cause blathering on about how he couldn't get ANYONE domestic to work for him for something like $10/hour.  He needed illegals.  Well it turned out, he wasn't advertising anywhere and was just directly recruiting illegals.  When this piece got even a little circulation native born Americans were lined up around the block asking him for work.",1211895155

And at that point do you do a ""52-pickup"" and refactor, make the best of what you have, or continue working the way you were?<p>I used to do this, but haven't for a long time. I was really suprised when I got into this same mess a year or two ago writing a system that had multiple datasources and multiple valid object graphs.<p>Looking at this from the distance of a year or more, my mistake was in paradigms. I really should have went totally functional with the project instead of trying a classic OOP-tiering structure. Because my head was in the wrong place, I was like a guy with a square peg trying to get it into a round hole -- I just kept thinking I needed a bigger hammer.<p>Now I could have still kept an OO mentality and solved the problem -- no doubt about it. But that would have required more design up front than I gave it. So in this case lack of sufficient thinking up front combined with my head being in the wrong space caused the code base to be a lot more jumbled than it should have been.",1211893631

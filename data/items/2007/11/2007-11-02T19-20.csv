75566,comment,75414,75541,0,0,sethjohn,,,"Both the National Academy of Sciences and the IPCC are essentially political organizations (in the sense that their purpose is to inform policy, I don't mean to suggest that they are partisan) and what they say should not be conflated with the scientific literature on climate change. <p>Scientists are working very hard to understand past and future climate change, but it is an incredibly complex problem. (For analogy, can political scientists predict who will be elected president in 2012?...it's possible to make some good guesses but there are a lot of factors and it's hard to know what will happen.)<p>Sure, there is general agreement on some points and organizations such as the IPCC are doing a noble job of trying to synthesize the mountains of complex science into a  few simple statements, but I think you are drastically oversiplifying the case when you say that<p>""99.99% of the world's scientists, based on careful interpretation of many thousands of peer-reviewed studies, agree that global warming is real, and is caused by human activity. A vanishingly small handful of scientists happen to disagree with this assessment, based mostly upon their opinion and politics.""",1194033330

75564,comment,75414,75546,0,0,anamax,,,"The ""cures"" are frightfully expensive.  The mitigations and costs are less so.  (The ""cures"" do get less expensive as technology develops, but Stern didn't include that factor.)<p>Read the Stern report.  Notice the discount rate.  (Stern does argue that it's appropriate to spend $100 now to avoid spending $95 in the future.)<p>Or, maybe you want to argue that Stern is wrong about the economics.<p>I think that he is, but not in a way that strengthens his conclusion that we should apply the cures now.  (Yup - he's an AGW advocate and a commonly cited source for the economic argument.)<p>",1194033200

75562,comment,75158,75471,0,0,jpuskarich,,,"For your particular search, ""Dell Inspiron Laptop"", I would expect our current product to return a bunch of batteries and accessories.  Only because Dell sells computers like J. Crew sells clothes. That is, if you want to buy a J. Crew Sweater, your best bet is to walk into a J. Crew store.<p>Sony is a different case.  You'll see their systems at many retailers. So, if you search ""Sony Vaio""- <a href=""http://bountii.com/search.php?item=sony+vaio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bountii.com/search.php?item=sony+vaio</a> , you'll find our results are more than adequate.  <p>The major strength of current product is that it is great at finding the best prices for people who know what they want.  We're in the process of improving our browsing capability as that's the way a lot of people like to shop. And, since we also want that to be one of our big strengths, we'll have to include ""Dell Inspiron Laptops"" from Dell in our index.<p>-John",1194032776

The older big software companies (Oracle, Adobe, MSFT) seem to have been stuck between 20 and 40 for a while now.  I conclude based on this rigorous analysis that Google's eventual ideal P/E is around 30, and that investor hype has inflated its value by around $110B, or about 1% of US annual GDP.",1194032687

We plan on implementing a lot more to this concept!<p>Again, thank you everyone for your comments and honesty!<p>

This is a sales tool, you labeling it as something that's related to marketing makes it clear you're not part of the demographics. ",1194032083

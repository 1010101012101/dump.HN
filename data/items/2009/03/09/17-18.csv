508752,comment,507467,508334,0,0,IgorCarron,,,"The convex optimization is used to reconstruct the original signal.<p>The underlying compressive sensing theory says that if you do a measurement of a sparse signal, then convex optimization should allow you to recover that signal with high to overwhelming probability. The reason compressive sensing is interesting is that:\n- the process of taking measurement is linear (no iteration a la JPEG), thereby allowing one to foresee very low powered sensors.\n- the number of measurements is expected to be much smaller than what the Nyquist-Shannon theorem says (Nyquist is just a sufficient condition, not a necessary one), thereby realizing a de-facto compression of the signal with no a priori on the shape of that signal (except the knowledge that it is sparse) \n- the measurements are automatically encrypted.<p>In the case of the broad-spectrum communications monitor, the message is known to be sparsely located all over the frequencies.<p>Igor.",1236621569

508732,comment,508465,508465,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>For people who are just reading a book at home, however, print will do just fine. For linear reading, Kindle offers no advantages and, for nonlinear content, has many disadvantages — so why pay $359 more?</i><p>I disagree here.  Reading is only one aspect of the experience, the other aspect is the convenience of purchasing books.  I am really bad about buying books.  I don't quite understand why -- there are lots that I want to read.  But when it comes down to paying $30 and waiting a week for shipping (or paying more for 2 day shipping), I put orders off indefinitely.  This is bad, because time I should spend reading books ends up as time spent watching TV or playing video games.<p>I thought buying a Kindle might break this cycle, and it in fact did.  I've had a Kindle for under a week, and I've already finished two books.  I don't think I've even cared about TV all week.  Making reading very convenient (and pleasurable) was well worth the $350.<p>(I also travel a lot, and end up bringing two books on every trip so I don't run out of reading material.  That is a lot of unnecessary weight to carry around, and I often finish both books fairly quickly anyway.  The Kindle is very light, and I can easily buy another book wherever I am.  I have not been on a trip with my Kindle yet, but I think I can say goodbye to boredom during unexpected delays.)<p>Finally, the Kindle delivers an experience I have always wanted -- doing something useful from the couch.  I like my couch, but I could never get comfortable with my computer there.  I always end up wanting my nice keyboard or 24"" monitor, rather than my tiny eeepc (or larger Thinkpad).  So I never compute (or read) from the couch.  The Kindle changes this; I can email it a PDF (or buy a book from Amazon), and then read it from my couch.  This has multiple benefits; I can't get distracted by anything, since I'm physically away from my computer and desk, and it's also really comfortable.  (The Kindle is lighter than the books I usually read, so there is less fatigue.  Yeah, maybe I am just really out of shape.)<p>There are only two drawbacks -- it is very hard to skim things, and the PDF conversion doesn't handle diagrams or math formulae very well.  This isn't a deal-breaker, but there's no reason why it shouldn't work.",1236620962

I would do it again, but the financial instability is still extremely stressful, particularly as I enter my mid-thirties.  It's always feast or famine.<p>My observations:<p>1. Pay off debt as quickly as you can.  When you're broke again, you'll be grateful you did.<p>2. Never put all of your eggs in one basket. When you only have one or two major sources of revenue (or clients), you're as dependent as an employee, but considerably less secure.<p>3. No matter how unnecessary it may seem, have a real, legally binding contract for any work you commit to do. I thought I did.  I was wrong.<p>4. Budget for marketing.  You can't depend on viral marketing alone.<p>5. Have health insurance.  It's expensive and you can't afford it, and I know you're young and healthy, but when your appendix decides it's time to come out, you'll be on the hook for about $22,000.<p>6.

Do es it really know exactly what the right action is when you try to merge a patch with a renamed and modified file with a patch deleting that same file?

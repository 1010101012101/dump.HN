6309210,comment,6308955,6308955,6,0,adamzerner,,,"1) I think socializing is overrated, and doing work that is meaningful to you is underrated.<p>2) It&#x27;s really all about balance.  You probably need a good mixture of the following to be happy: socializing, exercise, work, alone time.  A lot of times situations occur where you have to sacrifice one area for another.  Like with a startup, you probably have to work a lot more and won&#x27; have time for other things.  For this reason, I think startup life is unsustainable (because it&#x27;ll probably make you sacrifice too much socializing/alone time/exercise).  However, the upsides of startups are still great, and I think worthwhile, so I think it&#x27;d make sense to make a ton of money from a startup after working for a few years, and then rebalance your life afterwards and benefit from the money.<p>3) Friendships seem to be a function of repeated, unplanned interactions, and of situations that encourage you to let your guard down.   <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&pagewanted=all&adxnnlx=1362981828-IFeaWGqBlRzRM6qmewLA6g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-m...</a>.

True. But it is an obstruction of justice, and it seems pretty clear that some people were soliciting his services to cover up non-polygraph crimes.<p>For example, providing false identification to members of the Zetas drug cartel is definitely a crime (and, considering their penchant for bloodshed, a pretty despicable one). It&#x27;s also whether the &quot;convicted sex offenders&quot; used his training to avoid capture for additional crimes (which would make him something of an accomplice).<p>Just not clear how we could defend a man who knowingly trained people doing some pretty nefarious things.",1378011177

6309206,comment,6309008,6309008,45,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"Here&#x27;s the advantage of C99&#x27;s bool. Lots of C projects do something like this:<p><pre><code>    typedef char bool;
</code></pre>
and then maybe they use it like so:<p><pre><code>    bool found_it = strstr(haystack, needle);
</code></pre>
This has a serious bug that will only manifest 0.4% of the time. The problem is that strstr returns a pointer, and converting a pointer to a smaller integer type throws away the high bytes. If the resulting pointer is not NULL but happens to have a zero low byte, this bool will be false, even though the string was found.<p>Even if that doesn&#x27;t happen, you&#x27;ll often see code like this:<p><pre><code>    #define true 1
    ...
    if (found_it == true) ...
</code></pre>
which is wrong as well.<p>bool addresses these. Conversions to bool always result in values of 0 or 1, so both of the above problems are avoided.<p>That said, I agree with Linus. It&#x27;s not well understood, and using bool in a library header may conflict with another definition of bool in the project. Also, compilers typically warn about at least the first error above. As a C99 feature, bool is too little, too late; had it been part of C89, things might be different.",1378011151

Other reports imply that there was little contact between the islands, so they likely didn&#x27;t trade for all that material. Figure a 4 cm across, and 5 km of pipe gives 6 cubic meters of lead or 70 tons of lead, which is a full load on a Spanish caravel of the 1400s. And I think I&#x27;m underestimating that number.<p>I tried to find more historical information. The Spanish Wikipedia page points out that a well with brackish water was dug between 1702 and 1704, as part of a search to find drinkable water near the coast. It also commented that Columbus stopped there on his voyages to the Americas.<p>So I looked up a translation of the log of his first voyage. The entry for 9 Aug 1492 says:<p>> The Admiral says that many honourable Spaniards, inhabitants of the island of Hierro, swore that they were on Gomera with Dofia Inez Peraza, mother of Guillen Peraza, who was afterward the first Count of Gomera, and that each year they saw land to the west of the Canaries<p>&quot;Many&quot; is not helpful, but at least a few hundred people on the island?<p>I looked backwards in time. Jean IV de Bthencourt conquered the Canaries for Spain in the early 1400. &quot;There was no resistance offered by the scattered guanche population who were largely sold as slaves&quot; says Wikipedia. Nice guy.<p>Your best bet I think is to look for records in Spanish. Oh! I found &quot;Conquista y antiguedades de las islas de Gran Canaria y su descripcion: con muchas advertencias de sus privilegios, conquistadores, pobladores, y otras particularidades en la muy poderosa isla de Tenerife&quot;, dated 1676,<p>My Spanish is rather poor, but I think page 59 of <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=cKvrI2UF-LgC&pg=PA59&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U08RZ14esuFu7FPzYidt6kbigs3tg&ci=486%2C40%2C378%2C339&edge=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=cKvrI2UF-LgC&pg=PA59&img=1&...</a> says there were 1,800 inhabitants of El Hierro.<p>Here&#x27;s what I could copy from that text (updating the syntax to more modern Spanish):<p>La isla del Hierro esta diez y ocho leguas de Tenerife, es pequea, tiene su Villa con buena Parroquia, y dos Beneficiados, que acuden a toda la isla y algunos Capellanes; ay vn Conaento de San Francisco; cogese much trigo, y ganado; rendra la isla mil y ochocientos vecinos, y muchos principales.<p>Here&#x27;s my+Google&#x27;s translation:<p>El Hierro is eighteen leagues from Tenerife, is small, has its Villa with good parish, and two Beneficiaries, who flock to the island and some chaplains; (also a convent of??) St. Francis; grows(?) much wheat, and cattle; the island (has?) 1,800 residents, and many (bosses? people who can represent your business interest?).<p>So, a 1670 population of about 1,800 people, under the Spanish crown, and before the 1702 well.

This said, if you&#x27;re only going to be a technical filter, some companies will put your services against a combo of &quot;recruiters + codility&quot;.<p>I personally went through codility myself for a company, and I found it decent, even though it has obvious disadvantages because of being online.<p>That said, if you feel like targeting bigger companies, I believe you should introduce yourself (or whatever company you&#x27;re building) as a recruiter, but a strongly technical one, and then adapt your business model this way. It will scare companies less (newness equals risk), and it will make what you&#x27;re bringing on the table more clear. Your value is in your technical skills.<p>I understand that the difference in your offering is that you&#x27;re not offering companies to find candidates for them, but this is where you would become more useful than a method consisting of sending all the candidates to a service like codility.<p>All in all, I would use your services, but only if you solve a problem that my current tooling (recruiters I deal with, and online filtering services) can not solve, which does not look to be the case if I look at your current proposition.",1378008323

6309106,comment,6304752,6308994,2,0,einhverfr,,,"> So in the US, how do you propose to deal with the fact that a Muslim will get punished under terrorism laws for advocating we kill Christians, but a Christian will not get punished for advocating we kill Muslims?<p>Well, it is worse than that, unfortunately.  I think the answer is to strengthen first amendment protections rather than erode them.  We have fewer problems I think than we tend to see in Europe in this regard, but with Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, I think we have a real problem.<p>That problem is that now first amendment rights depend in part on who you are talking to.  If you tell the KKK, &quot;we will need to kill black Muslims&quot; that&#x27;s different from telling Hamas, &quot;You are right, we need to kill white Christians.&quot;  The difference is that fully domestic terrorism is protected while foreign organizations are not.  I think Holder v. HLP should have come out the other way because I do not think that is just.<p>> I believe placing limits on genocide advocacy is good for society (and the same for other comparably violent kinds of speech).<p>But surely &quot;Someday the workers must rise up and forcibly take control of the government&quot; qualifies if anything does, right?  So distributing Marxist literature would certainly be outside of the protections of the 1st Amendment.  That is exactly what was at issue in Yates and what the court said there was that there was a difference between saying that something would be desirable, and trying to make that same thing happen through tangible steps of preparation.  It&#x27;s one thing to say &quot;the 2nd Amendment protects a right to rebel.&quot;  It is something very different to add &quot;and that is why I am training my private army.&quot;  The rules which protect the Communists protect the NRA and I think more voices are generally good for discussion.",1378008158

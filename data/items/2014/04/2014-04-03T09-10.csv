7521846,comment,7519991,7520506,12,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"I understand why we have dual-class share structures. There are cases in which investors may trust management more than their fellow shareholders.<p>Yet I am concerned about the structures&#x27; dynastic qualities. Larry Page is a competent executive. That may not be the case in 40 years. Tom Perkins&#x27;s letter to the editor comes to mind [1]. The question of what happens after Page is more troubling. Limiting control to the founders&#x27; offspring is concerning. Granted, there are valid counterexamples. Warren Buffett is as old as he is wise. And Samsung seems to be plodding along just fine despite its family&#x27;s feuds.<p>But shareholders should have input into these issues. Perhaps the super-voting stock lapses to normal stock after its original recipient&#x27;s demise. Or maybe non-voting shareholders have one right: the right to call and vote on motions of no-confidence. Such motions, if passed by a super-majority of subordinated voters, would collapse the super-voting stock to normal stock.<p>Aristocracy runs thick in the veins of European business. It is worrying that we may be sprouting our own contractually-annointed Silicon Valley royalty.<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304549504579316913982034286"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230454950...</a>",1396519181

The longer more explicit code might end up shorter and more performant after it is compiled (like in the oldskool performance increasing trick of unrolling loops)<p>Or it might be less performant. If you actually care about this, you should have an automated test running regularly that will tell you one way or the other. But most of the time it&#x27;s not worth worrying about such things.<p>> 2.When you come back to your fancy code later you may have forgotten about that particular fancy trick and now you dont understand your code.\n> 3. Other people are less likely to understand your code.<p>Or using fancy tricks more frequently can help you remember them. I think you should use every feature available in the language - developers need to be able to understand the language so that they can read third-party library code. Or else have an automated system that flags usage of particular features.<p>> 4. By using more specialised features in a langauge your code is now less transportable to other langauges.<p>Who cares? Seriously, how likely is this to actually come up? If you&#x27;ve chosen language X you presumably had a good reason for doing so; you should write language X, not try and write language Y in language X.<p>Fewest lines of code is not the perfect metric, but I think it hits the sweet spot: it&#x27;s very simple to calculate, and captures a good proportion of the difference between good code and bad code.",1396518480

The company&#x27;s profits will go to everyone - bondholders, suppliers, customers, employees - except the shareholders. This will continue until liquidation, at which point the shareholders will be impaired or wiped out.<p>If a stock has value, voting or not, someone expects dividends. Investors may think management is bluffing - then both classes of stock would receive the same dividends. Or they may think they can coerce management into paying a dividend. This would create a contest of control. A temporary spread between the two classes would emerge. The contest of control has two possible outcomes. Management could forever resist the shareholders, in which the value of <i>both</i> classes is zero. Or shareholders could win, pay a dividend and restore parity between the classes.<p>Why does Google say it will never pay dividends? Because our markets punish growth companies acknowledging slowing growth. Announcing dividends is a sign of slowing growth. It seems like a specific type of investor invests in growth companies. When growth slows those investors hand their shares over to a different set of investors, value investors. The trade-off is tricky, and often involves proxy fights and management changes.",1396517236

Largely because of latency (from seek), which as yesterday&#x27;s HN article noted, is something you&#x27;re stuck with.<p>You can increase your CPU capacity through palatalization (up to Amdahl&#x27;s limit), but disk sucks no matter what.  Yes, with multiple channels you get better overall throughput, but if you need two blocks that aren&#x27;t contiguous but are on the same media, you&#x27;ve just bought an eternity in compute time.<p>SSD cracks that barrier, and does it pretty spectactularly, so yes, it&#x27;s been a pretty big breakthrough.<p>The next phase may well be localization of a lot of services which are now centrally web-hosted.  While in aggregate, people need a lot of compute power, individually, it&#x27;s not much, and tools such as the FreedomBox offer the opportunity to put that close to you, while distributing data for both data integrity and thwarting surveillance (it&#x27;s tough to run centralized surveillance over a decentralized architecture).<p>Round-trip time for SAAS is itself significant, as is browser load.  Cracking both these nuts for the ultimate in edge-provisioned networks (the wall wart 6 feet from where you sit), and a movement away from browser-based apps to a lighter-weight frameworks which is based on network transport but doesn&#x27;t impose a full browser overhead.",1396516243

They could fork off SQLite and change the SQL query syntax (parser) to whatever the W3C finds suitable.<p>Mozilla Firefox and FirefoxOS both already ship SQLite for years and can be accessed by its internal JavaScript API. And several Microsoft products already use it anyway (e.g. Forza Xbox games). Microsoft has of course also various other SQL database libraries like MS Access JetRed (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine</a> ), MS Outlook JetBlue (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine</a> ) and MS SQL Server Express (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Express"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Express</a> ) the SQL backend originally forked off for WinFS for Longhorn (Vista beta). It would be trivial for Microsoft to choose one of its many SQL engines and add it to IE 12. The same goes for Mozilla (just expose the API).<p>For some reason Oracle and Mozilla pushed IndexedDB. Oracle has conflicting interests, as it owns OracleDB(SQL), MySQL (SQL) and BerkeleyDB (NoSQL and now also SQL support, based on SQLite). Oracle is an official &quot;sponsor&quot; of SQLite development and even ships it as part of it&#x27;s BerkeleyDB package: <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/overview/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technolo...</a><p>One can speculate that a less powerful HTML5 API translates in the long run to more SQL server licenses for Oracle and Microsoft. If the web app devs cannot do the processing & storage on the client side, one has to do it on the server side.<p>Anyway, I hope that we get a SQL API for HTML 5.x that also Mozilla and/or Microsoft implements.

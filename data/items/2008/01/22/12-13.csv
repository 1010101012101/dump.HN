102157,comment,101969,102008,0,0,Tichy,,,"For hash tables you need to compute the hash function and execute an equals operation. Computing the hash function might take longer than traversing a tree. For example, if you key is ""sdolkfhasodfgkokjhdfgfnaryksfdksfdgkjgf"" the hash function will probably take every single letter into account (>20 operations, didn't count), whereas a binary tree might only need to look at the first letter at most nodes. So at least for relatively few entries, trees might perform better than hashtables, O(1) nonwithstanding.",1201004678

Then it just burns through the blog-sphere like a wildfire before burning out.

But my experience has been to the contrary: Because I have met a lot of different people and done a lot of different things I tend to have a broader perspective on things. And nobody has ever held anything I have done against me.<p>So my point stands: Just do it...",1201003614

If you're anywhere else in the country, the pay is generally abyssmal compared to the responsibility and the stress.  In what other industry can you work 12 hours straight and barely have time to go urinate, much less eat a lunch.  At one point in my career I could eat a Big Mac in under 45 seconds.  Why?  Because I had to.  That's literally all the time I had to eat.<p>I'm not leaving nursing to go work in a cube farm.  I'm leaving nursing to be a serial entrepreneur.  I'll be able to work 2 or 3 days a week, and spend the rest of my time coding and starting a business until I can get paid enough to devote full time to the business.<p>So, what is the worst that can happen to this young man?  Taking a year off to live off of savings to start a web app.  Please, if I have no imagination, tell me what your worst case scenario is.",1201003422

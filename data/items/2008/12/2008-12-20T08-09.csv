However academic hierarchies won't tolerate paying elevated salaries to people with lesser paper qualifications just because they are talented.  So every year you get the people who want a bit of cash on the side, but aren't yet good enough to do part-time contracting.",1229763408

404423,comment,402274,402665,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Now that I reread that, you're totally wrong. Angels are individual investors. They can and often do participate in equity rounds. They often contribute the entire amount. You can have an angel-funded series A. VCs could also do a convertible. It's called venture debt and it's rare but it happens.<p>No company that I've ever heard of specifies in their Articles what amount forces a future round to be equity rather than debt. It's all up to the company and investors. If your lawyers told you all of that stuff, seek new representation.",1229763184

I'm not sure exactly, but I suspect that it would be entirely within the realm of reasonable possibility for two equal groups of 250 to end up 5 points apart with an SD of 15. You could find out pretty easily with a script and a Gaussian RNG function if you were so inclined. My curiosity on this one is just slightly overpowered by my laziness though.",1229762435

They could learn a thing or two from other states.<p>The same goes for you, California.<p>Also, I wonder how many of the budget ""cuts"" are actually just reductions in the amount of planned increases.

The sites administration has now been made aware of it and have, rightfully, since fixed it. Their intentions seem honest as a link was provided to the original content.

404412,comment,404356,404404,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Law tries to increase the cost of the practice by penalizing those who participate. Slavery is impossible to eradicate in a society that is beyond the rule of law.<p>Slavery would probably be very profitable if allowed in America today. The productivity of labor is much higher than it used to be in the 19th century, and the cost of subsistence maintenance of a human being probably hasn't increased very much. However, our laws and cultural biases are effective at preventing it.<p>Slavery is a side-effect of poverty and the weakness of law. Do-gooders will not be able to end slavery until prosperity and the rule of law become common place.",1229761522

404409,comment,404009,404360,0,0,axod,,,"I think judging a language by ""Hello-world"" is a mistake.
Sure, some languages have a fixed overhead for creating a program. Some have needless syntax fluff that doesn't do all that much, but it's actually a good skill IMHO to be able to identify and see through that fluff to the core elements of the code.<p>When we pick up a book do we judge it based on the index at the back and the preface and the publishing info at the start? We probably just ignore those bits.<p>I think in these sorts of classes it'd actually be a good idea to spend several weeks looking at other peoples code and analyzing what it does. Being able to read code properly is a really important skill I think people should master before they even start with writing hello-world themselves.",1229761431

Wires and transistors. An 18 year old should learn the fundamentals and not the shortcuts. That's my opinion--maybe I'm wrong.

404404,comment,404356,404356,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I find the subject of slavery interesting so I upmodded this. But I found myself drifting off towards the end. (Traditionally, towards the end of an article, even the most supremely unqualified journalist is supposed to make recommendations to improving the world--unsurprisingly, these always fall short).<p>In fact, within human relations, there is an economic force that is beyond defiance: Cost/benefits. If the benefits of slavery exceed its costs, slavery will exist. Period.<p>Period.<p>There is no fighting it, if that dismal formula says otherwise. This is something I have said to people in real life: We will have slavery again the very instant the laws of economics require it. In Haiti it is already so. In Eastern Europe it has been off-and-on (mail-order brides). In America, we will see it yet....",1229760636

When Digg had a town hall meeting in Chicago, people were there to meet Kevin and have him sign their iPhones.  He's gotta be out there as much as possible.<p>I concede having no knowledge on any of these other fronts, but I don't understand how all the good PR that comes from Rose's ubiquity in tech media can be anything but crucial to Digg's success.",1229760572

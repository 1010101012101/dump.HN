People commute and don&#x27;t scratch their car everyday, but I think for the majority it&#x27;s more a combination of luck and tolerance of the system than pure skill and mastery of the art.<p>In this respect, I think most drivers are not OK having a  discussion with their passengers. They can, because they don&#x27;t devote 100% of their brain power to driving (it&#x27;s more of a chore than anything else, and no one wants to focus on chores), but personally I think they shouldn&#x27;t. Eventually we should find a driving system more centered about user safety, better designed and less taxing for the driver, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.<p>I guess it&#x27;s obvious now, but I think most people should live in urbanised areas with good public transports, and/or high tolerance to walking/biking/kick boarding. Walking my kid to school is a nice experience, like you describe it; Driving my kid would be stressing at best, I&#x27;d be more focused on the brake light of the car in front of me than the soccer match tonight.",1416409041

8630296,comment,8625433,8627526,0,0,joelgwebber,,,"My personal experience at a startup with a large amount of Go code running its frontend and backend servers. YMMV.<p>First off, I also find the interface-nil thing to be a frustrating edge-case. I also know that this design was the result of some difficult tradeoffs, as such things often are. We can argue about whether they made the <i>right</i> tradeoff, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to refer to it as a &quot;mindblowingly wrong idiocy&quot;.<p>Second, on error handling. Having now written a large amount of server code in Go, I find that I strongly support their approach, even when I find it a bit verbose. Here&#x27;s how I find it actually plays out in practice:<p><pre><code>    // You write something like this:
    result, err := getResults()
    if err != nil {
      return err
    }

    // Then you reuse err for the next call
    result, err := getResults()
    if err != nil {
      return err
    }

    stats, err := computeStats(result)
    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
</code></pre>
Eventually, you realize that `return err` just isn&#x27;t enough most of the time, because it&#x27;s impossible to make sense out of your logs. So we added a simple &quot;error chaining&quot; function that allows you to pass context when you return the error, which makes the logs much clearer than just a single error message, or raw stack trace. And of course it is often the case that you want to do more logging in your error blocks, even as you ignore the error and move on (e.g., &quot;spurious error reading memcache entry; falling back to the slow thing&quot;).<p>The practical reality of writing good server code is that exceptions which get caught way up the stack are inscrutable in your logs (at least that was our experience), so it makes sense to know up-front exactly where failures can happen, and to be forced to think about them the first time you write your code. Yes, it can be a bit verbose, but we&#x27;ve found the tradeoff to be net positive.",1416408706

I you have a lot of stuff that have limited build dependencies beyond Debian&#x27;s &quot;build-essential&quot; target, you might as well create a debian:wheezy image with &quot;build-essential&quot; installed and work from that to begin with.<p>The issue is that some types of apps, like any Ruby app that uses Bundler and has dependencies on stuff with native extensions, can drag in hundreds of MB of dependencies that are only needed during build, and the build is only necessary when adding dependencies. For those kinds of apps it just wastes time and bloats your images to do the builds in the same Dockerfiles that you deploy with. If you&#x27;re deploying 4-5 images now on a server or two, that&#x27;s no big deal. When you&#x27;re deploying 500 containers, you start getting picky about anything that slows down the process...<p>For those situations, I&#x27;d typically put together a Dockerfile with all the basic dependencies, and then &quot;inherit&quot; from that once for a dev/build container with the build dependencies, but without an entrypoint (so I can easily start it into bash or have it run a build script, or whatever I want), and then secondly for the final container where the latter image just  adds the build artefacts.<p>Ideally I&#x27;d want everything I deploy to just have the files that are needed. Pragmatically, the tools are not quite there yet. Not least, it&#x27;s often a real pain to build apps statically (if it&#x27;s even possible), and the known dependencies are too granular (e.g. dependency on a large package, with no documentation about precisely what in the package has to be present) and it will take a long time to build up a &quot;catalog&quot; of more minimal images and build processes.",1416408283

If you will have low sales numbers (ie: 10k or less/year) then look for having high value and high margins (few hundred dollar price and 50% gross margins).  If you will have high sales numbers (100k+ or 1M+ per year) then you can get down below the $100 price point and lower your margins somewhat (but I suggest staying above 25% gross margin).<p>Expect that your BOM (bill of materials) for the electronics parts, when priced at your yearly volume pricing, will be 1/3 of the cost of your product.

When I wrote Python most of my errors didn&#x27;t seem like type errors (e.g. I remember forgetting to close a connection and so leaking connections), but now that I write Scala I can see how I&#x27;d structure my program using types so that that would be a type error (I&#x27;d use monads to compose the idea of an operation that uses a connection, and then execute them in one place).<p>(Python now has an ad-hoc fix for this specific problem in the form of the &quot;with&quot; statement, just as 3.4 adds an ad-hoc fix for the proliferation of different ways of doing async calls. But a good type system is a general solution to both these problems and more).<p>> Dynamic type checking and implicit conversion is one of the more powerful features of JavaScript<p>In a strongly typed language you can do this in a controlled way; it can be part of the language, and can apply equally well to user-defined structures. Whereas with Javascript you&#x27;re stuck with those implicit conversions built into the language, and if you want to convert e.g. an address datatype, you&#x27;re out of luck.<p>> certainly no less prone to error or counter-productive than type-casting, making variadic functions or class templates are in other languages.<p>Then use a language that doesn&#x27;t have those problems either.

Efficient, minimal code - often because of simple design - was encouraged more than it is today.<p>Now, thanks to all these libraries, frameworks, languages, etc., someone can in a single line of code summon dozens or more layers of abstraction - and be quite unaware of the actual amount of resources being used - until something breaks or feels too slow or runs out of memory.

Even before you look at the test content you&#x27;d want to compare across demographic profiles (i.e. parental education levels or income) to see whether that trend holds up. In the case of the PISA scores, there&#x27;s 2013 paper claiming that some percentage of the differences are explained by a sampling bias over-representing low-income students: <a href=""http://www.epi.org/publication/us-student-performance-testing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epi.org/publication/us-student-performance-testin...</a> That could have an effect on the top-end scores as well if it reduced the percentage of top students in the pool.<p>The other big problem you get is that this is a very narrow test of a single subject and Goodhart&#x27;s law reigns supreme in this kind of comparison. The total difference being discussed is a 2% delta between the top US decile and Shanghai, which was the world leader. Even if that&#x27;s not just random fluctuation, it could be explained entirely by something as simple as Singapore making that test a priority whereas it&#x27;s largely off the radar in the US. That&#x27;s not an accusation of cheating – it could be as simple as whether kids have drilled as heavily on a specific skill which is used more in one national curriculum than the other.<p>EDIT: To clarify: this shouldn&#x27;t be read as criticism of PISA – I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve made considerable effort to address this challenges – but simply that this kind of comparison is a <i>HARD</i> challenge.",1416405673

Overlapping instructions, for example, is one optimisation that I don&#x27;t think compilers will be able to do any time soon.

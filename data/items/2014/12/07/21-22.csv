If a Cellphone can have an accelerometer, reasonably accurate GPS and a baseband transceiver, why can&#x27;t a UAV?<p>All my research so far indicates the main issue is getting a GPS module that is certified accurate to use in a ADS-B transponder at low cost. For approx. $2,000 they are commercially available and within the SWaP(Size, Weight and Power) requirements for a DJI Phantom or similar. What the FAA would say about fitting a DJI Phantom with a transponder would be interesting.<p>What would be intelligent would be fitting a ADS-B receiver to the UAV, and if an aircraft is detected within caution range (say  0.5 miles) the UAV pilot is alerted.<p>What would be <i>more</i> intelligent is increased awareness about flying anything (Quadcopter, other UAV or even a kite) within range of an airport.

The digital media space is vast, and while Google has a large market share, they are not the only players, so I&#x27;d love to know how you can attribute both of these examples (which sound like you were not present to observe and have info from less savvy second parties) to Google.<p>Publishers absolutely have done shady things to drive ad revenue.

No lisp developer I&#x27;ve ever worked with is unaware of what a cache line is, nor the importance of it for optimzation.<p>Optimizing a lisp program is very similar to optimizing a C program: a profiler will be used, and the disassembly will be inspected.  The main difference is that the pattern of allocations matters a bit more, as there is a garbage collector consuming CPU time along with the mutator (Note that in some cases heap allocation can be just as cheap as stack allocation, as a generational garbage collector that uses Cheney&#x27;s Algorithm for the nursery will collect short lived objects at essentially no cost).",1417989190

The latter is what you (implicitly) get when you write an algorithm recursively.<p>A much more interesting observation would have been to note that you could accomplish the same thing by introducing a new language construct that explicitly noted that the order of two calls doesn&#x27;t matter.  That would allow a compiler to automatically produce code that used a set-of-intervals data structure, or -- much more relevant in today&#x27;s world -- code that used multiple cores.

It dismisses the explanation that investigation and shutdown of radicalizing social media and disruptive ideas is done A.) both by Western and non-Western states and B.) that Western states radicalize social media and news media to achieve policy and geopolitical goals for the crude and inequitable implication that instead these states are just &#x27;evil&#x27;. It just isn&#x27;t that way.<p>When Twitter is being used by competing nations as a means to incite riots in your people, what would you do if you were in power?<p>Looking to America&#x27;s present: Fusion Centers track various political groups including the Tea Party, Occupy was dismantled by federal agent intervention, access to stories, interviews and meetings is given to journalists and news corporations that &#x27;play ball&#x27; with the government and several extremely important political stories have been repressed (Risen&#x27;s first NSA surveillance story circa second Bush election) or pushed (including false stories, such as the Fallujah Psyop and the partnership with journalist Judith Miller to falsely justify the invasion of Iraq). But we don&#x27;t even need to look at that. We can look at the link included in the very first post - the US government wants to be able to study radicalizing Twitter messages targeting Americans.<p>Looking to America&#x27;s past you&#x27;ll see that both Red Scares burgeoned the state with extra-Constitutional capabilities to restrict American speech, as it was believed that dangerous ideas coming from the last domino of revolutions in Europe (the Soviet Union) where more extreme versions of populist ideas (the Bolsheviks) threatened the system and the status quo so fully it could foment in the end of the US government (as it had already done repeatedly in Europe). Take the Mayor of Jersey City Frank Hague during the Red Scare: &quot;We hear about constitutional rights, free speech and the free press. Every time I hear these words I say to myself, &#x27;That man is a Red, that man is a Communist.&#x27; You never hear a real American talk like that.&quot;<p>That is to say America does do and has done <i>the same sort of restrictions of free speech</i> this article, and others in this thread, would import into a sense of &#x27;evil&#x27;.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s been a global crack down on the internet. A global one. In Western states, there has been too. It&#x27;s just inequitable to attribute the crack down in non-Western states to &#x27;evilness&#x27; and the crack down in Western states to &#x27;practicality&#x27;. And to ignore the pressures and leverages on non-Western states placed on them by America/allies. That&#x27;s what this part of the thread of the discussion is about.<p>As far as the discussion specifically of Western governments and their use of realpolitik, I think it was mostly spurred by the comment suggesting it might be justified by Western &#x27;spreading of freedom&#x27; (the thread then focused on analyzing this, and correctly identified IMHO that Western states don&#x27;t have that track record of spreading freedom attributed to them in myth).",1417988050

Embedding Handlebars expressions inside Haml diminishes the power and simplicity of the language, in my opinion.<p>If a developer could avoid double curly braces, and use if, each, etc. with indentation removing the need for opening and closing expressions, the syntax would be closer to the aesthetics of Haml.

I come from an eastern-block immigrant background where capitalism and individualism, ideas that allowed the west to rapidly develop and innovate, were actively suppressed. My parents were a successful part of the intelligentsia in their home country, and despite putting in the hours and working hard, but after successive setbacks, this success didn&#x27;t translate that well in the west.<p>I consider both of them wealthy in many areas but at the same time poor by western standards. While I&#x27;d rate them highly on individualism, I wouldn&#x27;t rate them on their ability to capitalise on opportunities. I know many people who made it out of the old eastern block who have been amazingly successful by western standards, and it&#x27;s puzzled me to no end, why intelligent people such as my parents never made it.<p>Many possibilities come to mind:<p>- Making it out alive was in itself a mark of success for them<p>- Their way of thinking did not adapt to the west&#x27;s and they \ngot stuck in a &quot;poor&quot; state of mind<p>- Bad luck<p>In any case, I can attest, that changing this way of thinking is not an easy task.",1417986302

On Ivy Bridge, SSE is enough to saturate memory bus.</i><p>I&#x27;d claim instead that it&#x27;s surprisingly hard to saturate the memory bus with a single core[1].  Presuming your math is right, you&#x27;ve given the rate at which Haswell can load from L1 to registers if we can ignore latency and concurrency.  That is, the CPU can sustain this number only if the latency is low enough relative to the number of &quot;requests in flight&quot;.  In practice, these prevent a single core from saturating the memory bus except for the case of dual-channel memory, perfect prediction and prefetching, and no TLB misses.<p>More commonly, the latency of the read from memory combined with the limited number (10) of &quot;line fill buffers&quot; reduces the throughput from RAM.  The formula for actual bandwidth is known as &quot;Little&#x27;s Law&quot;: Concurrency = Latency * Bandwidth.  Considering it&#x27;s fundamental importance in gauging actual performance, it&#x27;s strikingly rare to see it discussed in CS theory.  John McCalpin, the author of the Stream benchmark has an excellent explanation of how it applies to memory bandwidth: <a href=""http://sites.utexas.edu/jdm4372/2010/11/03/optimizing-amd-opteron-memory-bandwidth-part-1-single-thread-read-only/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sites.utexas.edu/jdm4372/2010/11/03/optimizing-amd-op...</a><p>[1] Here&#x27;s my write up of trying to do so on Sandy Bridge: <a href=""https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/480004"" rel=""nofollow"">https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/480004</a>",1417986189

3121895,comment,3121533,3121766,3,0,zerotype,,,"I don't think calling something a ripoff is unfair. Yeah, they didn't invent those devices, but when they come out with their version of it which happens to be the first successful one. Then, after that device comes out every other company decides to be inspired by that it kind of is a ripoff. I'll admit that ripoff is perhaps a bit too strong of language but the sentiment is the same.<p>You can argue that eventually mp3 players would have succeeded, that smart phones would eventually all be flat touch screens, and that tablets would be cheap, not run a desktop os and successful. Truth is, we don't know because apple made those products a success first. To me actually making a product well, easy/fun/enjoyable to use is innovative. I really don't believe that we would see as many android tablets (well, tablets in general) if it were no for the ipad. I also still think the ipad is the best tablet because of the UI/apps and things mentioned in this article.  The ipad also manages to be a pretty great price.",1318877995

3121892,comment,3121533,3121533,25,0,unoti,,,"I develop apps for both iPhone and Android.  I stopped  carrying my iPhone for personal use, and use my Droid Bionic full time.  Here are the 3 reasons why.<p>1. Google Maps, and navigation.  If you're actually driving places, google maps is an amazing godsend.  If you're taking mass transit, it blows the doors off what's on the iPhone.  Ever get on a bus with your iphone, and have it vibrate\nin your pants when the next bus stop is the one you need to take? Google navigate shows you your mass transit trip in a schematic view that shows you where all the stops are in list form, and animates the little bullet point in the list as you move between stops.  It's breathtaking.  It'll be hard\nto beat Google Maps on an iphone, and I missed this sorely.  For me the maps\nare so superior that during the brief time that I used iPhone, I used it as a\nwireless hotspot and kept my old android phone around just for the maps\nand navigation.  I'm new to my city (San Francisco) and my whole experience\nof moving here was greatly enriched by the awesomeness of Google Maps.\nMany people probably already know where they're going or are already\nfamiliar with their mass transit options, so using a second class citizen for\nnavigation (such as the iPhone) is probably fine for them.<p>2. Google Mail.  Google's gmail app UI is awesome.  I didn't know how much I\nloved it until I had to use iOS for a while.    Bundling things by conversation\nis great.  And I often receive 20-30 emails that are all divided into a total of\nabout 3 conversations.  Google lets me read and archive or delete those\nin 4 clicks (3 checkboxes for the 3 conversations, then one click of Archive\nor Delete).  The iOS mail app makes me do that in around 60-80 clicks:\neither a swipe on the index page followed by a delete, or else a click on each\nemail, followed by a delete.<p>3. Notification bar.  I can always look at the top bar of my droid and know\nwhat, if anything, needs my attention.  Or at the very least, why my phone\nmade a noise in the last few minutes.   It was hard for me to see at a glance what things just caused\nmy phone to beep.  If I received a meeting reminder, and a text, and something else,\nit was always clear on my droid which things need my attention, because of the status bar.\nThere wasn't something like this on the iPhone.  A few days ago they implemented a\nstatus bar on the iPhone, but it still feels like a cheap immitation of what Android does,\nin much the same way that the author here talks about how Android is a cheap clone of iOS.<p>But to be clear, the ""feel"" of the iPhone is superior in pretty much every way. But to me, it's not <i>all</i> about feel.",1318877962
3121891,story,,,4,1,softwaregravy,"Can I get faster off of Heroku?",,"The question is: will I be see a speed bump by moving off of Heroku?<p>We're using Heroku.  It's great.  I love it.  We spend a few thousand a month on it, between instances and databases, and generally couldn't be happier.  However, we're scoping a new project that would require us to hit pretty aggressive latency targets -- sub 100ms.<p>Currently, we're a Rails 3 app processing between 80-90% of our requests sub 100ms, as measured by new-relic.  Given that we have to hit the latency target from the client's perspective, I'm going to fudge another 10% hit to that success rate (thus down to about 3/4 of requests).<p>Yes, there are occasional network blips on Heroku that can cause latency, but we're fine tying our success to Heroku's at least in the short term.<p>If we want to hit the 100ms latency target for 95% of requests, I see 3 options:\na) Optimize on our current rails stack in Heroku\nb) Move to straight AWS, or other hosting provider\nc) Rebuild functionality into something I feel more confident could hit the latency target.  Probably Java.<p>a is obviously the prime candiate, but I've already picked off the low-hanging fruit.  c is probably most certainly the most likely to succeed, but also take the most work (most of the engineers today came from Java, so we don't have any Ruby->Java penalty).  But b is kind of a dark horse, where it could be good or it could be worse -- I don't know how to tell without trying it out and load testing, but then, that's basically just doing it and seeing if it was successful.<p>I'm trying to decide between them, or find a way to decide between them.

I learned this the hard way myself, I tried approaching the iOS like it was an andriod and was similarly disappointed and frustrated.  Many ""why the fuck doesn't this thing X?"" were yelled.

3121887,comment,3120050,3121147,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>Error rates are hugely important yet completely ignored in court.</i><p>Not actually true. This is not to say that courts get it right all the time, but it's not particularly newsworthy when they do. Attacking the chain of custody and alleging contamination or false positives are standard techniques in challenging forensic testimony, both biological and digital.<p>The cases where the forensic evidence is legitimately challenged and those challenges are ignored or overruled are often dramatic and newsworthy, but the rate of miscarriages of justice is falling because courts today are much more aware of these issues than the courts of (say) 20 years ago. Unfortunately news reporting of trials and appeals is so utterly awful that people tend to assume the exceptional is the norm.<p>I'm not saying that it isn't a problem, just that the courts are more cognizant of the issue than more people appreciate.",1318877927
3121885,comment,3119518,3121723,3,0,CWuestefeld,,,"It's true that the gap between rich and poor is greater today than in recent history. But I don't think that it's entirely correct to say that wealth has been redistributed to the wealthy. In fact, to a significant extent, people have <i>redistributed themselves</i> away from the wealth.<p>These wealth numbers are presented as household income. But this increasing disparity closely tracks the rise since the 70s of single-parent households. Divorce, and more recently the trend to have children without being married at all (in certain demographics, this is now the norm), mean that people are deciding on their own to arrange themselves into units having less earning power.<p>Even when single-parent households aren't the explanation, the idea of ""sortative mating"" amplifies differences in income. People tend pair off with similar people. Thus, well-educated people (who tend to have higher income potential) marry each other; uneducated people also tend to marry. So if two people, each with income potential of 2X, marry; while two others, each with income potential of 1X, also marry, then the resulting differential across households is 2X. The sortative effect has, in this example, doubled the apparent difference between people.<p>Neither of these effects can be attributed to corporate behavior in any way.<p>Obviously, some of the difference simply reflects the difference in productivity between different people. We tend to dislike thinking of things in these terms, but people doing certain kinds of jobs are far more productive than people in other jobs. In particular, the skills we've learned in wielding technology, or medicine, etc., benefit people to a much greater degree than, say, an individual McDonald's worker or miner or the like. And the fact that one is producing more leads to being able to demand greater income.<p>We also err in considering people (or households) as being high-income or low-income, as if this were a static condition. In fact, at least in America, there is pretty good opportunity for income mobility. I don't have stats at my fingertips, but a really large portion of those in the top quintile have spent time near the bottom. It's a mistake to believe that someone is just ""a rich person"" or just ""a poor person"", since there's significant migration between those groups (at least relative to much of the rest of the world).<p>You'll note that the rise in income inequality seems correlated with the rise in the power of the federal government (as opposed to the state and local authorities). I assume you've heard Lord Acton's Dictum: ""Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely."" Well, he said another interesting thing. He said (sorry that I don't have the actual text here) that democracy tends to concentrate power into the hands of an elite few, and that the only known solution is a strong federalist system, in which the central government is kept weak by power residing in the hands of the states. Thus, it seems that the rise of a strong central government that we've seen over the past, say, 3/4 century, may be related to the rise of a privileged oligopoly. If so, it's clear that looking for a solution by giving that central government additional power is the opposite of the best answer.",1318877915

Some women may feel pressured to raise their arms in the air, and act enthusiastic. It's not a repeal of the Nineteenth Amendment. It's not even 30 seconds of prime time TV. And Randall has done a lot of notionally feminist cartoons. I'm sure a hardline feminist can pick holes in his work, but I still think he's going to shift <i>most</i> of his readers towards a more feminist viewpoint; especially the sad cases who think that women can't do math.<p>Feminists seem to think that because sexism has caused a lot of bad things (women barred from universities, few female CEOs, etc); anything that can be accused of being remotely sexist is an objectively bad thing.

How weird would it be if there was no cultural preference? If the preference was always 50.0/50.0? Now <i>that</i> would be unlikely!<p>There are so many factors here, some of which are, no doubt, cultural stereotypes about gender.

That's a stretch for an explanation of why men and women find the women's voice more likeable. Why not the much more likely Loving Mother stereotype?

Google, or anybody else, would not have much choices when comes to build a new one. Window, apps, app store, etc. are fundamental to a mobile OS. Maybe Apple made the first one to be massively adopted and recognized, but they are not really inovators, they always  took something that alreay existed (excepted first computer) and made it a more appealing product for the mass market. Take iPod, iPhone and the iPad for instance. Mp3 player existed before the iPod. They took the concept, built an appealing product from it and sold it to the mass market. Same thing for the iPhone, took the concept of a mobile phone, put it in their iPod OS. Again, same thing for the iPad. Tablets were there. They were unpopular due to a lot of reasons. Apple took the concept, improved it and sold a better product.<p>Give them credit for make awesome product out of existing ones, but quit saying they invented everything and everything else is a rip off.",1318876306

Here's a post (of mine) that's a little longer on details.<p><a href=""http://blog.ministryofcoding.com/2011/06/29/always-be-shipping-real-world-continuous-deployment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ministryofcoding.com/2011/06/29/always-be-shippi...</a><p>I boil it down to this: The safest change to deploy to a stable system is the smallest change possible. Most of my changes don't require schema changes at all.<p>The application itself, on startup, verifies that the database has the tables/columns it needs in order to work. If it doesn't, it will CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE appropriately.<p>I try to avoid backwards-incompatible schema changes whenever possible, so I can rollback. It's always safer and easier to add a new table or column than to delete/rename an existing one. Something wrong with the code? Rolling back won't send you back to an incompatible state.<p>I use an ORM instead of stored procedures, because I find them a lot more friendly with this general process, you don't have procs that expect a particular parameter signature.<p>You may need to decouple your db-changes deployments from your non-db-changes deployments. Doing that can at least make the non-db-changes deployments a lot less painful.",1318874782

Clickable was an early Facebook Ads partner, allowing its users to manage their Facebook ads through Clickable since March, 2010. Clickable lets marketers upload social ads in bulk, track conversions, and compare to their marketing campaigns elsewhere, including search marketing campaigns. We look at it as one platform across all the networks, says Kidder. Twitter and LinkedIn will be next.<p>Generally my issue with what they say is that Clickable does not really have a very unique selling proposition, when compared to products like Kenshoo or DART. I'm not here to diss them, just point out my experience.<p>For paid search, Kenshoo has an unbelievably good algorithm that really does drastically improve ROI in a fairly short period of time. The interface isn't as intuitive at first, but you get used to it really quick and you spend far less time managing a campaign but can squeeze every last penny of profit out of it very fast.<p>BrighterOption has my favorite FB ads manager out there (currently using them for my FB campaigns) and has a much better interface than Clickable. On Fb the priority is quickly duplicating campaigns, targeting sets, creative and geo-targeting. BrighterOption lets you work very quickly when optimizing your campaigns and it has turned my EPH (earnings per hour) on FB from about $131.89 (last year) to $464.62 (this year).<p>Clickable is extremely good at marketing their product, but in general if you're looking for a tool like it, I would say to look elsewhere. Managing PPC is all about data, metrics and optimizing your ROIT (return-on-invested-time).",1318874632

Sometimes finding and taking care of that last 0.1% risk of failure just isn't worth it. Sometimes you're better off babysitting the deployment for 30 minutes once or twice a month rather than spending valuable development hours updating your deployment scripts to be fully automatic and handle every possible contingency.",1318874537

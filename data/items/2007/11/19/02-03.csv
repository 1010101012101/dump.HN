81386,comment,81347,81363,0,0,Goladus,,,"There are a couple of problems with this advice, in my experience.<p>First, is that when I take that approach I invariably wind up with two dozen half-started projects and do very little to build up long-term skills.  There are so many things that I love, if I stopped every time I hit a dip to try something else, I'd never finish anything.  Plus, one of the things I love is the sense of satisfaction of completing something and doing it well-- especially if I have made a commitment to someone.  If rewards are too far off to affect me emotionally, and only my rational brain knows they will be worth it in the end, then I need other way to help stay focused.<p>The second issue is that there are good things in life that you can't do 'in the zone.' Meeting new people, for example, doesn't require the meditative attention that hacking does.  So finding yourself outside the zone for significant periods of time is rather common and not a bad thing.  One needs some way to keep that from derailing productivity, however.",1195439123
81385,comment,81347,81375,0,0,brooksbp,,,"True. But you should have more motivation to keep at it and work around complicated problems.  There was no mention of running away every time a project gets challenging.  Just pointing out that if you truely love what you do, nothing can hold you back.  If you truely love and have a passion for what you do, you should want complicated, nasty problems.  You should have courage and confidence in facing these problems...<p>Yes, dangerous advice.  But it's the truth.",1195439079

You know all the people you give the source code to, so you know who to go to about leaks.  And most clients won't care about the source code anyway.  What's most important is that you be clear about the terms under which your code is released.<p>Probably should consult a copyright lawyer.",1195437816

Rapid testing of ideas is more important than squeezing out that last 1% of performance improvement.  Iterative refinement is research death.)",1195437662

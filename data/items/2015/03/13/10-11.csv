9196505,comment,9191849,9191849,0,0,michael_miller,,,"IMHO, the commercial vs. private distinction doesn&#x27;t make sense when applied to drones. For airplanes, the logic is that paying passengers expect a certain level of safety which cannot be provided by someone with 40 hours of flight time. In essence, the FAA is shielding paying customers from the risks of low-time pilots. For drones, this logic doesn&#x27;t follow. A private operation inherently has the same risks as a commercial operation. There&#x27;s no passengers to kill - only people on the ground to hurt. The people are there regardless of whether you&#x27;re flying for hire or not, and have no say on your flight.<p>I do think drones pose a significant risk to the NAS (National Airspace System) unless regulated correctly. To me this doesn&#x27;t mean that we need to start fining people who post YouTube videos. I believe a pragmatic approach is best - people are going to be dumb and use drones for illegal / dangerous things. The best action the FAA can take to mitigate this is to require manufacturers to include an ADS-B transponder to broadcast the drone&#x27;s GPS position at all times. At least then, pilots can safely avoid reckless drone pilots.",1426244358

9196491,comment,9195303,9196431,0,0,adventured,,,"It doesn&#x27;t matter if the stock is undervalued (which is a strictly subjective premise anyway - undervalued by what measure?). If it&#x27;s overvalued that just reduces the value proposition of the buyback. The value proposition is always positive no matter what price is paid (that however says nothing about the specific value proposition, merely that it&#x27;s a positive number).<p>I&#x27;d argue that GM is closer to undervalued than anything else. It&#x27;s capable of yielding at least $6 billion in net income over the next four quarters, giving it in the neighborhood of a 10 multiple. The economy looks to remain strong&#x27;ish over 12 months, the consumer is spending and able to borrow at low rates, which will continue to float GM&#x27;s sales.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting it&#x27;s not enough to only take the over / under valuation of the stock into account when doing a buyback. You have to account for use of cash - that is, what&#x27;s the best use of your cash holdings. If there are no great alternatives - for any number of reasons - there is nothing wrong with doing stock buybacks when the stock price is richly valued (especially if the cash held is producing mediocre returns, as cash does today). Buying the stock back may be a vastly superior choice to sitting on the cash when it comes to producing returns for shareholders.<p>Chipotle is famous for doing this despite their very hefty valuation and relatively rapid expansion. Has turned out very well for shareholders.",1426243994

9196483,comment,9190955,9190955,0,0,sbt,,,"It seems the core of this argument comes down to the diversity/complexity of today&#x27;s software environment. That&#x27;s understandable, but there are clear reasons why it is this way, and equally apparent upsides. Without elaborating too much on it, few people build software like they did in the 80s anymore, most software glues together libraries others have written. This leads to more complicated build processes.<p>While this is true, I think on balance the author&#x27;s case is unjustified. First of all, it&#x27;s not like you could just type &#x27;make&#x27; to build something back in the day either, unless you were compiling a simple library that was only supported on one platform. Secondly, sysadmins should not be in the business of building source code from scratch. What is the security upside of that, are sysadmins expected to audit the code?<p>I believe containerization is an incredibly exciting technology to have hit ops, and old school sysadmins should emerge from their nostalgic depression and embrace it, and adapt to change. I have been using everything from CFEngine, to Puppet, to Ansible over the past decade. Containers are an amazing breakthrough, because they standardize the build process. We have our own container repository that essentially act as a private package repository. The contract of what the container is allowed to do to the outside world and host environment is clear. As a result, the hosts are spartan, simple and secure. This is miles from the old world of large servers where dozens of services shared the same file system.<p>I am so happy that we finally live in the age of containerization. I would never wish to go back to that old world the author describes.",1426243891

All of the games you listed have very good stories, but those stories make you the Center of the Universe and everything revolves around you. Even the parts of the setting that are explained give a very strong feeling that, at the end of the day, they were developed to justify and validate your goals and missions, either by hampering you or aiding you.<p>In direct contrast, I&#x27;d like to point to the Baldur&#x27;s Gate games. They don&#x27;t just have an excellent narrative. They also take place in a very strong, well-established setting. This setting successfully conveys the feeling that, while you are an important character and what you&#x27;re trying to do is important, at the end of the day the world (of Faerun) is chock full of people and organizations and nations with their own agendas. The epic saga you experience is simply one strand in a massive tapestry. And in the end you don&#x27;t save the world or some such nonsense. You simply conclude your own story, and life goes on.<p>Compare this to Mass Effect, where you literally save the entire galaxy from ultra-powerful robots who literally want to wipe out all life.

I.e. it is like an autoencoder, but the inner-most reduced representation is forced to be related to a graphics rendering engine by manipulating related transformation parameters.<p>Not only is this interesting from the point of view of using it for learning how to generate images, but it is a novel way to force a semantic internal representation instead of leaving it up to a regularisation strategy and interpreting the sparse encoding post-hoc.

Going out and buying an iPhone is an expensive experience, and likely out of reach for the very poor (I don&#x27;t have one, I think it&#x27;s too expensive for what it is), yet given how many I see wandering around here in the UK I am always impressed that the insanely wealthy and the not-so-wealthy get to use the same device. It&#x27;s kind of reassuring that we all get access to the same software and hardware, even if we use basic Android smartphones instead.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like the wide access to low-cost flights to Europe; that would have been unthinkable in the 1980s.<p>I always find it oddly refreshing to see! We haven&#x27;t made the same progress in politeness and kindness to our fellow man, but at least technology is relatively cheap and easily available.",1426241739

They obtained the IP addresses\nfrom ads they allegedly published themselves. This was major news in Germany.<p>The reason it doesn&#x27;t happen more often is that going against Torrent users\nis much easier and less risky for the law firm. Urmann + Collegen went bankrupt in 2014 from the fall out of this case, but this is the exception.<p>I don&#x27;t have a number for 2013,\nbut in 2011 the mentioned law firm alone sent 70000 cease and desist letters amounting 90 million Euro.<p><pre><code>    What k___ is saying is that it&#x27;s the illegal upload part that moves \n    people away from torrent.\n</code></pre>\nI understood, but that&#x27;s not relevant for Germany. \nEven if it was true it wouldn&#x27;t matter, because the two points I mentioned\ngive the cease and desist lawyers (Abmahnanwälte) a much easier way to go\nagainst downloaders.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rechtsanwaltskanzlei-urheberrecht.de/news/Abmahnung_Download_Uplo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rechtsanwaltskanzlei-urheberrecht.de/news/Abmahnu...</a>",1426241440

A meteor can hit your house. You can get into a car accident. None of these are comparable in risk to free soloing.<p>Skydiving as a sport has 3 million jumps per year and ~21 deaths. It&#x27;s extremely safe in comparison. (only about 1/5 of mountaineering injuries end in death)<p>There are many ways to get extreme thrills in life or achieve a zen state and not all of them have comparable risks of dying. And many of them have a non-zero probability of injury instead of death due to safety factors from equipment.<p>And then there are risks that bring societal benefit, for example, those who serve in dangerous places around the world bringing humanitarian assistance, or documenting human rights abuses. These are measured risks, and they are not solely selfish. Astronauts and explorers take risks on their missions, but they do so with the best equipment and preparation they can, and often for reasons that go beyond sport.<p>Deliberating putting yourself into a situation by forging the usual safety equipment is being reckless.<p>Often, the usual response to this kind of reasoning is that you could die at anytime so why not &quot;live life to its fullest&quot; but that&#x27;s kind of a hedonistic copout. Subjectively you could define this to mean anything, like overdosing on heroin and dying in bliss. I think if you&#x27;re going to be reasonable and empathic to your loved ones, your family, your community, you should have more concerns than just getting off on your own extreme hobbies while raising the cortisol levels of everyone who loves you.

676791,comment,676785,676785,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Speaking personally (and I know a few people have said the same in the past) I upvote comments that are constructive or that make a good argument and downvote trollish, rude or ""lol"" style comments.<p>Irrespective of if I agree with their message or not.<p>Examples. Take these to comments <i>I</i> made the other day:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=675136"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=675136</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=675230"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=675230</a><p>The first was rightfully downvoted because it all but amounted to a rant. In the second I made a much more reasoned point (but with basically the same conclusion as the first) and it got an upvote.<p>In my eyes that is the HN effect working :)<p>Although all of that said I have noticed a tendency for upvotes to snowball sometimes - and for some comments to obviously be voted on based on agreement/disagreement *(not that there is a specific rule against that of course!).",1246102281

Thus, with 12 phalanges to choose from on one hand and 5 digits to choose from on the other, we have 12 * 5 = 60 combinations.",1246102143

676786,comment,676056,676771,0,0,hachiya,,,"Glycemic index is not the only determining factor of a food's worth, nor has it been shown to necessarily carry much weight at all.<p>Glycemic <i>load</i> has been considered by some to be more important.<p>Chocolate cake has been measured to have a glycemic index of 38, while a baked potato is 85.  Heck, fructose, pure sugar, has a glycemic index of 19, while brown rice is at 87.<p>( Numbers from ""International table of glycemic index and glycemic load values: 2002"" Am J Clin Nutr. 2002 Jul;76(1):5-56.)<p>I don't think anyone is going to say chocolate cake or pure fructose is healthier than a baked potato or brown rice.<p>So there is certainly more to a food's nutritional value than the glycemic index, which has been shown to be on shaky ground.<p><a href=""http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2006nl/july/glycemic.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2006nl/july/glycemic.htm</a>\n ( Glycemic Index - Not Ready for Prime Time )<p>> Having normal potatoes as a staple will reduce your lifespan.<p>Reference please?  The assertion that potatoes will reduce one's lifespan is utter nonsense.  Reduce it compared to what?  An Atkins diet?  How well did that work out for Dr. Atkins?<p>Peruvians have traditionally used potatoes as a staple, and even in modern times they have 1/4 the heart disease death rate of the USA.  As heart disease is the leading cause of death, this is significant.  In fact, this ""potato capital of the world"" has obesity and diabetes rates which pale in comparison to the USA.<p>As we have such an abundant variety available to us today, it is possible to pick our own staples, and I personally prefer fruits or sweet potatoes to regular potatoes.  However, the fact remains that even regular potatoes are a healthy choice, provided they are consumed unrefined.  French fries are a disaster of a food, but nobody is advocating these highly processed potatoes as a staple food.<p>The below articles clearly demonstrate that potatoes are healthy and will not ""reduce your lifespan"".

676785,story,,,7,12,Ardit20,"Ask HN: Why should we upvote or downvote a comment?",,"With submission I suppose you up vote them because you like them? I do not understand how can you not up vote a comment you agree with though, or down vote one you disagree with.<p>Say someone comments about the liberal arts education being a good thing and old people are just deluding themselves in thinking that their education was much better and that our education is obsolete.<p>This comment I would up vote because I agree with it. If someone said Education is a complete failure I would down vote it because I disagree with it.<p>Apparently this is infuriating to some? Does that mean that we should not up vote comments we agree with?<p>In short, why do you think a comment should be up voted or down voted?",1246101562
676784,comment,676585,676585,0,0,tdavis,,,"Another way to be ""even happier"" is to learn these and other cues so that you can notice them when other people do them. Most of this stuff is involuntary, especially things like head tilting.<p>Also, if this stuff interests you, learn about split-second involuntary physical responses. Everybody does them and nobody controls them. Noticing these has gotten me out of trouble more than a few times.",1246101445

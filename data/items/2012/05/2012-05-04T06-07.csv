Why is it so easy to leave? Because youngster do not like their past, they do not like to see themselves as kids. It took a very long time for me to be able to look at a picture of my younger self without instinctive rejection. Only when you are on the ""other side"" of life that you value past pictures of your life.<p>Why was Instagram so successful? Some other may hvae said it but still, what strikes me the most is why so many people did use Instagram app to share pics instead of Facebook app. It can't be solely based on UI diffs. It is more because Facebook is perceived as an archive where everything goes if anyone is interested, a trashcan if you will.<p>I'll not bet a cent on FB.

Or at least the chips they manufacture do. I'm not familiar with the internals of the prefetcher of any CPU at this level, but let me wave hands here. This is what the prefetcher could do:<p>All it takes is for the prefetcher to get a cache line when requested, and then observe what is inside and look at pointer-sized and aligned values that look like pointers and are pretty close to the original cache line's (virtual) address. Now if these values happen to be sane virtual addresses in the current process, the prefetcher might as well fetch them one cache closer to the CPU. If it hits, it might yield big performance boost in real world apps. If it misses, it's just a little wasted electricity.<p>All modern CPUs do dirty little tricks like this if it helps them outshine their competitors.<p>Btw. you can add prefetch instructions in your code manually if you do linked list traversals or similar.

However, the company tanked (this was at a finance company, summer of '08), and my team was pretty much disbanded, so I went looking for a new job. Luckily, one of my team members had just gone back to his old job where he was a manager, so he was able to vouch for my awesomeness and hire me (despite extreme reluctance -- I'd gotten told multiple times by both recruiters and other engineering folks that they wouldn't be able to hire me full-time).<p>Unfortunately, the company turned out to be a terrible place to work, so I quit after a couple months. And from then on out, I had a really difficult time getting a job. People would say they had a company policy saying they couldn't hire drop outs, but they'd love me as an intern, or they'd tell me point-blank that I had great technical skills, but they were worried about my ability to ""commit"".<p>After all, I was a fresh young kid with very few connections, so it'd always be some clueless recruiter deciding whether to pass on my resume or not.

3927322,comment,3920683,3926694,2,0,Darmani,,,"The reason for using semicolons in JS is quite simple: It makes it easy to determine the boundaries between statements, both for humans and machines.<p>With semicolons, the search for the boundary between statements reduces to the search for that single character -- that means fast code skimming.<p>The boundary is also robust against changes; as long as that semicolon stays in place, nothing that happens within that statement can cause that boundary to become an interior.<p>There is an exception: Strings. This is no trouble for machines, as strings are processed by the lexer. Humans can't instantly take a string and process it as a chunk, but  a UI innovation does this work for us: syntax highlighting.<p>As an example, consider the code:<p><pre><code>  x = a && b
  foo()
</code></pre>
If I try to change the ""b"", I might accidentally turn the code into<p><pre><code>  x=a &&
  foo()
</code></pre>
The grammar allows the malformed statement to interact with its neighbor, and thus, instead of getting a parser error, I'll get a program bug.<p>LR parsers take advantage of this for error recovery, allowing them to find more than one parse error at a time.<p>A more sophisticated view is to think about syntax abstractions. Given a program like ""x=y; return x;"" we can create a program written in the abstract syntax ""statement; statement"". (The dual operation is to concretized that back into the set of all two-statement programs. This kind of relationship is known a Galois connection.) Having semicolons makes the abstract syntax unambiguous, allowing us to efficiently reason at the statement level.",1336112700

It seems like this gives you a different language syntax to access the same libraries with no additional abstraction. It doesn't seem like it would speed up development much.",1336111336

My nephew and his roommates managed to download 750gig of movies in 3weeks on their comcast internet.<p>With the average movie size being around 750meg that's 1000 movies. (not that I would actually know the size of a ripped movie ;-)  So on gigabit they'll be able to get more faster but if we're already at 1000 movies in 3 weeks what does it matter? That's more than 2x than you can actually watch on those 3 weeks if you could even manage to watch 24/7",1336111332

but you have to deal with the different sets of bugs in all
the GPU drivers. All (?) the OpenGL ES drivers are pretty buggy, so dealing with several at once is not pretty.",1336111328

I have no idea what Alsup's track record is with that.<p>> As for being 23 years, it doesn't matter, a US Supreme court decision from the 1800's is precedent.<p>Certainly. As I wrote it, that was the introduction to suggesting that there has been plenty of time for applicable cases, even if none are a smoking gun for the copyrightable status of APIs.",1336111328

This means lower experience and probably lower pay as well. So this means you will spend about 4 years not working to your maximum potential. 
A person who graduates will easily catch up 6-8 years after graduating. 
There are, of course, exceptions to the scenario described above, but usually I think what's described by me is most likely to happen.",1336111235

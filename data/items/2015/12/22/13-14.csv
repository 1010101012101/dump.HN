To me, a &quot;6&quot; would mean &quot;above-average&quot;.<p>Yet, the review actually says:<p><i>&quot;What’s not encouraging is the state of apps for the Lumia 950 XL. I wanted to switch back to using this as my daily device over the past two weeks, but I simply couldn’t hack it. It stayed in my pocket while I used my iPhone 6S Plus, simply because so many apps are still missing or inadequate on Windows Phone. I’ve been to a lot of events recently and need Periscope to stream from the Verge account, or to use Snapchat. I simply can’t do this with the Lumia 950 XL, and I can’t even access our Trello work app. If I can’t get my work done on the move, it’s really difficult to switch back to a Windows phone.<p>Microsoft’s original plan was to support Android apps on Windows 10 Mobile, but that seems very unlikely now. Most of the third-party apps are just poor ports from iOS and Android, and lack key new features. The Twitter and Instagram apps are still depressing examples of the state of Windows, and I don’t feel like much has changed over the past year. Microsoft’s mobile store needs some serious love, but it’s running out of time.&quot;</i><p>Seems like the &quot;ecosystem&quot; score should actually have been a &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;.<p>Followup clarification to the replies:  For those who think a score of 2 or 3 is wrong, The Verge&#x27;s own explanation for the scoring [1] says...<p><pre><code>  ...\n  2: Slightly better than garbage, but still incredibly bad.\n  3: Not a complete disaster, but not something we’d recommend. \n  ...\n  6: Good. There are issues, but also redeeming qualities.\n  ...\n</code></pre>\nGranted, those score explanations are for the &quot;final score&quot; instead of subscores but it seems reasonable to assume the subscores follow a similar internal rationale.  In the two paragraphs about the app ecosystem, the writer didn&#x27;t mention any &quot;redeeming qualities&quot;.

10777732,comment,10771031,10777444,0,0,pron,,,"> So wait, you are doing TCO? When my code &quot;unblocks&quot; it will look like it&#x27;s continued directly from the previous line, when actually the previous line called into some other code which then called into a continuation for the &quot;tail&quot; of this method, right?<p>No TCO. Your code doesn&#x27;t &quot;unblock&quot;; it unblocks (no quotes). The handler code doesn&#x27;t &quot;call into the continuation&quot; (i.e., there is no stack-growing call), it just resumes the continuation. Like unparking a thread (or not &quot;like&quot;; unparking a thread <i>is</i> resuming a continuation). There is a relationship between continuations and TCO in that they both deal with stacks, but in this case it only serves to confuse.<p>>  The point of the monadic style is for if I do want to manage the sequencing explicitly.<p>But how is `a = read(); print(a)` not explicit?<p>> More concretely I think the big advantage is that a monadic effect can be captured as a value.<p>Continuations are the same in that they are also a &quot;value&quot;, except that it is a mutable value. A continuation has a state (it&#x27;s current program counter). The calls to read and print trigger an OS handler. When working with continuations, those are programmable handlers, so their function is pluggable. You can run the continuation calling read and print with a handler that actually does IO, or with one that does something else -- just like with monads.<p>> You draw an analogy with checked exceptions in Java<p>That&#x27;s only to explain the typing. Java&#x27;s checked continuations are an effect system, and the list of thrown exceptions can be viewed as a list of effects a function may have. That&#x27;s how you can ensure that a function calling read and print will only be called within a context that implements a handler for those effects.<p>> most Java developers avoid using them, regard them as a failure<p>Off-topic, but that is a myth (there was an unscientific poll about this in the last JavaOne conference). If there is a failure is not with the concept, but that the standard Java libraries overuse checked exceptions (this may be addressed). Most Java developers like the concept (according to the poll).<p>> and I think a big part of that is you can&#x27;t safely factor out the result of a call to a possibly-exception-throwing method as a value.<p>Don&#x27;t think of checked exceptions in this context as actual exceptions, but as a list of effects. The same &quot;problem&quot; applies to monads, and is actually a good thing -- as you said yourself -- to have the type system ensure that monadic methods are called within the appropriate monad only. This kind of effect system also ensures that a function with effects is only called when the needed handlers are in context. The difference between continuation-effects and monads is that a function making use of continuations can use multiple effects without requiring nasty monad-transformers (and that&#x27;s exactly the problem Kiselyov wanted to solve with his handler system).<p>> Do you just mean non-Haskell languages?<p>Basically yes (but Idris, Agda and Coq are also pure).<p>> I don&#x27;t think &quot;pure&quot; is binary in that sense: all languages have some things that are managed implicitly by the compiler/runtime/infrastructure and some things that the developer is expected to manage implicitly.<p>I certainly agree in theory: what constitutes an effect (except IO) is indeed up to the language to define, but those languages I listed allow <i>all</i> effects (including IO, which is an &quot;absolute&quot; effect) without declaring them explicitly, hence they are not pure.<p>BTW, there is another absolute effect (i.e. an effect which is externally observable, and thus must be considered an effect regardless of the language&#x27;s preferences) -- time. Haskell (and Idris etc.) don&#x27;t have a good mechanism of handling that effect, which is one of the reasons I am not fond of the Haskell-style pure-FP.<p>As a nice demonstration of that problem, there are two ways in Haskell to write a function that sleeps for a second: one that is effectful (monadic) and one that is pure. Also, many people believe that Haskell has only one function inhabiting the type forall a: a -> a (a notion that is at the core of Haskell&#x27;s equationality myth), when in fact there are infinitely many, all different from one another.",1450792488

Our study\nof 552 children at preschools in France (299 children from French nursery schools) and Germany (253 children from German kindergartens) measured skills that facilitate the\nlearning of reading, writing and arithmetic at primary school. We also evaluated educational family practices and parents’ expectations of their children’s pre-school education. In order to take into account the hierarchical structure of our data, multilevel models were used in the analysis, which was carried out using MLwiN software version 2.02 (Rasbash et al.2005). <i>Although French nursery schools emphasise academic learning, we did not find any significant differences in overall performances between the French and German samples.</i> However, significant differences were obtained for some subscale results.

I mostly object to portraying it as a stable group of people directly descended with no immigration or adaptation. People changed languages, religions, etc. as borders and rulers changed, as they migrated, and for various other reasons. For example some of today&#x27;s Greeks are descended from Hellenized Arabs, Persians, Turks, Italians, Romanians, Albanians, etc., while some of today&#x27;s Italians are descended from Greeks, Visigoths, and others who became Italianized. And these migrations and assimilations also changed the cultures as well as adopting them, especially when they lived side-by-side in multicultural cities. That used to be common in Europe, especially in the big maritime cities and imperial capitals: cities like Vienna, Thessaloniki, Constantinople, Trieste, Rhodes, Gdańsk, Marseilles, and Vilnius were multicultural and multilingual up until they were turned monolingual (often violently) in the 19th and 20th centuries.

You cannot just start writing data and when it fails be upset with the product. Opentsdb is no silver bullet to the metrics game but it sure as hell is better than most at a larger scale.<p>We are doing right now roughly 1.2m/s and will likely grow to 6-8 depending on how we chop this up. Either way you have to use any level of intelligence with this product as you do with others. I cannot stress this enough but plan out your data. Make sure you are very strict with the pattern of how things get written and the amount of tags you allow. No datapoint will initially make sense for you you may have to shift things around a bit. There is an active PR collectd that addresses metric mapping which can be very beneficial to high throughout shops.<p>Either way just make sure you know what you are getting into and understand your problem as well as your product you are choosing.

I am not aware of any evidence showing this may be harmful, so in the end, I think it is up to the parents and the kid.<p>However, how do you know that &quot;having more skills is good under virtually all circumstances&quot; when toddlers are concerned? I have no reason to assume that learning to read at a very young age is harmful (which is why I&#x27;m not against it), but I can easily imagine ways that it <i>could</i> be harmful (or beneficial). But making a definitive ruling either way requires knowledge that neither I nor you possess. So I say &quot;go ahead if that&#x27;s what you want&quot; just because I&#x27;d rather not recommend against something unless it is shown to be bad.

Since then, I have accumulated tons and tons of work (personal and for work). These range from running PPC campaigns, social media marketing consultant for hundred-million dollar company, logos/print design, and even a game-hack that I wrote 10 years ago for SC:BW. I was an odd child.<p>However -- About 75% of them are just simple (but professional) websites that I have made as a freelancer over the more recent years.<p>1) What would you include in the public portfolio?<p>I feel that potential clients / employers may like to see that I try to be well-rounded and always curious to try new things. But I&#x27;m not sure how others would think about my SC:BW hack called &quot;BagFullOfSh!t&quot; (can&#x27;t make this up, you can Google &quot;BagFullOfSh!t ghoztcraft&quot; if you&#x27;re curious lol). Sure, it was 10 years ago when I was 12, but does it deserve a spot -- on my professional portfolio?!<p>2) How would you organize your portfolio?<p>I was thinking of putting them into categories, such as &quot;Logo Design,&quot; &quot;Website Development&quot;, &quot;Social Media Marketing&quot;, etc. But a lot of them overlap with eachother. I could also organize it by client instead of project -- but I&#x27;ve worked with some clients more than others. I&#x27;d love to hear your input/suggestions/inspiration.<p>3) What can you include in your portfolio, morally and legally?<p>For example: I&#x27;ve had the wonderful opportunity to do some social marketing work for the LA Dodgers (just a small project; custom app on Facebook). However, there was a middle-man advertising agency that reached out to me. Morally, I feel that I can post this project in my portfolio, since I did do 100% of the actual work. Legally, however, could it have repercussions on me?<p>Thanks for bearing with me guys. I learned a lot from my last AskHN thread, and I am deeply thankful. It&#x27;s hard to have thoughtful discussions like these on Reddit, and I am loving this HN community!",1450789646

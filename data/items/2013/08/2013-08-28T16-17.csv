Unless you mean two machines sitting side by side in a data center or perhaps within the same metro area connected via <i>wired</i> connections.<p>Two machines sitting on either coast of US with the best wired connectivity at either end are at least 70-80 ms away from each other. That&#x27;s not &quot;low&quot; latency.<p>Connected via anything less than a perfect connection on either end, now you&#x27;re looking at 100+ ms latency.<p>One of the ends is on non-wired internet connection (LTE, Wimax etc.) and now you&#x27;re looking at 150+ ms and with high standard deviation (in ping latencies).<p>Slow pace of  latency improvements is as much a fact of life as the slow pace of battery life improvements.

Well.<p>But the impressive part of Arnie&#x27;s physique from a modern standpoint is the symmetry and attention to detail, not really size. We have steroid-driven monsters like Ronnie Coleman that makes Arnie seem like a starving child these days...<p>I think the bigger problem with bodybuilders as an ideal is that most people don&#x27;t understand that Arnie didn&#x27;t look like what he looks like in most of his published photos for more than a few minutes on stage every year. E.g. at his peak shape, yet cut as much as possible, dehydrated, pumped, oiled, artificially tanned, and flexing to the max.<p>That&#x27;s not what Arnie level bodybuilders look like if you meet the on the street, or in the gym...<p>I like to point people to Conan, as in the actual movie rather than the posters. That was Arnie in the kind of shape that let him win Mr Olympia in 1980, yet if you look at the movie rather than the posters and pictures most people are used to seeing of Arnie, his seems big but his shape doesn&#x27;t seem all that unachievable - that&#x27;s the difference that competition prep makes...<p>People also misjudge size of bodybuilders in pictures massively, I think, and seem to believe they&#x27;re huge giants mountains of muscle. Consider that Arnie at his peak was roughly 105kg, at 6&#x27;, and with a 34&quot; waist. There&#x27;s tons of untrained guys larger than that - bodybuilders like Arnie just looks massive because of their shape and low body fat.<p>Of course most people <i>still</i> won&#x27;t achieve Arnie&#x27;s physique, especially not without steroids, but you can get &quot;close enough&quot; to his day to day appearance much easier than most people think.",1377709041

For example, some of the subjects can be a bit rote, but my youngest has half of his classes taught in french (even though we are not french speakers).

If you think about it, the average long term nominal interest rate in the economy is going to be roughly in line with nominal growth of GDP, because there are market mechanisms in place to make it so:<p>If the nominal interest rate exceeds nominal growth in GDP, then wealth effects (aka people have more money thanks to interest and therefore spend more) will eventually encourage faster growth of nominal GDP - either by stimulating more production (real GDP growth) or by driving up prices (inflation), or, more likely, by a mix of both.<p>If nominal interest rates are below nominal growth in GDP, then it becomes more profitable to borrow money to invest in production. People will do this, and this will adjust interest rates up (you can understand this from two directions: on the one hand, profit is being spread around via interest, on the other hand, demand for loan drives up interest rates).<p>These adjustments do not take over night - they probably operate on the timescale of years (unfortunately, economics tends to pay very little attention to <i>how fast</i> such market mechanisms operate, so we basically have no scientific basis for such statements, just common sense and gut feelings). Still, you cannot escape those adjustments of the interest rate in the long term.<p>What does this have to do with governments, inflation, and financing the deficit? <i>If</i> the government consciously acted to increase inflation to finance its deficit [1] this would indeed temporarily benefit borrowers. However, this is a temporary measure and certainly not the case today. Furthermore, governments have also consciously acted to decrease inflation, which obviously has the opposite effect. So in the end, it&#x27;s at best a wash.<p>One last point:<p><i>the Fed does in fact purchase US Treasury Bonds without requiring the Treasury to pay back the debt</i><p>The same happens in the real economy as well. Firms operate using debt that is effectively never paid back. The debt is regularly rolled over, sure, but it is de facto permanent and contributes to a permanent increase of the money supply, which is what matters (if any of those quantities matter).<p>The Fed does buy mostly Treasuries to create the monetary base (which is necessary for purely technical reasons), but what else would you have them buy? I personally wouldn&#x27;t want &quot;my&quot; central bank to gamble on risky assets.<p>[1] Also, I find it fascinating that the goldbugs never point to actual examples where this happened.

The concern evinced by TSA, NY PAPD, and JetBlue was that Mukerjee was a danger to the flight he was trying to board. We know he wasn&#x27;t! This article routinely supplies innuendo about Mukerjee&#x27;s evasiveness during screening. But we know he had nothing to be evasive about, and thus that the signals TSA picked up on were false; the article&#x27;s framing puts the onus for that on Mukerjee, incorrectly.<p>* <i>TSA&#x27;s rationale for detaining Mukerjee doesn&#x27;t deserve the benefit of the doubt</i>. The reasoning supplied by this article could be applied just as effectively to an 85 year old grandmother or a 10 year old boy. It&#x27;s not falsifiable and not relevant to what happened.<p>* <i>The analysis glosses over the pivotal moment in the story</i>. The problem wasn&#x27;t that Mukerjee was denied water or questioned by people that don&#x27;t know anything about the world&#x27;s third largest religion. <i>The problem happened when TSA refused to escort Mukerjee, with his carryon, out of the airport</i>, as they are required to do when a passenger refuses screening. Mukerjee&#x27;s own account has him trying to leave, but put in a position where doing so would cost him his bag and computer. <i>That&#x27;s</i> the problem here.<p>There&#x27;s a worthwhile case to be made for skepticism about some elements of Mukerjee&#x27;s story. I agree with the article that it seems unlikely for PAPD to have searched his house. It&#x27;s interesting that Mukerjee claims he was interviewed by an FBI agent when no record seems to have existed of that. I buy the analysis that says that a coherent rebuttal to Mukerjee&#x27;s story could not easily have self-assembled from 3 different security agencies in the span of a couple days.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard to take skepticism seriously when it&#x27;s framed in an article that seems hellbent on taking TSA&#x27;s claims at face value.",1377706810

In fact, just the thought of eating something like that is mildly repulsive.

It is fine if you don&#x27;t like Phusion Passenger, but please don&#x27;t say things that are untrue.<p>The open source version of Phusion Passenger is <i>not</i> a crippled version. It is used in production by many large users, including New York Times, AirBnB, etc. Your statement that the open source version is &quot;crippled&quot; goes right against the fact that we&#x27;ve been actively developing the open source version ever since Enterprise came out. In fact, open source development has become <i>more</i> active after Enterprise than before, thanks to Enterprise funds. If you check our commits at Github you will see that the rate of development has accelerated. If you take a look at all the new features in the <i>open source</i> version of Phusion Passenger 4 you will see that it is improving at a tremendous rate.<p>It is not true that the open source Phusion Passenger drops requests and serves 502 errors to users on every single deploy. Upon touching restart.txt, the open source versions blocks requests and resumes them after having restarting 1 process. The blocking only happens for the first process, not for the ones after. At no point will requests be dropped or will errors be served. We even have integration tests in place to check for this. If you see request drops or errors in the open source version, please contact us and we&#x27;ll have a better look at the problem. If it&#x27;s a bug, we&#x27;ll fix, it&#x27;s that simple.<p>&quot;popping up shareware nag-screens at random intervals&quot; is completely false. There are <i></i>absolutely no<i></i> nag-screens in Phusion Passenger. The open source version of Phusion Passenger is open source, so if you don&#x27;t believe me, then dig into the source code and tell me where exactly the nag screens are.<p>The lack of rolling restarts in the open source version is not a secret. Our documentation clearly mentions the differences between the open source and the Enterprise version. With a few clicks, you can find out what the open source version does and does not have.<p>And actually, the open source version does not &quot;lack&quot; rolling restarts, it just does not automate it for you. You can implement rolling restarts using Phusion Passenger Standalone (open source version!) in the same way you do with Thin and Mongrel, i.e. by swapping sockets. It works fine and some of our users do exactly this. It is just more work than the automated, polished, error-resistant version that Enterprise offers.<p>And finally, you Unicorn and Puma &quot;fully-functional&quot; while implying that Phusion Passenger is not. This is not true. There are features in the open source version of Phusion Passenger that Puma and Unicorn does not have. The reverse is also true. It is even true that Unicorn has some features that Puma has and vice versa.",1377706037

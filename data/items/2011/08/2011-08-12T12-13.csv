2876994,comment,2873531,2875542,1,0,iqster,,,"Thanks for taking notice Matt.<p>Let me start by giving some kudos. I had a chance to use a GUI tool that lets a developer test FB API calls. I'm not sure if this is officially released yet but it was a fantastic tool and a step in the right direction! (fyi: I got the link from a presenter at a hackathon ... forget the details).<p>Like some of the other folks here, I have burned many many hours trying to get the FB API to behave nicely. I think the core issue is documentation coupled with the velocity with which things change. I understand that the mantra for the company is ""Move fast, break stuff"" but I don't think it is right for you to cause developers pain. While you folks might have a lot of dev resources, not everyone does. A lot of times, I can see the API changes being done for good ... i.e. rename paramters or move'em around. The problem is that if you don't flag the change and/or documented this, you've pretty much guaranteed developer pain.<p>I understand when you move fast, you don't have time to document. People naturally turn to blog posts. This adds to the pain because half the stuff works while the other doesn't. My experience using the API at a recent hackathon was piece together fragments from different blogs and hope for the best.<p>So if there is one line of feedback you take from this .... if you change your API, <i>think</i> about it from the external developers standpoint.",1313152600

Twitter's API is helped a great deal by every client built by Twitter is also built on the Twitter API.<p>Google's APIs, in my experience, have great documentation and an excellent learning curve. Want to do something simple? Well here's code that does that. Want to do a medium challenge? Use that code and this documentation to expand it - often projects can gain sophistication quickly with only tweaks here and there.<p>There's no doubt the Facebook API is terrible. You have to read several pages of text and answer a bunch of obtuse questions just to get your app registered. Then you have to deal with the oft mentioned documentation problems. The biggest problem I see is that its so hard to develop for, no one has built any decent third party libraries - as opposed to Twitter which has a ton of excellent libraries for interfacing with your favorite language.<p>I can't help but wonder if all of this is done on purpose.

2876957,comment,2875211,2875211,3,0,alexholehouse,,,"I implore everyone commenting here to;<p>a) Listen to the actual statement [1] (or even better debate) - DO NOT take what CNN, Metro or anyone other news outlet says for granted. Journalists want to sell newspapers/adspace, parliamentary debate is often not the most glamorous thing in the world, so there is a certain need to spice things up. Reporting can be factually accurate while remaining bias or even misleading.<p>b) Do <i>NOT</i> draw unconditional comparison with incidents in Libya, Egypt or Norway. It's ignorant and more than anything belittles events in those countries.<p>c) Understand that the reporting of these riots by the international community, or more importantly the profiling of those involved, has been unreasonably flattering. The absolute majority of people in the UK have no sympathy for these people. This is not a class, race or age issue. Clearly, I cannot speak for all British citizens, but the only people I've seen with anything complementary regarding those involved in the riots (and I say riots, which are separate from the initial protests, which are a whole other kettle of fish) are ill informed and closed minded. This is not an uprising of the social underclass - it's rioting by a tiny fraction of people who have been systematically failed by elements of multiple governments' social, economic and education polices, but that does in no way give them to right to behave as they have. Many thousands more are in the same situation and did not participate, but rather displayed horror at the events.<p>This is not meant to be inflammatory - there are many problems which need to be addressed, both in terms of policy, as well as the more worrying collapse of morals and underlying social detritus which again is very much not a class, race or age factor. These riots are symptomatic of that.<p>However, in no way did David Cameron (who is not my favourite person in the world) propose an all out social media ban, and I feel that by omitting the (""... for rioters"") in this title is somewhat misleading. The government will discuss the situation with the companies at hand (initially RIM/Twitter and Facebook), and if a workable solution presents itself, this will be debated in parliament. David Cameron is not an expert on social media, but would you expect him to be? That is the reason for these meetings. That is how democracy works.<p>This is not a knee-jerk and blanket reaction (as seen in Egypt/Libya) but one that will go through proper process. There is already an e-petition which has attracted enough supports to force governmental debate on the subject of removing benefits from rioters [2], a poorly thought out move in my opinion, but one that will nevertheless be debated by parliament. People are angry, and the government must respond to that without being too heavy handed. This is not straightforward, but equally a lack of review regarding social media's impact on the riots would be irresponsible.<p>d) (And not really relevant here at all, but it's been winding me right up) BlackBerry is a brand of phone. RIM is the company that makes that phone. Officials cannot talk to ""BlackBerry"", they talk to RIM - it's like saying officials will talk to ""BigMac"".<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/pm-statement-on-disorder-in-england/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/pm-statement-on-disorder-in-...</a>

6687409,comment,6680763,6683739,9,0,chris_mahan,,,"There is no technical solution that works when the federal government can seize/inspect/hack into any computer located in the United States or in friendly countries, as well as hack into computers anywhere in the world. They can then access the decryption private keys of anyone, and thus all encryption can be defeated, along with any other means of attempting to hide information from prying eyes. If Google itself is unable to protect its own network from NSA intrusion, what makes you think anyone else is able to?<p>Remember, the NSA is tasked with spying on Russian, Chinese, (and everybody else&#x27;s) systems, and given that the Russians and Chinese have great mathematical and computing minds, is should be assumed that the NSA is employing equally great minds in the USA in order to penetrate the military (including nuclear and biological weapons systems), government, commercial, and individual systems of these foreign powers.<p>That the NSA turned the sophisticated looking glass inward to spy on the citizenry, in such an insecure manner, is the problem.<p>The other problem is that, well, citizens of the United States can be terrorists. If the NSA is tasked with stopping terrorism, then they, of necessity, need to monitor everyone, including US citizens.<p>So the answer lies in the terrorism part: Everyone went bonkers wondering why the government agencies were not able to stop the Boston bombers, yet when they do try to collect information and analyze it in a manner consistent with stopping this threat, they are then denounced as violators of the Constitution.<p>I have a sobering proposal: We tell the NSA to not worry about terrorism.<p>On the other hand, we come to terms with the notion that terrorists do what they do because it does terrorize us, and we make a conscious decision that we are going to not care anymore and accept a certain amount of casualties in exchange for the government not spying on us.<p>We accept that 30,000 Americans die on our roads each year in car accidents. We accept that another 30,000 Americans die of gun violence every year. Could we not accept that 30,000 Americans die of terrorism related incidents every year?<p>I lived in France in the 1980&#x27;s. We had a lot of terrorism. Bombs in malls, bombs in restaurants, bombs in the street in front of synagogues. After a while, callous as this may seem, the French just stopped caring anymore. It had become routine. Then the terrorists stopped. There was no reason for them to keep doing this, because the French would just put it on page 4 of the paper, next to the political scandal section. The police would close the street, clean up, etc.<p>Yes, these were tragedies for the families, but not more than the tragedies for victims of gun violence, drug overdose, and horrible car accidents that mangled the bodies of children beyond recognition.<p>Taking away everyone&#x27;s car is not the solution to car accidents. Taking away everyone&#x27;s guns, swords, pick-axes, chainsaw, power drill, kitchen knives, and banning boxing, wrestling, and martial arts is not the solution to murder.
Likewise, taking away everyone&#x27;s freedom is not the solution to terrorism.<p>Because taking away everyone&#x27;s freedom&#x27;s been tried before, and the human spirit of freedom asserts itself, and people die on both sides as they rebel and attempt to overthrow the oppressors.<p>And that is why the NSA and other agencies that spy on Americans must be muzzled.",1383796612

At no point do you mention the closing or cashing the check. Your approach is perfectly valid for most B2C stuff, but as a B2B guy, this looks completely foreign. Definitely a learning experience for me at least. As a B2B, this approach would IMHO fall on its face miserably, but I can totally see how this would be effective when more users == more value and sales-guy-on-a-phone is not scalable. That said, for B2B people, I would be highly skeptical that this approach would work. When your market is small, you had better have closers on the line to ring the bell.",1383796433

As usual, I searched online and found people discussing some simple catches, such as caused by mistakes without root privilege, or the hosting site does not allow to edit, etc. I waited for a long time to chat with the hosting tech support and got response that it&#x27;s going beyond the support area with the VPS customized environment.<p>Fortunately after hours of frustration, I worked out the simple answer with the root cause that I was  trapped by myself due to my previous setting.

Additional, the common and strongly recommended pro-privacy behavior is to use a new address per transaction, and businesses need to do that to sort out which payment is which.<p>So it was actually surprising that the figure was as low as it was... but what it wasn&#x27;t measuring was &quot;hording&quot;.",1383793546

Here is what did and didn&#x27;t work:<p>Didn&#x27;t work: reading techcrunch and HN waiting for a great startup to drift by. I reached out to a few of the companies that were big on HN and TC, but at that time (because they were on TC and HN) they were swamped with emails and usually at a critical stage in the companies growth. Thus, wasn&#x27;t a great time to try and chat.<p>Beyond that, I couldn&#x27;t get a great feel for the companies (the people)from their sites alone. And this is just as important as the idea, if not more.<p>Worked: Talking to people who you know in SF and in the startup world. I spoke with a friend of mine at a startup - he introduced me to other friends. who introduced me to other friends. and before you know it I had a dozen phone calls lined up. I think I was able to get passed along for a few reasons: 
-I had a good short blurb on myself that folks could forward along. It showed that I was hungry. 
-I had a personal website so that people could read about what I was up to. 
-I knew what size company I wanted and was flexible with pay.<p>Also worked: talking to recruiters at VC firms and incubators. They have tons of contacts and know great places to look.<p>If you have ones in mind, then sure. reach out. I found that people are surprisingly friendly to young folks who want to learn.",1383793358

Also, I prefer coding to dwelling on a previous life.  :)<p>You say: &quot;My view is that the Israelis viewed him as &quot;the devil they knew&quot;, and that he was infinitely preferable (and more controllable) than Hamas.&quot;<p>I say: That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re getting it wrong.  It wasn&#x27;t a choice between Arafat and Hamas, it was a choice between Arafat and Abbas.  Abbas was clearly preferable (for all the reasons stated above).<p>You say: &quot;...it&#x27;s not at all clear to me that there was any Palestinian leader with anything like real power who did want a deal. I mean.. Abbas? Seriously?&quot;<p>I say: Yes, Abbas, seriously.  Sharon was pursuing a strategy that was largely unilateral - in other words, a weaker leader on the other side was fine, as long as they didn&#x27;t get in the way and kept the PA running.  Arafat was in Sharon&#x27;s way (not a good place to be historically).<p>You say: &quot;The endorsement is meant for US consumption.&quot;<p>I say: No, I am absolutely sure that the Israelis are deadly serious about a Palestinian state (or something that can be called that).  Israelis are terrified of the &quot;demographic bomb&quot;, which is what they call the far higher fertility rate of Palestinians.  The Palestinian birth rate threatens the Jewish majority even in what is currently agreed to be Israel over the next few decades.  Giving away areas of current Israel with high Arab populations to the Palestinian state is often mooted as an option in a final status deal, in exchange for bits of land covered with Israeli settlements (which would be a double win for Israel).<p>Don&#x27;t want to write more on this here.

6687182,comment,6680763,6686481,5,0,pnathan,,,"So a dictionary defines chilling effects as the inhibition or discouragement of the exercise of your rights.<p>Let me frame the thought by giving an example: if I am talking with someone, I might not say a few things because, hey, the TLA might care enough to pull the record and listen in. Or we take care to communicate with GPG or something. It <i>inhibits</i> what we do. We can still vote; our vote actually has meaning; our votes actually change the elected officials, etc. We still can run a socialist candidate (c.f. Kshama Sawant 2013 in Seattle) and they aren&#x27;t shut down via police action or other hardcore discrimination.<p>This is in contrast against what it could do: it <i>could</i> be always used to harass and discriminate against those dissenting from the Two Parties and the State. <i>Anyone</i> who said anything <i>would</i> be looked at and actions taken to shut them up and limit the expression and formation of dissent.<p>While the database of communication could be used against people to significantly disrupt everyone who speaks out, it is not, and in my opinion, it will take a few emergencies like 9/11 to actually alter the mindset of the US to make that acceptable.  Of course, people <i>are</i> harassed; some people <i>are</i> okay with that. It doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s general acceptance of that, and it doesn&#x27;t mean everyone is harassed.<p>Thus I draw the distinction: people self-censoring vs. the heavy hand of an apparatchik forcing change.  The first is very immediate and to-hand; it&#x27;s <i>reality</i> today. The other is possible, possibly even probable given certain courses of events, but fear-mongering is not the best way to go; let&#x27;s deal with the clear and present threat at hand- chilling of free speech, chilling of dissent, chilling of the business interests of United States citizens, (frankly, these all apply outside the US as well, and hopefully the debate within the US around privacy and data capture also places the operations of TLAs on non-US citizens & non-US soil within the public purview of the United States citizenry via their elected representatives).<p>Fear does work as a campaign tactic, but the reality is, fear is not something people want to work <i>for</i>. People are willing to work for <i>hope</i> (didn&#x27;t we all see that in 2008?), and I really would prefer the pro-privacy, pro-4th amendment activists focus on the positives and hope of what we can do rather than performing the traditional stick of the Republicans & Democrats (vote the other way and the free work and the US will END!!!11!oneoneone). It is in hope of being not being tracked against my will, not being monitored in every phone conversation, not being advertised at without my consent that I advocate for these changes to come to pass. It is in hope that I can say thoughts and perform actions online and offline and feel the liberty of not having peeping government Toms and raucous advertisers know anything about me.<p>So there&#x27;s my distinction and my spiel. :-)",1383793245

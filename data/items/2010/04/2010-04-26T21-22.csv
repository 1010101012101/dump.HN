In a democracy, there is no theoretical reason why 49% of the population wouldn't end up in jail.  I certainly don't think this would be a good thing, but pure, untainted democracy does nothing to prevent it.  You say ""if more than half of the drivers exceeded the speed limit, well then, that's pretty much the same thing as having a referendum with a majority of voters saying that the speed limit is too low"", but that's really a straw man, because nowhere near half of all Americans are in prison.<p>And in our case, those in prison are not drawn uniformly from the American population.  Prisoners are disproportionately from a minority (intended in the ""not majority"" sense, not in the skin color sense, though I suppose in this case either applies) subculture, and unfortunately, that subculture glorifies many types of criminal behavior, most of which I imagine you wouldn't favor legalizing.<p>Again, it's perfectly valid to say that drug laws are wrong and here's why, and that if your ideas were implemented, incarceration rates would be much lower, and that this would be a good thing.  All I'm disagreeing with is the general notion that saying laws should be abolished simply because doing so would lower crime rates isn't persuasive.  I mean, we could get rid of <i>all</i> the laws, and then the incarceration rate would be zero, but something tells me you wouldn't like that.",1272318891

Yea, Muhammad when he was portrayed always either has his face covered by a veil or by light.

Usually, Muslims will also not portray Prophet's companions but the rule is mostly for the Prophets, Angels, and God.

This an extreme paraphrasation and may be wrong, but this is how I understand it as of now:<p>According to tradition, if the Koran/Mohammad contradicts itself, what ever happened later is to be taken as the accepted rule, however the Koran is not organized in chronological order so it can be hard to tell at first blush what is the ""correct"" interpretation. In the early days of Islam, when Mohammad had very few followers, it was necessary to gain more followers to espouse peace, rainbows and sunshine. As he grew more politically powerful, his rhetoric changed and ""kill the infidels"" was the way to go. Since it happened later chronologically this is the ""official"" stance of the Koran.<p>Contrasted with the Bible wherein most of the violence is contained in the old testament. Then Jesus came along and essentially said ""forget all this old stuff, I'm the new covenant, love thy neighbor, yay rainbows, sunshine and lollipops"".<p>That being said, that doesn't mean a lot of people haven't been killed in the name of Jesus, but in current times I'd guestimate 99.9999% of Christians are peace loving people who don't want violence brought upon someone because they are non-Christian. But I'd also guess that worldwide 97% of Muslims are the same way.

How about Egypt or Malaysia?<p>Some clarifications on the ""portrayal issue"": (1) Muhammad has been portrayed in many Islamic miniature paintings, always with a veil, though. (2) The tradition in Islam that no likeness of him can be created is coming from his words reported by ahadith, not from the Koran (e.g. see here <a href=""http://www.answering-islam.org/Muhammad/pictures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.answering-islam.org/Muhammad/pictures.html</a>). This was most probably a reaction to Greek-Orthodox Christianity with their heavy use of icons.

1296177,comment,1295676,1295676,0,0,mjw,,,"(Posted on the article too, but might be more use here) Nice set of articles, but a teensy bit one-sided in places.<p>What about the programmer who comes across as being a prima-donna about introducing some flavour-of-the-month practise, but who isn’t able to justify it in terms of measurable impact on the bottom line to (say) a small business owner. Often they’ll be right, but frequently they’ll be wrong too. I’ve often been guilty of this as a programmer–I want to change some code to make the design more elegant, add more tests etc, but if pressed it’s hard for me to say whether the improvement adds any value for the business. Sometimes it will, sometimes it won’t. Sometimes despite its value the opportunity cost may be too high. Either way as a ‘good programmer’ I will feel strongly about the matter, and it’s my boss’s job to try and temper that programmer “I only want to work with good code!” gut feel with a bit of business-oriented practicality.<p>So yes, the extent to which you indulge the 'great programmer' is always going to be a tricky call, especially for the non-technical, or even the technical-but-non-specialist. On the one hand you don’t want to piss off the talent–and let’s face it, some (not all!) of this stuff really is just that, in the same way a hollywood producer lays on whatever perks the best actors demand. On the other hand you need to have confidence that there’s real business value in activities that are being proposed. Or if not immediately demonstrable value, a way to measure reasonably objectively over time what impact they’re having. For example, Google (from what I hear) have an amazing system to measure (in some reasonably useful sense) the value of every test that gets written.<p>On top of that, sad truth is that a lot of companies don’t actually need great programmers. Sure, all else held equal they’d like them, but they’re expensive, they often want to spend your money bringing you into line with the latest and greatest–and sometimes it really is sufficient just to keep some old ball of code ticking along. I wouldn’t really want to work for one of these places, and doubtless neither would you, but it’s an acceptable deal for some programmers and some companies, and there’s a more nuanced perspective available than just to patronise them.<p>The other thing with great programmers is that if you don’t give us a sufficiently interesting problem to work on, we’ll often go and invent our own (whether consciously or not).<p>That might be a plus for someone like Google, or sometimes for some kinds of start-ups, but not so much for some more pedestrian smaller businesses.<p>Or perhaps behaving like this makes one not a great programmer, depending how you define it. It's not a one-dimensional quality I suppose.",1272317355

The evidence quite strongly suggests that the extremists on the whole really do make rather calculated decisions about what to push, even if only subconsciously. We can tell, because when we change the incentives, behavior changes.<p>You are basically arguing that the perfect should be the enemy of the good. If there is an extremist that attacks us no matter what, then frankly our policy doesn't matter <i>for that extremist</i>. We need to be concerned about the ones that are calculating though, because there are far more of them.<p>(Hostages was not a comparison, it was an observation that most terrorism is in one form or another about hostages.)<p>Your arguments are contradictory; you invoke extremists so extreme that it doesn't matter what we do, then you say we shouldn't incite them. But by definition, you've created a set of people that are unincitable, they're already permanently incited to the max. Yup, they exist. I'm actually pretty comfortable saying ""Kill them"". Anybody who truly, honestly wants to make it ""Either your civilization dies or I die"" must be taken up on their offer. However, these people do not numerically amount to all that much, even in the part of the world that has been deliberately cultivating a large group of people who are supposed to make that demand, making the horror of my suggestion <i>MUCH</i> less than it seems; the damage these people can do to civilization is far greater than the loss. (I can not underscore this enough; the evidence is that my approach is <i>by far</i> the more peaceable, because it produces a situation where civilization is to people's advantage. It is the production of a situation where attacking the civilization is advantageous that produces chaos and death! Second order effects <i>utterly dominate</i> this discussion.)<p>Your approach is a recipe for increasing the number of terrorists, not decreasing them.",1272317338

There are a lot of great things about managing engineers, but once or twice I've had direct reports who get extra-pissy when I would ask for details. ... details which, in fact, were vital to dig into, because once I had these details I found out that there were huge areas of rot in the structure of the plan.",1272315815

At that point, it's very possible that the founders/company will act out of loyalty to you rather than purely out of self-interest, at least until their ability to do so runs out.<p>And I disagree vehemently that one should feel no loyalty to their startup. I know of at least one startup that has run out of money without sacking their employees, and the employees agreed to waive their pay until the startup was able to get its cashflow going again. Had they all immediately bailed as you seem to imply they should have, that startup would be dead now. Instead, I believe its current valuation is around a billion.<p>I would hope my employees would do the same for me.",1272315682

=j means 'indent this line and the next'
=% means 'indent to the matching brace'
=/foo mean 'indent to the next occurrence of foo'
1G=G means 'go to the first line and indent until the last one'
If you want specific rules for indenting file types, you can put stuff in your .vim/indent/ folder to define them",1272315638

Use any other vim ranging construct (e.g. "">2j"") to indent wider ranges--i.e. the current line plus two lines below.<p>""="" is the autoindent command. Vim recognizes many languages and you can give it plugins to understand more. Use ""=="" to autoindent the current line. My personal favorite, ""gg=G"", jumps to the top of the document and autoindents the entire thing. One time at work I was gently reminded how many spaces I was supposed to indent per the company's coding standard. I quickly set the relevant editor parameters and with four keystrokes my code was compliant.<p>I think there's a code-folding ability but I've never used it.",1272315606

Here's a video by YouTube user louisstamour that shows the exact animation:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ASoqmyj19A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ASoqmyj19A</a><p>Apple's code is complex; my demo is simplified because I wanted the source code to focus only on the core idea of the animation -- the main phone stage that rotates and translates. All the other moving parts in the animation follow the same JS pattern as the phone stage: for each of the six states, there's a Slide object that contains JS objects that define the x, y, rotation, opacity, etc. for each element. These properties are applied to their respective elements when that state is transitioned to. See gallery.js.<p>I hope my 5000-foot view is a good starting point for those interested in exploring Apple's source code for further explanation.",1331438377

I don't have any data that says ""There are X hackers in Tokyo, Japan but only Y hackers in Toad Suck, Arkansas"" so I can't even make assumptions about overall geographical spread.<p>For the sake of argument, let's keep the definition of ""hacker"" fairly loose:<p>- Someone who creatively uses/writes software/hardware, and/or<p>- Someone who studies security and how to subvert it<p>I think this is an interesting question for several reasons.  First, the challenge of coming up with an accurate way to gauge the number of hackers in the world is intriguing enough, without further breaking it down to ""How many hackers are within X miles of my location?""  Second, let's just assume we could know exactly how many and our locations.  Imagine finding out that your 70-year-old neighbor who bakes you cookies every Sunday in return for helping rake her lawn also enjoys reversing malware samples in her spare time.  Last but not least, I think no matter what the number is, high or low, I would be surprised.<p>So while this isn't a question I readily expect an answer to, feel free to ponder the details of such an experiment or to give a good estimate (along with good, solid reasoning, of course).",1331437968

That would be a neat gimmick, but I don't see it working out.<p>The issues are twofold:<p>1. The obvious, it reduces an attacker's search space by the guess accuracy, in this case 256 times. To maintain equivalent security you <i>must</i> compensate for this by increasing the work of your hash function 256 times. Depending on your password's entropy (and thus your default work factor) this may or may not be acceptable. For user-supplied passwords secure hashes should take order of 100ms -- 10ms at the least -- and increasing that many orders of magnitude is definitely <i>not</i> acceptable. This, alas, pretty much breaks the idea, but putting it aside:<p>2. There will be collisions. The odds of a particular collision are 1/256; since an 8-character password contains seven chances for a collision, ballpark one in 36 of your users will have at least one collision <i>during</i> their password. This means that to maintain the seamless experience, you need to check the crypto-hash on the server silently, without indicating checking or failure to the user (anything else would be confusing). This introduces a number of very weird problems which you can definitely not be sure you have accurately addressed.<p>So, not really a good plan for passwords. Still a neat hack, though.",1331436214

I would prefer a more scientific, even quantitative approach.<p>Reviewing the packages available on common-lisp.net, one notices that most of them, in fact the vast majority of them have not thrived. Quite a few have been sitting idle in permanent alpha stage since I graduated high school.<p>When it comes to claims about Lisp's superior expressive power (as claimed here for example: http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html), quantitative data are also lacking. The only hard metrics on the subject that I can find are from the Computer Language Benchmarks Game. Incidentally, these measure the length of code in gzip bytes, which seems like a more fundamental consideration than LOC.<p>How do they compare Lisp to comparable languages in this regard? Not favorably. Here I'm using SBCL, as the default referent of Lisp is usually Common Lisp, but you'll find broadly similar results with other Lisp implementations, like Racket.<p>SBCL vs Python 3:<p>http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=sbcl&lang2=python3<p>SBCL vs Ruby:<p>http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=sbcl&lang2=yarv<p>SBCL vs OCaml:<p>http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=sbcl&lang2=ocaml<p>And, indeed, SBCL vs Java:<p>http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=sbcl&lang2=java<p>Here, Lisp appears to be a teensy bit more verbose on average than Java, which brought unto the world such marvels as the anonymous inner class.<p>Are there any more objective (as opposed to anecdotal) measures for the superior efficacy of Lisp?",1331435663

Don't get me started on the latest Xcodes, which I have to use at work.<p>So, speaking as the target market, Ubuntu has created a horrible user experience with Unity, and have made it not worth the effort it takes to remove it. I will never run Ubuntu (desktop) again.<p>My Linux laptop now runs Mint, which is fine but cannot connect to a network without the Gnome graphical configuration tool for whatever reason. probably layer 8 or ID10T in this case.",1331435555

The vacuum feels cheap and the attachments are all a pain to use. It does work reasonably well for everyday vacuuming on a low carpet, though. Suction is good, bag-less is convenient, pivot ball thingy works well enough, etc. That being said, next time I think I'll hit up consumer reports first.<p>A good vacuum marketed as the greatest vacuum ever isn't really that bad.

For a while going away to US or the West has been the aim of our youth and needless to say this has caused significant amount of brain drain. The society is resistive to change, but change they will finally some day.<p>For example, a relative of mine immigrated to the US in the 90's. And is a successful doctor there. Now sometimes when he comes back for a vacation he wonders it was not such a good decision after all. There are plenty of opportunities in India. And you can economically well off too.<p>On the other hand. The cost of living in the US is too high, for the conservative and savings driven lives of Indians it becomes a little to get adjusted there. You life is driven by perpetual debt and insurances. Ultimately it looks like money is not for your luxury but you are for the luxury of money and big banks. Sure the infrastructure is a lot cleaner and there are high rises, it may feel like you in heaven for some time.<p>But on a longer run, spending your whole life paying off bank loans, credit card debts and all sorts of loans and debts. At the end of it you feel all that was not worth it.",1303700376

If your aim is to say build a functioning webapp, you can probably do it in 1-2 months by yourself. I started from scratch in Feb and released www.sgelections2011.com 2-3 weeks ago.<p>I think for 'business' guys out there feeling the need to be technical (like myself), don't forget that you're not trying to be the CTO (unless you really want to then its going take a lifetime of commitment). The tech is merely a tool for you to understand the technical aspects of the business better, not for you to take over it. Sooner or later, you want to get a real techie who lives and breathes it to come in and take charge.<p>Personally, I had a 6 month deadline to create a complete databound website by myself. Like I mentioned, I did in in about 2 months and wrote about that experience on my blog pragmaticstartup.wordpress.com if you feel like reading it.<p>Hope this helps.",1303700320

2480245,comment,2478658,2479004,4,0,kamaal,,,"The problem is people have a notion that people from big-brand colleges will always do well. Though this isn't true always. But I think that helps at some degree in eliminating false positives.<p>From my experience I see, often the best paid are the ones who hop jobs very often. They would have very little experience and ability to work. And often don't work at all. But they would have strong associations/connections and would have worked for big brands. And the HRs hiring some how think that coming out a big brand automatically makes you more qualified for that job.<p>The net result is a certain section of people(inefficient) go round and round every 1.5 years. The same talent pool keeps circulating between companies. Sooner or later their bluff is called and companies reach to a conclusion that there is no good technical talent in India. Which is of course wrong.<p>On the other hand, good folks who tend to hang on for some time learning and working for long term projects are treated badly, denied promotions and hikes. After all this the system still wonders why the good folks are not in enough supply.<p>It's simple, we don't reward meritocracy and we don't get people with merit.",1303699883

2480238,comment,2479071,2479366,2,0,jgesture,,,"Seeing all these types of articles as devaluing higher-education as a whole is going further than necessary and only considering phenomena such as Facebook, Microsoft or Apple (wildly successful software companies started by dropouts) is probably not going far enough.<p>As far as actual learning goes, educational institutions are great in cases where the knowledge is hard to access, expensive or dangerous. If you want to be a doctor, you can't just go to and get a cadaver or an MRI machine to practice on, these are expensive. If you want to learn how to run a nuclear power plant, you can't go buy radioactive material to learn with, there are national security concerns with that. Learning how to fly a plane is dangerous and planes are expensive. But educational institutions can address all of these issues.<p>Using the term bubble is perhaps an effort to sensationalize the issue, I'm not sure. In any case, I think it is certainly useful to look at fields where access to knowledge is easy, cheap and safe and ask if an institution is required for learning or if that's wrong thinking. It happens that writing computer programs is one of those cases. This is probably why all of these articles talk about software developers (them being posted on HN by programmings probably has something to do with it too :)).<p>Saying that a system produces useful results is not that same as saying that a system is optimal. Cars in the 1950s could get you places a lot faster than walking, but that doesn't mean they got the best possible gas mileage. Computers in the 1980s did amazing things, things that would be at least impractical without them, but 1980s computers could've been a lot better, orders of magnitude better. So, stating that educational institutions have useful results is not necessarily a counterargument to the deficiencies in educational institutions. In fact, I don't recall reading any article in this recent string of education articles that claims that the problem with the higher education system is that it doesn't produce useful results. In fact such a statement is easily and, probably, objectively, verifiably falsifiable. So this isn't a question of useful vs non-useful. This is a question of optimal vs non-optimal.",1303699671

Secondly, Mars has plenty of Sun and near-Earth day/night cycle, making it straightforward to grow food there. The day/night cycle also makes relying on solar power much more feasible, and makes direct communication with Earth more reasonable (since a location on Mars and on Earth will generally have line-of-sight to each other on the order of once per day).

You can go for another iteration if you want a really accurate square root, which roughly doubles your number of accurate digits each time: 5.75 + (33 - 5.75²)/(2·5.75) ≈ 5.744565, while the correct answer is closer to 5.74456264653802865980.  At that point, though, I think it's probably easier to calculate it as (5.75 + 33/5.75)/2.<p>You can even use this approach for taking square roots of fairly large numbers, just using the squares of single digits — factor the initial number into a power of 100 and a number between 1 and 100.

People who don't expect or want to be anonymous.   The idea was that individuals would get services through a provider's domain, so the whole system assumes less privacy than one would expect out of a product one uses to run one's own email.<p>Really, I would personally be happy to give my customers a discount if they were willing to post contact info publicly.   I mean, I wouldn't force the issue, because I know a lot of my customers really do want privacy, but my costs for hosting someone who says ""hey, this is who I am, send abuse complaints to me"" through rwhois on the IP or the like, and who handles those complaints without my help are lower than my costs otherwise.<p>I mean, I certainly understand and think it's okay that some people want to be anonymous, but you need to understand that you put yourself in a more expensive group by wanting that anonymity.<p>Now, is that 5 pounds per customer worth of 'more expensive' for a domain registrar?  probably not.   Abuse expenses are a little like insurance... 99% of your customers won't get any complaints, or the complaints they get will be resolved painlessly, but a few will be quite painful and eat a lot of time and money.  (unless you take the 'kick off everyone who complains' approach.)<p>I haven't implemented such a 'discount for using your own realname and your own abuse contact' yet, in part because I'm afraid customers will see it as anti-privacy, so I'm still feeling out the idea,   I'm just saying, there is an economic justification for it.",1303697174

Take additional billions and an engineering base from a newly formed space tourism industry and add that. And then maybe it doesn't look so crazy if SpaceX is sending humans to Mars on their own dime, independent of any government funding.",1303697118

Korea, or most of Africa doesn't mean we should allow the stuff Western governments are pulling to slide. I don't know if the countries that are orders of magnitude worse than the Western governments were always that way, but my guess would be that they were, at one point, not so bad, relatively. It was likely a slow path that led them to decline to the point they have today. I don't want to see my government go down the same path.",1303696846

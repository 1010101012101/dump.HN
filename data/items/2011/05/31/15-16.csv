But they found fault with the homegrown production methods: Guha and his staff made the concoction themselves in his lab, and the WHO delegation found his facilities wanting by modern pharmaceutical manufacturing standards. Furthermore, they found that Guhas studies did not meet international regulatory requirements for new drug approvalcertain data was missing. The final recommendation: WHO should pass on RISUG.</i><p>Is this an example of why health care is so incredibly expensive in this country?<p>Do these ""modern pharmaceutical manufacturing standards"" actually buy us extra safety?",1306857583
2603076,comment,2602463,2602938,21,0,PaulHoule,,,"More to the point,  Microsoft is continuously improving C#<p>I was at a conference back in 1997 where we came up with a wish list of features we'd like in Java for high performance computing.  We all knew it was useless to ask this from Sun,  but we did anyway.<p>The first version of C# had everything we asked for in it,  and even early versions of C# had a 'delegate' mechanism that was,  more or less,  method pointers.<p>C# 3.0 introduced support for functional programming;  it's certainly not like CaML,  but there's a reasonably fluent syntax for real closures -- with a little work in adding syntactic sugar it's not bad.<p>LINQ is amazing and people have barely scratched the surface of what's possible like it.  There's a system for manipulating ""Expression Trees"" that lets you do LISP-style metaprogramming.<p>C# 4.0 added covariant and contravariant inheritance for generics and,  unlike JVM-based languages,  it works the way it is supposed to without any lame workarounds.<p>Comparing C# to Java as a ~language~ is like comparing modern italian to ancient latin.  Changes happen in Java at a glacial rate after a tortuous process that ensures that when JDK 7 hits the streets it's going to be four years obsolete.<p>That said,  the Java platform has an incredible ecosystem around it;  using maven gives me the feeling I'm in Manhattan and can plug into an infinite library of amazing stuff.<p>The .NET ecosystem,  on the other hand,  feels like being a crossroads town in the middle of Iowa.  Occasionally you get something good like NUnit,  but open source offerings are anemic or absent,  and commercial libraries often come across like ads in the SkyMall catalog.  (Often you can implement the 5% of the library you need yourself in the time you'd spent talking to salespeople)",1306857582

2603013,comment,2595618,2600989,1,0,wbhart,,,"It <i>was</i> clumsily worded, for which I apologise. What I meant to be saying is that many atheists do not dispute the appearance of design, and even some scientists who are <i>atheists</i> do not dispute it.<p>I once sat with a large group of scientists at a certain institution and I heard the following words, ""and no matter how much it appears things have been designed, we must resist the temptation to see design in complex systems"" (statement was in the context of a discussion of complex biological systems). This became the topic of conversation, and there was broad agreement with this statement.<p>Even <i>if</i> you, and many like you, do not personally believe that there is an appearance of design, that would not change the fact that it is in fact a very common position. Many atheists agree with Dawkins on this. My use of the word ""many"" should of course not be construed to mean ""most"". That was not my argument. Nor should it be construed to mean that I believe their position is that these things <i>are</i> designed. That should be clear from the quotation from Dawkins. Despite the fact that on this occasion I was careless with my wording, I do not, in general, use the word ""many"" to mean ""most"". I mean that it is not a position held by only a handful of individuals on the fringe. In speaking with many atheists, I conclude that it is in fact quite a common conception.<p>Incidentally, whilst it is very much a minority opinion (here I <i>do</i> mean only a handful of credentialled individuals), there are atheists who do believe that many complex biological systems were intelligently designed. And I am not referring to people who believe life on earth was designed by extraterrestrials (in the little green men sense), which I feel is usually (maybe even always) not a scientific position.<p>What is more common is academics such as myself who accept that evolution happens, but who also believe in a designer. And again, I do not mean to imply that this is any kind of majority opinion or concensus. I mean that <i>relative</i> to fringe technical opinions, belief in a designer is common. But I shouldn't need to qualify every single word I use, should I.<p>So, getting back to the article, although I did not articulate it well, my point is that the article not only simplifies the science, but it grossly oversimplifies the diversity of opinion that exists not only amongst atheists and people who believe in intelligent design of some kind, but of scientists in general. To my taste, and this is nothing more than a personal opinion, I found the article to be greatly oversimplified. Moreover, as I pointed out in a post above, the argument it makes is not a new one, but a recycled one from at least ten years ago. As such, I felt that it very directly conflicted with the injunction on the HN faq to not introduce classic flamewar topics unless there is something genuinely new to say.<p>Certainly it should be expected that there are going to be dissenting opinions when an article of this nature is presented. Again, this is only my personal opinion, but I felt that the article stuck out like a sore thumb on HN, not because it was about the design issue per se, but because of the way it attempted to deal with this controversial issue. I feel that a scientific approach to the issue would encourage a careful examination of the data and of various hypotheses on their merits. The thing that initially bothered me is that the article did not even attempt to examine why this gross inefficiency was preserved by evolution. To me this is always a clue that there is something further to be understood, and more science to be done. I am not a biologist, but I am a professional academic with a science degree. I expect more from articles such as this and am prepared to say so, and defend my opinion.",1306856590

I experimented fully command line work environment: no browsers, no X-windows, only a few linux consoles you can switch among by pressing Alt-Fx. The transition was painful, as I had to look for command line equivalent to view pdf/ps/eps files, gdb is not as convenient as ddd, etc. However, my productivity gain was enormous, at least for the first a few days. The curve quickly flattened and began to fall, as I started to use command line browsers such as lynx/links and I discovered a few legacy games.<p>Another time I went even further: screw the Internet! I installed Slackware onto an old dell notebook and uninstalled all fun games and apps, unplug the wireless card and went to the public library nearby for a day.

This targeted practice should be a lot more effective and still obey the idea of what he's saying.<p>I guess maybe we understood him differently, because I thought that was the point he was getting at.<p>Regardless, I agree with the idea of ""targeted practice"" of each section. It's been awhile since I've done any serious piano playing, but my strategy for perfecting a piece was always to nail the final 4-8 bars 5x in a row. Then I would keep adding another 4-8 bars to the beginning of that and repeat the process until I could play the whole thing through.<p>I found working from the end to be much more effective than from the start. My guess is that it's less tedious since the new part is at the beginning, so if you're restarting after each mistake, you end up focusing on the new material instead of racing through the old boring material to get to the new stuff.",1306855535

2602858,comment,2602463,2602463,16,0,PaulHoule,,,"Java programmers who are looking for ""a better Java"" would probably be happier with C# than they would be with Scala,  although C# doesn't run on the JVM.  The ""Manifest"" mechanism undoes some but not all of the damage done by type erasure in the JVM,  so to some extent building a more richly typed language on the JVM is like driving a car with a broken window.<p>My first Scala program rolled off my fingers and worked the first time.  My second one ran headlong into a number of difficulties;  people pointed out that the newest version of Scala added some things (not in the book I had) that would make things easier and they were right...  sorta.<p>Now I've been doing fit-and-finish work on a mixed Scala-Java system written by people with PhD's in computer science and personally I think they'd have been better off writing the whole thing in Java.",1306854472

The best approach is if you can get some test data, in order to directly experience using the system.  If the user enters dates a lot, you better make the date entry method as painless as possible (no mouse popup on dates, maybe even allow for - or . as separators so operators can stay on the number pad, etc.).<p>Do they enter bulk records more than one-ofs then have it so they can bulk-enter a group of records, etc.  If you were told to do the entry what would you want to make your life easier.<p>As a programmer we think of the computer and how it reacts when running our code, it also helps to think of the user and how they react when using the UI.<p>Of course I know a couple of the problems with this - frameworks and IDEs, some of which don't give the programmer easy access to custom interface elements (or by using such tools the programmer is never aware of other ways to implement a UI).",1306854419

The site didn't really give me any expectations of what the gameplay was going to be like.<p>The intro made me smile when the fingerprint showed up. Didn't know which team to pick because I couldn't tell if there was any particular strength in each side. I went with Architects. I was imagining possibly have some powers from the surrounding buildings?<p>Game started and it put me on my home address, not current location. Awesome! how'd it do that? I liked the tutorial to the gameplay. It was clear.\nIt looked like you were using openstreetmap. I spent some time noticing the fog-of-war effect and the lighting.<p>The game started and I repeated the tutorial steps to advance. At first, I didn't see that I had to click ""collect my reward"" on the missions screen. Why not give the reward on completion?\nThe Missions screen is difficult to read. Even though there isn't much text here, I didn't read most of it. Everything is kind of center-aligned and difficult to understand at a glance.\nThe cloud-view was a cool effect, but the map was blurry here.\nSomethings I am looking forward to see: Other players in the game, and figuring out what to do to capture a gateway. I will definitely keep playing the game.<p>good luck",1306854146

And that was to focus on the marketing and the message and to pick a price point before actually designing. Even putative campaign backers told me that they thought being able to match up specifications and deliver on promises was just a technical issue.<p>The reality is, as many others have noted, producing inexpensive commodity consumer-electronics is a far more expensive proposition than many realize, especially when you&#x27;re talking about low manufacturing volumes or surprisingly tricky and expensive operations such as FCC regulatory compliance.<p>In the end I think this sort of thing is quite common… People hear and believe what they wanted to be true. And then they complain when companies cannot deliver on promises they made out of naïveté.<p>Sorry for potato quality grammar and occasional incorrect homonym… And being forced to use text to speech!",1425355180

For one, people are getting concerned about SMI at a time when research toward it is totally stalled---and I say that as someone who believes SMI is possible.  Stuff like deep learning, as impressive as the demos are, is not an answer to how to get SMI, and I think ML experts would be the first to admit that!<p>On top of that, nothing about the AI risk dialogue is new.  Here&#x27;s John McCarthy [1] writing in 1969:<p>> [Creating strong AI by simulating evolution] would seem to be a dangerous procedure, for a program that was intelligent in a way its designer did not understand might get out of control.<p>Here&#x27;s someone thinking about AI risk 46 years ago!  The ideas put forward recently by Sam Altman and others are ideas that have occurred to many smart people many times, and they haven&#x27;t really gone anywhere (e.g., at no point between 1969 and now has regulation been enacted).  I wish people would ask themselves why that is before making so much noise about the topic.  The only people influenced by that noise are laypeople, and the message they&#x27;re getting is &quot;AI research = reckless&quot;, which is a very counterproductive message to be sending.<p>[1] McCarthy, John, and Patrick Hayes.

The fact is though that we have absolutely no clue what chain of events would lead to that. In fact we have (almost) no clue what chain of events will lead to AGI in the first place.<p>The best way to know what will come from AGI is to start building it and seeing where the controls and capabilities are going. I personally think the AGI community needs to put more effort into a roadmap, which is done at every AGI conference to some degree.

9135927,comment,9134830,9135796,0,0,Animats,,,"There are three phases.  First, the machine and its software have to be approved before deployment.  That&#x27;s done at Nevada Gaming Commission&#x27;s lab in Las Vegas, and they require access to the source code. Here&#x27;s the application form.[1] The applicant must 
<i>(&quot;Provide the Lab with all necessary hardware, software and documentation to reproduce
programming and executable software. This typically includes a PC that contains no operating system, along with an operating system and compiler that is submitted on OEM media or downloaded from a verifiable source approved by the Lab. The documentation must include procedures for installing and configuring the operating system, compiler tools, libraries, certificates and anything else necessary to reproduce programming and executable software.&quot;)</i> The approved version&#x27;s hash is computed at the lab, and that&#x27;s what has to match on machines in the field.  There&#x27;s an official state program, the NVSGCB Hash Verifier, to check this.[2] It&#x27;s a Windows program (yes, I know) which checksums media and has a file of all the approved programs and checksums.<p>And yes, they look for hardware backdoors: <i>(The chairman may require
transportation of not more than two working models of a new gaming device to the new game lab of the board ... The lab may dismantle the models and may destroy electronic components in order to fully evaluate the device.)</i>[3]<p>The second phase is the field check. In the days of standalone slot machines, the field check involved an Gaming Commission inspector plugging the machine&#x27;s pluggable EPROM into a reader and computing its hash.  Now it&#x27;s tougher, but if the program is on some removable medium, it can be checked independently.  Downloading updates is prohibited.<p>The third phase is logging. The logging requirements require logging all gambling and maintenance activity on logging media that survive maintenance. Every time a machine is opened, that&#x27;s logged, too. In multi-machine systems, logs are kept both locally and centrally, and the central logging machine has to be physically inaccessible to the people maintaining the machines.  If something funny is going on, there should be enough info in the logs to find out what, and who.<p>There are lots of specific requirements, from two-factor authentication to random number generator design and testing.  There are many statements made under penalty of perjury. They even prohibit pop-up ads on slot machines, although advertising when the machine is idle and has no credit on it is allowed.<p>Just about everything they check for has been tried at some point by someone trying to cheat. They&#x27;re up against organized crime. This isn&#x27;t airtight, but it&#x27;s far better than what we have now for embedded consumer software.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gaming.nv.gov/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=2786"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gaming.nv.gov/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=27...</a>

The defendant is not allowed to challenge the jurisdiction of the original court in an enforcement proceeding--they were supposed to do that in the original trial (or in their appeal to the original ruling).<p>I think you may have overlooked that we are talking about a default judgement. If it were not a default judgement, then yes, the defendant cannot subsequently challenge the jurisdiction of the original court when the plaintiff comes around to his state to enforce the judgement.<p>If it was a default judgement, however, the defendant can raise a collateral attack on personal jurisdiction (and only on personal jurisdiction), at least in some states, such as California [1], New York [2], Connecticut [3], Florida [4], and Texas [6].<p>(That Connecticut case is a good illustration of how NOT to raise a collateral attack on personal jurisdiction. Boy, did that defendant blow it).<p>Massachusetts has a really interesting law on recognition of judgements from other states [5]. They enumerate the conditions under which a foreign judgement will NOT be refused recognition for lack of personal jurisdiction:<p><pre><code>    A foreign judgment shall not be refused recognition
    for lack of personal jurisdiction if (1) the
    defendant was served personally in the foreign
    state; (2) the defendant voluntarily appeared in the
    proceedings, other than for the purpose of
    protecting property seized or threatened with
    seizure in the proceedings or of contesting the
    jurisdiction of the court over him; (3) the
    defendant prior to the commencement of the
    proceedings had agreed to submit to the jurisdiction
    of the foreign court with respect to the subject
    matter involved; (4) the defendant was domiciled in
    the foreign state when the proceedings were
    instituted, or, being a body corporate had its
    principal place of business, was incorporated, or
    had otherwise acquired corporate status, in the
    foreign state; (5) the defendant had a business
    office in the foreign state and the proceedings in
    the foreign court involved a cause of action arising
    out of business done by the defendant through that
    office in the foreign state; or (6) the defendant
    operated a motor vehicle or airplane in the foreign
    state and the proceedings involved a cause of action
    arising out of such operation.
</code></pre>
Aren&#x27;t all of these things that would constitute sufficient contacts with the foreign state to grant it personal jurisdiction? If so, what is the purpose of explicitly listing them?<p>I wonder if the idea is that these are common things that people who want to raise a collateral attack on personal jurisdiction run afoul of, and so by listing them they hope that such defendants will realize they will not be successful and hopefully avoid wasting the time of Massachusetts courts?<p>The phrase that the Supreme Court seems to like when it talks about Full Faith and Credit and challenging judgements on jurisdiction is &quot;fully and fairly litigated&quot;. Once the jurisdiction issues is &quot;fully and fairly&quot; litigated (such as in the original court in the case where the defendant does participate), it cannot be subsequently challenged in a collateral attack. If the defendant does not participate, and so the jurisdiction issue is not dealt with, then a collateral attack is possible without violating Full Faith and Credit.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.guerrinilaw.com/Practice-Areas/Domestication-of-Judgments.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guerrinilaw.com/Practice-Areas/Domestication-of-J...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.starrandstarr.com/lawyer-attorney-1441037.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.starrandstarr.com/lawyer-attorney-1441037.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ct-superior-court/1598172.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ct-superior-court/1598172.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099/0055/0055.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Displ...</a>  (55.509)<p>[5] <a href=""https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/Chapter235/Section23A"" rel=""nofollow"">https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/C...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://jrjoneslaw.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/enforcement-of-foreign-judgments-in-texas/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jrjoneslaw.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/enforcement-of-f...</a>",1435821626

(Honestly, I haven&#x27;t yet found any downsides to bootstrapping vs. going the VC route, so I can&#x27;t list any).<p>As a single founder, you get the maximum leverage out of being good at what you do.  The ratio of deadwood at your company is either zero or one, so as long as you are in fact genuinely good at building things, you can get things built a lot faster than you&#x27;d ever expect to see at a larger company.<p>You also get maximum control over what you&#x27;re building.  No cramming in dumb features that don&#x27;t fit because somebody in marketing decided they might be a good idea.  No stepping on anybody&#x27;s feelings by cutting a feature they wanted or abandoning their vision for what the product should do.<p>And of course you get to play on the whole stack.  You get to make the schema changes for that new feature, as well as the back end, layout, and all the fiddly javascript bits.  And you get to market that feature and handle customer support for it and play Social Media Coordinator.  Racking servers, conference calls with Fortune 500 CEOs, it&#x27;s all your job.<p>Best of all, you get to decide how much of your life this thing is going to take up.  If you&#x27;re the kind of guy that needs to pour 80 hour weeks into his baby, sacrifice all his free time, lose his girlfriend, and live 100% for his business, then cool.  You get to be that guy.  Or if you&#x27;re more of a &quot;roll out of bed at 10am, check HN over coffee, spend a couple hours on a feature then head out to the mountains because the sun&#x27;s out&quot; kind of guy, then cool too.  You can be that guy instead.<p>Whichever path you take, chances are you&#x27;ll find your way to profitability at some point.  And when you do, those profits all flow directly into your bank account.  Granted, your &quot;impact&quot; might be &quot;limited&quot; in as much as you might never become a billionaire.  But hey, a few hundred grand a year will buy a lot of beer.<p>And since it&#x27;s really hard to set things up in a small SaaS business so that they consume more than a small fraction of your time once the basic product is out the door, you&#x27;ll have lots of free time to contemplate where and how to consume said beer.<p>All the best!",1435820807

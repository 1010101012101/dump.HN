2087750,comment,2059964,2060586,0,0,kposehn,,,"I read through all the comments to make sure no one else has responded. I'm more of a Perl developer then a Ruby developer, but these are my observations of the differences between the two.<p>1. Perl Versioning is more thought out. It tends to have more consistent versioning semantics. Experimental branches are done in odd minor versions. e.g. 5.11.x was the development version; where 5.12.x is the stable release. All further development occurs on 5.13.x, etc. Patch level changes on the stable version are for minor updates (that don't break compatibility) or security fixes. Major changes to the language that break things are enabled by explicate pragams. E.G. use 5.10; Major version numbers represent core changes to the language, and really represent a new language, that may or may not be compatible with the previous language. E.G. Perl 5.X.x V.S. Perl 6.X.x. This adherence to the value of having development and release versions trickles down to the modules themselves.<p>2. CPAN is both a tool and the Archive.<p><pre><code>   a. As a tool it is great for both developers and package maintainers. 

       i. For developers:

          * it allow them to install bleeding edge modules.

          * easily upgrade those modules 

      ii. For maintainers it allows them to:

          * query the Archive for various meta information (dependences {build, release}, author, license, etc)

          * download the modules and extract them

          * allow the creation of build tools (e.g. dh-make-perl,pbuilder) that automate the packaging of the module

   b. As an Archive, it provides a common place with an agreed upon standard.

       i. Modules on CPAN can be marked as a Developer release.

      ii. Modules on CPAN can also be marked as released version.

     iii. All information in the Archive can be Queried by the CPAN module, that is part of Perl CORE

      iv. Perl Core, the interpreter and build tools are well defined.

       v. Core modules are also well defined, and do not change at patch levels.
</code></pre>
So, package maintainers can easily package perl modules into their os specific packaging system. 
To make a Debian package on Lenny from CPAN it's as simple as: dh-make-perl --requiredeps --cpan Module::In::CPAN --build<p>If all your dependences are already in the system this will generate a deb for you, if not it will tell you the modules it could not find; so you can build them.<p>Perl modules allow you change where things are installed by respecting the various PREFIX config options.  From what I have read here, it seems this is not true of RubyGems.<p>I don't know enough about RubyGems to know if it does the additional things the CPAN tools does. But the main thing is Perl/CPAN works with Debian by following their rules, and making it easy for them to build deb packages.",1294642341

I believe that the intended context was that the dignitary was a member of the same organization/country as the people trying to rescue him/her, while the enemy combatants would be from a group opposed to that country. Your response, on the other hand, seems to suppose the existence of a third party (the dignitary, enemy combatants, and in addition a group which dislikes the dignitary and knows that he's a horrible person).",1294640651

2087664,comment,2086218,2086980,0,0,_debug_,,,"> Taleb reportedly made a multi-million dollar fortune during the financial crisis that began in 2007<p>""Reportedly"". Also, ""multi-million dollar fortune"" is really vague.<p>Sorry to spoil a good story, but the entire Taleb thesis is just a very entertaining way to say : ""Shit happens"". There is absolutely nothing new that he has to add, other than the entertainment and sheer drama. If there was, he would be able to publish it as a paper in a journal, not merely as a popular paperback. As an analogy, Taleb's position is akin to a religious zealot shouting, ""Science dosen't know everything"". Science's response is : ""Sure, we know that. Why don't you help push the border by proposing and publishing a better model?"". No, he is content to just shout from the rooftops and make a living out of it. Even his recent attempt to publish an academic paper in 2010 is full of negativity: it's just a way to say, ""You're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong. Here are citations to show you're wrong.""<p>Also, note that Taleb is merely an adviser to Universa. Any credit for profitability at Universa goes to their founder, traders and portfolio managers. When he was the trader (at Empirica), they had to fold the fund. That's when he wrote the books.<p>What fans of Taleb probably don't realize is that the enemy is not the models or the quants who published the models, who clearly stated their simplifying assumptions in order to make approximate models, (because Newton's laws are a good-enough intermediate model compared to <i>nothing</i> even though they may be wrong at extreme points, and that's where relativity comes in,) but overleveraging (trading with money that you don't have), and good old greed (using a model that states clearly on the label that it is only an approximation, 90% correct, as if it were 100% correct).<p>Taleb's recent arguments with Scholes (who was awarded a Nobel Prize for the Black-Scholes model) is like a dolt shouting a Newton, saying, ""But you didn't consider relativity! You must be jailed for that!"". So what, at least he DID something concrete!",1294639475

It will help them secure major enterprise clients, probably the govt. or with ties to the govt.<p>2. Great selling point to institutional investors come IPO time.<p>3. Navigating foreign business opportunities.<p>Although I&#x27;m not a fan of this move by Dropbox, it is important to note that Stanford has hired Rice as a professor as well. No one is abandoning Stanford, and the hits that Dropbox is going to take are going to be minuscule in comparison to the upside. This is just the hard reality.<p>Rice does have a lot of experience that is relevant to Dropbox and students at Stanford and I&#x27;d just like to leave it at that because at the end of the day, connections + experiences that come from being Secretary of State trump pure meritocracy or idealism.",1397134793

If that&#x27;s the case with most enterprise FOSS contributors, they most likely trusted the features of OpenSSL they were using. Thus no reason to go poking around that section of the code. It&#x27;s understandable why a team might choose to not perform an ad-hoc security audit of features that pass specs, even more so when such an audit requires niche expertise. We can hope this bug changes that attitude and more enterprises with the resources and knowledge start performing security and encryption audits. Just as your buildings have security guards, we need proactive and preemptive audits of at least the most common libraries is use, flagging of software that implement unaudited encryption libraries. A Travis CI like badge on GitHub for these audit metrics would bring attention to the problem. We could call it EncryptCI. Maybe this already exists?",1397134706

What you refer was based on the FPCX release back in the day. Since then it added the missing features (multicam, library management and tons of other stuff), and has regained market share. Actually it has been one of the top sellers for Apple. Professional editors that bashed it, have changed their tune -- you can find several articles and posts to that effect.<p>The whole backslash were because FCP7 was discontinued and initial FCPX didn&#x27;t have 100% parity. Plus, editors didn&#x27;t know how development works (can&#x27;t blame them), so couldn&#x27;t understand that a newly developed engine, re-designed to be future-proof, will have dropped features and might lunch without 100% parity.<p>><i>and OmniFocus is a toy piece of software... there are probably more users of Atom.io than Omnifocus ;)</i><p>You seem to have a very bizarro notion of what&#x27;s a &quot;toy piece of software&quot;.<p>Actually Atom.io is as fringe as it gets.

This means that I also over-estimate what other people know. Oh, Sally has a pure math degree from Harvard, let me be very careful talking about kernels around her. James studied Distributed Systems at MIT, I better over think my system design before I talk to him.<p>What I have realized is that, this anti-pattern comes in conflict with the opposite anti-pattern. The one that comes from people who hide their insecurities by being over-confident. The one that comes from people whose deepest fear is saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;.

7565578,comment,7565238,7565517,6,0,cyphax,,,"I think very little will change. A little background: The Netherlands has for a long time allowed for people to make a copy of media (video, music, but not software), for personal use. This included media you&#x27;d borrow from a library, for example, or even your neighbor. To compensate, carriers (optical media, flash memory and the like) are a bit more expensive because an additional fee (of several euros; height depends on the size of the medium more or less) is added to the price of said media.\nThen, the internet came to be and suddenly you could make a copy easily, but the rules were left unaltered, but the compensation went up in price.<p>A very important detail of the fact that downloading for personal use (redistributing, e.g. uploading, has always been illegal) was allowed even if the source was &quot;illegal&quot; (e.g. torrents, usenet). The reason for that is that it can be hard to tell whether or not the source you download from is distributing legally or illegally.\nThe above is now no longer OK, apparently, but if you borrow a CD from the library, you can still copy it for personal use just fine.\nWe&#x27;ve kind of reverted to the situation we had before the internet was mainstream.<p>The reason I think nothing will change is that &quot;distribution&quot; (I use this term loosely to allow a torrent site, for example, to fall in this category for argument&#x27;s sake) has always been a target, and individuals downloading for personal use never were. The organization tasked with dealing with copyright infringement has stated to keep its arrows pointed at the distributing side of all this, not the individual downloader.<p>I&#x27;d be very very surprised if it&#x27;s going to be enforced in any way, due to being almost unenforceable.<p>The media industry STILL has to work on giving the consumer what they want, and seeing as how Netflix and Spotify are good examples of services that are now available here and seem to be doing pretty good, it might be okay.",1397133896

Dynamically.<p>Yeah, because it&#x27;s a REPL so it has to evaluate every line of code that you give it. How does that work when you have code as a file and you run the main function of that file? You would have to run every line of the code. So what about code paths that are not taken? Do you just give enough input data that eventually all code has been run through? But then you &#x27;re not really running the main function, you&#x27;re running all the code of that program has, with whatever results and output that that might give. Obviously I&#x27;m not talking about Haskell here, which already has a static type system.<p>Is your claim that you don&#x27;t need a compiler to do type checking? Well, yeah, since type checking is not part of the source code translation. But it often said to be part of a compiler since it it often is often part of the semantic analysis phase. But if you have an interpreter you wouldn&#x27;t really have a compiler as in a program translator.<p>I interpreted &#x27;The interpreter can just complain to you when you try to run it.&#x27; as &quot;complain to you <i>as you are running it</i>&quot;.

The problem is that some pages have sidebars, some don&#x27;t but use the same widgets. A widget may be &#x27;cramped&#x27; by other objects at a wide browser size, then snap down to a single column view and actually be wider on the page when the browser was narrower than before. This looks awkward and element-size-based styles would prevent that and allow TRUE atomic design.<p>Imagine being able to align items to other items on the page or to a grid that is superimposed over the browser window. Useful for modals and alerts and all sorts of &#x27;off layout&#x27; content that you need to align. Much better than trying to use CSS to centre things because you can centre an object whose width or height you don&#x27;t know or can allow to change after the page has loaded.<p>Imagine being able to set a different style on an input that had 21 characters using CSS because you knew how many characters were in the input field and could style for different character amounts? What about a playlist that has three pre-made sizes for list items that keeps reducing the size according to pre-made styles to make sure they all fit as you add more list items.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t so much that CSS rules fall short of being powerful, it&#x27;s not the rules we need to super-charge, it&#x27;s knowing WHEN to apply the rules and using JavaScript to add real time feedback from the rendered page is the best way to do that right now. I&#x27;m already using custom data attributes and regular expressions in my CSS selectors and I need more logic to power them. I need to be able to measure objects and respond to them as data changes on the site with user interaction.<p>Basically, long story short, I want to mix THIS with THAT in the near future<p>THIS <a href=""https://ballr.com/new_design/tables"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ballr.com/new_design/tables</a>\nTHAT <a href=""http://staticresource.com/alijn/demo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staticresource.com/alijn/demo</a>",1397131884

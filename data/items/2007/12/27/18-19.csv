Besides, the whole system is hub for potentially thousands of users passwords, and that would worry me a little. <p>I supposed it'd use it instead of yahoo pipes or other mashup services - giving it lists of my friends' myspace pages and looking for new comments for example - but I would never give it my passwords.",1198781521

93029,comment,92792,93020,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Maybe I'm a complete idiot, but you are not making any sense to me at all.<p>\nNazi Germany was a culture, a society. It was a brutal, horrible thing that should be despised for the many faults it had. Mongol society was a barbaric, violent, awful society and culture that should be shunned. Paleolithic tribal societies were also brutish, superstitious, harsh, and murderous towards themselves and outsiders. Many were also cannibals.<p>\nHow is this in any way disparaging Germans, Mongolians, or people who may have come from a tribal background? <p>\nE-gad, man. We have to be able to make comparisons of how various things work. Some cultures work better than others. Sure, stupid people will extrapolate that to say that the _people_ in those cultures are good or bad. But stupid people do stupid things. That's no reason at all to give up on our duty as sentient beings to make comparisons and judgments. We don't give up living in houses simply because some stupid people burn them down. Why would we give up the Enlightenment because some cultures never grasped it?",1198780499

93025,story,,,2,7,joeguilmette,"Ask YC: Help Choosing A Platform",,"I posted earlier asking how to approach Drupal. The response was wonderful, I truly appreciate it. It is now clear to me that Drupal can be a decent platform in the right circumstances.<p>My friend and I, while highly technical, lack experience programming. He has hacked up Drupal before and gotten a few sites up for activists to organize actions, so he knows a bit how to get modules working with each other. While he's never written any PHP or anything, he's pretty good with CSS and HTML. <p>The site we're going to be building is pretty basic. Users need the ability to create an account, and we are going to offer a service to verify their identity via certified mail. Thus, we're going to need to able to support user classes, and to 'lock' some of their profile info once they verify their info. <p>For the site itself, we really only need a robust Group featureset. Public and Private groups, each with a fairly large list of information. Also, we're going to need an email form with a few data fields that forwards to the owner of the group (and doesn't get picked up by spambots).<p>Also, we don't need to worry about scaling this at all. If people like the service, and actually use it, we're going to probably end up canning whatever we make right now and rewriting it in something else. If people actually use the service money to hire a small team won't be an issue. <p>How difficult will this be for 2 guys with little experience to figure out? We both have time, and have been working on this long enough that hitting a 2 week brick wall trying to get a module working will not deter us. <p>Any advice? Is there some other platform besides Drupal that is so much better that it will overcome the fact that our only experience is with Drupal?",1198780063
93022,comment,92792,93006,0,0,akkartik,,,"Here's how joining an ancient army is like joining a contemporary startup: your goal is to compete with more numerous enemies by means of superior technology. You mobilize a group of people with promises of loot, rape and pillage, a share of the profits. The people around you take on risk for a chance to make it big. It's not as volatile as before, of course. Instead of losing your life you take a paycut, a hit in opportunity cost.<p>Here's how joining an ancient army is <i>not</i> like joining a contemporary startup: then your goal was to destroy and assimilate the enemy. Now it is to be happily assimilated.<p>---<p>People tend to consider the feudal system a step back from the glorious states that were ancient Greece and ancient Rome. In reality it's a step forward, employing standing armies in a decentralized 'p2p' organization rather than mobilizing armies for specific invasions.<p>Taking away loot as the primary incentive makes becoming a soldier more of a 'normal' career and less of a risk, more stable and less reliant on big payouts. This in turn gives a society as a whole less incentive to go marauding against its neighbors. The stability we have today in the west began then, with the barbarian Germanic tribes that later came to have knights and chivalry. Before we could have stock markets and acquisitions we had to stop fighting among ourselves.<p>:) Happy holidays everyone!",1198779924

93015,comment,92819,92819,0,0,bfioca,,,"This month I just finished my BS in CS.  I set out to complete it over 11 years ago, in 1996.  In 1997 I started working full time and have accrued over 10 years experience in qa, operations and sysadmin, software development, software engineering, management, and more.  The CS classes I'd taken along the way each contributed to my abilities, but out of context I can certainly see how if I had waited to finish my degree to enter the work force, I'd have been at a serious disadvantage.  Along the way, I never encountered a significant roadblock finding a job because I didn't have my degree - most employers never asked because I had enough experience after 2 years or so full time.",1198779452

93012,comment,92792,92792,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"I originally enjoyed this little essay, but the more I thought about it, the more certain things bothered me:<p>1. The word Thar: He doesn't want to saddle the Spanish, but is more than happy to saddle the Arabs. This is bad form and almost racist. Every culture in the world practices ""Thar"", why the disdain for Arabs?<p>2. Ignoring European ""Thar"" - With the exception of the Former Yugoslavia (Muslims - interesting), the author basically ignores the many examples of this in European societies, from Italian, Greek, Spanish, Russian. Hell, the Mafia is basically built on this, and last time I checked it's alive and well - but it doesn't even get mentioned. (FYI, I'm southern Italian... my grandparents are as ""backwards"" as can be sometimes.)<p>3. The real reason the west no longer follows ""Thar"" is because of the Age of Enlightenment (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment</a>). <p>Because it's only a few generations old (having happened in the 1800's) and was centered in Europe - by extension  North America  - it has simply taken time to reach other parts of the world. Namely, the mid east and Africa. <p>This is the reason that Thar - which enlightenment rejects - is still so prevalent in these societies. <p>4. The Bushido code IS ""Thar"". The fact is that Japan up until the end of WWII embodied ""Thar"" to a degree of perfection seen nowhere else on the planet cannot be excused away by a ""remorse shine"" in a doctor's office.<p>In fact, had the doctor been a true practitioner of Bushido, he would have killed himself long ago. The remorse shrine is a symbol of cowardice consistent with reason - imported from North America after WWII. (I'm not suggesting either one is correct) This shows more than anything that the doctor is conflicted between the notion of an insult to his honor, and the understanding that real sacrifice should not be required.<p>This is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt at pinning Arabs and Muslims with the moniker of backwards-stone age people that need ""educating"". If this is what qualifies for advanced cultural thinking in the US, its no wonder you're losing in Iraq.<p>>""It's considered bad form in many circles to criticize another culture's values.

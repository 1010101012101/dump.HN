2893248,comment,2891012,2891095,3,0,jamesreinders,,,"Good questions... We <i>are</i> open sourcing the entire runtime we use, and contributing to open source.  We have created an open source runtime project for use by any compiler, including gcc, and we will be using it ourselves (or we already do).<p>TBB is the most widely used abstraction (not OS threads like pthreads) for C++ parallelism (several developer surveys confirm this).  OpenMP is used by less developers in the U.S. surveys, but OpenMP and TBB don't really compete for developers because TBB is <i>very</i> C++, and OpenMP is not.  TBB was contributed to open source in 2007 by Intel, and is a very active project - with lots of users and ports virtually everywhere. Users include well known names like Dreamworks, Adobe, Autodesk, and EA in their key applications.  It's new enough (5 years) that many people have not yet heard of it... but it has a very substantial user base.<p>I'm biased a bit - but I wrote the book about TBB after learning of the project and loving it, not because I was on the project.<p>We believe in ""library first"" then (when you know what you are doing) put it in the language.<p>TBB was the library.  Cilk Plus is the language equivalent.<p>ArBB (Array Building Block) is the library.
It needs to bake still from what I see.  It's worth a look - but it is new and rougher... despite the RapidMind experience with product. These things take time.  I'd suggest it lives as a library for at least 5 years before we get too excited about trying to learn from it and change a language.<p>Cilk's been at this since the mid-90s.  TBB was our strongest way to say ""we believe in Cilk and we want the experience in product""... so we added 5 years of that to Cilk's experience, and I think we are very ready to show the results and argue we can be ready for standarizing.",1313535408

It was so bad, I could barely shift my car on the way home.<p>Over a decade later, my wrists hardly ever bother me.  Physical therapy taught me to regularly stretch my wrists, and how to strengthen them.  I began pursuing other activities which further strengthened my wrists (rock climbing is particularly great, so long as you avoid overdoing it and injuring yourself worse).<p>My basic advice to people now is:<p>1)  Follow the Pomodoro technique, or whatever it takes to force yourself to get up, stretch, and move around for at least five minutes per hour.  We all sort of hear that and nod, but think about how many times you've gotten really deep into a problem and sat there, twisted like a pretzel as you try to solve it, for hours on end.  You <i>have</i> to condition yourself to take real, meaningful breaks.<p>2)  Sit up straight, dammit.  In every photo we ever see of new startups, how many people are sitting with good posture?  None of them.<p>3)  Get a keyboard with light-touch Cherry key switches.  I'm partial to the Kinesis ergo line, but there are others.<p>4)  Get active.  Straighten your spine and go for a walk around the block a few times per day.  Take up yoga, climbing, martial arts, or weight lifting.  Focus on improving posture, flexibility, and balanced strength.  Find some hobby that will get you away from the computer.",1313535029

If you're still messing with the HTML at that point it can be pretty confusing for the user.

2893209,comment,2888739,2889890,2,0,noduerme,,,"Ostracizing people socially -- rather than using bureaucracy as a method of enforcing ever more bloated statutes -- is a tried and true human tradition. It happens all the time online. Note the emergence of up-ranking news sites, for instance. Downranking is a powerful form of social censorship that helps civilize the worse traits in human nature. To rely solely on law or on bureaucracy to keep people acting in a civilized fashion is to discard thousands of years of social/moral wisdom. The argument usually begins with moral relativism -- e.g. you don't know what it's like to be XYZ, you were born ABC, and how dare you judge anybody -- and ends with the credo that all is permissible. The problem with everything being permissible is that, contrarily, in a situation where there is a refusal on the part of individuals to judge each other, no individual has any rights. Their rights are either abrogated by the police and the faceless majority, or everyone's rights directly infringe on each other's, in an anarchic context that only begs for further control. Therefore, face-to-face settlement of conflict and the boundaries between individuals is preferable to settlement by the state, and also preferable to a complete lack of settlement. And THEREFORE, we must use the best tools in the arsenal to settle such conflicts on a local basis, which most definitely include humiliating and ostracizing and, yes, JUDGING people based on how they behave.",1313534633

But Buffet's message is the meat behind the whine:  If the playing field is <i>level</i>, people will figure it out, and the smart and savvy players will still succeed -- because they are not tying one arm behind their back while giving their opponent a nine iron.<p>I'd say that's a big part of his point about the current revenue system for the federal government (and many states', I would guess).  The small player is cuffed while the big player has sprouted extra arms (for grabbing).<p>I don't agree, or blindly accept, all that he has to say, and when you look behind some of his influence and advice, it certainly has played well into and payed out for his/Berkshire's own investments.<p>But the man has a point:  You have to <i>pay</i> for the things you use -- and that includes the rich.

Essentially your 'Primary Relationship' would be with the user, not the HealthCare provider as a vault for them to store their stuff and 'authorize a data push' to the healthcare provider on an ad-hoc basis.<p>The largest roadblock to an idea like this is that the healthcare industry is decidedly anti-innovation.  Not on purpose, its just how the economics work.  Industry consultants and solution providers have been trying to get e-health going for a LONG time, and only now are we seeing things like doctors carrying around ipads.<p>Integrating with healthcare systems involves either integrating with the large integrators, who dont have an api and who arent in the business of opening up hooks for data pushes (Unless their customer says they want to do it) for potential competitors OR hanging out with the small 1 doctor office medical practitioners who most likely dont understand their technology and don't understand why they need to move things online and 'into the cloud.'<p>I reached out to the drchrono guys to try to get access to their api so that I could build a proof of concept for this and do an end run around the established tech providers, but I never heard back from them.  Their API has been 'coming soon' for a long time.<p>If you decide you want to store information on behalf of the HealthCare provider, then you have to be HIPAA compliant and then getting something like this off the ground becomes an order of magnitude more difficult.  I looked at the process/paperwork for becoming HIPAA compliant, and it doesnt look that difficult, but it does look like something designed to keep small guys from entering the field.<p>Sorry for the ramble.

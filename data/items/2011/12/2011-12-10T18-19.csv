The drchrono CEO says that a ""security audit"" was done, but the article gives no details. Who did it, at what level, and where are the results?<p>Does drchrono assume <i>all</i> risk and liability for patient confidentiality? Is that spelled out contractually? Unfortunately, the problem is that even with such verbiage in a contract, individual physicians would likely not escape the rightful wrath of patients and regulatory bodies if a data breach occurred. Frankly, even if physicians did adopt a system like this, they'd have to provide disclosure and go through an informed consent process with their individual patients about the use of drchrono, and get written approval from individual patients to store their info this way. What happens when many (if not all) patients opt-out? Maintain two systems?<p>""Tell the court, Dr. Incentive, what drove your use of drchrono? Were you convinced that the system provided any benefits whatsoever to the patients who now have their HIV status, mental health diagnoses, and street drug use information plastered all over the net....or were you more interested in the $44,000 benefit <i>you got</i> from adopting the software?""<p><i>But, he [CEO of drchrono] says, with the iPad connected to drchrono's cloud-based platform, ""there's no information stored on the iPad except a temporary cache ... it's more secure than locally stored laptops and servers.""</i><p>This statement makes no sense. We've seen countless breaches and releases of protected health information from cloud-based systems. How is highly sensitive information transmitted to and stored on drchrono and/or third-party servers possibly more secure than leaving patients' data on local systems which are locally controlled, physically fenced (easily quarantined from the net), easily whole-disk encrypted, locally backed-up, locally audited, with locally set retention policies, and locally destroyed when needed?",1323541553

It's hard to evaluate the impact twitter had in the marketing world, but it is easy to see how it created new ways for brands to engage with their customers. Large success cases like Comcast or BA, and the fact that there's virtually no startup launching without a Twitter presence today to engage with their audience are good indicators of Twitter's impact.<p>I suspect twitter's given Dana and the UFC a huge vehicle to engage with people whenever they're not putting on events. It lets fighters, promoters, and the audience engage 100% of the time bi-directionally, and not just once every 2 or 3 weeks when the UFC is on the TV.",1323541551

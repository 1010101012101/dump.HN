Of course, in-space refueling is only in the concept stage (but getting solved!).<p>To get above 6km/s, the only way I know of would be to use induction tracks (see Lawrence Livermore patent in doc). The original problem with the EM methods was getting high power switches to work repeatably. They used to cost a fortune, and last only for 10s of cycles. However this problem was solved by a completely different industry in the last couple of years (connecting wind power to the grid), and now you can get them cheap on Alibaba.<p>The major difficulty, actually, would be:\n1) Sound pollution (not many places have high mountains, easy industrial access, and no local population).\n2) Hypersonic drag (which is quadratic with velocity at that reynolds number).

There was a year where I was working evenings and commuting to college during the day in my barely-running Cavalier.  Money was not abundant.  Thankfully, even though the distant parking lots charged us commuters quite a bit for day passes, they used a system with &quot;hang tags&quot; that you put on your mirror.<p>Each tag had a row of 12 &quot;bubbles&quot; and another grid of 31 &quot;bubbles&quot; covered with the silvered scratch-off stuff you find on lottery scratch tickets.  To use one of these daily tags you would scratch off the bubble corresponding to the month and date you were parking.<p>I soon realized that the parking attendants weren&#x27;t very observant and between that and the windshield, you could use one of those silver paint pens to &quot;refill&quot; in the bubbles after they had been scratched, use a fine-tipped Sharpie to draw the number back on the re-silvered bubble, and scratch off the next day.<p>Can&#x27;t remember how long I did this and I seem to remember eventually getting a ticket but it was right around when my car finally died and the year was almost over.  Either way, I could usually get a week or so out of those daily passes before a stray mark or penmanship error would ruin a tag and I&#x27;d have to start a new one.

A firm that manages ghost writing for executives was looking for someone who understands data science and is also a writer. As a practicing data scientist consultant I get the subject matter.  And, I have been an industry analyst (lots of writing), published magazine columns and have a website with lots of current work available to read.<p>It was interesting they expected me to provide a free sample, which they wouldn&#x27;t publish (really?) before proceeding.  I told them &quot;I don&#x27;t work for free.&quot; In the end I offered them a compromise. You read my portfolio of work and decide whether in theory you would like to engage me. We then set rates. At that point I write the first piece for your client. If you like it you pay the agreed upon price and publish the work. If you don&#x27;t like  the work, I will publish it, minus any references to your client or quotes he provided.<p>So even though they admitted they didn&#x27;t have any writers who could understand the subject matter they still wouldn&#x27;t budge from demanding a free sample.

I got tailed by the campus pigs (I&#x27;ll call them that because that was my experience with them) and stopped several times for no reason (and let off with a &quot;warning&quot; because whatever I had done wasn&#x27;t something one normally gets cited for, they basically wanted to check my papers and see who I was) because my truck was a decade too old and and several tax brackets too low to be common in that area.  They always seemed to see me like I was some tweaker who might steal and scrap their aluminum hand rails to get my next fix.<p>I figured out that parking way out back significantly reduced my chance of being ticketed.  More than once I saw the parking services truck drive up and down the rows making sure everyone had something in each windshield, not actually scanning them.  This was during the summer so there was always parking available and 90% of the enforcement I saw was during the first two weeks when everyone moved in.<p>The permits were a paper with a bar-code displayed in the center of your dash (students got ones that hang from mirrors).  I thought of just putting a piece of paper there but I figured any attempt fake would piss them off.  The policy was worded such that it made it sound like you only got booted after three UNPAID violations so I think what was happening was that when they put each new plate (all three I used were from the same state) into the system it didn&#x27;t tell them to boot it because no plate had more than three citations on it.  I got six tickets over the course of the summer.  Two, two and one on junkyard plates and one on my real plate.<p>Parking in the same place with a ticket under your wiper would probably work for awhile too.<p>When I looked on their online parking pass system I don&#x27;t recall a way to input a VIN so I assume they didn&#x27;t record it, just a photo that includes the plate and a description.<p>Like I said, I wouldn&#x27;t do this somewhere that the municipality does the parking enforcement.",1447097931

The author didn&#x27;t define CEP as it relates to Stream processing but this quora article does a good job of trying to:<p><a href=""https://www.quora.com/How-is-stream-processing-and-complex-event-processing-CEP-different"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/How-is-stream-processing-and-complex-e...</a><p>So instead of the database example of where you&#x27;d store your data and then ask questions about it, you&#x27;d ask the question first and then push your streams of data through the library and have it call you when the question you asked became true.<p>For a practical example of how this is used in algorithmic trading.  You might have streams that consist of market data, a stream for twitter sentiment, a stream for the sentiment of a real time news feed, streams to follow the futures market and a stream to indicate if there are any upcoming Fed reporting windows.<p>You might then create a streaming query to say notify me when a gold stock has 4 new daily highs in a 5 minute window and the gold futures are within 10% of their daily highs and no negative news sentiment for this stock has been seen in the past 30 minutes and there are no upcoming fed reports due today.<p>If this query reports back to you that this event has occurred, you could then translate this into an order to be sent to the market.<p>you give up some performance for the CEP overhead but it makes maintaining the logic much easier than having each algo have to manually track the state of each of those streams.<p>They also have the nice ability to make your back testing and unit testing easier by allowing you to step time forward in discrete intervals.  So if you have an application that needs to be notified 20 milliseconds after an event you can step time forward in a non real time manner, probably faster when unit testing to verify your call back is correctly called.",1447097866

The 8-bit conversion is not truncation, it is dithering.  Dithering to 8-bit does not introduce <i>any</i> distortion at all, whatsoever, of any kind.  If you don&#x27;t understand the mechanisms and the science of how bit depths work, then you&#x27;re going to come to false conclusions, like the conclusion that there&#x27;s any point to the Pono player at all.  We&#x27;re not talking about just &quot;subtle differences&quot; here.  In order for it to be even <i>theoretically possible</i> to hear the difference between 16-bit and 24-bit audio, you have to bring your audio system into a quiet room and then crank the volume levels well above into the threshold at which you can damage your ears, and even then, you still won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference with the most dynamic music.<p>So, suppose you have a quiet room in your house, with an ambient noise level of about 30 dB.  If you raise the 16-bit audio level so the noise floor is above 20 dB, then the peaks are going to be well into the 120 dB range.  That&#x27;s like having a symphony orchestra in the room with you, at the very peak of their performance, with all the instruments playing at once.  If you&#x27;ve ever listened to a symphony orchestra, you know that the background noise is NOT 30 dB, but somewhat higher.  So even at the peak of a symphony, your CD recording should still be able to reproduce the various unwelcome bits of noise that the musicians produce (stomachs gurgling, breathing, shuffling in their chairs, etc.)",1447097671

Employed people pay the same, plus unemployment, the employer handles half the paperwork but employees who don&#x27;t cross-check are penalized.<p>- Each of them have an application form and half of them are monthly. Most of them apply on weird rules (&quot;7.23% on 98.5% of revenue within limit of 1200 PASS if the revenue is ... and 1400 PASS if ...&quot;). Some of them are taken, but don&#x27;t give you benefits because you don&#x27;t fit the rules (as you talked about pumping money from workers). Some are taken and refunded later.<p>- There are lunch tickets and holiday grants, for about 200€ per month, your employer must fund the employee bureau for this, but you need to apply to get them granted.

In fact my impression at one place I worked was that the sensor gave a stronger signal doing this as the barrier to get out went up quicker for me than it did for cars. I have extrapolated this belief and also believe that the sensors that detect vehicles before traffic lights also give a stronger signal when the rim is close by and the lights choose to turn my way quicker as they think I&#x27;m a bus.

The reason the &quot;brutal&quot; techniques works is because of the amazing resiliency of the mouth. Wounds heal quickly, and teeth are rooted so deep they take a ton of punishment before giving out.<p>I&#x27;ve been lucky to find an orthodontist whose not afraid to do something advanced. Previously, I had 5 or 6 consultations from different orthodontists who, in some cases, wanted me to return within the hour to install metal braces.I knew that my mouth was a bit of a special case (impacted canine), but  I refused to believe that metal was the end game. I always asked for Invisalign, but they all said it wasn&#x27;t possible - until I met my current orthodontist. After a quick consultation, he comes back saying &quot;we&#x27;re going to try something different&quot;.<p>The man is a genius, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. He proposed a solution to straighten my teeth with Invisalign while making space to pull the canine into place with a cantilever. The cantilever is hidden behind my teeth, attached to my molar and secured with trans-palatal arch. He actually bent the wire around the top of my mouth to minimize its obstruction of the tongue. Painful, simple, but effective. I barely notice it. He cuts my Invisalign retainers by hand so they still fit in.<p>In the dental world, this is really advanced. I had to repeat the procedure several times to my oral surgeon (who did great work) before he understood that the chain pulling my tooth into place isn&#x27;t destined for a metal bracket, and must be sutured to my gum pending installation of the cantilever. Quick call to my ortho cleared everything up. Likewise, my dentist was equally surprised. Both said it was a great idea. According to my orthodontist, my treatment would be the subject of a paper, if he was still inclined to write them.<p>None of it seems very modern to me.",1447097034

The mediocre local public school was $5k per child, so I spent $10k instead and sent her to a great private school.<p>It is clear to me that the Australian government is only interested in soaking foreign workers for as much as they could get away with.

Gaming seems to suffer from a serious inferiority complex, where they hope by mimicking the dominant art forms they can gain legitimacy. So a game like Bioshock is seen as superior to a game like Ms. Pacman because it has all these &quot;movie-like&quot; qualities. It has nice production values, and a narrative, a soundtrack. In reality I think 20 years from now you will still have people trying to break high score records on games like Ms. Pacman and Donkey Kong whereas Bioshock will be seen the same way we look at games like Night Trap today.<p>I think the most damaging idea to ever enter gaming is the myth that it&#x27;s primarily a &#x27;narrative&#x27; medium. That is horribly reductionist and limiting. Games are about narrative generation, not narrative delivery. That&#x27;s the beauty of it. Each starcraft match is a narrative in the same way a professional chess match is a narrative. I think this is why let&#x27;s plays are so popular. You aren&#x27;t watching to get the game&#x27;s story, you are watching to get the specific narrative that is created by a certain person playing the game.",1447096896

And none are for ideologically-questionable industries, unless you include NASA in defense.<p>My &quot;anecdata&quot; does not disprove what you&#x27;re saying, but your statement doesn&#x27;t mean much to me when you add qualifiers like &quot;outside areas with strong tech sector presence.&quot; Sure, you&#x27;re going to have fewer options for jobs in rural areas, but isn&#x27;t that true everywhere?<p>In other words, the South has lower population density overall, but it still has areas of high population density, i.e., cities. And in my experience, the jobs in the Southern cities are no worse than jobs in other cities. You can find smart people using new exciting technology to solve interesting problems all over the South.",1447095711

Originally farming, then gold, coal, oil, and uranium. Britain has some natural resources in the North sea, but London has been a centre of intellectual wealth for hundreds of years: before there were startups, there were the Rothschild&#x27;s, banks, and every other kind of trader. Man Group started the first hedge fund in the world in London 200 years ago based on storms affecting the sugercane crop for their Royal Navy rum contract. Australia is still at the selling sugarcane stage.<p>So while the UK is a little more cynical than the US, it still appreciates the value can be created intellectually because it has that history. Australia doesn&#x27;t, because money is made by digging things up and selling them.

Perhaps there&#x27;s no shortage (unlikely given Texas&#x27; power needs), perhaps there&#x27;s transportation bottlenecks creating local oversupply? That price has to lower to send the price signal that the arb is there and firms can make money building that transmission, at which point, just like the other energy products in West Texas (crude), the relative price will begin to rise again relative to the benchmark. (See: West Texas / Midland grades of crude being priced at steep discounts that are now shrinking due to increased pipeline capacity coming online.) It&#x27;s not that Midland crudes were &quot;oversupplied&quot; it&#x27;s that demand was being &quot;artificially&quot; lowered by transportation bottlenecks. (Economists / econometricians may argue definitions with me on that, but from the energy trader perspective, that&#x27;s how I would approach it.)",1447095653

You have to maintain and repair it, peridocially update it, market it, insure it, compete with other similar properties for tenants, and hope that the tenants actually pay the rent and don&#x27;t damage it beyond the value of their deposit. You have to hope that your neighbor landlords and owners do the same so that overall property values in the area don&#x27;t decline. And that supply of housing doesn&#x27;t grow to the point that you cannot maintain your investment with the rent you are able to charge. If you can&#x27;t find a new tennant when the previous one leaves, you still have to cover all your taxes, insurance, and loan payments. Yes, the supply of land in any area is limited. This is like almost any other &quot;free market&quot; product. The fact that land supply is finite does not in any sense mean land ownership is a monopoly. The only monopoly owner of land is the government (emminent domain).",1447095651

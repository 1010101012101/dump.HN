I guess if you asked most of Facebook's users why they use Facebook they would say to have fun and connect with friends, not manage their schedule.<p>I guess that isn't good for Facebook's secret evil world domination strategy (is that still a secret) but not an issue otherwise.",1209981267

Microsoft was willing to pay a premium of almost $10/share on top of that.<p>There is a lot involved, but the process generally goes like this:<p>Buying company (MS in this case) meets with Buyee (Yahoo) and negotiates some price.<p>Buyee board accepts buyers price.<p>Press releases and such go out.  Much rejoicing.<p>EVERY shareholder gets a chance to vote, but things are rarely voted down.  Common shareholders generally end up voted the recommended way (in favor of the buyout), and large shareholders generally control enough of the stock that this isn't a big issue.<p>Sale is approved, and Buyee stock shares are exchanged for Buyer stock shares, at the ratio of their current prices.  If you held 100 shares of YAHOO, you'd end up with about 125 shares of MSFT in this case. (Yahoo being supposedly worth about $35/share, MSFT being worth about $28/share).<p>In some cases, these buyouts can be ""hostile"" where the Buyee can attempt to buy enough of the shares on the market to effectively control the voting.<p>These points are over-simplified, but it gives you the general idea.",1209980773

181310,comment,180870,180958,0,0,wumi,,,"expecting MSFT to beat a company and expecting them to be competitive are two different issues. as you've said in another post about all that $$ their sitting on -- they should be competing in several different markets, but showing up with a bunch of cash is simply not good enough to beat a well-worn competitor like Nintendo.<p>Game consoles are as much about the franchises as they are about the consoles themselves (Marios, Zelda, Mario Kart, Metroid, Smash Brothers, etc. for Nintendo ). That being said, it's nearly impossible to build a game franchise from nothing. Most best selling games are multiple-edition franchises (see: GTA IV, Halo, Mario, Smash Brothers, Call of Duty, All Tom Clancy games, Final Fantasy,etc.) MSFT hit the jackpot with HALO, and has a couple other interesting original titles such as Gears of War, Mass Effect and others.",1209979997

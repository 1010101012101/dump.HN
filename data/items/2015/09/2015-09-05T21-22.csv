I&#x27;ve seen way too many open source projects run by academics die a sudden death when the two or three professors that were maintaining them decide they didn&#x27;t want to do it anymore (or retired). In my experience, most academics are using open source tools not because they are better or even &quot;open&quot; but because they are free. 
Few users (if any) ever contribute code back to the project beyond
the occasional bug report making them essentially just as dependent
on the core maintainers as they would be on any commercial company.",1441490267

We know enough to say it&#x27;ll never be right. Even in the 90s, when we didn&#x27;t perhaps have hard earned experience, I think we knew enough to say it wasn&#x27;t proven secure, and therefore the safe choice would be less flexible.<p>No, it&#x27;s not specifying a particular backdoor, but if you make something hard enough you can be assured one will develop organically. And even if it&#x27;s not deliberate malfeasance, can we at least call it callous negligence?",1441490226

Alasdair MacIntyre&#x27;s framing of moral thinking as &quot;history-constituted tradition&quot; was sparked by Kuhn&#x27;s similar framing of scientific thinking. Except MacIntyre uses this approach to discredit the entirety of academic moral philosophy, from Hume to Rawls. And, while doing so, exposes popular ethical maxims as the arbitrary parodies of such work. He now advocates a return to &quot;Thomistic realism,&quot; initiated by Aristotle and developed by Aquinas.<p>Here&#x27;s one of his papers that outlines the application of Kuhn to philosophy: <a href=""http://www.ifac.univ-nantes.fr/IMG/pdf/Texte_de_Macintyre_1977_-_Intervention_de_Vincent_Boyer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifac.univ-nantes.fr/IMG/pdf/Texte_de_Macintyre_19...</a><p>On a slightly different note:<p>>Kuhn, like Popper, thought that science was mainly about theory, but an increasing amount of cutting-edge scientific research is data- rather than theory-driven.<p>Science always proclaims to be &quot;data driven.&quot; Galileo and the Ptolemaics were working with the same &quot;data.&quot; When Aristotle examined the bones of animals, he was working with the same &quot;data&quot; as Darwin.

For me the switch was as big of a switch as going from low-res to hi dpi phones. I really love that you can have good legibility with much smaller text in editors / terminal. After all I can say that while I am missing the docking / hub / power plug / webcam features of the thunderbolt display (colors where also better) due to the increased sharpness and the (perceived) productivity gains I would never switch back to less than 4k for a workstation screen.

The family business tends to have a pretty solid understanding of the market we&#x27;re in. We know who we are, who our competitors are and we choose our targets carefully. This has led us to profitable, sustained growth. At the start-up, we were going for crazy opportunities and saying yes to very challenge projects, something the family business would have said no to. Why? Because the start-up has to get &#x27;lucky&#x27; and find an unexpected opportunity that propels us forward.

As a teacher, when I wasn&#x27;t busy, you know, instructing, I was a mental health first responder, surrogate parent, law enforcer, stenographer, and so forth. I agree that, in general, social services should provide a baseline so that every child has a shot, regardless of what life situation they happen to be born into. I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s fair for that to fall so heavily on the schools.<p>In practice, this is exactly what seems to happen. And I think this over-reliance is a big part of what brings down low income schools. Even within inner cities, there&#x27;s effect where the most prominent and successful schools tend to scoop up the kids with the greatest relative advantage and the most challenging students are pushed down to progressively more impoverished schools. We end up with multiple layers of elective and systemic segregation. As Paul Tough put it [1], there are big distinctions within poverty, with those who are the very worst off -- in &quot;deep poverty&quot; in Tough&#x27;s terminology -- often being the people least effectively served.<p>The neighborhood schools often serve as social glue within their communities, but they&#x27;re measured academically against schools in more affluent communities that have the privilege of being focused much so on being good educational centers. When these neighborhood schools are labeled as &quot;failing&quot; for academic underperformance, they&#x27;re closed down and it can be a very traumatic local event.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying that schools that aren&#x27;t educating effectively shouldn&#x27;t be reformed, or sometimes shutdown. I&#x27;m just pointing out that the reality of the role they serve and all they&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t typically acknowledged or supported.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/magazine/obama-poverty.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/magazine/obama-poverty.htm...</a>",1441488287

My point is that your position is unfair. Your position seems to be that rational arithmetic is an obvious choice that other languages have been too lazy or stupid to adopt as their default. My point is that rational arithmetic is a fine choice for many things, but it is not a strict improvement over other number representations. Yes it can handle 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3, but your implied conclusion that it is an obvious &quot;default&quot; choice is not accurate. It is not as perfect, and floating point is not as bad, as you seem to think.<p>Yes, doubles have lots of values they can&#x27;t represent perfectly, but so do rationals. Like sqrt(2), sin(1), pi, or any calculations involving numbers like these.<p>Yes rationals can represent lots of numbers perfectly, but if you&#x27;re keeping everything exact these can start to take lots of memory. Some slides I found about Perl 6 indicate that Rat values lose precision if the denominator gets too big, to avoid using too much memory.  If this is true, the Rat type shouldn&#x27;t be thought of as an &quot;exact&quot; type any more than double -- it could cease to be exact even if you stay away from inherently non-rational number like I listed above.<p>What I&#x27;m disagreeing with overall is the dichotomy you are trying to create of: double=approximate, Perl 6 number=exact. Neither of those are really very true. There are cases where double is exact and cases where Perl 6 is not exact.",1441487310

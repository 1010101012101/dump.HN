In C# this statement is somewhat untrue, since you have structs that have value semantics (value equality). But why are there no other concepts within the language that help you from reinventing the pattern wheel?<p>For example, I had seen the singleton pattern quite frequently in a codebase I worked on, with the label leaking into the class name. But why is it that you have to write:<p><pre><code>    public class DatabaseConnectionSingleton { ... }
</code></pre>
and then deal with all the static stuff (i.e. x.Instance()) rather than<p><pre><code>    public singleton DatabaseConnection { ... }
</code></pre>
Like this, you could easliy use standard stuff:<p><pre><code>    new DatabaseConnection()
</code></pre>
and the runtime would simply return the same instance. This would keep people from reinventing the mechanism.

8983014,comment,8979886,8980088,0,0,alejohausner,,,"Greaber&#x27;s book on debt was really interesting.  The cancellation of debts is from Leviticus 25:<p>&quot;And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.  &quot;<p>Fascinating issue.  Graeber explains that poor farmers would borrow from the landlord, be unable to pay, and would end up sold into slavery.  Eventually not enough farmers were available to work the land.  An economic crisis would ensue.  Hence the bit about returning men to their families (to restore the labour force).<p>That&#x27;s part of the symbolism of Jesus.  He is the Redeemer because he is freeing people from the debt of sin.  The Gospels are using language that would have been very familiar to Jews who followed the law in Leviticus.<p>Graeber&#x27;s big point, which he articulates at the books&#x27;s outset, is that we have been brainwashed into thinking that paying off a debt is a moral obligation.  If you step back a bit from that idea, it suddenly seems strange and artificial to mix the concept of a financial obligation with that of a moral obligation.  But that&#x27;s what a lot of people do: they mix those two things together.<p>A lender always takes a risk that the borrower won&#x27;t repay the loan.  That&#x27;s why, for example, credit card debt, which is not backed by collateral, has high interest rates: the lender is covering his risk.  Lender and borrower are always conscious of the odds that the loan will go bad.<p>But when morality gets added to the equation, it distorts reality in favour of the lender, who can now appeal to a sense of duty or sin to confuse the debtor, and make him forget that the two parties in the loan are making a coldblooded calculation of the odds that the loan will be repaid.<p>Graeber&#x27;s other big point is that debt has, throughout history, been a means of creating slaves.  But that&#x27;s kind of another issue.<p>Great read.",1422859851

8982994,comment,8982620,8982939,0,0,jasim,,,"Thanks for your thoughts. I should clarify what I meant by templates.<p>Templates are driven by content, not by logic, and they are typically monolithic. This works well for web pages which are about content which doesn&#x27;t have much JS. The web was historically content-driven, which has started changing only recently with the evolution of Javascript and the emergence of web-apps. This historical quirk is why imperative construction of the view is unnatural form for developers. This is however going to change fast, because imperative view construction is the natural way to build web apps.<p>JSX templates are templates in the sense they do minimal string interpolation. Everything else is taken care of by programming language abstractions. They include control structures: conditionals and loops, and primitives for abstraction: variables, functions and objects. A template &#x27;programming&#x27; language on the other hand is a suboptimal mix. For example, Angular&#x27;s templating language reminds me of Greenspun&#x27;s 10th rule, which with suitable modifications, can be read like this:<p><pre><code>  Any sufficiently complicated templating language contains an ad hoc,
  informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of a 
  turing complete programming language.
</code></pre>

The other thing is that the pay gap also involves different personal choices, but some of it involves things that should be improved, such as the expectation of maternity leave, as well as women not feeling as strongly about negotiating higher pay, as many men do. These are things I feel should be improved over time. If this seems radical, then I see things a bit differently. I think we can discuss this civilly though, if need be!",1422857190

Mainly, I tend to have input data tables for forecasting, cost estimation, and so forth with a lot of data inter-dependencies and calculations.  It seems going back to the method of handling data updates through onchange events in a manual fashion would be a colossal step backwards from say, knockoutjs.",1422857116

<i>Dr. Emma Watson has been training for the adventure of a lifetime: to study living beings in space. But her mission aboard the International Space Station turns into a nightmare beyond imagining when a culture of single-celled organisms begins to regenerate out of control -- and infects the space station crew with agonizing and deadly results. Emma struggles to contain the outbreak while back on Earth her estranged husband, Jack McCallum, works frantically with NASA to bring her home. But there will be no rescue. The contagion now threatens Earth&#x27;s population, and the astronauts are stranded in orbit, quarantined aboard the station -- where they are dying one by one...</i><p>Movie:
<i>Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) in command of his last flight before retiring. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness.</i>",1422857047

Must not be very many. I have a small number of close friends, that I talk to at least weekly via some method. But then I have probably around 100 other friends that I talk to not that often, but still want to be friends with, and another 500 people that I like to know what they are up to, but thats about it. For example, I went traveling recently, and one of those 500 happened to post before I left about a trip they made to the same place. I asked them about it, and found out about some cool things to do in that place. That is extremely valuable to me , and if you have a way to replace that type of interaction outside of Facebook, I&#x27;d love to hear it.",1422856918

2072687,comment,2072164,2072445,0,0,JesseAldridge,,,"It's the word ""modality"" that throws me.  The word by itself is pretty vague -- ""somehow related to a mode"".  The linked Wikipedia article is dense and confusing.  You explain it as a way of modifying a statement.  Then you say a publication is an ""extended modality"".  That requires another mental stretch.  How does the abstract idea of ""a publication"" connect to modifying a statement?  One expects you to explain that in the following sentences, but you don't really.  Instead you follow with the seemingly unrelated statement, <i>""A researcher may wish to state a conclusion: “water boils at 100 degrees celsius”. Convention dictates that he should initially add various hedges to his conclusion: ...""</i>  So when writing a publication a researcher will customarily add hedges.  What does that have to do with a publication being an ""extended modality""?  Is it really necessary to use such an obscure term?  It seems like it shouldn't be this hard to understand what you're saying.",1294264669

He edited the statement because he was bullied into it, not because it was nonsense.<p>I would try to avoid words such as ""modality""---""qualification"" might be better---but the point he makes is clear. He spends several paragraphs defining what he's talking about and then makes a case. It actually follows the lemma, lemma, theorem formula closely. He goes on to offer evidence for his point.  Summarized, he says: over time citations can lend credibility to an otherwise unproved statement. He then says programmer productivity disparities haven't been conclusively demonstrated. That might have been a better starting point for the article.<p>He's guilty of disorganized writing, and being influenced by literary theory, but his point is otherwise legitimate and capable of being proved or disproved.

Activation Energy, it's a thing",,"I am sure that everybody has tried at some point to use some sort of productivity software.  A to-do list, project management software, or a personal wiki containing personal wisdom.  I am equally sure that most of them have stopped sometime shortly afterwards.  For all the wisdom that you have, it feels like you will just remember it, and have no need to open a browser, navigate to the wiki, create a new page, and delineate all that you have learned.<p>Some people must have succeeded though, and some of those people must have been as lazy and dedicated to instant gratification as the rest of us.  I wonder how they did it.<p>For example, I would love to use a nested to-do list, with the ability to keep notes on things that I have finished.  Unfortunately, if accessing it at any time takes more than a single keystroke, and would take me out of what I am doing, it seems like I probably would not use it.  At any time when I should update it, I will tend to choose to store the information in short term memory out of expediency.  The activation energy is just too high.<p>Has anybody found a technique for managing themselves that takes very little energy to integrate?

2072654,comment,2071816,2072582,0,0,mononcqc,,,"1. Error messages are sometimes cryptic and that is indeed a language flaw. Line numbers would be absolutely fantastic to have and it's a shame they're not there. I can agree on that. Other languages, however, do not uniformly do a better job at being clear when crashing. It's not a unique trait of Erlang to have unfriendly error messages.<p>2. Strings are important, but not the list type of strings all the time. Erlang, as I mention in the article, has 3 types of strings, and atoms. Jlouis' article had the best arguments for the strings not being that necessary (or rather, too depended upon in general circumstances). See PHP for an example of a language that depends on strings too much for everything.<p>This is also really dependent on the type of application you work with. Telecom software barely needed strings and rather needed ways to handle binary protocols. Some web apps will need them more than others. I might have painted them all with a brush too wide -- working with Erlang brings me to issues where strings are not needed that often and are frequently used as an opaque data type that you just pass on to some other piece of code somewhere else.<p>3. Yes, you need to create and maintain the chain of supervisors yourself. I am not aware of any AI system good enough to figure out what is alright to have crashing and what isn't, or how to react when problems arise, when to give up on restarting processes, etc.<p>I have my doubts about 'nothing stops you from having them in other languages'. I know Scheme with Thermite had them. What other languages have supervisors, monitors and links that can even work across nodes?<p>4. Refactoring is a valid point, and there are very interesting tools for that (see Wrangler: <a href=""http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/wrangler/Home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/wrangler/Home.html</a>),\n but there is more to refactoring than moving bits of code around: handling dependencies, breaking existing functionalities and regressions, etc. Syntax only makes one of all the problems of refactoring difficult. Referential transparency, success typings and all the other tools make it a lot easier. It's not all or nothing here.<p>5. It's fine that they might never will. Erlang isn't for everyone. I found it maps to my mental model of organizing things very well -- much better than any OO language out there. I can readily accept that for many people, the opposite is true.<p>6. Erlang is anything but academic at its roots. It was created in industrial setups by computer scientists and engineers with real problems to solve. It's been battle tested for decades and has received academic interest only afterwards and is now enjoying a presence both in the industry and in academia.",1294264106

First, if I add a track I do not get any feedback of it's addition when using the latest non-beta Firefox. Secondly, if I click a song from the ""Edit Playlist"" page it will always play the first one and not the one I clicked. Before you do any extensions test your app extensivly.

For example ""Das Racist - You Oughta Know"" does not show a cover but has the song. While when putting in an unknown German band it displayed the same icon.

If we run a study with threshold p=0.05, there is a 1 in 20 chance that we will erroneously report the claim to be true.<p>Now, let's say ten different scientists are interested in this claim, and they're all going to run their own experiments. The chance that all ten will run an experiment with each reporting ""false"" is under 60%.[0] <i>Over 40% of the time, at least one scientist will falsely conclude the existence of the phenomenon</i> that definitely does not exist. This is an effect of running multiple independently-considered experiments without aggregating the results.<p>That's the Bayesian problem that people mention.

The next time one has to use the reason engine one should work with the most recent prior. An alternative but equivalent way of stating the same is that one should look at the entire past to form the valid prior of that instant.<p>Lets take the example. There is a one to one correspondence with fictitious counts and priors. One way of encoding a 50:50 prior is to construct a possibly fictitious but representative past of (say) 2000 samples split into 1000 guilty and a 1000 not-guilty. After each prediction and assuming that the truth gets known one has to update the counts appropriately, so that the next time we use a different prior.<p>Our initial prior may be wrong but it will approach the correct one asymptotically.

Inside of all of that, he can discuss the issue from multiple angles and provide advice. There's depth: you take time to understand where the author is coming from. In return he provides you in-depth advice in the area you are interested in. More than that: good authors teach you how to <i>think</i> about solving problems in a particular area.<p>Instead of that format, on the net we have hit-and-run McDonalds sagacity. Questioners don't have time for a book. They have some random problem and Google is their friend. As a responder, I'm just some schmuck on the internet, busy doing other things and mostly distracted. I'm taking all of 30 seconds to guess what the person's problem might be, then fitting it all into some random mood and context I brought along with me. No matter how smart I am, it's just not the same. It's useful at times, no doubt, but it's not the same. I don't think the social networking paradigm translates over well to advice-giving. Heck, even with book authors I find that the quality varies quite a bit, and that's folks that take months to address an issue.<p>Again, I'm not saying these sites aren't valuable: I use them all the time. I just think we may put too much stock into the first returns from a Google or SO search. Trying to add structure to the process isn't going to necessarily make it better. If voting and friends work for sharing jokes and links, and they work for forming a community, it doesn't necessarily follow that they are the bedrock for creating a valuable structure to answer repeat questions. When we discuss this we might be like the guy who has a hammer and can do anything -- as long as all the problems are nails. (In other words we know the answer is going to be a tweet or a quick reply reused from a previous question, we just are trying to figure out how big of a hammer/format/magic we need to make it all work)",1294262359

Most people are satisficers (when the first idea pops up that could even remotely fix the problem they stop thinking about more solutions) and they tend to force that on others as well.

2072467,comment,2071816,2072374,0,0,mononcqc,,,"Bicycles have training wheels to get you going. Erlang doesn't. It might be hard and require effort.<p>I don't know how you learn new things, but it's generally taking me lots of effort: math, sports, music, etc. They're all hard when you first begin.<p>I remember I couldn't ever do anything good on a bass guitar (I started learning with a terrible sense of rhythm, not being able to clap on a 4/4 beat). I thought that music was just too hard, that the notation was too complex and obtuse for the sake of it, that improvising and jamming took some natural skill to get. It doesn't. All it takes is work, lots of it. It's hard because it's different and not something you pick up easily without prior experience. And even once I learned how to play bass (and have been for years now), I can't play drums for shit because it requires an entirely different way to think about music, notation and synchronism. You have to get in a different mindset when you switch instruments, or even just bands.<p>As for sports, mastery takes years. Of course someone in a good physical condition will pick up some of them with more ease than someone not used to many sports, but if you're a trained ice hockey player, the skillset you learn won't apply with the same ease for baseball or basketball when compared to roller hockey or field hockey. You have to go back to some basics. Re-learn how to position yourself, new strategies, discover muscles you hadn't trained before.<p>I see learning new programming languages as something somewhat related -- Languages can do their best to be friendly, but when the concepts behind them just vary wildly (see Prolog vs. C), you'll likely hit a wall. And it will not be the language's fault, but a question of you working hard enough to grasp it. Many languages have similar concepts and could be compared to switching from Bass Guitar to a cello, or from football to flag football. Python and Ruby have different syntaxes, but switching from one to the other is often a question of details. Even going back and forth with PHP is a similar thing. Going from Scheme to Common Lisp isn't as big of a leap as going from Prolog to C. I do believe Erlang (and many functional languages) fit this concept.<p>If you've never worked with them before, you'll be surprised by persistent data structures, the absence of O(1) arrays, message passing semantics, share-nothing ideas, lack of global data, an environment without main loops (or any kind of loops), different ways to handle exceptions, a specific way to package and write applications, lack of namespaces, new syntax, atoms, pattern matching, linked-lists as strings, bit syntax, etc. Of course the first contact will suck if many of these concepts are foreign -- you have to learn from scratch when you likely were very proficient in many other languages. You will be slow, your code might be slow, and everything will look unfriendly.<p>Obviously some languages are suffering from bad design, but knowing Erlang, I don't believe it's one of these. Hence my position on blaming lack of familiarity before syntax or any other reason. You have the right to disagree, but I would like to know your reasons for it if you do :)",1294261405

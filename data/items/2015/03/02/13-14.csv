9131828,comment,9131546,9131546,0,0,slgeorge,,,"As it says, \n  &quot;If there is one truism in the technology market, it is that premium pricing just doesn’t last.&quot;<p>It definitely has one aspect of a Truism [1] - no-one really looks at the underlying assumptions. The biggest assumption in much of the tech industry is that you&#x27;re aiming for mass market - the consumer tech brands like Facebook particularly have that assumption - other people follow sometimes without understanding the implications.<p>If that&#x27;s your focus, and you have limited differentiation your pricing has to reflect that over time replacements will come in and undercut you. That&#x27;s the GoPro example he&#x27;s using, where the parameters of his comparison are the &quot;components of the hardware camera&quot;.<p>What he&#x27;s missed is that Apple and plenty of others (think every car brand) have shown that brand and real differentiation can prevent new entrants from being able to provide an equivalent that is good enough. The point is that the customer has to believe that product A and product B are comparable - and that the parameters may not just be the bits or atoms.<p>For example GoPro&#x27;s brand speaks to &quot;action sports&quot; and being active, they have software and communities that people want to be in. It&#x27;s perceived as something that &#x27;active people&#x27; use and has brand cachet. So the &#x27;replacement&#x27; has to capture all that value, not just the hardware costs. Frankly, they&#x27;ve absolutely eaten the lunch of much bigger hardware companies who have far more economies of scale.<p>The AWS example is even less clear cut. Since Amazon is a retailer we can assume their strategy is mass take-up, and we know that their general pricing strategy is for people to &quot;believe&quot; they are cheapest. But, we also know that Amazon practises differentiation, we&#x27;ve seen that with Kindle and Amazon Prime. If you look at the AWS services you can see they are aiming to provide a highly differentiated service aside from &quot;simple&quot; IaaS. We also know that as a retailer Amazon uses extremely sophisticated pricing strategies. At this point I would think that Amazon is continuing to drive down the cost of basic IaaS due to economies of scale which makes it very difficult for competitors to get started, while keeping the cost up of &#x27;value-added&#x27; services which provide differentiated service and make the whole service a lot more sticky. They will probably do Amazon Prime like things with their whole portfolio over time.<p>There are plenty of businesses where the strategy of being cheapest is right, but it&#x27;s not the only approach.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truism</a>",1425304689

9131819,comment,9131546,9131546,0,0,krschultz,,,"I believe engineers over-rate the cost/feature-consciousness of consumers and under-rate brand consciousness.<p>People do want to shop on price, but they want a discount on the brand they know. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;ll buy a laptop for $20 less on Amazon than at Best Buy, but they probably won&#x27;t buy a non-name brand laptop.<p>I don&#x27;t even think his examples are compelling. There were action cameras before GoPro, there are alternative cameras on the market now. Some have different form factors, some are cheaper, some are better. At the end of the day, GoPro is plastered all over every action sport competition and their daily video email gets millions of views. That&#x27;s harder to replace than the actual tech - especially when the product itself needs to be redesigned every 18 months.<p>Also note that &quot;come in under the incumbent&#x27;s price&quot; is a bad startup strategy. The incumbent has economy of scale & bulk pricing advantages the startup can&#x27;t match. The only way to do it is to build a different product that is so much cheaper to make that you can squeeze the same margins in a lower price tier. If that&#x27;s possible, then it means GoPro has shot over what the market needs. In that particular case, I don&#x27;t think it is true today. It might be true someday.<p>In AWS&#x27;s case, I actually think the competitive play is on the higher end. Everyone is trying to undercut AWS&#x27;s price (generally by giving it away for free). I feel that the last 20 years has shown trying to get under Amazon or Walmat&#x27;s price is a bad strategy. How can anyone get under their price at smaller scale without taking a &quot;strategic&quot; loss or having 0 margins? I&#x27;d rather compete on the high side by offering better docs / UI & UX / support and not be competing completely on the price of hardware.",1425304588

Every two years brought a huge tangible improvement. Programs made for new computers just wouldn&#x27;t run on old PCs, or if they did would be unusably slow. That ended sometime around the release of the Core 2, except for niche users (gamers, developers, etc.)<p>It&#x27;s the same thing for phones right now. A phone that is more than a few years old just feels like a piece of crap to use; it&#x27;s slow, the screen is poor, and it doesn&#x27;t support new features. Good times for manufacturers! (Though we are very rapidly getting to the end of this cycle, IMHO).<p>Same thing applies to AWS, brought up as an example in the post. The base price is not really the issue -- AWS prices fall slower than Moore&#x27;s law and it is still more expensive that bare metal. It&#x27;s the new toys you get every year that make AWS attractive. AWS keeps providing more and more pieces of your infrastructure at attractive price points with less admin overhead. At some point they&#x27;ll have reimplemented everything the modern company needs and then they too will be subject to more serious competition.",1425304528

No doubt there will be people using it this way, though, and maybe there are cases where it really makes sense.<p>What JSONB makes much easier is storing data that are not a good fit for relational paradigm. For example if you don&#x27;t know the exact structure (e.g. if you don&#x27;t know what keys to expect), you can&#x27;t reasonably decompose that into relational schema.<p>This is the case with mail headers, for example - it&#x27;s highly variable, every client/MTA can define their own headers, and so on. You could decompose that into EAV model (yuck), use tables with generic PARAM_1, ..., PARAM_N columns (yuck!), or you can just stuff that into a JSONB column.",1425304517

In order to check-in, all the worker must do is to send this code as an SMS within this 30 second timeframe. Timesheets are generated automatically and are available instantaneously in the textin.io web dashboard.<p>Your job is to prospect, generate leads, engage potential customers, handle inbound leads and, most importantly, perform direct sales of:\n1) Textin platform subscription (monthly reoccurring payment)\n2) Clocker devices (one-time cost, shipped worldwide by DHL)<p>As sales, your commission will be the first 4 months of reoccurring payments from the deal you close sent to you monthly for 4 months after each payment from the client.<p>The end-price of a single Clocker device to the client is ~10$ (depending on amount). Shipping is included. We sell them at cost or loss.<p>The platform subscription starts at $5 per worker (discounts available). So netting a company that tracks 100 workers nets you $2000 during 4 month period (5<i>100</i>4=2000).<p>Our clients are in Construction, Cleaning, Delivery, Hospitality, Real estate, Telecommunications, Transportation, Travel &Tourism.<p>The main pain-point Textin addresses is temporary or outsourced workers, as it requires no additional equipment or training. The worker must use their own phone, and simply text (send as SMS) a 6-digit number they see with their own eyes to a number.

The current method of manually moving a max of 500 at a time into other albums is a non-starter, especially if you had set auto-backup to also backup other local image folders from your mobile devices (Whatsapp/Telegram, photo editors, etc).<p>The client is waaaaaaay too heavy.  G+ is unusable on a Chromebook if you have Gmail and more than one or two other tabs open.<p>The half-assed merging of Picasa web albums into G+ was aggressively user-unfriendly.  There are a lot of us who still use the quite excellent Picasa desktop app for light photo editing and album management.  The G+ album viewer/browser is horrifically bad.<p>Photo commenting is pretty much broken.  You can comment, but it&#x27;s pretty antisocial, unlike imgur/instagram/facebook.<p>A lot of content houses & brands don&#x27;t publish to G+, or if they do, it&#x27;s half-assed secondary crap that seems to just be bots posting links.  Very few seem to interact with the G+ community.<p>The Hangouts integration is heavy & crappy compared to the nice and light fb chat integration, and almost no one seems to know about video chat, much less the ability to (in some countries) dial phones via Hangouts.<p>The idea of Communities is a good one, but it operates as sort of the opposite of Usenet.  If someone leaves a community or deletes their account (granted, this may be a bigger problem for Google Apps for Work customers) all their content goes with them.<p>As other commenters have noted, G+ seems to have been created with the mission statement of being everything to everyone, but in the process it has alienated many and broken a lot.  I suggest focusing on fixing the discrete parts and only then deciding whether it makes sense to integrate them.<p>I, for one, am thankful to at least be able to use my Google/G+ credentials to login to a bunch of common sites now, so it has that going for it.",1425303974
9131782,comment,9130138,9131001,0,0,glesica,,,"> I&#x27;m still convinced that the power of facebook is there is one url for everything an everyday person needs from the internet. People want one website that has everything.<p>I strongly disagree. Take SourceForge as an example. A compelling case can be made that part of the reason it died is that it tried to do everything all in once place. On the other hand, when companies like Github popped up, they did code hosting, and they did it really well. Sure they later added stuff like wikis and web sites, but Github is still 99% focused on hosting and interacting with code.<p>Another example is AOL. A big part of the reason the web won out over AOL is that people had choice. You could get your email from Yahoo! (back in the day their email service was excellent), your news from CNN, host your web site on Angelfire, and use Lycos for search. Sure, you might get benefits from using two services that were owned by the same company (I personally use Blogger because it makes it so easy to pull in pictures from G+ which are synced from my phone), but you could use them in isolation just as easily.<p>Even Facebook is splitting their app into discrete apps on mobile (<a href=""http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/12/30/facebook-will-continue-efforts-to-move-away-from-one-single-app-on-ios/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/12/30/facebook-will-contin...</a>). Maybe they&#x27;re just idiots, but it seems like the smart money is that they know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>Another example is Google Drive. They tried to integrate Google Docs into Drive and call the whole thing &quot;Google Drive&quot;. Why would my file syncing service have an office suite? That makes no sense! I want my file syncing service to <i>work</i> with documents created by my office suite, by I don&#x27;t want them to be the same product. It was a nightmare, now they&#x27;ve split them back out.<p>And a final example. What you&#x27;re talking about is basically the concept of a &quot;portal&quot; from the late 90s. It was tried, Yahoo! bet big on it. Google won with its white page and a single text field. People wanted a search engine that rocked, they didn&#x27;t really care about having a unified experience. The web is messy, that&#x27;s what makes it powerful! Google had its own portal for awhile, it wasn&#x27;t all that popular so they dropped it.<p>People want products that work together at the points where it makes sense for them to work together, but they don&#x27;t want a single product that does everything under the sun, because that makes it annoying to use just one of them (even if you use them all you only use one at a time).",1425303971

These sorts of headlines bug me, in that they reject computation itself as a novel medium of expression or externalizations of mental models.<p>I think modeling is very important, but Chris seems confused on how to reason about education.  The core message, that we want children with higher levels of cognition than mere factual knowledge, is good, but rather obvious.    His core conclusion that we don&#x27;t want a generation of people caring about code has nothing to do with this, and is very misguided.  This basically rejects computation as an expressive medium outright in favor of the usual writing and mathematics (&quot;writers and accountants&quot;), rather than recognizing computation&#x27;s new role in society and new jobs that leverage it (business analyst with his Excel macros, quantitative analyst or data scientist with his combination of statistics and scripting, software engineers, test engineers, architects).<p>It&#x27;s almost like Chris took \nBloom&#x27;s taxonomy (not actually a taxonomy, but useful) <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom&#x27;s_taxonomy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom&#x27;s_taxonomy</a> of cognition and decided that the foundational element - knowledge - basic reading, writing, coding, math, and facts - is irrelevant.  This is not irrelevant, it is the foundation on which we build comprehension, then application, then analysis,  synthesis, and evaluation.  This he calls specification, exploration, validation, and debugging.  Good luck teaching someone how to apply a model, let along synthesize one, when they can&#x27;t do the basics of expression.  This gets into the philosophy of education, and perhaps this article is just a reflection of the current trend away from rote learning, but this is an active debate, not settled science.  This trend may lead to some bizarre outcomes: I see 15 year olds that can&#x27;t read a wall clock or understand basic techniques around fractions, though they can describe and do basic reasoning about them.<p>Secondly, I believe coding itself is a fundamentally new area of knowledge, and every debate about &quot;coding is the new literacy&quot; really comes down to whether you believe this or reject it.  Rather than convince you, all I can do is quote from the preface of SICP <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html</a>, one of the great examples of computing pedagogy we have:<p>&#x27;Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that &quot;computer science&quot; is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology ­ the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of &quot;what is.&quot; Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of &quot;how to.&quot;&#x27;<p>Yes, modeling is important - it&#x27;s a a higher level of cognitive reasoning.

It&#x27;s a learned mapping (using any method you want, such as neural networks) from agent history (i.e. the agent is allowed to consider the past) & action pairs, to estimates of future reward, learned through temporal differences between the prediction at time step t, and the sum of new prediction plus immediate reward at time step t+1.<p>In this way, information can flow back in time as the agent learns that some observation is predictive of reward, and then learns some observation is predictive of that observation, and so on until it connects the reward with some action K time steps ago. So long-term planning is definitely possible.<p>This does require that some relevant information be available at each intermediate time step to connect the actions with the ultimate reward. The nice thing about these Atari games is you can usually judge value just by what&#x27;s immediately on the screen, and in this paper they only use the last three frames&#x27; worth of state. In a game requiring a memory for past sensory information (e.g. where information appears on the screen then disappears), this might not do so well, but that&#x27;s more a matter of working memory than long-term planning, and a different Q-learning system could contain a working memory (e.g. if it was RNN-based).",1425303140

All the fake violence I saw as a child on TV desensitized me to the real violence I now see in the news.<p>I&#x27;m not even disturbed by beheading videos or actual raw footage of violent murders (i.e. whatever&#x27;s new on LiveLeak this month). I don&#x27;t seek them out directly or find them entertaining. I just don&#x27;t have any more visceral reactions than to a video of a guy getting kicked in the groin.<p>I think some part of what my parents taught me about TV got lodged in the wrong part of my brain: &quot;What you see on TV isn&#x27;t real, it&#x27;s just make believe.&quot; I do have very strong (and natural) reactions when seeing violence or cruelty in person. I just barely react to seeing these things on tape (beyond the ick factor). Except for (real) violence against animals, that is.<p>It&#x27;s actually pretty gruelling what&#x27;s considered acceptable to show on the 8 o&#x27;clock news these days. But I&#x27;m not sure whether this is a cultural thing again -- I hear American news channels have a policy of never showing dead US soldiers.",1425301324

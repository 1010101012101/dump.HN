Perhaps you know more than I do, but Android ""not allowing apks to be sent over Bluetooth"" seems pretty unlikely to me.<p>It doesn't allow you to easily get <i>at</i> apks you've downloaded from the Play store, if that's what you mean, but I think that's just an anti-piracy measure.  An apk you've downloaded from somewhere else is, as far as I can tell, just another file.

Visa and MasterCard rates are already almost identical, and American Express will continue getting away with higher fees because of the higher net worth and spending power of its customer base.<p>I sell business services and most of my credit customers pay with Amex cards. They typically have higher credit approval barriers and annual fees, which their customers gladly pay for the raft of benefits the other issuers don't offer (extended warranties on all purchases, accidental damage coverage, rental insurance, travel insurance, roadside assistance, etc). Price is not the only dimension a card issuer can compete on.<p>Further, aside from Amex and Discover, the card issuers have no control over merchant fees.

(I.e. if people in your town don't know about meetup.com, then it doesn't matter and you can get away with a website and marketing it another way [try reaching out to Python/Perl/Web Design groups and see if anyone would be interested in meeting up to talk or learn Ruby]).<p>If you'll be meeting with a bunch of people who are new to Ruby, going through RubyMonk.com together can be a good way to get people up to speed.

A lot of people talk as if they're being threatened by this; it's reminiscent of listening to people talk about how marriage is under siege. I'd love to see a language analysis comparing the two, actually, for a more objective perspective.<p>I mean... how much of this debate is driven by an unconscious thought along these lines: ""I still use Facebook, even though everyone agrees it's evil. I feel bad about that, but I don't want to leave my friends there. We <i>could</i> move to G+ or something, but it'd be hard to get everyone to go.""",1359229587
5121479,comment,5118554,5121328,4,0,mpyne,,,"> I'm not that familiar with the US Justice process, and nothing in that sentence makes sense to me :-/<p>Basically in the U.S. justice system you have a right to trial by jury, but this is expensive for both sides, takes a lot of time (both for the prosecution and defense, but also for the jury itself), so typically both sides will engage in a process of plea bargaining.<p>This is where the prosecution gives up on some things (such as their recommended sentence) in order to convince the defense not to pursue the trial by jury. Depending on the evidence involved (which hasn't been thrown out by the judge at this point) it may even be advantageous for the <i>defense</i> to pursue a plea bargain to try to get a reduced sentence on what looks to be an almost certain conviction. In this case there was an offer by the prosecution for a 6-8 month prison sentence plea bargain.<p>However, if the prosecution really wants to avoid a jury trial then generally they'll argue for a longer-than-normal sentence should they win a conviction (because otherwise the defense would simply always settle for jury trial and hope for a ""Hail Mary"" that overturns the case on a technicality). So the prosecution had announced that they would argue for a sentence of 6-7 years (or so) should the trial go to a jury phase and convict Swartz.<p>The ""fair sentence"" is independent of what the defense and prosecution think, and is determined by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. It is based on these guidelines that Jennifer Granick estimated a sentence of 1-2 years, if convicted.<p>In any event the actual sentence is determined by a judge, usually based on the sentencing guidelines (1-2 years) and biased up or down based on how convinced the judge is of the arguments presented by the prosecution and defense. It's hard to say exactly what the judge would do, it really just depends on the judge.<p>As far as I know about Aaron, he wanted to plea bargain, but didn't want to plead to any charges that would make him a felon (but unfortunately the CFAA legal code is all ""felonies"" due to the way their maximum sentence is derived based on damages caused).<p>> By ""trumped up loss"", do you mean that the prosecution exaggerated the loss of the MIT/JSTOR?<p>It never got to that point, but basically the CFAA allows the victim to claim any costs that are reasonably associated with the crime committed by the suspect as damages. It's very open-ended, so you can claim damages even for functions you might ordinarily have been doing anyways.<p>For example, if MIT has 3 network techs looking into the network intrustion then their wages could be claims as damages, even if MIT would have had those 3 on work that day anyways. JSTOR shut off MIT's access for a few days while trying to block Swartz so MIT can not only claim the pro-rated value of their JSTOR contract for the time it was down, but they can also claim damages for all of their scientists and researchers who were delayed or otherwise affected by the loss of JSTOR services, even if it really could have waited a few days.<p>So that's what I mean by ""trumped-up"", the CFAA gives a very large book you can throw at the accused.<p>> At last, why is the 6-8 months plea bargain offer the worse? I thought it was the best one offered...<p>Way earlier in the case there had been a plea offer on the table that would have involved no jail time, but allegedly MIT did not buy off on that (this is kind of older data though I haven't seen anything refuting that).<p>At the time Aaron killed himself there was apparently two different pleas, one where the prosecution would ask for 8 months but the defense could argue to convince the judge to reduce it, and another where the sentence was more ""dialed-in"". It escapes me what the differences between the two would have been in practice though, I'm not familiar enough with the private discussions (at least until those details get leaked out too)",1359229586

I would guess most language/compiler hackers would rather hack on something other than the mess that is C++ compilation, if they have a choice (and if they're volunteers, they do have a choice). So it ultimately boils down to what companies want to do, since many enterprises are heavily invested in C++. If someone pays their employees to contribute support for GCC, it'll get done, and otherwise, it's less likely. Not that much different from the Clang situation, where C++11 is only really getting implemented because Apple cares enough about getting C++11 support into XCode to pay for it to happen.",1359228496

I just know that:<p>a) If a song is published (and BGB was) then anyone has the right to cover it (a compulsory license always exists)<p>b) If someone covers it, the covering artist gets no copyright of the musical material - all that is retained by the song copyright owner(s).  (This makes intuitive sense, as it otherwise would restrict the ability of other artists to create more covers of the song.  You'd have to make sure that your arrangement choices didn't conflict with ANY other arrangements out there.)<p>c) The covering artist does have copyright over the <i>sound recording</i> of the arrangement.<p>Now, if techie people wanted to get involved in a way they could actually affect things, rather than just theorizing about what someone's actions/motivations might have been, there's opportunity here:<p>Coulton released a karaoke track of his version of BGB.  It's released by-nc-sa.  It's considered likely that Fox used this karaoke track as the backing track for their version.  If so, they have infringed on all three portions of the license (no attribution, they're selling it, they didn't release it share-alike).<p>So - I don't know how to do this, but it seems like someone could do a statistical analysis of the karaoke track, and Fox's version, and prove within some statistical likeliness that Fox used the karaoke track and did not simply re-record their own instruments.  (Note that it WOULD be legal for Fox to re-record Coulton's arrangement note-for-note since it would no longer be using Coulton's sound recording.)",1359228413

Each of these families then also has sub-groupings based on release date/capabilities, like the 20xx series, 22xx series, etc. So the 2040 is their lowest-end filer they still sell (and that supports the latest OS version), while the 2240 is the newer build designed to replace the 2040 (better CPUs, RAM, etc).<p>The 2xxx series (2040 (older, but available), 2220, 2240) are all lower-end and have limited expansion capabilities, as well as including disks in the controller chassis. The 2240 is unique in that it can support a single 10Gb ethernet card or an 8Gb FC card (but not both at the same time), while the rest of the 2xxx family can't.<p>The 3xxx series (3140 (older), 3220, 3250) are mid-range filers with decent expansion options (SSD/Flash PCIe card, 10Gb ethernet, 8Gb fiber channel, more SAS ports, etc).<p>The 6xxx series (6040, 6080, with the 62xx series coming soon) are high-end filers with tons of expansion ports and built-in ports to handle larger workloads and higher total storage limits.<p>The v-series is designed to be a front-end to another SAN, giving you the NetApp suite of software/capabilities without rebuying all of that disk.<p>There's also the E-series, which is the Engenio tech they're selling after acquiring them a year or two ago.

Most take a kind of ""field of dreams"" approach and at best confirm that they're doing more good than harm and leave it at that, rather than heavily crunch into how much good it's doing or isn't doing, how well it works compared to other approaches, what could be learned and applied to future efforts including area differences, and so forth. That's terrible - just because something is better than nothing is no excuse to not attempt to optimize it. Yet it never seems to happen outside of medicine (a field used to living and dying on it's data) and even then often taking a rather naive approach and considering improvements in cases rather than a more bulk-medicine approach similar to military medicine (people are dying constantly at a high rate, so the problem isn't so much how well an individual treatment works as how well a treatment, applied shotgun over a group, works considering it's cost).",1359227253

It's a constant struggle and what you see just might be a somewhat stable state.

Plenty of other species go extinct all the time. That's nature.<p>Anyways, I'm not saying it's fine to kill elephants at all. Indeed, I find it disgusting, and it'd be fantastic if societies could figure out ways to ensure that poaching isn't a beneficial action.

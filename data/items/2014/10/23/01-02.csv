The quality of the hires are still pretty good, but definitely not what they were 5 years ago.  The engineering culture is still strong and permeates the entire organization, but the company is so large that less and less flexibility is allowed in each team&#x27;s process.  Thus, engineers (especially those at the lowest levels, like right out of school) aren&#x27;t exposed to as much interesting work; many will find in 2-3 years that they have career opportunities at Google and companies of similar size but few opportunities at more interesting companies that are looking for someone with a few years experience with newer technologies.  Technologies that Google doesn&#x27;t use.  Processes that Googlers don&#x27;t know because they work in the confines of a huge corporation.<p>Still not a bad place to be &#x27;cause Google pays well and they&#x27;re comfortable.

When that happens, it can make newer companies become dominant.<p>For example, if Facebook-Apple comes out with an Oculus-or-wrist-wearable-augmented-reality-gadget, a user could be standing on a street corner and see a car pass by that he doesn&#x27;t recognize.  He then sends a voice command to his wearable to ask what the model is and it creates ads of dealers that sell it.  The &quot;search engine&quot; behind the scenes could be Bing or whatever Facebook-Apple licenses.<p>The ads are still there.  Searches (of some type) are still there.  But the contextual triggers have changed.  There are no business guarantees that google.com will remain in the pipeline of future (lucrative) ad triggers.<p>My example above may also be convoluted but I&#x27;m sure others could imagine a future where the <i>majority</i> of searches come from another mechanism besides typing words into a little box on a webpage.  Ad rates from google would nosedive because advertisers would pay a premium for Oculus ads instead of google.com ads.  I think those are the scenarios that would &quot;eclipse&quot; google.com.<p>This has happened before with newspapers. The car industry grew but newspapers ad rates for cars and car dealers have declined.  A lot of those ad dollars shifted to television and google.  Newspapers declined even though they <i>still</i> run ads for cars today.",1414029162

It&#x27;s easy to hire extra employees to pick up slack or for employees to get away with wasting large amounts of time or being semi-competent. If customers buy your service once and never come back who cares if there are beating a path to your door? There will always be more so you&#x27;ll stay in the black. The atmosphere can be really relaxed and fun and casual. Lots of different ideas can be tried in a &quot;throw spaghetti on the wall and see what sticks&quot; manner. It doesn&#x27;t really matter if you fail, things are going really well!<p>The problem is what happens when the market starts to cool down. The perks suddenly disappear in the raises stop happening. Manual processes that wasted a lot of employee time or cost extra people to have to be hired suddenly get cleaned up and people find themselves working overtime or without jobs. When the executive start seeing the money disappear the feeling inside the place changes completely. You better not make any mistakes or trying waste money with a new idea. Best to stick with what used to work; that must&#x27;ve been correct. Wasting money is the last thing you need.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t really matter if the employees were doing their best job and weren&#x27;t slacking off or wasting resources and all. Even if they are model employees the business model may have been unsustainable (like pets.com) and never would&#x27;ve succeeded even if everything had been run perfectly. $300/customer acquisition cost doesn&#x27;t work well when the average customer ends buys $25/year in products.<p>If you knew all this was going on, employees could get out near the top or skip the ride altogether and work in a company that&#x27;s solid building up their reputation there. Instead they might get laid off or have to leave under desperate circumstances and might have to find another job on the quick.<p>All because a change in the market revealed that there was a company that never should&#x27;ve been successful in the first place and may have only grown through an accident of luck.",1414028168

They&#x27;re typically thin wire (0.4 or 0.64mm gauge) designed for a voice signal with a bandwidth in the kHz ranges, and then these DSL technologies use tens to hundreds of MHz, which works to some extent over shorter distances but the higher frequency you go, the more quickly attenuate over longer distances.<p>Then you have electromagnetic interference between different subscriber&#x27;s lines, which can make a huge dent in performance (literally as high as 40-50%). Vectoring is a technology that tries to model the noise and send signals to cancel it out to reduce this. It&#x27;s fairly effective, but not completely.<p>What you get is the requirement to basically have a node, fed with fibre and electricity (unless they&#x27;re back-powered from houses, which was suggested for G.fast) that only services a dozen or so houses. With the cost of the capital works required, it&#x27;s debatable whether it&#x27;s not worth spending the ~$800-$1200 per house (this is actuals from the Australian NBN rollout) to just complete the fibre all the way, which could then in the future be upgraded to 10Gbit without any capital works (just swapping the terminating hardware in the exchange and at the customer premises - no requirement to touch any of the cabling).",1414027601

It was kind of neat, but even still - we were making a glorified movie list, which is not a problem anyone actually has.<p>At the time, our biggest &#x27;competitor&#x27; (in our eyes) was jinni.com, which still seems to be doing something similar to what they set out to do way back then.<p>It&#x27;s 2014 now, and I still see about 1-3 of these types of sites pop up every year. I just met a guy who has a similar movie list app out in Berkeley last week - no joke.<p>So, does your product suck? Maybe not. Is it a product solving a real problem that people will pay for? I don&#x27;t think so. I personally don&#x27;t see any value in using this site over Netflix, and I&#x27;m sure a lot of others would agree with me.<p>But it is okay if no one likes it - you can get a lot out of making something without it being successful or ultimately useful. I learned a lot working at that movie startup, and I am glad I did it, even though the damn thing fell apart before we could generate revenue. Revel in it, pal!

Verizon was the DSL provider, and the best they could give me was 1.5Mbps. I went with cable.<p>At my new place, I have the choice between cable and fiber. Verizon is the fiber provider, and they&#x27;ll happily sell me up to 500Mbps if I want to pay for it, and they deliver. That&#x27;s symmetrical, too, as of a couple of months ago.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of big ISPs, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as bad as you say either.",1414026195

What is it about the modern environment that makes people so much more reluctant to pick up and move?  With all the benefits of modern communication and technology that makes maintaining social connections over distances and receiving financial support from anywhere so easy, you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be <i>easier</i> to move than before when leaving really meant &quot;leaving.&quot;",1414026144

They had a fresh slate to get things right, and instead they end up making it worse than the SIP headache. SDP, the spec that suggests people might use SDP to setup <i>chess</i> games is a terrible format. In fact, unless they changed the offer answer model, there&#x27;s actually no way to determine what single codec is in use. It&#x27;s one of those things where every vendor sorta does something, and relies on tons of interop and guessing to actually come up with an implementation. Plus it&#x27;s yet another custom parser with a strange format. And deliberately clipped in verbosity (for a text format) because the SIP authors were terrified of IP fragmentation and actually <i>spec&#x27;d</i> a hardcoded MTU size.<p>Edit: Frustration aside, this is a really nice explanation, thanks.",1414026107

8496170,comment,8495673,8495673,0,0,tzs,,,"The NCAA is basically a joke when it comes to enforcing their rules on academic standards. This was made clear a couple years ago, when they hit Caltech with big penalties for lax academic standards, while basically ignoring things like the UNC scandal.<p>Caltech was fact was technically in violation, because it allows students to spend the first three weeks of each term taking classes without registering for them. The idea is that students can sample several classes they are interested in, then decide which they will stick with, and then register. For this three weeks, they are doing the work from all of the classes they are sampling.<p>However, since they are not registered for a full academic load during that three weeks, they count as part-time students, not full-time students, and so are ineligible for NCAA sports. Caltech&#x27;s new director of athletics noticed this, stopped the violations, and reported his department to the NCAA.<p>The reaction of the press, both general and sports (Google &quot;NCAA caltech&quot; for details), was generally to make fun of the NCAA, and point out all the serious athletic schools routinely committing much worse, much more intentional violations.<p>Of course, some of the major sanctions won&#x27;t have any effect. For instance, Caltech was banned from postseason play for one year. Considering that most Caltech teams are in the midst of years or even decades long losing streaks in conference play, they aren&#x27;t going near the postseason anyway. They also banned off-campus recruiting...which Caltech doesn&#x27;t do.<p>The only sanction that might have actually been noticeable was wiping out all wins of the ineligible teams. There was some initial concern that this would wipe out the basketball win over Occidental earlier that year that had snapped a 26 year, 310 conference game losing streak [1]. It turned out all the players on that team had been eligible, so the win stands.<p>[1] A movie was made about this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Hoops"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Hoops</a>",1414026051

They&#x27;re forced to choose a major, often funneled into the easiest thing just to get through.<p>Fundamentally, the majority are in college to learn and prepare for life as a professional athlete (assuming we&#x27;re talking about the &quot;Big 3&quot; sports).  Let&#x27;s allow them to do that.  Let&#x27;s provide programs that focus on that, that teach sport fundamentals, dealing with the media, managing money, dealing with agents, fundamentals of business, etc.  Let&#x27;s also provide routes for post-professional-sport life, like lower-level media classes, etc.<p>We seem to have an aversion to treating a lucrative and very real profession like something that warrants education.<p>Edit: The problem with $ and athletes largely applies solely to football, wherein the NCAA and NFL have colluded to force high school talent to play <i>somewhere</i> for three years after graduation.  This is arbitrary and stupid, and forces kids into programs they don&#x27;t care about, for institutions that they don&#x27;t care about.  This is the primary issue with not paying players.  It&#x27;s not that colleges don&#x27;t pay, it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s <i>no other opportunity</i> to get paid.",1414026011

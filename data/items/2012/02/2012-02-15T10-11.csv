Gees.<p>Sure when I first started JavaScript it bit me exactly once. Since then, I got use to it. It's a different language, every language has its quirks. I'm sure if you started with JavaScript the fact that many other languages DON'T have block scope might upset you. You know what else doesn't have block scope? PYTHON!<p><pre><code>    def foo():
      if True:
        x = 123
      print x
</code></pre>
prints 123.  In C, Java, C++ you'd get an error that x doesn't exist.<p><pre><code>    void foo() {
      if (true)
        int x = 123
      printf(""%d\n"", x);

</code></pre>
4 meanings of this?<p>The fact is it gives you huge flexibility. By default, lots of libraries add names to the global object (for browsers that's 'window') but because you can control 'this' for all functions you can force any library to install itself to some other object.<p>Can you do that in C, C++ or Java?  As far as I know the only way to fix that in those languages is to edit a bazillion source files and change namespaces of you're lucky enough to have them.<p>Truthiness?<p>Again it's just different not broken. Lots of dynamic languages have strange kinds of conversions. Learn them and get over it. The only people this messes up are people expecting it to behave like Java or C/C++. It's not Java or C++.

The body shop mentality was just a result of market forces, and yeah culture probably played a role, but this situation is not providing great ROI for international clients.  The nature of programming is to automate drudgery, and Indian living standards are going up all the time, so the economics of this just weren't sustainable.  What is happening and will continue to happen is that Indian firms will grow into higher and higher market segments while this body shop stuff plateaus and then starts to decrease.  Increasingly Indian firms will find that the real money is serving their local markets which are HUGE, and which they have cultural knowledge to produce a superior product.  Initially this is done by copying successful products from innovation leaders worldwide, but eventually the competitive advantage will come from targeting the differences of the local population.  I believe this will happen regardless of culture, but I do feel bad for people who were sold on the idea that being an unthinking code monkey would provide a secure and lucrative long-term career.",1329300758

I remember writing a breakout game where the start button was the paddle. The code itself was very simple as it was basic Win32 APIs. As messy as those APIs were, they're lack of basic security made it great fun to write all sorts of weird hacks hehehe.<p>In fact, going back to the topic of MDIs (as the article referenced in relation to the WS_SYSMENU style), I wrote a basic program that would work as a winword 95 / 97 plug in (winword being an MDI back then) that would dump iexplore into winword so it would behave exactly like any other word document. This was done purely to get away with surfing the net in college as it was easier to hide your browser session behind a word document that it was to close/reopen it every time a lecturer walked past. IIRC that was just one API call (something like SetHwndParent?), but that was /years/ ago now and I've since left Windows development for Linux and Unix.<p></nostalgia>",1329300281

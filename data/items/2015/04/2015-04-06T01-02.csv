Both approaches have their advantages when proposing on projects.<p>The advantages of hourly pricing is that it clarifies that the client is paying for services not products. This is particularly useful when dealing with amateurs and anyone else with a &quot;consumer mindset.&quot; It is also useful because on projects where the value I provide comes in discreet chunks - some preliminary design sketches have value that is different from a specifications manual is different from a report is different from comprehensive construction documents is different from reviewing contractor bids.<p>Hourly proposals are also easy for me to write...indeed I can quote my rate and get people who really should be off the phone off the phone quickly.<p>Fixed fee proposals are better when the potential client already has established some value for the work...i.e. the sales lead is a professional running a business and even if it is their first time at this rodeo, they&#x27;ve been to others that are similar. Fixed fee pricing works well when the potential client knows the sort of value I can provide already and has realistic expectations of their project.<p>The key to profitable pricing is not to buy jobs. Set your rate or come up with a price that&#x27;s profitable and if the person writes the retainer great and if they don&#x27;t you have to be ok with walking away from a job that doesn&#x27;t match your requirements.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;d consider thinking about projects as services rather than products. Products imply something bought that is complete and can be returned if the customer isn&#x27;t happy. Services are paid for as they are performed.<p>Good luck.",1428285510

I would say that the author was wrong and this is a good example of a bad prediction. I mean, did you read the line about floppy disks?

I usually buy a upper mid-range to lower high end PC (currently running Core I7 5820K, 980) but i actually very rare upgrade them. The ones I buy last me for the 2-3 years of which ever games i play at the time, when i can no longer play them at the graphical level i deem acceptable i buy a new one.<p>And this is because the upgradeability of most PC&#x27;s is sort of a myth, if you buy a hardware which is all of the same range when you&#x27;ll have to upgrade a component the rest will become a bottle neck.<p>And i don&#x27;t see this being any different, the added cost of the router and the entire protocol simply writes off the benefits considering that an upgrade will require you to upgrade at least 3 major parts.<p>On top of that you run the risk of the &quot;router&quot; most likely be turned incompatible within a few years simply because the standard will evolve to allow for additional bandwidth, different power requirements, an improved form factor etc.<p>Take a look at PCI express for example from version 1 to 4 there were huge changes in bandwidth and power supply, and while some hardware kept backwards compatibility it was in most cases severely hindered by the bandwidth limitations. Put in a modern PCIE 3/4 graphics card in a PCI 1 or even 2 slot and you&#x27;ll see the difference high end cards lose upto 75% of their performance, some wont work at all due to the power supply differences.<p>Do you really think that for some reason that protocol would be exempt of that?<p>We already have a combined creativity of a multi-vendor environment, open your phone it has components from a 100 vendors. There are memory vendors, SOC vendors, sensor vendors, radio vendors, screen cameras etc.
You can have an LG phone with a top of the line Sony camera, and NVIDIA SOC and a Samsung memory in it, do you really need to add a plastic square that says Dr Dre to it?<p>Not to mention that at least now you have the ability to debug issues with fair ease, if the PC over the past 40 years have not managed to tackle cross vendor compatibility even at a hardware level (just check the accepted hardware list for your mother board for example) not to mention on the software level what makes you so sure that this all of a sudden will?<p>I would rather much see an easy way to connect peripheral discrete devices to my phone with ease for the extremely rare occasion i would (and atm i can&#x27;t think of one) need it than to have to select different hardware for my phone hoping it will all work together than having 6 different vendors to get support and claim warranty from while hoping that at least 2 or 3 of my lovely blocks will be compatible with the next years model.",1428285224

9326054,comment,9325637,9325637,0,0,visakanv,,,"It&#x27;s always interesting to look at old predictions– there was that Newsweek article that predicted the Internet was never going to be a big deal [1] (amusing because now Newsweek is online-only), and there were all the negative comments on the launch of the iPhone. [2] Also I believe Drew Houston&#x27;s &quot;Show HN: Dropbox&quot; thread has a famous &quot;Why would anybody need this, I can do the same with <complicated procedure>&quot; [3].<p>It&#x27;s tempting to think, &quot;Ah, people! So terrible at predicting things.&quot; I think it&#x27;s interesting to think about why that is.<p>The main problem, I think, isn&#x27;t that people make wrong predictions altogether. It&#x27;s that it&#x27;s very hard to see how things will change and evolve over time, and how the ecosystem will change with it. The &quot;One Laptop Per Child&quot; idea [4] sounds a little dated and silly now.<p>I suppose if we just remember that progress is continuous rather than discrete, and that a lot of seeming limitations can be overcome with currently-unlikely innovations, then a lot of predictions will be forced to be a lot more precise.<p>Perhaps the Newsweek prediction might&#x27;ve been amended to, &quot;In its present form, the Internet is unlikely to change the world.&quot;<p>The problem with predictions is– things rarely stay in their present forms, and the world around them rarely stays the same, either.<p>I think pg addresses this in his most recent essay, &quot;What Microsoft is this the Altair Basic of?&quot; [5] In his words– &quot;they practically all seemed lame at first.&quot;<p>So we have to learn to live in a world where our initially valid assessments of a thing might become rapidly invalid because of change. And this is where Nassim Taleb&#x27;s work about the problem of prediction [6] comes into play. Rather than trying to predict a particular outcome, it makes much more sense to focus on evaluating robustness and antifragility– &quot;How will this thing respond to change? What are the potential upsides, what are the potential downsides? What will kill it? What will give it more utility?&quot;<p>Even if the odds are really low that something might come around, if the payoff is high enough, it might be worth betting on. I think that&#x27;s the whole point of things like YC.<p>___<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/clifford-stoll-why-web-wont-be-nirvana-185306"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/clifford-stoll-why-web-wont-be-nirva...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20070116071424/http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/the-apple-iphone/#comments"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20070116071424/http://www.engadg...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/altair.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/altair.html</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incer...</a>",1428285090

9326052,comment,9325223,9326010,0,0,ufo,,,"There are many reasons for why life would only have appeared once on earth.<p>Firstly, the current environment is radically different from the conditions in early earth:<p>* Atmosphere composition has changed a lot, and largely due to the presence of life (more oxygen, no more ammonia, etc).<p>* In early earth it would be possible for complex organic compounds to accumulate in the environment. Nowadays, those would be rapidly consumed by life forms.<p>There is also a matter of competition:<p>* Almost every ecological niche on earth is already occupied by life and there is  very little space left for alternate life forms to evolve into.<p>* Current life forms compete against each other and that competition might also affect other nascent life forms. For example, one of the leading theory on the origin of life predicts that early life was largely RNA-based but nowadays lots of the planet is coated in RNA-digesting enzymes that organisms excrete as a form of protection against viruses. In fact, scientists working with RNA have to be very careful to avoid having their RNA be degraded by environmental enzymes.",1428285064

Yes artists were screwed on sales, but they were getting a lot of money before hand with juicy contracts. On a 10$ CD sale they used to win around 1$. The rest was made with touring ... So unlike today artists were getting a lot of money upfront. Anyway there were still getting 1/10 on each sale, compared to the pennies they get with Spotify...<p>A way to bypass labels hey? but running a label is a full time job. It&#x27;s like saying, why don&#x27;t artists do their own promo? why don&#x27;t they do all their own design, videoclip, PR ,manage sells on digital plateforms, send DMCA takedown requests to thousands of websites, and design and sell tshirts/merchandize on their own ?... well you can&#x27;t really make music, shows, be on the road,and manage all these things at once.<p>Sure,if you&#x27;re JayZ,you can own your own label, your own plateform, and a whole team dedicated to all these stuff, but all artists aren&#x27;t JayZ<p>Labels used to be &quot;banks&quot; for artists ,no more, no less. Try to bypass banking and see what happens.<p>Yet I&#x27;m optimistic.Things always evolve in an unexpected way.

3. The conversation is hijacked by discussing the offer and terms rather than the position. This is not productive, and the candidate has all the leverage. May or may not end with an agreement
4. After more talks you decide the candidate is not a good fit.

Even in SV, when I was out and about, I don&#x27;t think I ever saw more than perhaps 10-20% of people in my sight line using a laptop.<p>It is a small minority of people who routinely use laptops outside their home or office. Unfortunately, they will be disproportionately represented on HN.<p>I think the article&#x27;s underlying thesis remains correct today. &quot;Computers&quot; are mostly used at a person&#x27;s home or the office. Regular on-the-go use is niche, both because few people have the need, and because laptops are awkward to use without at least a decent table and chair (and tray tables don&#x27;t qualify!). It is smartphones and tablets, with a vastly different interaction model, that have become a constant presence, and even those chiefly for entertainment and personal communication -- not work.<p>The most &quot;wrong&quot; thing in the article is simply overlooking that laptops would eventually become small enough, light enough, and powerful enough that they could usefully substitute for desktop computers without being meaningfully less convenient to haul back and forth than &quot;a few floppy disks&quot;.<p>But the ability to use one computer both at home and the office -- or even from a hotel room -- does not significantly detract from the author&#x27;s point, which has much more to do with usage model.",1428284450

However I&#x27;ve not seen any actual benefits, people work more get paid less (whether in actual or effective salary e.g. benefits).

X in whatever you choose, in this case &quot;spot in the hierarchy.&quot; That assumption right there, which if accepted as fact, may well lead to this feeling. I&#x27;d say it works to consider whether this assumption is fact or not fact. I&#x27;d say it is not fact, because you can choose. In other words, one reason you can determine your spot in the hierarchy is you can make choices, and create improvements for yourself.<p><i>What about luck?</i><p>If we accept that luck is something wholly out of our control, then there is no point thinking about luck. If we accept luck is somewhat within our control, in terms of creating causes which create possibilities for certain  conditions to arise, then it works to consider, &quot;How can I do things which create possibilities?&quot; So whatever the nature of &quot;luck&quot;, the power to determine is up to you.<p><i>What about &quot;structural inhibitors of success&quot;, such as, genes that don&#x27;t work, physical or mental disability, structural oppression like sexism or racism, or being born in a poor country or family, or anything else?</i><p>Again, it works to rationally consider each of these compelling excuses for a lack of achievement. There are people who have possessed these, and at the same time succeeded.<p>Perhaps anything people sometimes cite as an excuse or obstacle to &quot;explain&quot; a lack of achievement, are simply opportunities to create improvements, again?<p>One way of looking at difficulties is that they are treasures leading you to the success that perhaps you have chosen for yourself. If it&#x27;s the &quot;difficulties&quot; that you feel are preventing you from achievement, doesn&#x27;t that also make them the very opportunities for things to improve to create your achievement?<p>Another way is thinking about athletes: how many great swimmers started life as kids with asthma? It was the very difficulty that was in fact an opportunity for them to create this improvement. And they succeeded.<p>It&#x27;s perhaps incorrect to say Zuck was having trouble meeting people at Harvard, but isn&#x27;t there something to the idea that it was the very difficulty with easily knowing about other people in college, that was an opportunity for him to create Facebook?<p>From the point of view of startups, anything which is a difficulty for some people, is the perfect business opportunity, and people will pay you to solve it for them. So if you are born without difficulties, perhaps you are very unlucky indeed, tho if you are rich in difficulties perhaps you have many opportunities to create success :)<p>Yes, there are plenty of people with difficulties you can cite as being unsuccessful, however, it works to consider the question: does that say something about the life-determining power of difficulties or does it say something about how those people have thought about their difficulties?<p>The idea that we are not responsible for the path our lives take is an extremely compelling delusion, and because so much of people&#x27;s self-explanation of why they haven&#x27;t been successful hinges on blaming external factors, they will defend the truth they ascribe to these factors with all their will, because their entire satisfied relationship with an unsatisfying life rests on that fallacy. The alternate choice, to take responsibility, and see they also had power to choose to do things differently that may have produced different results, means surrendering the fake pay-off of blaming something else.<p>Fake pay-offs are addictive feelings that let people feel like they have achieved something without actually having done so. They&#x27;re what people substitute for actually choosing to take responsibility. If you can feel okay about your lack of achievement, if you can deal with seeing other people&#x27;s success by explaining it as being because you are a victim of circumstance, or they are privileged, or their success is not real success, then you can say, &quot;It&#x27;s not my responsibility I didn&#x27;t achieve like them.&quot; This is like a tonic you apply to your challenging feeling of witnessing another&#x27;s success. Except it&#x27;s fake. Because you didn&#x27;t achieve something. And it doesn&#x27;t work for you, because saying &quot;it&#x27;s not my responsibility&quot;, actually disempowers you, and trains you out of thinking of ways you can actually choose to create improvements, that may lead to success.<p>Sadly, it seems fake pay-offs like in the narrative above are almost as compelling as actually achieving something for real. If people really do achieve below their potential, I&#x27;d say repeating incorrect, disempowering narratives is one contributing reason.<p>What’s the antidote to these kind of narratives?
Realizing you can create narratives that empower you based on taking responsibility. This doesn’t require disempowering anyone else (which is really just a kind of weakness), rather, by realizing that you have choice, you will see that there is no one to blame, and that in any situation, you are responsible for how it is going for you.<p><i>What else is required?</i><p>I’d say that having a workable relationship to other people’s success works. When you see someone else successful, be inspired by that success and ask, “Wow, that’s cool, how can I get that for myself?” If you choose to be jealous, it’s just going to more readily lead to narratives where: you’re not responsible for your own lack of success, and their success is not real because they’re privileged or because it was fake.<p>That is one way of addressing the fake idea that it is the difficulties, instead of our choices, which limit our lives.<p>From another perspective, yes, &quot;everyone is average.&quot; By definition this is true. Yet what is the nature of that truth? Is it a powerful all-encompassing truth? Or just a weak truism? If you unpack it it&#x27;s &quot;everyone except for a few outliers are within a few standard deviations of the mean&quot;. That’s not the kind of life-determining truth that’s going to rock your world. That’s just talking about some unmentioned metric, by which everyone’s measure is being taken. Maybe your standards are different. Maybe the measure by which you are average is unimportant for you.<p>And maybe even if you are average today, you may not be in 5 or 10 years time. Maybe you will be the next Jony Ive. If you get there, it won’t be because it was given to you, it will be because you kept making choices that worked to get you there.<p>In terms of how weak the impact of ostensibly “big” difficulties can be, consider this: Steve Jobs is dead. And he’s still having an impact. I’d say there’s plenty of things you can do with the life you have.<p>All of the above works if your choice is to try to do something extraordinary.<p><i>Being Average</i><p>If you just want a normal, average life, then you really do not have to worry about such highfalutin notions of taking responsibility, or empowerment. Because the average delusions adopted by many will work just fine, and may even keep things smoother, because in the masses people expect to blame each other and be blamed for things that aren&#x27;t their responsibility. Complaining is the great refuge of the average person, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.<p>So if you would prefer an average life, then a more &quot;average looking&quot; philosophy will work, and that&#x27;s totally okay too. Even if you want to just take a break from being an entrepreneur this can work! The Buddhist notion of detachment from worldly forms, which are all just like lights and magic in a stage play, and empty of inherent reality because they&#x27;re just the result of a whole bunch of other causes, works as somewhere to start. The Daoist notion of &quot;achieve by not achieving, act by not acting&quot; also works.<p>Just let go, and be content with average. Stop grasping after worldly forms, and you&#x27;ll be happy. There&#x27;s plenty of people who will show you the way to be content with an average life. Society (and your biology) already has a prescription prepared for you: entertainment, eating, drinking, love and sex, partying. These are the great distractions which can make you feel better about your lack of achievement. Which is not to say they are not good in themselves, nor that there is anything wrong with maintaining social harmony, only to talk about how we&#x27;ve constructed them as aspirational myths, which also work as great distractions from actually achieving. And if you have a highfalutin notion that you want to be a somebody, watch a hero movie, and play out your fantasies on the big screen, through the entertaining catharsis of being someone who never existed.<p>Which is not to say that if you do want to be a &quot;serious entrepreneur&quot; you got to feel guilty enjoying such entertainment. Enjoy it. And do your work. If you just enjoy it, and believe it&#x27;s the pinnacle of aspiration, and then do nothing, you&#x27;ll be average.<p>Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that, and maybe average is what you already chose, and you&#x27;re looking for a way to accept it. Combine the great distractions for the more biological and adrenal urges, with the Buddhist and Daoist philosophies for the more cerebral ones, and you&#x27;re set. Averageness Nirvana. Or choose to take responsibility and choose to be extraordinary. Rich in Difficulties. Blue Bill, Red Pill. :)<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with being average, nor with everybody choosing an average life at all. Cows in the field are happy, and they&#x27;re not doing anything special at all. In India, cows do even less, and there they&#x27;re gods.<p>If the people are happy, all is well. In fact, that&#x27;s a really important measure of how well things are -- how happy are the average people? All of your technologies mean nothing if they don&#x27;t contribute to people being happy and free. Just because someone is average doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not special.<p>And then there&#x27;s biology. Darwinism explains why extraordinary success is not really a positive selective pressure, because even if you&#x27;re a 1000x success over average, you don&#x27;t have 1000x offspring over average. We&#x27;re not selected to be extraordinary, which is not an excuse, and is another way to think about how being extraordinary is really a choice people make.<p><i>Average people benefit from extraordinary people. When they do, extraordinary people&#x27;s work becomes meaningful.</i><p>I also think it&#x27;s important that there are people who are choosing to create technologies to advance the human race. One reason is because then everyone choosing to be average can have a better quality of average, and that&#x27;s awesome. Like what if all disease was cured? And aging could be reversed with periodic maintenance? And we had an energy source which let us build and feed everyone to a minimum standard level? That would be so awesome, and that&#x27;s just some of the things that are possible with technology. So long as a there are people choosing to be extraordinary, and make things that are meaningful for average people, that will happen. If you create a technology that nobody uses, it&#x27;s not a technology. It&#x27;s an experiment, it&#x27;s research.<p>The ideas above are just one way which works to be extraordinary. If being extraordinary is what you choose, there&#x27;s a whole bunch of other ways to do it, and there&#x27;s more things in this way that work too. Taking responsibility for your own path works as a place to start tho. Also, being positive, constructive, creative and figuring things out for yourself work too.<p><i>Footnote: If you want to be extraordinary do it in tech, not research</i><p>And if you&#x27;re capable of making something people use, I&#x27;d say you have a responsibility to capture value from that so that you can fund yourself to create the possibility of your making more things in future. That&#x27;s why science is more broken than tech, because the people with capacity to do useful things are not the ones ensured to keep doing useful things in future. It&#x27;s a apprentice system, not a free market, and that doesn&#x27;t work because it doesn&#x27;t most incent the people who can create the most value.",1428283591

That takes a lot of rigorous attentiveness and practice.<p>The really cool thing is– as long as you&#x27;re not making stuff up (eg: faking social proof for a product that nobody actually likes), you&#x27;re going to legitimately improve perceptions of your product.

  * Use ES6 if you want http://blog.thoughtram.io/angularjs/es6/2015/01/23/exploring-angular-1.3-using-es6.html
  * Build components using element tags not classes. (attributes are fine but components are better expressed as unique elements).

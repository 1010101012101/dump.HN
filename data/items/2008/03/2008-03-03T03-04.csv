127794,comment,127711,127784,0,0,ghiotion,,,"Fair enough.  However, I'm probably going to state what will be an unpopular opinion but one which is, I think, nevertheless true: spanking a child teaches a valuable lesson.  I hardly ever do it, and I never do it as a punishment to be meted out later (as in, wait 'till your daddy gets home, then you're going to get it!).  In the case where you've got a child who's prone to hit, I think it's reasonable to hit them back.  Not with the same force, but it's a valuable lesson to learn that if you hit someone, you're going to get hit back.  I don't want my kids to learn that they can physically intimate someone without consequence.  Lacking that negative reinforcement, I _think_ you've got a bully in the making.",1204516785

127790,comment,127734,127775,0,0,rms,,,"For SNP testing, the cost of micro-arrays and micro-array reading machines are way too much for at home use. Whole genome testing right now is astronomically more expensive than SNP testing.<p>However, if the rapidly decreasing cost of genetic sequencing keeps up, then it will eventually be possible to create at home genome sequencers that feed into your home computer to analyze the data. The privacy paranoid will have to pay a significant premium for this privilege.<p>Also, a DNA extraction machine would have to be bundled with the at home sequencer, ideally in one machine, and DNA extraction machines are also too expensive for home use. Without a machine, DNA extraction involves proprietary solution combined with various steps of heating and centrifuging.",1204516405
127789,comment,127711,127765,0,0,jojoleflaire,,,"I second this advice.<p>I have two daughters. The oldest is 4 going on 5, the youngest is closing in on 2. I guess I read the same books as my wife when she was pregnant with our oldest daughter (""What to Expect When You're Expecting"", and some encyclopedic books regarding kids development and diseases). But neither of us has really resorted to any kind of manuals since then.<p>The most surprising thing (to me, at least) about having kids was the realization that they aren't alien creatures or high maintenance robots, but little people with their own very different personalities, even as newborns. And like other people you need to engage them on their level. And the relationship evolves from there.<p>So I guess my advice here is listen to them first. Read some clinical books to get the facts about sickness and heath, and when to call a doctor, but your let own observations be the main guide. Congratulations!",1204516228

YCombinator is a cleverly descriptive way of naming a company that starts companies. I believe Google's name comes from the idea that it's indexing a huge number of pages.

Whoever called it the Marxism of the right was spot on when it comes to things like this.<p>With an ideological framework you can define certain things to be true without reference to reality, and suddenly you're arguing that reality is failing to live up to your theory and not the other way round. Anything that claims to provide insight into a topic but uses an ideological lens to get there is fundamentally flawed.",1204515089

Just kidding.  Believe me, most of the programmers here understand this completely.  We also understand that things like quantitative market analysis, business plans, etc are for the most part useless because no battle plan survives contact with the enemy.  In this regard, I think we are more right-brained, or at the least more honest, in terms of what we think users want. We put out a rough approximation of what we think they want and let them guide us.  What could be more empathetic than that?",1204514699

However, the Moore's Law equivalent for DNA sequencing blows away the Moore's Law for transistors: every year genetic sequencing has become cheaper by tenfold.<p>23andme's disease risk indicators aren't overly meaningful, because they only test for a few SNPs and true disease risk is made up of many SNPs and multi nucleotide mutations and deletions, as well as levels of miRNA expression. Many of the mutations are only studied in caucasians. For now, most genetic tests are interesting rather than explicitly useful. Five or seven years from now, after Google's 100,000 genome project is complete and you can get a whole genome test for $1000, genetic testing will be very useful. Let's just hope that the results of that study are completely public.",1204514100

127763,comment,127675,127704,0,0,johnrob,,,"(this is slightly off topic)
I'm not crazy about how equity gets distribution in start-ups.  Long story short, founders are compensated for work without salary.  The problem is that stock should go to whoever contributes most to the company.  Just because the founders work for free, doesn't mean they contribute the most critical work.<p>Here is an extreme example to prove a point: I write a business plan and successfully raise money from investors.  Then I hire people to do all the work, pay them salary, and give them much less stock than I take.  I have the largest employee stake, but haven't done any of the 'real' work (unless you consider fund raising to be the real work).<p>This example is absurd, but it's useful to my argument: the founders get their stock by working for free, not necessarily for creating the critical foundation of the business.  For some reason, this has been bothering me lately.  It seems more reasonable to have a system where ownership is determined by contribution... otherwise there will always be the risk of the opposite: contribution being determined by ownership.",1204513863

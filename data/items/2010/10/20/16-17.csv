Except for one problem:<p>""Before you know it, people will automatically know to come to you when nothing else works.""<p>And then what?  Ask for a raise?  In the environment he is describing, it is likely his extra effort will not go unnoticed, but rather, unrewarded.  What's worse, this extra effort may even become expected of him, without his receiving any additional compensation besides making his boss look good.<p>While I do find great satisfaction in making myself indispensable and particularly useful, and in the whole process of learning and implementing new things, I also find extreme irritation if it only works to set a new standard for what's expected of me.  That's just my personal experience and personality.  Perhaps there are more altruistic types that enjoy feeling like a more efficient cog, but for me, it sucks to feel like a cog at all.<p>That's not to say all is lost.  Certainly being an achiever and an innovator are awesome qualities.  Think of your current job as a framework to discover and deploy these things.  I neglected to do this at my last job, but keep a list of <i>all</i> of the projects you took the initiative on, what new skills you had to acquire to achieve them, and the net benefit to the company.  Myself, I always figured I'd remember all the awesome additional effort / personal touches I put on things, but I didn't, and for me, interview season is right around the corner.<p>Bottom line, if you're not progressing and learning from your coworkers on a regular basis, it's time to look for new options.  In the meantime, give your best effort and take note of your triumphs.",1287593883

It wasn't lack of interest on part of other devs, quite the opposite: everyone was just too eager to incorporate new things into the codebase and prove their ideas were the best. It was almost like the wild wild west where anybody could push anything to the codebase and the inexperienced management was excited at the prospect of a cutting edge product.<p>What happened was quite the opposite: the codebase was very inconsistent and there were lots of parts nobody understood. All these conflicts and lack of integration also lead to a lot of bugs which management thought were just part of software engineering. Micromanagement was also rampant and caused significant mental stress.<p>What I am trying to get across is that having overly enthusiastic co-workers is not always a good thing either (the grass is always greener on the other side.) Don't listen too much to what other people are saying about their jobs. Try to figure out what you are missing (I was missing the need to be part of a community and do innovative stuff) and try to find a way to get that (I got involved in an open-source project where I found I could contribute and be part of the community and do good things.)

Next thing you know, you're out the door.  In time he re-learns the lesson that you get what you pay for, but too late for you.<p>Corporate IT in the US is fast becoming a wasteland of foreign graduates desperate for green cards, outsourced consultants and offshoring.  IMO the only options as a programmer in the developed world are to go very high end, do a startup where you sell directly to the end user who doesn't care what kind of programmer you are, or get out of the programming field altogether.",1287593622
1811885,comment,1810487,1811302,0,0,equark,,,"I considered both Backbone and Knockout and ended up with Knockout, although both are great!  I find Knockout's simple declarative binding to be cleaner for most cases:<p><pre><code>  <span data-bind:""text: title""></span>\n</code></pre>\nAnd Knockout allows you to put bindings in code too, where that makes sense.  I also like the way Knockout keeps everything in the view model, rather than passing in the observable attributes when constructing an instance.  For instance:<p><pre><code>  var Sidebar = Backbone.Model.extend({\n    promptColor: function() {\n      var cssColor = prompt(""Please enter a CSS color:"");\n      this.set({color: cssColor});\n    }\n  });\n</code></pre>\nHere color doesn't exist yet.  I guess this is just standard javascript style?  In Knockout (+coffeescript), I'd write:<p><pre><code>  class SideBar\n    color: ko.observable('white')\n    promptColor: ->\n       @color(prompt('Please enter CSS color:'))\n</code></pre>\nMy model is self-contained.  This example also shows the syntax for updating and getting values.  I prefer Knockout's<p><pre><code>  @color(cssColor)\n</code></pre>\nto Backbone's<p>@set({color: cssColor})<p>although this is minor and perhaps you want to allow for bulk updates.<p>I can't help but feel that these types of libraries are the future.  I hope there is lots of cross-pollination going on.  Sproutcore focuses on the 5 percent of webapps that should be desktop style.  Both Knockout and Backbone give lots of the same benefits, but allow a more flexible application style.<p>My only wish is for a language agnostic persistence protocol, with some socket.io and REST protocols implemented for most frameworks/languages.  Ideally, I could use this protocol to sync with my iPhone/Android/HTML5 app, without changing the server side. This could get very hairy (FeedSync/LiveMesh/Wave), but something simple that accomplishes 90% would be a great.",1287593614

1811846,comment,1810119,1810119,0,0,regularfry,,,"1) Read Genius, by James Gleick. It's a biography of Feynman which mostly concentrates on his life story (with just enough of his work thrown in to keep my inner physics geek happy) which happens to contain a couple of intriguing hints as to how he thought. Reading between the lines, I suspect he was (or had become) synaesthetic - he describes formulae as having colour, and combining them as entities rather than as series of symbols. He also mentions not understanding how his students comprehended equations if they could not see them this way, so he clearly understood that there was something different going on in his own head.<p>If that's true, it's a hint as to how he was such a formidable force, because somehow his sensory and proprioceptive apparatus had arranged to map directly to mathematical concepts such that intuitive manipulations which the brain is very, very good at doing anyway (because they are what's needed to drive the body and survive day-to-day) generated useful, valid, mathematical results. Or possibly, given descriptions of how he worked from other people, they generated many more options, whether valid or not, in a shorter time than anyone else, which meant he had a larger sample of possible ideas to pull the best one from.<p>Whether that translates to other geniuses or not, I don't know, but when people refer to ""genius,"" they are referring to a qualitative difference in thought patterns. Where conventional thought might be verbal, symbolic manipulation, they are somehow using a higher level of abstraction. Finding a mapping between subject-specific concepts (like formulae, or chess positions) and something else your brain does ""in the background"" would seem to fit that.<p>2) No. I am not a genius. But I can do some things <i>faster</i> than other people.",1287592869

Not being satisfied with how we've brought people on in the pass I spent some time researching better ways to interview and we now follow a system similar to Amazon with two phone interviews, a lot of free hand coding, formal rating sheets, white board work, team and individual interviews, etc.<p>Two things I've learned:\nA. Many really good candidate will excel at this interview approach. They have fun showing off their skills for us to see and are unfazed by the work, detailed questions, or any other pressure that we try to apply to them..\nB. Most developers I talk to are horrible at this type of interview, have no idea what the interviewer might be looking for, and cannot sell themselves, their ideas, or their skills. I've talked to people who have 8 years or relevant experience and a strong CS education but when asked a simple coding question they freeze like a deer in headlights. Like most folks, I can't waste company time on people who probably can do the job but can't pass some basic challenges.<p>Long story short, I'm wondering about putting together a class to train developers in how to interview/market themselves to employers. This would include class work, white boarding practice, coding practice, mock phone interviews, group discussion, etc. My thought is that for developers often trying to make 6 figure salaries that this should be worth something to them ($500, $1000?). Additionally it also functions as a way for me to pass on extremely good candidates to recruiters, etc.<p>My questions:\n- Already being done?\n- Not done, but still a crazy idea?\n- How would one get started?\n- Would tech people (shy, nervous, self doubting souls that they are) be willing to submit to a day or two of training?\n- Would people pay me for it (assuming of course that I'd be any good at it)?",1287590683

Android rated higher in some questions, but trying to pass it off as having found an ""overwhelming preference"" (for either platform) is a gross distortion. From the top-level findings of the survey:<p>""Apple iOS continues to dominate in all categories relating to market/revenue opportunity and current devices. iPhone continues to lead overall developer sentiment with 91% saying they are “very interested” in developing for the device compared to 82% for Android phones.""<p>Overwhelming, huh? The rest of the results are kind of interesting and kind of predictable, but definitely not what the author is trying to pass it off as.<p>[the survey]:<a href=""http://www.appcelerator.com/mobile-developer-report-September-2010/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appcelerator.com/mobile-developer-report-Septembe...</a><p>[submitted previously]:<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1798878"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1798878</a>",1287590488

They also had the carts locked up so you needed to deposit a quarter (which you got back by locking your cart up again), didn't take credit cards (only debit/cash), and didn't have name-brand anything.<p>It worked fine, except that their bread would often start to grow mold by the time we were maybe two-thirds through a loaf (which doesn't seem to happen with bread from other stores). We'd probably still go there for other things, except that we always need bread and going to two separate stores is annoying.",1287590488

Most developpers I know consider it a day job, they do it, generally well, collect their money and get on with their lives.<p>I suspect most people on this board, most certainly including myself, are not like that.  But we are the minority and I have nothing against the majority that wants to do that.<p>As to practical suggestions for the OP to keep growing: Find a community of people like you.  My expertise is in SQL and I used to attend the local user group meetings (it now conflicts with my night classes in grad school).  I still both write for and read sites like www.sqlservercentral.com where I can participate in the community in a virtual sense at least.<p>Also, you may want to consider going back to grad school, if your schedule permits it.  It gives you a ready made community of smart people pursuing things at least vaguely in your field.  This is more important than the classes or the piece of paper at the end, but that piece of paper can make a nice addition the next time you are in the job market.",1287590435

Further conceptualize it by thinking of the footprint of a decent cluster, with all the 1u blades spread out over a certain area.  Definitely feasible, though i recognize your computations are die size, not total computer size.",1287590430

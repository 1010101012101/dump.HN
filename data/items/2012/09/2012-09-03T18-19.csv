Let's say I want to know the position.  How am I going to do that?  Well, by throwing a photon at it.  If the wavelength is small we can find the position fairly accurately but it's going to transfer momentum to the electron and we really don't know how much and it's a relatively major effect.  Hmph.  Alright, let's measure the momentum instead.  We need a longer wavelength so we don't disturb the electron too much.  Great, we get a very good value for the momentum!  But, unfortunately, the long wavelength is not very accurate for determining the position.<p>Other intrinsic problems arise even sticking with the photon idea but hopefully this is enough of something to latch onto to help you start to understand.",1346697219

Fights over Constitutionally ""enumerated"" rights are simply code words for ignoring the 9th amendment. i.e. the framers of the Constitution knew that they could not possibly enumerate all rights from the get go and were bound to make mistakes (especially since most of the rights they <i>were</i> enumerating had not been traditionally recognized before).<p><i>The Framers did not intend that the first eight amendments be construed to exhaust the basic and fundamental rights.... I do not mean to imply that the .... Ninth Amendment constitutes an independent source of rights protected from infringement by either the States or the Federal Government....While the Ninth Amendment - and indeed the entire Bill of Rights - originally concerned restrictions upon federal power, the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States as well from abridging fundamental personal liberties. And, the Ninth Amendment, in indicating that not all such liberties are specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments, is surely relevant in showing the existence of other fundamental personal rights, now protected from state, as well as federal, infringement. In sum, the Ninth Amendment simply lends strong support to the view that the ""liberty"" protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments from infringement by the Federal Government or the States is not restricted to rights specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments.

Unless they fail that error code doesn't even get run.<p>My test code currently has to put the program into a state where cat can be called, and then has to mock/augment each failure point, and then check the results.  Just having the middle piece (mock/augment) done automagically would be a massive help.  And then of course cat itself can fail so each of its callers needs a way of testing too.  Some hand wavy combination of convention over configuration, documentation and annotations would likely help.<p>Even the state issue should be automatable in many circumstances.  For example you could make a successful run of the program, and then the magic records state at the entrance to code blocks.  It can cause each failure circumstance, rewind state to known good and cause the next failure circumstance etc.<p>I'd even be happy running my code (with no error handling) under some tool that induces the errors - when they aren't handled it asks me what I want to do which typically involves writing code to handle the issue, which it then directly integrates and keeps running until the next error.<p>Even test pass/fail can be somewhat automatable.

Also, from building social network clones(for $200) to building proper webapps for well known startups and companies like Compete, Hubspot.<p>* Sign up for all freelancer Marketplaces: Elance, Odesk, Guru, Freelancer, RentACoder.<p>* Sign up for RSS feeds for jobs(full time/freelance) in your domain.<p>* Start bidding, sending out emails to all of the above that apply.<p>* You're bidding against devs from 3rd world countries(so you will have to price somewhere in the median atleast until you get your first decent folio piece done)<p>* Also it doesn't matter if your request doesn't exactly apply. Don't be self-selective. Also even if you don't expect to get that job, apply still. Get your name out.<p>* Be very communicative, friendly and more open than a simple 'Here's my folio' etc. You're trying to sell yourself, so figure out what the client want, customize your pitch. This part will take a bit of hit and trial on your end to figure out how to get the first client reply. If your post looks like others, then you won't get one.<p>* Work on the side on your own project, something that's production worthy and you can showcase if the above steps haven't worked till then.<p>* Reply to posts on HN, Ask HN like Who's hiring + Who's hiring a freelancer. Even add yourself to HN contractor list and anything similar you see elswhere.<p>* Market, Market, Market every chance you get. I used to spend atleast 3-4 hrs initially just sifting through job posts, replying, emailing everyday.<p>* Remember to raise your prices sooner than you think.<p>* Recently i've been trying out Google adwords, which haven't really led to a lot of hits. But i've been getting like 1 really good query for like 100 clicks. For the average amount i make per invoice, that ad costs are very minor even at the ridiculous CPCs to hit the front page.<p>* A lot of people mention word-of-mouth here. This is really the best way. For every satisfied client you're essentially expanding your network exponentially and getting in touch with people you would never have come across. But initially since you might not have a portfolio, it will be difficult to get work this way. Also until you're able to price your work higher than average, you won't get the right kind of clients. And without the right clients you won't get paid higher. So it's a vicious cycle you need to get out of by piling up showcase work as soon as possible.<p>* With lower rates it will be difficult to sustain work, since you would have to take on more work before the current one is over. Hence your focus suffers and work quality too. So you're hampering your prices, word-of-mouth network further if you take on work and underdeliver. I've been guilty of doing this(probably still am).<p>* So as soon as you get too much work to handle, double your rates.<p>PS: I'm one of the third world dev that people on HN are very fond of :-)<p>PS2: Since i posted the link to my site <a href=""http://www.cloudshuffle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudshuffle.com</a> at the top of this post.

I'd stay up 24-48 hours straight sometimes coding, and what I do now is more productive in more areas of my life.  There's no comparison. Zero.

Proponents of niche languages, almost by definition, never have a body of work to show that is equal to that of the mainstream languges.</i><p>I'm not expecting equal bodies of work. Just show something.<p>Forget the enterprise, big companies and such. How about lone wolf programmers? Where are the Lisp gurus ""beating the averages"" and producing some killer stuff? 3-4 apps would suffice. For Lisp I can see very few things, statistical noise almost. Heck, even Erlang has Riak.<p>One way to see it is: ""of course Lisp doesn't have a large body of A-list programs written in it, since it has less programmers"". This is your reading of the situation.<p>Another way, though, is:<p>""there is a reason Lisp doesn't have as much A-list programs written in it, and it's not adoption. The reason goes deeper and it also explains adoption"".<p>One explanation: Lisp was too high level for the machines of past era to run sufficiently. That explains why it didn't caught on in the past. It means that despite being conceptually better, it was a bad language for the problems most people were trying to solve (squeeze the last trace of CPU and memory juice from very constrained hardware).<p>And now? Now other languages have the most essential of the high level features it used to have, so other factors weight more in using them over Lisp (e.g available programmers, libraries, etc). Which means again that despite being conceptually better, it is a bad language for the things people do now (front end web stuff needs JS, enterprise needs Java/.NET and Oracle/MS support, embedded needs C, web apps need Node/RoR/Django/PHP, etc).<p>Not a single niche where Lisp is the best option.<p>Consider eg that: Productivity = LanguageProductivity + EnvironmentProductivity.<p>And let's take the scientific computing field. Even if Lisp, the language, has 70 productivity points over 50 for Python, the Environment for Python has 80 points (NymPu, Scipy, Sage, etc) over 20 for Lisp.<p>So, Lisp = 70 + 20, Python = 50 + 80, hence Python wins.<p>(The numbers are out of my ass, but you can make a similar thought experiment and, people that make it come to similar conclusions when they pick their tools. Even PG if he had to build something today he would have picked RoR, not CL).<p>Lisp guys tend to argue that Lisp has ""language productivity"" of 100, but I don't think so. And even it it has it's not 2-10 times the productivity of something like Python the language. Maybe 20-30% better.<p>In the grande scheme of things, macros don't matter that much.",1346695496

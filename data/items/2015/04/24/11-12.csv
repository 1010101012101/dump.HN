Me, for example, I&#x27;ve been through much more and grown quite a bit as a person in last 5 years (moved to different country), then in first 28 years of my life (33 now). Looking back, it feels like a lifetime and a bit more (weekends mostly in the mountains, either ski touring or hiking/climbing/etc), travelling around the world - recently 2 weeks in indonesia, etc).

Which is bad.<p>Scalable CSS writing ( even more important for a CSS framework that you use as a base ) consists of a more modular approach to your stylesheet.<p>Let&#x27;s say you have a list I would usually do it :<p><pre><code>    <ul class=&#x27;collection&#x27;>\n      <li class=&#x27;collection-item&#x27;>\n        <a class=&#x27;button button--primary&#x27;></a>\n      </li>\n      <li class=&#x27;collection-item&#x27;>Normal Text</li>\n    </ul>\n</code></pre>\nBy doing this I can safely remove the .button, code ( module ) and put it somewhere else on my page without affecting how it will look like. Something more if I feel that I have a totally different link in this exact place, well yes.

Indian/Chinese, that have moved to Middle East, America, EU) often grow in isolation from the locals. As such, the kids growing up there may feel camaraderie with their peers (fellow immigrants in their Asian-dominated school) but not really with the city. They go to the coffee shop and see someone &quot;not like them&quot; working there. They don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like growing up in our household. If the town isn&#x27;t a higher education or career hotbed, we probably leave for college and never come back. Even when we visit home, none of our friends are there anymore.<p>I have no such thing as a home. I love my parents who are still together, but I can&#x27;t relate to anything to their home -- where they grew up in their home country. The place I grew up in? Some strangers live there since it was some (series of) tiny rented apartments near my middle/high school. I am a foreigner everywhere I go.<p>But sometimes I&#x27;m in a city where I relate to more people, I make friends easily, the city cares about the same things as I do. It may feel like home. But often circumstances won&#x27;t let someone like me stay in such a city long enough for it to <i>really</i> be my home. The city that feels closest to being home for me, I&#x27;ve spent merely 2 years in, during my early 20s. I haven&#x27;t been able to go back the last 2 years, and I miss it like how I guess other people say they miss home, that I never understood until recently.<p>&quot;Home&quot; and &quot;where are you from&quot; are confusing and loaded phrases for many people like me.",1429876486

Semantic HTML and CSS are pretty amazing at adapting content fluidly and dynamically to a wide range of users and devices. Search engines expect documents to be laid out in a certain way. Web scrapers can add a whole pile of usefulness even to sites that don&#x27;t create explicit public data APIs. You&#x27;re going to have a serious hell of a time making it any better, and can easily make it a lot worse.<p>And on the other hand, content sites aren&#x27;t the be-all, end-all of the Web anymore. The Web is increasingly a deployment platform for applications, and there are a whole host of applications that just can&#x27;t be done in the browser without JS. Luddites who complain about &quot;but I got JS disabled&quot; aren&#x27;t the target market for an image-editor-in-the-browser.

9432564,comment,9419601,9431464,0,0,tinco,,,"> Please, no book, but I would be happy to read one concrete example of why Ruby/Bundler is substantially better hands down.<p>One illustrative example might be the existance of Celluloid. The idea that you as a developer of Ruby apps can swap out the I/O system to something that&#x27;s arguable better than what what the default style is. The reason Javascript can&#x27;t do that is because it doesn&#x27;t have synchronous I/O, nor multithreading, it&#x27;s simply lacking those primitives.<p>I don&#x27;t like the callback style, and I&#x27;m not entirely sold on promises.<p>In any case both those &#x27;issues&#x27; might be close to fundamental differences between Ruby and Javascript but if I&#x27;m honest, this is going to sound like I&#x27;m back pedalling, but in real measurable terms they won&#x27;t affect the quality of your codebase. I don&#x27;t think porting a library from Javascript to Ruby would solve any real problem (as Haskell would), and it would result in your library being slower.<p>The dozens of little things that make Ruby a more pleasant language, they are what keeps me on the Ruby side for most projects.<p>> I am quite aware that some Haskell lover is probably laughing and sticking their nose up at this entire conversation.<p>Haha, I&#x27;m actually also a Haskell programmer. My top 3 is Ruby, Haskell, C# ;) I do Ruby and CoffeeScript for a living, build games in C# as a hobby and am building a C compiler in Haskell as my secret plot to take over the world. I have a sideproject that&#x27;s a REST API in Haskell as well, but I&#x27;m not 100% convinced yet that Haskell is right for that.<p>Easy proofs for Haskell superiority: You can compile into a static executable. You can make the typesystem enforce the correctness of your user input parsing (this is crazy effective in JSON Apis, so effective that I now use Grape in Ruby to do sort of the same thing). Its lack of OO and focus on processing data leads to very clean architecture. Its level of abstraction is so crazy that they can actually swap out their entire I/O system for another one without changing any application interfaces, this one blew my mind, it&#x27;s the change that makes GHC 7.8 run the Warp webserver twice as fast. They actually changed it so the &#x27;fork&#x27; system call does not actually spawn a new thread, it spawns a fiber that&#x27;s run in an event loop type system, and changed all the I/O functions to use asynchronous I/O on that event loop. All of this without changing a line in Warp, they just transparently made every traditional Haskell use modern I/O principles. Academics man, they&#x27;re smart ;)<p>C# is cool because it manages to stay clean, fast and structured even though it&#x27;s super powerful and implements almost every paradigm known to man. It&#x27;s a statically typed compiled language with near native performance, yet code in it is nearly as succinct as Ruby. If I&#x27;d jump ship from Ruby because of performance reasons, it&#x27;d be to C#, not Node.js. Provided it runs smoothly on linux of course ;)",1429875352

But as you are pointing out, you learned a lot from Haskell and you are using its lessons in production.<p>The best a language can do is to fill a niche and to be very good at that particular thing. You should always use the language that is most suited for your problem, whatever that is. But there are many languages that let you get away with being a terrible programmer. Haskell just isn&#x27;t like that and I want to point out that you can learn a great deal from being forced to think in more abstract ways, just like you did.<p>In programming, we often encounter the temptation to just mutate everything and to use side-effects since it&#x27;s quite convenient to do so in the short-term. In the long-term, these things will come back and bite us. I argue that it is important that a programmer should have experienced what it is like to simply not have the option to do so. After learning Haskell, I tried to avoid side-effects in other languages as much as possible and to use them consciously. That was something I didn&#x27;t even consider before learning Haskell. And, obviously, the less side-effects you have, the easier it is to maintain or exchange parts of your program.<p>I currently use Haskell to calculate probably a hundred analytical derivatives for a large sparse array that is used in a simulator written in Fortran. And it&#x27;s very good at that. For quickly writing some evaluations of output of this simulator I use Python, because Python is better suited.<p>Pick a language based on the problem. Don&#x27;t just use one language because you know it. In my experience, Haskell is very well suited for a lot of mathematical stuff.<p>------<p>Off topic:<p>By the way, Einstein&#x27;s field equations will work for gravity in the classical regime, not in all cases. But still, if you simply want to calculate how far you&#x27;ll throw a ball, you really should take another model based on Newtonian gravity or simply take a constant gravitational force. Planetary movements are also fine with Newtonian gravity (except when you really need it accurately. E.g. for the precession of the perihelion of mercury). However, GPS calculations are terribly inaccurate without general relativity (time flows differently if you are close to a big gravitational potential well). So, pick your model based on what you want to do, just like you pick your programming language based on what you want to do.",1429875143

It&#x27;s the fact that studying is supposed to be a full-time occupation. We don&#x27;t ask of 12 year olds to work a 40 hour week, but we do of 20 year olds despite the fact they have as many classes but a higher study load outside of class.<p>Now if we consider that studying ought to be a full-time occupation, there&#x27;s obviously an opportunity cost to studying or lack thereof. It&#x27;s not just having to pay 15k per year for tuition, it&#x27;s also forgoing the opportunity to work a job and make money to pay every expense a non-studying adult human normally needs to pay, rent, food, insurance etc. Another $15k per year is on the low-end.<p>So you end up with 30k over 4 years, at an average of 5% interest rates you easily graduate with 150k debt.<p>This is unworkable. So we require of students to work extra jobs next to their studies, knowing juggling a 70h work week for years on end while still living under crappy circumstances negatively affects studies, health etc. We require students to choose jobs that are most financially rewarding (knowing all too well that pursuing remuneration over everything else leads not to happiness, and that at the higher end the correlation between salary and benefit to society is weak). We see students accessing higher education with funds from family, something reserved for the (upper) middle class, and even for these kids it&#x27;s very normal to have to not view studying as a full-time occupation despite being enrolled in a full-time program, and even so average debt in many countries sits around 30-50k.<p>Meanwhile, a country like Germany is offering free tuition, without having invented a magic money machine.",1429874032

I&#x27;m not saying that this is a bad goal, but rather than try to compromise in this manner, the Haskell community has often adopted terminology that is precise instead of intuitive.<p>Functors could have been Mappables, but how far would that analogy hold, and who is already familiar with maps in this context? Better to use an accurate term, and when someone unfamiliar with it learns it in this context, they will be able to apply it to many other contexts.<p>> Put in syntax redundancy and visual space to avoid the word soup effect: typing is cheap, understanding is expensive. Normalise and simplify terminology.<p>On the surface, I&#x27;ve always supported this - if only for the reason that I would always like to be able to pronounce a combinator when I&#x27;m talking to someone. The downside would be the combinatorial explosion of different subsets of names that people would learn for even one library. I&#x27;m not sure weather it would be a net plus or minus.<p>> Fix the semantic warts which make hacks like `seq` necessary --- if I need to worry about strictness and order of evaluation, then the language is doing lazy wrong. etc.<p>I think you will find that this is an unsolved problem. Better to allow people to be explicit when necessary instead of making the language totally unusable.<p>> Basically I want language X such that X:Haskell like Java:K&R C.<p>I think I understand the sentiment, but the analogy feels too shallow. For instance, I would make the following predictions from your analogy - Do they hold?<p>* Runs on a virtual machine instead of being compiled\n* Extraordinary measures taken to make the language and binary-formats backwards compatible.\n* More type-safe\n* Less primitives\n* More automated memory-management<p>> This will never happen, of course; the people who have the knowledge to do such a thing won&#x27;t do it because they are fully indoctrinated into the Haskell Way Of Life...<p>Indoctrinated is obviously a loaded term. I think you will find that nearly all Haskell programmers in any position to influence the development of the language are very open-minded when it comes to new ideas. Part of the reason why Haskell looks the way it does today is because it was intended to be a platform for experimentation.",1429873555

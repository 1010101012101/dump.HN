1906083,comment,1905445,1905998,0,0,notahacker,,,"""Quibbling about terminology"" isn't ""silly"" when someone is making a public accusation of a sex crime. Neither of us are lawers, but right there in the statutes you've posted is the line ""Sexual contact means any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the person is a female, a breast, <i>for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.</i>"" [emphasis mine].<p>I don't think that brushing up against erogenous zones as part of a search procedure constitues ""sexual contact"" <i>even though I agree that the TSA employee appears to have failed to give adequate warning and shown a lack of discretion in singling out a new mother in the first place</i>. I don't doubt the indignity of her experience may have been shocking and upsetting, but it stopped well short of sexual abuse.<p>As other people have pointed out in this thread with rather more eloquence than me, the semantics actually are important here (i) because sexual assault is a very serious crime with significant consequences for both victim and perpetrator (ii) because hyperbole detracts from serious scrutiny of the boundaries of acceptability.",1289825937

1906064,comment,1903963,1905616,0,0,acabal,,,"It's all pretty easy.  Every country seems to have their Craigslist equivalent where you can find apartments to stay in for a short term (a month or two).  I've spent a lot of time in hostels in the past, which are a fun and cheap way to live as well.  If you're new to long-term traveling those would be a good option to get you started because you meet lots of interesting people.  But after a while you kind of need your own space and living in a 20-bed dorm stops cutting it, regardless of how cool the people there are.<p>Since I rent rooms in apartments they usually have their own kitchens.  I cook for myself or go out with friends to eat.<p>The rent varies greatly from place to place.  I've been told by many that Munich is the most expensive city in Germany.  I rented a big room in a rather small apartment in a great part of town (next to Ostbahnhof)  for 150 euro a week with one roommate  That seems to be about the right price based on the other offers I found.  In Belgium, I lived in a small town just south of Brussels.  I rented a room from a retired couple who lived in a 3-story country house with a huge, beautiful garden and massive kitchen for 100 euro per week.  They were frequently gone so I had the house to myself.  In London there's a website called Gumtree that's like Craigslist.  I found a room for 160 pounds per week.  It was much harder finding a room in London than anywhere else because everything is outrageously expensive and everyone seems to want a minimum 6 month stay (I'm only here for 3 weeks).<p>In Belgium you can get a bottle of 12% Trappist for ~2 euro; in Germany a liter of beer for ~6 euro and a pint for ~3 euro; in England a pint for ~3 pounds.  Food at the grocery seemed cheapest in Germany, where I never found myself spending more than 15 euro in one visit that would last me a few days of eating well.<p>So, after you convert euros and pounds to dollars, you can see that it varies a lot.  In England in particular the conversion rate is killer--something like 1.6 dollars to a pound right now.<p>My advice would be if you really want to do some long term travel, just buy your ticket and do it.  It's really extremely easy to figure things out once you arrive somewhere.  You can email me at my username at ucla.edu if you want any more info.",1289825434

The problem I run into is that you have no idea what's going on on the production environment. Some characteristics are maybe reproducible on the dev site, but actual users will always do something differently. Sometimes not being able to poke the live system in a specific way while it's live, will cost you weeks of guessing in the dev environment.<p>Then again, there is no perfect solution for this, is there? If you tried installing new version with more debugging points, you'd be deploying something unstable over something previously unstable and trying to push more data out which might be problematic in itself.

Because, implicitly or explicitly, the patient has consented to being examined.<p>In accordance with a medically necessitated test. If a gynecologist is sticking a finger in a womans vagina, whether s/he has implicit or explicit consent is sexual assault if performed under misinformation.<p>If a doctor gropes my testicles or sticks a finger up my ass without medical justification for doing so, it is sexual asault.<p>Given that the 'pat down' is the least effective screening procedure in an airport, it has very little reason to be performed for the reasons given. The real reason the pat downs are performed is to find drugs concealed on the body.<p>Why is a pat down used, when a dog can more easily be used with less harassment of passengers and more verifiability in courts. Bloodhound evidence is permissible in all courts (IIRC) generally without any question because of the safe guards. The bloodhound <i>will</i> detect if you have an illicit substance on you, even if it is in an unverifiable quantity by an officer. If you aren't actually carrying, you won't be arrested as you're not prosecutable. So why isn't this used? Mostly because a bloodhound isn't intimidating to people who know they won't be busted.<p>Airline security is designed to add pressure, to make people feel nervous because people with a reason to be nervous simply walking past an officer will be panicking. This allows them to catch all the one-time mules who are doing it out of desperation, it may also work on amateur (AKA idiot) terrorists.<p>However, as we can see the 9/11 terrorists all managed to board a plane without panicking or looking suspicious, because they are all believed to have received paramilitary or military training. These trainings inevitably involve keeping calm under duress. Normally military training involves mock interrogations to train the soldier to withstand questioning and thus keep them calm about the risk of being questioned.",1289824545

Those are really fast and reliable. The only reason I would use disks (whether SSDs or spinning metal) would be for speed. If, say, a storage box has 200 servers hanging from it and all 200 decide to go nuts with disk access you won't be able to sustain anything near 76 MBps per box.<p>As for the storage boxes themselves, they usually employ piles of ECC RAM, specialized network and disk controllers, SSDs, fast and small disks, larger and slower disks and keep moving data around trying to guess the optimal positioning to give you the best possible performance under your varying workload.

I'm talking about full-sentence-like-function-names-without-any-abbreviations.

But still long names do hurt <i>reading</i> the code! My brain seems to visually reject code with such names. Add Clojure's type annotations esp. in java-interop code and there's quite a mess on screen.. so i have to read the code carefully sexp by sexp instead of grasping it with a quick glance like in Ruby..<p>Maybe it's time to try Arc it seems much more succint :]",1276123856

Storing indiscriminately may be careless, but it <i>is</i> easier to code. Also, store-it-all and analyze/carve/blind-it-later is far more in keeping with MapReduce/BigTable/etc data-mining ethos of a place like Google. So Google's explanation is more credible than Privacy International's speculation.<p>This doesn't absolve Google -- and the engineer(s) who wrote and deployed the code in question -- from all responsibility. An alarm should have gone off in someone's head -- ""collecting this data is problematic!"" But it's plausible one person wrote the best scanner they could, and then later another wrote the most comprehensive storage layer they could, and either no one understood the combined impact, or the only person(s) who did were especially obtuse/cavalier about privacy issues.

1418480,comment,1418001,1418326,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"Change the density and the swimmer's buoyancy will change.  Change the viscosity and the optimal swimming algorithm will change.  As you increase a liquid's viscosity, the swimmer loses its ability to coast on the inertia provided by previous effort.  At a high enough viscosity (given a swimmer of constant size and strength), it's as if the swimmer has no inertia.  The movement of the swimmer and fluid will be effectively a function of what forces the swimmer is putting on the fluid at that point in time, because any inertia will immediately get ""stolen"" by the fluid.<p>For example, scallops can swim in water, but with a high enough viscosity (or a microscopically sized scallop), their swimming style would get them nowhere.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scallop_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scallop_theorem</a> .  At high enough viscosities, the best way for a human to swim underwater would be to grow new skin on the scalp and reabsorb excess skin at the feet.<p>Viscous fluids are better at stealing the effort you've put in, so you're going to have a harder time swimming in them, unless you can find a good way to push yourself along without donating your velocity back to the fluid.",1276121703

695251,comment,692672,694852,0,0,anamax,,,">> And the relevance of [a local aw school] to startups is?<p>> It depends on how you define startup. If you are referring specifically to high tech startups, then the relevance is fairly small. If you use the term more generally for recently formed, small companies then many fields require immediate access to lawyers.<p>(1) Lawyers, yes, but you mentioned law school.  I've seen plenty of ""SV works because"" stories that mention law firms, but I don't think that I've ever seen one that mentioned Boalt (Berkeley) or Stanford Law.<p>(2) Why do tech startups have less need for a law school, or lawyers for that matter, than other kinds of startups?  (Generally speaking of course, as you were.)<p>Please be specific, because I don't see it.",1247115449

This is the first non-hyperbole analysis of Google's announcement I've seen today.<p>My bet is that Chrome OS  will have similar impact to the Chrome browser - encourage everyone to step up their game, but not dominate the market. Google has a lot of money and a lot of bright people, and it acts just like a bright person with little financial concerns: It toys with a lot of ideas, many of them brilliant, but rarely bothers to execute them fully. An OS takes years of frustrating, boring work to mature, I doubt Google has the focus for that.",1247114409

I realized I've always been ""unit testing"", in that my approach has usually been to write a bit of code, test it with a short main(), write a bit more, and so on.  Unit testing, when it feels natural, is no different.  I just keep the tests instead of throwing them out.  This is more of a parallel testing approach than a TDD, but it seems to lead to good code coverage.<p>The part where I start to feel like the benefit isn't worth the cost is when I feel like I'm unit testing a framework rather than my own code.",1247113897

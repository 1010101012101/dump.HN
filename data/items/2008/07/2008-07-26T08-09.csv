His initial posts (esp the ""Django for designers"" one) were one of the few in plain English and a great intro for me at the time, as a designer that had only worked with php and Rails. I've worked at two startups using Django since with very little time getting up to speed once it's up and running but he's right that it's still a bit of a bear to install, especially locally.",1217061114

In limited studies, Intuits score higher than Native Americans from Central America. 60,000 years is actually quite a long time, and the skills necessary to survive harsh northern winters are very different than those needed to survive in tropical jungles.<p>Hpw about Ashkenazi Jews, whom have the highest IQ and yet do not originate from a high latitude?",1217059378

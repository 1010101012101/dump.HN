There are 1,048,576 bytes in a megabyte,  so that's 1 million/140 = 7490 text messages to transmit one megabyte. At 5p each, that's £374.49 per MB - or about 4.4 times more expensive than the ‘most pessimistic’ estimate for Hubble Space Telescope transmission costs.""",1221154954

It may even have been made worse by Vista; if machine sales were lousy due to Vista, OEMs had to make a buck any way they could.<p>- ""he conceded that Apple appeals to more and more consumers because the hardware is slick, the price is OK, and Apple doesn’t annoy its customers (or allow third parties to)""<p>Somewhat true statements about Apple, though Apple <i>has</i> annoyed its customers, and 3rd parties such as Adobe have incredibly obnoxious customer-annoying things even in their Mac software.<p>But I think Microsoft needs to identify more significant reasons for Apple's appeal.

No matter where he goes it's basically going to be the same.<p>If you look at the work place as it exists in the US, or many other countries for that matter, there is a fairly defined and constant relationship between the company and the employee.  There are those companies that try to break the mold and have a different relationship, but for the most part it's fairly constant across companies and industries.<p>As company size increases the number of people in management also tends to increase and the upper management   tends to become more and more removed from the people who are actually working with the customers and writing the code or doing the real work.  The people making the big decisions know less about the situation than the guy on the front lines hence the large number of problems that arise that are satirized in the Dilbert comics.",1221153294

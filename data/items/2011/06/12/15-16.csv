I even ran Ubuntu as my main OS for about 3 months until there was something I needed to do that wouldn't run under Wine. It worked ""ok"".<p>- I needed to reboot it 3 or 4 times a day because the sound would just stop working for no reason I was ever able to resolve.<p>- I could never get it to use the native resolution of my monitors. I suspect it was driver issues with my perfectly normal nvidia card.<p>- Video playback, flash, etc. all ran unacceptably slow.<p>To be honest, I'm willing to accept that not everything will ""just work"" perfectly out of the box. But if it takes me longer than a 2 or 3 hours to resolve a minor issue, I'm done.<p>One thing that still befuddles me to this day is the plethora of perfectly earnest looking GUI configuration odds and ends in Ubuntu which seem to have virtually no effect. Anything that I was able to resolve had to be done by opening up an xterm and editing some config file someplace (which usually wasn't in the place pointed to by most of the online help I could find).<p>I'm honestly interested in what problems people have under Windows or OS X that drives them to Linux. I hear a lot about insurmountable issues with these OSs, hardware that won't work or whatever. But I've almost never had an issue I couldn't resolve by downloading the correct driver for the device, clicking setup.exe and rebooting. The few times I couldn't it was because the hardware was bad.<p>(though there was one time I was trying to get bluetooth to work on a laptop I had, I did the above, but it borked the machine and I got a bluescreen. 30 minutes of googling gave me the magic incantations to fix it and get me back up and running...turns out the laptop was one of the submodels that didn't actually have bluetooth hardware...meh)<p>Now finding the drivers can sometimes be hard, especially if the hardware is oddball or very old.",1307894372

You are asked to do things you have never done or have little experience in. There is a constant need to monitor and watch the development as the needs and the support required change over time. And whether you have only raised one child or several, as a serial entrepreneur or serial parent, each is uniquely different one child to the next, one startup to the next.

2646633,comment,2645533,2646474,2,0,mechanical_fish,,,"My take is that it's just too early in biotech. Back in 1973 it was certainly possible to envision Facebook and Twitter. For example, if you read Steven Levy's <i>Hackers</i> you'll learn about the Community Memory project:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Memory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Memory</a><p>But computers and their associated tech like telecom were so expensive in 1973 that Community Memory was impractical at scale. There was no Facebook around to offer Lee Felsenstein an enormous salary and a potential IPO. The infrastructure wasn't yet built out, the audience wasn't yet there, and investor consciousness had not yet been raised. It took another twenty years of development to get from that point to the Web, and then another decade or so to get to Facebook.<p>Biotech is still stuck in the equivalent of 1973. We've identified many of the processes that need to become cheaper and more ubiquitous in order to conduct biotech research in your basement, but the tools are still large, expensive, and tedious to use. So at this point if you go into biotech you'll either spend 12 hours a day pipetting liquids by hand, waiting for the PCR machine, and pasting your data into Excel for analysis, or you'll spend 12 hours a day raising money to pay for the pipettes, the PCR machine, and the other scientists who are running them.<p>I've spent years as a biotech postdoc, and I've spent years as a programmer, and it's no mystery to me why people would rather be programmers, and would rather hire programmers. The day-to-day work is more pleasant, and the results have got such evident and immediate value that you can get good pay for them with relatively little effort or risk.

Neither will attempting to adhere to a ""Functional"" style when you've not already learned the important lessons of FP from an actually FP-oriented language. Coding guidelines? Be consistent. Discover the guidelines of the code you're working on and use that. That has nothing to do with python or proficiency.<p>Performance is probably the last part of proficiency that one has to learn, and arguably the most difficult. A lot of other skills have to come together before one can count ""performance"" as a point of their proficiency in a language, and most of those skills are really quite language-agnostic. Oh, and if you're focusing on performance but you don't yet know how to properly profile and benchmark, you're <i>not</i> proficient.<p>If you really want to become a proficient Python programmer (or any other language) try this:<p>1. Find the documentation<p>2. Learn how to navigate, search, and read the documentation<p>3. Find a skilled mentor or some community resource (IRC, mailing-list, website forums, etc)<p>4. Ask what is considered good code. Read it. Study it.<p>5. Create a project - little ones, like sorting your MP3 collection or mining your email for statistics.<p>6. Try to use the lessons learned in the code you've studied when writing your project.<p>7. lather, rinse, repeat.

Every issue I had was literally a major configuration issue. I spent those 3 days with my MBP sitting next to me so I could look up help in various forums.<p>By comparison, I wiped the drive, installed Windows XP, most of it was spent waiting for the files to copy, I had a thumb drive with 4 drivers on it. After install I clicked setup.exe for each driver, rebooted a handful of times. Clicked each drive I wanted to share and set it to ""share"" and that system is still up and running...I think I've rebooted it 3 times since then. Total time spent? 90 minutes.<p>So if ""it"" is wasting a bunch of my time for absolutely nothing in return? I can't think of any other area in my life where I would allow that kind of user experience.<p>Imagine this was a car, and I had to rebuild the engine or the shifter nob or pedals or windshield or whatever just to drive it off the lot, and then I'd find out it wasn't compatible with every road I wanted to go on, unless I patched it with a different windshield, but when I did that the a/c stopped working. And the brake pedal would stop activating the brake system every 6 hours unless I turned the car off and restarted the engine. Bringing in my car for an oil change might make the doors or wheels stop working.<p>I have pretty low expectations of technology. I don't expect things to ""just work"", but I do expect to have a couple pretty clear lines to resolve any issues, even if I have to get my hands dirty and change the spark plugs myself.<p>So if this is ""it"", no thanks.",1307892046

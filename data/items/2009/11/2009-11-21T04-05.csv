Once you've done a few startups, you'll realize that choosing a partner, or partners, could easily make or break you. Partnerships are easy to get into, the good ones are easy to get out of, the bad ones are impossible to shake off.<p>From your post, it sounds like you're worried about getting this guy ""in"" with you. If you've got the idea, and are driving it, you offer something very few people do, don't give it up on the first date! You might hate this guy, or he might hate you. OR, he might want something you can't offer.<p>I'm still learning about this myself, but have in the last year or two begun to strongly prefer trial-period type situations, ones that could last a while. We recently invited to people to join our board, and they are on one-year probationary terms. They were happy to join on those terms because they want to help.<p>I'm happy to try them out, without worrying about giving them equity now that might be the wrong amount later.<p>I could say a lot more about this, but I think overall to find a partner in the very early stage, you should generally: pitch the IDEA and business hard, be cagey  about promising equity participation, and make CERTAIN that the person will be able to contribute by asking them to contribute for free, or cheap first.",1258778612

There were other variables though, strength of the current, wind, how intense our hangovers were... so it's hard to attribute it to just the different arrangements.  I will say that sitting in an arrangement where the guy in front/behind has his oar on the same side as you leaves very little room for error.

He's trying to capitalize on his name.<p>I assume you're not pressed for cash. The $14k you would get by PG/YC buying in is a drop in the bucket compared to the $1m you've already earned.

954166,comment,954087,954087,0,0,netcan,,,"Perhaps it might be useful for you to think of a business broker as an analogy.<p>A broker takes 5%-10% of a deal. They can charge that much because clients with the broker they can get more then 5%-10% more on the sale. In residential real estate, it's the same sort of idea with smaller percentage.<p>There are two numbers that mark the top & bottom limit for any price. One is the maximum buyer would pay if he had no alternatives. In a business environment this equals the total amount of return he gets for it. The second number is the minimum a seller would accept, this is usually cost of production.<p>In a competitive market, the price is usually close to the second number. We are used to prices being like that in our normal lives as consumers.<p>In a broker situation, the price has less to do with the second number & more to do with the first, the value to the customer.<p>You need to figure out if what YC has to offer is worth 7% of your company. If we assume that your goal is an exit, this could be making an exit ultimately happen more quickly, at a higher value or more likely. It doesn't actually need to be that much higher, faster or more likely to be worth 10% of your company. YC might be getting an awesome bargain, but that doesn't mean you loose.",1258777450

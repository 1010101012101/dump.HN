That is why so many people work in small (inefficient) shops. Closed shop regulation for many professions lock people out of high wage occupations. Next to Portugal's 28% high school graduation rate [1] Greece's recent progress (<50% of 25-64 year olds completing high school in 1997 versus 61% today [2]) is valiant but the leaves an uneducated, unproductive generation untouched. It also doesn't account for Greeks' shorter working years.<p>2. <i>Doing business is tough</i>. Here is an anecdote from a financial commentator in Athens:<p>""My friend explained that the owner of the bookstore/caf couldnt get a license to providecoffee. She had tried to just buy a coffee machine and give the coffee away for free, thinking that lingering patrons would boost book sales. However, giving away coffee was illegal as well. Instead, the owner had to strike a deal with a bar across the street, whereby they make the coffee and the waitress spends all day shuttling between the bar and the bookstore/caf. My friend also explained to me that books could not be purchased at the bookstore, as it was after 18h and it is illegal to sell books in Greece beyond that hour. I was in a bookstore/caf that could neither sell books nor make coffee.""

3970811,comment,3967921,3967921,1,0,habeanf,,,"I volunteer at the Public Knowledge Foundation (an Israeli version of The Sunlight Foundation), we develop and maintain oknesset.org (like opencongress.org). For the past couple months we've been researching the possibility of representing Israeli law as a git repository, so that oknesset.org can visualize the diff to a law a bill proposal represents, and track it as a branch until it is merged into law. Since Israel is a relatively young and small country the number of laws and changes is orders of magnitude smaller than most western/democratic countries which publicize the legislative process. Israel's legislative branch is unicameral so the process itself is relatively straightforward; supposedly we'd be a good test case. We already have quite a lot of insight but in general it seems that git (and generally, any VCS) has significant impedance mismatch with the legislative process, specifically regarding the ability to compile/link all the different laws into one comprehensive database representing the law. One prominent example is the existence of multiple timelines of ratification. There are at least three dates relevant to the ratification of bills:<p>1. Date of third (and final) vote = the date the parliament has voted a bill as law<p>2. Date of publication (for technical reasons this might not coincide with the vote date)<p>3. Date of validity - a bill is usually passed with a date of validity, between the date of publication and validity the bill is not formally law yet.  Sometimes there are separate dates of validity for separate parts of the bill.  To make matters more complicated, dates of validity can be changed when the bill designates government ministers with the authority to change them (the dates).<p>Also, in Israel many laws never ""make it"" to their date of validity since the yearly Law of Arrangements (<a href=""http://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/hesderim_eng.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/hesderim_eng.htm</a>) decides which laws passed in the previous year have proper funding, such that officially some laws get ""punted"" into the future, possibly indefinitely. It gets quite confusing because from a legal point of view, the dates that are relevant to the justice system (as in, when a bill is relevant or not to the court) are usually the date of voting, whereas when it comes to government the third date is the important one.<p>We are still moving forward with our initiative, but it seems that for now there are no version control systems which are a good solution to the law management problem.<p>(edited for formatting)",1337000116

3970809,comment,3965588,3968379,2,0,dsrguru,,,"I strongly disagree.  The vast majority of Racket code I've looked at would be far easier to translate into, say, Common Lisp than Haskell (or Erlang, which is probably a more illustrative example since it has dynamic typing).  Emacs Lisp is pretty different because it doesn't have lexical scoping and it's only really used in the Emacs runtime environment (although it resembles Common Lisp syntactically), but programs written in Racket, Common Lisp, and Clojure (and other LISP dialects that support lexical scoping and macros) tend to be way more similar to each other than are programs written in Racket and languages we traditionally think of as functional.  If you're still not convinced, I'm sure a bit of digging online would reveal way more crossover between Racket and other LISP dialects by the same developers than you get with Haskell or ML developers crossing over to Racket.<p>As for your parenthetical add-on, I'm not bashing LISPs at all.  I think Racket is a beautiful language, in part precisely because it has the power of a LISP dialect.  As for your second point, using the capitalized form is the only unambiguous word that refers to the family because many developers in the Common Lisp community use Lisp to mean CL.  The reddit style ""do yourself a favor"" and ill-formed judgments about people's ""limited knowledge"" are way less constructive than asking ""why did you use that spelling.""

As far as naming convnetion goes, that might bite you sometimes when you are just starting, but use generators and ""do as what is already done"" and you will be good.<p>Common Lisp has its niceties - generally produces fast code, some abstractions are better done with macros etc. But for now, when compared to Rails for a regular CRUD app, it isn't going to look good.

It's amazing just how quickly someone that age can go from a physically and mentally alert person to death.<p>The root cause of all that is ageing. Your grandfather is certainly the exception.

Yes, sometimes young people suffer from these, but they're exceedingly rare.

Unless what you mean by ""a class instance"" is ""a class object"". A factory method is a classmethod, not an instancemethod.<p>A factory method and a ""factory constructor"" need exactly the same thing: the class object.<p>> In dart, there is real decoupling going on.<p>In dart, there's mostly a bloody mess of 4 different constructors when all you need is a constructor and an initializer, as done in e.g. Ruby or Python. And these can be ""regular"" methods (respectively on the class and on the instance).<p>Conversely, you can also have an ""overridden"" constructor as in Javascript: an instance is built, the constructor function is called using the instance as its context, and if the constructor returns something that something is returned by `new` in stead of the original object.",1336998204

For me, it was reading the section on procrastination (which requires reading the preceding sections on dysfunctional thought patterns) in David Burns' ""Feeling Good"" that did the job.<p>Once you see all the possible reasons people procrastinate listed in front of you, and a plan of action for each scenario, it's pretty difficult to procrastinate because every time you find yourself in a potential procrastination scenario your brain goes ""oh hang on, I know what I'm doing, it's X from <i>Feeling Good</i>"".  At that point you can execute the anti-procrastination plan, or, as in my present case, I don't even bother any more because I've done it enough to know I'll invariably end up getting to work and so I just go right ahead and do it.<p>The key thing here is you need to (a) be committed to change and (b) you need to study the book and do the exercises.  Refreshing my procrastination pattern matching memory from time to time by rereading the section is critical.  Many people aren't ready to stop procrastinating because they're not ready to take action.  But just like debugging code, you just have to follow the chain of dependencies until you deal with successive root causes.  Prochaska's ""Changing for Good"" put me on the path of awareness in this regard.  Once you know what your brain is doing it's pretty difficult <i>not</i> to make progress.",1336998091

Maybe, if they had ""skin in the game"", they'd be more inclined to be more responsible in their lending.<p>Or maybe the answer comes in capping the amount that can be paid back on amounts given, so that after paying for $x for $y borrowed, or paying for Z years, it doesn't matter how much you have left (thanks to compound interest), the debt is considered ""paid"".<p>Either way, loans will be harder to get, yes. Fewer people will be able to afford school at its current prices. Schools will have to make a choice of cutting back significantly, or trying to cater to those students who can't afford loans that would have paid for Ivy league schools. Community colleges will have to be community colleges again, vocational schools vocational.<p>I do know that currently, schools don't care where the money comes from, and lenders (and guarantors) don't really care where it goes to, and each loan that is too much for the borrower to pay back essentially becomes a money printing press. We keep paying, and many keep going further in debt to them.<p>Our system now can not last forever. A quick Google tells me that in the past 35 years, tuition has risen >900%. That number will continue to balloon as large as possible, until there is reason for it to stop. Maybe those alternative education models Cuban mentions vaguely (we probably know well what we means), but maybe this is what changes it. Allowing bankruptcy.<p>As long as possible, schools will continue to take as much money as they can get, to offer more, and bigger. And so far, lenders/guarantors seem content to let every person take that loan, and put a noose around their necks, as we've been told since we were children ""go to school, do well, go to college, do well, you will do well in life"". And as much as people here may value independent drive and self-teaching, I think we can agree that ""the system"" very much encourages people to attempt a college degree.<p>At least when the multi-billion dollar banks got into trouble, they had two options: go bankrupt and strike a deal with those they owed, or get bailed out. People only have one, ""keep paying."" And at some point, that just becomes indentured servitude.",1336996841

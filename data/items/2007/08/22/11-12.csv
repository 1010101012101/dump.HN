How to organize them?<p>there has to be a better way of doing this than just plain tags.  can't be social (yet) since the pdf's are copyright and should only sit on your hardrive.  maybe some stored routines that search all /references/ for keywords and sticky notes on the pdf etc etc",1187783897

You said mod_perl2, MySQL and Apache2 weren't cutting it for you, but I've scaled to that level fine with mod_perl2, PostgreSQL and Apache2.  The key was database pooling via Apache::DBI, all the perl modules cached in a startup.pl via mod_perl2, keep alive and host lookups (and a few other things) completely off in Apache2, and all queries using indexes and indexes all in memory via postgres.<p>Early on, like in your situation, I did go to the file system at first because I couldn't ""make it work,"" but then eventually I went back to postgres after I figured out its scalability details.  If you have a lot of little files and you hit them a lot, that will eventually probably become your bottleneck.  Did you figure out the bottleneck in your db setup or has there just not been enough time yet?  Just curious.",1187783535

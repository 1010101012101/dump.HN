There&#x27;s nothing wrong with a DHE cipher suite and it can be used in a secure manner quite easily. Since this is wholly on the server, and howsmyssl has no way of testing a server you&#x27;re connecting to, then there&#x27;s no possible way for it to know if your specific connections are okay or not.

But I do think ad&#x27;s can be done tastefully and in a way that benefits all involved.<p>Imagine if HN had a link at the top for advertisements, and they had a policy that anyone with > x amount of karma could pay $y to have a listing for z days. It would be reminiscent of the ad&#x27;s in the back of old computer magazines, with people selling home made software, tools, and services.<p>Another example, would be if a music venue paid local record shops to have a prominent display of upcoming shows in their store, and on their website.   How could that be anything but useful?<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not selling anything, and I avoid ad&#x27;s as much as possible.

10401951,comment,10400678,10401851,0,0,themodelplumber,,,"It&#x27;s been a while, but if it helps, I divided my research into different categories, like the signs that you&#x27;d expect from an organization using brainwashing techniques, the objective signs that you&#x27;d expect in a leader or leadership team using brainwashing, and the objective signs of someone affected by brainwashing.<p>Using #2 as an example, some people assume that because an organization has a publicly-visible leader, that person calls the shots (edit for clarity: when in fact the organization may rely most on local councils, etc. and not so much on the figurehead). That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to be clear on one&#x27;s own status--outsider or insider. This was a huge research boon for me. That clarification results in a better idea of your own biases, and also gives you an idea of the way your opposites (outsiders if you&#x27;re an insider) may be getting their information or education.<p>It is extremely easy to get one&#x27;s own subjective thinking caught up in this, no matter what your position. For example, some frequently-listed signs of brainwashing are &quot;emotional attachment&quot; and &quot;dependency.&quot; Not very helpful in some hopefully obvious ways; these terms are practically plug-n-play with confirmation bias. On the other hand, it _could_ be helpful information if you developed a set of criteria. Some have tried, as I recall. Nothing scientific because you essentially end up typologizing.<p>The other rather frightening thing was learning about government-sponsored anti-cult movements, like the fairly recent movement in Russia. TBH, the whole thing was pretty jacked up, and I cut it short when I started reading about possibly innocent people getting locked up in psych wards. Another surprising &quot;anti-cult&quot; force commonly listed is the media, and this seems like it could hold true at least to the degree that a news outlet is willing to sensationalize vs. provide solid reporting (then you get into what is solid reporting, etc.). After researching that, IMO if you&#x27;re getting cult information from the media, it&#x27;s a good idea to remind yourself that it&#x27;s not the same as doing your own research, no matter what the facts are about the organization in question.",1445028901

10401940,comment,10401416,10401416,0,0,nbadg,,,"This was a great article OP. But I think the author misses two critical points.<p>Privacy and secrecy, in my mind, are questions of agency. In this context we&#x27;re talking about information. You can, broadly speaking, only do three things with information: create it, retain it, and share it. If you&#x27;re to have agency -- that is, the ability to independently control your own existence -- in a digital sense, that implies that you must be able to control those three things. And if you think about it in terms of actual physical speech, it seems so intuitive: it would be an extraordinary day indeed if there were widespread physical manipulation of the very words coming out of our mouths, if somehow some third party could magically eavesdrop at will over anything we speak. But we&#x27;ve acclimated ourselves to thinking of digital spaces as somehow separate, as if the perceived triviality of, say, instagramming food pics might also imply that there is any less of a violation of our personal agency. That, for me, is why &quot;private-by-default&quot; is and always has been so vital: without it, you&#x27;re incapable of exercising any meaningful control over the digital world around you. I&#x27;m always sad to see this framing left out, because I think it&#x27;s a very important perspective to have.<p>The second, and likely more appropriate point (given that this is HN), is that this isn&#x27;t just economics and geopolitics. It is a technical failure that allowed third parties to have any control over it in the first place. HTTP doesn&#x27;t even protect security, much less privacy. HTTPS is a step forward, but if you think it&#x27;s sufficient in protecting privacy, I would offer Facebook as a counterexample. Protection of data in transit is an insufficient condition for privacy, and therefore an insufficient condition for agency. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to create a protocol to address this, to afford not just security but agency, and I am absolutely positive that there are people out there working on this (I know, because I&#x27;m one of them: <a href=""https://github.com/Muterra/doc-muse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Muterra/doc-muse</a>). But the hard part is overcoming the inertia we already have, and on that front, we are indeed back to economics and politics.",1445028768

There have already been a number of real-world stories where people used DNA in unexpected (and legally questionable) ways to identify people or relationships, including using family members&#x27; DNA as a starting point.<p>There&#x27;s also already some research with positive results about deanonymizing DNA:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/262.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/262.short</a><p><a href=""https://petsymposium.org/2015/papers/07_Humbert.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://petsymposium.org/2015/papers/07_Humbert.pdf</a><p>The former is based on trying to use known data about family relationships to figure out who someone could be, while the latter is based on trying to figure out what someone would look like (or what other observable properties they could have) based on their DNA and then recognize them in a database of anonymous DNA samples.<p>While both of these studies have pretty significant constraints on the ability to do this kind of deanonymization in a general way for large databases, I think the power of DNA deanonymization will only grow as DNA databases and publicly available family tree records get larger, and as people learn to predict more and more phenotypic traits from a DNA sequence.",1445028366

In order to maintain public support and politic capital, NASA has to do some really stupid things that they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise need to. SpaceX doesn&#x27;t have to deal with public perception like NASA does because insurance companies and customers dealing with space are much smarter about the cost benefit.<p>For example (citation needed but these are ballpark numbers I remember from a JPL study), if you have $500 million for a mission like NuSTAR, one that must succeed because of its scientific significance, you have to spend that money to get a 95% success probability (for the primary mission duration). You can build and launch the satellite for $250 million with an 80% probability of success (and launch two) or launch one with a 95% chance for $500 million because that last 15% has rapidly diminishing returns on capital invested. The former has a 4% chance of both failing, 64% chance of both succeeding, and 32% chance of at least one succeeding.<p>However, after half a century NASA has found that what matters is the absolute number of failures, not number of successful missions or success rate. It&#x27;s absurd, but NASA gets more funding when it successfully launches 4 out of 5 missions than if it launches 8 out of 10 <i>for the exact same cost.</i> This  means that the two satellites for $250 million option has a one in three chance of at least one failure andh could easily cost NASA $500 million or so for another scientifically critical mission, <i>even if one satellite makes it and the mission is successful</i>.<p>It gets even worse when you factor in all of the pork barrel politics going into the NASA budget. Because NASA has operations and vendors in so many districts, in order for the timing and logistics to work out in the above example, they&#x27;d have to spend closer to $300-$400 million per satellite, wait many years between launch attempts, or build both satellites at the same time and waste everything but the launch cost (only $50-100 million) in the 80% scenario where the first satellite makes.<p>NASA has technical and political debt just like any fast moving 50+ year old organization but it is still a lean mean fighting machine that accomplishes milestones for our civilization on an annual basis. It&#x27;s our political system that&#x27;s bloated.",1445028352

The good part is that often we can increase the difficulty to crack something by an order of magnitude without a high cost to us.",1445027810

I am grateful to be fortunate enough to understand how we technically implement these levels of trust in our tools and feel it is part of my social responsibility to share my views on these matters with my peers. I don&#x27;t believe in allowing criminals to break laws, but I also feel that making things less secure by <i>trying</i> to monitor everyone for criminal activity is not the answer because I also think it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive to eliminate all criminal activity. Maybe that makes me hysterical...but at least I don&#x27;t speak for others.<p>I made ZERO blaming statements in my comment. I asserted that, from what I understand of the parent article, we have reason to suspect the government has cracked, or has the ability to crack, large primes. We know for a fact that a lot of software uses the default primes, so the logic goes that the government has the ability to monitor a portion of what we would normally consider secure SSL traffic. That individuals have little way of mitigating this &quot;venerability&quot; is an important one here because it may depend on us working together to determine the attack coverage and exposure. Without knowing those things, we&#x27;re really at a loss to what could possibly going on with monitoring.<p>I will also point out that, if those cracked prime solutions exist, they will eventually fall into the wrong hands.",1445027411

The fact that the language is a list (which is the same data structure that you use to manipulate value) is what makes it that powerful. Once you start adding more syntax, then it&#x27;s not a list anymore.. so you can&#x27;t just pass that code to your macro and it becomes trickier.<p>For instance, you could receive your AST, manipulate and return it, but now you&#x27;re getting into implementation detail about how the lexer and parser are working. Compare that with lisp where you get a list and you return a list. The fact that your code <i>is</i> your AST is that makes it so magical.<p>I understand that the lisp syntax can throw someone off guard when they&#x27;re used to seeing obj-c or javascript. But honestly, it&#x27;s much simpler and easier to get to than, say, get familiar with C++ if you&#x27;re a java programmer.<p>One problem that I see with Lisp is that since everything looks the same, it&#x27;s hard to quickly parse it when reading a file. I feel like reading a Python file is really fast because it&#x27;s separated in classes / method, or even the methods are clearly separated in &quot;paragraph&quot;. While in lisp, everything has the same syntax and to know what&#x27;s happening you need to read almost every line. Basically, I feel like it&#x27;s lacking visual clue. Clojure fixes that a little bit by adding a few more data structure.<p>The other problem that I see with Lisps are that code abusing lambdas is hard to follow. I.e. In python, lambda are used for very short functions. But in Lisp, most people nest lambda in lambda in lambdas and often don&#x27;t even use good variable names or variable name at all. Lisp code feels &quot;write-only&quot; to me. That being said, this is more of a mentality than a language problem because it&#x27;s easy to define internal functions rather than nesting everything. Similar to how javascript can be one giant pack of nested functions or well defined functions with good variable names.<p></ end of rant.<p>All that being said, I think Arc (And other lisps) are amazing and I&#x27;m sad that they&#x27;re not more popular.",1445027120

If your grind is too fine, then it will block the machine and you&#x27;ll get a bitter extraction.<p>Again, this isn&#x27;t a subtle thing. If you&#x27;ve had a real espresso machine (one that has a pump that applies the proper pressure) then it immediately becomes obvious that you need a consistent grind that you can adjust.<p>The variable you track is generally the length of the extraction, ie, how long it takes to get an ounce or an ounce and a half of espresso for a given amount of time. (aiming for 16-22 seconds or so) Too fine a grind and you&#x27;ll block it up and you&#x27;ll never get the oz, too coarse and it will all come out too quickly.

I had a manager who would give us arbitrary, ridiculously short deadlines, then expect us to work all hours to meet them.  I was listening to suicide-y music.  The breaking point was when I got my bonus; it was less than half of what I had been promised.<p>When I hit that burnout point, I took 2 weeks off and went to a remote place with no internet.  I drank heavily the first couple of days (I think of it as a mental-reset).  And then I started analyzing what made me burn out.  I realized that for me it was a combination of two things: Time, and Talent.  I was spending too much time at work, and I was working with supremely untalented people.  I also realized that I had a good amount of experience under my belt, and that I was fairly desirable as an employee.<p>Armed with that knowledge I went back to work, and started saying &quot;no&quot;.  I also started interviewing (I&#x27;m not stupid).<p>> No, I&#x27;m not staying late tonight.  No, I&#x27;m not staying late tomorrow night.  I&#x27;ve got arrangements.  What am I doing?

I made it clear to my manager that I enjoyed what I was doing, but I had a handful of open offers at a higher rate.  My manager backed down for a bit.  We started a new project, it was done later than his demand, but before my estimate.  And it was the most stable project we&#x27;d built.  After that I never felt like he was judging me again.<p>Eventually I did move on, and at every job since then it&#x27;s been about setting expectations on day one.  I do not work evenings or weekends (unless it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m genuinely excited about).  I do not run errands for other people.  I do not fix other people&#x27;s bugs or document their code just because they think they&#x27;re too important to (of course I work with other people&#x27;s code, I&#x27;m just not their bug bitch).<p>It&#x27;s been 9 years and I haven&#x27;t felt burnout-y since.

Sitting closer to a smaller 4k screen will give you a better experience than the big badly dimmed screen at the movies. A good pair of quality headphones ($300+) will also sound better than the often too loud sound system in the cinema. I can also set my own EQ and add sound compression to movies where the music, dialogs and special effect are badly balanced.<p>As for the snacks, they charge double or triple the price of everywhere else on the planet.<p>The only reason I go to a theater is out of nostalgia.

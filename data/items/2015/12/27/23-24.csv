When a corporation has a monopoly it&#x27;s as powerful as a government in that area but with zero accountability or transparency.<p>The concern here is power. The people in government choosing how to use their power are elected or responsible to someone elected. On the other hand the power structure of a corporation is a dictatorship. Pretending you can theoretically choose to not participate in society and avoid corporate control so their power isn&#x27;t real power is naive.",1451260775

The Gross-Zagier formula (along with work of Kolyvagin) from the 1980s proved the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture when &quot;r_an <= 1&quot;; this conjecture is an amazing link between analysis and arithmetic, and also one of  the Clay Problems.  This number &quot;r_an&quot; is the order of vanishing of a certain &quot;generating function&quot; that counts the number of solution to y^2 = x^3 + A<i>x + B modulo all prime numbers.   For about 30 years now, people have been completely stumped at coming up with even a wishy-washy conjectural half </i>guess* as to what to do when r_an is 2 or larger.   In number theory a standard approach is to replace the integers Z = {... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} with a polynomial ring F_p[X] over finite field, and try to solve analogous problems (this is called working &quot;over a functional field&quot;).  The paper that this article is about has come up with exactly what to do in case r_an is 2 or larger in the function field setting.   So far they haven&#x27;t figured out how to do anything over the rational numbers yet.  Sometimes solving a problem over function fields provides incredible and valuable insight into how to solve the analogous problem over the rational numbers, and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t (e.g., the function field analogue of Fermant&#x27;s Last Theorem and the ABC conjecture are both basically trivial to deal with, whereas the same problem over the rational numbers is ridiculously hard).",1451258289

In the 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s, crime skyrocketed. It went up so much that even though by the 1990&#x27;s the incarceration rate had quadrupled, the rise in incarceration did not even catch up with the rise in crime until 1998. On the back of that rise in crime, there was a corresponding hardening of the justice system. The war on drugs, elimination of parole, etc.<p>Crime has dropped dramatically since the peak in the mid-1990&#x27;s. But that massive build-up of the justice system has persisted, and today the incarceration rate dramatically exceeds the crime rate.

Mind you, there&#x27;s already a lot of innovation happening in supply chain systems but economical 1 hr to 1 day consumer delivery hasn&#x27;t had any real breakthroughs.<p>Now that may be because people aren&#x27;t willing to shoulder the cost for most mainstream use cases.

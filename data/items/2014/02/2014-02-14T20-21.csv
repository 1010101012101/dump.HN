It&#x27;s just as flexible and general as, say, Unix pipes but better because there are guarantees of the library&#x27;s tooling and there are guarantees of the programs you produce! You can&#x27;t say that in Node / JS, Python, Ruby, etc...<p>JS&#x27;s lack of strong typing limits your ability to reason about streams (a lot more than just streams, too) and further limits your ability to write performant stream computing software. Pipes, in Haskell, give you the big three: Effects (I/O), Composition (function composition with fusion), and Streams (generators and iteratees); because of the type system Haskell (and some nudges here and there by the library author) can fuse and optimize that code to a ridiculous degree in addition to all of the other nice guarantees you get from the type system (separate of I/O from pure code, etc...)<p>I personally don&#x27;t think dynamic typing is a selling point, ever - I write software faster and with fewer bugs in Haskell than I ever have before in Python, Ruby, Erlang, or Scheme. But that&#x27;s a totally different topic and I don&#x27;t want to derail this one.<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand me as being aggressive, please. I fully respect what people decide to like and work on, I&#x27;m just trying to expand the awareness that there are tools in existence that <i>do it better</i>.",1392411559

My last name is extremely rare; less than 20 people in the world have it.<p>As such, I am completely unable to maintain any level of anonymity in the world today.  It&#x27;s trivial to find anything I&#x27;ve been up to by using Google or Bing.  You can even see my entire family and what they&#x27;ve been up to and there&#x27;s no doubt they&#x27;re my family because my last name is so rare.<p>I seriously considered changing my last name to Smith.  I think it&#x27;s better to have nefarious people drown in a sea of false positives than it is to give them pinpoint accuracy directly to me (as I have today) or few enough false positives (as Stephen Law has) that they catch a lot of innocent people in their wide net.<p>I actually know some people with the Smith last name.  Every time they buy a house, the title insurance company provides them a list of deadbeats with their exact same name and they simply sign a form saying, &quot;Not me&quot; and their transaction continues.<p>Imagine if they wanted to put John Smith or Joseph Brown on the OFAC list.

Ok the salt part is a joke but seriously, one has to feel for those who share their names with people on these &quot;special&quot; lists by Governments.<p>May be a start-up idea for prospective parents to run the names and ensure that before they name their babies, those are not on some list. But then what if someone gets on the list later on ? So it seems like a very unique name is really the option.<p>Also, do these special lists really flag people just by their names ? really ? I mean how many John Smiths can there be in this world and god forbid if one of them decides to do something &quot;special&quot;. What about other attributes ? Is it really hard to have the unique key as (first name,last name, gender, age, place of birth, citizenship, blah blah) instead of just (first name, last name) and boom, you are flagged.<p>EDIT: Based on some comments, it might be a good idea to have a legal name that is very unique and a social name/nickname  that is the usual John Smithy type. This way, when you deal with legal/customs whatever, use the crazily unique legal name while on the internet, use a nickname.<p>Also, while we are discussing names, I seriously suggest you to register domain names (and gmail/fb whatever) for yourself and kids if not already.

Lets start with the only port this private cloud thing shows to Internet is the equivalent of a key authenticated SSH port. You&#x27;re chrome book or laptop or phone can connect securely, everyone else is rather stuck. DDos is pretty easy to do address/port banning but not pure traffic banning. An IP transit provider could simply not pass traffic that wasn&#x27;t SSH tunneled which could help.<p>So if you&#x27;re in that world, now the attack vector is to get you to download something to your phone which can then use the tunnel to look at other stuff in your cloud. This isn&#x27;t a whole lot different than now, phishing out your gmail password for example or keylogging it.

That is, that either the content of the call was being recorded by the NSA, or whatever phone system Congress has set up is both recording and being used to compile a list of people.  The leaks strongly suggest that there is no mass recording of the content of calls by the NSA; although it is possible that the phone number used to contact Congress is being tapped, this would be illegal (since the NSA is not supposed to target communication between US persons) and there isn&#x27;t evidence that it is happening.  As for Congress itself doing it, I guess it&#x27;s possible, but I think lawmakers have better things to do than go after random constituents.<p>The leaks do state that metadata about the call, including that it was made between the parent and Twilio, would have been stored in a database, so theoretically the parent could be targeted for calling on that day &quot;with a few clicks&quot;, as you say.  News outlets have published theories based on the leaks under which this would happen:<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/02/the-nsa-probably-collects-data-on-congresss-phone-calls/283608/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/02/the-nsa-...</a><p>But they sound pretty hyperbolic to me.  Note that according to the official procedures, the data is supposed to be destroyed immediately unless it &quot;is reasonably believed to contain significant foreign intelligence information&quot;, etc.:<p><a href=""http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Minimization%20Procedures%20used%20by%20NSA%20in%20Connection%20with%20FISA%20SECT%20702.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Minimization%20Procedures...</a><p>and the NSA was/is certainly not supposed to intentionally go after this type of information.  But to be fair, I might not have been so skeptical if the parent had only mentioned metadata.<p>The parent responded and brought up COINTELPRO.  Yes, if something like COINTELPRO were happening now, then such fears would be warranted.  I cannot rule that scenario out, but it&#x27;s worth noting that the leaks make it significantly less likely, since the NSA would probably be involved in such a program (as it was in COINTELPRO), yet nothing of the sort came up in the leaks.  I guess the proven ability of the government to keep misconduct secret in general means that it is rational to suspect that some kind of misconduct is happening somewhere, but I wouldn&#x27;t say there&#x27;s enough evidence to rationally specifically fear being targeted for contacting Congress.<p>They and another person also reiterated that the wording was &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be surprised&quot; that something is happening, which is a more general standard than thinking it is actually likely to be happening.  And I admit that even a small chance of it happening can still make it &quot;scary&quot; to call, since the repercussions if it were true could potentially be much larger than the benefits of calling; moreover, some of the people who might call may not be rational or well-informed but still should be entitled to call and state their views on what ought to be happening.  Still, I do not think it&#x27;s unreasonable to ask for evidence either.",1392410422

But it is a red herring. You need to drill down to find students who paid $200K for a worthless education, yes there are some, are they a material subset of all students? No. Look at all the people who were put into mortgages they couldn&#x27;t afford because the rules were changed to incentivize that. That about pulled down the global financial system (we&#x27;re still not quite done with that mistake). There is certainly a social justice issue with student debt, providing loans to students to get degrees that are unmarketable. But the &#x27;fix&#x27; is to get rid of the debt discharge protection that student loans currently have. Allow the students to declare bankruptcy and dump the obligation, and guess what nobody will loan students $200K to get a fine arts degree. Is that a problem ? I don&#x27;t know. For schools?

If we get there, we get there. But until then, we&#x27;ll have to work within the confines of scarcity and that&#x27;s fine.

7240772,comment,7239702,7239702,1,0,michaellosee,,,"> So how do we get as comfortable looking at recent mistakes as we are looking at the ones in the distant past? We probably can&#x27;t - there&#x27;s too much baggage.<p>Self Determination Theory (SDT, <a href=""http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/</a>) has a few ideas on how to answer this question.  SDT provides some tools to deconstruct the concept of self esteem.<p>Traditional self perception is mainly concerned with a healthy self esteem.  Under this paradigm it is only natural for people to regularly evaluate themselves by looking at past success/failures and by comparing themselves to others.<p>SDT provides an alternative to the traditional &quot;self as an object&quot; approach with a &quot;self as a process&quot; approach.  While someone operating under the &quot;self as an object&quot; approach may ask themselves &quot;Am I a good person?  Am I worthy?&quot;, under SDT other questions like &quot;Am I making good choices?&quot; are much more important.  This allows a person to view their own actions more objectively.  Past mistakes are more readily available to be acknowledged and used to inform the future since they do not implicate an individual&#x27;s self worth.<p>The book Mindset (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-How-Fulfil-Your-Potential-ebook/dp/B000FCKPHG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1392407431&sr=8-1&keywords=carol+dweck+mindset"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-How-Fulfil-Your-Potential-eboo...</a>) by Carol Dweck draws on a lot of SDT foundational concepts.  The premise of the book explores and contrasts two mindsets: the static mindset and the growth mindset.  If someone with the static mindset gets easy A&#x27;s in school they take it to mean that they are smart.  If someone with the growth mindsets get&#x27;s easy A&#x27;s it feels like a waste of time because it&#x27;s not challenging.  The author also discusses the benefits of praising a child&#x27;s effort rather than just telling them how smart they are.  It&#x27;s a huge topic and I&#x27;m barely scratching the surface, but I think I&#x27;ve shown the top of this particular rabbit hole.<p>I still struggle with leveraging my failures constructively, but I have found learning about these concepts has enriched my life and helped me discover a hacker&#x27;s mindset.",1392409382

I wasn't thinking about the capex vs opex change, but that's good for me, too.<p>Interesting times indeed.",1223431072

If you really want to feel ""safe"" do a little research and see what ""Greenspan's"" PhD thesis was about.  Spoiler hint: You won't find it.  Folks that have studied his background believe he was ""gifted"" his PhD in effort to allow his rise in the government.  I'm not supporting this viewpoint, just pointing out the uncertainty.  To add irony, Barron's thinks they found a copy and the 1977 thesis was about a housing debacle!!!  <a href=""http://online.barrons.com/public/article/SB120917419049046805.html?mod=mktw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.barrons.com/public/article/SB12091741904904680...</a><p>You may not like that someone thinks its a depression and not a recession.  You may not like that someone thinks its 3 years, not 1 or 5.  But hey, their guess is as good as the ""pros"" at this point.<p>And noone can explain the little raise in the dollar the last week. These little hiccups are almost unpredictable in a complex global economic realignment.<p>So you may not agree with certain words such as ""recession"" vs. ""depression"" or someone's guess as to how long it will last or even if the U.S. will ever recover.\nBut I think the non-quantitative predictions in the article are solid nonetheless.",1223430614

At this size, we all appreciate the close communication with the people using our product and we write those cards out of free will (not just a job description).

326259,comment,326012,326087,0,0,silencio,,,"I once had to deal with a hosting company that had a ticket tracking system that would mark tickets as closed if there was <i>any</i> kind of customer reply, and they had a fat fingered support person or two that also marked tickets as closed..and of course, if a ticket was open for too long they'd automatically be closed, so any ticket I send on a Friday gets closed by Monday morning. I HAD to open a couple dozen tickets and replies to tickets before someone finally replied to me and apologized for the whole thing :) Needless to say that was one reason why I am no longer with them..<p>But I can sort of commiserate with the OP. Midphase support is not exactly the best...I've spent hours trying to get them to understand the most trivial things, like when a friend's website wouldn't work because the mysql server was awol and the support person didn't understand what was wrong with nothing showing on the website.

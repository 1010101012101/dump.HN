6772963,comment,6771260,6772240,7,0,epistasis,,,"Whoa whoa whoa, this is a huge huge huge stretch in terms of <i>causing</i> cancer, and is not consistent with any current beliefs and thoughts on oncogenesis. Methionine availability is much more like the Warburg Effect [1], an effect where cells mostly perform anaerobic instead of aerobic metabolism.<p>Changing one&#x27;s diet based on this speculation would be absolute quackery.<p>A cell&#x27;s addiction to methionine is an <i>effect</i> of cancer, and restricting methionine can be potentially be used to treat cells that are already cancerous, but there&#x27;s no thought on how this could possible <i>cause</i> cancer. Dump a bunch of methionine in cells and they&#x27;re not going to develop cancer, as far as anything I&#x27;ve ever seen. Interestingly enough, diabetes patients that use metformin to treat their diabetes seem to have slightly lower cancer rates than diabetes patients that don&#x27;t use metformin, which has triggered interest in insulin receptors as possible treatment targets or causes, which are vaguely related to metabolism, but such work is extremely early and no conclusions should be drawn. And that&#x27;s on far far more solid ground than methionine as a cancer risk.<p>We understand caloric restriction far better than methionine restriction in terms of extending lifespans of lab animals, so if one wants to speculate on dietary changes, this seems like a far better speculative, pre-knowledge, gamble than methionine restriction.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_effect#Oncology\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_effect#Oncology</a>",1385005933

6772958,comment,6770785,6770785,6,0,syllogism,,,"I write academic papers, and I&#x27;ve started writing blog posts about them, and I think this post doesn&#x27;t cover one of the main reasons that academic papers are less accessible to non-specialists.<p>When you write an academic paper, it&#x27;s basically a diff on previous work. It&#x27;s one of the most important considerations when the paper first comes out. The reviewers and the people up-to-the-minute with the literature need to see which bit is specifically new.<p>But to understand your algorithm from scratch, someone needs to go back and read the previous four or five papers --- and probably follow false leads, along the way!<p>It&#x27;s another reason why academic code is often pretty bad. You really really should write your system to first replicate the previous result, and then write your changes in on top of it, with the a _bare minimum_ branching logic, controlled by a flag, so that the same runtime can provide both results. And you should be able to look at each point where you branch on that flag, and check that your improvements are only exactly what you say they are.<p>When you start from scratch and implement a good bang-for-buck idea, yes, you can get a very simple implementation with very good results. I wrote a blog post explaining a 200-line POS tagger that&#x27;s about as good as any around.[1] Non-experts would usually not predict that the code could be so simple, from the original paper, Collins (2002).[2]<p>I&#x27;ve got a follow-up blog post coming that describes a pretty good parser that comes in at under 500 lines, and performs about as accurately as the Stanford parser. The paper I wrote this year, which adds 0.2% to its accuracy, barely covers the main algorithm --- that&#x27;s all background. Neither does the paper before me, released late last year, which adds about 2%. Nor the paper before that, which describes the features...etc.<p>When you put it together and chop out the false-starts, okay, it&#x27;s simple. But it took a lot of people a lot of years to come up with those 500 lines of Python...And they&#x27;re almost certainly on the way towards a local maximum! The way forward will probably involve one of the many other methods discussed along the way, which don&#x27;t help this particular system.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://honnibal.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/a-good-part-of-speechpos-tagger-in-about-200-lines-of-python/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://honnibal.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/a-good-part-of-spee...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/W/W02/W02-1001.pdf\u200E\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/W/W02/W02-1001.pdf\u200E</a>",1385005771

Lots of machine learning courses will go through the convergence proofs of say, the perceptron algorithm --- even though in all the hard problems, it&#x27;s probably a really bad idea to let your algorithm converge! Your features are high dimensional and noisy, and so are your labels. Any linear separation you find is going to be terribly over-fit.<p>Taking it back to the blog post, when thinking about this k-Means clustering, it&#x27;s actually much more important to think of it in terms of, &quot;okay, all the algorithm gets to see is a term-document matrix&quot;. You should then expect that most other operations over term-document matrices will probably give you similarish results.<p>The difference between, say, k-Means clustering, and a LDA model, are still important for someone working in the area to understand. They should also understand how a hierarchical dirichilet process solves problems you might have for an LDA model.<p>Ultimately, you need to be able to develop a good tool box, and that means reasoning about the performance of various methods on your problem domain. (It doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;blindly twiddle nobs on a collection of crappy implementations, ala weka...&quot;)",1385004923

Like for 4 dimensions, sqrt( ( 0 - 1 )^2 + ( 0 - 0 )^2 + ( 0 - 0 )^2 + ( 1 - 0 )^2 ), which just always gets simplified to something like sqrt( 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 ), which is a little boring.<p>The binary values cause your data points to all be stacked directly on top of each other, which leads me to believe that using binary inputs is a less than ideal application for k-means.

However, unless some unforeseen markets open up, that means leaving the land fallow every few years rather than growing corn, not growing more food for humans.<p>That is where I was going with my original post. If we stopped growing corn completely, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean we gain 80 million acres to grow something else, you just lose the meat out of the nation&#x27;s diet, putting more pressure on the land that is already growing other foods.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it is impossible to see such a transition through, but our agriculture system grew up with animals being a large part of it. To stop that over a short period of time would be a <i>huge</i> transition, and I could see it being an incredibly painful time for farmers and consumers alike.

But the man was an accomplished programmer and knew that great software gets built when a hacker commits himself to doing nothing else but working on it for a couple of weeks. I think he was just trying to edge Hertzfield into working on the Switcher. Another interesting take away from the story is how Gates focuses on what is good for the users and not on M$ controlling the Switcher",1185508789

Questioning applicant's soft drug use is just a great way of smoking out dishonest people (no pun intended.)  If you're not honest about the little things, then you won't be honest about the big things.  They are looking for threats to national security not someone who got high in college.<p>I worked in the defense / intel world for a long time and I never knew anyone who was honest on their app who did not get their clearance.  Everyone I know who lied, even a little bit eventually got caught and lost their jobs.  If you ever want a higher clearance you'll have to take a polygraph and you won't beat that no matter how many tricks you read on the internet... \n",1185507421

On the other side of the same coin, they will be more likely to just click on an ad they do like than muck with some sort of rating system.<p>People don't always know what they like, just because one day they find something attractive doesn't mean a week later or even hours later they will like the same thing.<p>",1185505489

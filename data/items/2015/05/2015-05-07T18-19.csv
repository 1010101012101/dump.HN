In the real world, those who come will usually set the price just below the current market value. If you think about it, it&#x27;s nothing else than the Keen&#x27;s model with just companies being renamed endlessly (after they make one step).<p>But go ahead and try to simulate it, and add more realism. I think you will find very similar result (that is, profit maximizing strategy will never be to compete on price).

Finally judging capitalism by the number of people it lifted out of poverty seems also misguided to me, there are a lot of people that were negatively affected by capitalism.

What business is it to the state of Oregon whether that insurance is provided by the ridesharing company or the driver, as long as at least one of them have it?<p>Doubly so because the text of the measures explicitly includes companies like Uber (&quot;engaged in the
business of providing for-hire transportation

do business in this state and: (A) That provides taxicab services; (B) That is engaged in the business of providing transportation along fixed routes or at regular intervals;&quot;.  Even if this were a reasonable step to take for some other reason, it&#x27;s entirely unreasonable to target specific companies while giving others a free pass.<p>Now, on the other hand, if the targeting were dropped, there is <i>one</i> useful item in the legislation that seems useful based on issues ridesharing drivers have faced elsewhere: ensuring that the <i>owner&#x27;s</i> insurance policy can&#x27;t try to deny coverage to the owner when they&#x27;re driving privately, just because they also drive for a ridesharing service.

One could also make a very convincing, if not definitive argument that imperialism enabled slavery (at the intercontinental scale), and that mercantilism supported it.  Politics, as played by wealthy landowners and slave-traders also perpetuated slavery, as can most easily be seen from the (abominable) actions of the American House of Burgesses.[1]<p>There is very little evidence for the argument that capitalism or free trade was responsible for slavery.  Economics was called &quot;the dismal science&quot; precisely because its critics thought the proponents of free markets were not taking a (racist) vision of &#x27;social justice&#x27; seriously.[2]  Later on in the American South, the bus and streetcar companies tried to segregate busses on the basis of smoking and non-smoking sections, but politicians and racist groups forced them to segregate based on race.  In South Africa during the aparteid, businesses were taken to task for not discriminating strongly enough against the Africans, and many groups such as socialists and unions held racist policies as a tentpole of their platforms.  There are innumberable cases of the market acting against slavery, and even Smith described markets as notable for their lack of nationalism or discrimination.[3]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_codes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_codes</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dismal_science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dismal_science</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations</a>",1431023654

9507172,comment,9502049,9506084,0,0,dllthomas,,,"There are several candidate translations.  Which you might choose depends on those constraints on the actual problem (instead of this pretend one) that make &quot;f x = 0&quot; not an eminently better solution.<p>The one that probably most closely matches the semantics of the pseudo-code would be:<p><pre><code>    let f0 x = unsafePerformIO $ do
        iRef <- newIORef 17
        whileM_ (fmap (>0) $ readIORef iRef) $ do
            modifyIORef iRef (\ i -> i - 1)

        readIORef iRef
</code></pre>
Better would be to let Haskell help check that the mutation is local and no references escape:<p><pre><code>    let f1 x = runST $ do
        iRef <- newSTRef 17
        whileM_ (fmap (>0) $ readSTRef iRef) $ do
            modifySTRef iRef (\ i -> i - 1)

        readSTRef iRef
</code></pre>
There&#x27;s the more idiomatic translation, where for something this simple we wouldn&#x27;t bother with State:<p><pre><code>    let f2 x = go 17
      where
        go i | i > 0 = go (i - 1)
             | otherwise = i

</code></pre>
The literal translation using State is:<p><pre><code>    let f3 x = execState countdown 17
      where
        countdown = whileM_ (>0) $ modify (\ i -> i - 1)
</code></pre>
In all cases, the function as a whole is referentially transparent.<p>In your function, &quot;while i > 0 { i := i - 1 }&quot; is clearly <i>not</i> referentially transparent.  Attempting to transliterate in a way that preserves this expression, it is unsurprising that we wind up with expressions that depend on state.  The State monad is one way of encapsulating this.  Note that f3 and f2 are actually very similar.  The execState function doesn&#x27;t do any deep voodoo - a value of type &quot;State s a&quot; is a thin wrapper around a function of type &quot;s -> (a, s)&quot;;  execState simply extracts this function, applies it to a value, and returns the second part of the output.<p>The actual definitions are equivalent to these (albeit slightly more complicated to keep things DRY w/ transformers):<p><pre><code>    newtype State s a = State (s -> (a, s))

    execState (State f) s = let (_, s&#x27;) = f s in s&#x27;

</code></pre>
What I don&#x27;t see, in any of this, is a problem (conceptual or practical) involving &quot;destructors&quot;.  Is your objection to the need to call execState (or its friends)?",1431023233

Du Bois to Robin Blackburn, from Eric Williams to Walter Johnson—seems condemned to have to prove the obvious anew: Slavery created the modern world, and the modern world’s divisions (both abstract and concrete) are the product of slavery. Slavery is both the thing that can’t be transcended but also what can never be remembered. That Catch-22—can’t forget, can’t remember—is the motor contradiction of public discourse, from exalted discussions of American Exceptionalism to the everyday idiocy found on cable, in its coverage, for example, of Baltimore and Ferguson.<p>The sins of our fathers...

What occurred in this country&#x27;s brief history pales in comparison to the brutality that came before it.<p>Slavery is institutionalized theft, organized crime.

In places like Chicago, what you end up with is a tiny proportion of the population (say 2000) that is perhaps 100 times more likely to be murdered and is a major drain on your city&#x27;s image. This is fuelled by revenge killings; someone gets shot or shot at, their family/friends round up the posse.<p>So what you want to do is get people off the street before they start shooting, or if that fails, you get them off the street as soon as they start shooting in order to break the cycle.<p>At the moment, with the dispatching of officers etc, you find that it takes about 2 minutes from receiving a call to an officer being dispatched (that&#x27;s from the London Ambulance Service). A lot of this is just the time between the call arriving and the operator working out where the person is. Before the call, there are perhaps 15 seconds where the bystander who calls up is getting their phone out and dialing.<p>In this case, with the new system you can in principle have 
two squad cars each half a mile away knowing where the gunshot is to a reasonable level of accuracy, perhaps within a couple of seconds of the shot itself.<p>Within a minute of the first shot, the police can be on the scene. In this case, the suspects have only just jumped into their cars, and so are picked up easily.<p>There&#x27;s no opportunity for any kind of revenge, because the suspects are in a cell.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not a fantastic idea for every city; but if you&#x27;re a company that focuses on military hardware, filtering off into LA, Chicago and NY can easily be an advantage for all.",1431022703

And more criticism goes to the FBI for telling the NSA to engage in bulk collection and FISA court for permitting it, and by extension the president (both of them) mainly for leaving this program on autopilot and also defending it.<p>A task for historians, is to what degree each president really actively defended bulk collection and believed in its appropriateness, vs what was politically possible with the expectation a future court would become involved in unwinding something that president really didn&#x27;t approve of but merely accepted.",1431022499

For its time, the Hoover Dam was the largest in the world, but isn&#x27;t simply the dam itself that represents an impressive feat of engineering. The work that went into diverting the Colorado River was (and still is) probably one of the most remarkable efforts undertaken, with the likely exception of the Three Gorges Dam. Either way, it&#x27;s important to remember that this was a structure started in the 1930s. The age, materials available, the <i>material science known at that time</i>, and so forth are the reasons structures remain important samples of architectural engineering long after they&#x27;ve been eclipsed by more modern developments. Hence why it&#x27;s difficult to tell if you&#x27;re genuinely curious or simply levying unwarranted criticism against categorizing the Hoover Dam as a &quot;marvel.&quot;<p>In other words, it&#x27;s in our nature, for whatever reason, to continue building structures that grow ever larger, require greater understanding of materials--better materials, too--and shadow efforts of the past with new, more impressive, modern designs. However, that doesn&#x27;t supplant those past efforts simply because they&#x27;ve been outdone.

In my opinion it&#x27;s nearly impossible if you&#x27;re going it alone. And unless some of your friends have an exactly coincidental amount of leisure time or extra energy, you probably won&#x27;t make progress.<p>It&#x27;s especially bad if you&#x27;re taking on something that you think is good for the world, because now you have extra pressure, but no extra motivation.<p>Plus, things that are good for the world tend to be <i>products</i>, and not just tools. Those are harder.<p>I know <i>you</i>, the reader reading this, are exempt from this, and you&#x27;re an island of personal productivity that needs no human inputs. That&#x27;s how I used to think, too.

And you might feel the urge to keep it all behind the curtain until The Great Unveiling. This has the effect of making all your small progresses, in the meantime, feel useless. Success recedes further and further away, and human emotional feedback loops don&#x27;t usually work in those situations.<p>So I suggest if you&#x27;re going to use your money and time this way:<p>- Take on something small. REALLY small. Then cut it to 10% of that size. Then release it. Iterate if it seems to be working out and building a community.<p>or:<p>- Be very young and with enough privilege to not have to worry about debt. You have leisure time, few expenses or commitments, and extra energy, and so does almost everyone you know.<p>or:<p>- Make sure others are invested in your success and have a commitment to it that&#x27;s at least in the same order of magnitude as your own. A funded startup is a wonderful way of focusing commitment like this, and ensuring that you have to talk to people all the time. But there are other models.",1431021963

The crux of their findings were that it takes much longer than anticipated for the levels of &#x27;pollution&#x27;, in various form, to drop in concentration with distance from the source. I think the following excerpt from the UofT press release is the most intriguing[1];<p>“The ultrafine particles are particularly troubling,” says Evans. “Because they are over 1000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, they have a greater ability to penetrate deeper within the lung and travel in the body.”<p>On a typical summer day in Toronto, Evans’ instruments measure approximately 20,000 ultrafine particles in each cubic centimetre of air. This means that for every average breath, Torontonians are inhaling 10 million of these nano-sized particles. These numbers increases to 30,000 and 15 million in the winter, when there is more stagnant air and less evaporation of the compounds.&quot;<p>[1]<a href=""http://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/traffic-emissions-may-pollute-1-in-3-canadian-homes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/traffic-emissions-may-po...</a>",1431021800

My advice to others is the same as yours - quit now and try working in another profession. But it is not to see if their definition of &quot;trapped&quot; will change, but to find out, before it is too late, if there is something they find more rewarding.

Given that you know you&#x27;re not a superstar developer so if you&#x27;ll be hiring one as part of the technical team, make sure you pay attention to what he/she says. Listening to others will help you gain respect. The CTO&#x27;s role will be enable the technology to fuel the business. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that you have to be the best developer but it means that you have to help your technical team to achieve it. Give them the tools, ask for their expertise, let them make it happen and communicate the business strategy to them.<p>At such an early stage, you&#x27;ll probably need someone who is a self-starter who can play multiple roles rather than someone you will have to &quot;manage&quot;.

They had analog microphones on phone poles, connected to a logarithmic amplifier which traded dynamic range for bandwidth. Phone audio is 8 bits at 8KHz; think of this as remapping to 16 bits at 4Khz, although it was done with analog hardware.  They needed the dynamic range to see the full risetime of a gunshot, and gave up a big chunk of the voice spectrum to get it.<p>Each microphone had a wired phone line connection to the central system at the police station, which was a PC with a data collection card running LabView.  A LabView program turned gunshot information into map plots.  It was a simple, local system.<p>The new systems are much fancier.  They&#x27;re &quot;cloud-based&quot;, which means the data goes first to ShotSpotter&#x27;s HQ. They have synchronized clocks (probably from GPS), so they can send in timed audio snippets to be matched at the analysis center. It&#x27;s a service now, rather than just hardware.

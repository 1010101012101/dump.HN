You will not get new ranges just because you request them.<p>Solution? Every time a new service goes live - give it a new ip. And another one for failover. You fill your allocations quickly and go back for more ips. This way people who over-allocated will have no problem to free up a full /24 when they need it, once ARIN and others slow down. But you won't get a new /24 at all and will not have any space to reuse / redesign... Cruel, but that will happen.",1257249568

You know, there will be a day when the bills become due. What are you going to do then? Pass them on to your children?<p>It is really weird that Americans feel “we’re rich, you’re not” because of all the things they “possess” (on credit).<p>I wonder how many members of these armies of homeless that populate the US streets are where they are because they lived a live today they couldn’t even afford tommorrow.",1257248727
919089,comment,918915,918915,0,0,jsz0,,,"Good. Companies are going to keep putting off IPV6 migrations until ARIN slows down their deployments of new IPV4 IP space. To this point all the doomsday talk hasn't had much impact on reality. Request IPs, get IPs, ignore problem. Once ARIN does slow down new deployments companies will have to make more efficient use of their existing IPV4 space in the short term. Most of the big deployments I've seen in ISP environments are very wasteful or were hugely over engineered to start with. In my environment I haven't requested new IP space in the last 3 years and could probably go another 2-3 years without a single new public IPV4 IP address.",1257248621

919087,comment,918605,918605,0,0,abrahamsen,,,"At the low point (2000) the EUR was 0.8 USD.  At the high point (2008) it was 1.6 USD.  The (old) EU and the US are close enough economically for a factor two to decide the outcome of most comparisons.<p>Also, when people say Norway is rich, it is not just because it has the second highest GDP of the world. (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#Economy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#Economy</a>).  It is also because they have saved a good part of the oil money (more than USD 100.000 per capita, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government_Pension_Fund_of_Norway"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government_Pension_Fund_of_...</a>) preparing for the combination of an aging population and finite North Sea oil resources).  So they are rich also in the literal sense of having a lot of money, not just spending a lot of money.",1257248557

Wendroid is right to point out the magpie example of self awareness, although I would like to know the relative brain mass index of these birds. I have heard of very similar things with that whole family, with Miner birds being notorious for having mastered a small vocabulary.<p>Had a quick look around for some info on this topic and came accros a great resource :\n<a href=""http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/geopedia/Animal_Minds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/geopedia/Animal_Minds</a><p>I was looking for the study conducted on elephants (Payne, Katherine. National Geographic: ""Elephant Talk."" National Geographic: USA. August 1989) where they studied the infrasound communications of wild elephant herds. This one always struck me as significant, because it whispers to us of a vast and efficient network that would have spanned large areas of the African continent. I always thought of it like whale song, although being propogated through a denser medium it would travel faster and further (?). So maybe at some point during their ancient past, the elephant herds were in constant communication, following signs of water and congregating on grazing grounds and to mate/socialise.... I think this (like the dolphin superpods that have only recently been described in any great detail) shows of a formidable intelligence.",1257248151
919082,comment,918605,918605,0,0,anateus,,,"The article, as many of its ilk, presupposes that certain things are ""good"" and others are ""bad"".<p>Purchasing power is used, rather than GDP as some other commenters have assumed, but it only tells you what is possible to purchase rather than how closely what is possible matches what is desired by that population!<p>Interacting with Scandinavians I've found that the concept known variously as hyggelig , gemytligt, hyggw, koselig, gemuetlichkeit (in various northern European languages) is very central to their cultural identities. It represents a sort of... ""social coziness"", a comfortable harmony, and this is what is sought. To me this stands in contrast to states of mind that would make an American happy.<p>Don't take my comment as saying that this cultural concept somehow renders Scandinavians superior. I find that my own preferences tend towards having the greatest purchasing power, but without delving into the murky depths of cultural relativism it's important to understand that the subjective evaluation of objective economic parameters can vary wildly.",1257248006

I'm sure not everyone who works at Rackspace is technical, so someone could initiate the email notification 5 minutes into the downtime, maybe that could be done via nagios on an external system even.  If the system sees that 50% of the servers are down, notify all customers, regardless if you were directly affected or not.",1257247337

It seems to only happen indirectly, through smaller groups: firstly, people who just like the new idea for its own sake (not practical issues like whether it&#x27;s useful or reliable or value for money etc). Secondly, people who see new benefits from it, that give them a big advantage. Thirdly, people from the mainstream - but because they cautiously check with their friends and colleagues, it&#x27;s a small subgroup of the mainstream (e.g. in an industry, or geographical region, etc - provided people in that subgroup consult with each other). And then another subgroup, then another, til it becomes validated enough for the mainstream to switch as a whole.<p>But if no such route exists (idea-likers -> 10x advantage see-ers -> subgroup -> subgroup -> subgroup etc), then it <i>can&#x27;t</i> be adopted by the mainstream. Because when they check with their friends, no one has heard of it; not even anyone demonstrating how much advantage it gave them. And none of <i>them</i> will try getting a 10x advantage unless the idea in itself has been previously validated by idea-lovers.<p>On your question: I really emphasise with you, losing your hard work and sacrifices; I&#x27;d also want to get something from it, to not feel &quot;cheated&quot;.

To see this, draw a triangle with corners on the north pole, on the equator near Somalia and on the equator in Equador. The resulting triangle has a sum of all corners > 180 degrees.<p>- In a negative curved space, the sum would be less than 180 degrees. In a flat space, it is equal to 180 degrees.<p>- Another way to see the curvature of the surface of the earth is to observe that it&#x27;s impossible to draw 2 parallel lines that do not intersect.<p>- The 2D torus (e.q. the surface of a donut) is flat. Test it with triangles.<p>- The towers of the Verrazano–Narrows Bridge are wider at their top than at their base. This has nothing to do with the earth have a positive curvature. Test it with a torus.<p>- 3D space is nearly always flat in the universe, especially at the surface of our planet.<p>- 4D space-time is not remotely flat. If I throw up a ball, it will come down. This is due the mass of the earth curving its surrounding 4D space-time. The straight line for a ball in the curved space-time looks like the ball changes directions and comes down in our flat 3D space.<p>- If you try to find the triangle of a sphere with the biggest sum of corners, you&#x27;ll discover that the outside and inside of a triangle are interchangeable.

This will hopefully bring some competition to the GPU compute market which is currently owned by Nvidia.<p>The two main reasons Knights Landing is so competitive compared to the previous-generation Knights Corner is that (1) it doubled the raw compute performance per core thanks to its two 512-bit VPUs (vector processing units) per core compared to only 1 VPU per core for Knights Corner, and (2) it upped the number of cores from 61 to 72 while maintaining and even slightly increasing the clock frequency from 1.25 GHz to 1.3 GHz. All this was possible because Knights Landing is manufactured in 14nm while Knights Corner was 22nm, so its logic gates are 2-2.5x denser. Meanwhile all AMD and Nvidia discrete GPUs are still stuck at 28nm.

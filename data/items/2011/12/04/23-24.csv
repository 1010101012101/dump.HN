3312314,comment,3311112,3312161,25,0,makmanalp,,,"Here is your argument: If you say ""The easiest way to launch an undefendable argument against a person who is a brown elephant from mars is to claim that they have too few stomachs"" and then I accuse you of having too few stomachs, obviously I am wrong, or there is something inherently wrong with my argument. This is false.<p>In addition, the fact that she was accused of being too emotional is supposed to a) only apply to women b) be a bogus argument in general and c) indicate sexism.<p>I know a) and b) are false because I have seen tons of men being too emotional and this causing real damage. A very very common example is when a product that has tons of hours,  blood, sweat and tears invested into it has to be tossed because of strategic reasons. Employee X will not have any of that and will relentlessly lobby and defend the product, because the product is their baby. X is being too emotional.<p>In the author's defense, it didn't seem to me that the author was being too emotional in the incident. From the information provided, that is a false accusation.<p>About c), nothing in the story as it is seems to indicate sexism to me. Make no mistake, it looks like an unfair attack on the author. Maybe everyone hated her for some other reason, or maybe it was really sexist. We, as readers, do not know. Maybe there were other elements to the story, other events / conversations / attitudes that did not make it to the post. Who knows? If those did exist and were in there, maybe the sexism argument would be valid. Being unfair towards a person who happens to be a woman is not the same thing as sexism. The latter is a subset of the former.<p>When everyone in the comments accuse the author of being too emotional, they are probably referring to the fact that she is telling a story where sexism is not apparent (from the given evidence) and she is immediately attributing it to sexism.<p>This is a feared situation. People are afraid when someone who is in the abused side of an anything-ism call other people abusers without apparent reason. For example, I am middle eastern, and it's scary to other people when I start calling people who I don't get along with racists. This is similar to the sort of trump card argument that the author hates. It villifies the alleged abuser, even if they were not guilty, and the alleged abuser is in a disadvantaged situation to properly defend themselves. If I do this, inadvertently or not, this is considered a low blow.<p>You will see people all around you bending over backwards to avoid this sort of dynamic: Sheltered white people may act all nervous and awkward around people of other races because they try to act nice but come off overly fake, german people may do the same when conversation is started about jewish people (as if it was them, not other people, that caused the holocaust or as if they were guilty by association) and hell, even some MIT students will not say where they graduated from unless specifically prompted, because they are afraid to be percieved as the stereotype of high and mighty jackasses and not fairly as themselves.<p>The point is, sexism is a serious accusation that is not to be thrown around lightly these days. If it is to be made, there needs to be serious evidence. Otherwise, it's just foul play. Unfair attitude towards a person who is a woman is not the same as sexism.",1323042935

Actually being a sexist, however, is not. So they use lightly-coded language like drama, emotional, touchy, frustrated, paranoid and the sexism card. Thus, other sexists can applaud them without admitting to sexism.

3312305,comment,3311179,3311610,1,0,gue5t,,,"Javascript is turing-complete. That's a /lot/ of power and that means that security-conscious users (especially given the proliferation of more-powerful JS apis allowing the possibility for exploits in file, GPU, etc. access, along with JIT-enabled exploits as opposed to the old simple interpreting) will have it turned off whenever possible.<p>Using CSS for non-turing-complete interactions which are limited in their computational ability to a simple automaton means that CSS can be trusted much more than JS, and that there are stricter guarantees on performance. It's also semantically cleaner when used for things like visual effects on windows, because even if CSS doesn't load, the markup representing the menu will be intact. JS systems have the ability to load markup asynchronously or generate it from other data in the page and destroy all notion of graceful degradation.",1323042575

There are plenty of caribbean + pacific islands that could fall into this task.  It may not mean taking a whole country but simply signing a century-long lease over a portion, maybe like British Hong Kong or modern Guantanamo Bay.  I'm sure plenty of poor nations would gladly accept rental revenues for a mostly unwanted piece of land.<p>As for revenue streams - if a settlement could be located somewhere climatically agreeable, and out of jurisdiction of sovereign states, simply having cheap alcohol + food, and gambling would be more than enough to get the cash rolling in.  An off-shore casino could simply run tighter odds and more drinks and make it worthwhile for people to go to.  After all, Monaco and Las Vegas used this to their advantage for a long time just by being places where gambling could exist.<p>I think it's a very novel idea and I hope someone tries it one day.  If it's the same site I've seen before (TLDR) they posit the idea that the first attempt would likely be a re-purposed cruise ship.  And don't forget, there is already a cruise ship ('The World') that is doing <i>something</i> like this but mobile instead of stationary.<p>Bascially, instead of predicting what would or wouldn't work, someone should try it out and see what happens.

Basically, you pay a subscription fee (or you can just pay as you go, of course) to get a bike from a docking station, ride it to another docking station closest to your destination, and push it into the station and forget about it.<p>The biggest problem, which does not at all make the system impractical, seems to be the availability of working bikes and open docks at the stations you choose. The city (Montreal) seems to have trucks that go around and redistribute bikes fairly often based off of the real-time data the stations give them. Still, there have been several situations where during peak hours there are favorite ""pick-up"" and ""drop-off"" points, meaning there are no bikes for you to pick up, and if you do get a bike, there is no space at the station where you want to drop it off. There is usually a bike or two that's broken down at each station, so it's important to put every bike through a few tests to avoid frustration.<p>For me, the times that it was the most useful was either to commute, supposing a bike was actually available, or to get home after a late night out after the metro has closed. I hate taxis and will only take one at last resort, it was awesome to just take a bike back home.<p>I overall liked it but it's difficult for me to justify the added cost, since I'm not about to get rid of my metro pass. I would probably end up saving money if I replaced my pass with bikes and packs of metro tickets if I really wanted to, but that would not work during the winter when the stations go away.",1323040190

Lots of people like the 'concept' of being able to start fresh but few really internalize the challenges. One person I know feels it would be easier to privately colonize the Moon than to build a viable seastead.<p>That being said, there has been some interesting work in seawater chemistry that suggests you might precipitate out of seawater a form of concrete [1]. Of course it would be hard to precipitate out a <i>floating</i> island but one might imagine building a 'reef equivalent' by growing it from the seafloor up. I personally don't think it is practical but I find the exploratory engineering entertaining and thought provoking.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.build.new-atlantis.org/seacrete.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.build.new-atlantis.org/seacrete.htm</a>",1323039686

I haven't used silk road so I might be missing something, but I'd love to learn how they get around that.",1323039602

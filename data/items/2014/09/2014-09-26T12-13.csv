You have explained better than I ever could how their &quot;dumping&quot; of money on unworthy poseurs is not only non-productive but actively harms the whole process of innovation as it crowds out people like you who actually know what they&#x27;re doing.  I guess the upside is that a larger number of leaner companies might spend a lower percentage of their budgets on marketing, so the effect on people like you might be reduced.<p>Best of luck to you.",1411733216

But it&#x27;s still separate to being dedicated to what you do.<p>There are several occupations people enter knowing there is little monetary reward. Schoolteachers don&#x27;t make much but they are dedicated to building children&#x27;s lives and can&#x27;t imagine themselves doing anything else. So are artists and generally anyone who has found their calling.<p>If I had a only a year to live I probably would still be working on the things I&#x27;m working on now.<p>[1] -  It&#x27;s a fair hypothesis that the most valuable company would be the one where everyone involved is rewarded in proportion to the value they generate. You can&#x27;t build some kinds of companies if you keep 100% of the equity as a founder btw. Look at Alibaba&#x27;s $210b IPO and Alibaba&#x27;s founder who has only 8.4%.",1411732908

The fact that they need one (and they do, judging from what&#x27;s on it) is already a red flag for me.<p>We run &quot;only&quot; about 150 containers at the moment, so maybe I&#x27;d appreciate it more if we had thousands, but to me it seems horribly overcomplicated. And I have an immediate dislike to anything that requires constantly running processes in every VM. That may be necessary for full VM&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s one of the reasons I don&#x27;t think VM focused orchestration solutions are a good fit for container based systems. Our existing (homegrown, on top of OpenVz) system makes heavy use of the fact that every resource in the containers are accessible from the host, and that&#x27;s one of the thing I like abut Docker too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/terminology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/terminology.html</a>",1411732857

When someone asks you a question you generally know what kind of answer they expect.<p>In this classic example from Richard Feynman [1] the answer to &quot;Why is Aunt Minnie in the hospital&quot; can be &quot;She broke her hip&quot;, &quot;She slipped on the ice and broke her hip&quot;, &quot;An ambulance took her there&quot;, &quot;Because her husband is concerned for her well being&quot;.<p>What&#x27;s interesting about the Watson approach is that, by taking intelligently composed web pages as input (as opposed to randomly generated texts, or an arbitrary list of atomic facts) the context is already &quot;baked in&quot;. Put another way, people make web pages with sentences like &quot;Aunt Minnie is in the hospital because she fell and broke her hip&quot;, and don&#x27;t make web pages with sentences like &quot;Aunt Minnie is in the hospital because the ambulance was headed there and the friction between Aunt Minnie and the bed in the ambulance was high enough to keep them from becoming relatively displaced&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8</a><p>(Edit: I notice, of course, that I have now created a web page with that exact sentence.)",1411732822

I'm guessing this user falls in the < 1% category. Maybe it makes for a funny story, but it's hardly representative of a normal user. If 99% of your users figured it out, move on. If Microsoft waited for 100% of their users to figure out a feature, we'd still be waiting for the one guy staring at power button and wondering what to do.",1221299569

I did a Google, found out it uses a relaxed version of the Spore DRM (5 installs), and killed the order. My cofounder said to buy the game and use a pirated version, but I refuse to support this crap, and that's with the sequel to my favourite game of all time. They are <i>nuts</i> if they don't think this happens.<p>What has the world come to when the pirated version is the version that does <i>not</i> install spyware?",1221299485

I am known as [RonPaul2008]cookiecaper in Quake Wars, and have a Ron Paul spray in TF2. I've heard three or four people say Ron Paul clan signs and sprays influenced them to learn about the dude, so it seems at least somewhat effective.",1221297353

Also she kept a pot of cabbage on the stove, which she had boiling when we arrived and took the top off of, smelling up the place like no other.<p>All this to make sure we would flee the place and never come back, thus keeping her cushy low-rent &#x27;temporary&#x27; housing.

7069369,comment,7069004,7069350,7,0,tptacek,,,"There&#x27;s a widely held belief that the way NSA stockpiles exploits harms Internet security. One plausible way that could be true is if NSA sources exploits from researchers who would otherwise sell them to places that would disclose them to vendors, which NSA won&#x27;t do.<p>And, obviously, there&#x27;s the widely held (and very plausible) belief that NSA backdoored random number generator standards. Those backdoors probably aren&#x27;t currently doing much harm to the Internet, because they aren&#x27;t in use on systems whose random numbers we (a) care much about and (b) are exposed 32 bytes at a time. But still, it&#x27;s reasonable to expect NSA to stop doing that kind of thing.",1389880757

Also, it is less reliable than a two way mirror in most configurations, because recovering from a disk loss requires reading the entirety of every other disk, whereas recovering from loss in a mirror requires reading the entirety of one disk. The multiplication of the probabilities don&#x27;t work out particularly well as you scale up in disk count (even taking into account that raidz2 tolerates a disk failure mid-recovery). And mirroring is much faster, since it can distribute seeks across multiple disks, something raidz2 cannot do. Raidz2 essentially synchronizes the spindles on all disks.<p>Raidz2 is more or less suitable for archival-style storage where you can&#x27;t afford the space loss from mirroring. For example, I have an 11 disk raidz2 array in my home NAS, spread across two separate PCIe x8 8-port 6Gbps SAS/SATA cards, and don&#x27;t usually see read or write speeds for files[1] exceeding 200MB/sec. The drives individually are capable of over 100MB/sec - in a non-raidz2 setup, I&#x27;d be potentially seeing over 1GB/sec on reads of large contiguous files.<p>Personally I&#x27;m going to move to multiple 4-disk raid10 vdevs. I can afford the space loss, and the performance characteristics are much better.<p>[1] Scrub speeds are higher, but not really relevant to FS performance.",1389879521

Isn&#x27;t that just as much &quot;collusion and conspiracy&quot; from the other side?</i><p>Employers have a natural organizational advantage, as well as advantages of capital and resources.  Given that virtually any workplace has a 1:n relationship with its employees, the bargaining advantage is with the employer.  Within a labor market as a whole, a small number of companies may affect a huge number of workers (the case lists a handful of firms and 60,000 or more employees).<p>This was recognized by Adam Smith in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>:<p><i>It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in number, can combine much more easily: and the law, besides, authorises, or at least does not prohibit, their combinations, while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work, but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes, the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, or merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks, which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year, without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate.</i><p><i>We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate. To violate this combination is everywhere a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours and equals. We seldom, indeed, hear of this combination, because it is the usual, and, one may say, the natural state of things, which nobody ever hears of. Masters, too, sometimes enter into particular combinations to sink the wages of labour even below this rate. These are always conducted with the utmost silence and secrecy till the moment of execution; and when the workmen yield, as they sometimes do without resistance, though severely felt by them, they are never heard of by other people.</i><p>And on for a number of paragraphs.<p><a href""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm#link2HCH000"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm#link2H...</a><p>Chapters VII and X of book 1 discuss labour, wages, and various differentiators among them.

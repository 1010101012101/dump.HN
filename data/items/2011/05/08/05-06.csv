2525356,comment,2525071,2525071,19,0,Laments,,," Lets start out by pointing out the worst part of this: the disclosure issue trickles down into TC's journalists. A FB comment on this article, as written by Alexia Tsotsis: ""'It's frustrating to read comments day in and day out about how people think TechCrunch should be, or what it's supposed to say. Arrington's response: It'll say whatever the fuck we want it to, because we're people and we find some stories interesting. That's news.'<p>Accurate.""<p>This type of stuff makes me want to stop reading TC. Today. Unfortunately, I still think theyre the best at what they do (mostly due to quantity of relevant coverage).<p>But, to get stuck there would be to ignore the elephant in the room: Arrington. So, to refresh: the original problem wasn't just that Arrington wasn't disclosing, but that he was not running stories and possibly skewing coverage because of it.<p>So, what does Arrington have to say to defend himself? ""But the really important thing to remember, as a reader, is that there is no objectivity in journalism. The guys that say theyre objective are just pretending.""<p>Oooh, that's a top-notch defense. By placing the blame on everybody else, he's hoping that we'll talk about everybody else -- and then ignore him, as if he's the hero by pointing out that other people are conflicted. And, let's be fair here -- he's trying like hell to shut up anyone who criticizes him now or in the future by embarrassing them, and their colleagues, as hard as he can right in the article.<p>But wait, let's refocus on that last sentence -- and their colleagues. Arrington touches on Kara Swisher, and then after mentioning that she disclosed fully (which she did on the original article; see: <a href=""http://kara.allthingsd.com/20110428/godspeed-on-that-investing-thing-yertle-but-i-still-have-some-questions-for-your-boss-arianna/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kara.allthingsd.com/20110428/godspeed-on-that-investi...</a> ) he then attacked her colleague who has <i></i>no relevance at all<i></i> to this. To quote Arrington: ""One of her writers, Liz Gannes, is married to a Facebook consultant. She covers the company and its competitors regularly. She discloses it as well, but it isnt clear whether or not her husband has stock in Facebook. Thats something as a reader Id like to know.""<p>Arringtons game here is pure deflection with an end-goal of humiliating critics as hard as he can. Its hard to not feel sorta disgusted here.<p>And to those of you who say hes trying to get fired by AOL? I think he is, too. The reason that Arrington stated that he was willing to be bought out by AOL was: ""I wasnt tired of writing, or speaking at events. I was tired of our endless tech problems, our inability to find enough talented engineers who wanted to work, ultimately, on blog and CrunchBase software.""<p>But that's hard to believe. CrunchBase isnt bringing in any revenue (Creative Commons Attribution License) and I doubt it can be monetized. It brings little value for anyone who isnt interested in angel-seed startup investing.<p>So, lets look at Gawkers analysis of the TechCrunch/AOL deal:<p>""Although the details of AOL's purchase agreement with TechCrunch have not been released, the consensus is that AOL used a three-year earnout designed to give Arrington and other TechCrunchers an incentive to stick around and do a great job.  Based on various reports, we estimate that this earnout could likely amount to $10-$15 million above the original purchase price. $10-$15 million is a significant amount of money, even to Mike Arrington. We suspect, therefore, that even if Arrington gets bored or loathes working for AOL, he won't just quit because that would mean walking away from this cash.<p>If AOL management gets tired of Arrington's behavior, meanwhile, they presumably can't just fire him, because this would likely trigger a full payment of the earnout. To can Arrington and avoid paying the earnout, AOL would likely have to fire him 'for cause' And given that this behavior is par for Arrington's course, it would be hard to argue that it constituted 'cause'.""<p>So, yes, even though Arrington wrote in 2009 that ""one change Im going to make at TechCrunch is to get rid of all of our investment conflicts. Ive long been an angel investor and have continued to make a very few investments even after starting TechCrunch. These investments are always disclosed and in my opinion we do more than enough to maintain transparency there. But its also a weak point that competitors and disgruntled entrepreneurs use to attack our credibility. So over the next few months Im going to divest myself of all of those investments in an orderly fashion, and Ill update readers on the progress. Ill also discontinue making any further investments,"" when you fast forward to 2011, his statement is an implicit admission that he's trying to undermine TechCrunch's credibility:<p>""I have also become a limited partner in two venture funds, Benchmark Capital and SoftTech VC. I am considering investments in a few other venture funds and a couple of startups as well, but have nothing further to announce yet.... When these investments are complete, in a few months, theres a very good chance that Ill be a direct or indirect investor in a lot of the new startups in Silicon Valley, and that will mean that there will be financial conflicts of interests in a lot of my stories. Either because I write about those companies, or write about a competitor, or dont write about a competitor.""<p>If Arrington's trying to poison the site, and I think he is, I'm going to try to find another news site. It's only going to go downhill from here... with a lot of bluster and paranoia from Arrington against all threats, real or perceived.",1304834199

2525331,comment,2525286,2525299,1,0,Ixiaus,,,"I think the larger issue that is bugging you is the fact that user's data on the web is no longer owned/exchanged by the user but by the properties that the user interacts with. It frustrates me too, believe me. I would much rather visit a site that asks me for my FOAF (contains relationships to friends, profile data, &c...) URI, and a cert to authenticate me (this is called FOAF+SSL) - then automatically load and cache (for say, a month?) my FOAF profile data. Thereby never requiring me to enter anything more than once <i>except</i> for my FOAF URI path.<p>Sad thing is, it isn't the providers that can't adopt it - the technology exists; it's the users. Users are locked into a model that is out-dated and are also locked into their own laziness and ignorance (many users would be scared off by the very mention of ""FOAF"" let alone maintaining their ""own"" FOAF file).<p>But, here are some of my counter arguments to your comment:<p>A) some users (I'm one of them) don't always use my actual IP to register on a site, I use anonymizing services often so I usually get frustrated by geolocating/ajax auto-fill forms and give up on a site that doesn't do any sort of graceful fallback<p>B) AJAX isn't effective when your user can't use Javascript (have you tried using your site with a screen reader? Can blind people use your site with ease?)<p>C) The act of typing in your address really is not that painful - I specifically set my forms with the autocomplete=""off"" attribute so user's personal data isn't being stored by their browser in the name of ""convenience"" (particularly billing forms that ask for your address data <i>and</i> cc data)",1304832684

8716697,comment,8716111,8716631,0,0,Osmium,,,"> A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy - William B. Irvine<p>I read this, and have nothing bad to say about it <i>per se.</i> I think Stoicism in the classic sense is very under-appreciated these days, and it&#x27;s good to have a book to serve as an introduction. But I personally found it to be very repetitive. The historical context part is worth reading in my opinion, but apart from that you&#x27;d be better off reading something like Marcus Aurelius&#x27; <i>Meditations</i> instead, or some of the other classics.<p>Edit: Or if you&#x27;re interested in a contemporary overview, I found AC Grayling&#x27;s <i>What is Good?</i> to be much more insightful. Its central theme is also a search for some form of &quot;philosophy of life&quot;, like Irvine&#x27;s book, but it doesn&#x27;t cover just Stoicism. Instead it covers many more philosophies, and I think it&#x27;s a much richer book because of it since it gives you a much broader context, even if you end up adopting a Stoic outlook.",1418050715

IE, if you are wiling to pay big city salaries in a small town location, that could be attractive to some people. Not everyone and obviously if you have Google/Facebook hiring requirements it&#x27;s not an option. But, if you need to hire 5-10 a year it might work. Not everyone will want it. But, the minority that do want it want it a lot.<p>IE, imagine a couple with small kids from London comings for an interview to a nice location in Crete. Instead of a tiny London 2 bedroom, they can move into a nice cottage. They can save hours a day in commutes and get more cash into savings. That will appeal to some employees (or their wives/husbands). You can&#x27;t say Crete is objectively better or worse than the London buzz. But, it is different in a way that will inevitably appeal to some.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s hard not to adjust your salary expectations (as an employer) to local salaries and that just isn&#x27;t compatible with relocation hiring. People don&#x27;t relocate for a lower salary, even if cost of living is lower. I think the EU has a lot of these possibilities that are still under appreciated.<p>If you think your main win/lose parameter is the quality of people you can hire, you should think creatively about how to win here.

8716638,comment,8713807,8714990,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Is it true that some humans are r-selected, which means they’re promiscuous and want to have lots of children, and some humans are k-selected, which means they invest in a few children?</i><p>This is not what I&#x27;m saying. If you look at any human&#x27;s ancestry, you&#x27;re going to find both influences. The last thing I intend to say is that there are meaningful differences <i>between</i> humans (either at an individual or group level) on this front. My point is that both sex drives exist, because both are a part of our evolutionary story.<p><i>Humans as a species are absurdly k-selected. How many species can you think of that have young that are totally helpless for their first decade of life? r/k selection theory would argue that we wouldn’t have casual sex, because humans are not remotely r-selected on any conceivable level!</i><p>My argument is that all humans are both, each to some degree, although the K-drive is more socially acceptable, civilized, and progressive... and probably the stronger one in most of us.<p>Being r-selective is actually very adaptive during times of ecological stress, such as after a population crash. K-selection is more fruitful when population is at saturation and the only available growth is civilization&#x27;s progress. I don&#x27;t intend to moralize on this. We needed both drives to get us where we are. You&#x27;re right that, as applies to any specific animal, the r/K selection theory is a bit simplistic because almost all advanced organisms exhibit traits derived from both evolutionary imperatives (quality and quantity). For example, trees are K-selective in terms of being durable and large, but r-selective in terms of having many seeds.<p>As for &quot;we wouldn&#x27;t have casual sex&quot;, I&#x27;m not so sure that there&#x27;s an either/or. Humans are an advanced animal and, given both our cognitive capability (and flexibility) and our numbers, it&#x27;s quite reasonable to assume that human behavior includes the full spectrum of strategies. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to suppose that humans are predisposed to r-selective behavior when young (15-25) and K-driven behavior when older (25+).",1418049968

8716577,comment,8716111,8716111,0,0,netcan,,,"The War of Art by Steven Pressfield<p>It&#x27;s written for writers but is relevant broadly. The message is pretty simple and you don&#x27;t really need to read the whole book to get it. It&#x27;s one of those keep-driving-the-message self help-ish books.<p>Basically the point is to name and shame &quot;resistance,&quot; a catch all term for procrastination, fear and everything else that prevents a writer from writing a book. It also applies to starting a startup, a career, a family, an exercise regime… Like I said, the point is simple and the information could be conveyed in a short essay.<p>The reason for the repetition is to actually realize how big a demonic bottleneck this resistance is and that overcoming it will take effort and more importantly, strategy. It&#x27;s probably going to derail your plans unless you plan for it. Personifying  (or demonifying) it is part of the approach.<p>This is getting further from the book&#x27;s actual content but the analogy for me is addiction. Say you are an alcoholic. It&#x27;s not enough to decide to stop drinking, this is a fight. You need to realize that addiction will probably win if you fight stupid. You need a plan to beat addiction. It will fight back. You need to put time and resources into it. Everyone knows this and former alcoholics will start pushing you straight into two things, making sure you realize the scale of the problem and making sure you have a plan. They&#x27;ll probably recommend AA which gives you a formulaic strategy.<p>Resistance might not be the bottleneck for everyone, but it is for many. For us, we need to make war on it",1418049298

Like other economic metrics it can be gamed (see Argentine inflation stats), or more commonly, &quot;lite gaming&quot; where people pick a definition of the statistic that is a good fit for their political goals.<p>Two examples spring to mind. The UK recently got hit with a large bill by the EU. The reason is that a new method of calculating GDP was introduced that tried to incorporate economic activity from the black market (drugs, prostitution etc). This raised the UK&#x27;s overall GDP by enough to also raise its expected contribution to the EU budget. Is the new GDP statistic more accurate than the previous one? That&#x27;s hard to say, almost by definition because the activity they&#x27;re trying to include isn&#x27;t being reported to any government. It boils down to a guessing game.<p>For another example, look at the the way house prices are incorporated (or not) into inflation calculations. Turns out countries around the world don&#x27;t agree on the best way to do this, and use varying methods. Some ignoring housing entirely, others ignore house prices and try to guesstimate what the rent for a property would be (very hard if there are not many renters in the area), etc. It&#x27;s all rather debatable - and debated.<p><i>> This makes trying to stabilize the price to some set of goods very difficult, because no matter what you pick, you&#x27;ll have to cut supply somehow, and that just won&#x27;t work without something akin to a central bank.</i><p>I&#x27;m interested to know which central bank you are thinking of that has recently cut the money supply (btw &quot;money supply&quot; in economics normally means the amount of all money in circulation, not the growth in it). All central banks I know of only ever create more money, they hardly ever (never?) bring down the monetary base long term.<p>Regardless, you&#x27;re correct that many cryptocurrency proponents (like me) don&#x27;t want to see some kind of Soviet style planning committee in charge of the money supply. Partly because there&#x27;s little evidence it would work. The really sharp changes in Bitcoin&#x27;s value occur due to press cycles, government actions and press cycles triggered by government actions. For example the huge spike last year was triggered by a combination of the first Silk Road shutdown, a favourable US Senate hearing, and huge activity in China being firstly pumped by that countries capital controls and then suddenly cut off due to enforcement of the same.<p>But eventually, it seems like these events will stop happening. Governments will have mostly taken an enforceable position on Bitcoin one way or another, so that source of unpredictability will go away. The press will lose interest. Everyone who cares will have heard about it and made a decision. Bitcoin will become boring. At that point I&#x27;d hope (and expect!) that it&#x27;d be rather stable indeed, or at least the value would slowly fall due to the inflationary pressure. During quiet periods when nobody is really paying attention to Bitcoin its value fluctuates much less.",1418048835

8716522,comment,8715077,8715077,0,0,sdf09jk2df,,,"Nobody wants to admit the leading cause of suicide in the military, probably in society in general, because it is politically sensitive. There is fear that announcing the leading demographic outright might make matters worse before it gets better. I have been a soldier in the US Army for 17 years, and the FBI has likely identified the cause of this trend using statistics.<p>The leading cause for suicide in the US military is that society is generally becoming increasingly incompatible with military service. The demographic least likely to commit suicide of any age range are black females. The demographic most likely to commit suicide are white males under the age of 25. It should be known that suicides occur among all races, genders, and ages. The problem, however, is not that suicide occurs but the quantity and trends with which it occurs.<p>The cultural generation born between the mid 1990-2005 are referred to as Millennials. This group is the first born into a world where the internet has always existed and divorce among their parents stands at record highs. This group is less willing to make social commitments, expects constant social feedback, and delays making life changing decisions longer than previous generations. Of particular concern is that this group tends to be nurtured more directly and longer than previous generations even while relationships of their elders disintegrate more rapidly.<p>In previous generations people learn some hard life lessons early in life. Not everybody gets to be a winner. Time is short. If you screw-up there is a punishment. Quitting is not acceptable when people depend upon you. Life isn&#x27;t fair. Many Millennials are shielded from these harsh lessons by over protective guardians.<p>This profound change in social development has numerous consequences. Withdrawal from society and intimacy are perhaps the most common consequence for society generally. In the military you cannot hide from society, so simply withdrawing is not an option.<p>The military is also a highly confrontational environment. Positive confrontations are often regarded as a necessary quality in successful corporate environments, but not everybody is well prepared for communication that is so direct. Typically the confrontations in the corporate world are soft or rare for entry level positions, where the opposite is true in the military.<p>Historically military training has attempted to prepare people for this. Basic training is extremely confrontational and not in a positive way, but basic training is also a safe environment. In earlier times basic training was less safe thereby increasing stress for attendees. If a person is not sufficiently stressed during their entry level training they are ill-prepared to manage such stresses when their career becomes at risk.<p>Related:

Israeli oppression and annexation (confiscation) of West Bank territory breeds resentment and hatred among <i>all</i> Palestineans, though, and with good reason. I have never seen a good argument for why this policy should be in place. If you forcibly take away people&#x27;s property and livelihood, of course they will want to defend themselves. Pulling out of Gaza was probably a good move on Israel&#x27;s side, although it&#x27;s incredibly sad that this opportunity has not even after a decade resulted in a higher standard of living for the people of Gaza.<p>Hamas, on the other hand, needs to act less like a terrorist organization and more like a mature government. I am certain that this last bit will not happen, but at least there are more sound arguments for why Hamas policy is foolish if Israel&#x27;s peace-time policies are solid from a human rights perspective. Self-defense against terrorism and guerillia tactics is predictably destructive to the civilian population, so I&#x27;d rather not get into that bag of snakes. The only consolation is that international pressure holds the Israeli military to a relatively high moral standard; I shudder to think what would have happened under the military doctrines of the 1900s and before.<p>Finally, very happy to see that there is digital commerce going on in Gaza. Economic development is key to ensuring better lives and hopefully resolving this terrible conflict. So if the surveillance opportunity means that Gaza/West Bank internet traffic is relatively unhindered, that provides one sound channel through which commerce is possible (in spite of the perverted background of control and surveillance).",1418048652

Building AMIs (and booting new instances from them on each deploy) takes a lot longer than building a new Docker image and launching containers from it.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure I understand what you&#x27;re asking though. We&#x27;ve so far only Dockerized the main Python application, and not many of the supporting applications. We don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d go down the route of running Postgres, ElasticSearch, Redis etc under Docker.<p>To give you an example of times taken, Pull Requests take about 10 minutes to test, a full master build (including uploading build artifacts) takes around 15 minutes, and a deployment to 8 Dockerized web hosts is about 5 minutes, including a smoke test on each host.<p>EDIT: Just realised what you&#x27;re asking. If you&#x27;re running many processes on each host then yes it can take a while to deploy. We deploy our Celery workers under separate Docker containers and this can take a while to stop and start.

I feel like I have gone through a plethora of software to find what I need all to find out it just does not work right or I cannot justify the expense due to the lack of offerings.<p>I currently use Highrise for my own personal CRM, and I like it.  I also use Basecamp for projects, I almost love it.  The problem is, Highrise does not have an app and the two are not one.  I would love to have a provider that has everything in one, and preferably in app format as I need notifications for staff working on projects.<p>Other services I have tried consist of Podio (too clunky), Zoho (borderline too complicated and lacks features for PM), vTiget (just did not work) and Insightly (nothing seems to sync up for tasks).<p>I have a team of 7 who all work remote with tasks ranging from dev to social media.  Some of the projects will last for years (contracts) and some last just until they are complete.  Hopefully from what others share I will be able to find a single solution!",1418047470

97414,comment,97375,97375,0,0,nickb,,,">DHH also went so far as to recommend we not treat the Rails community as a 'paid vendor' and to 'wipe the wah-wah tears' from my chin. While that is a very valid request, I don't believe it applies in this situation.<p>Great. What a way to spoil good will of the community.<p>>Additionally, our business will not be significantly affected one way or the other by the future actions of the Rails community.<p>Then why are you whining? Why did you write that 2st post in the first place?<p>>That said, I would like to see Ruby on Rails reach toward that critical mass of users, and thereby become a larger portion of our business.<p>Huh? You just said it's not.<p>>If Ruby on Rails were made to be simpler to use with a wider range of hosting environments, big and small, that would ultimately benefit Rails itself far more than it would benefit DreamHost or me personally.<p>Sure, maybe it would but what are YOU doing to help? Whining is NOT helpful!<p>I'm not a Dreamhost customer but these idiotic posts have made me resent Dremahost and I will avoid ever dealing with them and ever recommending them.",1200104830

97407,comment,97384,97384,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Very nice visual design.<p>Your code will improve at once if you read a Ruby book. For example, you confess to being confused in your fueling.rb model file --<p><GOBBLEDEGOOK><p>-- where you define a class method on the Fueling class, then set an instance variable (@current_id). I believe this will set @current_id in the scope of the Fueling class. Then you define a Fueling instance method (validate) and try to read @current_id inside it -- but it fails, because when you're in an instance method @current_id refers to a variable in some actual Fueling <i>object</i>, not to the @current_id that's in the scope of the Fueling <i>class</i>.<p></GOBBLEDEGOOK><p>You may have no idea what I just said. Even experts can get lost in Ruby's class hierarchy. So get a Ruby book and it will help you sort out the Ruby approach to OO programming.<p>People seem to like ""Ruby for Rails"", and its author is smart. The Pickaxe book (""Programming Ruby"") is more famous and I liked that just fine, too. (Don't tell Zed Shaw.) If you're not already intimately familiar with another OO language, you might <i>not</i> want to learn Ruby from _Why the Lucky Stiff's <i>Poignant Guide to Ruby</i> (with cartoon foxes!)... although that's what I did.<p>P.S. Just <i>today</i> I had my accountant explaining to me the importance of separate tracking for ""business"" miles that I drive for my company, as well as tracking total miles driven. Food for thought. Just don't offer that feature if you plan to take the service down sometime during a tax year...",1200104267

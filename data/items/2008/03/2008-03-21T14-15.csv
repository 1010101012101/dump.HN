142469,comment,142373,142373,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"This relates to a recent idea I had - ""true social software"" or perhaps ""locally social software"".<p>Many people comment on the irony of how the modern world makes people feel isolated despite giving them more means of communication than ever before. For example, I don't know anyone that lives in my neighborhood, and I think this is common. Social software doesn't help with this, typing ""A/S/L"" into an AOL chat room doesn't really enhance my social life, neither does posting a pic on Myspace.<p>Now think of the appeal of geographically local communication tools. For example, maybe a chat room would be localized so as to only cover a local coffee shop. People in the chat room could leave away messages about what they're reading, and others would comment on it. After a good IM conversation, people might walk a few feet and have a conversation in real life. I might meet someone everytime I go to the coffee shop, whereas now I might meet a new person every few months. ""True social"" software facilitates socialization in meat space and helps to break down the social barriers that prevent us from knowing our neighbors.<p>Another example, I would like to have a bulletin board that only covered the community where I live. Then I could post messages about the barbecues we have and I would finally be able to meet people that live around me.<p>Craigslist is ""true social"", and so are dating sites today. I would like to see the genre expanded.",1206111438

The US murder rate is 2.5 times greater than Canada's.*<p>I'm sure there are several reasons for this. There are two differences between US and Canadian society that I suspect could be important.<p>First, the wealth divide is much greater in the US than in Canada (or the UK). Social programs look out for the poor and reduce their desperation.<p>Second, the US almost uniformly rejects drug treatment as an alternative to long incarceration. Sending drug addicts to prison is just going to train them to become proper criminals.<p>*<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Canada#United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Canada#United_States</a>",1206111239
142460,comment,141898,141898,0,0,madgreek65,,,"Excellent article.  I am a lifelong corporate IT guy who has a life long fantasy of working in a startup company.  In my most recent job in which I have been on for 13 years, the IT  shop consisted of about 30 people when I started.  We were very entrepreneurial when I started and used to be rock stars who would crank out solutions for the business.  Now we are 200 people moving at snail speed spending most of our time on compliance projects, infrastructure upgrades, and mindless enhancements to monolithic systems.  It is hard to promote change because the status quo is rewarded.  As I walk the halls, many people look like they are serving time.  Management (which includes me) is always trying to foster innovation and new ideas.  But only the newer employees participate.  They have not assimilated yet.  I am sure after they hit the wall a few times, they to will walk with slumped shoulders.<p>So your article hit home and was a great read.  The next time I go to the zoo and look at the lion in the cage, I will realize that I am looking in the mirror.<p><a href=""http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/eai/madgreek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/eai/madgreek</a>",1206111190

What are stressful times? Times are always stressful for someone, somewhere.
What are unreasonable profits? Do you think the government should arbitrarily limit total net profit for any particular company? Or perhaps they should limit profit margins or return on capital? And any profit limits that apply to oil companies should also apply to software companies, right?

142433,comment,142274,142380,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I did a Swing project soon after Java 1.3 came out and kept finding odd bugs where the behavior of the code directly contradicted the behavior in the JavaDocs.  My experience was basically that if you didn't do things exactly as they did in The Java Tutorial, chances are it wouldn't work.  Or it'd mostly work, but with weird edge cases when you did something unexpected.<p>I asked my QA manager about this, and he said that the word on the street was that Java 1.3 was not QA'd.  They just made sure that the tutorial worked and pushed it out the door.<p>I've had similar experiences with Java AJAX frameworks.  The basic stuff from Sun (JavaEE, JSF) seems fairly robust, as long as you use it in the intended way.  But many of the add-ons like Facelets, A4J, RichFaces, etc. are made by small 2-3 person startups, and they don't QA or document their code at all.  Moreover, their code frequently makes functionality in the <i>base</i> JSF layers break (eg. you have to use ui:repeat instead of c:forEach with Facelets, and then you have to use a4j:repeat instead of ui:repeat if you add A4J).  Maybe that's changed since they were bought by JBoss, but it's something to keep in mind whenever you use bleeding-edge libraries by small teams.<p>So I'd amend that: start by assuming you're wrong, but if you can't find anything in your code, look at your dependencies in order of least-used -> most-used.  Chances are, software like Python or Apache or Java has been fairly well-exercised, and most of the bugs have been worked out.  But there's no reason to believe that JPartTimeOneDeveloperLibrary is any better than code you write yourself, and if you use untested projects like that, you should budget time to look through their source code and debug their problems and send in patches.<p>Unfortunately, sometimes managers get it into their head that a 3rd-party library is more reliable than it actually is, often because the vendor has the chutzpah to charge a hundred grand for it, and they mandate you use it.  This should be considered a bug in your manager, but unfortunately there's no fix for that...",1206109682

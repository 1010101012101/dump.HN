It is understandable when you see where Photos is coming from.<p>Google+ has proven successful with photographs since it had (at least at the time) an very good picture experience and an interaction model that worked well for communities. So they doubled down on photo features (not to mention that according to rumors, Gundotra is supposedly prone to claim some projects for his division).<p>Now that we have a full fledged photo product, it may be time to :  \n-separate it from Google+, even though g+ should still be backed by photos.\n-Merge as many google photo products as possible into this new experience.<p>Google has made some amazing work with auto awesome features (these automatic albums are slick) and the Photo editor, especially on mobile (where it is far from easy to build an editing pipeline, even if you use Renderscript).",1406987757

Logically, this means they would be most satisfied and happy if they didn&#x27;t have to make any choices or do any thinking at all, and something/someone else made all the decisions for them - the equivalent of having no freedom or control over one&#x27;s life.<p>You&#x27;re equivocating removing choices that one ultimately wouldn&#x27;t make any way (i.e. &quot;false choices&quot;) with removing all choice.<p>> Is this really what we want society to become?<p>Also slippery-sloping.",1406987716

There are 1.5 millions of civilians of Donetsk region that are excessive.<p>2. People of Donetsk region mustn&#x27;t be understood by the rest of Ukraine.

I excel at and enjoy lots of things and felt like school was making me commit to one field. I would spend days very inactive, stressing out about, for example, the pros and cons of being a game programmer versus an embedded software engineer or something. I could never seem to settle on one area. I thought game programming was a waste of engineering talent, but I found everything else about it extremely appealing. Luckily I&#x27;m over that crap now, as I accept what I knew all along: that it&#x27;s not what you major in that defines you. It&#x27;s what you do in life that matters. It also helps to be in a field that applies to virtually everything else (CS). I&#x27;d go even more crazy if I were in some highly specialized field.

8124879,comment,8124744,8124744,30,0,jordigh,,,"I want to add something here: great mathematicians compute too. They also know how to perform an algorithm. It is in performing, say, long division, that you start to notice things like when 10 is a primitive root modulo the divisor. Gauss spent his down time counting primes (in his head, he said). Riemann&#x27;s notes were full of haphazard computations. Amidst his scratch work where the Riemann-Siegel formula appears, there&#x27;s a computation of sqrt(2) to 38 decimal places for no discernible purpose. He probably was merely exercising, just like a musician practices scales. Erdős was able to memorise 10 phone numbers at a time from a glance at a phone book, amidst other calculating feats.<p>I hypothesise that offloading this brain work to a machine atrophies your cerebral muscles. Exercises left to the reader are really exercises in an almost kinesthetic sense.<p>The computations don&#x27;t have to be purely numerical: even a diagram chase in abstract nonsense is a valuable exercise. Computation frequently leads to insight. As children are adding two-digit numbers, they start to notice shortcuts about how to perform the computations. These are their own little private theorems, so to speak. So when Devlin here is talking about &quot;mathematical thinking&quot; and the less importance that performing algorithms has today, I hope we don&#x27;t forget that just because it&#x27;s less important, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not important at all.",1406986996

8124850,comment,8122138,8123332,1,0,DocSavage,,,"&quot;Being a physician isn&#x27;t really that hard.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s very hard.  It takes a lot of discipline and hard work to master all the prerequisites, all the knowledge necessary for the basic science component and then the clinical component, and then put in all the hours per week during med school rotations, post-grad residencies (especially internships).  That said, it&#x27;s mostly about the hours and volume of information and not so much about the intellectual difficulty, which you state... and then say all physicians are &quot;smart&quot;.  So instead of saying every physician is smart, I&#x27;d say most physicians have a good memory and the ability to work really hard.  If you can get reasonable grades in Comp Sci, you can certainly handle medicine <i>if you are willing to put in a lot of hours</i>.<p>I remember feeling so depressed watching the sun rise through a window next to an OR, having put in another really long day with not much sleep during a rotation.  At least in Comp Sci, you are building something, actively solving problems while doing an all-nighter.  In medicine, particularly at the med school level, you are doing something more trivial like holding a clamp for a while or asking people about their history.<p>IMHO the practice of medicine indeed sucks if you want a creative job.  Almost by definition, the practice of medicine requires you to not be creative unless you want to be sued for methods outside accepted practices.  There are a few truly gifted individuals who combine scientific research with a limited clinical practice, but to be at the forefront of both requires more talent and time management skills than I had.",1406985742

The owners of capital want to have a say about what the company does, because their money are at stake.<p>Perhaps this is just a cultural thing though. Take money lending - although a bank gives capital to someone else in exchange for profit, it doesn&#x27;t require strict controls over the actual use of the money; it relies on contract law to get the money back.<p>Similarly, the executives of the publicly traded companies have responsibility to shareholders. Perhaps a similar agreement could be institutionalized with the coops too (yet preserve their democratic nature).",1406985617

In a perfect market the most economically efficient organisation would win, end of story. What we&#x27;ve got isn&#x27;t that but it&#x27;s an approximation thereof. The closer it gets to fulfilling all the conditions the more likely it is that the outcome is economically efficient.<p>The only economy I&#x27;m aware of that had a lot of employee owned cooperatives was Yugoslavia. It worked better than Soviet bloc communism as far as resource allocation and living standards went but not as well as capitalism.<p>Co-ops don&#x27;t expand as much as privately or publicly held firms because they maximise something approximating profit per worker whereas normal firms maximise straight profits. I think I picked up that argument from Paul Krugman. It&#x27;s been a long time since I read the argument so I may be misremembering but he used Harvard and the UC systems as examples. Harvard doesn&#x27;t expand its student body, this maximises faculty utility, the UC system does, this maximises student utility.

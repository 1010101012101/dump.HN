This is why there is such movement towards online super-sized lectures: they want to teach an order of magnitude more people (charging them for the service).<p>The problem is that university administrations have tried to transform their institutions into profit-making businesses, and have insisted on cutting corners.  They are hell-bent on the notion of teaching an order of magnitude more students <i>without</i> hiring any more tenure-track professors.",1336359562

I do believe my boss had my best interests in mind, but you're probably right that it's easier to put someone ""in a box"" than it is reconcile the nuances of someone who evades classification.

3937374,comment,3936662,3937071,13,0,tolmasky,,,"What a strange example to choose since this is actually precisely what fast food companies do: the food at mcdonalds is designed around keeping you hungry despite eating it (its quite literally JUNK food). For example, a Coca Cola contains a ton of salt as well as sugar, so that your thirst is not quenched in the same way as drinking water. I'd list more examples but there is just so much literature around this now that a simple google search should suffice (even just watching Supersize Me would be a good start - -This movie is actually very related to your point as it deals with how McDonalds used to ask you to supersize, which is clearly a proactive position in making you eat vs. just not turning you away).<p>But even beyond that, there was just recently an article on how McDonalds is introducing snack wraps because they perceive that the best way to grow now is to convince people to eat at McDonalds BETWEEN meals as well. The article was basically centered around ""where does the biggest fast food chain go from here?"" (looking for link and will edit shortly if I find it). If you look at the advertising behind these new additions, they are trying to train people that they should eat these snacks in-between their other existing meals, ""on the go"". So basically, you're hypothetical is actually not devious enough: they've already been so successful at convincing their target market to eat all their meals at McDonald's that they now need to create <i>new</i> meals in order to grow!<p>Edit: I believe this was the article: <a href=""http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/23/why-mcdonalds-wins-in-any-economy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/23/why-mcdonalds-w...</a>",1336359405

3937362,comment,3935452,3936046,1,0,yangjerng,,,"Here I'm really interested in lowering barriers to mathematical education.<p>Target:<p>I'd like to see created for the JavaScript community, an equivalent of the Python-based/linked scientific and high-performance computing libraries (great lists of which are available at <a href=""http://sagemath.org/download-packages.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sagemath.org/download-packages.html</a>, <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific</a>). And I want that, because I'd like to make it easy for people who learn JavaScript to get into scientific and numerical computing without having to learn Python (& company). (I know it's easy to learn Python, as I basically did it at some point, but this suggests that perhaps it'll be easy to compile some restricted subset of JavaScript to Python.)<p>Hypothesised method:<p>I'm primarily interested in a new language with minimal difference from JavaScript, because the market (""human compilers"") I'm targeting are programmers who already know JavaScript. What I want to target those people for, is to give them a minimally different language in which to write code that compiles to faster C, in the manner that RPython and Cython do for Python. I'm willing to throw out a lot of JavaScript features, I just want to be careful to add a minimum number of features back in. I'll definitely be looking at Lua, Dart, ECMA Harmony (which has no formal date of release, or am I mistaken?), etc. as these are all close resemblances to contemporary (2012) implementations of JavaScript.<p>Questionable Motivations:<p>I'm personally willing to learn any language/toolset that gets things done faster (I'm learning Erlang myself, for this), but here, I am specifically interested in lowering the bar (sorry) for other people who may not have such willingness. This is just one of those ""want to have my cake, and eat it too, so I am putting some time into researching the problem"" situations. I have very limited prior experience in computer language design, but so far from a hacking-the-ecosystem point of view, the problem seems interesting enough to study, so, I hope to be doing more of that soon.",1336359139

So it was designed to support a relatively small number of retirees in their extreme old age. Then people began living longer.<p>Somewhat similarly, welfare was aimed at a tiny fraction of ""the deserving poor"" but was poorly worded/thought out and thus inadvertently changed the social contract and thereby actively grew the number of poor moms.

As opposed to what?\nas opposed to just using file_put_contents() and never checking for the number of bytes actually written. The point I was trying to make is that you could use quick, high level \nfunctions (like file_put_contents()) and then replace them with more low-level functions like fopen()/fwrite()/fclose() to have more fine-grained checking of errors (you could complain that the script failed to open the file when calling fopen() and then you could print the exact reason why, as opposed to just printing 'could not write to file' when using file_put_contents).<p>> How does a language using strlen equate to not getting in my way?\nI switch between languages pretty often and so keeping an active context for each language in my mind is rather difficult. I have to recall if it's len(), str.len(), str.length, str.length() and so on for every other type of task I need to deal with. If the language is really similar to C, it is more natural for me to use strlen() even if I have to come back to it after 6 months.

If I hadn't gotten married while still in school I probably would have gotten the double major and perhaps gone to graduate school in mathematics.  But my priorities shifted.  I found choosing a close runner up in order to better my family life to be superior.  Just as I would probably pass up on a promotion that would require me to travel 30% of the time.  For me my family is a passion.  For other people, having a nice house and nice toys is a passion.  As you said, it's all about optimizing rival objectives.  For me that optimization between my interests and having a family is software development.  That is purely from my perspective, but it's a choice I have made and there are consequences of that choice, both seen and unforeseen.<p>And that's the point.  Once we make a choice, we must accept the consequences.

But 3 are really local metropolitan papers that happen to cover cities that are of interest to the rest of the country (New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post).<p>But to give you an idea of perspective, USA Today, which circulates nationally, only moves about 1.8 million copies a day (in a country of over 300 million people). Local papers are <i>far</i> more important to most people and circulate many more copies than any of the national papers touch.<p>>By ""same political parties"", I mean that you know which is rep and which is dem. Which one will support your current president and which won't.<p>At the local level this isn't always true. Local politics in the U.S. can be tremendously parochial and can often not map well to national platforms. For example, in my area the local Republicans have been more focused on raising tax revenues to fund mass transit expansion than the Democrats -- almost the exact opposite of the National parties' focus. And I'm not talking about State level. County and District politics are local...or in cities districts or wards. It can be maddening to try and explain local or national political behavior by using one to explain the other.",1336356996

""One of the things you are are supposed to learn in economics is to avoid extremes. It is never all or nothing. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. And any way you jump has an opportunity cost because there are lots of things you would like to do with your limited means. So life is about trade-offs between rival objectives and you should optimise rather than maximise. "" - so said Ross Gittins, and there's much more where that came from.<p>so this supply-demand thingy - its just something that happens to accurately describe the current state of the world, or more particularly the usa, especially in a bubble where it is infinitely more preferable to drop out of college and pursue ruby on rails than stick it out for a lousy diploma with your name on it. but if an athlete wanting to compete in the olympics mistakenly walked into a circus and started jumping through hoops, the crowd would throw coin at him. he can then collect that coin & settle down, get married, raise a family, get a drivers license, buy an automobile, pay municipal state and federal taxes & so on. but that just means he's become a clown, not an athlete. it is unfortunate that athletics is non sexy and training to be one involves grueling practice for years and years in isolation with no attention, no fame, no coin. but to dodge that work and passion because of what society chooses to value at a particular point in time is quite defeatist. none of what we do in cs today would have been considered useful in the 20s and 30s. church and turing would have clearly been better off working in the railroads or digging an oil well. yet they did what they did, and here we are...\nso, respect. you never know what the future holds for medieval history or english literature. i spent 3 semesters as a film major before i dropped out, and i must say it was a royal blast. repeatedly watching blondes strip and run towards the beach in their red bikinis while their breasts bobbed up and down, and the professor of film studies pausing the remote at the critical instant when a tad bit of cleavage was visible and saying ""hey, <i>this</i> is why baywatch was a hit"" and all of us students scribbling down ""must place camera on sand level and tile up to show cleavage in beach shots"" - i mean, nothing beats that. no amount of fancy research in STEM will match the pure adrenaline that passes for film studies. so there's a reason people in their youth pursue these non-lucrative fields, so lets not rain on their parade.",1336356200

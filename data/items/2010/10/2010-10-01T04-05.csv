I also thought so myself, though it would look and maybe sound awkward with the parentheses, the original phrase should have precedence.<p>PS. I just read my comment noticed I may have come off as a Grammar Nazi or something like that. It was an honest interest on the rules of composing sentences with parentheses (which I don't know myself).",1285908965
1746069,comment,1745629,1746018,0,0,btilly,,,"No, actually here is what probably happened.<p>Bear Stearns created a small shell company with a detailed and interesting charter.  They loaned this company a large sum of money, in return for a set of bonds.  The company used that money to purchase the loans from Bear Stearns.  At this point Bear Stearns owns bonds whose value is approximately that of the loans.  (Actually slightly more because the bonds are structured to better meet investor's needs.)  They then turned around and sold the bonds to investors.<p>One of those investors (in theory it doesn't have to happen this way, but in practice it does) gets both the most risky piece of the investment, and a contract to run the company by rules specified in the company charter.  That investor is called the <i>servicer</i>, and they are responsible for the day to day activities of the company.  Which mostly consist of collecting loan payments, paying out the bonds, and making detailed records available to any properly qualified investor.  Once the last loan is gone, the company has no assets and goes away.<p>Your loan is now owned by the shell company (which has no employees and exists only to shovel income from loans and send them out again as bonds), which is run by the servicer.  JP Morgan Chase did not purchase any connection to this company when they bought Bear Stearns unless Bear Stearns chose to keep some of the bonds.  (They did keep some from many deals, and purchased some from deals they didn't do, so they may be an investor.)  Control is with the servicer.  However it should be noted that the servicer's hands are tied by the charter, and there is very little flexibility in how they can choose to run things.<p>Also note that once the deal goes bad, the servicer's incentive is to run the deal in whatever way maximizes the servicing fees they get.  This has proven to result in decisions that are counter to the interests of both investors and people who owe the loans.  For instance renegotiating a lower loan that people can actually pay generates less in servicing fees than taking a loan through bankruptcy court.  Therefore the servicer often prefers driving loans into bankruptcy even though that is worse for everyone else.<p>Now do you see why this is a mess?",1285908931

I found Google’s “study” pretty sketchy, given the lack of concrete detail about this. <a href=""http://code.google.com/speed/webp/docs/c_study.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/speed/webp/docs/c_study.html</a><p>Here’s some of what I wrote in an email to a friend:<p>Since they’re dealing with an arbitrary collection of already encoded images, there are likely e.g. artifacts along JPEG block boundaries that take up extra space in JPEG 2000. While they have a big sample size, they don’t compare the metric used (PSNR) with noticeable quality degradation.<p>There's a graph of size distribution (which would be a lot more readable if they binned some of the sizes and showed a histogram instead of a sea of overlapping red plus signs), but then compression percentages aren't in any way related to those various sizes: were big images easier to compress better than JPG/JP2? Small images? Looking at the size distribution, a large percentage of these images are absolutely tiny, the kinds of images that as far as I know JPEG 2000 was never intended to be used for. The overhead of the data storage container ends up dominating the size of the image for very tiny images – I don’t know anything about the relative overhead of JPG/JP2/etc. images, but it would be good to include that in any discussion.<p>It seems to me like the WebP images have their color profiles stripped. Is that an inherent part of WebP? If so, I hope Google doesn’t encourage people dealing with photographs to adopt it in large numbers. Browsers are just finally getting to the point where proper color management of images is expected; no need to regress there.",1285907997

Level3 does have to forward your announcement to its peers de-aggregated, though; that is, if they just fold it into their 4.0.0.0/10 announcement, incoming traffic will prefer your /24 announcement through GX because the prefix is longer/more specific, and plus that gives Level3 no way to withdraw the announcement if the link goes down.  Not everybody will happily let you punch holes in their nice, clean aggregate like that, potentially hosing their AS as a whole with flap dampening penalties and such if the link is flaky.  However, it is normal order of business with Tier 1s.<p>But yes, if you have an ASN, you can announce a /24 or bigger directly.  You can't do anything smaller, though I have the sneaking suspicion that may change.  There are some cranky network operators out there who have not upgraded to equipment with the horsepower and RAM (most importantly RAM) to hold a full BGP view consisting of prefixes down to the /24 granularity, and will indeed filter higher, but they're techically misrouting -- their problem.  In any case, that's not the norm, no.<p>If everybody filtered prefixes smaller than /19 or /20, then multihoming would be the province of a relatively small plutocracy of institutions.  I haven't run the numbers any time remotely recently, but most announcements, by volume, are of prefixes smaller than /19 for sure.<p>Take a look at this:<p><a href=""http://bgp.potaroo.net/as2.0/bgp-active.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bgp.potaroo.net/as2.0/bgp-active.html</a><p>If I'm reading ""Prefix Length Distributions"" right, 52% of all announcements are /24s, and average prefix length is 22.33.<p>Now, technically, what's being announced != what's being filtered by influential backbones.

Plus, it would be easier to establish that Yahoo is the leader in financial analysis and shopping results than trying to convince users that Yahoo can still hang with Google in search- it's an uphill battle not worth fighting.<p>After a bit of time passed, when it became visible what segments have potential, and what does not. It's time to cut. Surgically and decisively. The only way for Yahoo to compete in user-based web services is, in my opinion, to follow the Jack Welch method for cleaning up GE- cut everything that cannot make a reasonably stab at being the market leader. It saved GE from near certain doom. Under that same policy, GE has cut consumer electronics, their bread and butter for the first 50 years, but they are powerful and dominating in the spaces they do play in. Yahoo may have to ultimately drop search- it seems absurt to say it though. But as a company Yahoo has to trim the fat and cut the underperforming sectors.

Write a macro.<p>Don&#x27;t have &quot;thrush&quot; syntax? Write a macro.<p>Don&#x27;t have lazy evaluation? Write a... err. You can&#x27;t write a macro[1]. You can&#x27;t write something which completely changes the entire calling semantics of the language. What you can do is make a little sub-language which uses different values and objects from Lisp, but you can&#x27;t magically make the standard library support lazy evaluation.<p>Same with types and type inference (a la Haskell).<p>Same with many other things.<p>Of course, <i>obviously</i>, you can write a compiler that compiles to Common Lisp, or C, or Scheme, or COBOL. But writing a compiler -- while Lisp is good at that -- isn&#x27;t really taking advantage of what it usually means for Lisp to be extensible.<p>[1] For those who are ready to call out the many &quot;lazy&quot; libraries in Common Lisp, perhaps even my own, you&#x27;re missing the point. You can make a new version of DEFUN and a new version of FUNCALL. But that doesn&#x27;t make REMOVE-IF, SUBSEQ, MAPCAR, LIST, CONS, etc. lazy. As such, many, if not most, of the benefits that laziness brings, don&#x27;t get applied to the language at large.",1450749444

10775130,comment,10773824,10774219,0,0,interlocutor,,,"> But Windows apps (UWP) are still based on data binding.<p>Yes, I understand that Windows APIs still use two-way data binding. But by and large the developer community is realizing that two-way data binding is gimmicky and that in large applications two-way data binding is a liability. On the Web most JavaScript frameworks are moving away from two-way data binding (React, Angular 2, Ember, etc.) The reason for that has nothing to do with the Web or with JavaScript. The underlying reason is applicable to application development in general, regardless of platform.<p>Here&#x27;s Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz, developers of Ember, explaining their decision to move away from two-way data binding: <a href=""https://changelog.com/131/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://changelog.com/131/</a> (skip to 0:42)<p>Excerpts:--------------------<p>&quot;Why do people still prefer to write server-rendered apps? The programming model is just so easy. If you think about how people build sever-rendered apps.. the request comes in, you get your model data out of the database, you hand it to your view layer to render, you return that output  and that&#x27;s it. Every time you handle a new request, because HTTP is stateless, you start from scratch.<p>&quot;Conversely, things like Angular and Ember have two-way data bindings, right? And it really easy to end up in -- especially in a large or sophisticated application which is stateful.  As the user is looking at it, it&#x27;s not like the state is getting reset, you are constantly having to keep everything in sync yourself. It is easy to end up in a state where you can&#x27;t yourself explain how data flows through it.<p>&quot;The brilliance in react is bringing back a programming model that is as simple as server-rendered apps.<p>&quot;Even though both Angular and Ember have the notion of events and data bindings, data bindings feels so cool that people started  tunneling events through data bindings.<p>&quot;Honestly when I look at the critiques React people have about Ember and trying to understand, OK, you were an ember developer, you were reasonably productive, but you find yourself way more productive in React. What is happening? What we are finding -- and this played into the Ember 2.0 plan -- is that people are abusing two way data bindings to express something that is fundamentally an event.  A big focus of Ember 2.0 is moving away from two way data bindings as the primary method of communication to events. We added too much sugar around two-way data bindings and that led people to use two-way data bindings as an event bus.",1450748878

A generalist can become a specialist relatively quickly, especially when doing something day-to-day on a job. And often a generalist has benefit in understanding the big picture which aids in getting the job done.<p>Specialists have that edge in knowledge and often stay up to date better and general skills can erode quickly in areas of moving technology. This is useful when you need something worked on at the highest level right now and don&#x27;t have learning runway.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve avoided specialising as I like the work diversity, plus enjoy the employment opportunity of having a wider skill set.

Beyond that BPD and Asperger can have quite similar symptoms in terms of case book diagnosis (which often the only thing that most mental health professionals have to go by unless they have been treating the patient for chronically) as BPD often can exhibit similar emotional shortcomings (lack of empathy, being unable to recognize or reflect emotion) and irregular thinking as well as distractedness (which may also be interpreted as inability to properly communicate/hold conversation) and forgetfulness which often again can be attributed to several AAS criteria.<p>ASD/AAS while I&#x27;m sure are unpleasant (not trying to be patronizing just don&#x27;t have a better word for it) are not life threatening BDP however can be so while it&#x27;s quite unlikely you&#x27;ll take an advice from some internet smartass I would definitely get a second and even a third opinion in your case.",1450748302

Anyone studying PL, QA, and so on literature should have seen research on effectiveness of basic techniques. Here&#x27;s a few examples of methods of evaluation I claimed were scientific vs people guessing that their stuff seems better in vague ways.<p>1. Experiments conducted between similarly skilled groups doing same things with only difference being language or methodology. Those with new technique do significantly better in ways that match the expected properties of technique. Hypothesis based on real-world data, experimental confirmation, fix/reject if necessary, rinse, repeat.<p>2. Study of problems in software from a specific language identifies specific features as root cause, proposes a fix, the fix is implemented in significant test cases, and the problem goes away entirely or is significantly reduces. This is replicated across groups and codebases. Easiest example here is safe (Ada) or automatic (GC) techniques to manage memory to reduce or eliminate its many, common issues. Supported by theory, sometimes proofs, & countless applications in industry.<p>3. A certain verification approach espouses specific modeling, analysis, refinement, etc approach to achieve certain goals. The work on formal side translates into finding defects, enhancing performance, etc on the code side. Implies the model or method were correct, esp with diverse replication of results. This happened a lot in Orange Book days for catching security violations but most applicable to hardware with formal, equivalence checking. Theory, some proofs, and confirmation in production.<p>4. In some cases, properties are mathematically formulated, proven in theorem prover, checked by humans + machines, and tested on real-world examples to further validate them. Two words: type systems. Again, theories, proofs, and real-world validation. Tons of testing, too.<p>Most of the best evidence in the literature works something like that. You&#x27;re saying none of the above constitute scientific evidence for a claim about a software tool or method? That&#x27;s a big claim itself that contradicts what most of research community thinks. The people successfully finding bugs with Astree, avoiding out-of-bounds with languages that don&#x27;t allow it, catching safety violations with protocol checkers, and so on will all be surprised about your claim. They and I thought the tools would work based on evidence presented and field results that confirmed the theories. Turns out we were all drinking spiked Kool-Aid, leading to hallucinations that followed. Or wrong on a technicality.<p>Got a link that briefly explains why all of that is unscientific and what methods count as scientific evidence in software tools? (without 1hr videos)<p>Note: Looking up more on Quorum is on my agenda.  Already saved What Works Clearinghouse document. I&#x27;m not rejecting it outright in our discussion. Yet, you&#x27;ve indicated proven models, worked case studies, analysis techniques effective on 1+ million plus samples, mathematical proofs... that none of this is science.

The only reason this isn&#x27;t a problem right now is that the tech is still new. However, the last year of leaks and compromised databases has shown that the peace will not last.<p>> criminals will be criminals<p>Yes. <i>Exactly</i>. Which is why it is important to not let power concentrate, and the databases that advertisers are building (with Google and Facebook at the top) are a power that is new to the human experience.

The alternative to self regulation is some type of Butlerian Jihad (probably misguided and poorly targeted). This isn&#x27;t really hyperbole as these are two extremes and reality is usually somewhere in the middle. That said, when I talk to non-technical people about how modern tech works (adsense, other tracking by ad networks/etc, &quot;smart&quot; TVs, and other supposedly-&quot;free&quot; services), there is a common first reaction: &quot;Why aren&#x27;t they in jail?&quot;<p>> guns<p>Are a bad comparison in many ways.

However, advertising will never go away entirely, as it is <i>one of the useful funding models</i>.<p>My point in arguing is a refutation of the well-known fallacies and talking points in your initial post. You have argued against some (that advertising is in any way <i>passive</i> - as you say, it is &quot;meant to gain your attention&quot;). You have also made some <i>patently false</i> claims about power and anonymity (HTTP requests are generally not anonymous, even without the crazy tracking that the ad networks do). You also have made numerous claims that elevate advertising as the only or majority option for funding something on the network. I&#x27;ve already mentioned security above.<p>These specific claims are what I have a serious problem with. Quite a few funding models exist, and many variations are being explored. This is one of the huge benefits of modern technology: it made available so many more options in every area, including business models. The human experience with internetworking is still in its infancy, and I suspect we haven&#x27;t even discovered the <i>best</i> ways of utilizing the network for business purposes.",1450746903

So I have always been a little confused as to why web developers have struggled to write web apps using the same approach. The desktop apps I have worked on are easily bigger than any SPA I have ever seen. So I have not seen any issue with it working when scaling MVVM to large code bases.<p>Maybe there is something fundamentally different about web development and/or JavaScript that causes it to not work well?<p>For example, lets say you have a User model object. You want to display information about the user in three different places in the user interface. With MVVM this is simple. You have a single User model and three different VM instances that each point at the source model. Each VM has a matching View. Any change in the User model propagates down to the VM and then the View. If you edit the users name in the View it updates the VM and then the User model. Changes then cascade back down so the other two views update if needed. Very simple.<p>But how is this done in Flux/Redux? Does the store contain the user information just once? But then what about the intermediate information that is the equivalent of the three views? I presume you need to store this state information in some store as well. But then how do you handle updating the user and having the three other stores updated at the same time as needed?  I am not a web developer so this might be trivially simple to those that know how it fits together.",1450746751

2469492,comment,2469375,2469375,2,0,angusgr,,,"I actually think my honest opinion on this fiasco is ""someone can derive a user's movements from this database, but how big a deal is it really?""<p>I still think this should be fixed, Apple should explain it and release an update that pares it down to the bare minimum data for whatever function it serves.<p>However, let's honestly go through the implications of this:<p>- The user's cell provider already knows this. [1]<p>- If someone ""owns"" the user's phone then they can get their movement history. But that's at a point where they can track the user's current movements anyhow, so that's lose-lose there - the only difference is the historical angle.<p>- If someone steals the user's computer/phone they can get their previous history up until then. That's bad, but I bet nearly everyone has more sensitive private information available on their computer hard disk or their iPhone's internals - stuff that would be more exploitable than historical location data.<p>- Someone could maybe sneak private API calls into a legit app that sent this database somewhere else. No idea how feasible that is. However, if they can do that then it's pretty close to the ""ownage"" scenario described above - they can probably do anything anyhow.<p>If it comes out that Apple is sending this data back to Cupertino for some nefarious purpose then that is very bad as well, but I bet that's not the case.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2011-03/data-protection-malte-spitz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2011-03/data-protecti...</a>",1303361836

Here's what the problem has been thus far: do we focus on making the framework better, or do we focus on selling it? Personally, I'm much more comfortable with making sure we deliver the goods before we try to sell it. That's what SproutCore 1.5 is about. This is the first smoke signal of where we want to head with the framework, and people can take that for what it is. The core of the framework is amazing and fun to work with, but a lot of our demos are old and ugly. In many cases, our documentation has been or is still lacking and we're working on that too.<p>This obviously makes it a tougher sell. However, when people actually start building apps, their responses are overwhelmingly positive and they're very happy with their decision. I would much rather this problem than vise versa.

But here is my comment.<p>While you may be correct (and I think you are, because Apple has previously mentioned that they use such data to map tower locations) but I have a few counter points to your article (may not refute your main conclusion):\n1. Even Cell Triangulation can be way off depending on a lot of factors. I use it regularly on my Android phone with Tasker for some profile purposes and it gives me worse results most of the times than actually working with exact tower ID that I am seeing. I've seen it being as off as upto 5 kms<p>2. The location data is collected for other countries as well, not just for the parent network within US. Out of the various articles from various people, they have seen data from all places where they used cell services, including abroad like Japan, India, etc. The data only seems to be missing when they don't have a cell service.<p>3. What irks me is that why they need to store this data on the device and PC? Even if they were building their own cell tower database, it should be done and done once apple gets the data. Why would they keep a whole history about it on the phone and PC? Maybe it is an oversight? But I can't find any reasonable explanation for this.",1303360768

I'm sure the rest (MACs, tower IDs, etc.) can be used to triangulate a better fix based on what's visible and what signal strength to each location is like.<p>The device caches this information locally because the Lat./Long. of a cell tower / AP will not change - but the timestamp for the last time your phone has ""seen"" it could be updated, without having to re-hit Apple's servers for the details.<p>It's being done because: storage is cheap, the amount of data doesn't take much space for thousands of points, it reduces server talk, and it speeds up your GPS/location acquisition for apps that you wish to use it with.<p>Apple's only mistake is that they didn't encrypt this information.

2469431,comment,2462224,2463466,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,"I don't mean to say that people use the micro-steps all the time. What I mean is that, on initially learning something, those that ""get"" it subconsciously break it down into micro-steps that are just small enough for them. This builds the bridge from what they know to what they're learning. Once the abstraction or technique makes sense, then you apply it as a whole on further usage.<p>I think one of the main things that separates the quick learners from the slow learners is how much breaking steps into micro-steps can be done unconsciously. The data lends weight to this. Teaching a concept in micro-steps doesn't help the smartest people learn it better, but it brings the slow learners up to speed. The difference is how small the steps have to be for the students' unconscious to make the connections and thus reach ""understanding"".",1303359238

No wifi points anywhere close. Just like the chosen example.<p>I bet its entirely different when you're in any kind of built-up area. Wifi points every few hundred meters, small cell towers every kilometer or two. I bet in those situations, someone could derive a pretty close record of ""your moves"". Even if the individual points jump around, you're presumably hopping cells and seeing new Wifi APs every few minutes - even when you're just walking around your house or your office - and that data can be triangulated.<p>I think the OP is right inasmuch as Apple probably didn't set out to track users as much as keep track of connected wifi & cell APs.

It describes a library world in which all possible n-character strings from a 22-letter alphabet, for large n, are written in books. This has <i>very</i> low information content -- I could write a program to print the library's contents in a few lines of code -- so I don't see what the big deal is. (I'm using the Kolmogorov complexity definition of information content here, which I think is the most useful.)<p>Any filing system which can precisely specify any given book from the Library must contain within each specification (on average) exactly as much information as a given random sequence of n characters -- the catalog numbers have to be as long as the book itself!

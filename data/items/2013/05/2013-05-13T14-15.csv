This is also cool for endusers to see who made the last change etc.<p>Trying to reverse engineer how some data got into a messed up condition using logs that can be JOINed to actual data tables as necessary is pretty easy, compared to trying to write a webserver log file parser to read multiple files to figure out who did what, when, to the data resulting in it being screwed up.

5699003,comment,5698352,5698352,30,0,flyosity,,,"I wrote the tweets featured in the article and thought I'd chime in with a few more thoughts...<p>I think flat design is inclusive design, that is, it's not hoity-toity, impossible-to-execute, beautifully 3D-rendered and textured expensive design. It's simple and clean, sparse and understandable. In the most simple application of ""flat design"" trends, it's essentially one step up from a wireframe: pick a color scheme on some color scheme website, download a 200-pack of glyph icons and BAM you've moved from an abstract wireframe to something a little more sophisticated and approachable. Friendly colors, nice spacing, good typography, and you've got something.<p>Yes, I am saying it is quicker to execute a ""flat"" design than it is to execute a skeuomorphic, highly-stylized, deeply-textured design. A product manager or developer without a lot of design experience could probably use some flat design trends and one nice font and put something together that doesn't look like horse shit. I don't think that same product manager could spend an equal amount of time trying to mimic a beautifully-crafted and textured interface and have anywhere near the same luck. Using flat design trends gets you to some sort of product design quicker than if you're spending 20 minutes crafting a 5-color gradient to emulate the perfect lighting of a semi-glossy aluminum rod for your button texture.<p>No, I am not saying that by simply using ""flat"" design trends you are able to bypass all processes and thinking surrounding good whitespace, grouping, contrast, alignment, typography, usability,  etc., but because ""flat"" design elements are graphically simpler it lets the content of the design show through and not be muddled by textures or skeuomorphic execution flaws, so your design message is clearer and cleaner by default.<p>Non-designers or ""mediocre designers"" seem to be flocking to these flat design trends the same way they flock to the excellent Bootstrap framework: because it's a simple way to jumpstart a product design out of a blank canvas or browser window into something that, even when starting out, looks pretty decent.",1368457071

In return, theoretically, they are supposed to be non-political.</i>""<p>No, no a thousand times no; per <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#Types"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#Types</a>:<p>There are 27 types of 501(c) organizations, ranging from the familiar ""501(c)(3)  Religious, Educational, Charitable, Scientific, Literary, Testing for Public Safety, to Foster National or International Amateur Sports Competition, or Prevention of Cruelty to Children or Animals Organizations"" to the obscure ""01(c)(27)  State-Sponsored Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Organization"".<p>The fuss here, to my knowledge, is about 501(c)(4) organizations, ""Civic Leagues, Social Welfare Organizations, and Local Associations of Employees"".  Quoting Wikipedia:<p>""<i>501(c)(4) organizations are generally civic leagues and other corporations operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, or local associations of employees with membership limited to a designated company or people in a particular municipality or neighborhood, and with net earnings devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes.  501(c)(4) organizations may lobby for legislation, and unlike 501(c)(3) organizations they may also participate in political campaigns and elections, as long as its primary activity is the promotion of social welfare. The tax exemption for 501(c)(4) organizations applies to most of their operations, but contributions may be subject to gift tax, and income spent on political activities - generally the advocacy of a particular candidate in an election - is taxable.
Contributions to 501(c)(4) organizations are usually not deductible as charitable contributions for U.S. federal income tax, with a few exceptions. 501(c)(4) organizations are not required to disclose their donors publicly.</i>""<p>So, everyone, please, recognize that these are not the theoretically apolitical 501(c)(3) organizations you may be most familiar with (Wikipedia goes into some detail on this) but organizations that are <i>explicitly</i> allowed to engage in political activity, with corresponding disadvantages in losing tax deductibility for it.<p>To use the example I'm most familiar with, the National Rifle Association, the NRA proper is a 501(c)(3), it runs target shooting, training, safety instruction, a whole lot of apolitical stuff.  Their lobbying organization, the Institute for Legislative Action, is a 501(c)(4).  They have a separate political action committee (PAC) that following the usual rules donates (now small, since the limits weren't inflation adjusted) sums directly to politicians (which I take to be mostly symbolic, not ""buys the politician"" ... if for no other reason than few if any stay ""bought"" :-).

Even though bias is present at all stages of the process, that includes even shot selection to begin with so presence of bias alone is not an indicator of which side of the line a particular image might be.<p>Obviously the first step is to determine whether an image is being passed off as a documentary photograph or an art photograph.  Almost no one cares whether a photo of Sheryl Sandberg in TIME is heavily doctored (i.imgur.com/lFwMNia.png).  Presumably, the photos in the contest were.  This was a photographic report of a real and notable event.<p>Then the question is whether the modified elements of the photograph are relevant to the associated story.  In most cases, filters and contrast are not relevant; although they could be in some edge cases.  For touch-ups and smudging, the question is what are you touching up and smudging?  A minor blemish on someone's face might not be relevant, but replacing a rifle with flowers could be substantial.  A composite to eliminate someone's eyes being closed doesn't change the substance, but eliminating someone's presence entirely would be substantial.<p>Of course, a competition might have even stricter standards but from a consumer standpoint, that's where the line should be.  An artistic collage photo meant to concisely tell the story of an event is fine, even if it LOOKS like it's almost real, but the nature of the photo should be disclosed.  It shouldn't be passed off as a documentary photo.",1368456094

Do you really have a newsworthy photo of an athlete winning the race if you digitaly process a photo of from a previous competition to make it look like it is from today? Is it more newsworthy because it's yesterdays images of dead children instead of yesterdays athletes?<p>> Personally I don't see a single clear line where you should stop so I think that it should probably be spelled out in the competition rules.<p>Unfortunately, morally corrupt photographers will claim their manipulated images are following the rules, even when they are not.

You might be surprised.<p>This statement shows the kind of damage Java has done to the larger programming community.<p>Let me tell you the reason why people shudder to use to Java for things like text processing. To do as simple a task- to simply read from a file, do minimal processing(like extracting fields) and write to another, you have to deal with tens of api calls often with long names. Its extremely difficult if not impossible to remember each and every api call and the order they need to called in. So the net result is every time you need to do something, no matter how simple. You simply go to the internet, get a known-to-work-well template and just copy-paste it into your code.<p>And this is just the beginning, a sufficiently large Java application can be totally incomprehensible to understand, modify or develop without an IDE. Far too many nested api calls, far too much XML. Bulk of Java code today in the wild is machine generated and machine modified(I mean through IDE's)<p>Java these days feels like assembly language programming. You have to play with far too many api's to do even the simplest of the tasks.<p>No wonder people flock to a dynamic language at every chance they get.",1368455805

There were over 100,000 photos up in the competition, and prizes were awarded to photographers of 33 nationalities (with a notable absence of Israelis).  Other photos bringing other stories (and maybe even the same story) from Gaza and elsewhere in the world could have won instead.  The whole point of a photography contest is to identify and recognize those photographers who can skillfully identify and catch dramatic moments and angles in split second, not those who take otherwise normal pictures and edit them later.<p>To give some balance, the day these two brothers and their father died, there were continuous rocket attacks on Israel.  At around 7pm, a rocket hit a high school in Ashkelon.  A student from the school told the reporter, ""We were playing soccer near the school and suddenly there were sirens, and we saw the Iron Dome rocket fire above us, and then we heard a large explosion and we realized it fell just near us.  The police came and we directed them.""  The rocket fell on the rooftop of a nearby school building unexploded and was disarmed by the police.  The IDF later released a statement saying it attacked over 50 tunnels and tens of hidden rocket launchers.  The Hamas often places the rocket launchers near civilian homes for protection and this might have been the cause of the attack.  The civilians, as perhaps the Hejazi family in this case too, have no real say and are sometimes forced to remain near the weapons against their will.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.worldpressphoto.org/content/swedish-photographer-paul-hansen-wins-premier-photo-contest-award"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldpressphoto.org/content/swedish-photographer-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/2689/2587705"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/2689/2587705</a> (live blog from the day of the attack, Hebrew)",1368455640

(1) ""jgc is not saying he believes the photograph has been staged, but that it looks like it has been"". (2) ""In other words, how did a photo that is so obviously fake win a photography contest?""<p>So, is he saying that it is fake (and ""obviously"" so), or that it merely ""looks fake""?<p>And, may I ask, what is that ""obviously fake"" about it, besides color adjustments?<p>Now, it's true that color adjustment is frowned upon in certain news circles, but it's used a lot in magazine reporting, and it's not that different than what you could achieve with your choice of camera (or film in a previous era). That kind of alteration might, or might not, be acceptable for a photo competition.<p>As for ""obviously fake"" as in ""he staged it by putting the people in a specific position"", ""had lights"" etc, I don't see any signs about that -- or even find it that possible given the circumstances. Those are not some ""damn arabs, doing PR work and pretending to be sad and enraged"". Those are parents, neighbors and friends, holding their dead children. The way some people commented here, they might as well been subhumans in the picture.<p>For the composition part, if a photographer is half competent, he can get a very good composition out of such as scene without even trying.

5698749,comment,5696978,5698532,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"There are different kinds of assholes and bullies. Also, they aren't the same thing.<p>The boss who loses his temper a lot but doesn't engage in prolonged campaigns of harassment is the archetypical ""asshole"" boss, but not a bully. People realize he's a ""Volcano"" (see here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/gervais-macleod-23-managers-mentors-executives-cops-and-thugs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/gervais-macle...</a> ) and his credibility drops, so he is really only a danger to himself after a while. As long as you can tolerate superficial verbal abuse (and not everyone can, but I can deal with it at this point in my life) you're not at major risk of long-term career harm from the Volcano/Cartoon Asshole.<p>The asshole wants, out of work, things that normal people want (money, prestige, accomplishment, progress) and just goes about getting them in an emotionally retarded way. He can't persuade people or lead, so he falls back on abuse, but he doesn't actually enjoy hurting people (he might not care much about others' emotions, or he might be utterly blind to his effects on other people, but he's not sadistic). Bullies are different; they actually enjoy destroying people. They like abusing power even more than they like getting rich or climbing the ranks.<p>Assholes can be worked around. Even if one gets you fired, your reputation will usually be intact. In fact, you're likely to get sympathy because people who know their reputations are impressed that you held out for that long. ""Really? You worked for <i>him</i> for 15 months?"" Bullies are different, in that they deliberately ruin your reputation, and because they're selective in their choices of whom to attack, they keep their credibility intact. Workplace bullies know that they can only target a small number of people, and only the socially weak (new guys, young people, women) and they're superficially nice to everyone else, so they end up with sterling reputations.<p>Bullies are nice to everyone except the people they perceive as being weak. The danger is that most people will have moments of (usually transient) weakness. A bully boss can turn transient weakness (a health problem, a failed startup, child-raising complications) into a permanent career smear.<p>I worked for one of these at Google. He was superficially very nice, but he sabotaged people. I investigated him quite a bit while I was there, and after I left, got access to a bunch of shit I shouldn't have been able to see. He had an HR record as long as my forearm of using fake performance problems to tease out reports' health problems, rescheduling meetings to conflict with peoples' medical appointments; but HR did nothing because he had a superb reputation for ""delivery"" on projects (mostly because he was a great blame-shifter). I was weak at the time because I was coming off of a failed startup. Had it not been for that, I doubt I would have been his target.<p>Also, it's a misconception that a workplace bully is only going to do typical boss things in the nastiest way. They deliberately interfere with work performance. Bully bosses don't let you go off and do great things but give negative reviews. (That's an asshole boss having a shitty day.) They actively make it impossible for you to perform, so it looks like you melted down and that they had nothing to do with it.<p>Yes, if you're attacked by one of these, you're off the Sheryl Sandberg track for good. It doesn't mean that you'll never have a decent career. It does mean that you're out of the running for CxO implants into existing enterprises-- you need a smear-free career history for that, unless you go full-on Don Draper-- and now that VC-istan is fully corporate, you're probably not fundable either.",1368454501

For example, i work in embedded software, mostly for relatively large machines (ATMs, multifunctional copiers, industrial machines that turn stuff into other stuff), and Linux isn't <i>that</i> common there. The most common setup is some (micro)controller with RTOS for the nitty-gritty stuff, hooked up to a Windows box for the display panel and outside communication. There's plenty other examples of tech that mostly isn't Linux. Cars? Sliding doors?<p>Second, to answer your question, i do think the FOSS flames are harder and nastier than the win/osx platform wars.

That service would be maintaining the authoritative record of who owns how many shares of the company.</i><p>I don't think there's any reason to think that exchanges' main purpose for existence is to provide service to publicly traded companies. Exchanges are just a store, and their purpose is to buy/sell stuff and make a profit. So, in that sense, having multiple exchanges selling the same stock is the same as having multiple bike stores selling the same bike...it's competition and there aren't many downsides to it.<p><i>As for the social cost, you do realize that HFT does not come for free to society. At a minimum, society must somehow pay for those well-paying jobs to developers. And what do those developers give back to society? Before you answer, please consider whether you should distinguish between algorithmic trading and HFT. I do believe that algorithmic trading is useful to society (because it can do the job that screaming traders used to do better and cheaper), but the subset of HFT is not useful.</i><p>Nothing comes for free to society. Funding a never-ending number of failing start-ups doesn't come free to society either. What is that giving back to society? Your implication is that HFT trading is somehow <i>taking</i> something from society that it doesn't deserve. What is it taking? Also, in terms of making distinctions: HFT is the superset and AT is the subset, not the other way around. All AT shops are HFT shops, but there are actually quite a few HFT shops that don't run algorithms and instead run based on inputs controlled by traders.<p><i>The only things anyone ever seems to be able to answer for HFT two-fold: one, that stock prices change faster, and two, that the spread is smaller. </i>
This is the crux of the whole thing. Why does anyone have to <i>answer</i> for HFT? This is implying that HFT is hurting people however you haven't not given any proof of this (besides that it doesn't <i>add value</i>). If anything, I think HFT's biggest crime (as someone else has mentioned) is that sucks some really smart people into working on problems of a rather limited scope.",1368453826

I hadn't really meant to offer it as a final solution to all our problems.<p><i>>I can also see that lenders might exert their influence in ways you'd find objectionable, </i><p>If the gov't decides to use economic forces to manage the supply of college grads, I would hope that a large portion of funding would go into very productive areas. It should/would likely change over time to correct oversupply, changing demographics of society, etc.<p><i>>making lending predicated on family assets/income, requiring co-signing from a parent with a 650+ credit score, </i><p>An unfortunate but predictable outcome. Ideally, a parent with a 650+ credit score would be able to afford to support a child in college w/o much support. I have such a credit score, but probably won't be able to educate my kids based on my college instructor salary alone. Ironic, eh?<p><i>>not lending to liberal arts majors at all,</i><p>Funding the arts via loans is right out, obviously. Funding the arts is a problem that has spanned pretty much all of recorded history. No simple scheme such as mine can pretend to solve it today. Attempting to use economic/market forces in the normal manner to produce good art will only ever have comical results at best, and the nominal result will be crap. (I have an amusing idea. I'll tell it further down.)<p><i>> refusing to lend at ""black colleges"",</i><p>Grants? Be prepared to write off a lot of the ""loans"" to minority and impoverished areas. Since they are minorities, it will be cheap anyway. We could probably do away with race-based affirmative action, and simply make grants to students and institutions in impoverished places, and from impoverished families.<p>> or preferentially lending at Ivys, etc.<p>I'm also not sure how to effectively stop the well-connected wealthy from sponging off of everyone else. I could say ""means testing"" but we both know that these types of parasites are clever and quickly adapt to their environment. Hopefully if the rich use loans, the majority will repay them, and thus be a source of income rather than a drain. More likely, their parents will hire expensive accountants to help rid their heirs of this debt, justifying this thievery because it is ""so unfair"" to ""tax success.""<p><i>>Of course, they'd do it in the name of lending to high paying, high demand job skills and high likelihood of repayment.</i><p>Yeah, so, at least we agree that there may be a possibility for a pseudo-private-ish loan outfit to be somewhat profitable for some higher-ed funding.<p><i>> Under such a system, I'd have still gotten loans, </i><p>I could have gotten loans too, but I refused (for better or worse, I'm not sure). I had negative/neutral financial support from family, and eventually dropped out of Uni before completing my BS. meh.<p><i>but I'd rather see a system where some percent of people who make bad choices suffer from their choices, but where educational loans are widely available than a system where few are ""allowed"" to make bad choices, but loans are more narrowly available.</i><p>I don't want to see people suffer, but I don't think that's what you really meant. I think it would improve our economy, and the lives of many people if some of us were economically herded into productive industry. I know, it almost sounds like communist central planning, and it probably is. But letting high school seniors choose the economic direction of our country at their whim seems like a poor alternative.<p><i>I don't want a world that's even more ""rich get educated, poor don't"" than today. </i><p>Me neither.<p><i>If I look back at my family, my generation is much, much better off, primarily via education, than my grandparents who very literally mined coal and worked in a steel mill. They scrimped and saved so my parents could go to college to become teachers, who in turn ensured we did as well. That's no college to no-name college to top-name college in the span of two generations.</i><p>Yes, it's so obvious that it shouldn't need to be said. Education will improve everyone's life to a greater degree than pretty much anything else.<p><i>Of course that's only one data point, and if I read it in a paper, blog or on news.YC, I'd roll my eyes at the cherry-picking, too, because it'd be 1 story hand-selected from 100s of millions. In my case, it's 1 of 1, so I want to ensure we preserve the conditions that let my parents work hard to forge a better life for themselves and my siblings.</i><p>Let's call this a friendly chat over coffee, and overlook these misdemeanors.<p>* Maybe in a world where college loans are hard to get (such as the world they lived in), this would all work out similarly, *<p>I think it needs a systematic approach. The colleges themselves have to adopt ethics. It will be tough, you can't really outlaw meanness, wanton greed, stupidity.<p><i>and easy college loans are in fact part of the problem,</i><p>Greedy businessmen are sucking this money out of kids' pockets as fast as the kids can borrow it. I see it every semester. Students pay 2X, 3X, 10X, prices for books, computers, supplies, etc. because the campus store is integrated with the school and makes spending that money much easier than buying used texts from individuals, the internet, etc. The bookstore stocks lab items for my courses, but at a huge markup over retail. Next to every nasty decrepit warm-water fountain is a vending machine full of cold Dasani(TM), or better yet Coke!### Prices at the ""food court"" are another outrageous example. Privately financed campus housing? The same.<p>* but I think there's been heaps of hidden benefits to having education being more widely available and more common that people overlook when they see Mr or Ms Bad Choices as an adult with untenable student loan debt.*<p>Absolutely, but, I think that was probably true to a greater degree in the past, and that the [education funding] system for people in our cohort (middle-class-ish?) is tending more toward a sort of Hobson's choice of debt-slavery / indentured servitude vs. forgoing formal education.<p>## Arts funding should be fragmented from education funding. It should be as independent as possible from political influence. There could be divisions administered by appointees (appointed for life) who would primarily give block grants to institutions of their choosing. Funding divisions could be run in a variety of ways, but at least one should be required to only make funding decisions while under the influence of mind-altering drugs. Now that I think of it, the same arrangement might do well for science funding (especially Physics).<p>### Unless Pepsi has the vending ""contract""",1368453705

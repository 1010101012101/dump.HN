However it only eliminates supply for one possible solution. Employees will still need to get to work and Google and other companies will still be willing to find ways to make their employees happy.<p>This leaves room for a company like Uber or Google themselves to introduce a corporate carpool service and app where employees could leave their house roughly when they want and not have to walk to a bus stop. Employees would use a special version of Uber (or similar app), where they ping for a driver. Uber automatically groups three employees who are leaving from approximately the same time and region and picks them up in front of their home and shuttles those ~3 employees to Mountain View.<p>Attacking busses is easy. Attacking a corporate limo service is nigh on impossible without attacking every San Franciscan who makes a living from driving (taxis, lyft, uber, sidecar, etc.).<p>Under this scenario, Google would have to foot a marginally higher transportation bill, but employees will be happier since they will get picked up in front of their homes, get to come and go when they want and they will spend less time commuting since the vehicle only needs to stop for three people in quick succession and then proceed to Mountain View directly with no additional stops.<p>I reckon this service would cost Google approximately $50 per employee per day at scale with 3 people per vehicle, which is about $13000 a year per employee. With larger vehicles like suburbans, this would be even cheaper. When the average revenue per employee is about 7 figures, this is a no-brainer to implement.<p>With respect to Google specifically, this also gives them access to a large fleet of vehicles commuting daily. Since they are in the self driving car market, it&#x27;s an obvious group which which to rack up hundreds of thousands of miles. This would could be the basis of the largest case study for allowing driverless cars on the road.",1392101022

7216170,comment,7211341,7214941,4,0,ebiester,,,"There are two potential problems posed in the scenario:<p>The first, as I believe you presume, is that the business is looking to develop a revenue-generating product. I agree that  Continuous delivery, quick iterations, late-binding requirements (a la Behavioral Driven Design), and rigorous testing are not a strong candidate for this problem within the context of big business, and I can point to a handful of systems where this approach did not work well.<p>However, the second interpretation is that a big business has ten internal projects to increase their efficiency. In this case, return on investment is relatively easy to calculate, but requirements are usually nebulous and thus estimates are by necessity high-variance.<p>I think the subset of agile techniques I described (as well as cross-functional teams, high customer involvement, and exploratory testing) are well suited to this problem because they, as a collection, allow a business to receive value quickly and allow the business to &quot;fail fast&quot; in lean startup parlance.<p>Are you building embedded software? The agile approaches aren&#x27;t, collectively, well suited for that domain (though I&#x27;d argue pair programming and cross-functional teams aren&#x27;t a bad idea here.) It&#x27;s not going to work for games. But for internal software and <10 client software, I argue that this subset reduces risk and increases the potential of high ROI.\n___<p>Now, as for a few things you mention.<p>* The programmers are not responsible for calculating return on investment. However, does an extensive requirements gathering mission with months of meetings going to be cheaper when the costs of meetings (in lost productivity and wages) is calculated? In my experience, these documents end up being works of fiction, on which aggressive estimates are produced upon pressure of management. Then, the costs overrun (especially considering that nobody accounted for the lost productivity of the customer) because the estimate  was based on business need rather than reality. Then, features are dropped and technical debt accrues, leading to a system that is hard to maintain and is scrapped after five years of frustration when the customer starts again. At least, this time they know what they don&#x27;t want. I don&#x27;t think that works.<p>* I think that is the situation that leads to the &quot;red&quot; projects that you mention. However, you speak about early days of software where most software was profitable. However, I&#x27;ve seen and heard the horror stories of multi-million (and Billion!) dollar projects from the 80s and 90s. While <a href=""http://calleam.com/WTPF/?page_id=1445"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calleam.com/WTPF/?page_id=1445</a> mentions recent studies, I remember seeing studies that 2/3rds of projects fail in the 80s and 90s as well.<p>So, most software wasn&#x27;t profitable then (at least in terms of internal projects) and they aren&#x27;t now.<p>However, I&#x27;d argue that the collection of techniques above allow a project to fail faster and cheaper if managed correctly.<p>If we were to put it into a methodology, here it is:<p>1. Determine return on investment if X can be automated. How many hours are saved? How many fewer people are needed to do the same job? What percentage better forecast can this project create (estimated)<p>2. Use some sort of behavior driven development to get a basic sense of the complexity of the system needed. If the complexity and ROI don&#x27;t match up, stop here. You&#x27;ve lost a minimum amount of money.<p>3. Start prioritizing which pieces would provide the most business value for the least complexity cost. Build the first of these pieces, elaborating on the BDD done in step 2. Write this with good tests, so that the system can be extended with a reduced fear of later regression.<p>4. Demo to customer. Does this fit their needs? Is additional complexity exposed? Does this provide value? This is the next cutoff point. If the system appears to be more complex than thought, or if the team is unable to provide the business value anticipated, stop the project and re-evaluate or shelve.<p>Everyone gets together and does a retrospective with a question to continue, an honest look at what worked and what didn&#x27;t, and a set of things to try to fix the problems of the first iteration.<p>5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the software either sufficiently meets the business need or the project is ended early due to a fatal flaw. Always be willing to ask if this is the appropriate time to declare the system &quot;done for now.&quot; \n___<p>Now, this won&#x27;t work in most major corporations for a variety of political reasons, but to me this seems to be a better system than the traditional corporate project structure from my experience in both successful and unsuccessful IT projects.",1392100470

A 4 page &quot;chapter&quot; is something more akin to a &quot;section&quot; or some other unit. The sample PDF has the first two chapters, each of which are basically a page each (plus a large image). I&#x27;d recommend redefining your definition of &quot;chapter&quot; and restructuring into fewer/longer chapters. As it is it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s actually much meat there, particularly for a $30 PDF.<p>As I think about it more, a simple restructuring might not be enough for that kind of price. $30 is more than the retail price for a lot of 300+ page technical books (years ago I wrote a 400 page book with a print version that retailed for $30).",1392099401

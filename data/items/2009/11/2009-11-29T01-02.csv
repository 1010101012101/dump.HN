I'm not saying social change never happens from the bottom up, but for me, this pledge is just one step up from, say, an internet petition.  Show me one internet petition that has ever made a meaningful difference, and I will change my mind about this topic.<p>I do the best I personally can, but I don't think changes to business ethics can come from within, because too often ethical businesses put themselves at a disadvantage and fall behind.  Whenever changes aren't directly aligned with business interests, they have to come from outside forces - whether it's legislation, or pressure from society, or both - and be applied evenly to all businesses.  That's how we've got all progress so far, and I don't see it changing any time soon.",1259459472

This is why it's expected for you to present your methods, data, math, and then your conclusions.  Ignoring malice a tiny mistake can drastically change an experiments outcome.  So an experiment yet to be independently verified is next to worthless, but it's not sexy to work like that and it does not help your reputation.<p>Edit: IMO, what's missing from this discussion is the idea that independently verifying their results is a reasonable thing to do.  This does not mean plugging their numbers into their code and looking at the results but starting from scratch using their methods and testing it yourself.<p>PS: One of the reasons that social science has such a poor reputation is the willingness to accept minuscule sample sizes as representing real research.  A little less trust would go a long way to revitalizing those fields.  Unfortunately neuroscience seems to be falling for this trap.",1259457236

The people who need the pledge the most are also the least likely to follow it when it's really put to the test.<p>That's why reading about the HBS pledge was one of the few times I laughed out loud - long and hard - at something I read online.  Maybe I'm too cynical.<p>The article's tone is a bit hard to swallow, but I think the point about ""externalities"" is valid.  In other pledge-driven professions (medicine, engineering, I'm guessing law) the interests of the professional tend to be aligned with the contents of the pledge - or, at least, not usually in direct conflict.

Now that worked in a world where content was intended to have an unlimited lifespan ie- music, youtube videos,etc.  With livestreaming video, the damage is done within a few hours or less.<p>Livestreaming sites have put content fingerprinting technology in place and often respond very fast to takedown notices.  Even the fastest of responses will still cause damage.  So does that mean JTV puts in a system where content owners can just start taking things down at all like ebay does with auctions?  I don't know, that's scary.<p>I would never cancel cable because I can watch sports on a livestream site.  The quality is usually crap with foreign commentary.  Odds are the people watching that content don't have cable anyway (like myself).<p>There are two missing pieces to the content side of things when it comes to shifting people away from cable subscriptions: local news and sports.  Local news could be solved in a fairly straight forward manner.  Sports is up to each league,etc.  If I were the NBA, NFL, MLB,etc. I would start working with livestreaming sites to do test runs of pay per view content.  Once most sports games are ubiquitously available on the internet in real time and for replay Comcast should be scared.  If Comcast actually had their shit together, they would have purchased JTV/Ustream/Livestream when they were cheap.<p>Right now, the real value of live video isn't from illegal sports or content, its from real time interaction.

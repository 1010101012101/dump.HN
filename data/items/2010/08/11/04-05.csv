I'm 27 & I work from home. The upside is that I have a place to live and work comfortably, I'm not broke and I can support my ""startup habit"". The downside is that I never get much sleep, my girlfriend hates it, almost everyone I know says that I should quit my startup and get married like a normal person, my student debt isn't going anytime soon, and the stress of that and everything else never seems to subside much these days.<p>Overall though, I feel like the chips are up for me right now. I've been in a spot once or twice in the past where I felt pretty desperate and depressed like you have mentioned. There's few things worse than professional failure with conveniently ill-timed personal trials happing simultaneously.<p>Luckily, this time around I've prepared a little more for the hard times that might soon come due to professional trials. Also, my past hardships have helped me prepare better mentally, knowing that I've pulled myself out of slumps before and that I will do it again when the chips are down.<p>I guess my point is, keep at it and remember that you're going to make something amazing. I always tell myself that I'm here to ""create epic shit"". It helps restore my ambition and makes me giggle a little. Maybe I'll have to say it more often if and when I take the startup full-time...",1281502412

1593854,comment,1593596,1593838,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yes, there are known cases. Here are a few:<p>""Some of these schemes were plausible enough, and, had they been undertaken at a time when the public mind was unexcited, might have been pursued with advantage to all concerned. But they were established merely with the view of raising the shares in the market. The projectors took the first opportunity of a rise to sell out, and next morning the scheme was at an end. Maitland, in his History of London, gravely informs us, that one of the projects which received great encouragement, was for the establishment of a company ""to make deal boards out of saw-dust."" This is no doubt intended as a joke; but there is abundance of evidence to shew that dozens of schemes, hardly a whit more reasonable, lived their little day, ruining hundreds ere they fell. One of them was for a wheel for perpetual motion—capital, one million...""<p>""But the most absurd and preposterous of all, and which shewed, more completely than any other, the utter madness of the people, was one started by an unknown adventurer, entitled 'A company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.' Were not the fact stated by scores of credible witnesses, it would be impossible to believe that any person could have been duped by such a project. The man of genius who essayed this bold and successful inroad upon public credulity, merely stated in his prospectus that the required capital was half a million, in five thousand shares of 100l. each, deposit 2l. per share. Each subscriber, paying his deposit, would be entitled to 100l. per annum per share. How this immense profit was to be obtained, he did not condescend to inform them at that time, but promised that in a month full particulars should be duly announced, and a call made for the remaining 98l. of the subscription. Next morning, at nine o'clock, this great man opened an office in Cornhill. Crowds of people beset his door, and when he shut up at three o'clock, he found that no less than one thousand shares had been subscribed for, and the deposits paid. He was thus, in five hours, the winner of 2,000l. He was philosopher enough to be contented with his venture, and set off the same evening for the Continent. He was never heard of again.""<p>This, of course, is Mackay's account of the South Sea Bubble of 1720. There are countless subsequent examples.<p>(By the way, in case it isn't obvious: I am convinced that the Diaspora guys are absolutely serious and above-board. That is why it might be amusing to pretend otherwise.<p>And I'm rooting for them too. That's why I'm engaged in the vital project of talking down expectations.

Second, the money does not matter to children; they may be better off if you have more time to spend with them.  Third, always have small contracts on the side to balance the startup losses.  Fourth, it is important that you contract to other companies, instead of being employed.  This will help with the small contracts, but also allows you to own the copyright you build for the startups; maybe not directly useful to you, but adds to your personal library and makes you more productive to your customers.<p>Good luck!",1281499999

1593787,comment,1593482,1593482,0,0,tectonic,,,"Outsourcing isn't too hard.  Just remember that you are still hiring someone, so you should take the time to actually interview a number of candidates and find a good fit.  I recommend oDesk, but have had decent experiences with eLance as well.  Many offers on these sites will come from outsourcing companies in India, the Philippines, and China.  I'm sure that some of these companies do good work, and they do offer the advantage of having people in-house with many skill sets; however, I try to hire people who are independent consultants because I prefer to develop a personal relationship with the contractor.<p>I recommend interviewing over AIM or Google Chat and having candidates answer some questions or send you written work to help evaluate how well they know English.   For example, I interviewed 8-10 people before I found my current assistant.  I had them each write an example document, and I also told each of them what kind of affiliate links are appropriate for Freebie Finder (one of my websites - <a href=""http://absurdlycool.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://absurdlycool.com</a>), then had them each pick the best affiliate link from an example set of links.  This tested their comprehension and ability to learn from example, and I found it to be a revealing metric.  I narrowed my candidates down from about 10 to a couple of candidates then chose my current assistant, who lives in the Philippines and speaks English very well.  She has done excellent work and I gave her a raise at Christmas from about $3 to $4 per hour (25% raise over her bid hourly rate), and I am going to be giving her another raise soon.  I've had outsourcers disappear on me more than once in the past, so I try hard to treat them well and to have backup plans.  For the current assistant, I took the time to write detailed and reusable google docs about her responsibilities, so that the next training should hopefully be easier.  But so far she's been great!  (I am conflicted about globalization and outsourcing, but I think that if I pay more than someone bids, and treat them well, I can't really be causing harm.)<p>A few other thoughts:<p>* You usually get what you pay for, but I've gotten good assistant work for $4 an hour and a pretty solid web design for $75 total.  It can be hit or miss, but once you form relationships they can be very valuable.  You can probably get good copy editing and preliminary research for $7-$10 an hour.  For more skilled labor, you will likely need to pay more, or do a more extensive interview search.<p>* Be clear about what you need and spend the time to train contractors.<p>* Get them to recite back to you what they will do in order to check their understanding.  It can be hard to get people to admit that they don't understand you, so tease it out, at least until you get to know them.<p>You should post a couple of job positions on odesk and interview and give it a try!

You really can't blame them for not wanting to play that game. Time and again other industries have shown that they will all lose. The exclusive phones and two year contracts are what's keeping their industry at a reasonable profit margin.<p>If I were running Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, etc, I probably would be pro net neutrality, as a lot of the consumers of wireless data will care about it and it will be a valuable feature, but I wouldn't be in a hurry to compete only on price and coverage either.

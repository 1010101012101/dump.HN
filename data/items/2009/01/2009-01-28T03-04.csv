I asked the same question here that I am asking internally.  I am genuinely interested in the sentiment of non-MSFT stack users about the MSFT stack.

453285,comment,452341,452747,0,0,arakyd,,,"Perfectionists can apply higher standards than mathematicians - mathematics does not require anything like perfection. A mathematician sets the level of rigor he needs to prove an interesting theorem. A perfectionist mathematician would never prove anything, because he would never be able to convince himself that he had the right axioms. The same thing goes for engineers - a perfectionist would never finish the blueprints for the rocket. It doesn't take a perfectionist to catch a floating point error, it just takes experience, good people, and due diligence. That's hard, but it ain't even close to perfection.",1233115092

That's not even possible without somehow limiting those interactions (""thy languages shalt have lexical binding that works thusly""), and now you're just making another meta-language like Lisp, which, presumably, doesn't fit the bill. <i>Either</i> you cut off the diversity of the language <i>or</i> you get the sort of evil interactions the likes of which have never been seen in a real language. The only middle ground there is to do both at once.<p>If your paradigm requires a genius to use it, that's not a fair comparison against other paradigms; start a genius out on OO and they can get pretty far there, too.",1233114320

You'll have to tough it out for a few years.<p>The same situation lies with your start-up. You've already let out your idea, therefore you must invest a large amount of time and effort (money) to release before any competition gets there first. At that point, what are the odds of your success?<p>To be really cautious, I would personally go with the PhD and tough it out. If you're confident enough in your talent, you can develop for your start-up on the side.

453258,comment,452946,452946,0,0,jerf,,,"When I first saw the title, the lie that lept to mind was: ""People want to stream."" They don't. Streaming sucks and is a hack around content producers pathological belief that streams are somehow safer than normal downloads because they can't be captured. Or something. (It doesn't make any sense when you get down to it.)<p>They do in some cases want their video ""now"" (not in all cases), but they'd be just as happy if the ""stream"" stuck around in some form for a while rather than evaporating immediately.<p>Of course, I read the article, and at first it seems I was wrong. But... if you dig deeper, there's still an interesting aspect to my initial reaction. Delivering live streams to 10,000 users? Yeah, you're in for a world of hurt. But one hour of 1mbps video as a simple file is ~450 megabytes of data, and delivering that to 10,000 people an hour average is more feasible; there's more tricks you can play if you're just distributing a file and not a <i>stream</i>, not the least of which is torrenting. Some people might not get it in an hour, but it's a lesser problem to come close to an hour download time than to get everything necessary for the stream to work.<p>If you're not trying to <i>stream</i>, the problem is significantly reduced back to something manageable.<p>Whether this actually helps, I don't know exactly. But I certainly don't think it's as dire.<p>Interestingly, I observe that the big video sites seem to not stream anymore, they all let loading run ahead if possible. Maybe this is the reason?",1233113513
453257,comment,452341,452834,0,0,arakyd,,,"Sounds like your attitude is pretty healthy.<p>As a perfectionist myself, let me say that the key is being able to continue working on v1 <i>even when you anticipate the potential for a problem with the finished v1</i>. The perfectionist failure mode is to restart the iteration every single time a potential problem is perceived. The perfectionist cannot stand the idea that anything, even v1, might fail in a way that was remotely preventable. The perfectionist iterates, but the iteration is a very tight loop that is not large enough to collect good feedback. In pathological cases the iteration never leaves the mind.<p>The obvious problem is that these ""mistakes"" are far too small to learn anything useful from. It does no good to tell the perfectionist that they have to iterate and learn from failure, because that is exactly what the perfectionist is doing. The problem is that it is more complicated than that - one also has to have the right kind of failures. A person with a healthy attitude towards failure won't even think about it and will naturally tend to let the problem dictate the optimal size of the iteration loop, but the perfectionist will usually always keep their loop too tight to be efficient, or to get anything useful done at all.<p>Being able to let go of that requires the ability to ignore or accept a certain kind of imperfection. Perfection in the limit requires the acceptance and embrace of <i>permanent</i> lack of perfection <i>everywhere</i> else, but especially in the builder. That is what is so hard for the perfectionist to do.",1233113474

Downloaders convert to purchases fairly infrequently -- the number most people give is 1% but what they really mean is ""we don't know a number but it is low"".<p>The traditional model largely sees the non-converters as a) not differentiated from purchasers except by their decision not to purchase and b) a cost-center: they tie you up with support inquiries and cost bandwidth, but you don't make anything off of them.<p>But what if you knew, a-priori, something about your market such that you could predict who the purchasers would be?  The traditional shareware model might say ""Great, avoid exposing yourself to the rest and you'll save time and money"".  But rather than excluding them, you could instead use them -- they've got blogs, they've got contacts in your group of core purchasers, etc.  Instead of thinking of them as a cost, you can think of them as customers who are bartering things of value instead of money for your software/service/etc.<p>One example of a business which does this pretty well is github: they use free-for-OSS pricing to get them exposed to people who will request their boss to purchase paid-for-commercial services.<p>You can use the same basic concept with free trials, free plans, free content, etc.  Its the basic core insight that I use to organize my content publication and limited free trial strategies for my downloadable software.  Still working on my blog article about that that I mentioned here earlier.  The ROI is wonderful if you get it right (remember, the traditional shareware model is assumed to leak 98%+ of prospects as muda [1], so capturing any fraction of that is powerful stuff).<p>[1] Muda is a Japanese word you'll hear a lot in certain management circles because Toyota is institutionally obsessed with eliminating it.  The closest literal translation is ""waste"", but it relates to all sorts of process inefficiency.  I find it is a helpful frame of mind to have in the toolbox when optimizing for conversions -- it sometimes is worthwhile to say not ""Why did Bob buy this?"" but ""What <i>prevented</i> Suzy from buying this?""",1233111926

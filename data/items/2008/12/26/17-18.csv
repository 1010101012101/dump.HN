Compromises should happen in implementation, when things need to be replaced or removed to meet engineering issues or deadlines. Why would you compromise when you are in the envisioning stage.<p>3) private/public transport - why not keep private transport but improve the efficiencies and footprint and improve public transport.

Because it could be a big time-suck.<p>It is not possible to have a good or meaningful relationship with everyone, especially if you have a busy life already (non-computer friends, family, work etc.).  So we discriminate.  Not in the surface-sense, but the more you get to know someone you discriminate on future potential from the relationship.<p>In the context of hacking on things together or shooting the shit about computer etc: some people are not in the same place at all.<p>After talking with someone (sometimes, even for a minute or two) you could determine that they a) don't know crap about computers, b) seem to be good company, or c) are way more experienced than you.<p>B and C are cool, but in this context I'd really worry about meeting a lot of people that don't program for a living, etc.  It's all a question of balance, I don't mind ""teaching"" someone something at all, but I can't move forward if that is going to take up my whole day (unless I am trying to move forward as a teacher which I am not).<p>I meet ""computer people"" at coffeeshops all the time (for three years I worked full time as a coffeeshop-inhabitating programmer).  I always tended to like the people fine enough socially etc. in our ""half-relationships"", and even made a friend.<p>But by far the majority of the computer conversations were not anything interesting to me because I was ""beyond"" that level.  Hmm, ""beyond""... I am trying really hard to not make this about any kind of hierarchy -- I fully appreciate that there is a rich world of ideas and concepts out there that I am a beginner in.  But if someone's asking you how to do something that is answerable in a ""I'm feeling lucky"" google query... I tend to not try to go out of my way to be have lasting ""computer relationships"" with them.<p>Online mechanisms allow you to have some control over who you spend time talking with and it's much easier to arrive at a good balance.<p>I'm very interested in opposing opinions (especially from people with busy lives).",1230314144

410299,comment,410224,410224,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I think that making clones is a great idea.  My current project is making a reddit clone on top of Django.  I'm planning on setting up social news sites focused on niche markets.<p>I know that there's already sub-reddits, Digg, etc.. but I'm pretty convinced that your average person in Peoria/Des Moines/Kansas City isn't going to get past the first page of reddit or Digg without running away screaming because of the trolls.<p>Think about it this way.  How many web forums are out there that are devoted to niche markets?  How many magazines are there?  How many local newspapers are there?  How many sitcoms are there?  How many movies are there?  The web is media.<p>There's nothing wrong with taking a format or platform, and targeting it at a niche market.  You don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you make a consumer facing web application.<p>The problem of ""What do people want"" has already been solved repeatedly.  As long as you're not infringing on IP, if you can take an idea and focus it on a specific market, you're one step closer to making money.",1230313801

410296,comment,410224,410281,0,0,eugenejen,,,"It depends.<p>In early 1980, all Apple IIe in Taiwan were made by clone manufacturers. There was a market, but Apple's price was too high by living standard then. Most of the clone manufacturers just copied the Apple IIe. But some of the clone manufacturers started to experiment with new features and improvements, and learned the experience of making computers. They later cloned IBM PC, Compaq and continued the process for each generation. Some failed but some survived and became stronger.<p>Many years later, they are so much better in cost and design of the system and take over the business from large manufacturers in U.S. and lower the price of PC to today's level. Ain't that a good thing to enable us to own cheap computers? While Apple, HP all outsource their manufacture to them.<p>Meanwhile, some of them start to improve the design and create their own product line, and finally they reach the level with confidence to introduce their own new designs and innovations.<p>Acer was one of this cloner. ASUS's founder was part of Acer team. And you can see how far they have progressed.<p>But they all started because they want to make something that people want, even just clone it.",1230313551

And Horace Mann noted BEFORE he started campaigning for compulsory school attendance in Massachusetts that by his estimate most inhabitants of Massachusetts were literate in English. (He wrote articles in the journal he founded, the Common School Journal, which I have looked up, saying that.)

In general they are mixing a different language syntax in for attributes of methods (or even more ridiculously, classes). I suppose that adding attributes to methods was a missing feature, but I see no reason not to solve it by mixing another syntax into a language.

Surely a lesson from the fall of Communism is that private property matters to the efficient functioning of an economy; and the value of most private property to most people is in their ability to transmit it to their heirs.<p>Obviously there is a need for balance here.  Too much inheritance and society loses all cohesion; too little, and society loses forward motion.  (I'm deliberately ignoring any moral question about whether inheritance is unjust; this is purely about the pragmatic question of what creates the most wealth for the most people.)<p>At a macro level, of course, we want the best person for the job.  The best line in The Communist Manifesto, actually, is (this quote may not be precise) ""to each according to his needs; from each according to his abilities.""

The community gets confused and communication breaks.""<p>The community gets confused? Give us more credit than that. We're not helpless babes in the woods. We're faced with making implementation decisions every day. Which language? Which database? Which framework? Which http server? Which hosting provider? Which linux distro? And, soon, which Ruby VM to use? And you know what? Somehow... somehow, we get by. We evaluate our choices (being glad that there are choices), and we make decisions. Can anyone out there honestly tell me that they wish there were no choices to make? Granted, too many choices can be a bad thing, but that's not what we're talking about here.<p>Perhaps the whole merging thing isn't a bad idea in some respects, but p-l-e-a-s-e stop trying to convince people that competition is bad. If you really believe that, then start a lobbying group to get nginx, apache, and lighttpd to merge. And let's not stop there, let's eliminate all duplication of effort -- at the operating system, database, programming language, and application levels. If you're going to make that argument, then take it to its logical conclusion.<p>The one solid argument made in the article is the point about having a bigger core team -- that's always a good thing -- especially at a time when we're just barely dipping our toes in the water of what is sure to be an ocean of economic upheaval.<p>One question I have: will Rails 3.0 break existing Rails app <i>and</i> break existing Merb apps? If so, then there's room for a new player to come along. Web-based frameworks are in their infancy and modularity isn't the end-all-and-beat-all.  Something new and different will emerge. At it will be a compelling alternative to Rails 4. And that will be a good thing. Until, of course, the Rails team convinces that small group of radicals that choice isn't what people want. And when that happens, you can expect me back here, like a broken record, making the same arguments.  :-)",1230311432

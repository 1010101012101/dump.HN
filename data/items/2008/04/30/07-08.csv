Banner ads catch people who may be idly clicking through gaming sites and are just as happy to click on my banner ad as any other link.  And that click and subsequent download are so easy compared to what would have to happen with a print ad, I find it really hard to believe that print ads would have a better ROI, at least with the budget I'm spending at which is about $4k per month.",1209542096

177355,comment,176456,176641,0,0,cperciva,,,"Have you considered drafting some YC alumni into helping you do interviews?  I'm imagining a system where applicants would have several interviews with YC alumni and then you'd interview the groups which get the most ""yes"" votes from your alumni screeners -- I'm guessing that after going through the YC program people get reasonably good at identifying what it takes to be a successful YC participant.<p>Of course, this would depend on the availability of YC alumni.  I know I'd sign up to do it -- if I were a YC alumnus, that is -- but the fact that I spend several hours per week acting as an alumni representative on my alma mater's university senate (and committees thereof) marks me as being unusually prone to volunteer for such things.",1209541595

177346,comment,177038,177334,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I bought a cheapo Samsung laser for my dad about five years ago for Christmas soon after I made the switch from inkjet to laser (I was feeling the excitement of a new convert), and I've bought him a new toner cartridge for it every couple of years since then.  So far, they have not discontinued the printer or the toner and it has continued to serve him well.  The model is still available from several sources (maybe an updated version, I dunno), and the toner is still widely available, though the price has gone up $10 from $70 to $80 for the 6000 page rated version.  I guess that means I can recommend cheap Samsung laser printers.<p>A year or two later, I bought my mom a pretty high end standalone inkjet photo printer, the kind that requires no computer to operate--just hook up the camera and press the print button.  I bought it because she never used the digital camera I'd given her the year before (without the printed photos it just wasn't a camera, as far as she was concerned).  I don't think that photo printer works any more (last time I saw her taking photos she was back to the film camera).  I suspect she used it a half dozen times, whenever my 4 year old nephew was around to work it for her.  Obviously, that did nothing to instill me with new confidence in modern inkjet technology.",1209539416

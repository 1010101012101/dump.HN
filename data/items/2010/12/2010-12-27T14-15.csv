You won't see that in modern cell phone batteries; as far as I know they all use lithium ion batteries.<p>On the other hand, the Apple batteries have circuitry that gives charge information. Supposedly, a complete charge cycle refines its estimates. I couldn't find a mention of this in the online iPhone user manual [1], so I'm not sure how true this is.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_effect</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/iphone_user_guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/iphone_user_guide.pdf</a>",1293461984

His life's ambition is to be CEO of Apple someday. Steve Jobs and Bertrand Serlet are his idols. Can anyone else imagine that now-a-days instead of sports heros kids have entrepreneurs as idols? I am stoked.<p>They also say the best way to learn something new is to do a personal project of interest.<p>To this effect I spent the last few weekends putting together a new Apple Fan website. There is a lot more to come! Videos, Pictures and so much more. We have about 60gb of raw content to get up to the site.<p>Currently there are a number of videos broken into categories.<p>Some things I learned so far:
- HTML5 video element is very cool.
- Browsers handle video differently.
- Video encoding is a very deep and involved topic to learn.
- There is a new WebM format I need to work with.<p>Some Items I am researching to learn:
- Ngix vs Apache
- CouchDB vs MySQL
- Moving to Ruby on Rails.
- Google Page Speed
- memcachd<p>I would love feedback so I can learn and enhance.<p>The website is at: http://6colors.net",1293461883

<a href=""http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/w32stuxnet-dossier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/w32stuxnet-dossier</a><p>The virus was first identified in late 2008, and was in the wild, in various forms until June 2010 when it was identified and advertised to the world. Let's assume it went 2 years from release to June. That's a relatively long time, even if half of that was reconnaissance.<p>To quote the Symantec document:
""Thus, the targeted system is using Profibus to communicate with at least 33 frequency converter drives from one or both of the two manufacturers, where sequence A is chosen if more Vacon devices are present and sequence B is chosen if more Fararo Paya devices are present.""<p>The upshot (to my understanding) is that only one type of frequency converter drive can be targeted per bus. If the buses are mixed, e.g. 50/50, only half the drives on that bus will be targeted.<p>Additionally, if the bus has less than 31 devices on it, then it is not targeted. We can assume that at least a few of these buses were not hooked up to a full compliment of converter drivers.",1293461480

While we all would like to believe that every deserving idea gets peer review, in practice, most people don't have the time to bother with a submitted paper unless it's coming from an institution they've more or less heard of.  How could it be otherwise?  There are huge numbers of crackpots out there, and institutional affiliation is an efficient way of filtering them out.<p>My wife wants to do theoretical physics research (she's qualified: she has a doctorate in theoretical physics) but unless she's affiliated with an institution, it's unlikely she'll get anything published, or so she says.  The problem is that unless you're a rock star, affiliation with an institution entails teaching, which in turn translates into all-out effort for roughly 22 hours a day by my own observations of the past semester.  The resulting Catch-22 is that my wife can't reasonably do research at all, and that's illogical; she needs no resources but time and access to books and preprints, which she has at home.<p>So I'd like to see some research done using these new-fangled informational access tools we have now - research that is both sound and eventually makes its way into traditional peer review simply on the basis of its soundness, and not because the institutional affiliation of the researcher makes it plausible.  This is one more thing that I think the Internet can do for us, and I'd like to see it happen.<p>Of course, the romantic in me just likes the idea of the lone mad scientist in his lair discovering room-temperature superconductivity, because <i>that is the twenty-first century I signed up for</i>.

I like the phone. It is not perfect. I could probably have aimed for the iPhone, but it was at least $100 more where I live (India). Keep this price in mind, it is very important.<p>What is the cheapest iPhone you can get today, without a contract? Most of us India buy the phones pretty much at the full price. Even if I assume that the iPhone will be priced at half of what it costs here, it would still be more expensive than some of the Android phones made by the local manufacturers here. I don't ever see Apple doing an iPhone Starter Edition.<p>There were some 100 million-plus mobile phones that were sold in India in 2009. I am sure that 99% of those were not either a Samsung Galaxy S or an iPhone. Between iOS and Android, the odds are much better on Android to tap into those potential 99 million sales.<p>This is the reason why Android will grow even stronger next year. But it won't be at the cost of the iPhone.",1293458414

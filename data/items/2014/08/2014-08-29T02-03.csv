8240940,comment,8236554,8239956,1,0,D_Alex,,,"A strong negative correlation does not support the claim that intelligence is modular (which I interpret as &quot;made up of somewhat independent modules&quot;), it would in fact support the claim that a common factor is responsible for high performance in one area and low performance in another.<p>We do know that the brain itself is quite modular, with various areas of the brain having specific functions. I had a rather disturbing experience that vividly illustrated just how specialised the function of different brain region is. It statrted with a short episode of hemianopia, which was a really bizzare experience in itself - I lost the ability to see the right half of my normal vision. In both eyes. Then, after normal vision returned, I noticed that when looking at text I could make out individual letters, I could see the words as a collection of letters, but I could not put the letters together and understand any of the words.<p>I had a pile of tests afterwards, including a brain CAT scan, that fortunately found nothing terribly wrong, and the episode was diagnosed as a vascular spasm. But apparently the brief interruption of blood flow to some particular region of the brain had interfered with the &quot;module&quot; that made words out of letters, while leaving other brain functions unaffected.<p>I have since then formed a belief that our minds are assembled from numerous modules, rather than being a monolithic whole.",1409281173

I&#x27;m in no position to store the raw text. That would require over a hundred times more storage, probably closer to a thousand times the storage costs, making it fiscally untenable for me to even build the database let alone a product with it.

Yes, there&#x27;s LTO, but to do it effectively relies on storing source code or information derived from it in the intermediate object files. Without the source, the best you can do is <i>try</i> to inline what is hopefully a reasonably well-behaved hunk of object code without any of the high-level information associated with it that the compiler threw away when it emitted it.<p>>C++ has many faults, but overhead with the C FFI is not one of them [...]<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what you mean, but if you&#x27;re talking about the runtime overhead of calling an extern C function, then that is very much a fault. Inlining can make all the difference in the world with respect to performance in an inner loop, the classic example being qsort and std::sort, and to take advantage of that, source-level compatibility <i>is</i> needed.<p>Now, if you said that source-level compatibility were better achieved using a fully-fledged FFI than by stuffing all but the worst (well, <i>some</i> of the worst) of C into your language, I would whole-heartedly agree with you. If C++ had done the former, it would be a much cleaner, much less popular language, and instead of using a warty language with templates, useful user-defined datatypes, and function overloading, we&#x27;d all be using a warty language without templates, useful user-defined datatypes, or function overloading.

Consumers actually do say they want privacy and security all the time. It&#x27;s (some) folks in our industry who think they really don&#x27;t. Or think that &quot;privacy&quot; or &quot;security&quot; in the abstract are pretty meaningless terms.<p>I fall in that latter category. Consumers say they want &quot;privacy,&quot; but what they <i>really</i> want is something that addresses a particular threat model at minimum cost. Take Snapchat for instance. For its target demographic of teenagers, the primary threats are parents. Snapchat won&#x27;t protect you from a technologically savvy opponent, but for most of its users, that&#x27;s fine. Snapchat COULD build in two-factor auth, end-to-end encryption, and a whole slew of other privacy measures, but if it makes the app slower and harder to use, it&#x27;s probably not a good value proposition given what Snapchat knows about its users.<p>Now, what I think what you&#x27;re implying is that Snapchat should do more, regardless of what its users care about. Although Snapchat&#x27;s users might not care about the security of their pictures outside of their parents, there are larger &quot;political, historical, and social issues&quot; surrounding the fact that a single entity has access to so many of those pictures in the first place. That well be so. You could argue that Snapchat should take greater care of those photos in order to be a good citizen of the world. But that&#x27;s a different argument than &quot;there&#x27;s a growing market for privacy&quot;.",1409278619

Have you never heard C described as being portable assembly language?<p>Unless you are writing low-level, performance-sensitive code for something like an operating system or device driver, usually details like endianness matter only to the extent that they specify external protocols and file formats. I would argue that this sort of detail is normally best encoded/decoded explicitly at the outer layers of an application anyway.<p>Obviously if you rely on primitive types like int or long in C or C++ having a specific size or endianness, or if you assume that they will be equivalent to some specific external format, you’re probably going to have problems porting your code (and any package containing it) across some platforms.<p>However, that issue does not contradict what I proposed. It’s perfectly viable — indeed, it’s inevitable — to have packages that are only available on some platforms, or packages which depend on different things across platforms. That’s fine, as long as your packaging system doesn’t assume by default that the same thing works everywhere.<p><i>And no, it isn&#x27;t code publishers that spend thousands of hours resolving broken and incompatible builds, it&#x27;s release maintainers.</i><p>Who is the “release maintainer” who made those jQuery libraries I mentioned in my extended example above play nicely together?<p>Again, this issue does not contradict what I proposed anyway.

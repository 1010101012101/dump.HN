But if previously the driver made $100 a day and paid $50 for the lease, then after the fare increase he'll make $120 a day (assuming demand doesn't fall) and pay $60 for the lease. So his profit goes from $50 to $60.",1339297095

4090003,comment,4088941,4088941,1,0,ajays,,,"I have always wondered about this. In San Francisco (aka ""The City""), a driver typically pays $200+ for a 12-hour shift on weekends. Then they go around in a mad dash, trying to pick up as many lucrative passengers as possible; sometimes resulting in deaths[1]<p>There are 2 rent-seekers in this system. One is the City, which uses these taxis as a revenue stream. Why? We are all paying taxes anyways; why should we pay the City for the privilege to ride a car? And then there's the medallion owners. In the old days, the politically connected got these medallions for peanuts, and are just sitting on them, collecting rent (corruption, anyone?). And surrounding this system is a parasitic bureaucracy for ""managing"" everything: medallion rentals, credit card transactions, etc. (and we, the taxpayers, pay for this bureaucracy again).<p>A better solution, IMHO, is the following. Auction off 20% of the medallions every year, using a Dutch Auction. The participants in the auction must be licensed drivers with N years of experience, and must pass a test about familiarity with the City. A driver can get only 1 medallion. The City, as a favor to drivers, can bring banks to the table, who can finance drivers.  Each medallion is for 5 years; after that period, the medallion goes up for auction again.<p>[1] There was a case recently where the driver was headed to the airport with passengers. He was speeding so he could get back there as quickly as possible (there's a weird rule that if a cab leaves the airport but comes back within 30(?) minutes, it can come back to the front of the line). He had a mechanical malfunction, and the cab caught fire. He survived, but his 2 passengers burnt to death.\n<a href=""http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/san_francisco&id=7497183"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/san_fran...</a>",1339296054

However I would add one huge caveat.<p>The power of vast, organic, ecological systems like markets and large open source communities, is that we can work on all problems simultaneously.  This is immensely powerful and it also allows network effects of problem solving, such as those side effects mentioned in the article.  If nobody was working on the things that required big parallel clusters, then the advancements in GPU technologies would matter not a bit to solving these problems.<p>I don't think we need to worry about how important the problems we are trying to solve are.

4089961,comment,4088941,4088941,11,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is reminiscent of New York's abominably badly-structured rent control system, which costs the vast majority of New Yorkers an immense amount in increased rent, and will probably never go away because there's a powerful asshole lobby that works overtime to keep it in place.<p>The <i>idea</i> of rent control isn't so bad. If done properly and fairly, it could make New York a lot better, but the insane legacy system is an unmitigated disaster. Since RC rents aren't even allowed to go up with inflation, there are a lot of people paying ~$200 for apartments that would rent for 10-15 times that. Technically, RC can only be passed within families, but the rules are broken all the time, and there's a common (if morbid) practice whereby people seeking rent control stalk obituaries and try to get themselves named as relatives of the deceased, usually in an arrangement involving paying ""key money"" to non-NYC resident legitimate relatives of this person. It has created a class of parasitic, law-breaking New Yorkers who will never leave, because they're locked in to an arrangement strictly better than ownership (landlord pays maintenance costs and taxes, which are higher than RC rent) and even if they only visit the city for 4 weeks out of the year, holding on to their RC apartment is cheaper than a hotel-- especially because they can sublet their RC apartments at market rent, which is also illegal but happens all the time.<p>Now, here's the kicker. The system was developed in 1947 to benefit working-class people. In 2012, almost all of the rent-control holders are upper-middle to upper-class people who have no legitimate claim to needing it. Unfortunately, they're well-connected to the city council and therefore, like cockroaches, will never leave. Disgusting.",1339294322

The second half is complaining about FAA regulations of avionics, which annoys me.<p>About a decade ago, I remember reading a fiction book about a pilot, who, among other things was unhappy that TCAS (radar system on a plane to keep it from flying into other planes) didn't communicate with the GPWS (radar system on a plane to keep it from flying into the ground) when telling the pilot how to avoid a mid-air collision.<p>The consequence is that TCAS could possibly tell a pilot to run right into a mountain, while trying to not run into another plane. This is, of course, bad.<p>The book harped on this at great length, and one of the many bad things it had to say about the FAA is that suffocatingly heavy regulation prevented manufacturers from making changes that could save lives.<p>I finish the book, all fired up, get on the internet, and discover that, hey, TCAS II does exactly what it should, and doesn't tell the pilot to fly into the ground. The problem was fixed, by the FAA, without needing to <i>abolish</i> the FAA. There was never any controlled flight into terrain crashes as a result of bad TCAS directives. I got needlessly angry for no reason at all.",1339293891

Otherwise the user (or malware) can upload or download anything and all you see at the network level is a destination IP address.  If a user has admin rights (which is common in corporate environments) then they can install software which can mimic a browser using HTTPS.<p>At the network level it is difficult to identify what program generated a request and which user was running that program.  I am very sceptical of the heuristic approaches that try and solve this problem (Palo Alto App-ID for example) that display quite shocking emergent properties.<p>Surely it is technically preferable to track network requests within the OS and browser where you can actually get at information reliably without any hocus pocus.  If a user can avoid it by just &quot;shutting it down&quot; then they can also remove the AV, connect to a proxy and spend the afternoon uploading client lists to a porn site.",1424379572

Men with low sperm counts, men that discover they have a womb in their late seventies after fathering several children and even intersex people who had an operation a very long time ago are probably happier being bracketed as &quot;men&quot; than &quot;somewhere fairly close to male on the gender spectrum&quot;, and the same goes for the women not wanting to be considered &quot;further away from female on the gender spectrum&quot; than their sisters because of polycystic ovaries. From this perspective we don&#x27;t want to redefine gender as a spectrum so much as to accept that our definitions of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; need to be sufficiently broad to encompass small quantities of genetic material transferred across umbilical cords and even the odd phenotypical abnormality.<p>Frankly, arguments against the gender binary are much better rooted in cultural phenomenon like South East Asian <i>Katoeeys</i> and Samoan <i>Fa&#x27;afafine</i> who openly define themselves as a third gender rather than medical abnormalities which for the most part people prefer to overlook or even medically &quot;correct&quot; to align themselves with a binary gender identity they feel mentally comfortable with.",1424379559
9077005,comment,9076351,9076351,0,0,anologwintermut,,,"Personally, the biggest take away to this is the invasive targeting of completely innocent and ordinary people simply as a means to get access to things the NSA needed (sim Card keys).   We have concrete evidence  they nailed peoples personal email accounts and social networks merely as a means to an get crypto keys in mass. Sure, the potential mass surveillance is exceedingly problematic, but thats mainly problematic because of the potential for abuse. Abuse that we either assumed would happen or already had, but as far as I know there was little direct evidence of.<p>The absolute lowest bar for surveillance seems to be that a government doesn&#x27;t use it to intentionally target innocent people/ those not in the game (hell, lets lower it even further to be only people the government themselves believe are innocent).[0]<p>That potentially allows dragnet collection of data if no one looks at it. It might allow hacking just a company&#x27;s servers  to get access to third party data. It probably allows you to spy on foreign heads of state (even if it&#x27;s a boneheaded move).  But it damn well doesn&#x27;t allow you to go through the personal communications of people who you know have done nothing wrong and aren&#x27;t even working for someone who has.<p>[0] This is precisely the woefully low bar Obama has been espousing :  “The bottom line is that people around the world, regardless of their nationality, should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don’t threaten our national security and that we take their privacy concerns into account in our policies and procedures,”",1424379556

That number is difficult to come up with: it would have to look at impact analysis to see whether programs can effectively help people. And as technology, social programs, and medicine become better, the margin of error would likely go down. I can&#x27;t come up with that number exactly, but given that we&#x27;ve seen significant benefits from social programs for atypically sexed people in the last few decades, I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that we can still provide more benefit.",1424379491

9076975,comment,9075659,9076853,0,0,threatofrain,,,"Actually, there is a way to decide if something is scientifically better. All you have to show is that your construct is competitive within the ecosystem of constructs. You can weakly improve upon an existing model by adding tons of domain-specific complications, which is what should&#x27;ve happened. But instead of saying that there are two predominant sexes, along with many abnormal and discrete bins, they propose a &quot;continuum&quot;.<p>The researchers found that, in the most inclusive definitions, 1% of the population isn&#x27;t sufficiently accounted for by traditional constructs.<p>But there&#x27;s no new theory here. How do I predict complications based on what factors? What&#x27;s the new model? The &quot;spectrum&quot;? A spectrum is a scale with escalating and deescalating values as you travel up and down, where jumps in the spectrum are connected to jumps in prediction. As for abnormal and discrete bins, well, the scientific community already has that. What&#x27;s new to the table? A reformation of language so that we avoid the word &quot;abnormal&quot;? But where&#x27;s the improved model?<p>Also note that you propose that there&#x27;s no way to think about scientific or construct &quot;betterness&quot;. Yes there is. You can measure by complexity, prediction, explanation, or generalizability. These are just a few ways. But you waved away scientific discussion, and instead choose only to use the moral lens, and bring up sociopathy.<p>Also, the reason I am talking about human limitations in processing large numbers is because I am accusing the opposition of abuse. I am not saying you should believe me because of X, I&#x27;m saying beware of opposition arguments because they are abusive to human minds.<p>And on the matter of using percentages to interpret numbers, I return to my example of state budgets, because that is a place where politicians often abuse psychology by stating what appears to be extravagant numbers. By extending your statements, I might say that not only is $70B a lot of money, but so is $7B. But then what if you told me that $70B is less than 1% of the state budget?

9076970,comment,9075945,9076498,0,0,venaoy,,,"The world&#x27;s simplest reasons why you might pay something using bitcoins is simply when this is the only way, or cheapest way, or safest way to make a transaction.<p>Example #1: some merchants are hit really hard with fraud, such as intangible goods paid by international credit card transactions. So hard that they decided to stop selling internationally. These merchants discover that Bitcoin re-enables them to sell internationally because Bitcoin completely solves the fraud problem for them (since transactions are irreversible). In that case, as an international customer of such a merchant, paying in Bitcoin is your only option.<p>Example #2: some merchants offer discounts when paying in Bitcoin (because they don&#x27;t incur credit card fees). So it is in your interest to pay in Bitcoin: you don&#x27;t have to pay the fees from exchanging coins for fiat, and you don&#x27;t have to pay the indirect credit card fees that the merchant would make you cover (via the absence of a discount).<p>Example #3: as Bicoin&#x27;s adoption grows, more and more people end up having bitcoins in their hands, like your nephew giving you $50 worth of coins for Christmas. What&#x27;s the easiest for you to use them? Setting up an account at an exchange (and incurring the associated hassles and fees when selling), or just spending them directly? Of course in this case you would want to spend them directly.<p>Example #4: say you are travelling out of town and paying for a meal in a restaurant that you suspect might be skimming credit cards... do you pay using a credit card or bitcoins? Using Bitcoin here would be much safer. It has all the advantages of credit cards (and more) without the inconvenience and danger of handling cash (losing it, getting robbed, no ability to &quot;back up&quot; cash, etc). Hardware bitcoin wallets have especially an insane opportunity to innovate in this space (wrt. security and ease of use).",1424379263

As an example, I think very few people would argue about the plausible deniability of a person found with a dead body in their trunk and yet there are cases arguing about whether or not similar &#x27;evidence&#x27; should be considered if it was discovered due to a traffic stop without cause or an improperly served search warrant, etc. The reason is not because constitutional rights advocates want the possibly guilty to go free and not because we don&#x27;t want law enforcement to be able to do their jobs, but because we don&#x27;t want abuses to become the norm rather than the exception.<p>If the courts decide that the DNA of an individual can be tested without a warrant or even probable cause, then they could just begin testing everyone that had even passing contact with a victim, a neighborhood street, a school, an entire city.<p>At the most extreme, the FBI could then begin to secretly collect our DNA when we go to any federal office and eventually have an entire database they can search for a match to any random DNA found at a crime scene. You might try to compare this to fingerprint databases, but those are databases of people where they was legal cause to require collection of their prints--convicted criminals and law enforcement officials are two examples. And remember that neither fingerprints nor DNA are definitive; labs make mistakes, samples are mishandled, etc.<p>If there was no fear that evidence could be thrown out because of how it was collected, then law enforcement would just proceed unhindered in any investigation and worry about consequences later when they got their arrest.",1424379177

And since there is little regulation around this right now, they are free to be creative in assembling them.  For example you can get a good DNA sample from the straw used to blow into a breathalyzer.  So get stopped at a routine traffic stop, your name, license plate, and DNA can go into a database.  And voila, police can now match you and your relatives against crime scenes!<p>Think this is crazy?  This has already been happening.  See <a href=""https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/aug/15/maryland-court-of-appeals-upholds-breathalyzer-dna-seizure/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/aug/15/maryland-co...</a> for breathalyzer DNA being used to convict of a crime, <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/26/justice/supreme-court-dna/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/26/justice/supreme-court-dna/</a> for the Supreme Court OKing DNA tests for arrests without a conviction, and <a href=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/North-Texas-Drivers-Stopped-at-Roadblock-Asked-for-Saliva-Blood-232438621.html?_osource=SocialFlowFB_DFWBrand&utm_content=buffer87aa1&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/North-Texas-Drivers-Stopped...</a> for a random example where this was done to random people at a traffic stop.  Yes, there is outrage at present.  But over time this could become the new normal.<p>As technology improves and costs come down, incentives to match everyone to DNA tests will go up, not down.  Heck, I remember as a child in Canada over 30 years ago having police come to my elementary school and taking everyone&#x27;s fingerprints.  I believe that the cause was so that if anyone went missing, they could identify us.  But once that data is collected and goes into databases, it doesn&#x27;t come out.<p>Heck, how many parents would give consent today for their 2nd graders to get a DNA test for that purpose?",1424378680

On what scientific grounds did you decide 1% was negligible?<p>The negligibility of a percentage is only choosable based on your values and how much you value what exists in that percentage. My argument is that in most contexts, you probably care about 70 million people. If that&#x27;s not the case, you may be a sociopath. But my guess is that you aren&#x27;t a sociopath--you&#x27;re just operating under some temporary delusion that because you&#x27;ve decided to say 1% of people instead of 70 million people, your decision that the group of people in question is negligible is scientific.<p>> We aren&#x27;t talking about killing 70 million people.

Why do submarines have to move quickly to enable a first strike? Can&#x27;t they just stealthily move into the exact position necessary days prior to launch? You should review what public data is available on Trident testing, because it contradicts every one of your assertions. The Trident equipment section has been observed conducting 14 distinct warhead release maneuvers in space. The largest warhead Trident can carry is estimated to have a 500kt yield. Trident is estimated to carry a max loadout to >7e3 km, and a reduced (treaty) loadout to >11e3km. It is also estimated to exhibit the precision necessary to guarantee kills against the latest Russian silos (envelop the silo structure within the earthen blast cavity). This means that the Trident fleet can strike and neutralize every counter-force target in Eurasia from defended waters.

Moreover, I&#x27;ve seen benchmarks suggesting that for some applications it&#x27;s also faster than OS X.<p>I&#x27;ve tried out different desktop environments but I&#x27;m sticking with Unity for now. It&#x27;s really simple to use and clean. I do most of my work in the terminal anyways.\nIf you guys want to make Unity look better, I suggest trying out the Numix themes and icon packs. They change Unity almost completely and make it look a lot stylish. It also works in Gnome3.<p>In what regards terminal emulators, I recommend Terminator. I use it because it allows arranging terminals in grids, which comes in handy especially at work. It is based on Gnome Terminal.",1424377312

Numbers get their significance relatively, not in themselves.<p>Relative to what? I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m having this conversation.<p>70 million people is more than the number of people killed in both world wars. 70 million people is more than the population of the UK or Canada. Are you claiming that the world wars caused negligible deaths, or that the populations of the UK or Canada are negligible?<p>You can&#x27;t just say 1% is a negligible amount without context. Whether 1% is a negligible margin of error is entirely dependent on context. 1% blood alcohol will probably kill you, 1% error on your taxes, if intentional, is enough to put you in jail, 1% error in floating point arithmetic is the difference between a missile that hits its target and a missile that lands in a civilian residence. But numbers get their significance relatively, right?<p>70 million people <i>is</i> a lot of people.",1424376058

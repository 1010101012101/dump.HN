For example, the <i>unabomber</i>&#x27;s woodsman hut style existence probably had effectively zero pollution footprint. Whereas, the also American example of a large scale industrial farmer with a four bedroom house, two cars and a family, large scale farming equipment, and expectations of 24x7x365 electricity, water, sewerage, cell phone signals, non-local products and in-school education for his children is going to be worse than an urbanite.<p>If you are ever lucky enough to get the chance visit some more traditional cultures, you can see for yourself just how slight an impact they make on their environment, with houses, food, and clothes alike built from nature.

It depends on what you&#x27;re discussing, and in what context.  Medical experiments like Tuskegee and MK Ultra, I agree with you entirely.<p>Wiretapping, it&#x27;s a little different.  I mean, non-Americans who&#x27;re being spied on the by US government should be offended, maybe, but not quite the same level of outrage.<p>It seems reasonable to demand that your own country follow its own law.  If/when they break that law, there&#x27;s an extra type of outrage that&#x27;s appropriate.  And American elected representatives purport to be agents of the citizens of the US (and they do not purport to be agents of humanity at large.. well, not as literally, anyway).  If/when they act against the interests of the US citizenry, there&#x27;s an extra type of outrage that&#x27;s appropriate.<p>Further, the harm that the NSA can do to a random citizen of, say, Germany, by spying on them, is modest.  The harm that can be done to Americans, by being spied upon by hypothetical corrupt agents of their own government, is much steeper, I think.",1371372995

While I could go invest time finding numbers, to be honest I find it a bit rich that you ask me to provide sources while making equally unreferenced, sweeping and IMHO dicier claims in response.<p>For example, claiming the carbon footprint of city dwellers is low might be possible if it doesn&#x27;t consider the cost of hauling the products they routinely use and throw away at rates far higher than other people on the planet... but that doesn&#x27;t make it a realistic or truthful stance on the matter.<p>I am not surprised that NYC is low on obvious evils when considering this form of skin-deep environmental statistic, because it produces very little of... well, anything. As the center of finance, NY derives a great amount of wealth from achieving effectively zero of utility to the rest of the world.<p>For something more concrete, let&#x27;s try measuring garbage. (I&#x27;m not going to get in to the interesting question of Wall St.&#x27;s facilitatory role in greater evils.) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues_in_New_York_City#Garbage_disposal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues_in_New_Yo...</a> <i>In September 2012, Travel+Leisure named New York City the #1 &quot;America&#x27;s Dirtiest City,&quot; from the results of a readership survey rating 35 &quot;Favorite Cities&quot; in the United States.</i> It continues: <i>In 2006 Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed legislation establishing a new solid waste management plan, which will use barges and trains to export 90% of the city’s 12,000 daily tons of residential trash</i>. I can tell you that country people don&#x27;t generate that much trash, and they can often dispose of it in a decentralized fashion (eg. via compost). Even Mexico City only produces 10,000 tons per day (random stat online), and its population is far higher and they probably <i>actually make some tangible goods</i>. But I&#x27;m not going to go build a well-referenced numerology of truth here. I hope you might be motivated to research further yourself.<p>The bottom line is that nature loves decentralization, and &#x27;taxes&#x27; centralization. Cities are unnatural conglomerations that abhor nature. While we can sustain them, it&#x27;s not the smartest thing to do in a finite world.

So you&#x27;d implement your business-logic without any knowledge of database etc (ok, you&#x27;d use some abstract interface for querying those objects).

This was essentially an FPGA implemented on an FPGA.

If you're on an instance with gigabit connectivity and you're doing 1 Gb/s of EBS I/O, other network chatter will suffer, probably fairly dramatically. That's why the high-I/O instances have 10 gigabit connectivity, as I understand it.<p>Happy to be proven wrong but this is based on a year or so of experience dealing with EBS. You can't see the EBS traffic in your tools (at least that I've been able to find), which complicates things.<p>It's all kinds of different on VPC instances, therefore I suspect the network interface model -- and possibly EBS connectivity -- is different on those.

That still leaves us with the problem of not being able to point properly.<p>I can't even imagine how the touchscreen could ever rival the precision of the mouse as a pointing device. The average adult human finger is simply too thick to select 5 characters from the middle of a word displayed in 10 points, or to drag a Photoshop layer 1 pixel to the right. Even a conventional trackpad on a cheap laptop has better precision than your finger does, though good luck finding actual graphic designers who prefer trackpads to actual mice. Styluses (styli?) aren't much better, unless your stylus is sharp enough to damage the screen. The fact that touchscreens don't allow you to fine-tune your aim before you click makes it even more difficult to achieve precision.<p>How do we address this issue? How do we make touchscreen devices useful for those who need spatial precision? What would be the most natural way to add precise pointing abilities to a tablet computer without compromising the advantages of the touchscreen? Carrying around a cordless mouse doesn't seem to be a particularly elegant solution. What do you think?

I like the fact that, for the most part, the hierarchy has little to do with actual coding competence and a lot more to do with reputation and business acumen. (I like it in the sense that I might Facebook ""Like"" an article on a natural disaster. I don't like the fact that it's true, but I like the fact that he had the insight to say it.)<p>Software <i>is</i> a pyramid, but it has a competence pyramid and a respect/autonomy pyramid, and they aren't always the same. To the extent that they line up, it has more to do with respect begetting competence (because you get better projects and learn more) than the other way around.<p>I came up with what I think is a good representation of the competence levels here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a> . The short explanation of it is:<p>0.5 - 0.9: Rising adders, or people who are learning the ropes and developing the ability to contribute, in minor ways, to software projects. However, they'll perform poorly without structure and mentorship. Most college students are in this range.<p>1.0 - 1.4: Solid adders, who reliably can create software. They can fix bugs, add features, and solve almost all technical problems, although it might take a lot of time to do it, and the solutions might not jive with the rest of the architecture. Most professional programmers are in this tier.<p>1.5 - 1.9: Rising multipliers, who make other people more productive, have architectural sense on account of experience, and usually know more than one programming language and framework (and can compare different approaches). At 1.5, we're talking about the 90th percentile of professional programmers.<p>2.0 - 2.4: Solid multipliers. Very rare: perhaps 1 to 2 percent of professional programmers. These are people you could trust, if needed, to unilaterally lay out the architecture for a technology company. (You'll want to hire specialists at some point, but a 2.0-level generalist can take you into the tens of millions of dollars in revenue.) It takes 10 to 15 years, with very little slack or redundancy in the experience, to get here. Most people never do.<p>2.5 - 3.0+: Global multipliers. Very few people can even evaluate talent at this level, which usually takes 20+ years to attain. At this level, most programmers have become expert in multiple specialties and developed, at the least, a world-class interdisciplinary knowledge (i.e. they might not be the world leader in X and Y, but there's no one out there who exceeds them on a project that involves both).<p>The success/respect hierarchy is somewhat different. I'd say it looks like this. Since business people have a huge say in where one actually lands, it diverges from the competence ladder as one goes up. The first number is where one generally <i>needs</i> to be on the 0.0-to-3.0 competence scale and the second is where one is <i>perceived</i> to be, mostly by business types.<p>Amateur (0.6 / 0.5): knows a few things about computer science, but not yet employable as a professional programmer. You might let this person transition to an engineering role over 12 months if they already work at your company in good standing.<p>Low worker (0.9 / 0.8): Can program, but with no real autonomy. Given tiny go-for projects with same-day deadlines, in addition to stuff that no one wants to do. Usually gets non-programming grunt work. It's nearly impossible to improve from this low-prole status, because you won't get decent work.<p>Mid worker (1.2 / 1.0): Average professional programmer. This is where the ""5:01 engineers"" who carry out their assigned work but don't make extra efforts to learn more will usually end up.<p>High worker (1.5 / 1.2): Above-average programmer. Usually has a title like ""Senior Software Engineer"". Capable of working with high levels of autonomy; usually trusted to work with low (but nonzero) levels. Still involves no influence over tools, product direction, or architecture. This is a frustrating level, because your actual competence is 1.5-2.0+ (top 10%) but you're still treated like a 1.3-ish Java jockey.<p>X Who Programs (?? / 1.5): Engineer who develops a credibility that is independent of software and thereby improves his software career. Data science (X = statistics) is one way to do this. Another is to become a PM, a startup founder, or a financial quant. This step has little to do with engineering <i>per se</i>. It's what you do when you realize that leveling up as an engineer isn't possible unless you get the highest quality of work, and that you need an engineering-independent credibility in order to convince bosses that you're capable of high-quality software work.<p>Manager-equivalent (?? / 2.0): To get to this level and beyond, it's no longer necessary to improve as a software engineer-- it will help, in the long run, to be competent, but it's not required-- because you can shut down people who know better than you. You don't need to be at 2.0 or higher, but executives will assume that you are. At this level, management considers you to be one of the best programmers in the company, but adopts you as ""one of us"". Your title is usually something like ""Staff Software Engineer"" or ""Principal Architect"". You've probably reached something that looks like ""Freedom Zero"": you're considered too valuable to fire, so you can work on whatever you want. However, there are still soft social pressures to suit the needs of management, and if you ignore those, while you won't be fired, you'll be out of ""the club"".<p>Executive-equivalent (?? / 2.5): Very rare. There might be five thousand 2.5+ software engineers in the world, and there are about few hundred people (with some overlap, and some discrepancy on both sides) who can reliably make themselves <i>be perceived as</i> 2.5+. Your title is now ultra-prestigious, like ""<Company> Fellow"". Millions of dollars are routinely bet on your ambitions. Your name is frequently substituted into Chuck Norris jokes. You answer directly to the CTO and have the right to direct as much of the engineering organization as you wish. It's like being the VP/Eng, but with an added benefit, which is that you have an excuse (you're still an engineer) to code if you want to.",1351772450

Currently DRM looks harmless but when you consider the long-term consequences it doesn't look good at all.<p>First we fought TCPA and Trusted Computing, now we have the first global players (Apple, Microsoft) put DRM into their gadgets to get maximum control and minimum competition. And the customers buy, consume, and play, without considering the consequences.<p>Our technology today is the foundation for the political systems of tomorrow, and when you consider the global demographic development you know what I mean. Within the next twenty years we will have a completely different global political and economical system, and I don't want to have them total control over us with their super-safe cascaded DRM chips which nobody will be able to break.<p>Unfortunately we can't stop Apple, Microsoft & Co. from using DRM. That's why I appreciate pioneer projects like this selfmade FPGA very much as they help to jump over the big hurdle from open source to true open hardware.

My reasoning is that the crux of your argument is based on the statement you just made -- ""It's as if they think their customers are dupes,"" -- and I think that's a strawman.<p>It's common knowledge that companies offer sales to move product.  It's also common knowledge that is a benefit to the companies.  My opinion is that affect does not, or should not discount the news of the sale.  It's like critiquing a television ad for being self-interested.  Of course it is, it's an advertisement, as this is.  That doesn't mean that we should dismiss it any more than we should dismiss any product that has a price attached (unless that's the point you're arguing -- I don't mean to rule out an RMS-style argument here).<p>For what it's worth, they <i>are</i> losing millions of dollars on this deal.  You're right, it's a loss-leader, but they are losing revenue by offering the sale.  That's how a sale works.  You offer a discount to get people in the door and hope that the quality of your product can sway them into becoming loyal customers.  If they are unable to convert those prospects into customers because their products aren't strong, then they will have simply lost the revenues otherwise entitled to them had they not offered this sale.<p>In summary, you took the obvious point and made it sound much more negative than it is.  On a more meta tangent, I recently posted something like ""Now that I know what a middlebrow dismissal is, I'm worried that every dismissal I make will be categorized as one."" -- I made that as a joke, but I'm honestly concerned about it and now that I'm aware of it, I believe that it is a problem on HN.  I believe there are numerous problems on HN, and through downvoting, comments and my own behavior, I would much prefer it be fixed than abandoned.  My personal fix against the middlebrow dismissal is to not be dismissive, which happens to fall under my own personal HN guideline of ""assume good faith.""<p>By 'assuming good faith' of all parties and not being dismissive without being constructive, I think we'd have a much better environment, though I do worry that it would become too 'vanilla' (as my own posts often tend to be when I reread them.)  Regardless, the easy fix for you at the moment is to just quit caring about karma altogether, and then you can probably ignore these meta-discussions outright.",1351771721

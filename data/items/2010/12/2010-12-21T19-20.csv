I'm going to assume that the existing etacts service will, in fact, be shut down, and that the team will work on implementing the same (or similar, or perhaps completely unrelated) functionality within Salesforce's products.<p>If the shutdown message made reference to the fact that they're being acquired by Salesforce, then perhaps users (who may not necessarily read their emails all that carefully) would assume that the existing service would be continuing under the Salesforce banner. Then the etacts folks would have had to spend the next <i>N</i> weeks correcting that particular misconception by answering a bunch of emails from users going ""Waaah I don't want to be in Salesforce"" or ""But I already have a Salesforce account, how do I integrate the two"" and ""wtf is Salesforce I tried to log in and it didn't work"".<p>On reflection this makes sense.",1292961577

You can start by listing the food bloggers that you like on the site (do follow) and slowly build up a relationship with them by regularly commenting on their posts.<p>Your first 1000 active users are going to be super important and will set the culture for the next 1000000 users.

2029093,comment,2027782,2028438,0,0,willchang,,,"There are two other possible explanations.<p>(1) Languages that borrow don't just borrow when they ""need"" to.  For example, most languages have perfectly good ways to communicate ""okay"", but may borrow it nonetheless.  But over time the borrowing may displace the native words or limit their applicability.  The Chinese may be anxious that sinitic words will shrink in semantic scope once widespread borrowing takes over.  This is not a disaster from a linguistic point of view, of course; it is just language change.  But those that deem foreign borrowings illegitimate out of a sense of nationalism will be left with a sense of a shrinking language.  Perhaps this is an element in the chauvinism you mentioned.<p>(2) In the long run, having a language with words of diverse etymologies makes a language harder to learn, cf. English.  I don't know if the Chinese government deserves credit for realizing this, though.",1292961360

It is kept on life support by a smallish and dwindling number of native speakers (virtually no only-Welsh speakers remain, 600,000 people identify as Welsh speakers, but the Wikipedia article suspiciously avoids mentioning how many of those consider themselves 'fluent'), and a government mandate that all official documents, announcements, roadsigns / etc. must be in Welsh as well as English, and mandatory teaching at school.<p>I was wondering recently if it would be interesting to argue that forcibly teaching children a globally useless language for the sake of pleasing the adults who arbitrarily want it saved is a weak form of child abuse. It certainly isn't a form of educating children in a way that is in their best interest at least, which I'd think is a pretty strong heuristic for a useful education system.<p>The main out against that argument is that language education in school is so ineffective and accounts for such a small amount of time that it's hardly a thing worth complaining about against the backdrop of all the other things which could be improved.",1292960648

It is crowd sourcing for recipes: http://www.fridgetofood.com<p>A couple of months ago I posted this and got great feedback.  I've been through quite a few iterations since then and have what is now a site that is minimally feature complete.  I'm beginning to work on the more advanced reputation dependent features, but have a bit of a chicken and egg problem with the community.  I have about 150 users, of whom some 20 maybe visit on a regular basis.  And a handful post recipes on a regular basis.  The site has a pretty slow velocity, because even the most dedicated users only have recipes to post a few times a month.<p>The issue I'm facing is that I'll need enough of a community to test the reputation dependent features when I implemented them.  And I don't really have that right now.  Unless I make the reputation threshold incredibly low, which beats the point.<p>So I'm facing the classic community based chicken and egg problem.  I've pretty much mined my solid connection network out.  The ones who cook regularly already use my site.  The ones who don't, well, don't.  I've been working pretty hard on Twitter and the various food-based subreddits to try and draw in some new early adopter users.  But I've experienced limited success with that.  Those who comment love it, and join.  But the slow velocity often prevents them from doing much before forgetting about it.  I've been trying to build connections with food bloggers, however, that is slow going.  I'm not naturally a marketer type, so I have to spend a great deal of effort doing that.  And it takes time away from writing code.  I've considered cold e-mailing bloggers with a basically canned e-mail, but haven't tried it much.  And when I have, I experienced pretty limited success there too.<p>So how can I solve the chicken and egg problem?  People seem to love the concept of my site, and like the implementation.  But the slow velocity and small community is preventing me from... well building a big enough community to have a higher velocity.  Also, I'm having trouble just finding ways to get the link to it out there.

2028947,story,,,2,0,DevonWarwick,"Foursquare Updates Create Competitive Advantage",http://blog.openviewpartners.com/blog/core-marketing/0/0/foursquare-updates-create-competitive-advantage,"By Corey O'Loughlin
Perhaps I'm a pessimist, but when I read headlines stating that location-based service (LBS) provider Foursquare released updates including those enabling photo uploads and comments, my reaction was as follows: <i>yawn</i>.  Why?  Because rival LBS provider Gowalla already implemented many of these features last March!<p>The Foursquare brand has become synonymous with the LBS movement, a movement that is gaining momentum as smart phones continue to dominate the mobile market. Though Gowalla doeslbs not have the same sizable user base as Foursquare, they have proven to be an innovative leader in the LBS space.<p>So, Foursquare essentially released an update to rival the capabilities of its less-popular competitor?<p>There is more to the story than that.  This release is actually a major move by Foursquare to create competitive advantage: users of Foodspotting, Instagram and other location-based applications will be able to share their photos, comments and checkins with Foursquare.  Foursquare has made it more compelling to use their applications wherever users choose to use it (not necessarily in their app).
I spoke with my good friend and LBS enthusiast Mike Schneider about the new release--it would be an understatement to say he was excited about it.<p>Mike had the following to say: ""Foursquare has been doing just fine without a photo model and that there is no reason to apologize for being late to the game.""  He thinks Foursquare's move to both take photos on their platform as well as ""suck in"" photos from others like Instagram and Foodspotting while checking you in is innovative and demonstrates their desire to rule the checkin world.<p>Previously, Foursquare did not allow people to comment when checking in. That capability was available only through other platforms like Twitter and Facebook--this shift is very exciting. Mike said ""While no LBS is particularly good at summarizing comments and mentions related to content, Foursquare is allowing you to have them pushed to your phone as they happen"".""<p>Mike continued: ""The updated features make it easier and more compelling to use Foursquare than ever and are in line with their desire to have brands use the API to take advantage of their platform without them necessarily needing to be involved.""<p>Things aren't always what they seem on the surface--these updates are a great move for Foursquare as they continue to expand the LBS space.  Scaling a business like Foursquare while under public scrutiny will not be easy, but this is great competitive positioning for the LBS giant.<p>What do you think of Foursquare's move?",1292959158

I actually think the answer is simply - because the life sciences are in their infancy. It&#x27;s like asking a medieval astronomer why it&#x27;s so difficult to fly to the moon.<p>At the end of the day we do science with our brains, and our brains are not built to understand biology. How could they be? To really be able to understand even the simplest, isolated biological process, you probably need to hold at least a thousand bits of data in working memory. You can build a model on a computer, but we still don&#x27;t know what the important bits of data are out of many millions, we don&#x27;t know when they are missing, and we don&#x27;t know when our model begins to be valid and ceases to be valid.<p>In contrast, a physicist can gain deep insight about the ENTIRE universe while sitting under a tree with a pen and paper and some cogent abstractions. Furthermore, this insight is valid backwards and forwards in time except in clearly obvious extreme conditions.<p>This is actually completely amazing when you think about it. We would like to think the same about biology, and scientists act this way, but we would be mistaken. Abstractions fail in biology. Even the most basic and obvious abstractions made by humans, like the concept of a gene, are too simple to act as a foundation for ongoing discovery. And we don&#x27;t have any alternative framework.",1442141564

Was Hitler&#x27;s anti-Semitism that different from the anti-Semitism of his contemporaries, including many responsible for actually implementing his Holocaust?<p>Then again, I&#x27;ve always thought that attempts to &quot;understand Hitler&quot; in isolation from other expansionist military leaders might be missing the point. Hitler was exceptional in the number of simultaneous wars he managed to start and people he managed to kill (and unusual in his activities taking place in many living people&#x27;s memory) but that seems to have as much to do with geography and technology as his worldview being more inherently destructive. The general mixture of personality cult, rigid organization of domestic society and accelerating expansionism and ethnic cleansing fits a pattern of empire builders that stretches back across millennia, as do other things. Indeed Hitler fits this pattern <i>far better</i> than most of the other butchers of the 20th century, not least when you consider his obsession with monumental architecture and fondness for Speer and his &quot;theory of ruin value&quot;[1].<p>The bigger cause for concern for humanity might be that many of these admired earlier empire builders - their victims dead in some cases for millennia - are as admired today as they were in Hitler&#x27;s day.<p>[1]Of course Snyder can posit an alternative explanation for that last bit.",1442140500

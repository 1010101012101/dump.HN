In some ways, perhaps knowing the framework for how chunks of information relate to each other, or how to traverse it, will be more important than knowing the information itself.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to posit that HTTP and the indexing engines built on top of it is that framework.

10673644,comment,10671839,10672641,0,0,moonchrome,,,">I love writing Clojure(Script) code, but I hate reading it. It fits perfectly with the way I think (when I&#x27;m writing code), but horribly with the way I try to understand code I wrote months ago.<p>I&#x27;ve used Clojure for 2 years - I feel the same way. It&#x27;s a wonderfull language that exposed me to great ideas and showed me that simple things can be simple but boy does it get nasty when things don&#x27;t fit the provided primitives and actually start getting complex - the language has no tools to deal with complexity it can&#x27;t simplify.<p>Also a - for CLJS from me is that they haven&#x27;t abstracted out the (do ...) macro from channels (ironic with all those talks harping on how simplicity is about disentangling things). The biggest pain in JS/DOM ecosystem is shitty  semantics, poor standard library and callback stacks. ClojureScript fixes first two really well and does a half-assed job at fixing the last - channels are too much overhead for such task (from both performance and conceptual POV - putting a queue in front of every callback is silly in a single threaded model).<p>I feel like Elm is a language designed to explore an idea not to be practical, this is why I haven&#x27;t tried using it for anything serious.<p>TypeScript has potential in theory to bring ES6 + type safety to avoid semantic pitfalls - but in practice it&#x27;s supposedly biggest strength of leveraging the existing JS ecosystem is also it&#x27;s greatest weakness in that you&#x27;re still left there with shitty JS ecosystem with zero consistency, most libraries deal with JS pitfalls in their own unique way which doesn&#x27;t mesh well with other approaches or with TS, fragmented build, packing, dependency management, module loading tools - all trying to solve the same problem in different and incompatible ways - it&#x27;s just a pile of junk that wastes more time trying to reuse stuff than it takes to build anything - which is probably why most of it is in the state it is - and very few things are actually maintained so the argument that reinventing something means you need to maintain it yourself is not really convincing.<p>Dart has a built in package manager, has had tools for dealing with async code for a while now (both async/await and streams), it&#x27;s familiar to the Java/C# devs but it&#x27;s surprisingly concise (quite a few nice touches like constructor property-parameter mapping or => getter syntax for tedious stuff), the standard library is great and avoids all the JS pitfalls.<p>The downside is that you still need JS interop because there&#x27;s no way around it (for eg. emscripten) - and talking to JS from Dart is still nasty - much more involved than CLJS or TS.<p>Having used all 3 mentioned for non trivial work I like Dart the most and the new JS interop could make it even better.",1449186868

Of course, the set of macros that can update a place is user-extensible.

In the 2000&#x27;s, I worked at a startup developing spectrum-sharing radio technology.[1] We ran into a range of problems similar to what I believe will hold up autonomous car development:<p>1) When you scale from individual autonomous devices to vast networks of them you run into emergent phenomena that you simply could not predict ahead of time.<p>2) You have to spend enormous engineering effort protecting incumbents. E.g. there has been a ton of work on figuring out how to protect wireless microphones used by churches and stadiums. They are intermittent and have a &quot;dumb receiver&quot; (that never transmits), making them very difficult to handle using a &quot;listen before talk&quot; approach. And that&#x27;s for fricking church PAs. Imagine the push-back when your technological edge case runs over a kid.<p>3) You can&#x27;t deploy commercially until you change the regulatory regime. That can take years to decades if you&#x27;re asking for seismic shifts in policy.<p>I would predict another 5-10 years before the technology works correctly at scale, rather than under controlled conditions. Then maybe another 5-10 years after that for limited regulatory approval, and maybe 10-25 years for widespread regulatory approval. I don&#x27;t expect to be able to catch a self-driving cab in New York or Chicago before 2040.<p>[1] The end goal was technologies that could obsolete fixed spectrum allocation by letting networks of cognitive radios sort out for themselves what frequencies to use.

They don&#x27;t know how to program well. The code they put out is usually garbage, hard to read, and fragile. Software development is not something they do. Backing up for them is emailing themselves a .zip file of their work and revision control is saving their DocXs and PPTs with different dates in the filename.<p>My point is, coding is not something they enjoy, or care about, it&#x27;s just a means to an end. The environment and tooling around R/Python still cannot compare to Matlab in terms of ease of use, for the things that Mathworks (creators of Matlab) care enough about to write a toolbox or gui wizard for. The value is not in the language, or syntax, but in the libraries and tooling.

10673588,comment,10657999,10666981,0,0,msandford,,,"So I guess I would respectfully disagree with a lot of what you say based on underlying assumptions.  At first it doesn&#x27;t matter how land efficient or inefficient these things are; they have to actually really for reals work and prove that they have durability and whatnot.  There&#x27;s a decent chance they won&#x27;t and if so, how tightly you can pack them is 100% irrelevant.<p>> Windmills are sited such that they are rarely idle, it happens but that&#x27;s money being lost and a very large amount of the pre-work in siting a wind power park is to make sure that idle time is as low as possible. Yes, it is nice they&#x27;re stowed when not in use but that&#x27;s a situation you want to avoid.<p>Well, sort-of.  Traditional windmills are fairly expensive per watt and they can only be financed when they&#x27;re turning all the time.  But if your kite system only cost 10% of a traditional windmill then it only has to turn 10% as much as a regular windmill.  Further, that&#x27;s <i>before</i> you start factoring in the cost of actually moving the power from where the windmill <i>generates power</i> to where people <i>use power</i>.  I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like in Europe for sure (though from what I can tell there are problems), but I can tell you that it&#x27;s a nightmare here in the US.  Dollars per watt generated are important, but ultimately what governs feasibility is dollars per watt delivered.  If you have to spend $1b to put up new transmission lines to your $200mm ideally located, perfectly productive wind park, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.<p>If these kites are much, much cheaper than everything else you could end up seeing a sort of paradigm shift like computing saw; at first instruction execution was expensive and latency was &quot;free&quot; but eventually execution got cheap and latency got expensive.  Is it a perfect analogy?  No.  But there&#x27;s some wisdom hidden, perhaps.<p>EDIT: I read your longer write-up on the issue and perhaps they&#x27;re not talking about power per meter of rotor, but power per dollar.

But in fact these are not special: one of the surprising features of Swift is that inouts work on computed properties. For example, say we add a mutable property highHalf on UInt64:<p><pre><code>    extension UInt64 {\n        var highHalf : UInt32 {\n            get { return UInt32(self >> 32) }\n            set { self = (self & 0xFFFFFFFF) | (UInt64(newValue) << 32) }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow you can do this:<p><pre><code>    var x = UInt64.max\n    x.highHalf -= 1\n</code></pre>\nSo complex references can be used for any inout.

Not to mention the fact that I fail to see the difficulty here. Increment/decrement take literally a few minutes to explain and understand.<p>Actually, it&#x27;s more difficult to explain the concept of a function call, so let&#x27; propose to remove functions instead and stick with goto and global variables because they are easy to explain to a novice.<p>> Their expressive advantage is minimal - x++ is not much shorter than x += 1.<p>Increment/decrement looks visually more compact. (x += 1) looks hideous, has this &quot;magic constant&quot; and has 3 extra chars. Not to mention, x++ <i>does</i> have the expressive advantage, because it has entirely different semantics: &quot;return value THEN increment&quot;, while x += 1 doesn&#x27;t return anything in Swift (which is mentioned right in the next entry).<p>> Code that actually uses the result value of these operators is often confusing and subtle to a reader/maintainer of code. They encourage &quot;overly tricky&quot; code which may be cute, but difficult to understand.<p>It is not if you actually understand the semantics of those operators. Writing things like &quot;return currentSize++;&quot;\nis perfectly clear (assuming you know the meaning of the operator) and more concise and less noisy  compared to something like &quot;currentSize += 1; return currentSize;&quot;.<p>> While Swift has well defined order of evaluation, any code that depended on it (like foo(++a, a++)) would be undesirable even if it was well-defined.<p>By that logic, again, function calls should be banned. foo(bar(a), baz(b)) where bar and baz have side effects is also undesirable.<p>> These operators are applicable to relatively few types: integer and floating point scalars, and iterator-like concepts. They do not apply to complex numbers, matrices, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is relevant at all. There are lots of operations that are only applicable to certain types. It doesn&#x27;t mean such operations should be removed. You can&#x27;t compute the sine of a matrix or a complex number yet you wouldn&#x27;t remove sin(). You can&#x27;t compare two complex numbers or two matrices but I don&#x27;t see operators < and > going anywhere.<p>> Swift has powerful features that eliminate many of the common reasons you&#x27;d use ++i in a C-style for loop in other languages, so these are relatively infrequently used in well-written Swift code. These features include the for-in loop, ranges, enumerate, map, etc.<p>True, but when it does become necessary I&#x27;d rather have that functionality available. I see no need to handicap the language this way.<p>> Having to support these could add complexity to the potential revised numerics model.<p>This might be the only valid (and the real) reason for removal... but I don&#x27;t have enough information to comment on this.",1449184880

I worked with Clojure professionally for 2 years and had started to think that I was the odd one out since everyone else I worked with was just gushing over the readability of the code. At times it could be easy to read, but very often I found it hard to follow and would have to spend more time then others deconstructing what was happening.<p>Which is not to say that I didn&#x27;t like working with Clojure. I very much did. But it always seemed to be such a chore to read others code or code I hadn&#x27;t seen in a few months or more. I remember on occasion showing some snippets of code to a co-worker and commenting that I thought there was too much &quot;clever&quot; code in there, that it was too dense and hard to follow. The co-worker didn&#x27;t agree with me though, and I guess I just resigned myself to the idea that I was the odd one out here or something.<p>Ultimately, I think I ended up coming to the same conclusion as you. My way of thinking (and reading code apparently) just clicks so very much better with typed languages.<p>(I hope no one reads my post and treats this as some kind of attack on Clojure/Lisp and s-exps.

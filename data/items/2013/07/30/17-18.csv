This is a kind of core principle in rationality - sort of the little sister of noticing confusion[1]. I think I&#x27;m pretty well trained at noticing surprise and using at as a signal to look for more information, and that was, in fact the purpose of my comment.<p>I don&#x27;t post comments to demonstrate my cleverness (I hope). I post to tell about an interesting experience, make a careful argument, answer a question about which I&#x27;m knowledgeable, or solicit feedback. An expression of surprise for me is a solicitation for information. I was hoping someone with more domain knowledge would have some insight that I could integrate into my model. I realize that some people do just post comments to show their cleverness, and there&#x27;s no way you could have known my intent without knowing me, so that feedback is well taken. I&#x27;ll try to be clearer in the future about my intent.<p>I absolutely agree that what I said probably wouldn&#x27;t work - no need to apologize!

I think it&#x27;s more about having alternatives to official reporting channels so the stuff never actually gets reported, vs. hiding reports.  But, we&#x27;ve seen citizen cameras as a huge force to accountability in cases of police abuse, too (Rodney King for a city PD; BART and Toronto for transit police, various people who came forward at Penn State after the Sandusky stuff blew the issue up there).  So it seems plausible.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the only thing the police do is hide rapes, it&#x27;s that their essential differentiation vs. other LEOs would be to protect their employers from embarrassment which would be detrimental to the organization&#x27;s mission, which rape would be.

She generalizes to <i>all</i> cognitive resources being finite...<p><i>If your UX asks the user to make choices, for example, even if those choices are both clear and useful, the act of deciding is a cognitive drain.

Android is an open cross platform technology for building operating systems that are app-compatible with each other.

New developer features of ios7 are a new user interface, better location services, background push notifications etc. All of these things are available on android-based systems as well, but none of these things depend on the Android version.<p>I admit that there are also APIs that are part of Android, and therefore only available in newer versions.

Income is not wealth. Most things you own are liabities (costing you to keep them), instead of assets (earning you money by keeping them.) The point is, they aren&#x27;t and never were near poverty. But now they invested enough of their income so that they don&#x27;t need to work to live comfortably, they are pretty much rich. For example, they purchased their house.

I dont know exactly what was going through his mind. If I had known those things on January 11, if I had even known the right questions to ask, maybe I could have stopped him. Since January 11, I think about it every hour of every day.</i><p>> <i>The Aaron I knew was active. He worked out most days until he got the flu two weeks before he died.</i><p>It&#x27;s hard to second-guess someone who lived with Aaron and say, &quot;Well, us armchair psychologists know better than you&quot;...but the fact is, Taren was the closest person to Aaron and yet can&#x27;t identify any particular warning signs that Aaron was going to kill himself. She provides compelling evidence that the trial was a huge burden on Aaron...but the question here is: <i>why suicide on that day?</i> There was a procedural deadline, but it didn&#x27;t seem much more of a conclusive event than anything so far. It&#x27;s not as if Aaron had been convicted, was on house arrest, and had just heard his appeal had been denied.<p>But as Taren said, Aaron was unusually sick up until the day of his suicide...at least sick enough to stop exercising, which, pedantic as it sounds, is a <i>huge</i> factor in mood swings. Enough to cause someone to commit suicide?...<p>Who knows? I guess why this all bothers me is that, by arguing that Aaron&#x27;s death was conclusively caused by malicious actors perpetuates the misunderstanding that suicide and depression are, in general, caused by life circumstances....but it seems that some depression is due to physiological factors that aren&#x27;t related to the &quot;bigger picture&quot;. People who face horrific tragedy don&#x27;t often kill themselves; people who seem to live in enviable circumstances sometimes do.<p>The world would make more sense if everyone committed suicide out of fear, hopelessness, or even weakness (as those who accused Aaron of &quot;rage-quitting&quot; seemed to do)...but this isn&#x27;t the case, and this belief is unhelpful for those who suffer depression because of physiological, treatable factors...but who may avoid treatment because they think, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m not being persecuted, so I must not really be depressed and thus have no reason to seek help&quot;<p>I know I&#x27;m being naively idealistic here...because if Aaron hadn&#x27;t died, if he had only suffered a drawn out trial and even a conviction, the call to reform the U.S attorney&#x27;s office and the MIT administration would have much more diffuse support without the catalyst of his death. But I do think it&#x27;s worth being mindful that the issue of treating depression isn&#x27;t obfuscated.<p>Either way, what a tragedy. Reading Taren&#x27;s words again really underscores how much of a loss Aaron&#x27;s death was for civic reform.",1375206147

Tipping, they maintained, undermined the dignity and independence of citizens in a democracy. Let us not congratulate the servants on their gain, one writer admonished, for no servant takes a tip without losing something of manhood or womanhood. Another argued that to accept a tip is to enter into a relationship of dependence to the giver and by implication to acknowledge his superiority. Frank Crane, a syndicated columnist, contended that the tip put waiters into a class with the beggar, or the receiver of a bribe. And Alvin Harlow, a historian popular at the time, wrote: What, may I ask, is more un-American than tipping? It doesnt belong in American society; it doesnt belong in a democracy.

My understanding is that is primarily for jurisdictional reasons. But, it is also because way back in the day (300baud dail-up era) the majority of computer crime was related to the anti-counter fitting mandate that Secret Service has (like fake credit cards, fake vital documents, and fake currency). Computer crime was a new thing and most people didn&#x27;t have PC&#x27;s yet (or computer skills) so there wasn&#x27;t an agency that was a great fit. The FBI didn&#x27;t want it. So, in many places Secret Service got it.<p>Any computer crime in Mass is will almost always have Secret Service involved. New Hampshire and Maine are a little different.

If different users can tag the same post you start having to ask other interesting questions regarding permissions and ownership. The model I&#x27;m looking at is more blogger or delicious: the posts by users are distinct, and are owned on data records that are owned by those users. In the delicious case, we are all tagging the same URL eventually, but each user is really submitting a post for a URL with its own tag cloud. You cannot add tags to my post: you have to make your own post that references the same URL and put tags on that. The semantics of groups of people tagging things sounds awkward for arrays (and the one system I&#x27;ve built that was similar to that, where tags actually have ownership and permissions on their use even, did not go down this route).<p>=====<p>(I wrote the following <i>before</i> noticing the incompatibility of your &quot;a user somehow tagged something&quot; case with my mental model of what we meant by tags; I still think it might be valuable, though.) I think that you are focussing on a narrow use of tags where all they can do is &quot;list entries tagged by&quot;; if that&#x27;s all you are doing, then go ahead and use the repation.<p>However, please understand that the app didn&#x27;t &quot;complexify&quot; as you added those data items, and the data model didn&#x27;t somehow improve to handle them: you <i>lost</i> the ability to do queries of the form &quot;find documents similar to this one&quot; without doing heroics. This is a trivial single select order by operator query with a cloud, and this is nearly impossible to represent using a separate relation.<p>Now, think about the new queries you just wanted to perform: they were on properties not of present-tense taggings, but of past-tense ones. If someone adds a tag in the morning, and later deletes it, your business intelligence query still cares that they added that tag in the morning. This means you can&#x27;t ever delete records, and end up adding &quot;deleted&quot; keys. This, in turn, makes your unique indexes require predicates, as all of your queries. It also means your &quot;hot&quot; user data includes &quot;dead&quot; information it has to sift through.<p>Again, you&#x27;re going to try to tell me this is a &quot;micro optimization&quot;, but I&#x27;m going to say the exact opposite: for one ninche use case that end users don&#x27;t even interact with, you made your app harder to implement (as the relation ways of accessing the tags is more awkward to code), less functional and slower (as now some queries are impossible at worst, often now unindexable when possible, and even at the best being bogged down by skipping data that serves a different purpose). This is the same argument against micro-optimization.<p>Instead, I urge you to consider business intelligence issues as fundamentally different than your functionality issues. The way to solve this problem is to store events I how tags are use in a separate database, possibly a totally different kind of database, that is setup to store historical information of every tagging event that ever occurred (or, even, starts compressing this information into time windows). There is a reason why BI-specific database solutions exist, or why Amazon offers both red shift and DynamoDB: they are just different things.",1375204213

6128351,comment,6127049,6128000,5,0,brucehart,,,"You are absolutely right about the small niches. What the public hears about is a tiny fraction of the successes (and failures) that are actually out there. If you are lucky enough to find a profitable niche then you don&#x27;t invite competition to take it away from you. There are several examples that I personally know about that have never been shared with the public.<p>One example is a personal friend of mine. He developed a B2C software product for a particular niche that you wouldn&#x27;t think was very large or profitable. He doesn&#x27;t talk about what he does publicly or even read entrepreneur sites like Hacker News. If someone were to show me his app and ask me how long it would take for me to develop it I would say &quot;three weeks: two to code it and one more to make it that ugly&quot;. And yet this guy makes a ton of money (much more than a typical software engineer) essentially for just handling the occasional support or billing issue.<p>Another example was a guy I worked for in college in the early 2000s. He got in early in the business sending out e-mail newsletters for professional organizations.  He bought a license of a high-end e-mail program for about $15k, bought about $5k in server hardware and spent about $750/mo. in co-location fees. Then he hired me and another college student to work remotely part-time at $15-$20/hr. to handle the server administration and support. Add all that up and his total costs were about $20k up front and $2500/mo. The only work he would do is go to conferences a couple times a year and do a couple of sales calls a month. He generally kept the details of his financials hidden from me, but I know that at least a couple of his clients were paying over $5000/mo. each. When you consider he had a couple dozen organizations as customers, that is very impressive for something that is almost completely passive with no technical skills required.",1375204013
6128350,comment,6125665,6126139,2,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I sympathise with that concern, and anecdotally Im still waiting to encounter a feature-toggled project in my own work where the maintenance overheads didnt quickly become painful out of all proportion to the benefits.<p>It was bad enough in the days of #ifdef driven development in C, where the meaning of your code and even your entire software design could change based on an arbitrary set of macros that didnt respect scope, didnt offer any type safety, and might be defined anywhere: a random header file, a makefile setting some command line option, or just some environment variable on one particular developers PC that they set three years ago and forgot about. Making a controlled, reproducible build that you actually trust to be what you think it is is very difficult in that kind of environment.<p>Its even worse with dynamically typed languages, because now you dont even have compile-time warnings about redundant code or type safety guarantees on the code <i>inside</i> the feature checks to prove it would run sensibly. To me, it feels like the whole strategy plays right into the major downsides of using dynamic types. No doubt some people would disagree with me, and would never dream of writing code without comprehensive test suites that back it up and are known to have 100% coverage with every possible combination of features toggled in or out. (If you really think you are in this position, I know a guy whod like to offer you an exclusive financial deal guaranteed to make you rich, if you just send a 25K deposit up-front in unmarked, non-sequential notes to his mailbox in Nigeria.)<p>What really bugs me is that this whole feature toggling premise seems to be caused by the tail wagging the dog. Feature toggling is advocated as a way to do continuous integration. CI is advocated as a way to avoid nightmare merges. However, the existence of nightmare merges presupposes that you can have multiple developers simultaneously working on the same part of your code, making sufficiently intricate changes that merging will cause headaches, but for different reasons and without being aware of each other. Otherwise, they could just communicate effectively, and merge intelligently as they go along if that makes sense. How can any development team possibly get into that situation without some spectacular, fundamental failure of project management and technical leadership? That kind of failure is essentially a social problem, so its doubtful that any kind of technical solution could solve it reliably, whether a branching model, or a CI-not-branching model, or any other model for that matter.",1375203999

Chili&#x27;s, for example, requires that you check back within 3 minutes of serving the main course.  Also, at my store, they required that you take the order down on one knee in order to seem more &quot;casual&quot;.  Bleh.  I didn&#x27;t do it.",1375203676

For example, cold-calling a non-tech-savvy mom & pop store to become a partner in your online venture.<p>- One good passive income generator is not enough for the long-haul.  One will need 3 - 5 different niches to be comfortable for many years to come.  There is lots of volatility and some niches will eventually fail.<p>- The only real passive thing about passive income is that your websites are running while you sleep.  There is always day-to-day work.<p><i>Finding new opportunities</i><p>- Once you find a good niche and quit your day job, you will try to create new businesses in other niches and fail dozens of times.  It may take 2 - 3 years to find or create another viable niche or business.  This can be soul-crushing if your expectations are not set.  However, all of the tech created in those failures <i>will</i> come in use in the future.<p>- My [current] most successful way of finding new opportunities is to do contracting work for small businesses.  They always have lots of problems and deep knowledge of their niche.  Keep a conversation going with those small businesses and start creating solutions for them.",1375203666

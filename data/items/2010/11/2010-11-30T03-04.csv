1953000,comment,1952077,1952493,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Human beings and other large mammals suppress their telomerase.  Why?  Because it can save them from cancer.  If the cancer cells never mutate to activate their telomerase or the alternative pathway for fixing telomeres, they start to malfunction and die off before the tumor gets larger than about an inch across.  Often, this isn't such a big deal for a human.  For a mouse, it's a really big deal and they'll probably die.  Hence, there's no anti-cancer benefit for a mouse to suppress telomerase, so they're designed to have it ""on"" all the time.<p>Whales almost never die of cancer.  By the time a cancer gets as large as a human's head, the cancer cells have mutated into dysfunction or parasitism of other tumor cells.  Tumors that have been around long enough to get that big tend to die off.  For a whale, a tumor the size of a human head is no big deal.  The folks that still kill whales (for ""research"") find tumor scars in whales all the time.  They just seem to shrug it off.<p>Activating a human being's telomerase in the fashion discussed in the article would likely bring about an early death of cancer.",1291089155

They’re transmitted via e-mail in PDF form on a State Department network called ClassNet, but they’re stored in PST form on servers and are searchable. If Manning’s unit needed to know whether Iranian proxies had acquired some new weapon, the information might be contained within a diplomatic cable. All any analyst has to do is to download a PST file with the cables, unpack them, SNAP them up or down to a computer that is capable of interacting with a thumb drive or a burnable CD, and then erase the server logs that would have provided investigators with a road map of the analyst's activities.

</code></pre>
This can be read as implying that Australians at-large are responsible. This isn't really true, it's an anomaly of our voting system (proportional representation in the Senate on a per-state basis) that sometimes leads to bad policy.<p>So, for example, the retarded-policy bandwagon got rolling when Senator Harradine from Tasmania held the balance of power. He was able to block bills in the Senate and he used that power to get a lot of what he wanted, including bulk pork for Tasmania and some stupid internet policies.<p>In the current Senate one of the cross-benchers (who can sometimes affect the outcome of votes, depending on what the Greens and other cross-benchers do) is Senator Fielding, a member of a speaking-in-tongues, happy-clappy christian party. One of their pet peeves is pornography, they think it makes god most displeased. Hence the government has been dangling the filtering stuff for years to help secure his vote.<p>Technology-wise the current big argument is about a ""National Broadband Network"" a AU$50 billion (or $35 billion, depending on how you count) project to tear up Australia's copper network and replace it with fibre. To every home in the country. In US terms that's approximately like a $630 billion project (ie ~4.3% of GDP).",1291087826

First, this happens in corporations and other organizations. Since this knowledge is power, the state can't let this go on for very long, and it will demand access to this data. This process is in full swing in Europe with things like the Data Retention Directive and various Echelon clones.<p>The people can't let the state have all this power, since it's an absurd power advantage which people are rightly afraid leads to an Orwellian society. They will protest with things like the Pirate Party.<p>There is another way of undermining this information advantage, however, which is to disclose information instead of trying to hide it from certain entities. If you tell everyone what you do, you can't be blackmailed, for instance. In my view, things like Facebook and Twitter are symptoms of this. When my mom goes on about why people broadcast what they had for breakfast, I usually tell her that they are subverting the power.<p>Zuckerberg, Schmidt and Assange have understood this and are acting and speaking accordingly.<p>The only other way forward, in my view, is ubiquitous end-to-end encryption between individuals. I'm not so sure that would be a good thing, and I don't see how it could work if the current trend of communication and transactions being concentrated in fewer and fewer hubs will continue, since that means someone has access to at least timestamp and communicating parties.<p>If we can reverse that and decentralize, encryption between ""power symmetric"" parties might work. But then, it might not be necessary.",1291086305

1952857,comment,1950123,1950936,0,0,nocman,,,"Just to be clear, I didn't describe Lisp as ""natural"", I described using the STL (meaning, particularly, heavy use of STL algorithms, function objects, etc) as feeling terribly unnatural and forced.  Judging by the reaction here, ""unnatural"" was perhaps not the best choice of words.  What I meant was this: when trying to use the STL to get stuff done, I felt like I was always jumping through hoops to do things ""the STL way"", with the end result being more complicated and less clear than just doing it in a ""C++ without the STL"" way.<p>> I can guarantee you that Lisp showed to a novice isn't ""natural"".<p>Again, I never argued that Lisp was ""natural"".  And secondly, if you are dealing with a true novice (as in, someone who has never programmed in any programming language), both C++ and Lisp are going to look decidedly ""unnatural"" to them.  But I don't want to beat the natural/unnatural language dead horse any longer, since that was not what I was discussing.  However, I will concede that Lisp looks decidedly foreign to people who <i>have</i> programmed before in languages with an Algol-like syntax (C, C++, Java, Javascript, Perl, etc).<p>And, for the record, I am <i>very</i> proficient in C++ (many years of work experience), and I understand how the STL works very well (I invested a <i>lot</i> of time in learning the STL).  I invested that time because I wanted to make C++ do more than it had done for me in the past, and the STL seemed like the way to do that.  However, in the end I decided that there really was no good way to make C++ do what I wanted, and the real answer was to go with something that was far better at handling higher level constructs.  After trying out Lisp (and Scheme) for I while I realized that the primary things I was trying to do with the STL were no-brainers in Lisp.  And with a decent FFI I can still use C or C++ when I need to do things at a lower level.  I still use C++ libraries when it makes sense to do so, but I would not now start a new project with C++ as the primary language if given the choice to use something else (unless, of course, the only choices were something even worse than C++ :-D ).",1291086025

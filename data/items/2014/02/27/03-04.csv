I&#x27;ve stayed here in Bangalore all my life.<p>>>getting around people unwilling to confront their managers<p>Almost every time I&#x27;ve tried to do this, I&#x27;ve been screwed. The only option after that even I have is to go work under a different manager. You really have to play nice, actually that&#x27;s putting in mildly. You have to show super sycophancy towards your manager, if you want anything that looks like a raise, promotion or a foreign travel.<p>Often you are just screwed if you don&#x27;t belong to your manager&#x27;s state, or don&#x27;t speak his mother tongue.<p>I&#x27;ve been pulled up and scolded inside meeting rooms even for mild and faint feedback, let alone direct confrontation. Some times in the line of &#x27;You don&#x27;t want me as your enemy&#x27;.<p>That&#x27;s one big reason why Indian IT is such deep irrecoverable mess. Good people get nothing, have no scope for growth. If you are good its assumed you are going to sacrifice your life working for everybody. To get anything you have to be a super sycophant. Or belong to your manager&#x27;s state or speak his/her mother tongue.<p>So the only option for good people here is:<p>1. Immigrate to a western country. Get treated like crap. If you are luck you might get citizenship in a decade or two. Else get ready to go through putting up with crap for years.<p>2. Work in smaller teams of your mindset and do a start up.",1393473392

The word &quot;fail&quot; implies you should reach that point only if there was an error, but that is a bad assumption in this case.<p>If the real answer to &#x27;how did we get here?&#x27; was checked, then the bug could not hide in the undefined behavior.  This would not allow a dangling goto to result in a false positive.

However, Java does not do this. What Java does is lower the intelligence required to make changes <i>without understanding the system</i>, by having few abstractions and effectively making the programmer work in an intermediate language with added redundancy.<p>And while this approach allows for cheaper unskilled programmers to be used, they take up more time figuring out what to attempt to change and then crossing their fingers hoping the code will compile. A similar amount could have been spent for an intelligent consultant working in a high level language and serving several such clients, but management would rather feel secure by having someone they control.<p>> <i>I&#x27;m explaining why a healthy corporation</i><p>Once it&#x27;s in the territory of hiring more people instead of better people, you have something that prioritizes control over obtaining results, which is not healthy.

It just seems to work better.<p>I only got my self-hosted version running last night and couldn&#x27;t seem to spot a &quot;chat&quot; option (had two different browsers open) but for any file that was open by two people, you got to see who was editing what within the file.<p>When I was running c9, I couldn&#x27;t even get the console to display. I found a plethora of issues in their github issue tracker of other people with the same problem, as well as code suggestions to fix it, but virtually no response on any issue from the c9 people.<p>I reported an issue I was having with codebox on their tracker. First I thought it was a bug, then I found a workaround (set the USER environment variable before starting codebox). I reported that on the issue, suggesting a documentation update, and within an hour, they had committed new code that made the workaround unnecessary.<p>So for self-hosted, I think codebox has the more stable and actively developed codebase while c9&#x27;s open-source version is more of an afterthought.

On the very first flight, STS-1, there was a serious problem with the body flap on the orbiter caused by an overpressure wave from the SRBs, John Young, the commander of the flight, said that if he had known of the problem during takeoff he would have bailed out during launch. Later flights had other, equally serious problems. STS-8 came very close to suffering the same fate as Challenger. STS-9 could have easily been lost if the computer crashes that occurred in flight happened during re-entry or to the fire and explosion of 2 out of 3 of its auxiliary power units, which occurred just after touchdown, fortunately. STS-27 suffered sever TPS damage and could easily have been lost just as Columbia was.<p>For many of these issues NASA worked on fixing them but never acknowledged the full extent of the risk and mostly just pretended that everything was OK up until something bad happened. If the fires on STS-9 never occurred an APU disaster could have resulted in loss of a crew during a flight.

Before Google, Microsoft was infamous for being one of the few places in tech having a 1 day interview. They flew you out to Seattle and gave you brain teasers. People realized the brain teasers didn&#x27;t work and they just transformed into white board coding interviews. But that was just Microsoft. Then, Google came on the scenes and started paying more than Microsoft. I remember starting salaries jumping from 60K to 80K around 2004-2005. That was likely a direct result of Google. At the same time, Google copied the Microsoft hiring process, which was not the industry average to begin with. In fact, they made it harder. The whole ... hire people smarter than you crap started. The Google anti-interview loop was born (the hypothesis is that every employee at Google has a set of 5 people who, if they were on their interview loop, would reject the employee for their current job). People whose first jobs were around 2004 think this is the way it should be for everyone. And then, we are in our current situation where startups can&#x27;t find anyone qualified to hire and job seekers find it impossible to get employed.<p>I think what this does is lower programmer mobility and encourage more people to do startups.

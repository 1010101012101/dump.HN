3905762,comment,3904772,3904772,7,0,jasongill,,,"Reposting my GitHub comment:<p>Thanks all for your comments. Regarding responsible disclosure, I'm aware of the concept. I did Google around and looked on the WooThemes site for a security notice address or similar and didn't find one. Even as a paying subscription customer, which I have happily been for the past year, the only way to get support is via their public forum.<p>That being said, this is only ""half"" of the equation. I have already seen numerous hosting accounts compromised via a more malicious form of this attack which I have not published. In fact, finding a number of sites running WooThemes all compromised in the past 4 days via the contents of shortcode-generator/ lead me to take a quick look through the code to try to find the attack vector and I found this.<p>Note that what I found isn't even really an exploit in its current form - just a bug which combined with a lot more work could be used to potentially cause harm. However, since I'm already seeing WooThemes-powered sites that have been compromised via the contents of shortcode-generator/, there is already a more serious problem in the wild. I would hope that WooThemes is aware of that - but again, they don't appear to have any security contact address, or any other transparency about the security of their products to be able to find out.<p>With regards to security at WooThemes, I won't comment on their attack this week because clearly they are trying to recover from it. However, as one commenter in HackerNews posted, ""Does this look like the authors even give a crap about security?"" and with that I would tend to agree. For example, a few days prior to their site going down, WooThemes alerted their customers to update their themes for a security vulnerability... via a 5am tweet: <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/woothemes/status/192545687051829248"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/woothemes/status/192545687051829248</a>  ""We found a minor vulnerability in the WooFramework, which we've just fixed. Please update to the latest version ASAP!""  Not an email alert, not a blog post with details, just a tweet.<p>Regarding the person who commented that this issue was already patched; that is incorrect. This has been tested against vanilla WooThemes running the latest version, which (according to the theme's built in updater) is 5.3.7. The WooThemes website only lists a changelog up to version 5.3.1, released almost 2 months ago: <a href=""http://www.woothemes.com/updates/functions-changelog.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.woothemes.com/updates/functions-changelog.txt</a><p>Additionally, even if the issue is patched, my link above still works - which means that the patch clearly isn't working or hasn't been applied to WooThemes own servers.<p>The moral of this story is: WooThemes is a great company and makes a great product, but they have grown to the point where security needs to be a real concern. A proper channel to alert them of these issues, along with prompt and honest email notifications of updates to their customers (free and paid), and a publicly-accessible security/updates site (a la RedHat's RHSA system) are all long overdue. This isn't just a jab at WooThemes either - a review of almost any paid or free theme will surely come up with many issues like this.<p>Perhaps the best solution is for WordPress to add a built in update notifier that can alert site admins when updates are available, but at this point anything would be helpful.<p>Thanks again for the comments and thanks to those who posted simple patches to correct this small issue until an official update is released.",1335700345

(i.e. - stop teaching it to beginners)<p>It boils down to using the right tool for the job.  As the author mentions, some people do get it right, but it leaves you a lot of rope to hang yourself.<p>There is people who feel teaching rails or django to beginners is also doing them a disservice too, because at times it can mask how SQL or other things work, and can encourage developers to not learn how things work at a lower level.<p>Developers should learn SQL before noSQL, but I don&#x27;t think that will make or break a career, nor will learning node first or rails or php or java.<p>One key to being a diverse developer, is not being religious about any one technology, but try as many out as you can reasonably, and learn from all of them.<p>The author definitely nails this point, that people are often &quot;unwavering&quot; in how they support node (or insert another technology in that sentence).<p>TL;DR - use the right tool for the job.

9755341,comment,9743689,9744999,0,0,ta0967,,,">> Previous studies have led researchers to believe that individuals with social anxiety disorder or social phobia have too low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin. A new study, however, shows that the situation is exactly the opposite.<p>> It&#x27;s stuff like this that is destroying the reputation of science in general.<p>the actual paper contains no such language of course, let me quote the introduction:<p>> Anxiety disorders are debilitating psychiatric conditions that impose a considerable burden on patients1 and society,2 and social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common of these conditions.3 The neural underpinnings of excessive social anxiety are not fully characterized, although serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) has been suggested to be involved etiologically.4,5<p>> However, only a few studies have used molecular neuroimaging to examine serotonin dysfunction in SAD directly. A single-photon emission tomography study6 found increased serotonin transporter availability in the thalamus, but not in the raphe nuclei, in patients with SAD relative to healthy control individuals. Also, a positron emission tomography (PET) study7 showed that SAD is associated with reduced serotonin 1A receptor binding. Somatodendritic serotonin 1A autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei, which inhibit serotonin synthesis and release,8 and postsynaptic serotonin 1A heteroreceptors, which convey inhibitory signals in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula cortex, were downregulated.7 In addition, functional neuroimaging studies of SAD9 have demonstrated heightened, fear-induced neural reactivity in the amygdala, which is densely innervated by serotonin,10 with alterations in the hippocampus, ACC, insula cortex, and striatum.9,11 Moreover, the first line of pharmacologic treatment for SAD consists of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),12- 14 which reduce excessive amygdala reactivity, restore initially suppressed ventromedial prefrontal cortex response to emotional challenge,15- 18 and attenuate resting brain perfusion in the ACC and insula.19 Thus, findings from molecular and functional neuroimaging and treatment studies indicate that serotonergic neurotransmission in the amygdala, raphe nuclei, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, insula cortex, and ACC may be compromised in SAD.<p>> Given the inhibitory role of serotonin 1A autoreceptors on serotonin synthesis,8 previous findings of decreased autoreceptor binding in SAD7 may indicate increased serotonin formation and enhanced serotonergic activity. On the other hand, because blocking the serotonin reuptake with SSRIs attenuates social anxiety symptoms12,13 and because posttreatment dietary depletion of the serotonin precursor tryptophan reverses the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs,20 the notion that increased serotonin availability is pivotal for anxiety reduction also has support. Indeed, whether anxiety conditions such as SAD are best characterized by serotonin overactivity or underactivity remains a matter of debate.5",1434927273

It seems like a data format will only work for languages with a similar implementation to what the designers of the format had in mind?<p>As a simple example, how do you determine the type of a JavaScript object on the heap when each language implements runtime type tags differently, and each language has a different type system?<p>A language-specific JavaScript function running in the same heap can do whatever it likes to compute the type, including calling into the language&#x27;s runtime system. Furthermore, the Chrome API I linked to doesn&#x27;t even care what the type system is; all it cares is that the data can be somehow displayed in outline format.<p>Of course, this approach has its limitations too; it does assume that, at least at the top level of the outline, you start with a JavaScript object and there&#x27;s some way to compute a runtime type from it. This doesn&#x27;t work for an untagged language where we refer to objects using array indexes like with asm.js. So it&#x27;s not completely general.

Yes, most of the big name fast food chains in the US have switched to other oils, but it&#x27;s not clear whether all have or to what extent.

266282,comment,266266,266266,0,0,cperciva,,,"Don't do this.  This is no better than using a single fixed salt for an entire site: An attacker who has access to your password file can iterate through possible passwords and for each password perform <i>one</i> computation to check if that password matches <i>any</i> of your users.<p>The whole point of salting is to reduce an attacker to checking one possible user/password pair at once.  You don't get this benefit if you use the method described in this article.<p>The <i>only</i> attacker I can see this defending against is an attacker who has a precomputed table of password MD5s and doesn't have (hasn't bothered to create) a precomputed table of password-repeated-twice MD5s.  So technically the method described is slightly more secure than simply storing (user, MD5(password)) pairs, since it avoids the ""google to reverse MD5 hashes"" pseudo-attack.  But if you're going that low, you're pretty much lost already.<p>Don't do this.",1217860173

If someone knew or could guess you were using this tactic then they might be able to exploit it.<p>While I don’t have an example of a specific weakness to MD5 to hand one of the basic rules of exploiting algorithms is knowing some of the source material or knowing about patterns within it.<p>The point of using a salt is to use a piece of unknown material which is unique in each string. It’s common to generate random junk to use rather than anything meaningful.<p>Personally I always take ""new insight"" into security tactics with a pinch of salt until they have been hammered on by a few people.",1217860150

The ""nice women"" would be averse to marrying you if your number got too high. From the perspective of a marriage-worthy woman, it's fine to be a virgin till 23-25, and the ideal number for a 30-year-old male is probably 1-6.<p>How old are you? It seems that the odds get better for a guy until age 35. When you're 20, the age range of women you'll be able to date is very limited: approximately 18-21. When you're 35, it's 23-40. Gender ratios also improve (from a male perspective) dramatically as you age, with noticeable effects in dating. I'm 25 and loving it; I definitely don't miss being an acne-pwned, insecure 19-year-old.<p>Also, if you're looking for marriage-worthy women, have you considered moving abroad?

266264,comment,266193,266193,0,0,time_management,,,"The problem with organized religion of all kinds is that it tends to obsess over a concept of eternal and immutable truth, rather than accepting the possibility (and likelihood) of a multitude of paths to truth and liberation. This leads to a sort of legalism that detracts from the original purpose of the religion.<p>The original purpose of Shabbat in Judaism and Christianity is to devote one day out of seven to meditation and prayer, as well as to simulate the sinless state, in which there was no need for work, that existed before the Fall. There's nothing special about Saturday (or Sunday) as opposed to any other day, aside from the desire to have all observers recognize it on the same day. Before the modern era, the most common distraction from the meditative life was work, and hence the activities that are prohibited are those that were considered part of the ""work"" sphere in biblical times.<p>Organized religion tends to calcify, leading to strict rules that allow no exceptions. Hence, the question asked is not, ""Will using electricity distract from the meditative purpose of Shabbat?"" but ""Does electricity 'count' as a fire?"" Of course, one can't single out Judaism here, because significant components of all the major religions devolve into the same debates.",1217859020

At the time (I was there) on a typical large institutional or corporate Unix box you had C/C++/FORTRAN compilers for the engineers to use and Perl installed by the sysadmins for their own use, and that was pretty much it for languages. Getting a whole new language installed for a project that wasn't even ""official"" was a non-starter. The path of least resistance was to use Perl for CGIs. If Unix sysadmins had been into REXX instead, then that would have been the default choice. Now that most Unixes ship with several scripting languages installed already, people are free(r) to choose.

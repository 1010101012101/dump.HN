It uses Scheme to show how the fundamentals of programming languages are built, and both in its form and its content, it seems a direct continuation from SICP. After you've done with it, you'll have a much better understanding of Scheme, functional programming, programming languages, and programming in general.",1242446281

611814,comment,611246,611313,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"I dream of an automated fact-checker. Of course, to do it right you need Turing Test-passing AI. But if you start small, with the capability to parse a few statements of a few forms, that would still be useful.<p>I saw an argument on HN recently where people made these statements:<p>1. The UK is a much more violent society than the US, statistically.<p>2. There are dozens of U.S. cities with higher per capita murder rates than London or any other city in the UK.<p>3. Murder rates are higher in the US, but murder is a small fraction of violent crime. All other violent crime is much more common in the UK than in the US.<p>No-one provided sources; people asked for them later. Suppose HN ran an automated fact-checker over every sentence ever posted, searching for statements of the form:
""[country] is (much|a lot)? more [quality] than [country]"" - or a more sophisticated regex that captures more applicable cases.<p>And then, for the sentences that it understands, it checks the claim. Maybe it highlights incorrect statements in red, or just adds footnotes. This might make online debates more rigorous. Not only would a few statements be fact-checked, but the knowledge that a fact-checking program will look at your comment might incentivize people to be more careful with facts.<p>Newspapers and other media would find automated fact-checkers useful too.<p>Taking a longer view (like decades), with good speech-to-text technology, it could fact-check TV broadcasts in real-time. This should improve the debate quality not just of obscure internet forums, but also nationally-broadcast TV. Then, maybe, we'd see an improvement in the accuracy of all political debate, which should improve democracy.",1242444482

I have the right to jailbreak it, and in doing so forsake Apple's promise to help me when things to wrong.<p>Of course I have control. I just don't have control if I use both Apple's hardware and their software as Apple originally designed it. That's perfectly within Apple's jurisdiction as a company.<p>I understand why you might think that their stance is ridiculous, but think of it like this: Apple's design strategy is to make products that are foolproof. That means blocking something like a background application that might ruin my experience, even if that means taking away some of my control. It limits what I can do, but within those limits I'm relatively safer. When I download an application, there's no threat of it running in the background without my knowing and sapping my battery.<p>Is it incredible that I put up with my iPod? I know full well that I have control of who to purchase from. If I didn't want a closed system, I could go somewhere else. Nobody forced me to use Apple products. Their monopoly is not forced upon users; we accept it voluntarily. As a result, I get a music player/video player/miniature computer that does many things very effortlessly. When I buy an application, all I need to know is that it appears as a little button I can click to run it. When I want to add music to my iPod, all I do is make sure it's in iTunes, and then my player syncs. It's simple, and it means that I don't waste any of my time whatsoever with my iPod. It does everything I want and nothing I don't want.<p>I don't see why people find it hard to accept that some people want freedom at the cost of effortlessness, and others want effortlessness at the cost of freedom. It's not incredible or ridiculous. It's simply different philosophy.",1242443299

This has been going on for decades, and isn’t about Clinton per se (personally I detest the Clintons), but affects every type of election from local races on up.<p>For Republican politicians and operatives, it’s smart political strategy (at least in a short-term zero-sum kind of way, assuming the only goal is to win the next election rather than to govern effectively or build a stable society). Likewise, it’s smart political strategy for Democratic party politicians and operatives to make voter registration and voting easy and convenient, because on the margins the additional votes tend to go to Democrats.<p>On the bright side, voting rights for ex-felons have actually been improving somewhat over the last 20 years, even if that improvement is patchy and has regressed in some places. Unfortunately, many other types of voter suppression have gotten worse.",1433570211

That&#x27;s just an intermittent issue that Comcast customers deal with--I experienced that in Indiana a couple of months ago.<p>I believe that it relates to them re-jiggering routers such that the appropriate default gateway for your modem changes, but because your modem is already up, it doesn&#x27;t get notified of the change.  So the modem doesn&#x27;t send the message to the correct router, and the router it sends it to may or may not know how to get it to the destination.",1433567879

Sounds like what you&#x27;re describing is a situation where you have to modify your source code to add a breakpoint (similar to a &quot;debugger&quot; statement in JavaScript or C#). To me, the big value of an IDE is that it lets you set/unset breakpoints, step, inspect arbitrary data, and modify application state, all at runtime. Now, I still typically work in VIM and pop open an IDE/debugger only when I hit a hairy problem, but I still find them really useful in those cases.",1433567806

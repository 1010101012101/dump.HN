From professors in a law school, to FTC economists, to public policy and healthcare, economists will always end up in a diverse set of fields.

Finding a designer would be simple and 1k$ for the project would be too much already :) It would take a couple of months and be done with it.<p>The issue is to get on the store. And this is hard.<p>Why is that?<p>VLC (and its underlying libraries, including codecs, networking and demuxers) represents around 7M LoC of C, C++ and ASM. All of this is very C99 code and inline ASM. Visual Studio cannot eat that in any way. Believe me, we tried. A lot.
So we need to compile the VLC for Windows on Linux, using gcc+mingw.<p>Unfortunately, this does not work on WinRT (""Modern UI"" or whatever you like to call it). WinRT restricts a lot the Win32 APIs. And only Visual Studio knows which ones. Oh, and the BSD sockets are gone...<p>So, we need to change and update the toolchain, fix MingW for WinRT, rewrite the code that is using Win32 APIs since 10 years (and in all underlying libraries too...), write a new UI above this, fix the code using HWND for rendering, port the audio and video outputs, work-around the sandbox for DVD playback, probably write a WinSock2 replacement library to build all the cross-platform libraries that expect a BSD-socket-like library, etc...<p>Add to that the need to modify MingW to output dlls that we can load on ARM (Windows RT) and fix all the same different APIs for WP8.<p>Of course a lot of the work is not really on VLC, but on being able to compile for WinRT with open source tools, and a lot will be re-usable.<p>So, yes, we will need quite a few developers, and therefore money.",1355187034

The common characteristic of NP-complete problems is that there are an exponential number of possible solutions, but verifying that a purported solution is a solution takes only polynomial time.<p>For example consider SAT (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem</a> for more).  This is the problem of deciding whether there is a set of possible variable values that make a given Boolean equation evaluate to <i>True</i>.  For an equation of length n there are in general O(n) variables, and therefore 2^O(n) possible sets of true/false values that the variables can have.  So a brute force search takes exponential time.<p>But if you give me an equation, AND a set of values for the variables that you claim will result in the final expression evaluating to <i>True</i>, I can verify it in time O(n).<p>Does that answer your question?",1355186352

Perhaps this is a good example of how more hardware resources can lead to them being wasted - the fact that RAM has grown so much that <i>most</i> images fit completely in it, has also meant programmers assuming they can do this for <i>all</i> images without a second thought when often all that&#x27;s needed is a tiny subset of all the data.<p>Even if the image data is compressed, there&#x27;s absolutely no need to keep all of it in memory - just decompress incrementally into a small, fixed-size buffer until you get to the &quot;plaintext&quot; position desired, ignoring everything before that. The fact that it&#x27;s compressed also means that, with suitable algorithms, you can skip over huge spans at once - this is particularly easy to do with RLE and LZ - and the compression ratio actually boosts the speed of seeking to a specific position.<p>Currently, (hopefully...) no application is attempting to read entire video files into memory before processing them, but I wonder if that might change in the future as RAM becomes even bigger, and we&#x27;ll start to get &quot;video decompression bombs&quot; instead?",1441202328

10159142,comment,10149735,10152612,0,0,talmand,,,"Simple. Most of the deals Netflix have in place have terms dictated by the content creators. Well, maybe content owner is a better term. There are also the deals that Netflix passes on because they feel the terms required by the content owners are too much.<p>In the end, content owners get the final say in whether their content appears on Netflix or not. They either say no because they don&#x27;t like Netflix, they say no because they got a better deal elsewhere, or Netflix says no because the terms are not financially viable. Which is one reason for Netflix to &quot;dump&quot; a huge movie library, which they have before.

Rats aren&#x27;t humans, of course, but we think they share important characteristics with humans. Of course, human trials would be better---butbecause there are ethical and practical difficulties in performing human experiments in controlled environments, we are happy to accept the insights that come from studying rats.<p>Theoretical economics studies the interactions of idealized &#x27;rational&#x27; actors. These aren&#x27;t humans, of course, but like rats, we think they might share important characteristics with humans. Like rational actors, humans have things they want, and do respond to incentives. Economics is largely the study of systems of incentives.<p>You can gain insight into the systems of rational actors---and insofar as you believe the analogy between rational actors and humans, into human economic systems---by writing equations and proving theorems.<p>I&#x27;m sick of this theme that theoretical economists are these dogmatic lunatics who write equations on the board that have nothing to do with reality. They are in the business of crafting powerful arguments about human nature by analogy, which yes, aren&#x27;t always accessible to those of us who haven&#x27;t steeped ourselves in the math, but I think that is no reason to dismiss their insights as nonsense and saying they have a &#x27;math problem&#x27;.",1441202244

10159115,comment,10157418,10157866,0,0,bradfordarner,,,"I would have to disagree with the other responses to this question. However, I cannot disagree completely. Learning Erlang/Elixir is a subject full of nuance.<p>Learning the procedural aspects of Erlang or Elixir is very easy. In that sense I agree with the previous responses. Erlang gets a lot of bad rap for the syntax. But, it is really no more difficult that any other language to learn. The syntax can easily be learned in a day. Elixir&#x27;s syntax can be learned even more quickly because it looks a lot like Ruby or Python. Thus, you can certainly start write scripts in Erlang or Elixir relatively quickly. My guess is that the average, experienced developer could start writing basic scripts in an hour or two. However, those scripts would be entirely procedural in nature, unless they are already very familiar with functional programming and pattern matching.<p>The first hurdle in Erlang/Elixir is the functional aspects of the language and understanding the power of pattern matching. Both of these require rethinking how you build a program. But, both of these are also incredibly, incredibly worthwhile and powerful. Elixir in particular is a great medium for better understanding these concepts because it is a very approachable language. Getting over this hurdle did not happen over night for me. I rarely used recursion in Ruby or Javascript (there is no tail call optimization). On the other hand, in functional languages recursive functions are the norm. I learned to really love them with Erlang/Elixir and now it frustrates me when I can&#x27;t use them elsewhere because it has become much easier for me to reason about recursive functions than loops. Overall, functional programming and pattern matching are amazing things to learn but really grokking them won&#x27;t happen over night.<p>The next hurdle with Erlang/Elixir is understanding OTP. This is THE incredibly powerful aspect of the Erlang VM. However, it is also not an easy subject matter to approach unless you already have a strong background in distributed systems. I did not. Hence, it took me a while to compose programs that actually used the Erlang VM for what it was built for, OTP. Thus, this portion of the Erlang/Elixir learning curve felt long and slow. I was not used to spawning new processes on a whim and passing messages back and forth. Initially I would send messages only one way without realizing that the appropriate pattern is to view it in a standard server-client relationship where there should always be a request and a response. Eventually I started viewing all the little applications running inside my larger program as self-contained capsules/servers that communicated among each other. However, it took me weeks of really intense study to get comfortable with. But, once you get comfortable with OTP you have a lot of built-in power (people rarely mention Mnesia, DTS, ETS gen_server but they are awesome).<p>Overall, my experience with Erlang/Elixir has shown me one big thing: pick the best tool for the job and there are a lot of jobs that you don&#x27;t need OTP for. When you need to build Whatsapp, you should pick Erlang/Elixir. When you want to build a simple web app that only has a couple of end points and much of the dynamism is handled on the front-end, use Go, Node, or my personal favorite Clojure. Erlang/Elixir shine in the context for which they were built. But, they are not built for everything. And, if you only want the procedural aspects of the languages, there is no reason to choose them over Go, Node, Clojure, or Scala...all of which have solid approaches to concurrency.",1441202044

He wrote an excellent account of his time training spies in Britain then leading resistance movements in Vichy France. His book is titled &quot;The O.S.S. And I&quot; and his name was William Morgan.<p>I consider it an essential read for understanding group dynamics in unfamiliar territories. People tend to act in archetypes when put in controlled situations. For example, one of the training/vetting challenges was to cross a pool of water without touching it using supplies scattered around the site. It took three planks to do it properly, although two would work if you were extremely slow and careful. One plank was easy to find, one was hard, the third was extremely well-hidden. You can see from that example who will examine all of the options and who will get frustrated with 2/3 of the supplies and try to wing it.<p>Another interesting facet he brought up was how different tests could show aptitude in different people.  For example, Polish recruits tended to be poor at individual tests but they excelled as a team because they were far less prone to bickering over who gets to lead.<p>I consider &quot;The O.S.S. And I&quot; to be a better guide to management than most white collar crap we see these days.

S&P 500, FTSE 250 (but not the FTSE 100 - not nearly diverse enough for my liking) and so on. I&#x27;ve got about three times my annual income currently invested; it&#x27;s about 75% indices, and 25% individual companies, and two lumps of gold that I&#x27;ve lost somewhere in my house.<p>I don&#x27;t specifically go researching much in the way of individual stock picks. I don&#x27;t set my criteria and then go looking for companies that meet that criteria; I keep an eye on the news and trends and so forth, and build confidence that a sector (or sometimes a specific company, but that&#x27;s rare) will do well.<p>Some examples; when the UK government made it clear that they will do anything to prop up the UK housebuilding companies (which to my mind was when they started underwriting people&#x27;s mortgages with the &quot;help to buy&quot; scheme) I piled into UK housebuilders, and they&#x27;ve done very well.<p>When I found myself noticing that the dollar seemed awfully cheap a year or so ago, I looked for reasons why (and where it might go next) and I altered my balance of index funds to buy into the US some more (which worked out pretty well).<p>When Nokia started getting grudging good reviews for their phones, I looked into what else they were up to and bought into Nokia right before Microsoft bought their handset business.<p>It hasn&#x27;t all been good; I bought into ARM and IMG, hoping to ride the spread of mobile phones, and while ARM came in like a Viking, I made a loss on IMG (although the gains on ARM far outweighed the loss on IMG). A couple of UK retailers have been very disappointing (although still better than just cash in a bank).<p>I rarely sell. I bought into BP some time after their big spill, anticipating that the run of bad news would slow and they&#x27;d start to recover. As it was, the run of bad news went on and on and on and it looked like they&#x27;d be dealing with it for years. Sold up, put it into a US railroad company (which came on like a viking - another pick based on the idea that as the economy recovered, there would be a renewed global interest in new railroad technology; I picked the sector first, and then went looking for good companies in that sector).",1441201190

For better (buyer market) or worse (seller market) negotiation is open till the very end when both parties have maximum information.<p>I have seen friends struggling in similar seller market in more &quot;civilised&quot; countries. They had less risk of gazumping, but the risk of betting blind is very real.<p>As for the lease holding, there is no simple &quot;flat ownership&quot; as it is part of a building and that means shared responsibilities on the common and weirdo syndic / condominium / association of owners.

10158902,comment,10157244,10157244,0,0,oconnor663,,,"> Because Go gives us interfaces and closures we can write much more elegant, generic APIs with a flavor similar to Ruby or Lisp and this is the direction the language naturally wants us to take. Personally I like to use the empty interface for plumbing and only pin things down to specific interfaces or concrete types where I need to for performance or correctness.<p>That&#x27;s a lot like using opaque pointers in C. What is it about Go that makes people assume it&#x27;s shortcomings are beautiful designs?<p>I learned yesterday that `x == nil` can return false <i>even if x is nil</i> so long as x is an interface type. But it depends on whether x is <i>actually</i> nil or a nil value with a specific type.<p>(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻<p>My other pet peeve is that a method with a non-pointer receiver that tries to modify the receiver object will silently drop those modifications on the ground, because the object is copied. Which makes some sense, except that Go likes to convert to pointer receivers automatically, so the caller can&#x27;t tell that anything is wrong. The only difference is one character in the method definition. Everyone I know hits this bug at some point and loses half an hour before they learn to look for it. You could almost say &quot;all method receivers must be pointers&quot; except that you need to refer to interface types without the pointer.<p>(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻",1441199392

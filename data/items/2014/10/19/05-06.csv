8477349,comment,8475809,8476972,0,0,avmich,,,"One reason for one-character names is the habit of these languages to sidestep naming problem. Naming things is one of the hardest problems in software. APL programs are ideally read as &quot;variable X is ...&quot;, not &quot;do this, then this, then this&quot; - so appropriate names of variables could be something like &quot;max of reduce by difference...&quot; - hence the hardness of coming with good names.<p>Another reason is the same as in math. When you write equations on a whiteboard - the long-sought golden standard of expressiveness - you don&#x27;t use long names - at best you encode names with subscripts, indexes etc. But names themselves are usually pretty short. APL languages use the same rationale.<p>Just like you need to read carefully every line of a math equation to understand what&#x27;s going on, you have to read carefully each symbol of programs in APL family languages. It&#x27;s unusual for programmers who got used to more help along the line - but the vocabulary of all such languages is quite short and doesn&#x27;t extend that often. Another reason why APL could be used for teaching math.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that this style of naming is not good for anything. Somehow majority of programmers in these languages agree with that. Regarding much more useful things -<p>&quot;If you are interested in programming solutions to challenging data processing problems, then the time you invest in learning J will be well spent.&quot; (<a href=""http://jsoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsoftware.com/</a>)",1413698279

They were both pursuing a goal that we now know is both impossible and uninteresting: turning base metals into gold in the case of alchemists, and certain propositions in the case of philosophers.<p>As a scientist who has studied philosophy seriously, I am comfortable saying this is generally true of everything philosophers do: it is based on a fundamentally mistaken approach to understanding the world that vastly over-states the role of introspection, the fidelity of the senses, common-sense, memory, and the human perspective. The arts are an appropriate place for such explorations, and they should be understood as what they are: studies of human experience, and nothing else. They can&#x27;t teach us anything about the way the world actually is, or what are the optimal principles to govern our behaviour, or any of the other things that philosophers claim to this day is their unique subject of study. There is a role for natural philosophy as the foundations of science, but the rest? Un-natural philosophy has neither place nor use, and Einstein&#x27;s modest affection for Spinoza was almost completely irrelevant to this actual science.<p>Philosophers have been trying to claim &quot;inspiration&quot; for the work of scientists for centuries (there used to be a significant contingent of Aristotelians who claimed Newton was inspired by Aristotle, which is almost completely without empirical basis.) It&#x27;s kind of sad, seeing a several thousand year exercise in wrong-headedness finally meet its inevitable end, and of course there will be a few who insist on soldiering blindly on, arbitrarily privileging the human scale and human senses, blissfully unaware they are spouting gibberish, while the rest of us feel rather sad for them, and try to keep them away from sharp objects and the reins of power.",1413697489

Not trying to antagonize but I can&#x27;t see any harm in having a row of booths with terminals that patients can log into and start answering questions about symptoms, being led through the &quot;troubleshooting&quot; steps, etc. There&#x27;s a lot of time spent just waiting around in hospitals, waiting rooms, etc. Maybe you could have a swipe card that saves your progress on the terminal, combines it with the lab results. The system wouldn&#x27;t replace a GP just yet but it would instead work alongside the GP.<p>2) Are there any crowd-sourced solutions available yet for these cases where doctors clearly have no idea? Someone enters all their symptoms and people discuss online and try to come up with some possible options.<p>3) How much are insurance companies responsible for the sorry state of health care in the US? I was speaking to my friend who says that he pays $850 bucks a month (up from $800 a month last year) on top of what his company pays. I&#x27;ve heard other stories about people basically being a slave to their company because they can&#x27;t leave due to the generous benefits. I&#x27;ve also heard that insurance companies pay back only 60 cents in the dollar, so to make up the same $100 a doctor was previously earning he now has to charge about $170 (the other option is to be cut from the network of doctors used by the insurance company). And is this the logical conclusion for health care? Will Canada/Australia head the same direction? Seriously, there is a massive opportunity for the US to fix some of these problems now, yet it just seems that you guys are heading in entirely the opposite direction.",1413696989

They actually <i>are</i> the minority, and the complainy and hateful ones even moreso. On one side, a bunch of angry trolls; on the other side, everyone looking to maintain credibility in the gaming media and media at large is arrayed against them.<p>The grumpy gamers are, actually, the minority.<p>For a lot of us growing up in the 80s and 90s, to be a gamer was not something cool or hip. For a lot of us, learning to use memmaker and autoexec.bat and config.sys and weird incantations to run Quake or Doom on our shitty 3.11 boxen was not something we were respected or lauded for.<p>Many times, you were met with &quot;Video games? huh.&quot;. Mostly, you were met with minor teasing for being a geek, or nerding out about video games, or whatever. In some cases, you were met with outright suspicion or hostility--being a Doom or Quake modder following Columbine was not something that made friends with fellow students or administrators (or parents!) for a while. Let&#x27;s not even go into the shitty gender dynamic here for gamers, or how it usually affected social skills and romance and all that stuff...that&#x27;s just unfair to play as a card.<p>In the mainstream coverage, nobody seems to be pointing this out. Nobody seems to be pointing out that, following that period in the 90s, there was a massive push (not seen since the early 80s) for AAA games with even further juvenile masculine power fantasies in the advertising. Nobody notes that, concurrent with that push, there was a strong sort of societal disdain for gamers, for Counter-Strike players, for these folks continually portrayed as manchildren. Playing Asheron&#x27;s Call or Everquest or Ultima Online or RO or WoW didn&#x27;t do <i>shit</i> for you socially.<p>But, now that it&#x27;s convenient for some people&#x27;s careers (for whatever reason), suddenly we portray gamers as this super privileged class. Suddenly gamers are this oppressing majority, this totally reasonable target for our scorn and hatred.<p>And so now, just as happened before, we mock them, we jeer at them, we call them dirty names and pan them in the press and make fun of these kids who just want to escape into a fantasy world for a little bit and fuck around.<p>And then, we act so fucking surprised that some lash back, make threats, act like buffoons...while the rest just wish we&#x27;d leave them alone, so they can go back to playing games.",1413696751

But would you have respected Zuck as much if he&#x27;d sold Facebook to Yahoo?<p>Either way, Facebook controls the industry now, and there are few industries that have grown to their full potential under the stewardship of a company that acquired the primary creator.  Take automobiles, for example.  Ford started his own company.  He didn&#x27;t start his own company and then sell it.  Automobiles would certainly have done well even if he had, since transportation is a fundamental technology, but VR goggles aren&#x27;t.  How long will their development be delayed because Oculus no longer feels the pressure of getting their company off the ground?  People keep talking like &quot;they now have the resources they need to make Oculus great,&quot; but if history is any indication, having excessive resources tends to produce excessive failure, not success.  For example, companies that take huge investment rounds usually fail to deliver something of value to customers.  Maybe Oculus is in the same position. After all, if they don&#x27;t deliver something people want, then there&#x27;s no downside anymore for Oculus.  They&#x27;ve already been bought by Facebook.   They could fail to do anything from this point forward and it would no longer matter to them (except emotionally).<p>Breathless hero worship is a little over the top, considering the outcome.

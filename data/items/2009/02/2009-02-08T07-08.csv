472007,comment,471660,471848,0,0,GHFigs,,,"You can believe in or participate in something without having it form a significant part of your identity.  Usually we say something like that is a ""preference"" or ""opinion"", but the difference in name is only a an indicator that it is less coupled to our identity than that it is a distinctly different kind of thing.<p><i>It's true, people who don't believe in anything don't argue about religion and politics, they fight over fashion and celebrities.</i><p>This is an excessive generalization, and a false dichotomy.  The people who argue over fashion or celebrity are those who have incorporated it into their identity.  Those subjects are distinct from religion in politics by a matter of degree, not category.<p>A typical person responds very differently to having their religion criticized than they do having their favorite flavor of ice cream criticized, even though objectively speaking they are both just preferences among a wide number of choices.  It isn't even necessarily true that they've given more thought to the former than the latter, only that they identify with that preference much more closely--and criticism of it feels that much more like criticism of the individual.",1234079856

There needs to be some kind of happy medium between rigor and usability.  That middle point hasn't occurred to me yet.<p>Perhaps just some kind of reference system, so when an old debate reemerges, people can just refer to the online record until new ground is broken.

When someone tries to defend a shoddy point by saying 'it's so because I know it,' we call them a fool. We only allow this defense in the name of 'faith.'",1234079416

It may demand effort from you, but not so much of introspection and self-examination, which is often frightening and tiring. And to avoid identification resists the following of role models, to a large extent one must walk their paths alone. Lastly, one is then impeded in finding those of like mind and affinity.

She had a full-time job at a large company doing quality assurance testing (finding bugs), so she offered him the opportunity of leaving his full-time job while she paid the bills.  Just a couple months after he did that, the recession hit, and she was laid off.

I have seen people who oppose the kyoto treaty because they were employed at a coal-fired power plant, but these are exceptions.<p>If you believe the thesis that social issues such as flag burning and gay marriage lead poor voters to vote against their material interests then you have another case where identity trumps impact, at least in voting decisions.",1234077489

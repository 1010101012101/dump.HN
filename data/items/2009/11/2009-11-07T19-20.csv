Normal config is F1-F10, plus esc, ctrl, user, fn, and enter.  The driver allowed you to customize it for apps such as AutoCAD.  Typical mechanical ball mouse guts, DE-9 serial connector.  Actually pretty high quality, as you'd expect for a CAD peripheral back in the day.<p>Couldn't find an images online (I could take one if anyone is really interested), but I did see that someone was trying to reverse engineer the protocol:

928210,comment,927846,928035,0,0,rauljara,,,"No, the fact that IQ can change does not prove that it can be intentionally changed.  Head start, the increases in IQ that African Americans experienced when they moved out the segregated South, the Flynn effect, etc. also do not definitively prove that IQ can be intentionally changed.  All they do is strongly suggest it.  However, I have yet to see any evidence that would strongly suggest that IQ is impervious to change that is anywhere near as convincing as the above.  Even identical twin studies (which have inherent problems with them) suggest that a large percentage of IQ is determined by the environment.  Definitive proof is very hard to come by when it comes to human behavior.  Just because something has not been definitively proved does not mean it is wrong.",1257622478

In fact, both scheme and python are multi-paradigm languages, where both support functional (lambda calculus), object-orientation and imperative statements. If you want to focus on learning your computer, in a von Neuman way, then C is perfect. C++ is a dead horse, that should be left alone. But with scheme, you can focus 100% on algorithm development. That is not true with C/C++, which strictly speaking requires extreme caution with regard to manual memory management. Python is fun too, but has mainly gained more momentum than scheme because it has a more pragmatic focus on building and maintaining libraries with backward comp.. If the God of scheme manages to summon their rXrs camps into one 'multi-cultural' one - then we can expect scheme to mainstream adoption.",1257621412

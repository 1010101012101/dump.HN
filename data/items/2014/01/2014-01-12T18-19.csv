This does not work. As soon as you are fully submerged and displacing with bladders you are unstable. As your depth increases, pressure increases, and your displacement goes down making you sink even faster. The good news is if you get neutrally buoyant you could poke the blocks down into place and they wouldn&#x27;t weight much so you could move them around then remove the bladders.<p>Also not covered was how the water gets to the top. Each lock load of blocks and bladders requires at minimum the same mass of water to be lowered (to fill the lower lock chamber). In practice it will be at least several times this in order to keep the blocks from jamming in the chamber. So each ton of block effortlessly floated to the top will take several to many tons of water laboriously hauled to the top. Hauling water is probably lower friction than stone, compared to the volume multiplier, I can&#x27;t say who wins.<p>The inner lower lock door is also a problem. It has to contain water at something like 10 atmospheres and be loose enough to move. Plus, if shaped like the video, it needs to weigh 150lbs/in^2 to keep from being blown out when raised. That makes it about 120 feet tall if made from limestone.",1389552528

For me, this is one of the biggest advantages to going the open source route.  There are, of course, downsides to not having a company backing your tools, but they can be balanced against the community associated with the your language of choice.<p>There&#x27;s also the build/test/deployment cycle when developing, which pudquick touched on indirectly.  With scripting languages, deploying a new build to test is usually as simple as saving and restarting the process.  Sometimes you don&#x27;t have to go past saving.  The last time I dealt with C# and languages in that space (C/Java/ etc..) a build cycle involved a compiling a potentially several more steps.  If you&#x27;ve worked with languages that don&#x27;t require that, having to use one that does can get annoying pretty quickly.  Especially if the project is of any size.<p>Another big point is the availability of libraries to do things you want to do.  Most of the open source language platforms have large repositories of libraries that you can pull into your project with ease (pip, rubygems, cpan, pear, clojars, etc ...) and management tools (gem, bundler, cpan, perl-lib, composer, leiningen, pip, etc ...) to simplify installing/using those libraries.<p>One other thing, and this is one I see as absolutely huge, python, ruby, php, etc encourage pull people into a larger community if you get beyond anything trivial.  This exposes a developer to other languages, other platforms, and other ways of looking at software.  Of course, that means the developer has to go looking as well.<p>Still, there are four (non-comprehensive) big reasons to use any language:<p>* It pays the bills<p>* Its a good technical choice for the &quot;job&quot;/project<p>* You like working with it<p>* You have to maintain someone else&#x27;s toys",1389552052

This is where a very bad contradiction in python&#x27;s zen appears: staying readable.

7046895,comment,7046313,7046313,10,0,randomdrake,,,"Thanks for your contribution! Always love seeing new attempts with PHP. While I 100% appreciate your efforts, there are a few really big questions or problems I have with the way this has been presented. As a PHP developer, I hope you don&#x27;t mind me addressing them here.<p>1) You benchmarked a large framework with all sorts of features and functionality against a very specific library with a few files. What about all of the extra pieces from Symfony? What do those files bring to the table or don&#x27;t they? Did you only test routing features? If so, how? Are all of the features from that Symfony package available in Pux?<p>2) The title of the graphs showing the hockey stick effect you were undoubtedly looking for is:\n    ab -n 1000 -c 10<p>The graphs seem to go to 2000. In looking at your test files in your repo, we see the following:\n    ab -g out.dat -n 2000 -c 10 <a href=""http://localhost/work/php/symfony-routing-example/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/work/php/symfony-routing-example/index.php</a><p>When creating benchmarks, accuracy and transparency is an absolute must. That aside: looking at the graphs, it&#x27;s clear there isn&#x27;t much of a difference at the 1000 level. Boosting that to 2000 appears to have had your desired effect. But what&#x27;s the reason for it and why does it change?<p>Also, a concurrency of 10? Why 10? What about 1? 50? 100? 1000? Does it never fail? Does it only work well around 10 concurrent users?<p><i>Making massive claims requires massive evidence.</i><p>3) You&#x27;re comparing apples to oranges here. To get to the point you&#x27;re at in your test, requires a user to install an extension <i>and</i> run a file on the server to compile the routes, every time the routes change. Symfony doesn&#x27;t require this.<p>&quot;Pux tries not to consume computation time to build all routes dynamically (like Symfony/Routing). Instead, Pux compiles your routes to plain PHP array for caching, the compiled routes can be loaded from cache very fast.&quot;<p>To get the performance you&#x27;re wanting, no, Pux doesn&#x27;t do it dynamically. Which, makes sense because it&#x27;s <i>writing a flat file to disk and calling it &quot;compiling&quot; or &quot;caching&quot;</i> when it really isn&#x27;t either in the traditional sense. You can tell it to write a file to disk of the rendered routes, but it must be manually told to do so; unless I&#x27;m missing something in the code, it does not happen automatically. Without reading in the file to check for differences, it couldn&#x27;t. The performance would almost certainly degrade.<p>Moving bottleneck concerns to a different layer of the application and then specifically benchmarking against that is almost certainly going to give you the benchmarks you&#x27;re looking for. Since you have moved your concerns to your disk, you now run into all sorts of problems that come along with such a philosophy. How do you ensure the same file is split across multiple servers? Who has access to run the script necessary to create the file? What happens if the application grows so big that the file can&#x27;t reasonably fit into memory? What happens when disk reading and writing becomes too expensive? Y&#x27;know, the regular questions that crop up when you start to move performance concerns to disk.<p>This would be much more accurate, and in my opinion interesting, if it left off the comparison to Symfony completely, stopped using words like &quot;compile&quot; and &quot;cache,&quot; and instead described it by saying what it <i>actually</i> does:<p>Pux is a library with an extension for fast tokenization and rendering of strings for application routing and a set of files to allow the option of writing those renderings to disk instead of having them executed at runtime.",1389551855

It is widely known in behavioral economics that framing effects can have a huge effect on the way people respond ([1] [2], and so on), so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised than the way you ask people to evaluate their own happiness could explain at least part of the difference.<p>One of the conclusions of the Easterlin Paradox is that people care more about how much they earn compared to their neighbors than the actual amount. I feel like asking the question this way (imagining their happiness as a ladder with 10 steps, then thinking about their income) would directly lead to people implicitly internalizing this comparison in some kind of mental model where higher wealth = more happiness because they&#x27;re trying to imagine what the best life possible could be: &quot;ah I&#x27;m pretty happy right now, but if I had a twice as much money I think I would be happier though, so surely I can&#x27;t be at the last step at the ladder. Actually, people who have twice as much than that should be even happier, so I&#x27;ll add some steps on top and say I&#x27;m a 6 right now&quot;.<p>This sounds plausible to me because while the authors conclude there is no saturation point where income doesn&#x27;t bring more happiness, this is a scale from 1 to 10 so surely some people must rate themselves a 10. What would those who earn twice as much as them think then? This solution could be that &quot;being on top of the ladder&quot; in people&#x27;s mind is somehow conflated with &quot;being on top of the income distribution&quot;, with all the other levels being computed relatively to that. In other terms, this framing may incite people to evaluate their happiness on a cross-sectional level, with Easterlin&#x27;s Paradox being precisely that the income-happiness relationship exists only at the cross-sectional level but not at the longitudinal level.<p>The debate between the two models (Easterlin vs. Stevenson and Wolfers) has been a longstanding debate in happiness economics, with both sides having confirmed their findings with multiple data sets [3]. Maybe they&#x27;re both right in a sense and the answer just depends on which definition of happiness you&#x27;re asking people to evaluate themselves with (relative vs. on an absolute level)?<p>[1] <a href=""http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/the_framing_eff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/the...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.adsavvy.org/the-power-of-framing-effects-and-other-cognitive-biases/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adsavvy.org/the-power-of-framing-effects-and-othe...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easterlin_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easterlin_paradox</a>",1389551693

I&#x27;d say, from personal experience of myself, friends, and Okcupid&#x27;s old blog posts, that these algo&#x27;s do a piss poor job [1]. Not because the algo is bad, but because the person at the top is a capitalist. Their job is to maximize profits, not to get people together. Additionally, people are not honest in their profiles. So you get a case of &#x27;shit in, shit out&#x27; for the algos. Also, men in particular, are blind to anything but the face[2]. Still, more and more people are meeting online and staying together. In fact, the divorce rates seem to be lower for online meetings[3], 6% vs. 8% for traditional meetings.<p>Ok, stats and anecdotes aside, this is straight creepy to me. I agree with you, it seems that the programmer is becoming the only real job left. If some dating algo can do a better job than yourself ever could, the only logical choice is to use that algo. But, dammit, its so freaking sterile to me! Yeah, I am old fashioned here, but having a computer say that I am a better match and will have, statistically, a better life with $person is terrible. I have no control of my life then! This person that I might have children with was not chosen by me. Rather, I chose \nto reject the algo or roll the dice again.<p>A recent video produced by &quot;A studio on Fuxing Road&quot; contrasts the Brittish, US, and Chinese election systems[4]. The piece is very pro communist. It glorifies the system of paperwork that insures good governance of China and says this is cheaper and better than the way the US does it. To me, it&#x27;s bullshit. Even if the &#x27;algo&#x27; they used worked and was not corrupt, hell, even if it worked better than democracy, it&#x27;s still Bullshit. I have a right to say to whom I give my consent to govern me. Everyone has that right. Even if the &#x27;algo&#x27; get better than I can ever be, I have to give consent explicitly. I have to know and be informed. I can&#x27;t stand just rolling over to have the &#x27;algos&#x27; determine my fate for me. I can see where it is better for society and for the planet that the algos get the control and we just ride along. But I really don&#x27;t want that.<p>Sorry, that derailed there. But I hope you see where I was going. I, too, fear that the programmer, in their data driven wisdom, will step too far.<p>[1]Unfortunately, offline now: <a href=""http://contently.com/strategist/2013/08/19/whatever-happened-to-okcupids-oktrends-spoiler-alert-its-coming-back/#!r1LMZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://contently.com/strategist/2013/08/19/whatever-happened...</a> \n[2]<a href=""http://www.cracked.com/blog/4-things-i-learned-from-worst-online-dating-profile-ever/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cracked.com/blog/4-things-i-learned-from-worst-on...</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/05/31/1222447110"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/05/31/1222447110</a>\n[4]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M734o_17H_A"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M734o_17H_A</a>",1389551661

If you have a table of numbers you <i>can</i> compare them by looking at all the cells or you can graph each row one a cartesian (or polar or...) plot.  Both contain the same info, and the table probably has higher resolution, but which tells a more illuminating story?<p>On a watch face, the minute hand is the biggest win: you can see at a glance approximately what time it is / approximately how long you have / approximately how far away you are which is what you usually need.  I definitely think in terms of it being about &quot;a quarter past fourteen&quot; or &quot;half past seven&quot;.  The digital watch has too much precision and requires too much parsing.<p>The hour hand gives you similar data on a larger scale, but you typically need that less.  And in fact though the watch face shows 2x 12 hours, when I look at it I see the normal 24 hour clock.<p>The second hand is good when you&#x27;re working out since as you see it sweep to its goal you might push harder to get one more rep in or whatever, but this is a less common need and in fact many analogue watches come without a second hand.<p>===<p>The analogue clock face is an example of more humane design for specific problem domain, sort of the like US & Imperial unit systems.  They are utterly useless for engineering (but even in engineering I use both MKS and CGS depending on the problem domain -- and its community).  Miles and km / acres and hectares -- it&#x27;s no big deal to me either way.  But when making a staircase, cooking a meal for three people or resizing a dress pattern, the ability to use a system that naturally decomposes into rational factors is appropriate.

This style of development works very well for me. There are other languages where you can do development like this but (and please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the way that people write code in C#.<p>Secondly, with Python, the most popular implementation of the language is supported on all the main platforms.

Microsoft seem to have done a pretty good job of updating the language over the years to support stuff like generics and functional programming. They&#x27;ve certainly done a better job on this front than Sun/Oracle have done with Java.

Python also recieves much praise for being easy to learn, readability, productivity, expressiveness, and its library support, namely NumPy and SciPy (Python is often used in scientific computing for this very reason). Aside from this, Python programmers like it and that&#x27;s reason enough. Performance for Python (and Ruby) is adequate for most use cases.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t like Python. If I want a dynamically typed language, I use Ruby, but I came to this conclusion after spending  time with both languages, and it wasn&#x27;t the feature set that sold me of one over the other, but rather how I felt while working in the language and its ecosystem. In other words, whether or not Python or Ruby are worth your time is a decision you&#x27;ll only be able to make after using the language.<p>I believe in being language agnostic whenever possible. Don&#x27;t hold strong opinions about languages. People invest a lot of time and energy into their tools. This is a &quot;sunk cost.&quot; Their time and energy can&#x27;t be reclaimed. So it&#x27;s no surprise that, when asked, they will praise their tools -- even if they aren&#x27;t objectively all that great -- solely to justify the costs. They aren&#x27;t trying to convince you, they&#x27;re trying to convince themselves. So don&#x27;t waste time trying to find feature comparisons. All languages have redeemable values, and learning a new one is always a valuable exercise.<p>So give Python and Ruby a shot. You might find you actually like them, but not for the reasons you expected to. And if you don&#x27;t like them, at least you&#x27;ll know why.",1389550630

But there are two points about this:<p>- How effective is this? If installing cameras all over the city of London stopped one person from being mugged, is it worth it?<p>The big issue with trying to measure this is two-fold. Firstly, the notion of &quot;stopped&quot; is a  bit hard to measure. Obviously, the number of people caught thanks to evidence on the cameras counts, but if there were eyewitnesses as well, does it still count? Inversely, what about the chilling effect brought on by the cameras? How do you count the number of people who don&#x27;t even think about mugging thanks to the cameras? And who&#x27;s to say that the crime isn&#x27;t simply displaced? Society is pretty bad at figuring out general supply demand curves (an example: We would think that raising wages would entice people to work more, but a decent amount of arguments exist to say that after a certain wage level, increasing the wage would decrease the number of hours we work (substitution effect with leisure) (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_bending_supply_curve_of_labour)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_bending_supply_curve_o...</a>)<p>-How do we measure effectiveness? I get mugged and lose a $200 phone. I think I would be slightly irked by it, and quantifying this as merely a $200 loss might insult me (especially considering I&#x27;m not very used to being mugged and I would consider it a traumatic experience).<p>A terrorist attack has a similar quantification problem, there are widespread psychological effects (even just the loss of loved ones, beyond the macro &quot;security theater&quot; stuff which induces circular reasoning).

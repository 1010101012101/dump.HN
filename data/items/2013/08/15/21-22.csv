It&#x27;s not a &quot;fallback to a crappy RNG&quot;. Random and urandom are two different interfaces to the same CSPRNG engine. One of them happens to block based on entropy estimates, but that&#x27;s a design weakness of the Linux CSPRNG, not a great feature of a CSPRNG in general.<p>While considering how highly rated my comment was, and weighing your own expertise on cryptographic randomness, you might also consider reading the NaCL design paper (Bernstein, Lange, Schwabe) for more details on why you want to use the OS CSPRNG instead of your own. Or, for that matter, consult the NaCL source code to see which they use.<p>Finally, to your main point: the reason you should use the OS CSPRNG (typically: urandom) is precisely so that you <i>don&#x27;t</i> end up using some random bit of aspirational app crypto.

Back in the day, the Linux implementation of Flash didn&#x27;t support making the Flash embed transparent, so I had to go into Firebug/Web Inspector and delete the embed/object tags entirely just to read the page. While I think that particular bug has been fixed, even today, most of the Chrome tab crashes I run into are still caused by Flash crashing.<p>It really bothers me how much stuff depends on Flash still, whether it&#x27;s putting something in the clipboard from the browser, or just Google Hangouts or Facebook deciding to play a &quot;ping!&quot; when a notification goes off.<p>The only thing &quot;HTML5&quot; means to me is that my ARM devices can offload H.264 video decoding to the GPU, rather than trying to run a cross-compiled Sorenson decoder on the (relatively underpowered) CPU. Everything else under the &quot;HTML5&quot; banner seems to be just increasingly complicated browser-specific extensions to JavaScript and/or CSS.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed that the Chromebook and Chrome for Android will deallocate tabs that I haven&#x27;t used recently and reload them when I switch to them, which lets me have dozens of tabs &quot;open&quot; on devices which are otherwise only capable of handling three or four tabs at once. Of course, this is only reasonable because of &quot;high speed internet&quot;; I remember being on dial-up in the late 90s running Internet Explorer 4 and opening ten windows in the background so that the pages would pre-load in the background while I read the current page.",1376603204

There are plenty of opportunities to contribute to OSS in the context of proprietary software. Even if you write proprietary software, you most likely <i>use</i> open source software (I know that&#x27;s not true of everyone-- more on that below). And when you use it a lot, you find bugs or missing features, which <i>you can fix</i> as part of your job. When I was less experienced and there was no Github, I shrugged my shoulders and worked around problems I found, which usually just led to more pain. Now, I grok the code and make a pull request. It helps the proprietary project I&#x27;m working on and helps, almost incidentally, all of the other users. And ultimately, I suspect that&#x27;s where a huge portion of OSS code comes from: people who need it and are thus willing to contribute as part of their proprietary software jobs, not from dedicated OSS developers volunteering their time, forgoing sanity and a paycheck. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so much good OSS infrastructure software.<p>With that in mind, let&#x27;s imagine a manager hiring engineers for a project built on top of an OSS stack. Sometimes that stuff won&#x27;t work right, and sometimes--I&#x27;d argue usually--the right answer is to just fix it. And you&#x27;re looking at a developer with experience doing just that and someone who hasn&#x27;t. One has taken the initiative to learn their way around the internals of the tools they use and the other may or may not have. Who do you pick? Contributing to OSS is not just a badge of honor here; it&#x27;s what&#x27;s left behind by good development work.<p>Sure, some jobs don&#x27;t have that. Maybe it&#x27;s a video game built on some proprietary toolkit, maybe it&#x27;s a low-level library written from scratch.

Obvious caveat: this is just my personal opinion.<p>> With this backdrop, we temporarily took down our full-featured app when Google objected to it last May<p>If I remember right, this full-featured app included features like:<p>1. Allowing users to download videos even when the content provider disallowed that.<p>2. Allowing users to not view ads even when the content provider specifically required ads to be shown.<p>3. Using YouTube&#x27;s branding without permission.<p>I am but a lowly engineer and the actions of executives confuse me, but I don&#x27;t see how Microsoft didn&#x27;t realize the above was batshit crazy. I can only assume this is some sort of weird ploy.<p>YouTube&#x27;s entire business model is about getting content providers to put videos up there so that people will watch ads to see them. If you let people take videos off the site, or just skip the ads, that breaks the fundamental business proposition.<p>This would be like me making an Android app called &quot;Bing from Micrsoft&quot; that let you perform bing searches but then stripped out all of the ads. Microsoft would shut that shit down, with good reason.<p>> When we first built a YouTube app for Windows Phone, we did so with the understanding that Google claimed to grow its business based on open access to its platforms and content, a point it reiterated last year.<p>&quot;Open access to content&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;ignore the requirements of the people who created that content&quot;. People make their livelihoods producing YouTube videos and the only way that money flows to those creators is because of ads. If you make a Windows Phone app that lets you watch Cooking with Dog without the ads, you aren&#x27;t doing Francis any favors by giving out &quot;open access&quot; to his content.<p>(Yes, I did just imply that they are the dog&#x27;s videos.

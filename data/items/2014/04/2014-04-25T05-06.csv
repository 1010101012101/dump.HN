Because some of these cities are so dense with engineers , investors etc that the probability of something positive happening to you is far higher than other cities. for e.g. the odds of getting a meeting with investors or getting feedback on a key product direction will be higher in dense cities such as SF.<p>Of course the tradeoff of that is the costs are higher.

(two months, but we&#x27;re soon to close a million-dollar round) How does that really help you make your decision? You could look at them and try to judge whether they might make their round, but you&#x27;re probably better off in Vegas.<p>How <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> this help you make a decision? Given the number of opportunities out there today, including opportunities outside of Startupville, there&#x27;s no reason an experienced or talented candidate has to gamble on a startup that might not be able to make payroll if a funding round doesn&#x27;t close in the next <i>n</i> weeks or months.<p>By the way: there&#x27;s no such thing as an &quot;as-honest-as-you-can-expect&quot; answer. There&#x27;s an honest answer and there&#x27;s a dishonest answer. A founder, executive or hiring manager at a startup should be able to look you in the eye and tell you how much runway the company has based on its current cash position, cash flow and burn rate. Anything less, including an answer that distorts what &quot;runway&quot; means (hint: funding that you expect to raise but haven&#x27;t yet raised doesn&#x27;t count), is a huge red flag that you ignore at your own peril.",1398405526

Much of the early fossil record consists of remains from shallow seabeds where you had both 1) ample life and 2) persistent sedimentation which would bury and fossilize remains.<p>Those seabeds frequently ended up on land, and not infrequently on mountains, a fact which itself had a strong influence on modern understandings of global biological and geological history.<p>The article (which you clearly didn&#x27;t read) actually makes that point explicitly:<p><i>Marine fossils are protected by layers of marine sediment and the quietude of ocean deeps.

It didn&#x27;t sell very well because the tank took up most of the trunk and the range wasn&#x27;t much better than most electric cars (around 150 miles, as I recall).<p>On top of that, the number of refueling stations is very limited--natural gas pipes are ubiquitous in cities, but they deliver the gas at a much lower pressure.  You still need a roughly $2k compressor to fill the tank overnight (which uses about as much electricity as you&#x27;d put in an electric car).  Commercial stations have more expensive compressors that operate continuously to fill a holding tank which cars are filled from.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible.  But the infrastructure required to put energy in the vehicle costs the same or more as for an electric car.  And you use just as much electricity as an electric car (in addition to the natural gas).

It appears to be pursuing some of them.<p>One is to become a vastly better recommendations engine <i>by becoming interactive</i>.  A constant frustration I&#x27;ve had when looking for products or product information online is in refining my search.  There&#x27;s not a &quot;no, I don&#x27;t want that, I don&#x27;t want anything remotely like that, take it away, don&#x27;t ever show it to me again&quot; button.  A &quot;dismiss with extreme prejudice&quot; button.  A &quot;get it the fuck away and kill it with fire&quot; button.<p>But that&#x27;s exactly the role a very good in-person salesclerk will perform.  They&#x27;ll ask what you&#x27;re looking for, ask for some particulars, then suggest.  And if you don&#x27;t like something, it&#x27;s gone.  No pushing (the ones who push aren&#x27;t very good, and they don&#x27;t get my business).<p>Part of the problem is also that online product descriptions are abysmal.  I was shopping for monitors -- a technical product -- a ways back, and <i>not a single vendor</i> gave me the ability to search by pixel pitch, aspect ratio, and dimension.  I could specify screen size, but there was no way to distinguish a 1080p 36&quot; display from one with a suitably high pitch, a more rectangular aspect, and the size I was interested in.  Scrolling through pages of stuff I wasn&#x27;t interested in.<p>Furniture that fails to show close-up views or 360° rotations on $1000+ items.  Really, you expect me to buy, sight-unseen, and wait 6+ weeks for delivery, based on a single poorly-sized image?<p>Another approach would be to cut out the middleman (advertisers) and sell directly.  Which is what is happening now with Google Express, a WebVan like retail service tied with not a single merchant or large national vendors, but even local services.  That&#x27;s actually a pretty smart concept in my book.<p>There&#x27;s a large and growing backlash to pervasive surveillance, whether by governments <i>or</i> companies, and I think Google&#x27;s getting swept up in it.<p>Microsoft had a business model that worked for it until it didn&#x27;t.

Something built around multicast groups could be used to stream multiple people the same content in a drastically more efficient manner, and then it could be stored locally on clients for time-shifting purposes.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to optimize for efficient use of limited bandwidth, unicast transferring of identical content to many many people is pretty wasteful.  I think Netflix would argue that network links should be getting bigger and fatter to render the point moot, but given the streams are also getting bigger (we didn&#x27;t always stream 720p everywhere, did we?) that would certainly take a lot more investment than what&#x27;s happening now.",1398403545

7644895,comment,7642545,7642545,3,0,zaroth,,,"Netflix presumably was paying Cogent a lot of money for all those 10Gbit uplinks. Now a few cross-connects and BGP tweaks later, a traceroute shows Netflix packets leaving a Netflix server and going more directly onto Comcast&#x27;s network. I can only speculate that they turned on some dark fiber to build cross-connects between their cages and Comcast cages. Maybe they were already in the same building...<p>How much did Netflix&#x27;s Cogent bill go down? How much of the &quot;work&quot; that Cogent was doing is Netflix now doing themselves? How many hops of the traceroute are owned by Netflix, and how many hops by Comcast?<p>When I rent a rack in One Wilshire in LA, CA, it comes with power, cooling, and a network link. When I pay let&#x27;s say $1000/mo for that 1Gbps link, it&#x27;s not just the link from my rack to their router that I&#x27;m paying for. And when I send 1Gbps of packets up through that link, it&#x27;s not just CoreSite at One Wilshire carrying the cost of delivering those packets.<p>At some point, yes, I do expect Comcast to get their &quot;fair share&quot; of that $1k/mo. If Comcast is PAID zero dollars for delivering that 1Gbps, then I want this free bandwidth gravy train to propagate all the way back to me. Comcast, please sign me up for 10 of those free 10Gbe links you&#x27;re giving out, ok? Just tell me where to rent space where I can get those free 10Gbe cross connects to your network.<p>But then, you can also flip the perspective and ask the question, why doesn&#x27;t Comcast have to pay for all their bandwidth? Shouldn&#x27;t they be paying $1,000/mo for their Gbe&#x27;s?<p>So why does bandwidth cost money, or more specifically <i>when</i> should bandwidth cost money? Price, as always, is just a means of efficiently allocating scarce resources. Price can <i>only possibly be zero</i> if there is no scarcity. Is it possible there&#x27;s no scarcity of bandwidth on Comcast&#x27;s network? Now that would be comical!<p>I think the answer lies partially in another development. Ask Netflix to chart the cost in terms of Watts and Rack Units to deliver 1Gbps of video streams. My theory would be the cost in terms of space and electricity to generate 10Gbe of video streams has dropped orders of magnitude. This means bandwidth will be an increasing portion of your bill no matter what. It also puts more pressure on scarcity of bandwidth when the ease of which you can generate 10Gbps of useful traffic is down to just a few servers.",1398403380

411665,story,,,2,4,tmpk,"Ask HN: Where to find a potential co-founder?",,"I know that this might seem like the wrong question to ask. You are supposed to know your co-founder very well by the time you start a company together. But most of the people whom I know from college are not willing to take the risk of starting a company on their own. It's hard to persuade a risk-averse person to become an entrepreneur, and even if I am able to persuade him, some months down the road when the going gets tough, he might be tempted to chicken out.<p>So what are some of the events and groups in the Bay Area that provide good opportunities for meeting potential co-founders? Thanks.",1230436534

The VC community is pretty small and large profile failures like this don't go unnoticed.  I'd imagine that they'll have a lot harder of a time raising this much money ever again.<p>Perhaps that won't matter to them, but then again if they have designs on another company this could have a negative impact on how that plays out.",1230433596

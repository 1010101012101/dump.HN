You can live very comfortably near central London (zone 1-2) in a nice area on £35k. You won't save much money, but once your salary goes up, of course, you will be able to (depending on how you adjust your lifestyle, of course).<p>As for hourly rate, that can be computed easily. My friend works about 12 hours a day, 5 days a week (no weekends, since her work is linked to the markets being opened). She gets 4 weeks of holiday a year, and there's about a week's worth of bank holidays. So that's 47 weeks * 60 hours = 2820 hours a year, on the upper end (assuming no sick days or other unplanned absences).<p>That works just above £53 an hour.<p>You could drive that down by counting her (30 minute or so) commute in, but you won't make much difference. The fact is, she earns very good money no matter which way you cut it. And that's not even counting the (very significant) bonus.<p>I'll grant you that living in Cambridge and working in London is daft, but that's why they have, ya'know, houses and stuff in London. So you can move there rather than spend hours on the train every day.",1277045882
1446539,comment,1445956,1445956,0,0,rleisti,,,"At the beginning of April, I picked up a book called ""The New Rules of Lifting"".  I like it, because it explains how to do a variety of exercises of six kinds: squat, deadlift, lunge, push, pull, twist.  Also, it describes a few programs, which I find very good for motivation as it gives you specific things to do on a regular basis.<p>When I started, I acquired a barbell, two dumbells, a swiss ball and about 80 pounds or so of plates.  I quickly got a squat rack (just something simple; you can only lift so much up to your shoulders and drop it back down safely), but I only recently got a bench.  I now have over 200 pounds of plates, which I got at a used-equipment store.  I've found that you need a lot of weight for a) squats and b) so you can move from one exercise to another quickly without having to move plates from the bar to the dumbells.<p>I also got a ""power gym"": the pull-up device that hangs in a door frame.  With slight modification to one of my door frames in the basement, I found it works pretty well.",1277045875

If the IRS deems an employee misclassified as a contractor, some states – particularly Colorado and Maryland – can enforce hefty tax penalties on the employer. When in doubt, consult the IRS's guidelines on the difference between an independent contractor and an employee here.<p>With the IRS estimating that 15 percent of the U.S. workforce is misclassified, you'll want to be firmly within legal grounds – and to document a work arrangement meticulously – when working with an independent contractor, so that there is no doubt about the nature of the relationship.<p>The basic rule, experts say, is that you determine the what and the contractor determines the how.  You say you want a piece of market research or a graphic design turned into you by a certain date; the contractor decides how to create these deliverables, subject to your approval. It's important to outline specific goals, but the contractor must provide their own tools, equipment, and facilities to complete the work.<p>In probing the nature of the relationship, the IRS might examine the contractor's level of freedom, including setting his or her own hours, paying his or her own business expenses, and hiring support staff or assistants as necessary.""",1277045358

1.Better more in-depth information, using tools like genetic medicine and new bio-markers that can give us a more precise diagnosis(using genetic medicine , hypertension can be classified into more then 10 categories , each with his own preferred treatment). with more precise diagnosis , the chances are greater that we treat the core problem.<p>2. In many cases, we know the core problem, but the tools we can only treat symptoms. For such diseases , a good place to look is emerging technologies focus on the core problem. for example today we treat diabetes type 2 mostly symptomatically, but the core problem is that pancreas cells die or stop functioning. Stem cell therapy is offers big hope as a cure for diabetes type 2 by replacing the bad pancreas cells with new cells.<p>3.i wonder if prevention, in the general case, is relatively more focused on the core mechanisms, simply because when you prevent something , you have no symptoms and symptoms never appear.",1277045140

You need to just ignore him and ride out the storm.<p>I actually had a boss like this once. Not quite as pyscho, but still in the same orbit of madness. What worked for me was quiting. Every time I quit he offered me more money. I went back 4 or 5 times. Over the course of 4 years, my pay went from $15 an hour to $50 an hour.<p>Mind you, it was important to really quit. Bluffing did not work.<p>If I said ""I will quit"" he would say ""I am sorry to hear that but we have no extra money that we can pay you.""<p>Only when I quit and went and got another job did he offer me more money.<p>There came a point when I realized that simply working for him was bad for my career. No matter how much money he paid me, his business was run on a profoundly unprofessional basis. It was never going to lead to something great, and every day working with him was a day spent learning how to deal with a psycho, rather than a day spent learning how to deal with a professional, well run business.<p>So in the end I quit, and he could not offer me more money to stay.<p>That is when he started threatening me with lawsuits. These came in 2 varieties:<p>1.) My non-compete agreement - he briefly argued that my non-compete agreement covered the whole technology industry, so I was not allowed to go to work as a computer programmer anywhere. This was a really a non-issue, partly because no court would uphold such a broad claim, but also because the non-compete agreement had a 2 year limit and when I quit we were only a few weeks away from the end of those 2 years. So the issue just went away.<p>2.) Copyright. He had stupidly never asked me to sign anything regarding copyright. So I owned the copyright on any code I'd written while an independent contractor for him. He then argued that we had had an implicit agreement, and that he would sue me if I ever re-used the code. But I re-used the code on another project, and he never sued me.<p>One thing about these kinds of bosses: they crave control. When you quit, they go wild, because you regaining control over yourself. At such times, such bosses go a little crazy. It's best to ignore most of what they say at such times. 99% of the time, it is all bluff.",1277045032

It also added operational complexity to have to deal with compiling the css.

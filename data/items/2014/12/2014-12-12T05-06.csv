At least in fencing, a right-hander going against a left-hander is a very different situation than two people of the same handedness competing, and because right-handers are such a majority, lefties have loads of time to practice exploiting the lefty-v-righty special case.

For example, C&#x27;s memory model basically assumes a contiguous array of bytes, but with modern systems there is a huge difference in speed between main memory and L1,L2,L3 cache. So in order to avoid costly cache misses you have to access your data in cache friendly ways, as all memory accesses are not equal as in C&#x27;s model. Also consider things like vectorization (SSE, AVX, NEON, etc), memory fences, atomic operations, or threading which are not in C&#x27;s machine model. Various intrinsics, standards (POSIX), and libraries exist to remedy this, but the fact remains that&#x27;s C&#x27;s abstract machine model is getting increasing distant from actual modern hardware.",1418362812

It taught me many things and sparked my interest in computer programming. While my own experience with it was good, I hesitate when recommending it to beginners, especially now in the year of 2014, when machines are much faster and there are so many other exciting languages.<p>C, however, has a lot of traps and pitfalls that can be confusing or discouraging to a beginner. I think there are lot of people out there who gave up on programming because their first experience was in C. Weird operator precedence, automatic type conversions, the c preprocessor, differences between pointers and arrays (especially in regards to multidimensional arrays), the #include guard dance around header files, the way #include and header files works in general... There&#x27;s just a lot of cruft and things about C that complicate the language beyond the inherent complexity of the machine itself. It can also be difficult to learn how to get the whole environment set up, learning about the process of compiling, linking, make, libraries, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think that C is the best first choice of a language for a beginner. Instead I would recommend a language that encourages algorithmic problem solving and computational thinking, something that is a further abstraction from the machine. Then after the student is comfortable with abstract problem solving, and &quot;thinking like a programmer&quot;, you can introduce her to see what goes on &quot;under the hood&quot;, so to speak, and delve into the lower levels.

I don&#x27;t think his stance on that has changed, he just doesn&#x27;t have to say it as loudly. Dorm room startups have become part of the cultural zeitgeist and the word has gotten out. Oscar winning movies have been made about prototypical startup founders, everyone has become familiar with the companies, the people behind them and the amount of money that they make.

A shotgun will keep random thugs away from your home, but it will do nothing to deter a SWAT team.<p>Human rights were designed to prevent systematic abuses that victims cannot possibly protect themselves from, such as Hitler&#x27;s persecution of ethnic minorities. The UDHR of 1948 was a direct response to the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany. The framework of human rights was never intended to protect ordinary people from one another: that&#x27;s what the police is for.",1418360496

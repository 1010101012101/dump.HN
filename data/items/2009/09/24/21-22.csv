But this isn't the responsibility of exceptions; you have to do this cleanup even on normal exit.<p>Code that runs only in exceptional cases is comparatively rare. But with exceptions, you can move that code somewhere else entirely; and with PC-based exception handling, the space cost is only borne when an exception is thrown, when the PC lookup tables need to be paged in. In this scenario, the tradeoff between exceptions and error codes becomes relevant: exceptions let your code get smaller at the cost of a hit when an exception is actually thrown, while error codes bloat your code.<p>Of course, all of the above is not specific to C++. C++ has other deficiencies which can lead to suboptimal pathologies in practice.",1253829123

And I think the public sector is worse at that.""<p>I can think of a number of flaws in this logic - for one, the public sector may not be as good at predicting winners and losers, but public investment can still be valuable if the overall level of investment is too low.  The comparison is not strictly with the same amount of money being invested by the private sector - it is also the same amount of money being used in non-startup investment ways in either the public or private sector.  Additionally, while the private sector will exclusively target companies with the greatest potential return on investment in cash terms, opportunities will be lost where the social benefit of the startup does not translate directly in to revenue, cash and profit.<p>That's assuming that the private sector is in fact better at picking winners, and as I allude to in my last point, that their definition of a ""winner"" is the most beneficial, neither of which are proven.",1253828063

And I think the public sector is worse at that.<p>How should this affect government policy?  Let's take green energy for my example.<p>First I accept the proposition that basic research benefits from government funding.  Why?  Because commercialization timelines from are long, research benefits from sharing knowledge, and free sharing of knowledge causes economic benefits to accrue to different people than the ones who did the research.  Therefore capitalistic incentives don't work so well.  So I'm behind NSF grants into basic science.<p>Second I accept that carbon fuels have significant externalities and cause global warming.  By all means have some kind of carbon tax, or a cap and trade system to make oil more expensive to use.  Economic theory is solidly behind this method of making private companies properly account for externalities.<p>And that is where the government should stop.  If the price of gas is high enough, consumers will demand that companies meet strict fuel standards.  Additional fuel standards regulations are an admission that the incentives are wrong.  If the economic returns are guaranteed to be there, then the free market will throw up solutions.  Direct investment in green technologies is an admission that the economic incentives are not there for alternative energy, and breeds companies that are dependent on that direct investment.",1253827294

The job market is a very special market, because the people who get “bought” are also the people doing all the buying. After all, why is it that people are hired to farm wheat? It’s because, at the end of the day, other people want to buy it. But if lots of people are out of a job, they’re doing their best to save money, which means cutting back on purchases. And if they cut back on purchases, that means there are fewer people for business to sell to, which means businesses cut back on jobs.</i><p>Except this applies to all other markets too. If people can't sell stuff, they won't be able to buy stuff, and this effect can balloon in the same manner. Good luck with your economics, Aaron.",1253827239

842230,comment,841570,842008,0,0,johnb,,,"""insecurity driven development"" is probably a good alternate title for TDD, but instead of taking it at it's trollish face value it can generate a good analogy.<p>If you start walking down a dark alley - you start feeling insecure. You've got a few options from that point.<p>You can back out of the alley and hey, no more insecurity. A little embarrassing but you're feeling OK, you just have to go the long way round the block.<p>You can push on through the alley in the dark - something bad could happen or you could get through fine. You don't really know until you've popped out the other side.<p>Or you could carry a god-damned torch. Obviously when carrying a torch, you don't have it turned on all the time, just when you wander into darker areas where you're less sure of the environment. It lets you walk at full pace without stubbing your toe or getting mugged or whatever.<p>In more concrete terms: I'm a bit of a poor-weather TDDer (same with pair programming) If i start working on something that could be algorithmically challenging, cuts across multiple layers of our app, touches something scary (like our accounting code, because i don't want to lose any of our $$$), or am just plain stumped - I write a test. It fails. I make it pass. I write the next. I make it pass. I realise my code looks like ass, I refactor. The tests still pass.<p>I can give an actual example from this week. Our app is a large RoR app that serves multiple sites from the one codebase based on an internal DSL we have. We're in the final week of a must launch redesign (date was set because of a bunch of marketing, etc) and I get an urgent and large last minute change dropped on my desk (i'm sure you all know that feeling). I'll admit my first move wasn't to go TDD, I just went for the quick and hopeful move of quickly adding some code that looks like it should work to our DSL.<p>It didn't. So my very next move, knowing that I have a deadline I must hit with a risky technical change, was to start writing tests. If i hadn't, I'd have to be verifying my code works by checking around 3 different pages after a server restart which is both slow and 4 layers away from the changes. So it was faster in real time.<p>I'm not a big fan of TDD zealots, TDD is just another tool in the box. But TDD haters really get my goat. You're willfully shutting yourself out of a tool that can make your life easier, and help deliver code faster.",1253827146

842221,comment,842131,842131,0,0,Periodic,,,"The used game market already gives the developers money, because a market for used goods increases the value of new goods.  It comes into play whenever an item retains at least some of its value after being used by the primary consumer.<p>For example, take home prices.  If there were no market for used homes (say there was some strange DRM on houses) very few of us would be willing to put down the huge sums of money required to buy a house, but we do because we know that we can recover a lot of that value later if necessary.  Additionally, houses loose very little value over time and land rarely loses value, making it worth buying a $100k house even if $90k is just tied up as value that you can get back when you sell it.<p>Video games, now that we're beyond the days of cartridges, never actually degrade.  There should be a perfect market for used games, though popularity and time take their tolls.  I'm willing to copies of good year-old games for $30.  If you buy a $60 game and then find me a year later it is almost like you only paid $30 making that other $30 more like an investment required to get the game earlier.<p>If developers continue to try to restrict games to single systems or other ways of limiting the amount of resale, that makes the game worth LESS to me, as I lose the ability to resell or loan out the game.  A healthy used market actually incrases the first-sale market.<p>Perhaps someone else can provide a citation, as I'm unable to find a relevant link via Google.",1253826958

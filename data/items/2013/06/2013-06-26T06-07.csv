A TCP connection requires a handshake and is evidently a much more reliable and safe connection.
A UDP connection doesn&#x27;t require a handshake. This means that you never know if your data has reached its destination or not and due to this is much less reliable. Skype uses a UDP connection, and at times it is evident that it does when video resolution drops, etc.",1372229966

No need to wait for some revolution or anything.<p>To get started in Roku development just takes a Roku device for testing (cheap) and free registration as a developer [1]. You build applications using a custom language (BrightScript) that is similar to Lua or VB. Once you&#x27;re done you can publish your app for free or charge for it. Publishing channels that show up in the main channel store requires Roku testing and certification, which can take a few weeks sometimes.<p>My experience developing apps on Roku has been pretty positive. The biggest negative is the non-standard language and environment (they should have gone with an existing language IMO). Another issue is that you can&#x27;t show foreign language content, they now have a DISH Network exclusive agreement for foreign channels.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.roku.com/developer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roku.com/developer</a>",1372229711

And the set of libraries that was importable was restricted and coding styleguides banned advanced language features like metaprogramming, so we could afford to cut corners on corner cases of the language.  &quot;Decent&quot; performance (i.e. more like Java than CPython) was a requirement, as was multithreading support and lack of a GIL, and RAM usage was also at a premium (which was probably the largest argument against PyPy...also, this was a couple years ago, when PyPy was not as mature).",1372229670

5944549,comment,5943258,5943258,5,0,xenonflash,,,"I don&#x27;t think its correct to say the CPython is slow. What you can more accurately say about CPython is that the performance is highly variable. Some things are very fast, while others are comparatively slow.<p>The slow things tend to be the sort of numerical loops that you see in micro-benchmarks. It&#x27;s no coincidence that the version of Python in the linked article saw its greatest speed up in a numerical loop, but only modest improvement elsewhere. It&#x27;s exactly this sort of simple repetitive operation where interpreter overhead matters the most.<p>Language features that encapsulate complex functionality tend to be harder to speed up in CPython because the VM operates at a fairly high level. In effect you&#x27;re just kicking off a large subroutine that is written in C, and you&#x27;re really executing native code until that operation is complete. You&#x27;re not going to improve very much on that no matter how much you try.<p>What this means is that speed will depend heavily on the type of application program being written, and also on how much the programmer takes advantage of the unique language features. It also makes realistic cross language benchmarks difficult because the right way to do something in Python may not have a direct equivalent in another language. The result tends to be &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; benchmarks, which are exactly the sort of algorithms which CPython does worst at.",1372229522

In fact, it slows down my shopping decision having to put in my zipcode - I&#x27;d far rather see a flat shipping rate.

Very often the way you would do something in Java or C# is the worst possible way to do it in Python. Conversely, the best way to do it in Python often has no direct analogue in Java or C#. With Python, the learning curve is shallow, but it&#x27;s very long, and there&#x27;s lots to learn if you want to reap all the benefits.<p>Without knowing what your data or algorithms are, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to give any sensible detailed advice.

After conferring with ztellman, I suspect this is due to Clojure&#x27;s InternalReduce avoiding extra iterator allocations over vectors, since it can recur f directly over the internal array at each leaf node.",1372226757
5944437,comment,5942990,5944256,1,0,chaz,,,"> ABS brakes<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong: ABS doesn&#x27;t cut off pressure to the brakes but instead relieves extra pressure. At no point can the ABS module ever fully cut off brake pressure that&#x27;s being hydraulically applied by the driver. Incorrect?<p>> electronic throttle control<p>Yes, but my point was that regardless of what the throttle was doing, brakes can counter. If he was alert, he should have had reasonable time to start braking as the throttle opened up.<p>> ever heard about electric assist steering? Mercedes does have it on the C250.<p>Thanks -- this is a good catch.<p>> And btw, the modern cars don&#x27;t explode<p>Agreed.",1372226694

She's joined, and found many of her also non-technically savvy friends on it as well. It's becoming mainstream now. Once it starts hitting critical mass, it'll be much harder to slow.<p>2) Out tonight with a bunch of geeks, and almost every single one has started to use Twitter. Only a few didn't. These are Amazonians, Microsofties, startup folks, etc. That is, these are early adopters. I was shocked by how often Twitter came up in conversation. However, not once did anything about Twitter's downtime come up, and not once did anyone even mention FriendFeed.<p>So, on one hand you have Twitter beginning to go mainstream, and on the other hand you don't see the early adopter types leaving.",1214632661
230502,comment,230179,230179,0,0,jrockway,,,"His regex for adding commas to numbers is a little obtuse. I would just write:<p><pre><code>   scalar reverse join ',', split /\d{3}\K/, reverse $number;\n</code></pre>\nThe reason why people hate regexes are because people use them as a general purpose programming language instead of a concise way of matching strings.   Note that the regex I use just says to ""split the string every third digit"" and the rest of the logic is actual code.",1214632654

230499,comment,230367,230464,0,0,akd,,,"I don't get the allure of Twitter but I know that's because I haven't made the investment to figure it out, and don't actually know what it does. If I signed for an account and started using it I'm sure I'd figure out a way to make it give me some benefit.",1214632358

230492,comment,230347,230347,0,0,aneesh,,,"Great article, but the one point it glosses over is how to get the first customer on board.  It talks about how to identify good markets, as well as what to do when a company is already interested in buying from you.  But getting a big company to come to that stage is non-trivial, and requires several meetings with their management for a big, enterprise sale.<p>So how do you do it?  You can't point to a track record, or other customers, but what you can give your customer(s) is comfort with the sales process, and transparency.  Still it's an uphill battle, and usually you have to talk to a lot more than a few companies to get a contract of this size.",1214631102
230491,comment,230080,230080,0,0,thwarted,,,"These resized-by-the-browser images are getting really annoying, I've noticed an uptick in it the six months or so.  That image is completely unreadable with the explicit height and width in the layout, and it's not overly big that including it all without resizing would matter.  Additionally, you have to click /again/ to see the actual content.",1214631020

""I want the money I pay on my shelter to shelter my family.""<p>It seems that everyone, wants the money they spend to help them and their loved ones to one extent or another.

You can teach animals all kinds of interesting behavior but you can't teach them language.<p>> Yet despite the fact that nobody starting fresh with what we know today would ever propose a theory of innate, universal grammar, we still have most people calling themselves ""modern linguists"" claiming to believe it.<p>Quite the contrary.

The drawback is that when I do it, I'm not getting a consistent, one transaction dump. But then usually, I'm shutting down the system to do an upgrade when I thwack it like this, so it's a reasonable tradeoff. With a fast set of drives, I can generally dump and reload with a concurrency of roughly O(#cores) in approximately the time it takes for the largest table, rather than the sum of the times for all the tables.<p>(there's a caveat there, and that's that my biggest tables tend to be toasted, so there's a decent processor load uncompressing the toasted bits. Also, Power law governs table size, and the biggest table is ~ 50+ % of the database, with ~ 100 tables. YMMV)<p>I wish there was a way to transparently parallelize operations over more than one core. I've got enough operations that are actually processor bound that I could benefit (some) from it.

My opinion is clear from that discussion.<p>The other feature in this list that I really, really like is session tracing.  When I used to work with Oracle I implemented a feature that allowed any web page to have the database session logged if you passed in a magic parameter.  This was unbelievably useful in debugging performance problems on the live system as they were happening.  In fact it proved so useful that we would turn tracing on for one session for some period of time each day, inserting pointless marker queries at the start and end of each web page.  We then ran a script through the log to be able to break it up by web page, looked at the slow web pages, what they did, and thought about how we could make it faster.  This exercise suggested optimizations that resulted in something like doubling the capacity of our website on that hardware.<p>This is invaluable data that you simply cannot collect in any other way.  You certainly can't turn on logging for the whole database - the website will crash.  Sure you can log things at the application level - I did that as well.  But it just says, ""We ran these queries and got this timing.""  It doesn't shed light on what is happening inside of the database.",1302756250

It's like asking ""well that's a good screwdriver, but does it hammer nails?"".<p>The <i>correct</i> question to ask is: what do I get from this syntactic sugar, and what do I trade. Or to stick with our metaphor:<p>""What does this screwdriver bring to the table, and does it INTERFERE with the hammering of nails etc?"".<p>So as stated, CS lets you write code faster, express yourself more clearly, and removes headaches common to Javascript. These headaches are problems that are largely not addressed by other tools like jQuery (which have different goals).<p>To answer your questions:<p>> Does it fix browser incompatibilities for you<p>Yes, but only in terms of the language. CS compiles to lowest common denominator Javascript, so you know the compiled code will run just about anywhere.<p>So you don't have to worry about whether or not the browser's JS engine supports list comprehensions, because you're using CS.<p>The question is not so much ""Does it fix browser incompatibilities for you"".... but ""Does it introduce browser incompatibilities?"". To that, the answer is no.<p>>Does it optimize Javascript to run faster?<p>CS allows you to write really expressive code that gets compiled down to simple (but verbose) forms. This has the side-effect that CS code will generally be faster than Vanilla JS code that is written with a similar expressiveness.<p>In Vanilla JS you would generally have to introduce a library to get the same expressiveness, and that has a run-time penalty. For example: Something that is compiled to a simple for-loop in CS would require a bunch of function calls in a library in vanilla JS, adding a lot of overhead.<p>CS is not a tool to optimize code, so asking if it optimizes code misses the point. The real question is whether or not it introduces inefficiency, because if it does....that's a drawback that needs to be contrasted to it's benefits.<p>In this case, no it doesn't...and the code it produces is sometimes faster than similar vanilla JS code.<p>>Does it have a kick-ass library that's optimized for it?<p>CS is not meant to fill the same role as a library.<p>The question is not ""does it have a library""...but ""what's the implications of using CS vis a vis libraries?"" The answer is CS interacts with JS seamlessly, use any library you like.<p>>Is it easier to debug?<p>No, because that's not the point of CS. CS is not a debugging tool. The right question is: ""is it harder to debug?"".<p>Here we hit what imho is the only real trade-off involved in CS.<p>Some will hem and haw about having an explicit compilation step; but the tooling support for CS is great and any serious JS developer can fit it into their dev process seamlessly (via commit hooks, watch, build scripts, etc).<p>Debugging problems is a legit concern, but in my experience it does not add significant problems. Errors in CS syntax are generally caught during compilation and other errors can often be easier to find because the CS code is cleaner and it's easier to catch errors in logic.<p>I think beginners will often hit problems with debugging and CS because it adds a layer to confuse them. Experienced JS devs on the other hand should be able to cleanly separate the layers and debug them effectively.<p>The tooling for debugging CS in the future looks promising and will improve the situation.<p>As for your suggestion that you could just improve your text-editor, use macros, etc....I think that's a good tool to have in your belt but it just doesn't compare to what CS brings to the table.<p>Either you'd be duplicating CS's efforts ...or you'd not hit the same level of capability...<p>In the first case, it'd be a pointless re-inventing of the wheel, but your wheel would have drawbacks CS lacks.<p>With CS there is:<p>- Lot's of editor support. Your suggestion is tied to 1 editor.<p>- Lot's of tooling support. There is framework support, and possible browser support in the future...etc etc. Yours would have none, or would need it written.<p>- Widespread use. Lots of coders will understand my CS \ncode right off the bat, or can learn it easily. Not only will no one understand your crazy macros etc, there's little incentive to learn them.<p>In the latter case, it's not a valid comparison.<p>The real question here is what does CS bring to the table, and what do you trade for it. CS had demonstrable benefits and demonstrable drawbacks.<p>It's my opinion that the benefits dramatically outweigh the drawbacks, but that's a question every developer must ask and answer for themselves.<p>I get that your contention is somehow, ""well if it doesn't do these specific things, it's not 'life changing'"", but that seems a pretty arbitrary line to me.<p>I don't see how you can say developer productivity is not a vital factor in development....and that something that improves productivity, readability, development speed, etc...is not ""life-changing"", at least as much so as the other factors you mentioned.<p>When judged in terms of what it's goals are, I think CS is highly effective and far from ""pure syntactic sugar"" (which to me implies something that simply saves typing).",1302755881

2445563,comment,2444254,2445213,1,0,Umofomia,,,"The fact that native speakers of a single language disagree on the validity of certain utterances does not invalidate the concept of Universal Grammar.  No two individuals learn their native languages in exactly the same way.  The language that they pick up is shaped by their unique experiences with other people using the language, so it is unlikely that any two individuals have the exact same ""instance"" of the language (a more technical way to put this is that everyone has their own ideolect), and thus may differ in the judgements on whether particular utterances in that language are valid.<p>Even though individuals may speak the same language, because the concept of this language in each of their heads may differ slightly due to their individual experiences, one could say that a few of their parameters differ. If groups of individuals are separated from one another, these parameters can end up diverging between populations, leading to differing dialects and even separate languages over longer periods of time.<p>From reading the Ars Technica piece (I don't have access to the original Nature article), it seems like they've shown that language features are highly dependent on lineage, but I don't see how this result is incompatible with the concept of Universal Grammar. Because a language has to be relearned by every individual born into the language environment, there is a lot imperfect copying going on, leading to individuals having slightly different parameters of their Universal Grammars.  There is a direct biological analogy here: imperfect copying of DNA leads to mutations which can lead to speciation over time.  The values of the DNA base pairs are the parameters, but the mechanism by which the DNA is translated into proteins by every individual is still the same.  This mechanism is analogous to Universal Grammar translating parameters into the actual spoken language.<p>It is true that Universal Grammar tends to look at statistical occurrences of features across languages in order to deduce universal statements about them.  This is the weakest part of the theory, because the absence of a feature across all languages does not necessarily mean that such a feature cannot arise, nor does the presence of a feature across all languages necessarily mean that it must always be present.  Perhaps one of the worst results of language extinction is the fact that there will be fewer data sets to test proposed language universals against.<p>To address your other assertion, the concept of Universal Grammar does not only apply to syntax.  For instance, there are phonological universals, which are deduced based on phonotactics of known languages.  For example, all known languages have at the very least the minimal vowel system of three vowels /i a u/ or slight variations thereof.",1302754090

I am a practicing experimental scientist but with minimal knowledge of statistics, so factor that into whatever I say here.<p>They point out that a negative ruling (""no"" or ""almost - come back next time"") is much easier to deliver. There is less thought involved, nobody will raise eyebrows and the paperwork is much lighter. So the trend is more about mental energy than grumpiness. They note the significance of the breaks, but do not attempt to disentangle the role of mood improvement / a blood sugar boost / rest.<p>They explicitly discuss the possibility of hidden variables:\n""A key aspect for interpreting the association ... is whether an unobserved factor determines case order in such a way that yields the pattern of results we obtain""\nThe dip and spike patterns in the rulings are quite pronounced, and similar graphs in the article for parameters such as the gravity of the offense, presence of a rehabilitation plan and the number of previous incarcerations do not show any such trends. This addresses questions about case scheduling by the clerks. Besides which - even if the clerks did organize easier cases for later in the day, this would manifest as one long trend over the entire day, not the spike/decay sequence shown.<p>So I didn't see any gaping holes, and more importantly it seems quite a plausible conclusion to me. Surely you must have had a similar experience going Christmas shopping - you start out thinking very carefully about getting the perfect gift for every person, but after 3 hours trudging around in a mall you'll just buy any old shit so you can go home.

First, it <i>certainly is</i> possible to use objects with it; you may need a ""%s"" and a call to stringObject.c_str(), but it's no big deal.<p>There are many reasons to prefer printf() variants or other functions that use format strings, over the ""standard"" C++ stream mechanisms.<p>The main reason is that they're actually more convenient than stream classes in many cases.  It is easier to see at a glance what the output will be, and it is a <i>hell</i> of a lot less kludgey to make certain things work.  You also don't see stupid type problems like I did in a recent Linux port, where ""object << std::string"" had worked fine with one compiler and OS but not the other (an ""object << C string pointer"" definition was temporarily needed to bridge the gap).<p>C++ streams encourage code that constructs a lot of temporary objects; just look at the tricks required by standard-library implementations to get manipulators that take arguments, like ""setw(int)"", to even work!  It is not <i>impossible</i> to avoid this, but programmers are not <i>likely</i> to, which makes it a bad paradigm.<p>Though not possible with printf() itself, format strings <i>in general</i> are more flexible than sequences of data.  For instance, localization-aware code uses format strings because it's very important for another language to be able to say ""%d %s"" even if the English version uses the ordering ""%s %d"" (see for example CFStringCreateWithFormat() on Mac OS X, where substitutions can be placed arbitrarily).  You also want to be able to swap in <i>an entire translated string</i>, and not have to piece together tidbits that are in between ""<<"" operators.<p>About the only defensible use of streams is for files, because by default they support RAII and make it a little easier to automatically clean up.  Of course, it takes 2 minutes to write a wrapper class that does the same thing for any other kind of file representation, and then you have exception safety anyway.",1302753890

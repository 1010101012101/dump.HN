Some random advice:<p>On timelines:
-> An old guideline is to try breaking each deliverable into individual, atomized tasks. Put an estimate on each task. Add it all up and double the final amount.
-> Use something like pivotal tracker, or redmine, or Jira.<p>On getting reliable estimates from developers:
-> Each dev is different in their estimations. Get to know their quirks. Some feel that everything is easy and tend to say ""two days"" for everything. Others will try to buy as much time as possible and will tell you ""a week"" for something that will normally only take them a day. Knowing their tendency will let you make adjustments.<p>On getting to know the devs:
-> Start by getting to know the difference between estimated and actual time on smaller issues.<p>Quick Daily Meeting:
-> Spend 10 minutes at the start of each day to get a status update - what is each member working on? Are they facing any problems? Is anything taking more time than it should?
-> Make adjustments to your timelines accordingly if you have to.<p>Try not to micromanage. They should let you know when they face problems. That said, radio silence is bad... thats what the daily should help alleviate.",1308560030

""To ensure justice was done"" is the official explanation, but in reality, it's to satisfy the victim's desire for revenge.<p>Over here, the victims of a crime are part of the process only as witnesses, and then they're out. There are no juries to sway with emotion, all sentence lengths are standardized by law, and ""life in prison"" means 20 years, max.<p>There is no public opinion that we should be ""tougher on crime"", no political parties are campaigning with the promise to increase sentence lengths or be harder on criminals, some want more resources and money to the police, but that's it.<p>There's a general awareness that prisons actually harden criminals, that the more time they spend with each other, the more likley they are to return to a life of crime when they get out. We try not to mix people serving a sentence for the first time, with people who are return criminals.<p>The primary purposes of prisons is of course to lock people up, to remove them from society, to ensure they can't move freely or do work or business, but there is a secondary explicit purpose, and that is to rehabilitate as effectively as possible, to give the prisoners as much help and support as possible, to make sure they don't commit crimes again.<p>It is very common over here that people who commit murder are sentenced to forced psychiatric rehabilitation instead of prison, and you do psychiatric evaluations of everyone accused of violent crimes, so there's an underlying general sentiment that criminals are sick, not evil.<p>Of course a lot of people mistrust former convicts, of course a lot of people think criminals deserve to be put away, but there's a lot less of those sentiments over here, compared to the US. Our prison population per capita here in Sweden is also 1/10th of the US average.<p>So, given all this, the news that a lot of criminal behaviour can be explained by brain malfunction isn't devastating at all. Quite the opposite, it means that you suddenly have more ways to rehabilitate criminals, if you can remove a tumor or fix a chemical inbalance, that's good! It means even less people in jail, and less violent crime.<p>But if the primary purpose of your justice system is to ensure the victims get their revenge, then it's not helpful, it's not good, because it will ""rob"" victims of their revenge.",1308559309

They mostly don't even look at the url, they look at what the page says. If you want to send the link to someone, you copy the whole thing anyway. If you do a little word of mouth, you probably won't include any TLD at all, so Google is again your target destination.

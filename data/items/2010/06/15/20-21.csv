The code you have to use to query it is not verbose. Typically when I see the word ""overkill,"" I expect that there is some downside for using an approach that is too powerful.

This is not 'bad' in google ethics - think of how there is no search bar in chrome - when i type 'hacker news' into chrome, hackernews.com is #3; the line between a search and almost typing in an exact domain name makes these domains valuable, and uneducated users who don't know the difference between a search and a domain mean this won't change anytime soon.<p>2. Mahalo could be auto-generating content that should be penalized because it is duplicate or spammy. This is, within the terms of the googleverse, 'bad' and can be penalized. However it's not clear that all of those sites are exactly the same (i didn't click through each one) - they may be different enough but just share a similar URL structure, which if the content is different, is not really an issue.",1276635428

1433865,comment,1433676,1433676,0,0,swirlee,,,"Contrary to what these initial comments are suggesting, Mahalo isn't duplicating content across all of these sites. These sites are each targeted at specific verticals, and (are intended to) only have questions and answers related to that vertical. It's a strategy that worked for Calacanis at Weblogs, Inc. (to a degree--eventually a lot of superniche blogs were shuttered or consolidated into the higher-profile brands) and I suspect it'll work again.<p>As for Google's rankings, I don't think these sites are any worse off than the Stack Exchange sites, which all share the same basic design and markup and many of the same boilerplate About, etc. pages.<p>Is it great for users, i.e. people actually trying to find answers? Well, that's an open question. I think ultimately it is because someone looking for FarmVille answers (yes, Mahalo has such a site, and yes, an incredible number of people have FarmVille questions) is going to get more relevant results than they'll find on Mahalo Answers proper. If these sites didn't exist would they find better, or faster, answers to their questions? I think sometimes they would, sometimes they wouldn't. Generally answers on Mahalo Answers are higher-quality than, say, Yahoo! Answers, which I see showing up in the results for many of my Google searches.<p>I don't blame anyone for disliking the practice--it does have a bit of a smell--but I do think it's a good business decision for Calacanis et al.<p>(Disclosure: I used to work for Jason Calacanis at Weblogs, Inc. and Propeller (nee Netscape.com) and enjoyed the experience. I haven't talked to him in a couple years but I bet if I called him up he'd do me a solid. Oh, I was also an early Mahalo beta-tester and use Mahalo Answers once every couple of months.)",1276635411

I certainly would have taken it if I felt that it was necessary to keep the regular job.<p>That option is, get help. You have a steady, reliable job now, and you might not enjoy it, but you might also be surprised at how much more enjoyable it can be if you have a successful business on the side that's <i>taking care of itself</i>. Also, I'm beginning to think that ""getting help"" is one of the most challenging steps an entrepreneur eventually has to take; why not handle it right away?<p>Take a day or two off from your regular job, if you can. A long weekend would be good. Decompress a little -- but don't procrastinate! -- and then sit down and draft an idea of what you want your business to do, and when you want it to do it. It doesn't need to be fancy; it doesn't need to be a business plan. Just: ""in X months my business should be doing Y"" kind of stuff.<p>Then, once you've got a clear idea of what you want to accomplish, start looking for people that can help you do it. The economy is your friend right now -- you should be able to find some part-time or contract help for pretty cheap. You'll get to learn how to manage them really effectively, since you won't be able to look over their shoulders 40 hours a week.<p>Two years from now, you can have your green card, <i>and</i> you can be way ahead of schedule in your business, just because you got help sooner rather than later.",1276635224

That's why it makes a great example of this phenomenon; people will look back and see all the (in retrospect) obvious signs of a coming default and wonder why it wasn't obvious now.<p>I would hope the structural differences between the US situation in 1945 and now would be obvious - exporter vs importer, young vs old, short term debt (the war) vs long term (SS and Medicare, plus maintaining an ongoing worldwide military presence). And we don't currently have the advantage that every possible economic competitor of ours was recently carpet bombed and utterly drained by years of total war, which certainly didn't hurt our exports.<p>Adding for clarity: I don't currently believe either a default or major coastal flooding is inevitable or unstoppable, I just think there is substantially more risk associated with it than is generally perceived. Ironically, the perception of little risk can help make such events more likely, because after all there is little point wasting lots of effort trying to prevent something that probably won't happen, right?",1276635057

As one friend of mine (whose father is high up in India's air force) put it, ""The only real question is whether the bomb that Pakistan drops on New Delhi works.""<p>To be specific, the likely scenario is that they go to war, Pakistan, lacking reserves, knows it has to win fast.  Pakistan throws everything into the battle front, India breaks through somewhere, and Pakistan, with nothing to stop India's breakthrough, drops a nuke on Indian troops in Pakistani territory.  (There is a perverse logic to having all of the civilian casualties be your own.)  India, having just lost major numbers of troops, has little choice but to escalate to nuclear war against Pakistani military targets.  Pakistan, with a more limited supply of nukes, has only one way to escalate.

Just make sure you have an office address,letterhead, phone numbers, a bank account and good lawyers. The USCIS will often pick up on little details that show the business is being run out of someones backyard.<p>The hardest part is in the early stages, prior to transferring the H1B visa, because technically the visa holder can have no involvement in the company i.e. cannot attend meetings or talk about the opportunity without violating their status.<p>One approach I used successfully was to get my accountant to create an LLC. The LLC held my shares in the new startup. My immigration attorney then applied for a part-time concurrent H1B to work for that LLC as a board member a couple of hours a week, in parallel with myexisting H1B visa, allowing me to be involved from day one (you can start work the moment the visa is filed).

I'm an Engineer working at a big corp in California - a job I so hate but have been needing to hold on to for green card purposes (I'm a foreign citizen). I'm still at least 2 years away from getting it. Meanwhile, in my spare time, I've been hacking away on my boostrapped startup idea. I released a MVP two months ago and it has been gaining steady traction. I intend to hit ramen profitability by early next year. This is where it gets hard on me. In spite of spending many waking hours working on it, moonlighting often translates to slow progress. At the end of a full 10 hour day working for the man, creativity and productivity are not at their peak when I get to work in the evenings. I fear that when competition gets wind of the opportunity that exists in their blind spot, they will get to work and could outdo me quickly.<p>One option is quitting my job cold turkey but that may mean going back to my home country. I've lived in the US for 8+ yrs now and want to stay here. I want to build my business here. I like it here. Is that so bad? Isn't America the land where you can realize your dream and help others realize theirs too?<p>It gets very frustrating at times and I fear my dream is slipping away. I will turn 30 soon (no, that is not precipitating this :). I'd like to spend the next decade of my life building my own company, not waiting for a green card. I am making progress but at a snail's pace (at least I feel so). Plus from my last venture, I learned the lesson that working with a useless co-founder is worse than going it alone. This time, I am solo-ing until I can find a partner who is as passionate & hard working.<p>I've been bearing this situation for two years now and feel like I'm stuck in this rut for the foreseeable future.<p>Are any of you in similar shoes? How do you deal with it? Are there any immigration hacks that you are aware of? Have you figured out some way to spend a major chunk of your time working on your startup but staying in legal status and maintaing your perm residency petition?<p>tl;dr: Working on startup venture.

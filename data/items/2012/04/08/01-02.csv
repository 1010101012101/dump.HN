Humans are weird creatures, and not really made up of completely disembodied rational minds. Even simple things like choosing to read in one location versus another seem to make significant differences, so I can see not having internet at home making differences too (some positive, some negative).<p>I had no internet in my apt for a few months, and it was also right after I had moved to a new city (it was semi-accidental, due to bullshit with a ""pre-wired for ethernet"" apartment that I took way longer to give up on than I should have). The mixture of having no internet and not much else in the apt was interesting. It was easier to unwind at the end of the day; go home, cook, read a magazine or book, go to bed. There just wasn't enough in the house to keep me up.<p>It's true that when you have the internet, with all the information and possibilities, it's like I have both an entire library and an entire workshop always available to me. And how am I going to go to sleep in the middle of all that?

XSLT, to me, represented the first attempt at truly separating data from layout.  Even to this day, with all the 'div' based layouts and such, nothing completely and totally separates the data and view tiers in a web layout quite the way that XML with an XSLT stylesheet did.<p>Early browser bugs probably caused more harm than good for XSLT adoption.  XSLT was available in browsers almost from the beginning, more powerful (at the time) than any other client side (javascript) solution.  Too bad it didn't get off the ground some more, it might have actually changed the way we work today.<p>Yes, it's too verbose, and probably doesn't deserve the title of ""programming language.""

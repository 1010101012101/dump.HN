254057,comment,253378,253378,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"I was in a similar situation and I can totally relate to Vimeo's decision. Gamer population has two funny properties that can drive any service provider nuts:<p><pre><code>  (a) Gamers don't have money\n  (b) Gamers stress *the hell* out of the service once it becomes popular with them\n</code></pre>\nThere are certainly adult gamers, but your average gamer is a teen with no money of his own and who is also <i>very</i> accustomed to a freeloading. This means that it's virtually impossible to convert gamers to paying customers. Nor does their existence in a user base add much to the company valuation, because of a non-existent cross-sale potential. Nor do their ad clicks have much value.<p>For all practical intents and purposes, the gaming crowd is interesting almost exclusively to the gaming-related companies. If you are not in that segment, the chances are that your service would fare better without gamers.",1216787487

If there are more 'exotics' to go around and they become more easily accessbile (i.e. low transaction fees), wouldn't there be more competition on the currency market? Online retailers could quote prices in the currency of their choice and you'd get an instant quote in the currency of <i>your</i> choice out of that. As for the non-guaranteed quotes and the latency, I'm not sure whether someone has seriously tried to get their head wrapped around that, so there's room for innovative routing mechanisms. As for me it'd be fine to just do this as a thought experiment and then apply the results to poor man's P2P networks which are more accessible in the first place and see what comes out of that.",1216787372

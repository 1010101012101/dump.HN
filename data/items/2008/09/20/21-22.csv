I don't say the reason will be Higgs Boson altering it's past, though. But considering what this LHC stuff is all about, I wouldn't rule out unprovable assumptions.",1221947488

It's targeted at the market that doesn't necessarily want their computer to be ""special"". So, all Microsoft has to do is keep reminding us that Windows users are the majority. It's not an Apple-reinforcing disaster as this article implies.",1221945540

310076,comment,310022,310072,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"""The authors reason that any accelerator which surpasses a certain threshold of super-high-energy collisions (thus producing many of these new particles) will never go into operation because it violates some yet-unknown universal law. As evidence, they provide the failed Superconducting Super Collider, which Congress canned in 1993 after spending $2 billion on the project.""<p>Im just going to assume that a system as large and complex as the LHC is just hard to maintain, thats a much better explanation, because it doesn't involve too much unprovable assumptions.",1221945046

Like I repeatedly saw an overwhelming tendency for Asian engineers to overwork to appear more impressive while non-Asian engineers seemed to leave exactly on time. Overall, I think it&#x27;s pathetic that there is this outdated working ethic still being played out amongst the Asian community but it&#x27;s also why the salaries are suppressed, why overwhelming workforce of startups in Vancouver are Asians. The stereotypes is being self enforced by Asian engineers and it was pretty sad to see. One senior Asian engineer (probably making less than $70k/year) loved pointing out how early I was leaving (leaving at 5:00pm is too early apparently) and that I wasn&#x27;t doing enough. He explained how in Asia he used to work on weekends and that this was the norm. It&#x27;s pretty much a shit show but I saw this happen at other startups as well and pretty much put me off from ever working again in Vancouver.<p>In fact I&#x27;m not surprised that lot of vancouverites here are working remotely for American clients. The work/life balance culture is horrid for the most part, far less pay and competitive landscape commoditizing each other. There are plenty of sweatshop employers in vancouver who fully exploit this fact. However, enough is enough, once you remove yourself from such toxic job market you start finding out just how much money there is to be made outside of Vancouver. I still get recruiters trying to pitch me on some job and they are becoming increasingly pushy and spammy. Not all of them are bad but it appears the problem in the article is very real, there are literally not many willing engineers who respect themselves to put up with low pay and crappy work/life balance. And so far the HN vancouverite users seems to be exactly doing that, working remotely for a market outside Vancouver or physically moving to American cities. I can also see new grads are looking for jobs outside of Vancouver, so the brain drain is no longer the case where somebody relocates but as Holmes illustrates in the article, it&#x27;s becoming decentralized.<p>If you quit your job in Vancouver, and you found a gig for American client, it would make financial sense especially because the cost of living does not match up to the average salary here.<p>A city is more than just cost of living and housing prices. It is nothing without the people and community. there was a recent debate of how lacking Vancouver is in terms of community and that people were largely feeling isolated in Vancouver. I remember someone from Brazil accurately pointing out how difficult it was to make friends or even talk to people. On the surface they seem receptive and helpful to newcomers but how dare they attempt at some friendship or extend the conversation. This also spills into the night life scene in Vancouver which is pretty much dead on arrival, shuts down after 1 AM, lack of disposal income means a lot less happier people and more people spending time at home, smoking reefer and indulging in some activity with friends they probably knew since kids.<p>If you saw the bar culture here it&#x27;s pretty much everybody keeping to themselves at their own tables and not wanting to be bothered. Like even a friendly attempt is typically shot down quickly. It&#x27;s almost like people are on guard and they think that you want something from them when all you are doing is just small chat and trying to meet new people.<p>I&#x27;m willing to put up with Vancouver for a while longer until I figure out which city I want to work remotely from but it certainly will be even a faster acceleration of the trend where the brain drain starts with someone exiting the local job market and finding new ones south of the border. Thanks to remote jobs, this brain drain is far more quicker and eventually devastating to the future of Vancouver&#x27;s tech scene, since not even it&#x27;s own inhabitants are willing to work here, how could they convince SV engineer to work here? It&#x27;s hypocrisy at best.",1439094552

Are you asking me to find out what I think, or are you just asking in order to prove a point? It&#x27;s unclear, as you&#x27;ve mentioned yet again how you have no particular interest in Ms. Wenger...
>> What is it that bothers you about people who have jobs coding calling themselves &quot;software engineers&quot; when you don&#x27;t think they qualify?
I can&#x27;t imagine that three months of experience makes anyone particularly qualified for anything but to learn that they like something, which is not necessarily bad. But why three months? Why not at least a year, like the Udacity Android developer programmer?<p>>>I think a survey of job postings would confirm that even entry-level job postings, for which someone with 3 months of training might qualify, are routinely advertised as &#x27;software engineer&#x27; positions. So it may not be &quot;just what I think&quot;.
Have you done a survey of entry-level postings?  Given that reading comments in an article already constitute &quot;research&quot; to you, so I&#x27;m guess the answer is no. Thus it is indeed &quot;just what you think&quot; (And perhaps what some HR personnel think). It&#x27;s just unfortunate that somewhere in the hiring process, people with a 3-month bootcamp experience can get hired but older software engineers/developers can&#x27;t. Seems that the valley can&#x27;t keep female CS/EECS/SEng grads in tech and can&#x27;t hire older developers after age 30. But web bootcamps can certainly pop up and try to sell the myth that one can become a fully-contributing software engineer after three months.<p>Your only interesting point was the sharing of the accordion story and generosity of spirit. Thank you for that exchange.",1439093732

I would be surprised if it became commercially available this soon, but it would be great to have a MBP with the new xeon and xpoint memory instead of the SSD.  The xpoint memory is supposed to be as much as 1,000x faster than SSD while drawing less power and having a lot more write-cycles.",1439093616

Java compromises were coming into my news feed at a higher rate than Windows despite all its native code. Got bad enough that Krebs on Security simply recommended taking Java off one&#x27;s machine unless they absolutely need it. Nice that you named many top tech firms with smart, well-funded NOC&#x27;s and security teams as the counter-example. Harder for individuals and smaller firms than simply installing what works and hardly anyone is attacking. ;)<p>On second point, Erlang on the JVM currently gives same scaling, real-time properties, easy distributed apps, and availability as BEAM? And without one of the commercial VM&#x27;s you seem to be assuming (but not stating) for eg real-time? If so, you might have a strong argument on that end. You just need to demonstrate each with examples of real-world apps running in Erlang on each. More people would accept your claim if you demonstrated it.",1439093147

They also have SUPER large overhead charges from all these people wanting to join the 10 towers in the bay area. But thats okay though because they are supporting us with jobs, and this awesomely fast internet connection.
But there are Viable options to switch over too, if you wanted to get unlimited data THAT provider only has 1 tower, so their service is a little worse.<p>Korea will always think that they have it good over there, but they will never experience the truly awesome internet that we have here.

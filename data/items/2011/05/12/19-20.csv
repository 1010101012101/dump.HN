It had an ancient and crufty OS and needed to find a new OS outside the company because it failed to develop one internally at least twice. They could go with BeOS, NeXT or MkLinux (I run MkLinux on one Mac in my collection). NeXT came with Steve Jobs bundled for free.<p>At that time, Apple leveraged its bets making Java development a first-class citizen. It was not clear whether Objective-C would gain any foothold because it failed to get traction during its NeXT years.",1305230384

My point is that they couldn't buy a company like Apple and do as well as Apple did being independent. Had they bought all of Apple in 1997, Apple would not exist today.

When coming up with a curriculum I chose the Arduino because it's development environment ran on MacOS and Linux (every engineer at Google had either a MacOS or Linux laptop, no Windows) and its use of C++ lite type models was a good match for the codebase they worked in on a day to day basis.<p>I designed (but sadly never got into production) a 'super sheild' which, if you installed the connectors in the Freeduino 'upside down' (relative to the instructions) you could plug it onto the robot shield thing which had 6 AA size batteries, a couple of motor controller chips, mounts for the GM8 (Solarbotics again) wheels with wheel encoders. And a bunch of bits for sensor logic.<p>That being said I certainly can't take credit for Google picking the platform as some of the folks were already familar with it but still its nice to see that this effort has lived on as it were.",1305230274

France, Italy, Turkey, and Russia have horrendous prisons where in many cases prisoners don't survive their sentences.  France's prisons are so historically bad that they've spawned whole revolutions numerous times, and are a common factor in their history.  The EU was supposed to improve these conditions but it remains to be seen given they have very little data on how they're run, let alone anything publicly accessible.<p>In Asia only Japan has decent well run prisons, but their prisons are harsh while still having a high success rate.  In the rest of Asia prisons are typically horrible, and even S.Korea has some awful conditions.  Last thing I read said they don't feed prisoners and keep them in tiny huts, requiring their relatives to come and feed them.  Burma is a massive police state with actual slaves by law.<p>In Africa, if you remove countries that just don't even have working governments, you find the prisons are also horrible, with the exception of <i>maybe</i> South Africa, but even they've had a history of nasty evil and torture (read about Steve Biko).  It's improved a lot, but not nearly as much as it should.<p>The US is similar to Europe, with some of the worst and some of the best prisons in the world.  Now, we're not talking about American legal policy on things like wrongful imprisonment by the LA Crash unit, idiotic ""3-strikes your out"" laws, or minimum sentencing laws.  I'm talking the actual conditions of the prisons in the US as labeled by organizations like Amnesty International.  In our case, prisons are generally alright, with a few standout offenses like Sheriff Joe Arpaio in AZ, and most prisons in the south and California.  The worst state is definitely California, which makes sense given they've had more complete city wide riots than any other state in the nation and their huge gap between rich and poor.<p>But, a significant difference between our prison system and many others around the world (even those in Europe) are our laws about open records on how they're run and our recent trend of civilian oversight groups and recitivism prevention.  Starting in about 2004 there's been a huge push to increase monitoring of prisons, offenses, guard abuses, and to help parolees stay out of jail.  I personally worked on systems that tracked guard abuses at Riker's Island and the NYC DOC, as well as finger print systems for prisons that do early release programs and job release programs.<p>The <i>biggest</i> problem in American prisons is the advocacy by law enforcement of inmate-on-inmate rape as a sanctioned form of punishment.  There's been numerous cases of countries refusing to extradite criminals based purely on our joke that a man will get ass raped in prison.  If you wanted to focus your activism and hatred on any one thing to improve our system, it would definitely be eliminating rape.<p>In general, through my research and my own need to improve prisons, I found that prisons are horrible poorly managed hell holes everywhere.  They generally reflect the cultural fear of the dominant members of a region against the ""unclean"" citizens, outsiders, and the low class.  The difference between American prisons and this one in N.Korea is the size of it and the blatant attempt to keep it secret from the rest of the world.  <i>Very</i> few countries in the world try to hide prisons, and when they do it's considered horrible, but none of them are hiding a prison that's the size of Manhattan:<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=90km+square"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=90km+square</a>",1305228030

Turning completeness means that a language can calculate Pi: it doesn't mean that it can open a file or send data over a network, and it says nothing about efficiency.  So when you argue that Turing-completeness is what makes it possible to run lots of different kinds of VMs on the same machine, it's hard to take such an argument seriously.",1305227907

2541923,comment,2540820,2541485,7,0,simonw,,,"We do plan to move beyond Twitter eventually, but it's actually been incredibly important in getting the site off the ground. We're not just using Twitter for login, we're using it as an external identity provider.<p>For example, if @barackobama is speaking at a conference you can add him to that event on Lanyrd. He gets an unclaimed profile page on the site (which he can sign in to claim later) but more importantly anyone who follows him on Twitter gets that event recommended to them when they sign in.<p>When we launched the site, we had over 500 speaker profiles despite just two of us populating the data. Since those speakers tended to have large numbers of followers, there was a high chance that our first users who signed in would see at least a few event recommendations. This solved the bootstrapping challenge faced by any new piece of social software.<p>The same trick wouldn't work nearly as well with LinkedIn and Facebook, for two reasons.<p>Firstly, both of those networks feature two-way relationships where the other party has to approve your connection. This makes it harder to follow people who you admire but who don't know you in return - exactly the kind of people you might want to see speak at an event.<p>Secondly, the privacy expectations for those networks are completely different. The Twitter ecosystem is comfortable with the idea of sites creating profiles based on their Twitter identity (see twittercounter, klout and hundreds of others) without them first having interacted with the site. If we did that against LinkedIn or Facebook accounts the response would be very different.<p>On top of that, Twitter is absolutely the social network most associated with our kinds of events. Conference backchannels happen on Twitter, and many speakers include their Twitter name on the first slides in their presentations. It's a very good fit.<p>So while we plan to move beyond Twitter at some point, so far it has served us extremely well.",1305227641

6962829,comment,6962045,6962238,17,0,Theodores,,,"Actually I think that quite a few offices would have met with his approval. It is not a choice between grey cubes and zany beanbag chairs + silly toys, there are other factors.<p>I spent a while working for the UK civil service - the ultimate in &#x27;grey&#x27;! However, our office was above an aquarium, our research was in oceanography and, as a consequence, we had an amazing foyer (the public aquarium) with a fantastic view out to sea overlooking the harbour (probably the best view in town). The hallways had fish-tanks in them complete with fish that were neither to eat or for decoration, there were &#x27;bits of boat&#x27; lying around plus all kinds of sea-going instrumentation. There were plants too, not the sort you get from the garden centre, but I never paid attention to them enough to find out what they were there for. Amongst all of this fun-looking stuff there was a pretty big machine room and half the people there were purely computing staff.<p>Importantly all of it was the real deal. None of it was fake, just purchased to give some novelty ambience to the office. It all had purpose, but fun was allowed too, within reason. Hallways would have plenty of interesting pictures, you know, the team at the base in the Antarctic, some satellite imagery of an algae bloom, that sort of stuff.<p>There are plenty of other offices that have some amazing ambience to them. Television production facilities are another example, where there are zany fake things but they are props used for some show or other. Even relatively humble factories making things like cardboard boxes can have cool offices attached, overlooking the factory floor.<p>The problem I have with Google style offices is that it is entirely fake. The distractions would drive me mad. Everyone knows it is fake. At the same time there is something sick about totally grey cubicles, i.e. with a tech company that just sells software. So, what to do with an IT company that has no &#x27;fascinating product&#x27; made on site?<p>Some inspiration can be found in the Maclaren Technology Centre. This is where the Maclaren F1 cars come from. Sure they have plenty of F1 cars lying around, however, the building has some ethos to it - attention to detail, supreme cleanliness and an air of excellence. It is a complete contrast to your typical car garage. None of it is fake, although I am sure the &#x27;OCD&#x27; could drive you mad.<p>Inspiration can also be drawn from places like Europe where tech companies have taken space in areas that were once used for other things. The character of the old industry - e.g. a dockside building or mill - is inherited and you have something that is repurposed rather than faked.<p>Anyway, I like to think that there are plenty of office spaces that aren&#x27;t Google cheesy or grey cubicles but something with character born out of heritage or instilled from some company ethos.",1387971391

6962821,comment,6961824,6961824,10,0,belgianguy,,,"Patent reform is highly needed or patents risk to become nothing more than minefields that already established players will use to stall - and ultimately defeat - newcomers and innovation in general, rather than dissemination of information and furthering of the sciences. Software projects (especially Open Source) projects that get popular don&#x27;t stand a chance against these trolls.\nDon&#x27;t think this is just something we need to read about.<p>Action is required.<p>At the moment Google/Android are being attacked by Rockstar Bidco, the Patent Troll King. It owns >6000 (ex-Nortel) patents, which (Microsoft, Apple, Sony, RIM and Ericsson bought jointly) they all stuffed into the Rockstar Bidco company that has no other function than suing possible &#x27;infringers&#x27;. Given the vagueness and fondness of the USPTO to &#x27;create intellectual property&#x27;, this could be the perfect patent storm and Rockstar&#x27;s boss said it himself: &#x27;Pretty much anybody out there is infringing&#x27;. Meaning that whatever gets into the crosshairs of Rockstar, is on the hook for possibly millions of dollars.\nWho can defeat a titanic patent Frankenstein as big as Rockstar Bidco? It cannot be sued because it produces nothing (aka an Non Practicing Entity). But it has enormous wealthy backers, so it can sue everyone for everything and just sit it out. In fact, its owners all hold patents on the mobile industry, so the &#x27;urgency&#x27; and &#x27;usefulness&#x27; of Rockstar could be questioned, outside of being a &#x27;bigger stick to hit Android with&#x27;. Google or the Android manufacturers have no option but to face the lawsuits.<p>Google will have a hard time fighting them off, but I don&#x27;t see the Android manufacturers survive in one piece. And that&#x27;s exactly the idea: eradicate Android, make all software development that isn&#x27;t owned (or graced) by the Rockstar owners a sticky patent mess, leading to a small set of &#x27;friends of Rockstar&#x27; who can afford to develop software in peace. That&#x27;s not only bad for Android or Google, that&#x27;s a bad sign for software development in general.<p>Because what if Rockstar Bidco all of the sudden &#x27;feels&#x27; that the SteamBox could threaten the Xbox/Playstation duopoly? What if Rockstar Bidco thinks that Ubuntu Phone OS is something that is in infringing on their phone software patents? Who will stand up for them? Of course Rockstar Bidco claims that they are independent, but that was only believed by fools when they formed and only idiots believe it now after the other shoe has dropped (Apple, RIM and Microsoft all attacking Google/Android).<p>And to the supporters of Rockstar, just to be clear: Google was only invited for a jointly bid on the Novell patents, never on the Nortel patents. As per the legal counsel of Google:<p>Microsoft’s objective has been to keep from Google and Android device-makers any patents that might be used to defend against their attacks. A joint acquisition of the Novell patents that gave all parties a license would have eliminated any protection these patents could offer to Android against attacks from Microsoft and its bidding partners. Making sure that we would be unable to assert these patents to defend Android — and having us pay for the privilege — must have seemed like an ingenious strategy to them.<p>In short: Microsoft told them it was going to shoot their dog but offered them to hold the gun when they did it.<p>The fact that so many frivolous software patents exist is bad enough, the fact that 5 of the biggest tech companies conspired to create the ultimate patent troll is outright disgusting.<p>Hate Android/Google all you like, but such constructions aren&#x27;t healthy for a competitive market, they&#x27;ll just swallow more and more patents, and attack more and more companies, until nobody bothers because of relentless lawsuits as soon as something somewhat popular is produced.<p>No developer will sleep easy at night when this becomes the default, as an NPE is like a ghost, not subject to the same attacks as a regular business, which makes it so much harder to defeat.<p>If software can only be developed by the graces or whims of companies like Rockstar Bidco, the software industry will bleed to death in an instant.",1387970773

6962812,comment,6962329,6962755,4,0,jrockway,,,"I think the problem is that Snapchat is significantly less complex than a video game.  With a video game, a cheater might benefit from something like removing the fog of war.  So the server can just calculate that itself, and not tell you about things your client can&#x27;t see.  This makes cheating more difficult.  (But of course, the game needs to be fast, so sometimes you have to give the client more information than it should display.  In this space, room for undetectable exploits exist, and so there is a lot of complexity like spyware that reads /proc/mem to check if you&#x27;re cheating.  Or so they say, I&#x27;ve never read the source code...)<p>I&#x27;ve never used Snapchat, but from what I understand Snapchat basically sends people pictures with a time limit for looking at them.  At that point, the client has perfect information, and it&#x27;s up to the client to stop displaying the picture and remove it from system RAM, swap, CPU cache, GPU memory, and so on with 100% reliability after that timer expires, or the whole app is pointless.  Since that&#x27;s impossible unless you control every aspect of the system and encase it in self-destructing epoxy, the system is mostly pointless.  (In that sense, it&#x27;s like DRM.  If you can view it, you can copy it.)<p>My understanding is that this is mostly used for sexting, which begs for me to ask this question: why are you sending naked pictures of yourself to someone you don&#x27;t trust with naked pictures of yourself?  Maybe work on those human relationships rather than outsourcing trust to some random company?  Get off my lawn. Wheeze.",1387970246

There is a lot of non-sense floating on the internet about the language, but I suggest making up your own mind.<p>Tooling and IDE support is better than Haskell and Clojure, so you can focus on the language instead of fighting with tools.<p>If you know Scala a bit, it&#x27;s easy to move to something else. For instance, if you decide that you don&#x27;t need types, you can move to Clojure; if you decide you don&#x27;t need unchecked side-effects you can move to Haskell; if you decide that you don&#x27;t need functional programming, you can move to a different OOP language (or keep using Scala).",1387969755

I was surprised by how easy it was to decompile the Android app:<p><pre><code>  public static boolean NEEDS_FUCKED_UP_NEXUS_422_SETTINGS()\n\n  Timber.d(&quot;Looks like camprevs gon hide dis shit&quot;, new Object[0]);\n</code></pre>\nThere really is no way for the Snapchat team to completely prevent others from reversing their API. A client is the endpoint after all. In order to make things difficult for hackers, they could do the following:\n1. Implement a custom protocol over TCP/IP, kind of what Skype does.\n2. Obfuscate the hell out of it and everything else.\n3. Roll out new updates with both APIs.\n4. After a reasonable amount of time, break backwards-compatibility on server side.",1387969638

I think spending time family is a good thing, regardless if it&#x27;s holiday or not. Try to set apart some difference, at least spend a bit of time, like have dinner together and such.<p>Never mind the rest of the world as it carries about what was the holiday about anyway? Some dude that was born, grew up to be crucified, defies the laws of universe and physics to rise up from the dead?<p>I don&#x27;t hate Christmas but I pretty much regard it like any other day of the year.

5561705,comment,5560692,5560692,1,0,ggchappell,,,"An interesting discussion.<p>I'm wondering about some of the reasoning, though. For example:<p>> On top of all this extra power being used, we have targets to meet on reducing emissions. That means shutting down coal fired power plants, reducing our gas usage, and moving to cleaner sources such as wind, solar, wave, geothermal, and dare I say it, nuclear. How are we going to meet demand?<p>Are we actually trying to reduce emissions here, or just meeting someone's target for shutting down coal-fired plants? It's my understanding that a typical coal-fired plant produces around 500 megawatts. That's 12 million kWh each day. You quote a figure of 8kWh to charge an electric car. If that 8kWh is needed every day, then your coal plant gives you the ability to keep 1.5 million cars charged. If that 8kWh is <i>not</i> needed every day, then you get even more cars for the deal.<p>Now, shut down that coal-fired plant and replace 1.5 million (or more!) electric cars with fuel-burning cars. Have you reduced overall emissions? I'm not sure; but I think it is likely you haven't.<p>> Maybe we should all go out and buy electric cars. We will experience brownouts, electricity prices will soar, and it will be difficult. But hopefully it will start some change.<p>Or perhaps <i>some</i> of us should buy electric cars. As the number of such cars grows, electricity prices start rising. and then two things happen: (1) demand for electric cars drops, and (2) pressure from the public makes it likely that power-generation capacity increases. And then prices drop, and more people buy electric cars .... So I don't really see the need for a gloom-and-doom forecast.<p>In any case, as I said, an interesting piece. Please do more of them.",1366156611

All layers are correct, but most won't be useful for a given problem.<p>If you're thinking about, say, crowd reactions, then you don't want the ""meatbag"" model. Instead, you need a higher-level psychological model. However, if your problem is ""what kind of injuries result from a bomb"", then the ""meatbag"" model is right on.<p>Thinking of the body as a loose confederation of fundamental particles is fairly useless when trying to decide how much to charge for a product, but it's an <i>excellent</i> model when e.g. figuring out how much radiation a person will absorb from a source.<p>No layer denies the usefulness or reality of any of the others.",1366156501

I think I answered your question elsewhere, and so failed to get to the email followup.<p>The Belenko and Sklyorov analysis of a large number of password managers found that many of them (including 1Password) were vulnerable to a ""padding oracle"" attack.<p>We discussed the problem the day that the report came out, and released an update to 1Password for iOS (Mac and Windows versions were not affected) within a few weeks.<p>The specific vulnerability (that pretty much affected everyone who used the standard cryptographic libraries) is fascinating, and I'm hoping to write more about it some day.  But for the moment, please see<p><a href=""http://blog.agilebits.com/2012/11/08/dont-trust-a-password-management-system-you-design-yourself/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.agilebits.com/2012/11/08/dont-trust-a-password-m...</a><p>which includes some links to the issue and what we did about it.  The key paragraph is<p>""The [New York Times] article cites some of the research behind Elcomsofts scathing review (PDF) of password managers on mobile devices, which we wrote about last March. That report did included some issues in 1Password on iOS (which we quickly addressed), but it also shows that there is enormous variation in the quality of password managers. 1Password is clearly among the best.""<p>It is hard to stay ahead of potential threats, and we slipped up in that case so had to play ""catch up"" instead.  Although there was never a practical threat to people's data, as developing a practical tool to exploit the vulnerability would take some time. But the design flaw certainly opened the door for people to create such tools, so we did need to get this fixed quickly.<p>Still we try to look toward the future in our design and defend against potential threats that don't yet exist. We should have defended against all potential chosen ciphertext attacks (CCAs) no matter how ""theoretical"" before the padding oracle (a type of CCA attack) was actually discovered.<p>I hope that helps.

Basically computing the discount rate for a STEM degree in terms of forward earnings potential. Consider a technical degree with a starting salary of 75K going to 150K in year 10. With a linear progression that is basically about $1.0875M in salary over 10 years. 10% of that would be $108,750. Lets make the face value $100K, The question being what discount rate would you need to offer a bond at that matured in 10 years? 10 year treasuries [1] are currently at not quite 2%, junk bonds might be 6 - 7%. So at the low end we sell our bonds for $85K, pay them off in 10 years at $100K for an approximate 2% annual yield. But at 7% you have to sell them at $50K for an annual yield of 7%. So depending on how risky investors in this persons bonds considered them, would affect the discount rate for them. Then you could bundle these bonds into tranches and sell off the high end as treasury equivalent and the low end as a more speculative investment :-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/in...</a>",1366154175

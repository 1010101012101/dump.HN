1592943,comment,1590955,1591579,0,0,nanairo,,,"Exactly. The Ruby community likes to experiment and it's a bit hyperactive. Personally I quite like it because of that.<p>That said the article was a bit of a stretch both in the example it used, and in particular the fact that the Ruby world is currently undergoing a big shift. I would imagine one year from now a lot of those choices will be gone (e.g. Ruby 1.9.1 or even 1.8.x, Rails 2.x and maybe some of the less popular Ruby implementations).<p>But the general principle is correct: the Ruby community likes to try, change, play with new frameworks and ideas. If you hate the principle, then maybe Ruby is not for you. Or maybe in true Open source philosophy, you can make a simpler installer, or get someone else to do it. Then you'd have made the Ruby world a better place, and we'd all thank you for it. :)",1281473958

If that's the case then it may be time to find a J.O.B. and put this on the sideburner.  If you have faith in it, have collected plenty of positive feedback, and have interested parties lined up to use it, then there's nothing wrong with going to earn a paycheck to take care of your basic needs first.  It may take longer but it may also refocus you on the tasks at hand.<p>That... or go get some angel funding.  There are more incubators/angels than just PG.  How about family?

1592925,comment,1589207,1590792,0,0,jpp,,,"""Printing cost"" is probably too loosy-goosey a term. Perhaps the better sentence would have been: ""I would guess—but do not know—that he will not make much of a profit off the sales of the book itself.""<p>What surprised me with my book was just how much distribution and storage costs add up. Without getting into exact numbers, the printing costs themselves can be less than those costs, not even factoring in amortized costs. The comments that look at the per-page printing cost (2,400 / 400 = $0.16 / page) leave that out.<p>What would make more sense to me in this case would be the potential intellectual property (patents) that could come about from doing the research for such a book. Regardless, from my conversation from him, it's clear he loves the topic (as do I) and looks at it as a way to contribute to the world. In his case, it just happens to be a business expense as well.<p>Fwiw, authors really don't make that much money on books, excluding the very few at the top of the bestseller list. Nathan put it best: ""How to make a small fortune writing a book: First, you start with a large fortune, then...""

I've done both, and the ""any jobs"" were not worth it other than learning that the ""any job"" was not what I wanted to do.  ""No job"" offers a lot of non-monetary benefits like free time, flexibility, friends and community.  I stopped feeling desperate that I needed to have a job, and I let go of major things in my life that cost money:  rented sleep space, and most store-bought food.  ""No job"" is probably not for everyone, or maybe ""no job"" looks totally different for you.

1592920,comment,1592074,1592672,0,0,terra_t,,,"For a long time,  Google ads were entirely contextual:  they served up ads based on the content of your page.<p>Contextual ads work well on a site for which the text is predictive of what ads will make money;  for instance,  in the case of a car forum,  you can figure out what kind of cars are being talked about,  if they are fixing up drivers,  if they are racing,  whatever.<p>Contextual ads work poorly on sites (like Facebook) that aren't really about any topic in particular -- because the text isn't predictive of anything.  Also,  in some cases,  you can predict accurately what ads are likely to make a profit,  but the profit isn't much.<p>Behavioral ads to the rescue -- the ad network sticks a cookie on your and tracks your interests over the long term.  Although contextual ads are (overall) better targeted,  a network like Adsense that does both can guess which will perform best for a particular impression,  raising earnings for publishers and the networks.<p>Behavioral ads take many forms,  but my favorite form right now are ones that are integrated with the shopping process.  For instance,  if you spend some time on Zappos,  you might find ads for Zappos on other sites that feature the sort of products you were looking at.  (Right now I'm thinking about what the next Gamecube RPG I'm going to buy next,  so it would be logical for AMZN to try to tempt me to close the deal)<p>Anyway,  Google added behavioral targeting and third party ad networks a few months ago -- publishers don't need to do anything special to benefit...  we just get bigger checks!",1281473483

Why is anyone mad at Google over this Verizon thing?<p>Is Verizon <i>so</i> evil that just talking to them about the future of networks is enough for Google to be evil by association?  (Actually, don't answer that.)<p>The argument in this article is that Google touches every part of the internet, and you can't live without their services even if you wanted to, because they're so widespread.  I can accept that, but wouldn't that also mean that Google has an interest in a free and neutral internet, because their services are so widespread?<p>The very core of Google's business is derived from indexing all of the content on the internet.  Their stated goal is to ""index all the world's data"".  How exactly would cutting back-room deals for special traffic shaping with Verizon help Google?<p>Verizon, however, has a serious interest in preventing competition.  They mostly sell network access at a premium price, which they can only do because they've gone to great lengths to limit the choices available to consumers.<p>Verizon seeks to limit access to consumers, while Google seeks to broker access between the user and whatever data they're searching for.<p>The more Verizon can stifle the competition and trap users, the more secure their business is.  Google, however, is made more secure by every piece of user-contributed content that gets created.  When Google indexes a new website, Google is increasing in value.  When a user uploads to Youtube, Google is increasing in value.  When someone makes a phone call with Google Voice, Google is increasing in value.<p>I can imagine Google providing internet access, but could you imagine Verizon providing Google-like data indexing services for public use?  Remember that Google killed the phone book.  We take it for granted now, but that's hugely significant.  Verizon should be terrified of them providing cheap wireless communication, but Google need not be terrified of Verizon competing in the data indexing space.<p>Verizon needs to be a successful network access provider, and Google wants to be the hub for all data on the network.

It's not clear whether you notified anybody, but it sounds like the work was billable until you decided to abandon it - which means your participation had to be replaced or written off, both of which are a bit expensive.<p>2. You don't know when you'll reach point X with the SEM project, and all you have been promised when you do reach it is an audition to ask for capital investment.<p>3. You have almost run out of cash because you spent it on stuff like an iPhone 4 when it was flowing, and are probably eating nothing but junk food.<p>It sounds like you're immersing yourself in dealing with the problems of coding in order to avoid dealing with the less tractable problems of money, personal interaction, and working pattern.

I said this before, and after nearly a month I am even more convinced, the lowly back button is the most significant architectural advantage for Android.<p>To me (a Droid user since day 1), the back button and the whole workflow of launching other apps from within an original app started off as something I liked, but it's kind of a strange concept.  When it works well (open a browser from an app, press back, and you're back in the original app), it's really nice, but sometimes these nested apps get a bit confusing. For instance: open a link from a Twitter client, and it brings you to the browser. Hit home, and then open the browser. Personally, I would expect to go to the link the Twitter client sent you to. However, this is nowhere to be found, instead you're at the last page you used the browser directly for.<p>I've become used to this, but it really isn't that intuitive for new users.  I've handed my phone to my mom, and she's definitely had issues with where the back button is taking her.<p>Also, I've noticed a few games that don't implement the back button, and pressing it, rather than doing what you'd expect (bringing you a pause screen, the game's menu, etc.), it dumps you on the home screen.

A bank president knows that if they spend $X million they'll get a new building, with high probability. There may be some problems along the way but they for sure won't end up spending $X million on nothing, or on a cardboard box with a ""BANK"" sign written in crayon on the side.

By far the most important tier in the proposal is called ""the Internet"".  If history is any indication, ""the little guy"" is guaranteed to out innovate, time and time again.  And as a result the service people will care about most will be called ""the Internet"".<p>Sure, Verizon is free to prioritize traffic so that telephone calls don't get dropped and people's TV works even when a DoS attack is going on.  But neither Verizon nor any other provider can afford to make the internet suck, and as long as it doesn't suck the guy in the garage is free to deliver what we haven't dreamed of yet.<p>Don't forget, we've seen the tiered internet before.  It is what broad access started with in the mid-90s where services like AOL and Juno had their nice little walled gardens and, on the side, offered access to the big scary internet.  And guess what?  The walled gardens weren't attractive to consumers then, and won't be now.<p>So if the utilities go along with this agreement then breathe a big sigh of relief, and get on with your lives.

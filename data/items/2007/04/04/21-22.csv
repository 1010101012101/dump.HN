8921,comment,8909,8909,0,0,floozyspeak,,,"I think being exposed to the great ocean makes you want to swim in it.  Once you get exposed you want to dabble in it, play around with it, retool yerself to meld with it.  Its also a bit like enabling niches.  We all like little niches that do things for us, communicate better or more to our satisfaction, help us express ourselves, cast our line into the ocean o data.  <p>",1175723787

It's is problem everyone is having, and everyone knew it (<a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/lazybackup"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/lazybackup</a> ). If it really works as well as it looks in that demo then they nailed it. I'm both envious and inspired. I'll be surprised if YC does not fund them. ",1175723293

They aren't thinking about Whitespace, or color choices. They're thinking about content. They're thinking about how to add Foo, not how it will look.<p><p>As a application provider (Like so many of us are or want to be) it's our job to abstract design, and let people focus on content, which what they care about in the first place.<p>\nIf users aren't going to think about design, but they are going to feel bad if you don't have it, they you have three choices-<p>1) Ignore the problem. This is what MySpace and GeoCities do- They let the user upload whatever they want, no matter how it might look. The users focus on content rather on the looks. They'll complain about it, and you'll ""lose points"" with them, but they get to have all the widgets they want. <p>2) Force most users to display it your way, or have experts modify it. This is what WordPress, Drupal, and other CMS do. The default templates look decent, and editing them is hard for mere mortals, requiring HTML or Scripting.  Creating new templates may be technically possible, but beyond the scope of most users<p>3) Make the user's content look GOOD. This is what Wufoo does with forms, and Apple's iWeb does for webpages. It lets you add the content, but it adds its own design special-sauce. This is the model that we should be shooting for for our Web Apps. How can we make the User's content look good?\n",1175722863

3389782,comment,3388893,3389562,0,0,stevecooperorg,,,"Isn't his point rather that Lisp goes beyond the normal definition of 'programming language'?<p>""Lisp is almost an interpreter builder rather than just an interpreter/compiler""<p>So most languages have a fixed grammar, and programs are always written in that grammar. Java functions, whatever problems they have, are at least always declared using a fixed grammar -- something like<p><pre><code>    function ::= returnType Identifier parameterList;\n</code></pre>\nSo even if you don't know what a function <i>does</i>, at least you (and tools) can easily see functions in the source code. The same applies to loops, classes, conditionals, etc. (Same for python, BASIC, whatever.) What Lisp does goes beyond that; I can define a new conditional language construct, or looping grammar, or object system...<p>""This means that one can make it be just about anything they want. Thus, its culture is almost a lack of culture.""<p>The fear is that you'll end up having to join a project using ""Dave's Object System"" or ""Nora's Conditionals Library"". And that's where Lisp has the Aw(esome|ful) power to write in wildly divergent styles -- in fact, written in whole new grammars.<p>I suppose there's an idea that code can be written in a 'natural' way for the language. So you have this idea in python programming of something being 'pythonic' -- not just corresponding to the the python grammar, but also in a particular, respected programming idiom. So the question is, when you have the power to write your own grammar, can you then still write in a good, predicatable style that makes the code a good form of communication for other programmers? Is there a 'lispish' way to write code? (I suppose the same question applies to things like internal Ruby DSLs.)<p>Honest questions; although I've given Lisp a good shot, I've never written anything longer than a few hundred lines...",1324763345

In java, I can reason as follows: the Java Dependency Injection Framework is gigantic and convoluted, therefore it is going to be complex and difficult to manage.<p>In Java there is a sort of ceiling, one might call it an upper bound on the mindfuckery per square inch of code. In 100 dense lines of lisp, there is no a priori reason to assume that no one has written a recursive descent macro-expanding s-expression handler for arbitrary routing of network packets in a rules-based DSL. In the same amount of dense java code there are rarely more than 200 method calls, all statically checked, and rarely more than 100 variables, typed and scoped.<p>From John Carmack's recent article on static checking: ""If you have a large enough codebase, any class of error that is syntactically legal probably exists there."" Now, he is concerned with actual defects, but the same rules apply even more strongly for stylistic rules. As the size of a codebase increases, the probability that any particular language feature is absent approaches zero. And in a language like lisp, where you can write your own language features, this is moderately horrifying.<p>The fact that you can replicate java's dependency injection in a few orders of magnitude less code in lisp is not a comfort to me. Because the 10,000 lines of code in Java's Dependency Injection Framework is a red flag to me. The chances that someone who writes the same thing in lisp has drastically simplified the implementation are not so high.",1324761886

The likelihood of a letter-writing campaign either getting off the ground of making an impressive impact is much slimmer than usual.<p>Meanwhile, a very particular company is identified as supportive of the legislation. It happens that their product is broadly used by the Internet community and that said product provides recurring revenue. The loss of numerous customers, as a result, has lasting impact.<p>And so the community responds and makes an example of this company. Do angels sing, heralding the end of bad legislation? No. But tech news outlets, which would have had nothing substantial to print, now get to focus their full attention again on SOPA, on how a company who supports it is brutally punished, and how the Internet business community is maybe something not to be fucked with after all. So now this is part of the story: Internet folk have teeth, there are consequences for supporting bad law. The best part is that GoDaddy doesn't even have to be wounded in any real sense  the story is enough to change the tone of the conversation.

They are incentivized to freak you out and make you scare of the world so you'll keep buying their research. I was just at a conference where a guy from one risk firm claimed that there was a 60% chance of an attack by the US/Israel on Iran. But he had no real systematic process at work and no track record of making accurate positions, so it's tough to probability weight that kind of scenario from an investor's perspective.<p>I don't think it's the greatest way to try to make money, but I can understand that guys that are investing in very oil specific/security sensitive plays, this kind of research could add a bit incremental value.",1324760857

I reflect, I have to understand the need for the problem in the first place before I can even begin to solve it. Due to this I also lock up when someone asks me a memorization question. You can ask me something as simple as ""hey what was that guys name?"" I can know the person for a decade and by the very nature of being asked to recall it on the spot will cause me to blank. It's not the way my mind works. As such I generally decline to do quizzes for interviews, because I don't think they increase the the odds of hiring talent and worse they can cause a company to damage itself via a bias for a particular personality type.<p>If a person brings in a working application and shows me that they have delivered and can walk me through logic that they have created, then I can get a feel for a variate of traits that that person posses, further, they can't BS their way through it, they can't grab code off the net and show it and competently tell me what they did. A person that walks through my door and shows me that they have delivered to production a working application instantly scores much higher than an individual that knows obscure language nuances that we all know on this board are hardly ever uses and if you do you a) look it up and b) wrap it behind an API so that future programmers are not having to deal with the obscurity. Many times developers, especially younger developers mistake cleverness for elegance, testing for cleverness does not guarantee that you will have elegant solutions.<p>On a related note to this subject, there is a quote from Einstein that I really like:<p><i>Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.</i><p>The premise is that most everybody does have something that they excel at, but that we as humans judge intelligence and productivity in our own image. As such we discount the intelligence of others due to the fact that it is alien to our own. For some that discounting can have a profound effect on those individuals ability to excel.",1324760750

It is commonly known that while people of color have souls, which are energy, the white man has only an essence of a soul, a souls shadow, so to speak.

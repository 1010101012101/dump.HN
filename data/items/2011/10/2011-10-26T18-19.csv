3159937,comment,3159644,3159918,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"The problem here is that there is a larger political argument, which I acknowledge but really don't want to participate in, which goes something like <i>college only exists to indoctrinate young liberals.</i> As you can see from one of the other commenters on this article, people take it like that whether I mean it that way or not.<p>I find this statement to be true, but an oversimplification, and it's not my point at all. I think what we're really seeing is a sociological phenomenon: teaching people to appear as if they've learned something instead of actually teaching them anything. I find this deeper point to be much more important. You might find the same thing at right-leaning universities -- perhaps. (Although there is an interesting inverse relationship on the right. Perhaps at right-leaning universities you would find students who pose as tolerant and worldly yet have no idea why they do so? It bears study.)<p>Not an excuse for not doing a rewrite, but I wanted to point out that there is a fine line here, hence the ""I'm not saying"" text. (Still needs a rewrite. Your point is well made. Thank you.)",1319655576

Amongst the many mistakes Microsoft made with Vista, first and foremost was allowing the bloat to get so bad that it wouldn't run at all on machines that ran XP quite happily. Later Windows 7 could actually run on those old XP machines with many, if not most, of the features that Vista bragged about.<p>So here we have Google, arguably a company which can hire all of the worlds best engineers, why are they succumbing to the code first and ask questions later philosophy that gave Microsoft such heartburn?<p>Andy, I know you read HN, tell the team that their bonus depends on Android 4.0 being runnable on a Nexus 1. It isn't about supporting the platform with the least market share of any Android phone, its about instilling in the team a philosphy that taking the time to run great on hardware of that capability pays huge dividends in the phone world.<p>Many engineers today were brought up in a world where the next PC will be 1.5 - 2x the 'size' of the current PC so bloat is fine, schedule is king. This is a bad philosophy in the embedded space. That 1.5 - 2x the 'size' phone means you can't cut your phone costs, you can't grow your market, you are stuck waiting only the latest / greatest chips which are always in short supply to ship volume. Help those engineers break the habit, I know they can they are smart folks. Challenge them, as Ben Horowitz would say use your lead bullets on this one.",1319653316

That is why tail call is an optimization you can perform when there are no other operations after the tail call.  You can jump to the next instruction and be done with it.<p>But if the tail call is in a try-finally block the ""tail call"" is not actually the tail.  There is more code that needs to be run after the execution of the tail call.  The code has to return back from the tail call and execute the finally code.<p>What you thought was a tail call is actually no longer a tail call at all.",1319652447

This is partially based on my own engineering experience, but in terms of the smartphone market I see WP7 (and to a lesser extent Palm) and see touch phone experiences that are significantly different than what Apple developed/evolved with iOS (although it is true that some of the implementation details like pinch-to-zoom are present there as well, but other details are different).<p>There is no universal axiom that says that a smartphone experience has to look like an iPhone.

He was pretty oblivious to the fact he was at a graduation, and not at any point in his speech did he address the students and their future.  All he talked about was free software, how copyright was bad, and that the university should be using free software.  Most of the students were pretty pissed off at him because he ruined one of the most significant moments in their life.  He didn't even say, congratulations well done on graduating, or even a simple ""hello."" He only spoke about free software.<p>I think the video is still up on the university's website somewhere.

This could be a nice home business, OK, I'm convinced.",1325232583

Unfortunately, as my local cinema no longer has a projectionist and no staff are apparently watching the movie people talk, they text.. some even get up and run around. I don't bother going much now.<p>I was watching the Harry Potter part 8 movie and teens came with their dad. They talked on and off for the first half of the film.  Their dad did nothing. It wasn't until I turned around in my seat and told them to shut up that they actually did.<p>Flash back about 10 years. Maybe a bit more. There was a projectionist. There was often a staff member sitting by the entrance of the movie. Some kids would mess around. The staff would wait to see if it settled down for a minute or so then a flash light would come on and out would go the talkers.<p>I forget what film it was but there were 4 major distractions where staff had to come in and order people out. As we left staff members apologised and handed out vouchers because they knew the screening had been ruined.<p>I don't mind people gasping or saying ""Oh no he didn't!"" during scary films. There have always been idiots at the cinema. They have only started ruining films of late because cinemas have lost the will to deal with these people.",1325232498

The people releasing it are presumably <i>the ones who stole it in the first place.</i> In a bank robbery, do you blame the manufacturer of the safe that was cracked?

No, the <i>perpetrators of the crime</i> are at fault.<p>Even if <i>I</i> agreed with you on who was at fault here (which I clearly don't), do you think any significant number of victims of this leak will honestly blame Stratfor more than they blame the hackers behind the attack?

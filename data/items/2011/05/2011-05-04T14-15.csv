Quebecois thought Layton did great in the French-language debate, wanted him as PM, and voted for whatever NDP was on their ballot locally.  This resulted in oddities like a monolingual Anglophone being elected in a riding that is 80 percent monolingual Francophone.  A mixed-member proportional system like they have in Germany would fix this -- you have separate votes for who you want to be your local rep and who you want to control the government.",1304521157

Content creators should have a right to decide how their content is disseminated - whether it's sold, shared for free, given free for noncommercial use, kept private, etc. The author should be able to make this decision. If someone writes an e-book, they should be perfectly welcome to give it away for free. And if they choose to charge money for it, that decision should be respected too.<p>Of course there are always ways to get around the author's decision (read: thepiratebay.org), and if digital restrictions are onerous, people will do that.

* Android gains dramatically on iPhone as developers regular mobile browsing platform
There is a correlation between the devices and platforms developers use, and those they develop for.
* Web site testing across a wide range of mobile devices jumps significantly.
* JQuery Mobile leads from JQTouch and SenchaTouch in a still immature mobile frameworks market place.
* Three quarters of respondents expressed an interest in developing native apps using web technologies in the coming year, with 30% likely to do so.
* iPhone, iPad, along with Android phones and tablets all show strong interest from developers, while other platforms have their work cut out to woo web developers.
* Web developers express confidence in developing native apps using HTML5, with reservations about application performance and user experience.",1304519879

This was the observation in 1965 by the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore (pictured at the Intel Museum in 2005) that the number of transistors that could be crammed onto a chip doubles and the size of those chips tended to shrink as manufacturing technology improved on a fairly regular basis: About every 18 to 24 months.""<p>Moore's observation was that the density yielding the minimum cost per transistor doubled with each generation (which doesn't actually predict that the density itself will double, only the point at the bottom of the cost curve will move to 2x density), not that the density doubled or that everything got 2x MOAR AWESUM in some random way.<p>Yes, it's sad, but it's true.

2513856,comment,2513174,2513820,3,0,mononcqc,,,"What you need to do then is look into a few different options.<p>The first one is distributed Applications. This is part of the standard OTP stuff. What this does is declare a node as a master, and then failover nodes for your OTP application. When your master goes down, the other nodes take over it. Whenever the master is back, the failover nodes drop their applications and restarts it on the master. This loses all of the state if it hasn't been kept in a safe place.<p>Another one is to look at gen_leader. gen_leader is not part of OTP, but has been written by Ulf Wiger and is available on github or through agner. A quick description of it would simply be to say that it's a boosted gen_server that will find a master of itself somewhere and automatically replicate its data everywhere else. If the master dies, a leader election occurs and a new one takes over.<p>A third option is to have a masterless concept. This is what happens in Riak. Data has to be shared in clever ways and code organized to support such a design. Nobody's a master, everyone's a follower. You add redundancy here and there, push important state to a safe spot, etc. In the standard library, modules such as 'global' handles this kind of thing.<p>Supervisors are not exactly made to cross node boundaries. They protect your local processes. If you need something more complex to keep your state alive, this usually happens at a higher level for OTP.",1304517969

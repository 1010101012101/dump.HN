1260887,comment,1260748,1260798,0,0,danudey,,,"Unlikely. Opera Mini works by doing all the rendering on the server-side, and then sending the pre-rendered website to the client. It's not actually a browser, so much as an app that gets screenshots from a server-side browser.<p>Firefox, on the other hand, would be a real browser, running Javascript rendering and Gecko on the phone itself, which would not be allowed.<p>That said, I don't understand why anyone would want Firefox anyway. The iPhone's limited memory and CPU would likely make Firefox nearly unusable, while extensions would eat away at what little free space was left. Firefox isn't optimized for the mobile space, and I can't think of any features it would provide that would make it a better choice than Safari (or, on Android, the built-in WebKit browser).",1271120332

You don't tend to get this in face-to-face settings, where we rely a lot more on context, facial expression, voice tone, and body language.  A lot of people comment that I write well.  (And my sister, a journalism major who used to edit my school papers, eventually began turning to me for editing suggestions.)  I learned it in online forums.  Good communication skills are fairly uncommon and quite valuable for getting things done.",1271120303

1260876,comment,1258815,1260671,0,0,moron4hire,,,"But namespaces are just more data. Namespaces, in my experience, have just turned into a hurdle that requires a bunch of needless element decoration to get it to play nice with XPath. The only place I know of where there is great confusion over what ""XML"" document you're processing is a browser trying to decide what type of document it's working with, i.e. all of the various versions of HTML and XHTML. That's not an argument for namespacing, that's an argument against forking markup languages. In every case where I've built XML processing services, I always knew what the purpose of the document was ahead of time.<p>Then there's XML Schema. In practice, I doubt few people actually validate documents against an XSD, in the rare cases one actually existed. Have you ever tried writing a reasonable sized XSD? Why are attributes treated differently from elements with a single text node as a child? Why can't I specify that a certain attribute is a prerequisite for another? Why are we specifying document structure and default values at the same time? What safety is type information actually giving me if I have to validate in my consuming service anyway?<p>I've had to process XML documents that claimed to be of such-and-such standard schema, and it invariably turns out untrue. There's always some 11pm job that fails to validate a doc because the author added an extra attribute or misspelled one you don't care about. Eventually, you just turn validation off and start doing things much more dynamically. I've always had to infer the schema from the document itself, otherwise my apps were too rigid for real-world use.<p>Someone else mentioned that S-exprs would need an intelligent editor to make writing them more coherent. I personally think the same is true for XML, as reasonably large (i.e. anything beyond tutorial demonstrations) XML documents will have the same problem of guessing what tags are already closed and which order they should be closed in, if only because their openings have scrolled off the top of the screen. Sure, you know you're closing a DIV tag right now, <i>but which one</i>? How long did it take to get decent XML syntax validation? While your Lisp interpreter has been sitting there quietly for the last 60 years. Throw in validation against namespacing and schema, and you still need an intelligent editor either way.<p>I don't really buy that XML is human readable, either. You don't read a 5000 line XML document, there's nothing to be gained from reading raw XML in that case (even if you have a raw text editor that can handle the file size). XML might have a slight advantage with being easier to demonstrate for new people learning, but once you get into actually using these tools, you don't ever use them in the ""human readable/editable"" format. That'd be like managing your finances with nothing but text files.<p>I'm just saying, Lisp was already well understood and parsed by the time XML was invented, and even XML + XSLT isn't even on parity with Lisp. Namespacing and XML Schema just turn out to be conventions that people say they're going to try to adhere to, but never do. Like I said, just like speed limits on roads.",1271120024

1260785,comment,1260562,1260562,0,0,rjurney,,,"Sorry, not sure how well this applies to Mexico but...<p>I did the freelance/startup combination for about five years.  Its ok once if you can pull it off, but I do not recommend repeating it.  I have a lot of friends that do this, and on the whole I think it is a vicious cycle.  I don't mean you shouldn't freelance to fund a company.  If that seems the way forward, then do it - once.  But you shouldn't do this repeatedly.  Its an easy cycle to get into.  Instead, you should work at startups in between founding startups.<p>I find that you can get into this pattern:<p>1) Focus on billing in boring contract work to get spare cycles to work on startup.  Learn new skills to apply in new startup on your own time.
2) Startup makes progress, focus on startup, startup doesn't make it (most don't), savings run out.
3) Cling to hope.  Debt.
4) Repeat.<p>Most people I've known do not eject efficiently in stage 3, and bear excessive credit card debt, etc.  Whereas if you get a job at a startup, you can enter this pattern, and even if all these companies tank, you're better off:<p>1) Work a job at a startup where you do very interesting work, get paid to refine your skills, gain highly relevant experience.
2) Repeat 1, increasing in job coolness/responsibility.  Save money.
3) Now that you've built a reputation and network of excellence by working at startups, start a company that has a better chance of succeeding using your experience, cutting edge skills, network of potential co-founders and relationships with investors, potential employees and customers.<p>I was in the first pattern, now I'm going for the second.  Looking across many successful founders, this seems to be the most frequent way to arrive at a good outcome.  I value the experience from the first pattern, but my life is so much better now that I'm in the second.  I wish I'd entered it earlier.  Note: I had to move to silicon valley to enter the second pattern.<p>You might do well with your first company part timing it, but I find that struggling and part timing it is just a less effective way to learn to build companies than participating in a later stage company.  Other than the entrepreneurial drive itself, I think that building companies is actually something you learn, and that its something best learned by doing.  You can get early stage experience just starting something.  You only get that later stage experience in your own company if it makes it that far - but you can get it by joining a startup at any time.<p>I think a lot of people, especially those outside of silicon valley, miss this completely.  We tend to focus on the icons of silicon valley - pairs of young people that hit it big the first time out.  But most successful companies actually come from experienced engineers/entrepreneurs that got on the job training at other startups.  People work together, then they start companies together.

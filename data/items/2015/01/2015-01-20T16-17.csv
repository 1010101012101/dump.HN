However, by creating groups in Whatsapp you have something like a private Facebook where you can share data with the people you choose. Very simple. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I posted something on Facebook, but while I wrote this post I shared something in two Whatsapp groups.<p>G+ is in my opinion the a very good solution (circles are like whatsapp groups for your friends), but it didn&#x27;t make. I think that&#x27;s mainly because of the way you gained access to the product. For G+ you need the large, and untransparent Google account, whereas whatsapp needs just a phone number.",1421773179

Sure, you lose all those things you get with creditcards, but for me some advantages that bitcoin offers over credit cards (and yes I&#x27;m a consumer too) are more important, such us:<p>- I&#x27;m not afraid that any of the providers where I have bought things gets hacked, because my identity and payment details is not kept by them.<p>- Paying with bitcoin is so much easier, I don&#x27;t need to copy stupid numbers from a card with my keyboard ever again.<p>- I don&#x27;t need to check my bank account from time to time to see if I had charges that don&#x27;t correspond to things I didn&#x27;t buy.<p>- I&#x27;m not afraid of bank commissions that especially take place when I pay for things abroad.<p>These are the little things that will make a universal-worldwide-digital-coin succeed.

So this specific question is a resume tester, you claim 15 yrs experience on the resume, lets talk about a major gossip or controversial topic from 10 yrs ago that is pretty much irrelevant or uncontroversial today so someone with only 5 &quot;real&quot; years experience would have no opinion about the topic.<p>Also give the candidate a little BS, and evaluate the response.  In programmer land if you ask a candidate what the first line &#x27;#!/usr/bin/perl&#x27; means in a CGI script and if the candidate keeps cool then thats good, but if the candidate responds like the intro scene of the movie Bladerunner then its probably not so great of a candidate regardless of anything else.",1421773130

8917824,comment,8916993,8917382,0,0,dargani123,,,"Thanks for your comment. This is Darwish, the Product Manager working on Stats Engine. You are correct &quot;classic statistics&quot; is the method we used in the past. It also what is most commonly used in industry (the main reason we started with this method). This was not an easy project for us to take on, but after talking to customers and looking at our historical experiment data, it was clear how important this problem was to solve, and thats why we spent a lot of resources on fixing this. Just for those following along on this comment, its not that &quot;classic statistics&quot; on their own that are incorrect, but rather the misuse of these statistics that can be costly. When used &quot;incorrectly&quot; (not using a sample size calculator, running many goals and variations at a time etc..), you can meaningfully increase your chance of making a bad business decision or commit yourself to unnecessarily long sample sizes.  Using statistics correctly is an industry-wide problem that many have tried to solve with education (i.e. give statistics crash courses). We hope that our solution shows how important we think it is that statistics drive day-to-day decisions in organizations and that there are different ways (change the math, not the customer) to get customers to this point. Many companies have data science teams and in-house statisticians that are very aware of these problems, but many don&#x27;t and thats really where we wanted to help out. You can read more about why we thought this was a serious problem here: <a href=""http://blog.optimizely.com/2015/01/20/statistics-for-the-internet-age-the-story-behind-optimizelys-new-stats-engine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.optimizely.com/2015/01/20/statistics-for-the-int...</a>",1421772995

US nuclear war planning assumed that we&#x27;d be retaliating for a strike on us, and thus time was of the essence. Strategic Air Command had a goal of getting all of their strike bombers airborne within 15 minutes of a warning, and they could do it.

I run my all my Docker hosts on a VMWare infrastructure, which gives me best of both worlds. Yes - for some things, VMWare can&#x27;t be beaten - but that&#x27;s the nice thing: they are not mutually exclusive. Both are very handy tools in my toolbox, and neither are a one-stop solution. Docker sure adds complexity - but also a huge amount of flexibility. Once you understand the power of it all, and how to think with Docker (which isn&#x27;t that obvious) - it&#x27;s pretty damn good. Not that there are no downsides or things that could be improved, but nothing is perfect.<p>And then:<p>1) The problem is hugely exaggerated. It only applies to badly written software. And make sure we don&#x27;t lose syslog? Seriously? just mount /dev/log into your container (it&#x27;s a unix socket after all) and you&#x27;re done.<p>2) Arguably faster? Try booting up 15 instances of app X. With docker, that&#x27;s achieved in less than a second. On VMWare this has a huge memory and CPU overhead, not to mention boot-up times.<p>3) Try versioning VM&#x27;s. Good luck. I have 100% reproducible, versioned images generated and tested in our CI system, that I can easily deploy in a VM on my laptop where I will have 100% the same setup as it will in test/qa/prod. To deploy the new version, start new instance, point load balancer/proxy/whatever to the new instance (happens automagically btw). Everything goes well? Stop old instance. Something goes wrong? Point proxy to old instance, and kill the badly-behaving. If everything went well: zero downtime. If you detect something goes wrong, it&#x27;s nearly instant to switch back to the previous version. Also, testing this is a lot easier than with VM&#x27;s. Sure you could do that with VM&#x27;s too - but the overhead is massive, and takes a lot more time.<p>My ideal setup would be a hypervisor infrastructure with a bunch of VM&#x27;s running only Docker applications.",1421771686

The search point doesn&#x27;t gain momentum, so it quickly gets stuck in local minima.  If the search point &quot;picks up speed&quot; then it can coast up and back out of minima.  Then you bleed off the speed at greater or lesser rates so the search location (which you can think of as a particle) eventually doesn&#x27;t have enough energy to get out of the minimum it&#x27;s in.  This is very similar to Boltzmann-like behaviour - where you end up depends less on the area (measure) of your catchment, and more on the depth of your local optimum.  In this sense it shares some characteristics with SA.<p>Hence the &quot;ballistic&quot; part of this.<p>And truth be told, in several hundred dimensions <i>everything</i> is a crap shoot.

I do recall that the one non-Dune book of Herbert&#x27;s I attempted to read seemed like it was written while on acid, and not in a good way.<p><i>A Canticle for Leibowitz</i> is one of the best sci-fi novels I&#x27;ve read. Its author wasn&#x27;t very active, though, so there&#x27;s not much else from him. I haven&#x27;t read any of the rest, but none of it has the reputation that <i>Canticle</i> does.<p>I&#x27;d put forward Vonnegut, but a) he&#x27;s often not classed as a sci-fi writer for some reason, and b) I personally think he&#x27;s at his best when his sci-fi tendencies are kept to a minimum (Dead Eye Dick, Bluebeard, Galapagos, which is as more fantasy than sci-fi if one must stick a genre label on it). I&#x27;d class Atwood as similar to Vonnegut in this regard, but even more so—her sci-fi work is just OK, from what I&#x27;ve seen of it, and I prefer her &quot;straight&quot; fiction.<p>If found Clarke&#x27;s <i>The City and the Stars</i> deeply affecting (though, for long stretches, a bit of a chore), but the other couple novels of his I&#x27;ve read I wish I hadn&#x27;t. A couple interesting ideas that stick, but not much substance. They were <i>The Hammer of God</i> and <i>The Songs of a Distant Earth</i>, for the record. They weren&#x27;t even very entertaining. Both were late novels, so maybe his earlier stuff tends to be better? Mere speculation. I&#x27;ve been put off trying more of him by his current 1-for-3 record. I do like the movie 2001, though :-)<p>Bester&#x27;s probably my biggest blind spot among the sci-fi greats—I&#x27;ve read nothing by him.<p>I can recommend <i>The New Hugo Winners</i> collections over <i>The Hugo Winners</i>, pretty much universally, if you&#x27;re looking for short stories. Asimov all but sneers at them in his torch-passing introduction, but the reason he feels out of touch with those authors&#x27; work is because they&#x27;re <i>way better</i> than what he was used to. However, I&#x27;ve yet to find a contemporary sci-fi author I can rely upon to deliver an entire novel that doesn&#x27;t fall apart at some point, one way or another. I haven&#x27;t tried Murakami, who seems well regarded and is, by reputation, my greatest remaining chance.<p>(Just to be clear, I enjoy plenty of other sci-fi in a guilty-pleasure, lazy weekend sort of way, in the same way that I genuinely like watching [some] crappy movies on Netflix)",1421770619

I&#x27;ve only had to use it once.  The telescope was poorly designed and it was possible to run it into its hard limit (you could basically run it into the ground).  If you do that you have to stop it because the tracking motors will continue to try to drive the telescope into the ground.<p>The only exception was the Large Binocular Telescope, which is one of the largest telescopes around (even the largest, depending on how you define it).  But there a lot more thought was put into the design so you wouldn&#x27;t be able to run the telescope into the ground even if you tried.

And certainly don&#x27;t run programs that execute other programs that background. Keep it simple, and try to limit yourself to 1 process per container. Sure there might be situations where this cannot be avoided, but in 99% of the situations - this is not a problem.
Yes you have to be aware of this potential problem, but I am currently running tons of containers, of which only a few run supervisord (which handles reaping too) to run multiple processes within one container because it was the sane thing to do. Stale zombie processes on my docker hosts? None. These precautions in my opinion are only required for badly behaving software. And yes - there is software like that.",1421770333

Often times it is not a complete lack of work but more a situation where one project ends today but my next one does not start until the week after next.

Even if you fail people will give you lots of latitude if they personally like you.<p>I sub out work on occasion and have tried things at a few different levels. I have hired people off ELance and ODesk (which almost never works out); hired people I was introduced to and hired people off of CraigsList. In all of that certain truths remain, people who cost more money usually do that because they are better. Mostly at this point I hire other people like myself that have been at this for a long time and bill about what I do. I worry less about their work. In fact where possible I just bring them into a deal and let them work directly with my client. That way I am not in the middle of anything, I dont deal with money etc. Since I am not really trying to be a big firm making money off of people, skimming 15-20% off the top is just not worth the risks that come with it. Everyone is happier this way. I sometimes get asked if I worry that the person I bring in may steal my business and while the thought does cross my mind it is not the right thing to worry about.

But that&#x27;s not the point; it&#x27;s not what you say, but <i>what that means</i>. You have created a programming model that software people can understand intuitively, but also easily maps to hardware.<p>People may get hung up on this because the example on your page is so simple. The equivalent VHDL and Verilog is also relatively simple. A simple example is good, and a comparison is good, but just presenting the differences is not enough. Stress what someone coding in Cx <i>does not have to think about</i>. In other words, what are the abstractions in Cx?<p>Consider what the equivalent page for C versus assembly would look like for a function that computes some simple arithmetic. Some people may say, &quot;Oh, sure, the assembly has a few more lines because you need to push and pop parameters from the stack, but that&#x27;s no big deal.&quot; And it&#x27;s not - for one function. What&#x27;s the big deal is that there are entire concepts - saving existing registers, pushing parameters onto the stack, register management - that C programmers don&#x27;t need to think about.

Essentially, he was using some new equipment and saw 5 incoming missiles. He decided against acting upon that information as he saw it, rightfully, as a bug.  He may have gotten into some trouble with his superiors, but I imagine that has a lot more to do with the face-saving bureaucracy of the USSR than a readiness to launch with such limited information.<p>There must be a mountain of research into false positives of launches and more false positives than we know.  After the fall of the USSR we found that that this happened practically regularly. I believe the Soviets saw the Able Archer exercises in 1983 as a potential attack and even detected missile launches.  We also found out that Castro was ready to start nuclear war until his Soviet masters explained to him what that really means.<p>This is also why nuclear launch approval tends to be from the head of state only, instead of an automated process or via lower level delegates.",1421769788

If that knowledge happens to have some immediate positive impact on a problem affecting presently living people, then it may be worth pursuing if such a pursuit isn&#x27;t &quot;too expensive&quot;.<p>While it&#x27;s trivially obvious that the value of unknown knowledge is unknowable, this doesn&#x27;t often occur to such people, focused as they are on the limitations of the present instead of the possibilities of the future. Even if the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake <i>were</i> a completely useless activity which diverted resources away from more pressing problems, societies everywhere have accepted that their tax dollars inevitably fund certain things which are unnecessary. Clean parks, public support for the arts, city fireworks on holidays, etc. Yet people generally find these latter sinks of funding less objectionable than things like space exploration and federal support for science. Perhaps it&#x27;s because the enormous scientific illiteracy afflicting the populace as a whole (which can be observed simply by reading any popular journalistic account of scientific developments) places scientific developments and scientific pursuits into some mental category of &quot;abstract, probably useless stuff&quot;.",1421769616

Given enough time and &quot;research&quot;, people can master this aspect effectively. That&#x27;s science.<p>Engineering is the rest of the driving experience. The placement of traffic lights, how to synchronise them so two perpendicular roads are not green at the same time, and all of the signaling (stop, yield, etc) that we are used to.<p>The difference is there is a bigger solution space in engineering: there is no &quot;one correct answer&quot;, and the factors involved in determining whether something is a good engineering solution are much broader. For example, reusing the signaling example above, the &quot;stop&quot; sign doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be a hexagonal red shape, but some early civil engineer figured that shape is the most adequate.",1436777421

For instance, the open-source web-ui where users can interact with their cluster is simply a plugin on top of the core ContainerShip software.<p>ContainerShip Cloud offers more compelling differences such as:<p>* Automatic installation on your favorite cloud provider with a few clicks (constantly adding new providers). As well as the ability to scale your cluster (leader & follower nodes) directly from ContainerShip cloud when additional capacity is needed.<p>* Point-in-time backups of the entire state of your cluster, including all applications and any persistent data being written to a volume.<p>* Restoration of backups to the same cluster, or an entirely different ContainerShip cluster you are running on any cloud (or on-prem).<p>Even more features are currently in the works.

9876967,comment,9876911,9876911,0,0,jcr,,,"The (<i>unmentioned</i>) title of the paper is, &quot;BlueDBM: an appliance for big data analytics&quot;<p>Abstract:<p>><i>&quot;Complex data queries, because of their need for random\naccesses, have proven to be slow unless all the data can be\naccommodated in DRAM. There are many domains, such as\ngenomics, geological data and daily twitter feeds where the\ndatasets of interest are 5TB to 20 TB. For such a dataset, one\nwould need a cluster with 100 servers, each with 128GB to\n256GBs of DRAM, to accommodate all the data in DRAM.\nOn the other hand, such datasets could be stored easily in the\nflash memory of a rack-sized cluster. Flash storage has much\nbetter random access performance than hard disks, which\nmakes it desirable for analytics workloads. In this paper we\npresent BlueDBM, a new system architecture which has flash-\nbased storage with in-store processing capability and a low-\nlatency high-throughput inter-controller network. We show\nthat BlueDBM outperforms a flash-based system without these\nfeatures by a factor of 10 for some important applications.\nWhile the performance of a ram-cloud system falls sharply\neven if only 5%~10% of the references are to the secondary\nstorage, this sharp performance degradation is not an issue\nin BlueDBM. BlueDBM presents an attractive point in the\ncost-performance trade-off for Big Data analytics.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/wjun/papers/ISCA15_Sang-Woo_Jun.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.csail.mit.edu/wjun/papers/ISCA15_Sang-Woo_Jun....</a>",1436775732

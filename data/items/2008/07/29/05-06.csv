260153,comment,260017,260017,0,0,fallentimes,,,"This guy is presumptuous, ill informed and appears to have a thing for blanket statements.<p>Hi, I'm currently in YC for the summer. Although I certainly don't speak for everyone in YC, I think I'm somewhat more qualified than the author who has never been in the program and who apparently receives his information from blog posts and hearsay.<p>Most of his assertions apply to startups or any intense forms of collaboration (as PC noted) in general. Although we work a significant amount of hours, it's not as if we never get out. I've gotten to know many of the other cofounders very well outside of YC. Additionally, is it really work if you enjoy what you're doing? I rather work 60-80 hours per week on something I like that challenges me, than 40 hours per week on something I'm disinterested in. As for the pure speculative, link-baiting stuff:<p>""Young, impressionable and inexperienced entrepreneurs are willing to sacrifice their health, happiness and creativity while pursuing wealth.""\nThis is the second company I've started. It's my business partner's second as well. Many of the founders in YC have worked at startups or run their own businesses before.<p>Happiness/Creativity? I went from working a 9-7 office job I wasn't interested in to working on my dream project.<p>Health? Due to increased schedule flexibility, I've actually been able to exercise more and eat better. I've lost a good 5 lbs.<p>""They receive unconditional love, acceptance, and attention from a charismatic...""\nYou should have been at my team's first meeting; it was like this, but the opposite. Informal founder feedback sessions have been similar. The carebear environment the author described wouldn't work anyway - the VCs would destroy us.<p>""They are subject to entrapment (isolation from friends, relatives, and the mainstream culture) and their access to information is severely controlled.""\nIsolation? My parents just visited this past weekend. I still keep in touch with all of my friends even if many of them wear the hat of beta tester. If anything, I've been able to keep in _better_ touch with my friends because they're all curious about what I'm working on. Talking about a startup is a lot more fun than talking about a 9-5 or 9-7 for that matter.<p>Without YC I'd still be at my same old job trying to work on our startup on the side. This is not only difficult to do, but very slow as well. YC essentially moved everything up a year or two and allowed us to work on what we love while being surrounded with a bunch of brilliant people to bounce ideas off of and anxious investors to present to. What more could two cofounders originally from Ohio ask for?",1217310927

260132,comment,259988,260130,0,0,unalone,,,"I understand why people use Windows, and I understand why they use Linux. I'm a big fan of the Linux community, but I laugh at the notion that Ubuntu comes even close to rivalling OS X. Windows users are a lot less arrogant than either Linux or Mac users, and so while I'd advise them to switch, I don't like the constant anti-Windows crusades going on.<p>Firefox I really dislike. It's better than IE. No doubt about that. But it progresses with ideas slowly, it's a terribly cluttered browser, I dislike the idea of building a super-powered web browser, and the developers and the community are both extremely distasteful. While I'm not not a huge fan of using Opera myself, it's a much better browser and I absolutely respect the devteam. And I think that if you genuinely want just a speedy, damn fast web browser, Safari's the one to pick. It discourages mass fiddling, and that helps me stay on task a lot.<p>Ad blocking I'm fine with, but people put such emphasis on it. People who use AdSense spend more time telling me how great adlessness is that I find myself wasting more time ignoring them than I do ignoring ads. And, of course, for Safari the adblockers cost money, and I find that paying to remove ads is just immensely silly. I mentioned adblockers just because that's a feature that a lot of people seem to spend their time on.<p>(Sorry if I write long responses to small statements. It's a bad habit.)",1217309954
260131,comment,259977,260122,0,0,tss,,,"There is certainly solid legal ground for arguing that Google giving preferential search results to itself is an anticompetitive practice.  It would be different if Google didn't control the vast majority of the search market, but it does.<p>Let's say there is a phone book company that pretty much controls the entire market.  Google's actions are akin to the phonebook company only listing businesses that it owns in the main pages, while listing everything else in an appendix.  Anticompetitive practice, to be sure.  The phonebook company might argue, ""Well since we are so tightly integrated with out own businesses, it is much easier to index them.  Our competitors ending up in the back is simply an unintended side effect"".  Possibly true, but it's not going to fly in court.<p>To be honest, I don't care if Google is giving preferential treatment to Knol.  But please, establish some plausible deniability.  The speed in which Knol is being indexed is far too obvious. I think it would be a damn shame if Google were to lose its hold on the search market because of a lawsuit.",1217309699

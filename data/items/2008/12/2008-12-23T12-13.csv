While I admire Penrose's book, I believe Lawrie's is written at a more consistent level and is probably more accessible to many (though not all) people.",1230037119

Which car did Porsche's 911 or Mercedes' S-class? Or for that matter, Toyota's Prius?<p>I see plenty of examples of foreign competition innovating successfully, often at ""non-competitive"" prices. Detroit's last significant innovation was what? The 60-month car lease? The UAW job bank?",1230036740

It may be easy to spoof the IP of <i>requests</i> in protocols like HTTP (assuming the networks don't filter erroneous packets), but the RIAA doesn't typically go after people who merely download, they go after the people who share.<p>It seems like it would be much harder to spoof an IP when you're trying to act as a server (as the people who are sharing on BitTorrent and other P2P networks are) since you need to actually receive the requests to know what/when to respond with.<p>Perhaps this is one of the reasons they only go after the sharers (and of course, to cut of the supply... like going after drug dealers instead of drug users)",1230035977

407494,comment,406407,407211,0,0,patio11,,,"Toyota Motor Vehicles (トヨタ自動車), which is what most Americans think of when they think of Toyota, is one of the members of the Toyota Group, which used to be a <i>keiretsu</i>, basically a related family of companies in different verticals.  (Toyota is distinct from many Japanese keiretsu in that it is largely concentrated in one vertical.)<p>There are other big components: Toyota Industries (豊田自動織機) for example, which makes machine tools.  Number one customer: well, duh.  But they also sell them all to other folks as well.<p>Now here's where it gets hairy: Toyota Industries owns Toyota Motors (largest single shareholder), but Toyota Motors also owns a quarter of the stock of Toyota Industries.<p>Now repeat that with another dozen or so major companies which you probably haven't heard of, and any number of minor satellite firms.<p>This ends up as one big web, which is collectively the Toyota Group.  It is very possible for the group as a whole to be prospering while one or several group companies struggle.  How they work this out is an exercise in business management and accounting that would boil your brains -- don't ask me, I'm just an engineer (and, er, customer and shareholder and not-quite-employee but as I mentioned disentangling Nagoya from Toyota is like asking for a human body minus all the carbon).",1230035430

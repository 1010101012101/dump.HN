900580,comment,897050,897448,0,0,goodside,,,"To the extent that it's only a signaling mechanism, though, it doesn't make sense to subsidize it. Encouraging everyone to go to college with the state paying half their tuition doesn't confer any benefit on the public. It just appears to because it's inflating a common metric of intelligence, thus providing impetus for further subsidy, and so on. It's as if the government noticed that people with large diamonds are happier, healthier, and smarter than people without (which they probably are), so they started subsidizing diamond mines for the good of the public.<p>It might be advantageous for any given peacock to have a bigger, flashier, and more cumbersome tail than the next peacock, but the arms race makes it ever more certain that the peacocks will go extinct if a new predator shows up. Money that's spent on escalating signals is money that could be spent on other things, and once the public cost becomes high enough that people get disgusted and stop respecting the signal (e.g., large SUVs) its value plummets.<p>I don't think college is at the breaking point just yet, and it might still be rational to get that generic bachelor's. But if tuition continues to rise at its current rate, which greatly outpaces inflation, there will come a day when the bubble bursts.",1256399756

When you hit the ground, you stop because there is a large force accelerating you upwards. On Jupiter, there is still the same upwards force on you, but a stronger downwards force from gravity, and therefore you will decelerate somewhat more slowly. Not a lot more slowly, since the upward force from the ground is much larger than the gravitational force, but it still makes a difference.<p>On the other hand, if you're on a planet with more gravity, the ground is likely to be harder since there's more force compressing it together, but that's a whole different issue.",1256399748

900561,comment,900382,900507,0,0,btilly,,,"<i>If that were true, why doesn't all matter stick together in one giant gob?</i><p>A typical atom has a net charge of 0 with minor local variations.  Therefore its attractive force drops off much faster than 1/r^2.  And so electromagnetic attraction between atoms effectively disappears at any significant distance.<p><i>If the structure of an atom is ""obviously"" affected by the exclusion principle, why would the structure of materials, made up of atoms, make any difference?</i><p>It is possible for both rigid and non-rigid materials to satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle.  Therefore the rigidity of things around us cannot be caused by the Pauli exclusion principle.<p><i>In fact, both Coulombic repulsion and the exclusion principle are involved in the hardness of materials. I believe the Coulombic fraction is larger than 50%, but the other part is certainly non-negligible.</i><p>Are you talking about volume or hardness?<p>You are right that the exclusion principle results in volume.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle#Stability_of_matter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle#Stabi...</a> for verification.  (That effect is much bigger than I had realized.)  However it does not necessarily result in rigid things that are hard.<p>Consider, for example, dropping a bucket of fresh water into salt water.  Does the fresh water stop quickly upon impact?  Obviously not.  Now consider dropping a rock in the dirt.  Does the rock stop quickly upon impact?  Obviously it does.<p>What is different between the two scenarios?  The answer is the structure of the materials, which are held together by electromagnetic forces.  Therefore it really is electromagnetic forces that quickly stop falling solid objects that hit solid things.",1256398754

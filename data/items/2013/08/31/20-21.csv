The work ethic is very strong, the atmosphere is pro-business, and employees are loyal almost to a fault.  In California I think the M.O. is &quot;looking out for number one&quot; -- in Utah I felt that even low level employees often have a sense of commitment to their employers.  I also think that Mormons specifically can be good in sales due to their missionary work which is two-years of religiously mandated door-to-door sales training.<p>But the Utah culture lacks in other areas -- specifically on &quot;being a hustler/hacker&quot; and being creative, neither of which is plentiful in Utah.<p>By the way, Overstock and Novell are the only tech companies in Utah I can think of -- are there any that are more recent?",1377982790
6308059,comment,6307972,6307972,5,0,quanticle,,,">Well, the whole point of an office is to get work done.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about that. The whole point of an office seems to be to allow management to <i>verify</i> that you&#x27;re getting work done. Or, to put it even more accurately, to allow management to <i>feel like</i> they&#x27;re verifying that you&#x27;re getting work done.<p>I&#x27;m not sure Floobits addresses that. In fact, I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s possible for a product to address that. It seems like the sort of thing that&#x27;ll require a generational shift (as newer managers comfortable with remote work replace older managers who aren&#x27;t).",1377982777
6308058,comment,6306906,6307951,4,0,justin_vanw,,,"Get them back on their feet??  Do you think they are homeless because they ran into some temporary setback?  What do you think of these people that you think they are perfectly capable of living a normal life, but they hit some speedbump along the way and now they are too, what? How pathetic would they have to be if some accident of life left them permanently on the street?  How little you must think of them!<p>Drug addiction and crippling mental illness effect over 95% of chronically homeless people.  These are people struggling with things you and I can&#x27;t even <i>imagine</i> coping with.  I mean that, you and I can&#x27;t fathom in any meaningful way what it means for our perceptions and judgments about the world to be completely unreliable.  It&#x27;s pretty much not possible to cope with hearing voices or having visual hallucinations or crippling addiction.  You can&#x27;t &#x27;get them back on their feet&#x27;, because they are not healthy enough to stand on their own, and we don&#x27;t know (I mean the royal we, all of the medical and psychiatric expertise in the world is more or less helpless in the face of what they are suffering from) any way to make it better.  In fact you can&#x27;t merely <i>offer</i> them help, because they very often aren&#x27;t mentally stable enough or responsible enough to accept it.<p>The best thing we can offer them is long term support.  We can give them food and warm/clean clothing, offer medical care, and respond when they have an emergency.  We can offer them safe shelter and mental health care, that is, when they are in a mental state such that they will accept it.<p>We can scrape them off the sidewalk when they OD, and we can temporarily put them in a hospital when they are so unstable that they are very likely to cause injury to themselves or others.  Of course, there is a fine line in such paternal actions, at some point we are violating their humanity when we give them involuntary help.  Sometimes the best systems we can create to do so end up being worse on the whole than doing nothing (institutionalization of the mentally ill for example).<p>That is the state of the art.  Someday we, as a society and civilization, will be able to tend to the least fortunate in more effective ways, but what I described is literally the best we know how to do right now.  Of course everyone, even us greedy Silicon Valley types, have a strong desire to make this better, but unfortunately nobody knows how to do it.  We are spending <i>HUGE</i> amounts of money, and besides reducing suffering a little, we aren&#x27;t able to achieve much more.",1377982768

6308052,comment,6306906,6307198,1,0,akgerber,,,"It is inaccurate to say there are far fewer apartments in Manhattan-- many neighborhoods simply became less crowded, as improving mass transit meant that a working-class family sharing a one- or two-room apartment could have a larger space in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, or suburbs beyond, while maintaining access to Manhattan wages. There are also far more single adults and childless couples in the American population (especially in NYC) versus 1910, meaning an apartment that once held a family now often houses only one or two people. The New York Times had an interesting piece on this last year[0]:\n&quot;Manhattan was much more crowded in the early 1900s than today, especially in the tenements of the Lower East Side. For example, in 1910, 66 people lived on the four residential floors of 94 Orchard Street. Today, the buildilng houses 15 people.&quot;<p>And, in fact, many apartments have been built in Manhattan since 1910-- much of far northern Manhattan wasn&#x27;t developed by then, and middle-class apartment houses were in their infancy.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that Manhattan (and its commuter-shed) doesn&#x27;t need more new housing, and that the 1963 zoning code governing NYC isn&#x27;t problematic: for example, inner Brooklyn, on top of tons of subway lines still has parking requirements, and many areas are zoned such that any new construction would be less dense than what it would replace. The problem isn&#x27;t a supply that&#x27;s been reduced, but rather a supply that isn&#x27;t increasing along with demand, with zoning laws that often prevent any densification that would lead to increased supply.<p>The same problem holds in Silicon Valley, except that its zoning holds it to a suburban, rather than an insufficiently urban, form.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/01/realestate/manhattans-population-density-past-and-present.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/01/realestate/man...</a>",1377982656

I have seen it in several establishments around here (Seattle) but I have never seen it used, and the employees tell me it is not popular or easy (unlike, say, Square). I don&#x27;t know Kuapay. Starbucks had something of a firm place from which to launch, so it&#x27;s not really comparable.<p>What&#x27;s the poor ordering experience? Trying to get the bartender&#x27;s attention? I would submit that a poor order experience is a consequence of the establishment, not the fundamentals of the ordering process. Personally, I like the bar experience, it&#x27;s personal, it&#x27;s immediate, you can get recommendations, and it&#x27;s fairly equitable for everyone around (shovers will be ignored by a good bartender, though a good bartender is by no means guaranteed). On the other hand, a remote ordering situation turns every bar into a drink machine activated by an impersonal, drive-thru-like interface. If you prefer that to the existing system, perhaps you should patronize a better bar!<p>I agree that there is probably some interesting way to leverage personal technology in this space, but it&#x27;s not this. This app does not improve the &quot;ordering experience,&quot; it eliminates it. That&#x27;s a bad idea.",1377982346
6308041,comment,6307769,6307769,4,0,ihsw,,,"Tumblr made a blog post[1] about exploiting similar compression techniques.<p>Using that technique, personally I&#x27;ve had great success storing data in hashes by JSON-encoding it beforehand, where it would normally be like so:<p><pre><code>    HSET user:159784623 username ihsw\n    HSET user:159784623 email blahblah@gmail.com\n    HSET user:159784623 created_at 1377986411\n</code></pre>\nBut instead it&#x27;s like so:<p><pre><code>    HSET user:156039 687 {&quot;username&quot;:&quot;ihsw&quot;,&quot;email&quot;:&quot;blahblah@gmail.com&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;: 1377986411}\n</code></pre>\nWhere we divide data into &quot;buckets&quot; that are 1024 in size and given an ID of 159784623, the resulting bucket ID is 156039 and the remainder is 687.<p><pre><code>    id = 159784623\n    bucket_size = 1024\n    remainder = id % bucket_id\n    bucket_id = (id - remainder) / bucket_size\n</code></pre>\nUsing this I&#x27;ve been able to reduce memory usage anywhere from 40%-80% (yes, 80%), which depends compressibility of the data (length and randomness of each hash item).<p>I&#x27;ve also been replacing dictionary keys with integers and it further reduces the size of the data being stored by an additional ~30%.<p><pre><code>    HSET user:156039 687 {&quot;0&quot;:&quot;ihsw&quot;,&quot;1&quot;:&quot;blahblah@gmail.com&quot;,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;1377986411}\n</code></pre>\nIt shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated how these simple techniques can make such a significant impact, especially when the gains are quite considerable.

6308035,comment,6306795,6307797,1,0,rdl,,,"I think we all agree startups should innovate a lot on their core product where it can be a useful differentiator.  I think this goes far beyond &quot;business model&quot; -- things like which programming language to use for the core product are good things to innovate on.  Using untested/unpopular technologies like Linux, functional languages (well, really just interpreted languages, functional was still a small subset), Apache, etc. became useful advantages for some companies in ~2000.  Using the cloud in 2008-2010, or adopting social and then mobile from 2008-2012.  Not sure what it is today (I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s hostproof/security-from-NSA, but that&#x27;s probably not it for most businesses.)<p>I hope we all agree startups have finite resources and shouldn&#x27;t try to innovate (or really even spend much time on) the really mundane things which don&#x27;t matter to that particular startup.  Legal paperwork, trash disposal, etc.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting question which things are in the middle, and how much innovation/experimentation is reasonable there.  Hiring is clearly core, so things around hiring might be more legitimate grounds for experimentation than others.  I don&#x27;t think cash compensation is the pain point for most of that, though -- how people pick projects, how people are recruited, etc.",1377982273

Period.<p>I say &#x27;high efficiency&#x27; because you can optimize a lot of things for maximum profit.<p>Programmers are dead cheap. By programmers, I mean real programmers. You can hire decent programmers for $150-$200 a month. And that&#x27;s a pretty standard amount in the IT scenario in India. The last time I checked people were paying $1000-$2000 for an average marketer who cold calls and emails random people in Western countries.<p>Of course, the next thing you&#x27;d argue is about the &#x27;quality&#x27; of the programmers. See, these are real people. I know you get to meet a lot of shitty Indians everywhere. They&#x27;re all over freelancing market places, take your money and do a shitty job. Agreed. But these people are not the 100% of the IT work force in India. They&#x27;re probably like 30-40% which is large, but they are very much employable. All you need to do is just teach them the right way to do things and they&#x27;ll grasp. And they improve. Just like everybody else. They&#x27;re also people like us, right?<p>Next, I say &#x27;maximum profit&#x27; because there&#x27;s a lot of things that will save you money in India.<p>Need some office space?

That&#x27;s just $100 a year.<p>Let&#x27;s do the math for an American incorporation?<p>$200-$600 for Incorporating an LLC\n$50-$100/yr for Registered agent.\nAttorney fees - $1000-$15000 (decent attorney)<p>Travel is dead cheap in India. For $10 you can travel between two states comfortably on a Volvo A/C bus. Traveling within the city? That&#x27;s just $2 cents. Or $1 cent. Actually even less. Depends on your mode.<p>Safety. I know you&#x27;ve been reading a lot of rape and stuff in the news channel. So, everybody gets to read only the bad parts (Media, again). However, there are a lot of posh, decent areas where there are cops circling around almost 24/7 till night. These places cost slightly extra, but they are totally worth it.<p>Also, it is very important that you realize that India has rape incidents mean the whole nation is spread out with rapists. Rape cases are most often encountered in the northern region. It&#x27;s safe to say that Southern India is pretty safe (much much safe) compared to North India, which is almost full of sex-starved assholes (vague generalizaion)<p>This is not to say that South India has no rape at all. Just like any other country, abuse exists, but it&#x27;s pretty controlled in the South. The last time a child molester was caught, he was shot dead in an encounter. (encounters of nasty criminals are pretty common here). Just avoid going out in the nights to lonely places and you should be pretty safe. Avoid public transportation if you can, or opt for deluxe buses/trains. India is as safe as any other country if you take some general precautions.<p>Now back to our start up. If you started up in the United states/United Kingdom, you&#x27;d be blowing out money like water. But if you start up in India and seek funding from abroad, most likely people will avoid you because you are an India, and the complications involved. My advice - Setup a C-Corp/LLC/whatever in the States/UK or which ever country you need funding from and then run it from India through an Indian Pvt limited as its partner.<p>Why?\nBecause in India, nobody wants to sue you for rounded corners. Nobody sues startups in India. And even if they do (0.01% probability), the lawyers are pretty cheap. And even if you lose in court, you will most likely have loopholes to escape. And even if you lose the case, you&#x27;d be paying very few for damages ($500-$10000) much much lower than compared to what you&#x27;d be paying in America/UK.<p>But, the Indian startup scenario is also full of assholes. The founders are generally good, but most lack decent vision. And the accelerators. Oh god, these guys want to be the face of the start up eco-system and will be all over the place. They will want huge percentages in your company to introduce you to some founder you can actually meet over coffee yourself. And seeking funding? Good luck figuring out the terms. Shady at best.<p>But, with all that said, India is the best place for efficient bootstrapping startups. Period. FYI Zoho is from (South) India.<p>The best example I can show you that this is valid advice is to set myself up in India and become really successful, which I will and let my lovely HN community know soon.<p>Ty",1377981862

In lay terms it suggests that if you choose to lose weight for example (the direct route), you are unlikely to succeed. Alternatively, if you choose to become a great cyclist, you are likely to lose weight, (the oblique route.)<p>Prof. Kay uses ICI which was a leading pharma company in the UK to explain obliquity in business. In 1987 ICI&#x27;s mission statement read &#x27;we make awesome products and innovate new drugs where possible to do good.&#x27; (wasn&#x27;t in those words, but that was the message.) In 1994, they changed their mission statement to &#x27;we exist to increase shareholder value,&#x27; and dropped the rest. The company went bankrupt not long after. The oblique route resulted in one of the largest companies in their field with the highest shareholder value, the direct route resulted in bankruptcy, i.e. the absolute lowest shareholder value.<p>Increasing shareholder value is only a motivation of the shareholders not surprisingly. Employees and customers have little interest in increasing shareholder value directly (unless they are significant shareholders) yet it is through motivating customers and employees that a company will grow and increase shareholder value the most. When longtime ICI employee Sir James Black (Nobel Prize Winner) was asked to change from making awesome drugs to pushing existing drugs on a roadshow to increase shareholder value, he left the company. He later created more blockbuster drugs in his new role, but not at ICI.

It might be a cute way to let someone buy $1.00 or so in stock inside his 401k (0.1%?) and then $19999 worth of S&P500.  If it&#x27;s post-A or post-B it would be a lot more sane, but still $20k might be a lot.  If I were an engineer with 0.1% of a company hired at a midway-between-A-and-B company, and I could get $20k in free money, I might put $5k into buying extra company stock if that got me 0.3%, particularly since it would let me sell it and use the gains to invest tax-deferred for the next ~40 years.<p>There is an utterly batshit insane thing called a &quot;Rollover As Business Startups&quot; where you roll your own 401k over into a 401k in your newly-formed business which then buys its own stock and use that to capitalize your business.

This could come off as glib, but is Silicon Valley really in any position to be complaining about another culture being too homogeneous, or too exclusive of &quot;different&quot; demographics (e.g., I dunno, women)? Don&#x27;t make me laugh.<p>This is particularly disappointing because there are much better reasons to justify your decisions to not found your startup in Utah. Let&#x27;s start with the fact that the investment scene, and in particular, the angel scene, is completely and utterly toxic.<p>I won&#x27;t go into specifics, because badmouthing people on the Internet is mean, but most of funding (especially angel funding) in Utah is structured as a competition, where startups compete for money. The result is that there is no camaraderie between companies in the way that there is in, say, NYC or the bay area. People are friendly, but there is not really any knowledge ventilation because the angels cultivate this atmosphere of competition. The result is a divisive and poisonous atmosphere that is antithetical (IMHO) to hacker culture. In my experience, this lack of sharing knowledge makes it quite hard to build things. You&#x27;re extremely unlikely to find a successful coworking space here, for example.<p>So ultimately, the talent pool here is deep, but until this cultural problem is fixed, Utah will always be a distant 11th to other venues.<p>EDIT: and before we all jump on the hate train, I&#x27;m an avowed atheist who left Mormonism.

6307952,comment,6306962,6307679,17,0,zackmorris,,,"I see what you are getting at that basing a programming language on one dialect like english is a bad idea.<p>But what I disagree with is that pure mathematics is more useful than other ways of thinking.  Anymore, I find that having to adapt myself to whatever methodology a language imposes on me is generally more work than the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve.<p>Take for example the current hubbub over promises to try to reduce callback hell in javascript.  What I find almost amusing is that callback hell shouldn&#x27;t exist in the first place.  It was solved trivially thirty years ago with cooperative threads on pre-NeXT Mac OS.  It&#x27;s obvious in hindsight that cooperative threads were a mistake for kernels, but they turn out to work quite well for processes (the people who wrote Go realized this and did one better, adapting some of the functional concepts from Erlang into a cooperative-thread style that can run concurrently because there&#x27;s little or no shared data).  You rarely have to deal with mutexes or atomic operations (except in cases where one of your operations spans a yield).  IMHO they left yield out of javascript in browsers originally for political reasons, because it was already handled by the runtime.  Adding it back in is a reluctant admittance that it&#x27;s become a necessity in today&#x27;s complex GUIs.<p>Anywhere I look today, I see these problems revisited that were really solved in better ways years ago.  A great example of dogma today is templates in c++.  Such an astonishing amount of boilerplate to do things that are so easy in other languages, or with more fine grain control of macros.  And a lot of the verbosity goes away when you allow variables to infer their type from the return value of a function.  Statically typed variables are even a form of dogma.  What matters is the underlying piece of data, not the name of the variables that refer to it.  We should be dealing with things as a large graph where the data is hashed or referenced somehow if we need a name for it.  Honestly most of the code I write now doesn&#x27;t even have variables.  I only use them when I have to work around a limitation of the language (for a long time php wouldn&#x27;t let you use the array access [] operator after on function result) or when a piece of code is too large to fit on a line.  Variables themselves don&#x27;t actually exist, they are an abstraction.  If C had a way to make a const type and initialize it later, we could emulate many of the advantages of functional programming by using the variable name to refer to the result of a block of code.  Another example are the blocks in objective-c, which are just nested anonymous functions or lambdas.  These should have been part of the c standard from the very beginning, but with nicer syntax (like javascript).  I think they were left out for political reasons, because someone early on recognized that they would lead to callback hell!  How messed up is that?<p>I could go on almost forever on this stuff.  Lisp gets around most of these problems easily, but to me it&#x27;s the mathematical equivalent of machine code.  Haskell and Scala try to make it more readable but fail due to their obsession with brief notation.  Conceptually none of this stuff is all that complicated.  I remember the first time I saw someone using Excel and when it hit me what they were actually doing, it shook my world so fundamentally that for a moment I thought that everything I learned in computer science had been a waste of time.  That feeling never quite left me.<p>If I had a hope for computer science today, it&#x27;s that we would take the sheer simplicity of functional programming (graph-style like Excel) and build layers above it that extend a programmer&#x27;s leverage.  Here are a few examples off the top of my head:<p>* Dealing with everything as an array to provide inherent parallelism in Matlab<p>* Making concurrent programming look single-threaded by using select in Go<p>* SQL queries to retrieve data by its relationship, not its address<p>* Triggering actions to run when something changes like Prolog<p>* Dealing with atomic messages instead of streams like in Go<p>* Memory-mapped IO instead of loading files into memory<p>* Using pure sockets/file descriptors and pipes instead of proprietary APIs to access data (also pipes are just double-ended file descriptors if we could truncate from the front, and shouldn&#x27;t exist as a separate concept)<p>* Tying objects to their representation, for example changing the visible attribute in javascript and seeing the element appear instead of calling a setVisible() function (in a fundamental way to ease the burden on programmers, not just syntactic sugar)<p>* Lazy evaluation/referential transparency (treating code like data and vice versa)<p>* Nested languages like Terra instead of writing glue (calling c from lua the way we used to call asm from c)<p>* Universal JIT compilers so we can quit arguing about one language being faster than another and focus on abstract concepts<p>* Integrating genetic programming into languages so we can express a function by its desired input and output instead of having to write every line of code by hand<p>* Losing the concept of a file altogether and focus on state like CouchDB<p>* Make all of this readable by treating the language as a view of the code (for example switching to tabs showing other views like prefix/infix/postfix or human readable like Hypertalk)<p>* Begin thinking of code as pruning a tree instead of manually solving the problem (let the computer explore every permutation of the problem space and return the results for review like solving equations in Mathematica x = yz -> y = x/z -> z = x/y)<p>* Standardize the way libraries communicate (Python should be able to talk to Wolfram Alpha and feed the results into a shell script then save each line in a SQL database with full unicode support)<p>* Get rid of drivers and adapt something like HTML for all devices so that they can be queried, controlled and listened to<p>This got way too long so I will stop there.

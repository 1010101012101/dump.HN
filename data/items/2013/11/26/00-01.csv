6798336,comment,6795594,6796271,4,0,mbreese,,,"The only way to make money is to be able to mine more than your costs. A small USB ASIC miner is now around $30-40 for 330 Mhash/sec and the 2-3Ghash/sec USB models are ~$200 on ebay. You&#x27;d have to make more than that much money with your mining. At current exchange rates, you can make about 50-75 cents a week with a 330 Mhash/sec miner. That would require 40-60 weeks to pay back the costs. And that&#x27;s not counting the electricity that you&#x27;re using, which is small, but is probably more than 50 cents a week in some areas of the country. And that also doesn&#x27;t then into account the expected drops in mining rewards.<p>At some point when you are scaling, your costs are lower than your expected income. You <i>have</i> to be doing this at scale in order to break even, let alone make money. And, if you have a sufficiently large setup, you aren&#x27;t talking about mining in pools, you have your own pool, where you keep the rewards for each mined block.<p>Little guys mining get minuscule rewards for negligible costs. You aren&#x27;t going to make any significant money with it.<p>Source: I&#x27;ve been running a 330Mhash/sec USB ASIC miner for the past two weeks :) I&#x27;m a total newbie, but the economics of it aren&#x27;t good.",1385427577

The list will start off innocent enough but <i>when</i>(not if) it starts being abused, it&#x27;ll be all over. It&#x27;ll start with blatant thefts like this, but the blacklist-maintainers, whoever they are, will eventually attract the attention of the law enforcement. The definition of theft will expand and expand. Eventually these blacklist-maintainers and/or GOV will decide which coins are valid are which are not. Coins will be seized just because of some random political agenda and bitcoin will just be a mess. The only way to stay off the blacklist will be to register with some authority and basically bitcoin will be no different from a regular bank. Then everyone will abandon it and go to Litecoin.<p>Seriously, the moment I hear about a blacklist of coins on bitcoin is the same day I buy $5,000USD of Litecoin.

And second, if you want the apartment, there&#x27;s a good chance you can get the apartment (whereas last time I went apartment-shopping in San Francisco, there would be 20+ people in line for the open house, including many couples who were new-hires at technology companies. it was insane.)",1385427473

6798321,comment,6795263,6798158,1,0,ithkuil,,,"Indeed, there&#x27;s a lot of misunderstanding around this aspect.<p>The strength of the eventually consistent systems doesn&#x27;t lie in the fact that it guarantees consistency during network partitioning, but that it maintains availability in face of partitioning. Even parts of the cluster that have been cut-off from the quorum can operate, in various degrees of degradation, ranging from being able to respond to stale queries, or also accept writes whose consistency is later resolved (for example with vector clocks or Commutative Replicated Data Types, see <a href=\"http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/12/23/paper-crdts-consistency-without-concurrency-control.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/12/23/paper-crdts-consi...</a> or <a href=\"http://basho.com/tag/crdt/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://basho.com/tag/crdt/</a>)<p>If I understood it correctly, InfiniSQL isn&#x27;t trying to solve the problem of providing backend capacity for parts of your cluster that are currently partitioned, assuming that you can minimise the likelihood of this event to happen. If a network partition happens in the cluster, it&#x27;s also very likely that all services in that partition will not be able to serve transactions, hence there is no much to gain from a system that is able to accept writes or perform stale reads without quorum.<p>On the other hand there are other workloads, like batch processing, that might benefit of being able to continue operating during a network partition without loosing big parts of processing capacity.",1385427431

That is, stay awake until you are no more than 10 to 9 hours from when you have to wake up next.  The extra hour or two compensates for the missed sleep.   Make sure the bedroom is dark, cool and quiet.  I need an alarm to wake me up, when it goes off, get up.<p>Same trick also works for me when adjusting for jet lag.

Node honestly is very performant overall given the time in which it takes a developer to code, test and deploy (tradeoffs). Also IMO Node has a little more available in terms of examples and people that have already hit the issues ahead of you.  So if time to completion is important, it might be faster for that purpose alone.  Then if you find a hot path, work to optimize it etc.<p>For what it is worth too, I hear people complain about Node occasionally and it is usually when they are trying to do longer running tasks, like huge sorts etc.  Node is not a good candidate for work that blocks the event loop for long periods, there are better tools for that as you probably already know.  The other complaints I hear/see often are when people choose the wrong 3rd party plugins to base their systems on.  npm makes it easy to install almost any module, and sometimes that low barrier makes for easy but less than stellar choices; its like anything research the module first and try real scenarios as a POC before committing.<p>Also there are other frameworks other than Express for Node, for example you can check out HAPI which some people have switched to for RESTful API work.",1385425869

Did you <i>read</i> the article I linked in the comment to which you replied? Have you ever read <i>anything</i> on the subject of the American eugenics movement? Or do you argue from this blatantly false premise in support of some ulterior motive? Perhaps you are ignorant; perhaps you are malicious; perhaps you are both. The facts of the matter being what they are, you cannot possibly be neither.<p>&quot;We never <i>did</i> any eugenics.&quot;<p>Your third paragraph beggars belief even further. Perhaps you aren&#x27;t aware that in California, the eugenic sterilization of prisoners was not made illegal until 1979 -- and the practice itself continued until <i>three years ago</i>.[1] And there&#x27;s far worse in the history of American eugenics -- circa twenty thousand free men and women sterilized, at the order of eugenics boards which judged them unfit to reproduce, in the state of California alone. Twenty <i>thousand</i>! Are they not enough for you to acknowledge this atrocity for what it is? How many more do you require?<p>&quot;We never <i>did</i> any eugenics.&quot;<p>The most generous assumption I can make is that your argument originates in a combination of dewy-eyed optimism regarding the advancement of human knowledge, and abysmal ignorance regarding history so recent it&#x27;s barely left the category of current events. Even then, your argument remains morally repugnant in the extreme -- you argue, in essence, that the American eugenics movement was and remains utterly blameless, pure and innocent of any wrongdoing, because after all it was the Third Reich, not the United States, who in accord with the soundest eugenic theory committed enormities hideous enough to rate among the very foulest blemishes of our species&#x27; far from stainless history.<p>Had the Nazi eugenics programs arisen <i>de novo</i>, had they been the entire invention of Nazi theorists working from Nazi first principles without any relation to the eugenic theories then in American vogue, you would have a point. But they did not; ignore it though you may, it remains established and incontrovertible fact that Nazi eugenics were in every sense an outgrowth from, and a development of, American eugenics -- and not merely in the realm of pure theory; the early Nazi eugenics programs received not merely intellectual support, but actual funding, from such luminaries as the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations.<p>American eugenicists trained Nazi eugenicists, collaborated with them, supplied them with funds, encouraged and abetted them in every possible fashion on their way to enormities such as &quot;Action T4&quot; -- a bloodless name for the eugenic murder of a third of a million unfortunates, that of course being only the figure known with certainty and very probably short of the real number of victims -- and even the scourging of the Jewish race itself.<p>On an individual level, such behavior might be called complicity to murder, perhaps conspiracy to murder, perhaps accessory before the fact of murder -- among the very gravest of crimes, even on that small scale. The same, scaled up to the level of whole societies, beggars description. And there you stand, bright-eyed and smiling, and blithely insisting that American eugenicists, American progressives, are pure as the driven snow, smirched by not the tiniest drop of the lakes and rivers and oceans of blood spilled in the name of their abominable theories. Our forebears, in their foolishness, unleashed horror beyond description and beyond compare. When they saw the enormities that resulted, it made them wise, and they laid down the tool which had turned so disastrously in their hands. Yet there you stand, smiling, ready to pick that tool up again. Tell me, how many millions will it take <i>this</i> time, to make you as wise as those who&#x27;ve gone before?<p>Oh, but of course, you cry, it won&#x27;t happen that way this time! After all, we&#x27;re so much better and smarter now than anyone before, and we will be ever so careful not to repeat the Nazi horror! And I have no doubt that&#x27;s true. After all, we&#x27;re so much better and smarter now than anyone before! And so, too, will be the new horror you unleash, and always with the most unimpeachable of good intentions:<p>&quot;We never <i>did</i> any eugenics.&quot;<p>---<p>Precisely what you mean by &quot;Reactionism&quot; I am not sure. I am no longer young enough to love chaos, and I am reasonably familiar with recent history; I suppose this might make me look reactionary on some subjects and from a certain point of view, but I have never since childhood dreamt of dignifying any opinion I might hold with a name involving either a majuscule or an &quot;-ism&quot;.<p>Your links, I&#x27;m afraid, shed little light on the matter.

But there have to be proximal factors; to be a bit reductive, no one is arguing that large companies pick randomly for the world of startups and them for millions of dollars. Perhaps the most immediate proximal factor is number of users or revenue or...whatever. You wouldn&#x27;t say, &quot;if it was <i>just</i> luck, companies would preform just as well whether they had users or not&quot;.<p>So the question with luck is how far down the causal ladder you start considering things inputs (i.e. things which may or may not influence the outcome) instead of outputs (i.e. things which might be the result of those inputs or of luck). So with YC, is that getting or not getting into YC is an input variable that we could check against success, or is getting a YC spot one of those proximal factors, and the luck was just in getting <i>that</i>, at least in part?<p>So the &quot;is it pure luck?&quot; question isn&#x27;t very well defined, but the GP&#x27;s argument might still be useful in answering it. Moreover--larger questions of luck aside--it would be helpful in determining whether the YC selection process is actually useful.

The relationship is greatly clarified by the notion of uniform circuit complexity, which makes it possible to prove an equivalence between a (carefully defined notion of) circuit complexity and Turing machine complexity.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know of a good online treatment of uniform circuit complexity.  I learnt it through a 1993 paper by Andy Yao, but that&#x27;s definitely not a good introductory reference!<p>In any case, in my book I&#x27;m using the term universal in the same way as people usually use it for circuits, i.e., it means the same thing as when people say that the NAND gate is universal for computation.  Hope that clarifies things.",1385424324

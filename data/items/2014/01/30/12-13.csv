7150339,comment,7149865,7149882,1,0,dalke,,,"To my knowledge, there is no evidence for the assertion that oversized brains is based on sexual preference. We see brain size enlargement across many mammals, and our brains are about what&#x27;s expected for a primate our size.<p>The title (&quot;large testicles are linked to infidelity&quot;) refers to a trend across species, but cannot be applied to members of a given species. For example, the giant panda is taxonomically a carivore, but 99% of what it eats is bamboo. Just because a skull type and digestive tract is linked to being a carnivore, doesn&#x27;t mean that the animal is that.<p>&quot;The female has also an opportunity to filter out those who will be permitted fatherhood, for example by having an orgasm.&quot; There are dozens of conjectures about female orgasms. Quoting from Wikipedia&#x27;s Orgasm#Theoretical_biological_and_evolutionary_functions :<p>> They quote primate sexuality specialist Alan Dixson in saying that the monogamy-maintenance explanation for female orgasm &quot;seems far-fetched&quot; because &quot;females of other primate species, and particularly those with multimale-multifemale [promiscuous] mating systems such as macaques and chimpanzees, exhibit orgasmic responses in the absence of such bonding or the formation of stable family units.&quot; On the other hand, Dixson notes that &quot;Gibbons, which are primarily monogamous, do not exhibit obvious signs of female orgasm.<p>These observations would suggest that the orgasm/permitting fatherhood hypothesis is incorrect.<p>&quot;If you have all your children with one man, influenza may kill all of them. However, if you mate with the neighbouring male as well, perhaps only some of the children will perish.&quot;<p>Again, this is one of many conjectures. Another is that women find it advantageous to sleep with many men because men will help raise their own children, and will help even if there&#x27;s only a 25% chance of the child being theirs.<p>(Also, I don&#x27;t think influenza infections are genetic in that way.)<p>The problem with all of these is that there&#x27;s no real evidence one way or another. As a result, it&#x27;s easy for cultural biases to strongly sway our interpretations. Take the term &quot;infidelity.&quot; That has two meanings: sex with someone other than one&#x27;s long-term partner, and the cultural and emotional expectations, leading to jealousy, that one won&#x27;t have sex except with one&#x27;s partner.<p>The phrase &quot;We can pledge our fidelity until we are blue in the face&quot; implies the second is true, but on evolutionary timescales there&#x27;s no justification for that belief that people 10,000 years ago followed the same cultural expectations. We know that different cultures right now do not.<p>It sounds like the goal of this exhibition is to get people to think about different possibilities. However, it&#x27;s also likely that the suggestions proffered reflect too much of the presenters&#x27; own biases rather than the diversity of hypotheses available.",1391086227

They are in financial difficulty, yes, but they are also responsible for broad social-health in the UK.<p>The NHS is in an almost unique position world-wide, in that they have access to high quality data that can dramatically improve health at an international level. They aren&#x27;t, however, a research group. Companies just do research better than government departments, and finding a balanced way to improve access to the data and improve social health is critical to the NHS&#x27;s future as the population ages.<p>This is why they are selling health data, imho.<p>I think there&#x27;s a balance to be struck.

From an economic perspective one could argue that the value of privacy can be inferred by the value of the lack thereof. I am not strictly of this opinion, but let&#x27;s assume that works as a heuristic for argument&#x27;s sake. Still the problem is that I am leaning towards the opinion that information has no intrinsic value and value comes from the processes that surround its use. Improvements in information processing capacity would therefore increase the value of privacy but we would also not be able to assert a value on our own privacy not knowing how the information that breaches it is used.<p>The truth is that privacy is much more complex to assess. In the context of our social existence we customarily sacrifice parts of our privacy to assert identity. On the other hand we do so in communication contexts. Communication has attributes that limit its scope (geographical, temporal etc.) It is very difficult to understand the impact of the acceptance of an overarching and limitless communication context, whether that is with a company or with a government.<p>If you are interested in the outputs of my research do not hesitate to pm me and I will keep you posted.",1391084262

However, empirical evidence for it is rare. Here, using an adaptive dynamics approach to evolution, we explore conditions under which such disease-induced mating enhancement is (or is not) likely to occur. We find that increased mating success is less likely to evolve if the host reproduction rate, or the baseline disease transmission rate, is reduced, and the parasite affects just one sex, compared to when it affects both. We also find that it is less likely to evolve if the virulence-transmission trade-off curve is stronger, since we assume that enhanced disease transmission can only be achieved at the cost of increased virulence and as this trade-off is concave. In addition, we demonstrate that if disease-induced mating enhancement is equally acting in both sexes the mating system has no effect on evolutionary outcomes. On the contrary, if disease-induced mating enhancement is acting in just one sex, the potential for its evolution increases with the degree of polygyny in the host population. To study the examined phenomenon in greater detail we encourage further empirical research on this apparently less explored impact of sexually transmitted parasites on host fitness.",1391084187

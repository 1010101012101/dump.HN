25771,comment,25628,25628,0,0,tx,,,"How can you so blindly proclaim something like this? In a world of systems programming I got used to people posting stack traces with milliseconds attached to each function call, complaining about something <i>specific</i>. A good example would be GNU glibc's printf() function checking system locale on every call.<p>Have you ever done any programming before?<p>Your claim <i>Active Record is slow</i> sounds almost like <i>my computer is slow</i>. How do you know it was ActiveRecord? How  did you benchmark? Was it even RoR? Maybe you had another process spinning in an endless loop in the background eating your CPU.\n",1180657671

We have no search facilities so things like this are bound to happen. You could try looking for the search page (somewhere) but it's spidering is always behind the posting. The only alternative is for a live search to be added to the page. <p>Btw I've fallen down in the same way ~ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=24506"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=24506</a>",1180657190

If you don't like it, that's fine, don't use it, but to just go around posting completely unproven slander about a completely free project is another matter completely. <p>I love that there are some people here that seem to think they are entitled to something or that 37s or DHH owes you something. It's open source, you have 3 options:\n1. Fix it and get kudos.\n2. Don't fix it (because your either too dumb or too lazy) and work around it.\n3. Don't use it.<p>But coming on here and making some generalized proclamation that RoR is slow is irresponsible and unacceptable, IMO.",1180656841

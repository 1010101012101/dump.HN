It's kind of like the Rails mass assignment or security bug: merchants are just going to have to stay on top of Bitcoin issues.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1a51xx/now_that_its_over_the_blockchain_fork_explained"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1a51xx/now_that_its...</a><p><pre><code>  [Submitted March 12]\n\n  It's DanielTaylor again and I wanted to create a simple yet \n  intuitive post to explain the folks out there what happened  \n  a couple of hours ago. This might also be useful for \n  bloggers or journalists who might be going to write about \n  it in the following hours.\n\n  TL;DR\n\n  The programs that read the blockchain, the bitcoin ledger, \n  disagree.\n\n  Due to a bug in 0.7, it says that HIS is the correct \n  version of this ledger and 0.8 says that HIS is the correct \n  version.\n\n  Miners (the people who add pages to the blockchain) are \n  told to switch to the 0.7 program so that this version \n  gains more support and the other one is discarded. \n  (orphaned).\n\n  Regular users are not affected. Their transactions are \n  included in both ledgers and don't need to change any \n  programs.\n\n  During that time, though, there is a slight chance of a \n  double-spend ocurring. That is why people recommended \n  merchants and exchanges to wait until there is one single \n  blockchain again before processing purchases and \n  merchandise.\n\n  ...\n\n  What's a double-spend?\n\n  This is the reason why some merchants and exchanges stopped   \n  processing incoming bitcoins for a couple of hours.\n\n  The bitcoin network prevents people from spending the same \n  coins by mantaining this unique ledger, the blockchain. But \n  now that there were two of them, it was theoretically \n  possible to broadcast two different transactions with the \n  same coins and still get some confirmations.\n\n  With some luck, someone could sneakily sneakily* buy a \n  television to a merchant who was reading the 0.8 ledger and \n  have the transaction confirmed. At the same time he could \n  have sent the same coins back to himself and, with some \n  luck, have the transaction confirmed on the 0.7 ledger.\n\n  What happens is that, in the end when 0.7 wins, the thief \n  will have the television and his bitcoins. Remember that \n  there were two different versions of the same coins!\n\n  This is not something easy to do and requires a lot of luck \n  because the blocks mined (the pages added to the ledger)  \n  must be mined precisely in the correct order. But still, in \n  this situation it was easier to pull off and so it was \n  recommended for merchants and exchanges to temporarily stop \n  processing incoming transactions.\n\n  Now the situation has resolved and the blockchain keeps \n  growing happily, page by page, block y block.</code></pre>",1363265389

Those who can tolerate financial volatility and change and social upheaval (MacLeod Sociopaths) start to trade risk with those who don't want it (MacLeod Losers). The risk-seekers become the entrepreneurs; the risk-averse become workers. This is benign for a while, but as the company becomes stable, the upper class becomes entitled, established, and complacent. They want to keep the perceived risk trade going, but the business is actually de-risked, so now they're just grabbing for unjustified or legacy superiority. They've won, and now they want to <i>stay</i> where they are. In order to keep the risk-transfer between them and the (expectancy-sacrificing) Losers, they have to create a middling buffer class of Clueless. This style of organization becomes resistant to change, systemically underperforming, and bland, but it's <i>extremely</i> stable on its own terms. People don't want the jobs above them enough to break the rules. Losers (who value comfort and stability) see the ranks above them as being harder, riskier, and are happy to stay put. Clueless are oblivious to the Effort Thermocline (the point in an organization where jobs become <i>easier</i>-- but also more political-- with ascending rank instead of harder) and run the organizational day-to-day while oblivious to the agendas of the Sociopaths above them.<p>The most common end state of this is the organization with the full MacLeod hierarchy: Losers at the bottom, Clueless in the middle, Sociopaths at the top. It's a mature rank culture where position and subordinacy matter more than creative excellence and technical improvement. But why?<p>The process is complex, but the truth is that this form of organizational corruption was, for a long time, <i>harmless</i> from a business perspective. When you're providing commodity products or services, the MacLeod rank culture works. It does the job.<p>What's changing (first in software, increasingly in other areas of business) is the convexity switch. Concave work is work on which the difference between excellence and mediocrity is insignificant compared to that between mediocrity and zero. It's ""get-it-done"" commodity work where creativity isn't necessary or even useful. Convex work is that in which the difference between excellence and mediocrity is huge, and mediocrity is close to (or might be) zero.<p>The difference between the (winding down) industrial and (soon to come) technological eras is the convexity of the work that the world needs. In the industrial era, most needed work was concave and the hierarchical MacLeod organization worked well. In the technological era in which the commodity work has been given to machines (who do it far more reliably and cheaply than any human) what's left is <i>convex</i> work. Traditional industrial management, though successful for 200 years, just falls down. The reason why is that it's all about reducing variance. For concave work, variation is mostly to the downside, and variance-reduction (the goal of most management) improves expectancy. For concave work, variance is mostly to the upside, and variance-reducing management drives expectancy to zero.",1363264404

Would they read the paper you were mentioned in?).<p>A lot of your PR activities are about building up mindshare.  Hardly anybody remembers a site or company the first time (or two!) they read about it.  But after 6 or 8 mentions of your site/company in various places, the name starts to stick.<p>I have personally done product demos and interviews for articles for the WSJ, Boston Globe, dozen of trade mags, and TV spots (8 hours of filming for a 5 minute segment that didn't end up airing).  Keep doing what you're doing and someone will run across one of your spots and think ""I've been hearing a lot about this site, I guess I should maybe pay attention now"".  Eventually you'll find your efforts have paid off, even though it's a frog boil and you won't be able to define the precise inflection point.<p>It's a marathon, not a sprint.<p>Also, as soon as you can afford the ~$10K/mo, hire a PR firm.  They're way better at this than you and already have the connections and know the ins and outs.  Yes, you can do it on your own, but this is an example, IMO, of an activity prime for outsourcing.",1236166866

He had worked in the financial sector before, and had conducted research that showed that around 90% (Don't remember the exact number) of excel files in the financial sector had mistakes in them.

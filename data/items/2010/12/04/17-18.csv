You're looking for the mentalities of founders to become employees, and when someone can partner with someone in university or down at the local coffee shop and apply for Y Combinator, work the same hours and put the same effort in on their own company, instead of grinding in an already established company, I'm betting the best minds will do the latter.<p>Correct me if I'm wrong on that, there might be a wealth of super-talented, super-dedicated workers who aren't confident to run their own company yet, but I would imagine that anyone willing to work crazy hours, solving complex online problems, with the low cost of launching a product nowadays, they're going to try that (at least first).",1291485519

My antagonism was mostly in jest since I vaguely remembered your name, but I also believe in discussions without arguments from authority.<p>2. Lisp can eval a string that has been constructed at runtime.  That's kind of the point of a repl, for example, which can be implemented by compiling each unit of input to native code before executing it.<p>3. The Python community shuns the use of eval.  Are you really claiming that Python's eval is used in fundamentally more dynamic ways than Lisp's?  Or is it that Lisp's eval usually operates on input that is constructed differently?  Or that Lispers tend not to put eval in an inner loop, but some important Python programs do?  I understand that there are attributes of Python that make compilation hard compared to a Lisp, but I'm not aware of something that makes it impossible or guarantees that compilation cannot be performant.

That will do better if the data wasn't random.<p>Or if you're expecting random data, invent a biased compression algorithm and use that (e.g. one that has shortcuts for storing any multiples of 3). Most of the time it will do nothing and a few times you'll randomly get data it's good at.<p>Actually on second thought I'm not sure if that works or not. You'll need a header to identify if the compression was used or not. So the compression has to save more on average than this header info costs.<p>This header problem becomes clearer if you try to chain thousands of special-case compression algorithms that map a single input to one bit and otherwise are unused. Seems to save space at first (at cost of CPU time, and space to store these algorithms), but actually identifying which are used or not will be a problem. Since they all need unique headers, you need just as many header possibilities as there are numbers in the range, so you must as well just use the numbers for the headers, at which case you're actually not doing anything since the header is the data.",1291482294

1969604,comment,1968611,1969456,0,0,sudont,,,"I’m not smart enough to think of a solution. Interface builder in Xcode works because everything’s based on cartesian coordinates, but other than pages starting from top-left, HTML is really based around flowing and cascading.<p>Maybe it’s possible, CSSEdit works great, but requires the HTML to be set up. Espresso’s node layout works well to show hierarchy, but still requires manual HTML editing. One solution would be similar to creating nested NSViews, but turning off {position:absolute} by default. This would force the designer to think in a way that’s similar to how web pages flow in the real world, instead of throwing absolutely positioned elements into a static frame.<p>I’d have to say some sort of blob state file would be the best bet. The designer works in a vector environment that emphasizes mutable viewports, elements and element amounts. Basically dashcode with vector built in.",1291482168

This means by default Erlang concurrency primitives work beyond a single node, Clojure&#x27;s don&#x27;t.<p>Well actually Erlang is not single-threaded it is multi-scheduler  and multi-process. CPU or OS based threads are used for scheduler and processes (possibly hundreds of thousands of them) run on all of them.<p>Moreover processes are very small memory wise (only a few K) and _most importantly_ have isolated heaps (yes, all while running in the same OS-level process.<p>What you are mentioning there is called &quot;distribution&quot;.  This is what allows you to send a message to another Erlang process, running on a different machine, different continent and have it look like Pid ! Msg which is exactly how you&#x27;d send a message to a local Erlang process as well.",1404025125

Nothing you wrote says anything about you,<p>OK, let me try; I really like computers back in the day when you typed in a terminal screen 1:Print &quot;Hello World&quot; or the first HTML page with the CSS or figuring out for the first time how object-oriented programming class inheritance working, or referencing and dereferencing C pointers or DirectX buffer-swap or socket multicasting, or reading a really profound novel for English class for that matter or catching a late night movie with sexy scenes and heavy themes that you can&#x27;t put your finger when you&#x27;re young but the excitement of lust and wanderlust lingers on (&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;),<p>When real life happened was told by parents directly and peers implicitly to &quot;pursue&quot; passion and  &quot;be serious&quot; at the same time lest you be judged, so I got a job feeling independent, hell even making six-figures for the first time, feeling a million bucks but initial euphoria eventually gave away to daily grind, fixing tickets after tickets to the tyranny of &quot;agile,&quot; &quot;daily standup,&quot; and &quot;JIRA burndown chart/project tracker&quot;; more importantly, I want to learn and dig further and further down into stack, get into Linux kernel, hardware circuit design, cryptography, Bioinformatics not to have some BS on my LinkedIn and collect trinkets, but have that rush of hacking at it, like a shot of cocaine straight into the brain blood-barrier; instead, I&#x27;m here cranking out tickets for an A/B test on how to make a button to have a single round bevel or double round bevel and seeing which one will boost 0.01% on the user conversion rate to add a product to a shopping cart or to keep user &quot;as engaged&quot; when I could hardly care less about social media, e-commerce and iOS apps about a product or infographics that I don&#x27;t need but is shoved to my face; I feel cheated and robbed at the lies that the startup industry pumps out for &quot;meaningful work,&quot; more importantly, I sacrificed my love for learning academic-oriented computing for a meaningless momentary compensation and the trendiness of startupdom because I watched some stupid video on Steve Jobs or Peter Thiel on some late lonely night and it filled up my emptiness in college,<p>Socially, was an awkward computer nerd and on the bottom of the sexual and social totem-pole in college. But had a few friends whom I can have late night conversations with, who listened to me, whom understood when I say something in Chinglish (English-Cinese combined) and understand instantly what it&#x27;s like to grow up Chinese in suburban Maryland and going to a Chinese evangelical christian church in the late 90&#x27;s, and debating what porn clip we saw on porn sites back then, whether it&#x27;s sanitary or gay for the guys involved for the porn girl in a blowbang to suck one cock and then go off to suck on another cock and also discuss different movies, The Smashing Pumpkins, &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; &quot;On the Road,&quot; the alienation and the exhilaration of being on the road or constantly searching and wandering and the explicit sexual yearnings,<p>So in my mid-twenties, got finally frustrated due to hormones and that fear of missing out and that parental pressure to &quot;settle down&quot;. So I got an downtown apartment and stocked it up with IKEA furniture like Edward Norton did in &quot;Fight Club,&quot; shopped at H&M and Brooks Brothers for &quot;snug-fit&quot; jeans, befriended and went out with a carefully curated group of &quot;young professionals but yet boheme&quot;  and eventually went on dates that led to a steady girlfriend. At first I felt like a million bucks, felt like I finally made it with &quot;meaningful such yuppie weekend activities&quot; as rock-climbing, hiking and carousing with friends and SO but eventually gave to the daily grind of the socializations, to the pettiness of who&#x27;s who in office politics, whose next great startup idea to apply to what accelerator and what band to see in which cool fresh new venue that&#x27;s just opened in the city but that&#x27;s just the same as the one that we just sat at discussing it, the decor, names and hair are different but the characters all the same, that obligatory feeling that I don&#x27;t want to but I should,<p>I want to have a feeling of mastery, follow through with something tangible and tactile with my hands, like building a nice outdoors deck with a nice varnish finish, learn how to take a Eric-Clapton-esque solo with all of the chromatic tones and sixteenth notes at a blues jam, to pull off a cross-over and a spin-move to evade the first and second defender in a rec-league basketball and finish at the hoop. Instead I trivialized my personal goals as unrealistic and impractical and instead gave into the social pressure of &quot;practical nest-building and social networking&quot;. Learned only later that all my &quot;friends&quot; in trendy yuppie network were more in love with the idea of themselves being involved in a trendy yuppie network than the other people (especially moi). I don&#x27;t feel like a man, or specifically a human being with any agency, but was re-assured by everyone else that &quot;[I was]. Because [I] had my own apartment and had a great job, a great social network.&quot; I rushed to relationships and friends to fill a void of personal inadequacy but found associating or possessing other people that I liked the idea of did not change me and if anything else made me more insecure and co-dependent on them.",1404025055

I, too share this thinking through.<p>Beside doing things you regret when drunk - like making an ass out of yourself when talking to more sober people in bars or feeling shitty the next day... it does not make you experience yourself as a better person when sober. You have to be drunk to be that better person. So you drink. It does not help - at least that&#x27;s my experience. Getting drunk can be fun but...where to stop?<p>Being outgoing for me is strongly connected to my self-esteem and feeling of self-worth. If it&#x27;s down the drain I hardly leave the house and run away from social interactions without alcohol. If I accumulated some self-worth and feeling fine with myself I enjoy going out and being social in a sober state even more.<p>I doubt that you are more socially awkward for other people when sober but your anxiety makes you so uncomfortable that you have this urge to grab a drink and have a feeling of relaxation. After a few beers you feel better...<p>Be careful it&#x27;s a vicious circle and it&#x27;s worth to spend some energy into forcing yourself into social situation in a sober state. It can be fun to sit sober in a bar and watch all the people getting more and more drunk.",1404024957

7960508,comment,7959660,7959660,7,0,kentonv,,,"Here&#x27;s how Android could fix its permission system:<p>Take contact lists as an example.<p>Many programs request access to your contact list. Usually, this is so that they can display back to you a contact picker that lets you choose some set of contents which you want to share with, or otherwise invite to use the app. A few bad apps will just spam your contacts without your approval.<p>How could we make this more secure? Well, imagine that Android itself implemented a contact picker API. Instead of requesting access to contacts upfront, a program would call an API to say &quot;Please ask the user to select some contacts for purpose X&quot;. The platform itself would then render a contact picker UI, and the user would pick some contacts. Only the chosen contacts would be returned to the app.<p>As far as the user is concerned, for legitimate apps, the UX I described is exactly the same as what they get now, except that the app doesn&#x27;t have to request general access to the user&#x27;s contact list upfront, and thus the whole thing is more secure. It&#x27;s strictly superior! And this approach -- of inferring security from decisions the user is making anyway, by making those decisions happen in privileged UIs rendered by the platform -- turns out to extend to far more than just contacts.<p>This is the model I&#x27;m currently implementing in <a href=""https://sandstorm.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sandstorm.io</a> (a platform that can be summarized as &quot;Android for your personal server&quot;).",1404023247

You don&#x27;t have to ship a perfect device, but you do have to provide support for security critical patches for a certain time frame. It seems beyond reckless, certainly unethical, borderline negligent, to ship a smartphone and then just leave it exposed as known vulnerabilities pile up.<p>Once we&#x27;re talking about phones with a certain level of sophistication, I think 3 years of auto-pushed security updates is not too much to ask! To me, it&#x27;s a minimum requirement of any device I would buy, but the average consumer has no idea how vulnerable their device actually becomes over time.",1404023009

Add Siri support, saving EQ settings to firmware via iPhone (as Parrot Zik can) and (if I&#x27;m allowed to dream) Wi-fi based Airplay support, and I&#x27;m hooked. Currently they&#x27;re an expensive pair of headphones, but I&#x27;ll point out one thing -- you don&#x27;t need to get rid of the TRS jack to use the lightning port. This article really is pure rumours and speculation.<p>And that lighting two-way power draw seems a useful tool for more than just headphones. Watches anyone?",1404022919

</code></pre>
You're equating the killing of animals with the death of animals. The
animals that died eons ago to make oil were not killed by beings that
had an active choice to make (i.e. ""Do I kill this animal, or do I not
kill this animal?""). An animal that died of natural causes was not
killed, and a T-Rex (or a lion for that matter) does not have a moral
dilemma when it comes to mealtime.<p>The only possible exception here is if you wish to postulate that some
or all of the animals that crude oil comes from were killed by
intelligent (and sentient) extra-terrestrial or terrestrial beings that
left no trace behind for us to find.<p>I'm also clueless as to why you question if it's ok to kill an animal
for no reason and not consume it. Most of the animal-based products that
we have on the market today come from animals that humans have raised,
and killed for the expressed purpose of creating that product. Do you
not realize that these animals would <i>not</i> be killed if there were no
demand for these products (or at least only a demand for similar
products that were not animal-based -- e.g. faux leather).<p><pre><code>  > 2. I'm primarily attempting to point out that your actions and your

</code></pre>
So you advocate ad hominem attacks on people based on some sort of
stereotype that you have in your own mind, but which really doesn't
match reality? As others have stated, you're trying to take the
adjective 'vegan' and create your own definition of it based on the
negative view you have of what <i>some</i> of the people it describes
believe.<p>To use a religion analogy, you're trying to condemn all Christians based
on the actions of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church in no way
represents all Christian religions, but they are seen as the 'canonical'
Christian religion in most people's minds. But in this case it's even
worse, because the view points that you are attacking aren't even
associated with some proper group or institution. It's just a view point
that <i>some</i> people who are vegetarian/vegan hold.<p><pre><code>  > 4. I think that voting is largely ineffective and that the electoral

</code></pre>
Where did I define my moral code for your review? Yet you assume that
you know what it is, and attempt to viciously attack it to (presumably)
gain some sort of personal satisfaction that you have 'proved' that you
are right and someone else is wrong on the internet?<p>I also question why you are attempting to tell others that their moral
code should be black-and-white. Is you own personal moral code this
black-and-white? Is murder is always murder, and self-defense is no
excuse? Or do you allow an exception in that case? A picture of a naked
child is always child pornography, even if it's just the 'classic'
bathtime photo of a baby? Are these not 'arbitrary exceptions?'",1290545776

I think some meth use among employees, but tracked items show up.  It's not safe to get mail with handwritten addresses, things like birthday cards with a little cash in the middle always vanish.  And the DMV license plate tags vanish in the mail too... California no doubt has a black market for those with so many illegals from Mexico around.  
Their flat rate boxes are extremely competitive for shipping, especially heavier items and/or to distant zones.  Mail service has been reliable since one local thief was caught.  Many good people don't deserve a bad rap for the actions of a small number.<p>UPS gives generally great service, but they throw the packages around.  Some electronic gear with glass meters on the side arrived with the glass broken.  Taking the unit apart revealed it was more than just a bump to the side of the thick box.  The power transformer had the brackets stretched up and it was leaning a great deal.  For that to happen the package wasn't just bumped or even dropped.  It was clearly thrown horizontally and down with considerable force and crash landed... like onto a dock or truck.
UPS seems to have become much more costly than in years past.<p>Fedex is much more gentle with packages, but it's alarming how many from neighbors blocks away show up.

This blogger assumes that all methane from cows will be released into the atmosphere like in the factory model when it is in a big pile by itself. This assumption does not hold when the cow manure is spread out and worked into the soil by nature. Methane is probably the least of our concerns in such a comparison anyways- there is a much greater damage done to find and burn all the fossil fuel for the fertilizer to grow the grains with and other energy used in this process- by some estimates a calorie of factory farmed meat comes from 10 calories of oil.
Compare this to grass fed meat where most of the energy input is solar to grow the grass, and the topsoil actually grows instead of being slowly degraded while growing grains.<p>I am really not going to bother debating a ridiculous comparison of eating meat with slavery. It is essential for our health and we don't need to feel bad about it when we aren't destroying the environment or torturing animals.",1290543378

That said, even though with the wsgi adapter you've neutered what tornado is famous for (evented python framework), it is a nice concise web framework with a flexible templating system that is easy to grok and get working quickly, yet still has some nice features like UI modules, named url matching with reverse_url construction, xsrf protection and secure (in the sense that they are unforgeable) cookies.  Its templating system doesn't auto escape, so we hacked it to do so.<p>Using a minimalist framework is a pretty good match for app engine since other frameworks might assume something about the environment that won't be true of GAE.<p>And you can always mix in other ala cart libraries.  For instance, we use wtforms.  That combined with a tornado UI module to render the forms nicely has been a effective.<p>If I were to choose again, I might just use the built in web.py since they often include utility handlers for things like parsing multipart uploads; we've had to reimplement those for our tornado BaseHandler.

Remote-wipe is part of the technical contract you enter into when you link your phone to your company's internal infrastructure. Therefore, while it's <i>totally reasonable</i> to be outraged at the prospect of your employer wiping your phone, the answer is simply ""don't let them"".<p>Why do IT departments need this capability? That's easy: when you synced your phone up to their email system, you collected an unspecified number of company secrets. Some of those secrets come with a legal obligation to safeguard them. In a surprisingly large number of companies, some of those obligations have theoretical criminal penalties attached to them.<p>Turning off your Exchange access doesn't get rid of secrets Exchange disclosed to you already. Companies turn over tens or even hundreds of employees a week. It's absurd to suggest that they'd leave this matter up to chance, with or without a ""scrub your device regularly"" policy.<p>More to the point: when companies lose PI, PII, or financials, they end up in the newspaper. Usually, when there's even a <i>reasonable likelihood</i> that data has been exposed, companies are required to notify impacted business partners, incurring contractual and legal expenses. Even if you just left the phone in a bar, and the thief is almost certainly just going to wipe the phone anyways. It's naive to suggest that companies accept the risk of landing in the paper or in court <i>every time someone loses a phone.</i><p>It's also perfectly reasonable to point out (bad) IT departments that require you to tie your personal phone to their email systems.

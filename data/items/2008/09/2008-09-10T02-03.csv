The connections and being able to bounce ideas off of other really smart people was invaluable as well.<p>What's really hard for many founders (myself very much included) is telling your friends and family you're leaving this good job with health care benefits to do a startup. Having a name behind you makes this a lot easier; the YC money was almost irrelevant.",1221015399

300034,comment,299903,300008,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"As Guy stated, for most companies, going the YC route qualifies as plan B more than plan A.  Two guys living in their parents basement and giving up 6% for 15 - 20k so they can scrape by for six months is a far cry from giving up 30 - 40% for $1-2m so you can hire five people and burn through that money in less than a year building a product for all the users you're sure you're going to get.",1221014972
300033,comment,299720,299822,0,0,sgrove,,,"I suppose it's a bit of an image problem - ""startup"" has a ""small guy"" nuance to it, a group still struggling and fighting to get their model right.
If it begins with already well-established industry players, I would less associate it with ""startup"", and perhaps simply classify it as a company.<p>It may very well be a meaningless bias from frequenting hn and the groups I hang out with, reflecting a bit more.",1221014955
300032,comment,299618,300028,0,0,ardit33,,,"here is somebody's counterpoint:<p>""It seems to me that AJAX can be used to solve this problem in a simpler
manner. Take Gmail for example--it downloads the whole UI once and then uses
AJAX to get the state-specific data. The example from the PPT showed a 40%
reduction in the number of bytes transmitted when using SDCH (beyond what
GZIP provided) for google SERPs. I bet you could do about that well just by
AJAXifying the SERPs (making them more like GMail) + using regular HTTP
cache controls + using a compact, application-specific data format for the
dynamic parts of the page + GZIP. Maybe Google's AJAX Search API already
does that? In fact, you might not even need AJAX for this; maybe IFRAMEs are
enough.<p>I also noticed that this proposal makes the request and response HTTP
headers larger in an effort to make entity bodies smaller. It seems over
time there is an trend of increasingly large HTTP headers as applications
stuff more and more metadata into them, where it is not all that unusual for
a GET request to require more than one packet now, especially when longish
URI-encoded IRIs are used in the message header. Firefox cut down on the
request headers it sends [2] specifically to increase the chances that GET
requests are small enough to fit in one packet. Since HTTP headers are
naturally <i>highly</i> repetitive (especially for resources from the same
server), a mechanism that could compress them would be ideal. Perhaps this
could be recast as transport-level compression so that it could be deployed
as a TLS/IPV6/IPSEC compression scheme.<p>Regards,
Brian

300028,comment,299618,299618,0,0,ardit33,,," I read the whole thing, and I just don't like it.  The beauty of HTTP headers, cookies, and elements is their simplicity  (or primitivness).  They are easy to implement.<p>This proposal will introduce a huge complexity to the HTTP spec. If you have implemented caching in a client, it is so easy for things to go wrong,  even if the clients are right, the server, content managers could mess this up roaly really fast.<p>The other thing I don't like, is that when using raw sockets, and try to implement HTTP over it,  (many reasons to do this, especially in mobile), now you have to deal with more complexities.<p>As somebody mentioned above, eliminating duplicate http headers, and addressing the duplicity issue in the markup language itself  (i.e HTML5 or XHTML2), and not the transport protocol.",1221014580

All that efficient market theory states is that information is communicated efficiently, not that the information is correct.  Other bubbles would never happen.<p>Proponents state that prices are only correct in the long run.  Malkiel (author of A Random Walk) advocates whole market index funds simply because you cannot know what information is correct and beating the market is a fool's errand.  Again the case in point being the irrational run up in tech stocks not based on fundamentals but based on the greater fool theory.  Information as pricing was communicated effectively but the information is not guaranteed to be either correct or rational.<p>The stock market is a weighing machine not a voting machine - Benjamin Graham.<p>However, I do enjoy Cuban's take on this as he's been there and down that.

Usually it will be slightly different between <img> <script> <link> and <iframe>, but this probably wouldn't make much of a difference if you allow only to send changed headers.  I'd be curious to see how much bandwidth you save with this.  You also might want to allow for header removal as you do header change.  I can't think of a scenario where not removing a header would cause a problem, but there could potentially be one.<p>For the gzip as a whole instead of per request, there's one reason I can't see many browsers taking advantage of that.  Most browsers will make requests like, write request, read response, write request, read response.  Instead of write, write, write, read, read, read.  So I'm not sure how you could unzip everything together unless you wait to display the items till the entire connection is finished.  Also, this would require the client to give an indication when it is done writing requests to the stream, so that all the data can be fetched from the server and then zipped together.  Which would require a much bigger change to the protocol.<p>Is there anything I'm missing?",1221013265

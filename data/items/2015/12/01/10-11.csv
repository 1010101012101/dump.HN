More often than not, as soon as I finish paying for the food and pick up some straws/napkins, my number is called. Given all the mentioned attributes, it&#x27;s an amazing feat and I&#x27;m ever more impressed with innovations that Mcz come up with. Part of this speed comes from when they switched to keeping ingredients of a burger in temperature controlled trays ready for assembly. This also had a bonus side effect: the food is always at a consumable temperature when served, never too hot or too cold. Compare this with your run of the mill restaurant where you have wait an extra 10 minutes after the food is served, so it doesn&#x27;t burn your tongue off.<p>Also, since Mcz is always under spotlight given its enormity as a company, they have nutritional information for every product. Now tell me, how do I know how much saturated fat I&#x27;m being fed in one of those fancy restaurants. Ask them? I did a few times. They didn&#x27;t know it themselves.",1448965654

At work I've been doing a lot of technical interviewing, and there seem to be lots of people hiring good programmers.<p>On the other hand, these are some persistent layoffs.<p>Are the workers made unnecessary by either lowered product demand or increases in productivity?  The former means a big % of our economy could depend on a boom/bubble structure.  The latter means that these people will need some serious retraining/adjustment before they're back in the workforce.",1257566206

Yeah, he was a good programmer, but he just ran a website with some modest success.  Several of us have done the same.<p>I've heard the same applies to other leading programmer luminaries, eg. John Carmack.<p>Somewhere along the line, some programmers start really distinguishing themselves while others remain merely ""good"".  And I don't think it has to do with ploughing all your efforts into one project.  People like Brad Fitzpatrick, Jamie Zawinski, Paul Buchheit, or Rob Pike are known for <i>multiple</i> contributions.  Is it just the cumulative effects of time, or is there something specific they do with their time that propels them from good to great?",1257565844

Also, the government will only accept dollars for taxes/fees. So you could legally refuse dollars if you wanted to, but if you did so, the other person could just say ""I tried to pay but he wouldn't let me"" and walk away. But if the other person wants to pay you in some other way... with Blah Bucks... and you accept them, nothing illegal happened. It would just be considered bartering.<p>I'm not sure I'd want a currency backed by my local bank. At least I know the US government and by extension the Federal Reserve <i>can't go bankrupt, rendering my money worthless</i> (although it's true they could hyperinflate, by choice).

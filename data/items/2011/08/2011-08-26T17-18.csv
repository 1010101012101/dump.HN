Although I think that the pretty graphics are mostly for show, the real power will be the ability to customize gestures for any application, and the utility you get out of these gestures can well be worth looking down at a ""mouse screen.""<p>I'm imagining being able to manipulate a CAD model in isolation, freely rotating items in PowerPoint, redistributing power among throttle/lasers/shields using sliding bars (X-wing, anyone?)...I'm sure there are many more.<p>I'd almost argue to keep a normal track pad for dedicated cursor navigation and have the awesome set of touchscreens as a peripheral.

2929262,comment,2927784,2929183,5,0,kragen,,,"The issue, as I understand it, is that you need to know whether an identifier in certain contexts is a type name or not. C99 increases the number of contexts.  Consider:<p><pre><code>    x * y;
</code></pre>
If x is a type, this declares y as a pointer to elements of that type, if you're at the beginning of a block or in C99.  If x is a variable, this is a multiplication in void context, unless you're at the top level of the translation unit.  A somewhat more interesting example is<p><pre><code>    x *f();
</code></pre>
which may declare f or call it, depending on what x is.  Of course, lacking the ability to overload the multiplication operator, there's no reason you'd ever do a multiplication in void context, but it is <i>legal</i>.<p>If your lexer can distinguish type names from other identifiers, the problem is solved, and you can use BNF from there.",1314381447

The most important thing about a round planet in this case (and, in fact, the reason planets tend towards roundness) is that it means gravity is (roughly) equal at every point on the surface (and, in fact, at every point on any planet-shaped shell inside it, as well).  On a cube, this is entirely gone.  The centers of the faces would have the strongest gravities; the corners would have the weakest.

2929172,comment,2925609,2927940,2,0,dgreensp,,,"There are ways this story fails in practice, like the ""language mismatch"" I mentioned.<p>For example, in Google Web Toolkit, which compiles Java to JavaScript, theoretically the static type information should be a huge boon to optimization.  And indeed, the compiler does some fancy stuff, including static inlining, and segmenting the code so that chunk 2 is only downloaded when a method call crosses the boundary of chunk 1.<p>However, consider something like a HashMap.  A JavaScript programmer might use a single JS object as a hash, whereas the GWT programmer has the luxury of using a java.util.HashMap, which is theoretically compiled down to something efficient, maybe just as efficient.  In practice, this is hard or impossible for the compiler, and HashMaps are compiled to a system of objects that's much more complex.  There are great reasons for this -- primarily, HashMaps can have any object as a key, not just a string; also the nature of the HashMap API and behavior under subclassing -- but the result is if you want something fast, you need to use a FastStringMap or some such class, backed by a ""native"" JS object.  But in general, when you're not worrying about performance, you might find yourself using many HashMaps, even parsing JSON into nested HashMaps!  So now each JS object is represented by a <i>bunch</i> of JS objects needed to make the mechanics of the HashMap abstraction work.<p>I worry that not having arrays leads to a similar problem.  In magic happy land, a call like List.pop that removes the last element of a list would be implemented as a tail-recursive operation on heads and tails, which the compile would then recognize and turn back into a call to Array.pop!  In practice, this kind of thing is unlikely.  As with HashMaps, the programmer is forced (or told) to use heavyweight data structures to simulate lightweight ones, with the hope that the compiler will recognize that this is a case where the lightweight structure applies and transform it back!<p>As for ""online"" compilation, I guess this is easier on the JVM.  Clojure, Rhino, Scala, and Java are all compiled and can be set up to recompile on the fly after every change to the program.  Node.js too.  Having developed this way, I don't think I could go back to having to do anything after changing the code besides reloading the page.",1314379856

I think you're mixed up here.  The JVM already optimizes classes and interfaces.

Fashioning aluminum, cadmium, silicon, and lithium is <i>way</i> more predictable than discovering a pharmaceutically-treatable, financially-lucrative metabolic disease.<p>There are certainly smart, extremely hard-working individuals in the biotechnology fields --- perhaps surpassing Mr. Jobs in those qualities, and some we'd certainly label as ""geniuses"" --- but the fantastically low probability of making even one genuine discovery, and the low odds of successfully developing that into a product, make the kind of serial successes of Apple and Mr. Jobs very unlikely in the biotech field. Biology results just don't flow that easily. Also, there is no clearcut equivalent in biological research to outbidding your competitors for the latest components, streamlining your manufacturing and inventory processes, and relying on economies of scale.<p>I can say this now only with the benefit of hindsight: my negative answer to bh42222's question stems from the fact that we just haven't observed such figure emerge in the last few decades. Craig Venter is a good example to look at. He certainly earned a great victory in the human genome sequencing (and the underlying technologies), but he lacks even a second notable success of that magnitude. It will probably be the purview of someone else to find the utility in the sequenced genome. Dean Kamen may be a prototype figure of this sort, but as nice as his individual inventions are, no single one of them seems rise to the level of a Steve-Jobs-in-the-biotech-field. I may be stunningly wrong on this (and it would be great fun if I was), but I think the probabilities are on my side, and on the side of it not happening.<p>But let's put aside the negativity and allow me to ask this question: Do we need a Steve Jobs of biotechnology to fulfill our expectations of medical advancement? I would guess, ""No, we don't. The good people toiling away at it right now are doing the best that can be done.""",1314379345

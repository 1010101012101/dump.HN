620255,comment,620091,620091,0,0,mtkd,,,"When I read the announcement this morning, it occurred to me that the reason I like AWS so much, and what separates them from other cloud offerings, is that they're doing stuff dev teams actually <i>want</i> and can <i>use</i> (not impenetrably complex tech we could use with some vendor consultancy). Import features like this are trivial for AWS to implement - but will be a step change for some customers.<p>Last generation vendors saying 'anyone can do what AWS are doing' is just crap. You can't buy the enthusiasm these guys have - and its not just one individual - if you talk to anyone from AWS (and they're often around nights/weekends to talk about stuff) they are in a different lane to the competition or vendors that should be the competition.",1242906963

I've been actively seeking out movies that are considered great, and just engaging my brain a bit more while I watch them. It has significantly increased my appreciation for many movies. It's also meant I've noticed more flaws, but it's made the experience of movie-watching so much more enjoyable and meaningful, and not just the time-killer it used to be.",1242906838

Stupidity is always more expensive.<p>The advantage of being poor is that you're detached from all that useless goods, property, stuff and even people. Then you can move. You can live where life is better - some warmer and cheaper place - maybe some buddhist countries, but not California, of course.<p>Take a look at the Indian brahmins, Tibetan or buddhist monks - they are very poor, as poor as possible, but they are happy and healthy because they does not trying to catch some advertised illusion or broadcasted style of life.<p>The rule is very simple - spend less than you got. It means to avoid what you can't afford. If you have only one bag with some absolutely necessary things you can live in almost every place with warm climate and peaceful people.",1242906780

620231,comment,619871,620099,0,0,abalashov,,,"That definitely is important.  MySQL has fairly turn-key and easy to understand replication and has had it for a while.<p>The Postgres crew hides behind the ""replication means different things to different people, so it would be quite presumptuous of us to build it!"" mantra.  It's quite annoying.<p>You can hack together crude replication in Postgres with Write-Ahead Log (WAL) shipping.  The config has some hooks in it to automate this process and bind to it.  But that doesn't allow you to do circular and/or master-master replication;  the receiving node has to continuously be in recovery mode.",1242905369
620230,comment,619871,619871,0,0,abalashov,,,"I would say the bulk of it is ease of administration, and, as others have mentioned, the ability to get it up and going and use quickly and simply while having a relatively opaque understanding of how an RDBM works underneath.<p>The other major difference is that MySQL AB put a lot more effort into having an extremely concise, easily navigable and user-friendly online documentation repository and associated support community.  Postgres has since made good strides in this area, but a lot of the documentation still reads like something intended for a fairly specialised audience that more or less knows what it wants;  the ignoramus-friendly parts of MySQL's documentation are a lot friendlier.<p>For this and its administrative simplicity, it just got to be known as the quick and easy database, and Postgres as the rocket science database.  (In reality, this is not true;  only Oracle is the rocket science database.  :-)<p>Also, MySQL was/is more appealing to corporate adopters since an Actual Company(TM) is Behind(R) the project.  Postgres has a commercial footprint in the form of various third-party consultancies like CommandPrompt, but the core of the project is a Debian-like anarchic band of hackers.  Nothing turns corporate America off more than a bunch of long-haired GNU hippies when it comes to big-ticket stuff, though they begrudgingly put up with it for Linux by now, Linux having become somewhat ""legitimised"" by the backing lent to it by IBM, the existence of Redhat, etc.",1242905221

That is also the reason why you don't enjoy the cheap stuff anymore - because you know that it's actually pretty bad. You can still drink it anyway, but you know it's not that good.<p>Suggesting that this is a bad thing is kind of suggesting that you don't think your tastes should evolve for the better throughout your life.

OEMs are willing to add signing keys of other players, but no one is interested in starting or running an operation that can sign F/OSS kernels with their key(after checking if that it's not malware).<p>Perhaps your few K$ might be better spent on such a nonprofit organization or division of the Linux foundation instead of throwing it at lawyers?

I had my sons well before I had a diagnosis, so I never wrestled with that question. I understand why people would not want to knowingly inflict such a thing on a loved one. But it easily becomes a slippery slope of ""people like you should not reproduce"".

In an early unit, he said that while it is interesting to go into how block ciphers work at the low level, he was going to omit that to get on to application of cryptography (I believe the official title of the course is ""Applied Cryptograph""). He emphasized that very very few people should be designing their own block ciphers or doing their own implementation of existing designs--almost everyone should be using a library implementation that has been well tested by experts.<p>I haven't taken the Stanford course (I'd like to--but my schedule has just not worked out to allow it yet), but I did go look at the slides from a few of the lectures there and it appeared that they go into more detail at the lower level on ciphers and hashes. I got the impression that the Stanford course and the Udacity course would compliment each other quite a bit.<p>As far as breaking someone's encryptor goes, there would be some mention of how things could be exploited if the thing you were attacking had certain flaws, usually as motivation to explain why things were done a certain way. E.g., if you don't have a random nonce here, someone will be able to do this and that will reveal something about your plaintext...that kind of thing.<p>For the specific example of trying to break someone's system that is using a block cipher in CTR mode to make a stream encryptor, I think a student finished the Udacity course and did well would know enough to:<p>(1) recognize that CTR mode is essentially using the block cipher to generate the key for a OTP, so flipping bits in the ciphertext flips the corresponding bits in the decrypted plaintext. Hence, if the attacker can find out through some means enough information about the structure of the messages so as to predict what is in the plaintext (account number to receive the deposit, for instance) he can make meaningful changes (assuming the system does not include some kind of check on the message integrity).<p>(2) recognize that if the key and counter sequence are ever reused the consequences are essentially the same as reusing a OTP key, and so focus on how the keys and counters are being initialized.",1340383495

I checked my email and noticed some purchases that I didn't make.<p>Initial Story Here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2866422<p>Long story short... my phone was temporarily lost, and in the mean time some purchases were made totaling $344.97.  I contacted Google who told me to contact Glu Mobile, who eventually told me they would not refund and to call my bank.  So I did, and my bank provided a temporary refund while they did their investigation.  After a month or 2, my bank contacted me and said they sided with me.<p>Now... this week I decided to buy an App from the Play Store.  Rundouble's app which is $1.60 (or around there) ... I try and purchase using a credit card and using my Wireless account.  Both won't let me.  So I log on to Google Wallet, which informs me they need to verify my account.  It asks me for a valid ID and some other document.<p>So against my better judgement I send them a copy of my drivers license and a copy of a credit card statement.  No big deal, it said it was just to verify my identity... I had a sneaking suspicion it was because of the chargebacks but thought it would be no big deal after I verified.<p>I got this email back a few days after:<p>--------------------------------------------\nHello,<p>Thank you for your email. I've researched your account and found that you've reported some of the charges in your Google Wallet account as fraudulent charges to your card issuing bank.

Things at least seem to organize themselves somewhat better than they 'ought' to, just on the basis of blind-chance evolution and natural selection.""</i><p>This is a common fallacy about evolution, and is explained beautifully by the anthropic principle, or in other words, the innate selection bias of our existence. We've self-selected for our own awareness of our circumstance and existence. Things are not organizing better than they ""ought"" to, they've just happened to organize to a sufficient point that we exist and perceive this process and say things about it like the above quote.<p>It is in the same way that someone who wins the lottery must think themselves exceedingly lucky that they, of all the millions of people participating, have won. They must think there is something mysterious about this, that things turned out somewhat better than they 'ought' to, just on the basis of blind chance.<p>Yet, what is the probability that some person, of the entire pool of people in the world, wins the lottery? One. It has necessarily happened by the nature of the lottery.<p>We as a species have won this lottery, by the mere nature of our sentience. We should not think it mysterious or unusual in any way. However, we are lucky in the sense that we are here; we are special in that we can perceive and understand. As long as we understand the fact that there is no ""should"" in evolution, this is a perfectly fine thought. it just happened, and on this planet, it produced something able to understand itself. As Carl Sagan said, ""We are a way for the cosmos to know itself."" Certainly there is much metaphysical and philosophical consequence to our existence, but scientifically and probabilistically speaking, it makes perfect sense.<p>Consequently, I believe it may be much more difficult to reach true AI than some have postulated.",1340381527

After Microsoft signs the ROM, the manufacturer _can't_ add a Red Hat or Ubuntu signature to the drivers for their hardware.<p>This means even if you convinced all the manufacturers to include, say, a Ubuntu key, you still couldn't verify option ROMs were secure. Only Microsoft's key would work for that - thus, Microsoft's key will be the only one installed by the manufacturers.<p>Your next solution - creating unstickered hardware - is not a solution. There are a few manufacturers offering a linux option (Dell, Lenovo), and a few who sell only linux hardware (system76.com). In a UEFI secure boot world, there would be < 1% of hardware that wasn't locked to Microsoft's key, while 99%+ would be locked. I know users are supposed to be able to access a BIOS screen to disable secure boot, but that makes installing Linux much more painful than installing Windows 8.

This thread is already very different as many have provided very interesting comments with valuable insight, including yourself.<p>I understand flow very well of course.  I can't say that I've ever used an editor that prevented me to enter that state.  I a not countering your statement, just providing my own experience.<p>Aside from programming I play the piano and classical guitar.  When I play music I am in flow.  That didn't happen until I had reasonable command of the instruments.  With vi (or any other tool) the same is required.  I wonder how much time it would take to go from vi neophyte to playing it like a piano?  That initial phase is painful if you have to get work done.<p>I also understand the value of playing a good instrument and using good tools.  And, while this value may not provide any hard quantifiable benefits to the project timeline it does provide benefits for the practitioner.  The project might still be six months late, but there will be more daily enjoyment, if you will, for the practitioner to remain on focus.  That could have value.  Whether or not there is a difference between someone who has never touched vi and a vi expert remains to be determined.  The vast majority of programmers don't use vi.<p>After reading your post and others on this thread my immediate reaction is that vi advocates might want to consider not characterizing vi as ""more efficient"" but rather highlight what it might do for a programmer.  I can't come up with the words right now, but ""more efficient"", in my book, calls for having quantifiable data at the project level (not the file level).<p>We all know that saving a few keystrokes here and there isn't going to bring a project to conclusion any sooner.  We had a project where we spent six months tracking down a bug that was due to a rounding error someone made in a calculation of lookup-table data used in a polyphase FIR filter module.  It was one of those things that was right in front of you but nobody could see it.  The project was late by an additional six months (it was already late) because of that bug.  That's the kind of thing I think about when I say that saving a few keystrokes on the editor doesn't matter in the context of a project.<p>I'll read the article you pointed out and see what else I can learn.<p>Thanks for your input and valuable insight.",1340381261

And I would recommend Colin Steele's description of his decisions as CTO, as he took the codebase away from PHP, first to Ruby and then to Clojure. The bit about the failures of Ruby are (in my opinion) the most interesting. Basically, it was too much work to get Ruby to go fast enough, and their problems were solved by using Agents in Clojure.<p>This I think is the key bit of the story:<p>""At this point, we were still focused on using Ruby/Eventmachine as a cornerstone of our technology stack.  But here we hit a snag. Yep.  Im gonna beat up Ruby, because it was a mistake.<p>...it doesnt scale.  ::ducks::<p>OK, thats not completely fair.  Ruby does scale.  But it doesnt scale well, or easily, and in benchmarking and stress testing, I was seeing that we were going to have a use a small truck load of resources at AWS, or spend a bunch of preciousssss developer time making it scale.  It was too expensive.  I wanted high user::machine density, and I didnt want to have my developers do handstands to get it.<p>Yeah, I couldve done lots of things.  I didnt have time to do that shit.  Not with a four person team.  Not with cash running out, and promises to keep, and no time to work for Ruby.  I needed something that would work for me.  This thing had to be FAST.  It had to drive hardware to the limit without driving us crazy.<p>The bottom line is that it was too much work to make Ruby go fast enough.<p>...A little background on our application might help.  Our job is to give prospective hotel bookers a view into what their options are.  At the time we were making the decision to migrate from Ruby to Clojure, the system was using so-called realtime rates and availability checks with hotel suppliers to get that information.  That meant that when a visitor conducted a search, we would spin up dozens of individual HTTP requests to hotel supplier sites to get rates and availability data at that very moment.  Wed parse the responses, collate them, and present them back to the UI in just a few seconds.<p>You might ask why we didnt cache that information, but suffice it to say there were significant business drivers for that decision.<p>Managing this concurrent (and long-running) IO was a major theme for us, and Ruby did so reasonably well using EventMachine.  However, we had to normalize the returned data into a single unified data model, and none of our partners had simple (or compact) XML representations of the data, so not only did we have IO issues, but CPU-bound processing issues as well.  The combination of the two made the EventMachine implementation suffer from less-then-stellar throughput, and because of Rubys green threads implementation and global interpreter lock, we had to run oodles of Ruby processes on each box to achieve reasonable throughput.<p>Perhaps just as importantly, the reactor patterns upside-down flow of control style of programming was (and is) a pain in the ass.  It was hard to read, hard to maintain, and generally obstreperous.<p>..I can already year you Ruby folks protesting Fibers! and so on. Heh.  Have fun storming that castle.<p>Clojure was a whole different story, and addressed these issues admirably, for all the reasons youll discover when you look into it further.

Cars, houses, whatever.  They'll have it and you won't.  Even if your startup turns a corner to provide lifestyle income, there are still issues.  This is a purely anecdotal example, but yesterday my wife and I went to a bank to talk about pre-qualifying for a mortgage loan, and apparently you need two years of self-employment history.<p>But here was the point that I think got lost in such a binary stated view of risk: right now it's easy to jump back on the totem pole.  If I really wanted to buy property that bad, I could get a job making well over my previous salary within weeks.  There are not a lot of entrepreneurial endeavors where that is true.<p>Consider something like opening a restaurant.  There is not just opportunity cost but <i>real investment cost</i> before you even get started.  And if you bomb, and statistically it's very likely you will, there is not nearly the the likelihood you can at least go back to where you started.  As another anecdotal example, my friend is a second year lawyer at a firm, one of the few people in his graduating class that got a nice corporate law job so that he actually has a chance to pay off his massive loans.  And he pretty much hates his life, but there's a huge chance that if he left to pursue one of his dreams, there would be no ""reset"" button.  There is no easy chance that if he doesn't succeed, he can just go back to being a highly compensated corporate lawyer within a few weeks.<p>So yes, there's obviously risk in starting your own startup.  There's always a cost to pursuing a dream, and not everyone wants to pay that cost.  The distinction is as a technology startup founder in this current environment, your cost is dramatically lower than anyone else's, and I think that's ultimately what I think the OP is trying to say.",1340381241

4147355,comment,4145558,4145943,2,0,chmike,,,"My use of modeling was indeed inappropriate. What I meant is the working principle of cortical neural networks. The artificial model would then be a kind of proof of concept.<p>Regarding you other point, it is a matter of research strategy. I think that the path trying understanding the working principle of real cortical neural network is the shortest path to AI. My impression is that the other path which is to play around with artificial neural networks is too hazardous.<p>We can make a parallel with learning to fly. We are in a similar situation regarding how the brain works and AI. Understanding how birds fly require a true research. People seems to simply focus on flapping while this is not the real working principle of flight.<p>I see there a strong analogy with artificial neural network. The most relevant properties of cortical neural networks are ignored.<p>With flight the proof condition of mastering it was obvious. With AI, it is less obvious. I would be glad to hear suggestions. Face recognition is the most difficult condition because this process is the end product of many prior processes like 3D perception and feature extractions. My current impression is that talk decoding would be a much better candidate. Siri shows the potential impact of such AI product. At least the turing test would be a direct match.",1340381229

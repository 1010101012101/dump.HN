And why is this wrong?</i><p>Because having individuals with limited resources independently pursuing their own goals doesn't necessarily maximize overall utility, or even any actual individual's utility. It's entirely possible to have a scenario where, say, nobody would individually pay for something to be researched, but everyone would be willing to chip in a small portion of the cost if everyone else did the same. Since it's difficult to ensure wide-scale cooperation, it doesn't happen and the result is that everyone is worse off.<p>I don't understand the mindset that sees a problem that, by elementary game theory, doesn't have an optimal outcome reachable by simple self-interest, and proposes that what we need is <i>more</i> self-interest.",1267376363

Why is overseas manufacturing cheap? Primarily, cheap labor. When does that cease to be an advantage? When labor is no longer a significant cost in manufacturing. We're getting there pretty quickly, and IMHO robotics has only recently (i.e., last two or three years) taken off, which should be able to continue the increased-productivity-per-human trend for a while yet.<p>Bad time to become an assembly line worker. Good time to get into robotics for manufacturing, probably.<p>I had a contract job in a tool & die facility a couple of years ago. It wasn't a factory, it was a ""build-to-order"" facility that had a wide variety of equipment in various places and they needed better tracking of their jobs and such. I didn't mention this to anyone, but I was struck by how much work was being done that could be automated in the near future. Tens of jobs dedicated solely to moving things around, which robots are going to be able to take over in the 5 year timeframe. Another tens of jobs that involve placing a metal part <i>just so</i> in a press and pushing two buttons (two so you have to use both hands). QA can't be replaced with robots entirely, but it could be helped. The bulk of the people on the floor were not doing things that required human judgment, even for human-class vision or human-class pathfinding. The future is basically now.",1267375892

It works for HIV (HAART) because despite the high mutation rate of HIV, it is exceedingly rare for the virus to sustain the ~3 different mutations required to confer resistance to 3 different drugs simultaneously.<p>I imagine that this will, in fact, be how we end up applying our targeted cancer therapies as well.<p>Let me put it this way: each base of the genome of a {cancer, bacterium, virus} has some chance of mutation at each replication step. If you target just one protein, then you may need as little as one mutation to confer resistance. In a normal human genome, you would expect this to happen to the nucleotide of interest once every hundred thousand cell divisions. Obviously a cancer has a higher error rate and millions of rapidly dividing cells, so this would occur quickly. If you target two proteins, you would expect both mutations to co-occur once every (100,000 x 100,000) cell divisions. If you target three proteins... Now you are getting somewhere.<p>Certainly it is not quite this simple. If variants with one mutation are more fit than those without it, then resistance to one drug in the cocktail will be selected for. But with HAART, we have seen that the multidrug approach is fairly - perhaps surprisingly - robust to that possibility.",1267375698

Moves are generally very simple (important so you can be effective without years of training). The problem with pretty much all other martial arts everyone is mentioning is that they have morphed to work ideally in a competitive environment. Sure, knowing just about any martial art will give you a huge advantage against someone who isn't skilled but there are alot of things people just don't train for with BJJ, Tae Kwon Do, etc.<p>For example, one of the first things we learned is defending yourself from various holds and chokes. The first move, after securing your throat or loosening their grip is generally to hit them in the balls. This is one example of something most martial arts won't teach you because that's generally ""against the rules"", however, in a self defense scenario, there are no rules (there are however laws that you may break so keep that in mind).<p>You really want to avoid going to the ground if at all possible. It just makes you more vulnerable if anyone else decides to jump in and you never know what you're rolling around on. Besides, what are you going to do, put someone in a submission until help arrives? A really effective way to break a hold is to grab their pinky and twist it in a direction it doesn't want to go. If they don't let go just move on to new fingers. Also, feel free to bite them. Hard. You can also pull hair, gouge eyes, fishhook, etc. It's great to know how to defend yourself on the ground, but you want to be on the ground as little as possible as it can be a dangerous place because your opponent is probably not playing under the same rules you are.<p>If you want more of a philosophy then it's probably not right for you.

And so is trying to clean up the environment so the species as a whole can survive.  It generally does not help to disregard the short-term survival needs of the people you are arguing with and leap straight to an assumption of ""malice"", which assumes they actively want to hurt people.  Willingness to disregard the welfare of others (or downplay long-term negative consequences out of fear of the short-term consequences) because one has a compelling survival issue is not the same thing as malice.

Great ROI on time invested and no need for hard training.<p>- Jiu Jitsu - excellent complementary MA for kung fu styles (like wing chun or wushu) since they are considered ""weak"" on the floor.<p>- Shorinji Kempo - probably the most balanced MA out of them all I've seen (I'll explain later)<p>- Kenjutsu - if you'd like to train with the sword :)<p>What you have to realize though is that you're not in it to be a ninja or whatever, you'll not fight anyone on the streets flying all over and shooting power orbs (right?), so you have to ask yourself what you'd like to train for.<p>As a fellow that sits around computers for long times I recommend one of these:<p>a)
- Qigong - this is the base for everything, you will feel health benefits from it and geenrally feel more power flowing through you. If you can pick only one do this. Wing Chun is 99% accompanied with Qigong (also sometimes called Chi gung, kung) practice.<p>you can accompany Qigong with either Wing Chun (and Jiu Jitsu) if you want to train to be a competent defensive fighter or you can substitute Wing Chun with Tai Chi (Chuan) which is basically a battle version of Qigong so you can train only Tai Chi.<p>or b)<p>- train Shorinji Kempo and accompany it with Qigong<p>I also hear rather good things about Aikido and Hapkido, but I have no exposure to them.",1267373433

The idea of a subscription is really nice, as it provides a guaranteed base income per customer. However, the total value of a customer is dependent on the length of time they remain a customer (I know, obvious).<p>For this product, the subscription payment is a credit towards the use of the service. Commonly (such as in the cellphone subscription model), these credits are ""use it or lose it"" on a periodic basis. From a business perspective, I understand how the subscription designer would like to be able to ""capture"" the revenue as quickly as possible and have a handle on the profit level per customer. Also, the customer often has to ""hit a hole in one"" to maximize their value from the subscription pricing.<p>However, another model is possible - where the customer's unused credit accrues over each subscription period (this is the ""rollover minutes"" thing on steroids). This will result with the customer seeing that they have, say, $150 in ""potential value"" associated with the subscription - an amount many times more than the subscription amount, and something they will lose if they decide to cancel the service.<p>I'm interested in research into how people react to these kinds of situations, and whether there is a ""breaking point"" at which the customer decides that the potential value has become a liability rather than a positive thing.<p>NB: I don't see the pricing model as being a substitute for a great product, but everything matters.",1267373403

658377,comment,658091,658091,0,0,tumult,,,"This sounds cool, but I think I will just make a jumble if I try to actually use it. What I like most about closures in most languages is how quickly it lets you work. In C, I don't want to work quickly. I need to be methodical and pay close attention to detail -- this usually means I'm going to keep track of what I'm doing both in my head, in notes I'm taking, and in the actual C code. Passing pointers along with the callbacks (for example) isn't such a big deal when I'm already doing all of this extra work.<p>I mean, I'm writing C in the first place since I'm doing something low-level, something that needs careful optimization, implementing some kind of base system for something else, etc. Otherwise I'd just use a higher level language.<p>In the context of Obj-C it makes more sense, though, since you're already writing C while working with a higher-level language, too. You use obj-c objects if you need refcounting or GC at the moment; I can definitely see the usefulness of having closures in C. I know lots of people will probably use it just fine, but for me, I think I would just make a hash of my own code.<p>Or maybe when I give it a shot it'll work out fine. Ok done with rant :)",1245073918

That's my point: from simple people complex systems form and operate. To say that people are not smart enough to run their own affairs is quite interesting. I'm not sure how to reply to that.<p>But switching to the technology side, with the internet we already have some examples of voting and filtering in action. For instance, there are probably a thousand bad, emotional blog entries for each one that gets upvoted on HN. It's just a matter of appropriate filtering and selection criteria.<p>Let's suppose instead of voting items up or down we categorize them by how they emotionally affect the reader. Over time, the system could provide an appropriate mix of interesting, insightful, and sometimes maddening material for me to consume. My ""tolerance level"" would be determined by how emotionally I responded to certain stimulus. The system would keep things emotional, but not so much as to not have a cohesive discussion.<p>That's a broad outline of one solution. There are others.",1245073459

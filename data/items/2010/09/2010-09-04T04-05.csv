Please note, I am not trying to respond to any of the other aspects or questions you asked -- this ""simple"" response became way too long as it is :-)<p>PREPARE AHEAD OF TIME:
A. Learn to communicate.  A lot of life is dealing with miscommunication.  It seems scientists as a group have the same issue with miscommunication that software developers generally have.  This is very important where the science is critical for impacting public policy decisions.  Especially, learn to listen, so that the metaphors and analogies that are guiding the incorrect thinking can be ascertained.<p>B. Expect that as soon as you are using science to advocate for public policy changes scientists <i>will</i> have opposition.  Actually, the science part isn't the prereq, it is the ""advocate for public policy changes"".  Lots of groups who advocate for public policy changes get villianized.  It sucks, but it should not come as surprise to anyone who enters into that arena.  If you (generic) want to be left alone, keep your head low.  If you (generic) want to stand up for something -- you <i>will</i> be opposed.<p>REACT:
C. Educate.  In my opinion, the scientist is supposed to educate people in a simple a terms as possible.  I believe scientists used to view this as part of their duty and I believe it has been something that has been generally lost (fwiw I have a 3 volume set of articles that great scientists such as Einstein and Bohr wrote for lay people that span over two centuries... often the articles were published in newspapers.. I have loaned it out, otherwise, I'd list the set for those interested).  To educate the lay people, write articles for news papers or online venues. Engage critics with openness, because in doing so professionalism is shown and confidence is built up.<p>D. Be respectful.  Don't refer to people who disagree as deniers or anti-science or ignorant.  Give them the benefit of the doubt.  Figure out the faulty metaphors they are employing and reveal them.  At the worst, agree to disagree.  I have recently encountered a scientist doing exactly this, and have been very impressed with him (and I expect I disagree with him on some fundamental beliefs), but I have contacted him to encourage him in what he is doing, and even sought his feedback on some of my own interests.. because I can trust him to be methodical AND respectful.  Respect opens up the possibility for long term dialogue.  Also, keep in mind that your audience isn't <i>only</i> the person asking questions or postulating absurd theories.  It includes the people who are undecided watching the debate (or reading the news article, etc..) as well as the minority / subset of the opposing view who are willing to listen.<p>FOLLOW UP:
E.  Make a point of gathering objections, alternative theories etc, and having the data that refutes them readily and publicly available.  This is just a tactical confidence building move.<p>SUMMARY:
Please note, I'm not encouraging necessarily that a single person do all these things.  Happily scientists do not work alone, are part of associations, etc.. and collectively they can do these steps and maintain/gain/improve a good footing with the public.  And doing so in a respectful way will gain more good will (even from people who disagree) than you might imagine.",1283576050

1662051,comment,1661861,1661861,0,0,chipsy,,,"I let myself get scared a little, as I should with any good peak oil story, and then went looking for an Achilles' Heel.<p>""Some might also wonder why a shortage of oil should automatically trigger a collapse. It turns out that, in an industrialized economy, a drop in oil consumption precipitates a proportional drop in overall economic activity. Oil is the feedstock used to make the vast majority of transportation fuels -- which are used to move products and deliver services throughout the economy. In the US in particular, there is a very strong correlation between GDP and motor vehicle miles traveled. Thus, the US economy can be said to run on oil, in a rather direct and immediate way: less oil implies a smaller economy. At what point does the economy shrink so much that it can no longer meet its own maintenance requirements? In order to continue functioning, all sorts of infrastructure, plant and equipment must be maintained and replaced in a timely manner, or it stops functioning. Once that point is reached, economic activity becomes constrained not just by the availability of transportation fuels, but also by the availability of serviceable equipment. At some point the economy shrinks so much as to invalidate the financial assumptions on which it is based, making it impossible to continue importing oil on credit. Once that point is reached, the amount of transportation fuels available is no longer limited just by the availability of oil, but also constrained by the inability to finance oil imports.""<p>This is the part which attempts to convince the reader that a simple recession/stagnation cannot occur.<p>Unfortunately, it vastly underestimates our resourcefulness and runs on the fallacy of the USA only ever being capable of transportation with petroleum, or of a collapse so swift and sudden(from full consumption to zero in a matter of months; an unlikely event, between price hikes, austerity measures, the application of strategic reserves, opening of existing private stocks, etc.) that no response can be made. If it ever becomes too costly to run petroleum-based freighters, we can still revive coal and sail technology. That alone will ensure the survival of ocean-bound transportation(and hence a lot of import-export dependencies). Overland, goods in the USA are transported through the most cost-effective freight system in the world; trucks are ""last mile"" haulers in most situations. Our existing rail and electric systems can revert to coal for some time to come, although nobody likes the ecological costs involved in coal. And this even leaves open the possibility of refrigerated transit, just not necessarily at present-day schedules.<p>So the remaining energy problems, as I see them, are in petro-agriculture dependency and infrastructure(primarily in housing stock). Difficult? Yes. Impossible? No. People will die as a result of pretty much any peak oil scenario. A full collapse, though, requires both an overnight cratering of production, and an awful lot of faith in people to do exactly the wrong things.",1283575761

She had to disappear for a month, all while doing one or two mandated tasks from Loneshark Games to give some clues to the people hunting her and three other ""runners"" down. With all the photos and videos the runners had taken during the course of the hunt, it would have made for a really fascinating read, but the writer left before the feature was finished, and the whole thing was boiled down to a rather lame blog post instead.<p><a href=""http://cs.condenastdigital.com/cs/wordpress/repomen/?p=2124"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.condenastdigital.com/cs/wordpress/repomen/?p=2124</a><p>I've bugged her to write down her experience in some form, she traveled all over the country on a limited budget, and we pulled some pretty smooth tricks on the people chasing her (by the time one guy figured out I was a mole, none of the other hunters trusted him, and thought HE was the one leaking info to the runners), but she never got around to that.<p>Alex managed to elude people quite well, using me and one other friend as her sole contacts during the ordeal. I think we did a smashing job eluding everyone, and it was a really fascinating experience, even just from my position as the guy gathering and relaying intelligence and information. The other guy who beat the hunters was ex-Army, said we'd do well in the CIA, heh.<p>Anyhow, I guess what I'm really posting about is that even when you're forced to reveal aspects of your whereabouts online, it's not that hard to disappear. The hard part is not going crazy during the process. At first you're too paranoid, but if you get too comfortable, you'll start to give away clues to your past, and that will ultimately be your undoing. ""Never look back"" is so much harder than most people realize, especially in the long term.<p>I would love to believe that in the future, people are given more leeway for the way they behaved in their youth, given the way the internet never forgets. Everyone makes mistakes, but so many people are documenting each other now, things like that aren't forgotten the way they used to be.<p>The idea of completely shedding an old identity is pretty absurd, a short-term workaround at best.",1283575484

For Ping to succeed they're going to have to convince users that their platform is dedicated to social music, not enhancing the itunes purchasing experience. So unless iTunes gets every music listener in the world, or darn close to everyone, to use iTunes instead of however they currently listen to music, then their social functionality is going to always be less useful than a platform independent service. A social network gains value with more users (in general), so if iTunes is restricting the flow of potential users it's just going to hurt them.<p>iTunes could satisfy the iTunes user market. But unless clusters of friends all use iTunes, a decentralized service will be more useful.

You suggest elsewhere that ""done""ness is a 100% thing. If Perl5 keeps changing, and it was 100% done in 1994 ... something is really inconsistent with the universe.<p>chromatic's pedantry is a symptom of people like us ignoring the fact that even a language like TeX will only be done when the author decides it's done (Knuth's death for example). That and he's a grumpy-butt sometimes. Perl6 is a fully-functional language in that you can write useful (for some value of useful) scripts in it. The specification is undergoing radical changes, but then as I've pointed out the Perl5 specification is undergoing changes that some consider ""radical"" (if you doubt this, read threads on perl5-porters sometime ... look up the debate(s) about the ""feature"" pragma).<p>Valid complaints about Rakudo being an unfinished implementation of Perl6 are better centered around things like it doesn't pass 100% of the Spec tests yet. The Rakudo developers will (I'm pretty sure) own up to this, and point to the fact that they're working hard on it and that patches are welcome. That doesn't mean that Rakudo * was in some way ""Pre Release"". I don't recall anybody using the term ""Pre"" when talking about the Rakudo * release. The terms I remember are ""early"", ""useful"", ""useable"",""for developers"". If we as non-members of the Perl6 community go about continuing to imply that Perl6 is somehow less than released in a way for developers to generate useful and usable applications, we're gonna have the grumpier members of the Perl6 community call us on it.<p>It looks to me like you have a unique opportunity to contribute most effectively to Perl6 moving from being what you consider pre-Released to Released. You can submit a doc patch to change the tense in the Perl6 documentation.",1283573229

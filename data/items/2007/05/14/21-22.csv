22030,comment,21907,21994,0,0,sudden5,,,"thanks for the call out and link : )<p>overhear.us is extremely experimental at this point and could change dramatically. we spent 6 weeks and made it on a whim and it has already proved useful as a feedback device internal to YC.   <p>there remain a lot of obvious improvements to be made product, but it is an experiment.  right now we are eyeing it and seeing how people are using it, and how we can get them to use it better.<p>i'd love to talk more about it, but i have a feeling i'm already being pulled in to an online war by responding to this comment.

22028,comment,21990,21990,0,0,euccastro,,,"I don't want to sound negative, but first impression is pathetic. A bunch of suits with no apparent startup experience , plus a techie that gave up after trying once, blatantly parasitizing on the YCombinator brand. And what with this Stephan Zeinler's Bono picture? Screams phony.<p>Don't judge a book by its cover and all that, but still.<p>[Edit: To be fair, I hadn't read the disclaimer: ""This site is inspired by, but not affiliated with YCombinator."" I still think they could use some personality.]\n",1179179754
22027,comment,21819,21855,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"BitGeek has a few valid points, but they're hidden amongst so much vague muck, that I'm not sure it's wise to try to follow it as advice.<p>So, the primary bit worth really noting:<p>""Build your think""  (I'll assume ""think"" was intended as ""thing"".)<p>This is the ""build something people want"" of the YC model.  There's nothing better you can do if you want funding than to build something people want.  It's possible to get funding for things people don't want, but much harder, and why bother?  Get to the point where you're sure people want it, before trying to get big funding (big being anything over $50k).  You'll be in a stronger position in negotiations, and you'll be able to choose from good investors.<p>""network with your peers""<p>This is the weekly dinners part of the YC model, and I believe it was more useful to us than all of the other great stuff that YC brought to us (and I frequently say so).  If there were a ""technical startup founders club"" that existed in some startup hub, and had some kind of barrier to entry akin to the YC application process, I believe it would produce nearly as many good businesses as Y Combinator.  You need the barrier to entry, because business idiots flock to events that have lots of hackers looking to start businesses, hoping to find someone to implement their killer idea.  They end up making it a useless business card exchange--I noticed this at quite a few of the more open YC events and meetup type things around YC--hackers are shy, and so the business idiots end up doing all the talking, and the hackers just kind of stand around being assaulted by the loud jackasses with killer ideas.  Without the seriously smart hackers and designers-only rule, there's no value.  Even without the money or Paul Graham, this kind of weekly event would product great results.<p>""Slashdot is read by an older (more experienced) crowd than news.yc. It would be a good idea to understand some of where they are coming from-- after all they were around during the last boom when the average YC foundre was not yet a teen!""<p>On this bit, well, I'm kind of stunned as how much the trolls have taken over Slashdot in the past couple of years.  I've been a slashdot reader since it was chips and dips (yeah, I'm old), and it was once a place where people starting companies would get a warm reception and reasonably good advice.  The remaining old-timers seem to be just bitter about failed ventures during and in the aftermath of the boom...that's not wisdom.  Take note that I've founded a Y Combinator company, and I'm also one of those Slashdot old-timers of which you speak (hopefully, having the experience needed to make rational judgment calls on these issues), and I found little but trolling on that thread, which is was I felt compelled to respond.\n",1179179710

22024,comment,21907,22019,0,0,ashu,,,"Very well said. That site is a lot of fun to use... People who think they are prophetic regarding consumer internet ideas are kidding themselves. The only way to know whether an idea will work or not is to just go ahead and TRY IT. And Paul/Evan have already done this twice in such a small amount of time. That speed and taste for great execution is what YC's bet is. ",1179179340

I know for certain though that we will keep trying until we are (which may be never). My co-founder is my cousin, so he isnt exactly going away :) He's keeps my fire lit and I do the same for him.<p>My biggest fear is not being able to move as fast as if we were in the YC program. I think YC is a gentle push to release as soon as possible, which is important. I suspect many of the early-stage teams who are rejected do not actually execute their idea and release. (Hence the apparent absence of successful ""rejected"" groups maybe?)",1179178204

22019,comment,21907,21994,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Overhear.us is an example of YC funding smart people, rather than any particular idea.  Paul and Evan are smart and really good at what they do (development and design, respectively).<p>I agree that they may not have hit on the right idea for their skills yet (overhear.us is fun as hell to use and eats time like nothing else I've ever used, but it doesn't seem to be getting traction, so far), but I have no doubt they will build something great.  They may end up going back to the drawing board (maybe even a few times) before doing it...but you'll hear about them again.  They're still young...plenty of time to make a few mistakes before hitting on something great.<p>YC is a very early stage investor.  They bet on people more than ideas.  I believe betting on Paul and Evan was a well-placed bet, even if Socialmoth and Overhear.us never explode into popularity.",1179177719

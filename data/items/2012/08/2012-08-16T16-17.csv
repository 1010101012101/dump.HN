This is a quick read that summarizes part of the problem:<p><a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4407fb24-edc4-11e0-a9a9-00144feab49a.html#axzz23j9nepat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4407fb24-edc4-11e0-a9a9-00144...</a><p>2)  How do you choose the correct ETF.  How do you choose between emerging markets nd US, etc.  Picking a broad market ETF is probably safest, but there is even a variety of those with different features.<p>3)  Tracking Error can cause ETFs to outperform or underperform by huge amounts on occasion.  This article refers to Vanguards telecommunications services ETF which underperformed by 5.7%!  <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/09/etf-tracking-errors.asp#axzz23jCeye1G"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/09/...</a><p>4)  Compared with no load funds, ETFs can be expensive due to trading fees.

Working with that interpretation, my point was that maybe Germany didn't get better, but the US got worse which by default makes Germany look better. I then implied that using Berlin as the capital of the free doesn't work, since there are more free places even in the EU.

Admittedly, the competition in these arenas is indeed very stiff, and they have invested a lot of money in efficient production.

4392213,comment,4387407,4389032,1,0,beagle3,,,"> good for time-series data, but I (personally) think that it shouldn't be a first-class part of a relational query language;<p>First of all, there's some tautology here - a ""relational database"" (and similarly, relational calculus, relational algebra, etc), <i>BY DEFINITION</i> deal with sets of tuples (""relations"") which are (again, by definition) unordered. So let's just ignore the word ""relational"" in this discussion.<p>> I think most databases do support the ROW_NUMBER() function now though.<p>Many do. But do compare (sql 2005):<p><pre><code>    SELECT * FROM
    ( SELECT
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sort_key ASC) AS ROW_NUMBER,
        COLUMNS
      FROM tablename
    ) foo
    WHERE ROW_NUMBER <= 10
</code></pre>
To (kdb+ / q):<p><pre><code>    select from tablename orderby asc sort_key where i<10;
</code></pre>
And usefulness of order goes why beyond time-series data (and sorting): let's say you have a tiered pricing scheme for widgets you sell:<p><pre><code>    order_size | per_widget_cost
    ----------------------------
    1-9        | $2
    10-49      | $1.9
    50-199     | $1.8
</code></pre>
Without embracing order, you:<p>a) duplicate the range data (have a ""from-count"", ""to-count"" fields for each record, risking that you might have holes or overlaps)<p>b) not duplicate data, but have crazy subselects (among all with count > from_count, select the one with maximum to_count) or stuff like that.<p>When you actually have order, you have operator that embrace that order - e.g. kdb+/q's ""bin"" which finds the ""bin"" (as in ""bucket"", not as in binray) something fits in:<p><pre><code>    select unit_price[from_count bin order_count] from table
</code></pre>
There are many other use cases involving running sums (e.g, you have a table of weights and priority; select the list of highest priority items whose weight sums to 100lbs or less).<p>Order is really really missing in SQL, but it's one of those things people are not aware of because they've never used anything that does support it properly.<p>nested columns just means what it sounds like: that you can put anything in a cell (including lists, tables, lists of tables, lists of lists of lists of tables). Many one-to-many relationships in sql that need additional tables can just be done within the same table in kdb+/q<p>regarding Common Table Expressions - I wasn't aware of them, they do help a lot. The syntax is horrible, but I guess they do work...<p>edit: more info on kdb+/q can be found in <a href=""http://kx.com/q/d/kdb+1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kx.com/q/d/kdb+1.htm</a> - you have to get to section 8 before they start discussing the query language, but it's short and to the point.

I'm wondering if someone can clear up some points:<p>1. Apparently there is a two-stage interview process in Sweden with criminal investigations. A first interview, which Assange has done, and a second that is equivalent to being charged. Is this true?<p>2. It has been argued that Swedish authorities have done interviews in embassies and other countries in other cases but have refused to do so here. In those other cases, are they first or second interviews (assuming (1) is correct)?<p>3. Has the US formally charged, indicated they would charge, sought extradition or otherwise indicated they would seek extradition of Assange or is it merely assumed?<p>4. Is there any substantive difference in extradition proceedings from the UK or Sweden? The US could seek extradition from the UK. It is argued by Assange's defenders that it is easier from Sweden and a UK judge may well throw out the request as being politically motivated whereas extradition from Sweden, it is argued, can be done politically rather than through the courts. How true is this?<p>5. Sweden has refused to not extradite Assange, should he return, to the US. How normal is this? Can Sweden legally do this? I know EU countries have, in the past, as a condition of extradition required the US to guarantee that the death penalty won't be sought or applied. I assume in those cases that is a real issue so it seems like there is some room for movement when it comes to extradition;<p>6. What is the status of Assange's legal proceedings against extradition to Sweden? The High Court has ruled I believe so the only recourse now is the European Court of Human Rights? Is that still ongoing? Can it make a binding ruling against extradition that the UK must abide by?<p>7. When it comes to criminal charges in any country I'm familiar with there are two things: how the law is written and how it is applied. Many things are illegal that the authorities don't actively pursue. Partially this is simply convention, partially its policing and partially (IMHO) it's holding things in reserve, meaning if you really want to get someone you have something. Is this also the case for Sweden? Given the facts as (publicly) known regarding the rape allegations, how normal is it to seek criminal charges in this case?<p>8. With regards to political asylum. How normal is it for a country to offer political asylum to someone in another country who is a citizen of a third country resisting extradition to a fourth? Hell, you can probably add ""because of fears of being extradited to a fifth""!<p>Assange is an Australian citizen. As an Australian citizen myself I'm disappointed but not at all surprised in the silence of the Australian government on this issue and the apparent acquiescence to US demands. It's often pointed out that citizenship is not only a privilege but a responsibility. The government likewise has a responsibility to defend the interests of its citizens and I see that sadly lacking here.",1345135224

The ideas is that Wall Street can efficiently price financials (except in speculative bubbles, but if can't judge if a stock is in a bubble then don't buy it!) but doesn't have the computer nerd expertise to judge the long-term viability of a product line or engineering culture. Along similar lines, I made a tidy profit in 2008 on banks because I knew a few people at these banks and knew which ones worked and which ones were dysfunctional at a high level--a sort of perfectly legal ""insider"" information.

I started interviewing again, got interviews, passed all coding tests, was complimented in some of them. And I was shot down in each. They called me for face to face interviews and in some of them I got a strong feeling that they were only trying to find a reason to reject me. You might ask, ""but if they called you they must have been interested in you?"" Well, maybe. It's human nature, we are highly irrational creatures who think are rational. I could solve problems, but my CV didn't look good and I'm not good in face to face interview and I can tell they definitely are in the mindset of shooting you down when you show the tiniest mistake, slip or lack of knowledge (my best guess for this behaviour is that most candidates suck and they expect you to suck). By the way, nobody payed any interest in the books I had read in between and little interest in my hobby projects.<p>I was quite sad and disappointed, not for being unemployed or rejected, no.

They did not allege rape.<p>- The initial prosecutor dropped their investigation as not meeting criteria that would merit its continuance.<p>- Later, a second prosecutor -- in a different district and with no prior involvement -- picked the case up and pursued it further.  Why?<p>- Assange stayed in Sweden upwards of a month and did participate in questioning.  He left after the case was supposedly dropped and he was told, in response to his question, that he was free to travel abroad.<p>- Subsequent to his travel to England, Swedish authorities reopened the case and sought him for further questioning.<p>- Assange was willing to participate in further questioning, but upon advice of his attorneys declined to return to Sweden.  Swedish law permits questioning to procede under such circumstances.<p>- Up to this point, Assange was not charged with any crime.  He was simply ""wanted for further questioning"".  If anything, the Swedish prosecutors seemed to be going out of their way to <i>avoid</i> charging him with any crime -- perhaps seeking to avoid causing any ""warning"", either informally or in some legal sense.<p>- When Assange refused to return, Sweden finally issued an Interpol Red Notice.  Red Notices are the highest level of Interpol ""flag"".  They are very rarely used.  This was issued for someone wanted for questioning regarding alleged rape -- an allegation apparently made by a <i>prosecutor</i> but not by the actual alleged victims.<p>- Some fairly convincing, if circumstantial, evidence has been identified and reported that the U.S. has indeed convened a grand jury.  This includes someone having identified the specific grand jury identification number.  Decomposition of said number (it's constructed using various aspects of the grand jury timing and topic) shows that the grand jury is investigating a topic pertaining the Espionage Act.<p>- Apparently (I've seen less on this), one of the women involved has refused to sign her initial statements or to participate further in the Swedish investigation.  The other woman has left Sweden.  Now, granted, publicity and ""blowback"" from Assange supporters might well be a cause for this.  But we don't have any reports of this being the case nor of specific events that might show such activity.  On the other hand, it does not present a picture of two victims of rape seeking justice (in Sweden, where women's rights are much more supported than in many countries).<p>--<p>I don't mean to minimize the very real crime and trauma of rape.  But upon digging into the specific details and timeline of this situation, it really starts to stink.<p>P.S.  I'm reading some of the more specific, step by step descriptions of the sexual activity allegedly involved.  If Assange did indeed force intercourse without the use of a condom, then I'm all for him being charged.  Although this still seems at odds with the publicly observed personal interactions that continued for days after the alleged events.<p>Even if this were to be the case, it does not mean that the U.S. is not leaving no stone unturned in its effort to get its hands on Assange.  And, if nothing else, the treatment of Manning -- now formally classified as torture by the U.N. -- seems to provide clear indication that extradition to the U.S. might well result in the violation of Assange's rights.<p>This is what happens when a government stoops to criminal activity.  It no longer has any credence, even were its case to be legitimate.<p>And finally, once again, I'll ask:  Where are the reprimands and punishments for those responsible who mis-designed and mis-managed such a fucked up intelligence information system?  And for those whose criminal activities were identified by the leaked information.<p>U.S.A. -- land of hypocrisy.",1345132895

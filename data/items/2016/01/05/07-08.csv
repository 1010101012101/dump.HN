So yes, I havent been using Python 3 much - there has been no reason to.<p>the point I&#x27;m trying to make is how to get everyone on the same page.

Rather than buying just a factory with their available capital they used it to fund the expansion of what are known as <i>chaebols</i>, Korean firms involved in a wide range of enterprises.

10841869,comment,10836236,10841185,0,0,lewisl9029,,,"Unfortunately, the declarative style of programming might not be exactly what you seem to think it is. Take a look at the Wikipedia page for declarative programming: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming</a><p>&quot;Although pure functional languages are non-imperative, they often provide a facility for describing the effect of a function as a series of steps.&quot;<p>&quot;While functional languages typically do appear to specify &quot;how&quot;, a compiler for a purely functional programming language is free to extensively rewrite the operational behavior of a function, so long as the same result is returned for the same inputs. This can be used to, for example, make a function compute its result in parallel, or to perform substantial optimizations (such as deforestation) that a compiler may not be able to safely apply to a language with side effects.&quot;<p>Pure functional mappings is one of the textbook examples of declarative programming. It might look like you&#x27;re specifying steps to get some result in the code, but that&#x27;s the wrong conceptual model. You&#x27;re actually specifying the <i>resulting data</i> you want <i>as</i> a set of functional transformations on top of some initial data. Exactly how the program arrives at that resulting data from the initial data (recursion/loops/inlining/whatever else) is up to the language runtime/compiler, and not something that functional programmers needs to worry about, thus why it&#x27;s declarative and not imperative.<p>React and Angular&#x27;s approaches to templating are both declarative. React&#x27;s approach simply offers more expressive power by allowing the whole set of functional transformations in the JS language rather than some artificially limited subset. React&#x27;s approach also allows for this declarative approach to extend to the entire application architecture by modeling entire apps as pure functional mappings between state and UI.<p>UPDATE:<p>> When one uses an if else-if else, while, switch, or other similar control flow statements, one departs from describing, to imparting the details of the implementation. The only part declarative about JSX is the conversion of certain code into valid text/attribute values/etc. into the HTML, which I&#x27;d hope is a minimum requirement of a useful templating language.<p>This hints to a bit of a misunderstanding of what exactly JSX is. Control flow statements are <i>not</i> valid JSX code precisely because JSX is a purely declarative description of UI.

What incentive would landlords have to willfully cut into their profit margins vs. passing the increases on to the renters?<p>They&#x27;re not doing it willfully. They&#x27;re doing it because they have no choice. Let&#x27;s say the current average rent in Seattle is $1,500/month. Why $1,500, and not $2,000/month? Why are the landlords willfully cutting into their profit margins by not increasing rent? We both know the answer: because the current price is based on what the market can bear; in other words, it&#x27;s based on the relationship between supply and demand. They can&#x27;t arbitrarily decide to raise rents without risking losing tenants and having units go unoccupied.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say the property tax increases a bit. Will that be passed onto the tenants? Well, can the market bear it? If no, then it won&#x27;t be passed on. If yes, then why wasn&#x27;t the rent increased before?<p>Like I said before, it&#x27;s different in low cost of living areas. There, the profit margin on top of the costs is relatively small. The rents in that case aren&#x27;t really based on demand, because supply in those areas tends to be very flexible, you can always make more housing to match demand. For a property tax increase in those areas, the costs will be passed onto the renters, because the primary determinant of rental prices is cost.",1451978529

For me the conclusion looking at it is straightforward, countries that have high inequality are overwhelmingly shitholes, sorry to say, and high innovation rates per capita are not coming out of them. On the other hand countries that have low inequality seem to me to be the ones that on average have high rates of innovation per capita.<p>At worst the data is inconclusive and low/high inequality doesn&#x27;t have an effect on innovation (which means we can go ahead and be socialist if we want, it won&#x27;t hurt!) -- and at best it indicates that low inequality and a healthy middle class generally <i></i>favors<i></i> innovation (which means we should be socialist to stimulate progress!). Anyone disagrees with this?<p>For the idea that &quot;free capital floating around looking for high risk isn&#x27;t available in low inequality countries&quot; .... I would say, well give incentives to high-risk investors, and/or spread the risk more. This is what the state/government is good at, spreading risk on lot of people, taking on risky business, big challenges, borrowing money, etc. As you pointed out, there is already such an incentive in place in the US. Btw, isn&#x27;t that technically speaking a form of &quot;socialism&quot; and &quot;government interventionism&quot;? That&#x27;s good, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with doing that if it works. I&#x27;m not sure this is a big problem, worth voting neo con for. I think socialism might even deal well with that problem. I&#x27;m not sure socialist countries have problems with investing in startups. More data welcome.<p>The idea with socialism and interventionism is to tweak the current system, capitalism, to make it work better. Capitalism was already in the first place an idea to make everyone&#x27;s life better through cheaper products. It&#x27;s pretty clear that there is an evolution of political systems throughout history and as someone has pointed out earlier in the comments, taxation in the 20th century was an improvement on capitalism that helped create more wealth for everyone, while keeping innovation going at an increased rate, and avoided revolts and revolutions that were common in previous centuries at the same time.<p>An interesting metaphor: I think it&#x27;s a good metaphor to say that exponential tech progress is the result of the interaction between 1) smart people that invent and discover, 2) investors excited by profit 3) middle class buyers ... If this is correct, increasing any of these 3 things will improve the output, i.e. more innovation.<p>According to neo cons, the bottleneck to improve in priority is 2) investors excited by profit. Which is important indeed, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the bottleneck currently. It might be the least urgent of the three. It might be that the 3) middle class and 1) more smart scientists and engineers are more the bottlenecks currently.<p>It&#x27;s possible also that no matter what we do at this point the exponential curve will continue unaffected. What controls that curve exactly? One thing Ray Kurzweil notes about all the exponential tech trends is that they are very steady, continue unaffected during periods of war or peace, growth or recession. So could it be that those 3 &quot;ingredients&quot; that generate &quot;tech progress&quot; don&#x27;t matter that much? I.e. that we already have enough of the 3 and there is no bottleneck? Kurzweil states that more existing technology leads to more possible combinations, thus more possible innovations (which I think is in rough terms the &quot;law of accelerating returns&quot; if I&#x27;m not mistaken). It&#x27;s possible that law alone is sufficient to generate the exponential curve, and that we are not even near a bottleneck on any of the three factors mentioned.<p>So in the end, it might be that there is a bottleneck in one or more of the 3 ingredients, or that we are not even close to a bottleneck on any of those 3 ingredients, and in that case, we do what we want. We can be socialist or not, and the tech trend might still continue unabated.<p>In any case, I think 1) more engineers and 2) more middle class are the things we should focus on, if there&#x27;s a bottleneck. That&#x27;s my impression. I think it&#x27;s our best bet. Happy to hear other opinions.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear other people talk about exponential tech progress and see if they believe there more than 3 ingredients and how they think it can be accelerated more besides just the law of accelerating returns.<p>More data about tech progress would be great, to see if in some cases something can slow it down, or accelerate it more (besides just a paradigm shift).",1451977845

So the whole problem cannot happen in Canada (nor in the U.K.).<p>I&#x27;m not saying everything&#x27;s roses and perfection in commie-land...

When I was living in California, and had a medical incident, I got VERY good treatment... for which my employer&#x27;s insurance company paid a HILARIOUS amount of money, and presumably charged my employer commensurate premiums.

It's clear that both these apps were built carefully so that your average PC user wouldn't get confused. Problem is, most Apple users are not what you'd call average.<p>The aggressive ""switch"" campaign is fairly new, Apple-wise. iTunes was available for Mac OS 9 and Finder was designed so that <i>average Mac users</i> would not be confused -- remember, it was a battle to get people to ditch Classic mode...In any case, neither have much of anything to do with Windows.<p>I miss window shading...is  Unsanity officially dead?

734420,comment,733877,734357,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The reason I did it was because I'd been asked by an Amsterdam cultural center (the meervaart) to show the people living near it during a presentation how the situation would change upon expanding the meervaart.<p>The director (Han Hogeland) had asked me to do the presentation in exchange for - no laughing please - an old French car that I'd wanted to buy of him (Citroen DS).<p>This made me <i>very</i> motivated to make it work, only my 16 Mhz 386/387 combo really wasn't fast enough to make it work and I didn't have enough dough for a weitek.<p>So, from desperation this little hack was born. After I found out that it worked (much to my surprise, actually, testing on 20 MHz) I went to a friend who had a computer store and went through several trays of 387's before finding one that would still run at 40 Mhz, and with a large cooling element attached it even stayed reasonably cool (no fan).<p>The hardest part really was to cut the line on the mb without damage to other lines (this was a multi layer board), eventually I traced the line to a so called 'via' where I could scratch out the connection topside and use the remains of the via to connect the xtal oscillator (in a socket so I could try various frequencies).<p>The whole thing worked pretty good even if it looked absolutely terrible (imagine an ic socket piggy backed on top of a ttl IC for power and ground, then a wire running to a via next to a severed trace).<p>It's a pity I didn't make any pictures of the whole thing, I do still have the aerial photographs we bought of the cartographic institution that were digitized to get the layout in to the software, then extrusion by estimated building height created a fairly realistic view of the area.<p>The shading was quite primitive, framerate about 2-3 frames / second depending on the amount of stuff in the field of view. The graphics board was a 3x5 bits 512x512 pixels affair whose name escapes me atm.<p>And I got the car :)",1249048623

I wrote a program that wrote the assignment for me.

734338,comment,734116,734116,0,0,jasongullickson,,,"I have loved the Automobile, but now I am quitting the Automobile.<p>This is not an easy decision.<p>I was there in January 2007 when it was announced and I bought the first Automobile as soon as it was available. I happily bought the Automobile 3G a year later. I’ve proudly yelled “I Am A Member Of The Cult Of Automobile.” I’ve been an unabashed cheerleader for this mode of transportation to all who’ll listen. And I’ve scoffed at drivers who said they’d abandon the platform.<p>But I’m not going to upgrade to the Automobile 3GS. Instead, I’m abandoning the Automobile and DOT. I will grudgingly pay the $175 DOT unregitration fee and then I will move on to another mode of transportation.<p>What finally put me over the edge? It wasn’t the routinely congested highways, something you can only truly understand once you have owned an Automobile (and which drove my friend Om Malik to bail). I’ve lived with that for two years. It’s not the lack of parking spaces at home. I’ve lived with that for two years, too. It certainly isn’t the lack of a feed bag, that has never bothered me. No, what finally put me over the edge is the speeding debacle.<p>Most of you won’t know what I’m talking about, so I’ll explain.<p>Speeding is a way to get where you're going faster than everyone else. Here’s an overview of the service if you aren’t familiar with it.<p>I’ve always wanted to use speeding but there’s a big switching cost - crashing your automobile and dying. Too many roads are not built well enough to operate an automobile at sustained high speeds and are too dangerous to use for speeding.<p>But now Firestone is planning on rolling out a new line of tires that are supposed to handle well at high-speed, so I can drive as fast as I want no matter what condition the road is in.<p>Or so I thought. Chevrolet and the DOT are now making speeding illegal. Why? Because they absolutely don’t want people doing exactly what I’m doing - driving as fast as they want and using their roads as a racetrack.<p>So I have to choose between the Automobile and speeding. It’s not an easy decision. Except, it sort of is. Firestone isn’t forcing the decision on me, Chevrolet and the DOT are. So I choose to work with the company that isn’t forcing me to do things their way. And in this case, that’s Firestone.<p>So what mode of transportation will I use next? Well, that decision is easy, too. I’d move to the goat because I believe it is the best vehicle out there other than the Automobile 3GS. But Firestone hasn’t created a tire for the goat yet, just motorcycle and bicycles. So for now I’m going to use the new bicycle speeding tires. As soon as something better comes out, or Firestone makes an tire for the goat, I’ll switch. And keep on speeding. No long commute to work for me.<p>And Chevrolet, if you ever decide to put the hammer down on DOT and do the right thing for your loyal customers, I’ll consider switching back. In the meantime, I’ll just use one of many go-karts parked in the garage to test out new roads.",1249046687

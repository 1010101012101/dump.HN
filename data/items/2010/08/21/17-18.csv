More importantly, the implementation strategy is unique as far as I know.<p>Now it’s not uncommon to overvalue ideas, but the fact is that I do value a number of the ideas involved quite highly. To a large extent, I believe that they’re going to be critical to fighting competitors.<p>I’d love to be able to hire someone to help speed development, but I’m concerned about opening the codebase to any outsiders at this point.<p>What is the general consensus when it comes to these kinds of trust issues?<p>I can definitely continue on as I have been, working by myself - but I feel there’d be an advantage to getting out the door ASAP. And even if I get out the door by myself, the idea has a lot of growth potential - too much for one person to handle adequately.<p>The matter is complicated by the fact that the chances of finding someone with the right technical knowledge in my country are about nil: so I’d need to trust someone I don’t personally know, and that I’m only indirectly in contact with.<p>I’ve got trust issues, generally, so maybe I’m overreacting? Still, I can’t help shake the fear that a contract developer is going to (un)-intentionally leak code now or in the future.",1282413521

When I designed a Harvard architecture chip (8051 derivative) into a product, I added an external address space mapper to turn it into a von Neumann architecture.  The software folks had to write a custom file system/linker/loader and were <i>thankful</i>.  The alternative was painfully reprogramming the chip with every recompile.<p>Re. #5, the large system developers I know <i>love</i> them their C# and sing the praises of Microsoft for making C/C++ avoidable.  Their 500 kLOC distributed system integration project would be nearly untenable if they had to manually get every container iteration and bounds check exactly right.  And Microsoft does not talk about it much, but I get the impression that they have been running heavy code reviews and static analyzers on their C/C++ software.  At least there seems to have been a decline in exploitable bounds check errors.",1282413319

This story just gets better and better.<p>So how do you have a rape allegation by two separate women (as I understand it?) that is baseless? I understand how the <i>charges</i> could be baseless, but the prosecution's job should be to determine if the allegations have merit, not try the case. So why do the charges have merit one day and not the next?<p>Look, if there is a charge, investigate it. If not, don't. But charging him one day and withdrawing the next just leads to even more conspiracy theory madness.<p>What this <i>sounds</i> like is ""Well if he was just Joe Blow, we would have arrested him, but given the nature of his stature...""<p>I'm sure that's not the case, however.

Absolutely.<p>But Julian Assange is not Salvador Allende.<p>The US can't even figure out how to assassinate key military adversaries based on Baluchistan, one of the most violent and contentious areas in the world.<p>The idea that they'd be scheming to kill someone simply out of spite (for nothing they do at this point to Assange is going to keep the machinery he's put in motion from publishing every document disclosed to him) is an insult to our intelligence.<p>I reply to comments like this not because I'm a great believer in US intelligence and foreign policy (I'm not) and not because I'm a philosophical opponent to Wikileaks (though I am).

1623258,comment,1623252,1623252,0,0,mawhidby,,,"I would choose invisibility, because I believe it offers more chances for good, evil, privacy, and just plain fun. I would want to keep my invisibility as big of a secret as possible; I wouldn't want to be known for my power, so I'd have to be careful when going into and out of invisibility.<p>Here's some example scenarios I thought up:<p>Fun:<p>- Messing with people's minds (which some may consider evil). For example, making them think their house is haunted. Slam doors, move furniture, flip switches, unplug stuff, etc.<p>- Instigate confrontations (may also be considered evil). Make someone think they shoved them, hit them, etc.<p>- Going into restricted areas just to see what's there.<p>- Listening to what people have to say about me when I'm not there (may end up being depressing...)<p>- People-watching for hours without looking creepy or suspicious<p>- Just doing normal things while invisible. See people's reactions while you drive a car, ride a bike, etc., while invisible. Doing that too often may draw too much attention to myself, though.<p>Good:<p>- Infiltrating terrorist cells; I'd be able to gain information relatively safely, maybe find Osama?<p>- Security. I can scream and throw shit to scare the hell out of people from stealing stuff.<p>- Crime-fighting. This is a toughie to imagine scenarios where an invisible man would stop crime, especially if you want to remain unknown. News reports about an invisible person fighting crime would definitely not be something I'm looking for. I'd probably have to learn some martial arts so I can actually kick some ass, and bulk up some. And it's not like you can dodge bullets; if criminals caught on and were aware of your presence, they would just pray-and-spray all over the place, and you'd be sure to get hit at some point. If the criminals aren't armed with firearms, then it could be easier.<p>Evil:<p>- Stealing stuff. Assuming that if I'm able to fit an object into my pocket or under a shirt/jacket, it will become invisibile, then it's fair game.<p>- Infiltrating governments, agencies, etc. for classified information. Maybe it will be considered good if I give the information to Wikileaks? :P<p>- Murder, or any extreme crimes. Any eyewitnesses would be completely baffled.<p>Miscellaneous thoughts:<p>- Useful for if you are trying to avoid someone, or conversely, if someone is trying to avoid you.<p>- If you've ever wanted to just disappear from the world for a little bit, you got it!<p>- I'd assume that while invisible, you don't just pass through someone or something, you still have to walk around it. So it would be annoying to constantly avoid people and objects while you walk around, especially if you're trying to be secretive about your power, or not alert people to your presence.  No chance for clumsiness!<p>- It's always best to have a complimentary power, like super-strength. Just one superpower doesn't always cut it, especially for fighting crime.<p>That's all I'll put, it's getting too long.",1282412635

That's so far, anyway.<p>I'd actually gone to a lot of trouble to define input and outputs precisely (in set notation, using LaTeX), and defining explicit constraints/relations between them, and even outlining proofs. This was a lot of work, and the process did increase my clarity of understanding, but it hasn't helped me at all in reading it - in <i>communicating</i> to myself. I guess proofs are primarily about proving, not communicating.\nAnother problem with proofs is that the best way to conceptualize/visualize an algorithm for the purpose of proving it may be quite different from the best way to grasp it intuitively. Proofs are not primarily operational.<p>Re: defining terms in the article: I think metaphors can act like definitions of terms, and are very helpful for communication. An apt metaphor can imply all kinds of behaviours and interactions that the reader already knows, enabling them to quickly grasp your meaning in a few words. I think it's arguable that our thinking is actually metaphorical, in that we interpret new ideas in terms of existing ideas; even to the point of tools being neurophysical extensions of our arms.\nThe difficulty with apt metaphors is finding them; and before you can do that, you need a <i>very</i> clear understanding of what you mean. Improving my own understanding is probably the best way to improve my write up of it... though, writing it up definitely also helps improve my understanding, as implementing it also does.<p>---<p>So, an iterative back-and-force process between notes, writing, thinking and implementation is probably the most effective route to clearer understanding and therefore clearer writing.",1282410582

That wont give you an indication of whether or not a company is necessarily a fraud, but it will give you the opportunity to know who is being aggressive with their accounting. And if they are being aggressive you should probably stay away.<p>There are a ton of books out there on forensic accounting (Financial Shenanigans, Creative Cash Flow Reporting, Quality of Earnings, Financial Fine Print -- Along with changes to GAAP and IFRS) where if you have read all of them you should be able to pick out weird issues with accounting.<p>The other benefit of investing in small companies is you can in general get better access to CEOs and managers. If you were to invest in JNJ, the chance of you getting to talk to the CEO is slim. But with a lot of nano-cap companies you can actually go visit with the CEO and start quizzing him to see if he is BSing you or if he is actually smart and competent. I like to ask the same questions to two competing CEOs and see how their answers differ. You can really go as deep as you want when investigating some CEOs. You can start visiting their community, talking to people who are active with them in organizations. Just a lot of work to really scrub their background and get at who they are. Plus, these businesses tend to have fewer moving parts too, so you can analyze them in greater detail.",1282410060

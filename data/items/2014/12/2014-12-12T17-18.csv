For the second issue I use a shortcut that cds the path of the front-most Finder window using AppleScript. You can have QuickLook in the terminal too by the way:<p><pre><code>    # Quicklook given file
    ql () {
    	qlmanage -p $* 2>/dev/null
    }
</code></pre>
And one tweak I often use is that I have mapped Ctrl-Shift-t to the &quot;Tags...&quot; menu entry which can be done in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts > + > Application=Finder, Menu Title=Tags...<p>You can have something like cd .. in Finder using Cmd-up and cd - is Cmd-[. When you Cmd-click the icon in the window title bar you can see the whole path, which I use a lot too. Finally, I use Cmd-2 and Cmd-3 to switch between column and list view.",1418407071

The vote approved procedures under which the board will cut off the benefits, which, officials said, are costing the agency $2 million a month. >><p>A bunch of the people involved have gone to prison over this fraud:<p><< The first terminations came several weeks after the doctor who submitted what prosecutors have said was the bogus medical evidence underlying the applications of the roughly 600 retired railroad workers pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to fraud and conspiracy. The doctor, Peter J. Ajemian, told the judge in January that the retirees were not in fact disabled. …<p>Dr. Ajemian, who was sentenced to eight years in prison, is among 24 people — including retirees, another doctor and two facilitators — who since 2011 have pleaded guilty to federal charges resulting from of the investigation. Charges against eight other people indicted in the case are pending, and the investigation by the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, officials have said, is continuing. >><p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/nyregion/600-long-island-rail-road-retirees-lose-disability-pay-in-us-inquiry.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/nyregion/600-long-island-r...</a>",1418406558

8741485,comment,8738646,8741268,0,0,zaroth,,,"There&#x27;s definitely a qualitative argument. Certainly that&#x27;s what you see if you turn on any ad-supported media, and you&#x27;re inundated with that &quot;quality of life&quot; everyone is <i>selling</i> to the middle-class.<p>But for example, you can pay ~$1000/mo for a family of 4 for &quot;Silver&quot; health insurance and earning > $63k you would have to pay the full amount. Credits pay for almost the entire cost (aka $12,000 of tax-free income from the Fed) if your household income is $33k. So under just one program (ACA), $30k of incremental work disqualifies you from $12k of assistance. And that&#x27;s for the same exact plan/service.<p>Then you get below $33k household income and instead of paying thousands for a Silver plan with a $6,000 family deductible, you pay basically nothing and have no deductible for Medicaid / Medi-Cal. That&#x27;s effectively a $24,000 / year value for a family of 4. [1]<p>In both cases, you can argue about access to top-specialists for chronic care, but certainly access to acute care coverage is equivalent (i.e. hospitals can&#x27;t base their ER services based on ability to pay). In many ways Medicaid is better because deductibles are a hell of a lot lower than $13,500 Bronze / $6,000 Silver.<p>By the way, Whole Foods takes food stamps. So that&#x27;s another example where you get straight up cash for not working. Up to $8,400 / year, cash on a debit card, which phases out as household income goes to ~$30k / year (plus allowed deductions) for a family of 4. [2]<p>If you have a qualifying disability and have to make the choice of giving up work and going on DI, assuming you have the work history credits, it&#x27;s another up to $31,000 / year of income (not entirely tax-free though). [3]<p>That&#x27;s over $60k right there, and there are many more programs to account. It would add up to well over $100k except you can&#x27;t fully stack all of the programs, e.g. CA SDI payments count against SSDI payments.<p>I was thinking about making a &quot;how much do you lose by working&quot; micro-site as an excuse to play with D3 and interactive visualization, targeted to residents of California, but the whole thing was too infuriating I haven&#x27;t mustered the motivation to do it.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.coveredca.com/shopandcompare/#incomeGuidelines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coveredca.com/shopandcompare/#incomeGuidelines</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.stanworks.com/community-reports/other-services/content.php?nav=food-stamps/food-stamps-faq.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanworks.com/community-reports/other-services/co...</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/how-much-in-ssd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/how-much-in-ssd.html</a>",1418405892

  * lots of resources-tracking knobs thanks to cgroups

See the collections reform RFC (<a href=""https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/collections-conventions/text/0000-collection-conventions.md#lack-of-iterator-methods"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/collections-conventions/...</a>) for details on that example. There are many, many others.<p>I suspect that HKT&#x27;s role in Rust will be much more about extending the trait system for generic programming, rather than full-blown monadic programming.",1418404873

I&#x27;m primarily a web developer, and I really want to get into systems programming, but I have no idea what to do with it or where to start. I wound up implementing about 50 different Rosetta Code things in Rust 0.9 and 0.10, but I still never came up with a really solid use-case that I could start and finish.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve been really impressed by rust-doom (<a href=""https://github.com/cristicbz/rust-doom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cristicbz/rust-doom</a>) and the new Iota editor (<a href=""https://github.com/gchp/iota"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gchp/iota</a>), and I wish I had the know-how to even start down that path.<p>2) Given that the last time I touched systems programming was in college (15 years ago), I&#x27;ve found it difficult to wrap my head around some of the concepts (ownership in particular). I actually hung out in the IRC chat room for awhile, but I felt more than a few times that people were treating me like an idiot because of my questions (&quot;Ha! You did X? Why in the world would you do that??&quot;), so I wound up not really going back.

Most of Angular&#x27;s quirks can be worked around using common sense, and as in some cases, using the right tools, understanding Angular isn&#x27;t a silver bullet goes a long way too. The issues my team encountered won&#x27;t be encountered by everyone, we were dealing with potentially thousands of items being in the page caused by infinite scrolling.<p>I get that some people think Angular is difficult, learning the basics is easy, learning how to use Angular the right way is the hard part. I think a lot of the issues people encounter using Angular are due to their own limited understanding of the framework. The documentation leaves a lot to be desired, but there are a lot of good blog posts out there like this which tell you upfront the issues and best practices.<p>The beautiful thing about Angular is that it is not difficult to get it to shows its warts, so you can work around or fix them. Combined with Batarang, you can get a pretty insightful look into your application and where you can improve it as well. A lot of the issues we&#x27;ve encountered were due to the fact someone on the team did something wrong expecting it to work, not Angular itself. Like a good woodworker, you&#x27;ve got to go with the grain, not against it.<p>I think if our application were being built from the ground up today, the team unanimously agrees that we would use something like React + Flux. But in our case, the business wouldn&#x27;t be too happy with us throwing away old unit tested and battle-tested code in favour of something new and lean for the sake of a few milliseconds of browser performance.",1418403807

When you defined those options you were thinking of all the cases where you invoke less, or at least where you knew less was being invoked.<p>Now journalctl defaults to use a pager if you invoke it.

That breaks so many rules it&#x27;s just sad.<p>Hmm.. Not in my world. The author was launching journalctl, not journalctl | less (which, as others have pointed out, would probably work as he expects it to). If you launch &#x27;foo&#x27; and it doesn&#x27;t do what you want and aren&#x27;t an expert in all things &#x27;foo&#x27;, read man foo.<p>Which, for foo=journalctl, spells out that<p>- there is an option to stop truncating very long fields<p>- there is an option to use no pager<p>- the default pager is less<p>- the default less configuration is as quoted above<p>If you launch journalctl, see output you don&#x27;t like and _don&#x27;t_ skim the manual?

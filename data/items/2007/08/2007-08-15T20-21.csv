42803,comment,42627,42781,0,0,Darmani,,,"Interesting. I checked Wikipedia again, and apparently the issue of Napoleon's height is in dispute.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte#Napoleon.27s_height"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte#Napoleon.27s...</a><p>""Many historians have recently argued that, contrary to popular belief, Napoleon was not short as often depicted in popular culture. Although historians disagree on Napoleon's precise height, it has been suggested that he was actually slightly taller than the average early 19th-century Frenchman.[27] Some historians claim the French emperor's height was recorded as 5 ft. 2 in French units, corresponding to 1.68 meters or 5 ft. 6 in Imperial units.""",1187211352
42802,comment,42508,42548,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""but if this company was started solely by hackers it would not be nearly as good""<p>Interesting bit of prejudice here.  What makes a hacker less capable of doing whatever it is that non-hackers do?  Is it the thick held-together-with-tape glasses?  Maybe the caffeine addiction addled brain?<p>The neat thing about an all-hacker startup is that hackers can choose NOT to hack part or all of their time when the job calls for it.  A non-hacker doesn't have the ability to shift gears during the early days of the product to just work on shipping the damned thing.<p>I'm a hacker, and have code running on millions of machines world-wide in numerous Open Source projects, but in our startup today, I predominantly do not hack.  I still spend about 25% of my time hacking, but it's becoming less every month, as other aspects of the company become more pressing (marketing/evangelism, money management, support, hiring contractors, design, etc.).  I happen to have a lot of business experience, as well, and I don't think that J Random Hacker would step right into this kind of position without some study and work, but to imagine that being an all-hacker company would lead to it being ""not nearly as good"" is funny.  Hackers are people, generally smarter than average.  Many happen to have other skills and experience outside of hacking.<p>I'm just picking on you, of course.  I'm sure you didn't mean to imply that there are magical skills that disappear when one becomes a hacker, or that the hacker mentality is a form of retardation that dramatically negatively impacts other skills.",1187211088

Hopefully, everyone can keep their politics in their basements and the hacker theme stays.  That's why I stopped reading reddit daily.

42793,comment,42317,42750,0,0,dfranke,,,"Reddit held out longer than three months.  I remember remarking to spez during Startup School '06 that I had noticed a recent, slight downtrend in quality.  That was around the time that random photographs started appearing on the front page, and a couple weeks after the famous ""Paul Graham Eats Breakfast"" post.  But it was far from nonsense then: the majority of front page content was still excellent.  Reddit launched in late summer '05, so that's at least 8 months that it held out.",1187209673

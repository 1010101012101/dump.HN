Does anyone really think merging with them is going to do anything positive for Yahoo?<p>2. Yahoo has two sources of value. First, it's an incredibly successful content brand, with sites like Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, and a boatload of others. Second, it's the #2 player and only remotely plausible competitor to Google in search and internet advertising.<p>Even if Yahoo keeps it's own search team, it won't matter, because Google will really be the only source of keyword advertising on the internet. Even if Yahoo were to own Google in search, Google would still get a lot of the money.<p>This move would effectively lock in Google's monopoly over keyword advertising for good, and it would mean that Yahoo is giving up on being a technology company to become a content company and embrace the slow, painful decline that befell Netscape, Lycos, AOL, and other companies that lost the source of the value they added to the internet.",1207857570

    >   (bar 2))     ; => 4
</code></pre>
(Naturally, if instead of set! you do (let ((foo 2)) ...), it gives 3 again. But that's creating a new lexical scope, whereas in your example both definitions of foo are in the same scope, as is the definition of bar. I think.)<p>OTOH,<p><pre><code>    > (define (bar n) (+ foo n))

My understanding of dynamic variables is that bar would see the value of foo just defined, and return 3. Am I confused?<p>(Tested with guile 1.6.7, which I gather is pretty old. Maybe that's the problem?)<p>edit: tested this in perl as well, with local to create dynamic variables.<p><pre><code>    sub bar { print($foo + shift(), ""\n""); }

The answer is that we expect this data, while limited and simple within an application, to be combined, later, with data from other applications into a Web. Applications which run over the whole web must be able to use a common framework for combining information from all these applications. For example, access control logic may use a combination of privacy and group membership and data type information to actually allow or deny access. Queries may later allow powerful logical expressions referring to data from domains in which, individually, the data representation language is not very expressive.<p>I'm not sure if this quote supports my point of view or yours, or even if there's any factual difference between our views.",1207855733

The people who make the drug laws are either idiotic or spineless politicians, the people who enforce them are sadistic bullies, and the people who support the system are uninformed morons, latent Fascists or nosy busybodies.<p>In fact the entire drug war is actually a proxy for a cultural conflict between conformist and nonconformist elements in society.  It's common for conforming bullies to be enabled to abuse nonconforming weird kids by school authorities.  The drug war is that at a huge scale.<p>A few commonly seen fallacies include that use does not mean abuse.  Use can be beneficial (see Carl Sagan, Steve Jobs).  Abuse is not always a net negative (see, Paul Erdos, the rock and roll hall of fame).  Addicts can function fine in society (cofounder of hopkins).<p>If some scientist looking for a cancer cure wants to take speed or provigil to help them work, more power to them.  Do you want to tell families suffering from Alzhihmers that their cure was delayed because the best researcher was arrested for taking ADD medication to hold the complexities of the disease in her memory as she worked on a cure?  How much time should a cancer researcher, using a mental performance booster and trying to find a cure be put in jail?<p>In fact, I would argue that, for brilliant scientists working on saving lives, the obligation to dedicate themselves fully to their work in much more pressing then the obligation to follow idiotic, racist, superstitious laws.  In fact, much scientific progress came from scientific people breaking dumb superstitious laws and societal conventions.  See, for example, early researches in anatomy, which the church treated as unholy, or early research in astronomy.  So if researchers (particularly researchers who save lives) want to do this, it's part of a long, illustrious tradition of ignoring irrational rules to get science done.<p>But then I care more about progress and a cure for these things then the particulars of what metabolites are in the urine of the researchers that found it.

9833248,comment,9833111,9833111,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"The article seems to say:  &quot;Feminists annoy me because they are right&quot;.<p>This is not why feminists annoy me, though. I don&#x27;t think they are right at all. So the title of the blog post seems to extrapolate her own views out into a universal truth.<p>This sort of thinking is especially dangerous:<p><i>> With the same high school grades a white person has a 78% higher chance of being admitted to a university than a person of color</i><p>I do not know where this stat comes from as she provides a cartoon instead of a reference, but assuming it&#x27;s not a trivially bogus stat (e.g. because of differences in application rates), it sounds a lot like it could be a Simpson&#x27;s Paradox:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson&#x27;s_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson&#x27;s_paradox</a><p>The very same argument was made to suggest a gender bias in admissions at an American university (Berkeley): when you selected just people with the same grades, more men were accepted than women. Sexual discrimination!!!<p>The problem is, when they tried to figure out which department was discriminating, the bias disappeared (actually became slightly in favour of women). It turned out to be a statistical anomaly caused by the fact that women tended to apply for much more competitive courses than men, like English Lit, so they were rejected more often due to overcapacity - not due to their gender. When you select only application rates and gender, this type of data abuse causes misleading conclusions.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>know</i> that the race stat is another example of this, but I find it hard to believe that such a dramatic case of racism across so many institutions could persist for so long without severe legal problems, if it was as open and shut as Felienne suggests.<p>Final issue I have with this blog post:<p><i>> You believe God put dinosaur bones in the earth to test your faith, you think vaccines cause autism? Yes, that’s crazy but also funny haha who cares?</i><p>The first is harmless belief that doesn&#x27;t normally impact other people, the second triggers preventable outbreaks of exceptionally serious diseases. So lots of people care and parents opting out of vaccinations is a very controversial issue right now! It seems very strange to use this as an example!",1436097595

9833245,comment,9833111,9833111,0,0,danso,,,"> <i>1 They remind us that the world is not a fair place, which contradict the Just World hypothesis. Simply said: people want the world to be fair and they happily refute evidence of the contradiction. So if girls in tech say they have less opportunity, we all love to believe they are wrong. The world cannot be unfair, could it? So: they must be wrong. This is, of course, untrue. There are many studies done proving that there is some subtle bias, like the one where resumes with a male name were rated as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant.</i><p>I&#x27;ve often wondered how much being Asian-American has contributed to my current life of being a programmer. Throughout school and college, I&#x27;ve never shown any particular passion or innate skill. But I got a lot of subtle encouragement, such as from my immigrant parents who thought majoring in computer engineering would be practical even though I was much more into journalism. After college I didn&#x27;t even bother looking for programming jobs, but I gradually got moved more and more into programming roles...the engineering degree helped, but I have to guess that some of it was a <i>lot</i> of benefit of the doubt given to me, based on me <i>looking</i> like a computer nerd or having the stereotypical math aptitude attributed to Asians (I&#x27;m also pretty average at math). After enough years of this, I&#x27;m not a pretty competent and passionate programming...but it seems hardly by active choice. I believe the average young woman probably doesn&#x27;t get as many chances or benefits of the doubt that I have.",1436097574

Simply said: people want the world to be fair and they happily refute evidence of the contradiction.<p>2. People want to believe they are reasonable creatures themselves.<p>3. Accepting that there is a bias against women, means you must accept there is a bias in favor of men.<p>The problem here is not that women want equal rights. No rational actor wants equal rights, only increased rights. It is very disingenuous to talk about a &quot;white privilege&quot; or a &quot;male privilege&quot; without acknowledging there are privileges that come from being $input_race and $input_gender. Of course, people of $input_race and $input_gender will usually not complain about the privileges they get.<p>It is absolutely OK to seek parity in terms of rights. It is understandable that people seek greater rewards for themselves. Lets just not delude ourselves into thinking that what we want is equality when what we really want is better rights and greater rewards for ourselves.<p>If feminism is about equality in rights and responsibility regardless of gender or sexual identity, there are a lot of people around who go by the wrong name.<p>Downvoters: please leave a note.",1436097133

Unikernels and other library OS projects and performance oriented projects are putting what was system code into userspace where it can be iterated faster, and moving to high level and scripting languages. Comtainers and microservices are causing a huge rethink of the monolithic architectures too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://operatingsystems.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://operatingsystems.io/</a>",1436095244
9833184,comment,9832593,9832593,0,0,michaelt,,,"Back in Windows 98 there was a feature called &#x27;Active Desktop&#x27; that could use web pages as desktop wallpaper (or partial desktop wallpaper). It was intended to be an early version of desktop widgets like stock tickers. As these were basically web pages, you could refresh for the same reasons you might refresh in a web browser.<p>As you could execute javascript it was also possible to do things like change your desktop wallpaper when you resized or rotated your screen. But active desktop was never heavily used enough to have all the bugs in it sorted out - if you widget&#x27;s javascript tried to display a message box you could trigger a crash, for example.<p>I assume that feature is gone now - but presumably you can still put files on the desktop, so presumably there&#x27;s a refresh button in case you have some strange configuration like your desktop folder mounted from a network share.",1436095192

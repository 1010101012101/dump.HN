Your perception of how easy is to shoot yourself in the foot with them or how ugly is the code you have to write may stem from a biased point-of-view.

It is related to the price of the company doing the round-trading (and if people notice what is going on, the price will probably crumble to pieces).<p>Sorry that I did not read the whole article, but I am weary of all those articles that try to blame evil traders and markets for everything. It just comes in so handy because it is a complex system - so if you say ""it is their fault"", it is difficult to argue against it.<p>In reality I don't see how riskless trading should be possible. Buying futures is not riskless.<p>In that sense, I don't think trading can be evil per se. What is evil is to lie to people about the real value of things, and thus selling them crap.

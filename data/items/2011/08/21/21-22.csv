I stumbled across this little gem:<p><i>Soon came VidCaster, a service for Web sites to add video; it was started by Kieran Farr, a taxi driver turned chief executive. He said his service had absolute stickiness  meaning that it lures Internet users to stick around for a long time.<p>Whats the gross margin of the business look like? asked George Zachary of Charles River Ventures.<p>What does that mean? Mr. Farr said.<p>Thats a problem.<p>Average score: 2.8.</i><p>I happen to know Kieran Farr quite well.  <a href=""http://www.vidcaster.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vidcaster.com/</a> was one of the first companies in our Co-op incubator.   And, I have no doubt, that Kieran is going to be far richer than some reporter who still makes his living writing for a company that think that selling yesterday's news written on pieces of dead tree is a viable business model.<p>Kieran, and his co founders moved to Silicon Valley 2 years ago and the bottom of the economic bust.  They've been doing corporate video for years together, and saw a huge problem in the market.  They would get paid thousands of dollars to shoot corporate videos, and then have to upload it to YouTube for streaming, rather than on a company branded web site.  So, they created a product around a big problem they found companies having.<p>Kieran is a self taught hacker, and he chose to drive cab for a living while boot strapping his company because it paid fairly well, and allowed him the flexibility to boot strap and take a few hours off in the afternoon for  investor / client meetings when he needed to.<p>Kieran was the chief back end engineer, and shortly after they joined the our boot strapped incubator ( we didn't have any money to invest), and we were trying to figure out how to convince investors to fund VicCaster.<p>Hackers & Founders hosted a presentation by Naval entitled, Hacking your funding process:  <a href=""http://hackersandfounders.tv/T7F/naval-ravikant-hack-your-funding/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackersandfounders.tv/T7F/naval-ravikant-hack-your-fu...</a><p>And, we decided to set up a VidCaster site called <a href=""http://Hackersandfounders.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Hackersandfounders.tv</a>,  push the Naval presentation onto that site, try to get as many views as possible, and use that to showcase what VidCaster does.<p>VidCaster (while broke, driving cab and eating ramen noodles) handled 1TB of bandwidth in the 7 days after we put Naval's presentation online.  They arranged for a sponsorship contract with Microsoft BizSpark, and handled everything from picking up the video from the AV guy at the presentation, to the uploading to the encoding.  And, they did an amazing job.<p>Damn straight, their service has ""stickiness"".  Imagine the pain in the ass it would be for me to get the videos that VidCaster is hosting at <a href=""http://hackersandfounders.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackersandfounders.tv</a> moved elsewhere?  And, really... how the fuck do you calculate a gross margin when you have a boot strapped startup with 10 paying clients?<p>Shortly thereafter, we introduced VidCaster to 500 startups, and they got funded.  Their paying clients at the time included AirBnb, ZendDesk, Twilio and Microsoft.  They just presented at 500 Startups demo day, and another VC after seeing Kieran's Demo said, ""VidCaster's amazing.  All my portfolio companies need to be using their service"".<p>Pretty soon, they are going to be rolling out a service that allows a customer to have any of their uploaded videos automatically transcribed, so that transcript can be downloaded and indexed by search engines.<p>Not bad technical chops for someone who is just a ""cab driver"".<p>VidCaster knows the online video market cold.  They run an amazing business.  They help other companies make money, and they had revenue before even getting funded.<p>It's companies like VidCaster that made me put my own startup aside, boot strap an incubator with no money of my own, and do whatever we could to get them funded.  Bubble, my ass.<p>It's going to be entrepreneurs like Kieran, Ray and Steve (the VidCaster founders) that lead this country out of the economic mess it's in.  They've been work their assess off on their startup for years, and they do whatever it takes to keep their company going.  Even, if that means driving a cab while coding.  These guys are fucking heroes if you ask me.<p>But then again, I moonlight as an ER Nurse. What do I know?  Must be a bubble.<p>Fuck the New York Times.  \n</rant>",1313963960

All of which in my history would have been better off with an hourly billing.<p>The number of bodies were talking about makes a big difference, and the larger that number is the more a fixed rate person/week makes sense.  Just like the larger consulting firms its all about placing a lot of people for a long time, +/- 1 week here or there won't matter.  You mitigate the risk and it makes sense to take it on spread across the team and only as granular as weeks. Agreed your system works really well with those scenarios.<p>I interpreted the the original post was an individual who provides consulting service where 1 week could make a difference, 20% overage on a 1 month project.

2910408,comment,2908802,2909138,3,0,bl,,,"Maximum firing rate differs between neuron types (i.e., cortical pyramidal neurons versus cerebellar Purkinje neurons) dependent upon cellular membrane properties (dendrite diameter and ion channel distributions, etc.), but a good rule-of-thumb to keep in mind is 1 kHz. That maximum ""firing rate"" is about as fast as a patch of membrane can generate an action potential (AP, or ""spike""), reset, and fire another.<p>All that said, a relevant question to ask is, ""What is the information content of a single action potential?"" There is not an agreed-upon answer among neuroscientists. The metaphor linking brain and a personal computer is extremely strained: to start, it is not quite true that neurons can carry out logical functions. Neurons are firmly rooted in the analog domain and it is much more straightforward to infer polynomial-type computations from their physiology, the order and coefficients being dictated by the particulars of the scenario. Also, the current thinking is that information is encoded in bursts or repetitive APs, called ""spike trains"". But if we must, I'd throw out a range of 0.5 to 5 bits per spike [Rieke, et al.]. (If you want to go down a rabbit hole and explore one of <i>the</i> pivotal topics among people studying neural computation, look up ""rate coding"" versus ""temporal coding"". Perhaps even phrasing the question that way is misleading.)<p>Here's a side note that may be of interest: during an AP, the trans-membrane voltage swings from approximately -100 mV to +100 mV (very rough figures). If you consider that this potential difference is applied across the 3 nano-meter thick cell membrane, the resulting electric field is very close to the dielectric breakdown voltage for phospholipid membranes. Our neurons are constantly operating within a factor or two of literally destroying themselves! (The preceding paragraph contains very back-of-the-envelope reasoning. To be more rigorous, I'd have to dig out my notes and reference materials, but the general point nonetheless holds.)",1313963402

But the way he approaches it, as a question of choosing what to think, is fundamentally, <i>tragically</i> wrong.<p>To Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy folks call that focusing on cognition rather than experience. It's the classic fallacy of beginning meditators, who believe the secret lies in choosing what to think, or in fact choosing not to think at all.

I must change my thinking so that the suffering stops.""<p>In fact, the fundamental tenet of mindfulness is that this is <i>impossible</i>.

We have a special word to describe these people: <i>depressed</i>.<p>The ""trick"" to both Buddhist mindfulness and MBCT, and the cure for depression if such a thing exists, lies in accepting that we are as powerless over our thoughts and emotions as we are over our circumstances. My mind, the ""master"" DFW talks about, <i>is part of the water.</i> If I am angry that an SUV cut me off, I must experience anger. If I'm disgusted by the fat woman in front of me in the supermarket, I must experience disgust. When I am joyful, I must experience joy, and when I suffer, I must experience suffering. There is no other option but death or madness the quiet madness that pervades most peoples' lives as they suffer day in and day out in their frantic quest to avoid suffering.<p>Experience. Awareness. Acceptance. <i>Never thought</i>you can't be mindful by thinking about mindfulness, it's an oxymoron. You have to just feel it.<p>There's something indescribably heartbreaking in hearing him come so <i>close</i> to finding the cure, to miss it only by a hair, knowing what happens next.<p>[Full disclosure: My mother is a psychiatrist who dabbles in MBCT. It cured her depression, and mine.]",1313962866

One part strikes me as especially noteworthy:<p>Lieberman, Michel, and colleagues expect that some 15 of the 98 modern irregular verbs they studied -- although likely none of these top 10 -- will regularize in the next 500 years.<p>Now, is this based on previous evolution of verbs? Because the past thousand years have had a certain feasibility of communication, locally, nationally and globally. I think the past 100 years with the advent of radio, television and now the internet, language is really going to evolve at a rate previously unseen in history.<p>The whole globe is connected, textually, verbally and visually, and it's immediate and constant. The past thousand years the only way to get your novel usage of a particular word or grammatical construct was to either go to some venue and talk, send a letter, or write a book. Now you can spread your literary love everywhere, constantly and with a wide audience. And not only to people with your local dialect, but <i>every</i> dialect. What a melting pot.<p>I'm quite a lover of language evolution. I moved to Italy a year ago in a very multilingual office, and my French and Italian colleagues noted how nice it is in English that you can verb nouns. It hadn't occurred to me that this wasn't possible in French or Italian. I expressed that though English is quite liberal and almost anything goes in a lot of areas, I still wish that people were more accepting of linguistic novelties. People scorn you if you play with language, or actively drop old ways, or invent new words, with the exception of high school kids who, in my experience, are the most inventive English speakers I've seen. When I was in school the amount of new language and idioms introduced every week was overwhelming.<p>I'm quite descriptivist, though. I like dictionaries that are extremely up to date, like [Wordnik](<a href=""http://www.wordnik.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wordnik.com/</a>), that encourage people to just use words freely, and take 3 seconds to explain to their partner in conversation what the word means, without fear that their new word isn't <i>cromulent</i>!

It's just that increases in 'productivity' don't always mean an increase in standard of living, quality of life, better society, etc.<p>All I addressed was productivity, not standard of living, 'the social contract', 'financial security', a 'better society', etc.<p>You are absolutely correct that much of the technology that has increased productivity has hurt a LOT of people.  And it is very true that our society needs to do something about this situation.<p>And, moreover, if count the cost of the 'safety net' for the people put out of work for the technology, then it may be that, with also the cost of the technology, sometimes there is a net loss in 'productivity'.<p>For another example, Google, Craig's List, etc. are putting out of work a LOT of people in the classified ads departments of newspapers.

So, we need to find better solutions for how to move ahead.<p>Sure, it's too easy to see that too soon we will have to give everyone a basic 'stipend' so that anyone who wants more can work and make much more.  Doing this and keeping a 'productive' society will NOT be easy.<p>Or, what happens when Robots, Inc. makes a robot for $1000 that can do the work of over 90% of the current jobs?<p>Still, the article and I were writing about JUST 'productivity' and not at all about your, justified, concerns about 'quality of life'.",1313961545

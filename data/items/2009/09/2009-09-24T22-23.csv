They can call a hack a hack, and understand it's impact. They know when and <i>how</i> architecture can be improved, and when it <i>should</i> be improved. They can take criticism of their work because odds are, the criticism is something they already had an understanding of and can justify, or if not, they are willing to see where there was a gap in their thinking. They have a plan, and can forge a system ahead in a general direction of progress without getting bogged down in the details or taking one step forward and two steps back. You get the idea.<p>Nobody is talking about this, arguments generally deteriorate where someone sets up a false dichotomy and then the internet collectively rips them apart. But they get ripped apart because of the falseness of the dichotomy, not because of the fact that they are looking at the wrong things altogether.",1253833093

Like I said, I think the talk does a better job making the point than the post; maybe it's just really hard to make this point in a distilled way.<p>I think you and I pretty much agree:<p>1. I think indie developers take security too seriously; they're trying to fit themselves in a culture that's led by banks and investment firms. I think they should pay <i>less</i> attention to people like us.<p>2. I think all developers can learn enough to help themselves when it comes to securing the products, <i>especially</i> if they avoid well-known complicated problems. Custom password storage systems will make you 0 extra dollars; use bcrypt and spend the energy on HTML canvas illustration code, or a more clever backend. Every complicated security problem has 10+ well-known implementations you can and should steal.<p>3. Like it or not, everyone is doing the outreach thing wrong, and everyone can be fuzzing their web apps tomorrow. Note that by recommending that people fuzz their apps, we're arguing <i>against</i> our own best interests. We're saying, ""a key thing people pay us to do, you can DIY.""<p>Having ""Matasano libraries"" to do password storage or crypto seems a lot more smug than telling people to use bcrypt or GPG.",1253832976

Over several years, the maintenance of the tests themselves becomes a huge cost, which is something the TDD guys don't seem to talk about much.  (My turn for an overly-cynical guess:  since many of them are consultants as you've pointed out, they don't hang around with the same code and the same tests for 7 years, so they don't necessarily see how it really plays out).  ""Bad tests"" are actually a huge net negative for development.<p>If the test is testing something (like a getter or setter) with basically no chance of breaking, then it's a waste of time.  If the test is likely to be fragile or non-deterministic, it's a waste of time.  If the test is just too hard to write, and it's not too hard to just test by hand, then automating it is probably a waste of time and you should just QA it by hand every so often.<p>Finding the right balance tends to come back to the old experience and skill thing:  you need to have some intuition about which tests will give you the most value (because that part needs to be rock-solid, or because it's hard to get right, or because it's high-change) and which tests need to be thrown away or never written because they aren't worth it.<p>Taking any development process too far tends to work out poorly, and taking any metric (like test coverage) too seriously is always a bad idea.  That said, I've rarely seen unit testing taken way too far; not testing enough and ending up with buggy, regression-riddled software is a far more common failure mode.",1253831103

However my experience suggests that it is easier to claim social benefits than measure them.  And when you can't reliably measure a benefit, delivery tends to be very inefficient.<p>That isn't to say that government can't meet that bar.  Economic theory says that private enterprise deals poorly with externalities.  It is hard for a private enterprise to recoup the value provided by national defense, police, clean water supplies, public health inspectors, etc.  For that reason it is economically efficient for us to be taxed so that the government will supply us those services.<p>However startups are a case where a person who is good at picking then nurturing entrepreneurs recoups the value from doing it well.  Therefore there is every reason to believe that free enterprise does that job well, and so no reason to believe that the government is likely to do it better.<p>In that situation underinvestment is a signal that the market doesn't believe that the returns are there.

The Azul box is a custom processor specifically designed for the JVM, so it can do things like write barriers around gc in a single hardware instruction.  That, in turn, allows them to produce a fairly pauseless garbage collector:  I believe he claimed something like 10-20ms at most for a 100GB+ heap.  Contrast that to the several second GC pauses you'll often get on a conventional VM with just a few GB of heap.<p>Their boxes are also designed to massively scale up; up to 54 cores per chip and 16 chips in a single box.  I believe they use localized L1-caches, shared L2-caches (between each 9 cores, I think), and uniform memory accesses across all the chips in the box.  The end result is incredibly high memory bandwidth.  The other bit Click talked about was how they can profile under load with basically no overhead, unlike the standard JVMTI interface.<p>They used to sell a lot of gear to financial services companies, as I understand it:  I get the impression that for high-load transaction processing their boxes would pretty much smoke anything remotely resembling a convention server or array of servers.<p>Again, it's a shame the Artima article didn't really talk about any of that.  The fundamental limitations are more primarily in the JVM interaction with conventional x86 chips and the really cool work Azul has done is to create a chip (not unlike the Lisp machine of yore) specifically designed to make the JVM run fast and scale up.",1253829898

But I have the full text of the article at hand, as I am currently attending a weekly journal club with some of the authors, and one key paragraph from the article must be read by anyone who draws conclusions from heritablity figures:<p>""Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008).""<p>This simply reemphasizes a point that is familiar to anyone who has studied genetics carefully, namely that the pre-Mendelian concept of heritability says nothing about malleability, the degree to which a trait can be influenced by environmental variables.<p>Angoff, W. H. (1988). The nature-nurture debate, aptitudes, and group differences. American Psychologist, 43, 713-720.<p>Mange, A. & Mange, E. J. (1990). Genetics: Human Aspects.<p>Kaufman, Alan S. (1990). Assessing Adolescent and Adult Intelligence.<p>So the statement above that heritability somehow constrains the expression of IQ or of consequences of IQ such as occupational success is actually conceptually incorrect. But I appreciate you going to the effort of doing the math.<p>Another thought is that relating one correlation coefficient to another with linear algebra probably depends too heavily on applying linear tools to a not fully linear model. Increases of income are plainly linear and are on a ratio scale. (There is a zero point for income, and each dollar increase in income has the same magnitude anywhere along the scale.) But IQ test standard scores are at best ordinal scales, so it is already an abuse of mathematics to treat them as a linear variable, or to treat a figure derived from them as a linear variable.",1253829742

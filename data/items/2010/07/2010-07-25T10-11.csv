It has more to do with teasing by peers and implicit models enforced by adults than her interests. If she does lose interest then just accept it and hug her while telling her that you'll love her no matter what. Also, spend an equal amount of time with her on stuff that she likes. No matter how far out of your domain it is.

If you get the feeling she's interested in the computational aspect of it, definitely show her python.<p>Another approach would be to code up a simple interactive python script and let her run it. It could be a number guessing game (she tries to guess a randomly generated number, it tells you if your guess is low or high and she has a certain number of tries). Or it could be a mad lib game (she enters a noun, verb, adjective,  etc. and it spits back a funny story/sentence). It depends on the kind of kid she is.

It's mostly screams, accusations and put downs mixed with intermittent periods of affection (I've managed to end the violence). I've been told by my parents that I am not good enough to exist, and I am not worth the money they spend on me. My biological father once made out a huge list of my monthly expenses and gave them to me saying that I wasn't worth it and I might as well get out of the house.<p>I desperately needed an escape, a safe place to go to and the internet gave me just that. It allowed me to connect to different groups of people with different views on life and love. I met a friend of a friend online and she was there for me through a lot of bad nights. If it hadn't been for her I wouldn't be typing this right now. I learnt from people like lionhearted, or my sister and made relationships with some amazing people which I hope will last a lifetime.<p>To an outside observer I am a slave of technology, but is that so? This same medium allows me to learn and self reflect, while staying afloat in the endless sea of emotional chaos.<p>I think that technology by itself isn't the problem. I still read books like anything and I swear by The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann. Whether you use it or abuse it depends upon the type of person you are.

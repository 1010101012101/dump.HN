(Well, there <i>was</i> a robotic wire-wrapping machine that did a lot of the work automatically, and there was another robot that would automatically test the connectivity of all the wires. IIRC, it would take a couple of weeks for the robotic connectivity tester just to test one backplane.)<p>Most of the people involved with designing the Lisp Machines ultimately left MIT, however, to start companies to manufacture and sell them. The most prominent of these was Symbolics. There was also LMI.<p>And yes, Lisp Machines were very expensive personal computers. But computers for ""professionals"" were generally pretty expensive at the time. A timesharing computer that could handle 20 or 30 users could easily cost $1 million.<p>How much did the mouse for a Lisp Machine cost? IIRC, around $250. Economies of scale, and all that.... Yes, Lisp Machines always had mice.<p>Btw, it was the founding of Symbolics and LMI that prompted Richard Stallman to become a free software radical. He stayed at MIT, and spent a lot of his time porting back to MIT's Lisp Machine Lisp the improvements made to it by Symbolics. This is why Stallman came up with the GPL.

5294836,comment,5291600,5292112,1,0,rogerbinns,,,"> Even with one account, you can put all your work-related boards in an organization and keep them separate from your personal boards that way.<p>But that means the credentials, access logs etc of one account are being used for both work and personal data.  If for example the account you use is a work one (using Trello's google account login) then should you leave/be terminated by the company then they will disable/delete that account and now you've lost access to your personal stuff too.  The other way around where work grants your personal account access to the organisation boards severely increases the risk as you'll have your personal account tied to more devices and people than a work account.  For example it wouldn't be unreasonable to let your spouse know your personal account details, or to have your account also set up on one of their devices, or on shared family computers.<p>> I assume Dropbox doesn't allow multiple accounts ...<p>You can actually use multiple accounts - they just don't make it convenient.  You can definitely run multiple instances of the dropbox client providing they are setup to have different home directories.  This is somewhat trivial on Linux and more difficult on the other platforms.  When accessing the dropbox site they have a half hearted attempt at multiple account support, but it is better to login/out and use one account at a time.<p>What they should do is let you enter multiple accounts in the client software.

Part of it is that different communities have different definitions of purely functional.<p>Check me out, I'm about to say a bunch of things as if they're fact, in the hopes that someone will correct me where I'm wrong!<p>So, a few decades ago two groups of people came to the determination that anything calculable can be expressed through a Turing machine or through lambda calculus.<p>The Turing machine was sorta step-by-step and nuts-and-bolts and inspired the imperative branch of programming languages.<p>Lambda calculus is more denotive and inspired functional programming.<p>Now this part is confusing.  Because if you ask ""What language should I learn to explore lambda calculus?"" people will tend to answer Lisp variants.  Whereas if you ask ""What language should I learn to learn functional programming?"" people will tend to answer Haskell.<p>I understand the differences between Haskell and Lisp - Haskell is more restrictive and pure, while Lisp is incredibly supple with its code-is-data-is-code approach - but I thought functional programming came from lambda calculus.  In other words, I don't understand what lambda calculus <i>is</i> that functional programming <i>isn't</i> or vice versa.<p>Anyway, what's generally seen as the most ""purely functional"" language is Haskell.  Opinions vary on how pragmatic a language it is to learn (as judged by job openings and active projects), but it's widely seen as the language to learn if you want to learn and ""get"" functional programming concepts most efficiently.  In other words, learn some Haskell, and it makes other functional languages easier to learn.<p>My basic choice (as an imperative programmer that knows java, perl, php) was whether to learn some kinda java-esque functional language, or Haskell, or a lisp variant (including java-esque lisp like Clojure).  I'm choosing to learn Haskell, and then move over to Scala, since I hear and suspect that is a better way to learn Scala than to go directly to Scala, and since I'm interested in enhancing my existing body of knowledge rather than switching career paths entirely.<p>BTW, there's a third big family of programming language, logical programming languages (Prolog, etc).  I thought I saw that Erlang is influenced by some concepts from that.  So at least in my head, it has seemed like Erlang is the language I'd want to learn if I really wanted to blow my mind with a mixture of functional, concurrency, and logical-programming concepts.",1361997652

As is always the case in law the answer is: ""maybe.""<p>In order to be enforceable certain agreements/contracts MUST be in writing to be enforceable.  It is a contract principle known as ""Statute of Frauds"", but despite the name has absolutely nothing to do with fraud.  Some examples include contracts for the sale of real estate, contracts that will take more than a year to perform, and I think marriage agreements.<p>Although you are most likely correct, the verbal agreement might be enforceable here, but it is certain the Defendant's attorneys will argue the Statute of Frauds applies; therefore, since the agreement is not in writing it is unenforceable.

It's commonplace for an engineer to arrive at a racetrack hours before a race starts, carrying a brand new part. They almost exactly match the ideal use-case for 3d printing - they produce lots of one-off parts, where speed of iteration is vital and money is no object. In reality, most F1 teams use entirely conventional manufacturing processes, even for non-structural components like wind tunnel models.<p>3d printing is extremely useful in a small number of applications (mainly mold-making) but it's not new and it's not revolutionary.

5294553,comment,5293152,5293152,12,0,thebear,,,"Thanks for this post; the importance of Alan Kay's work can hardly be overstated. Here's another quote by him that I find interesting:<p><i>I invented the term Object-Oriented and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind.</i><p>Whether or not you share the disdain for C++ that is implicit in this quote, I believe it is important to understand the difference between the way OO was originally conceived of and the way C++ interprets it. I believe the best way to understand the difference is to look at object-variable binding. Smalltalk and almost every other OO language that followed it uses <i>reference semantics</i>: the assignment<p>x = y<p>causes the variable x to release its binding to whatever object it is currently referring to, and to refer to the object that y is referring to instead. C++, on the other hand, is pretty much the only OO language that uses <i>value semantics</i>: the intended meaning of the assignment<p>x = y<p>is to copy the state of the object to which y is referring over to the object to which x is referring. The older and wiser I get the more I am inclined to believe that this attempt to marry OO and value semantics was an experiment that has failed. Even if you do not believe this, you'd have to admit that the collective amount of time and effort that the C++ community has spent on dealing with the assignment operator is simply staggering. (I would have made that last statement even two years ago, and now we have rvalue refereces.)",1361995712

There are a lot of people out there that might be far better entrepreneurs than you, but because they weren't born into a situation that gave them a good education and the ability to take a risk, they never will.<p>Nobody is born into a situation that ~20 years later destine them to run a startup.<p>The type of person who takes charge of their life, also takes charge of their education, you cannot learn some of the skills it takes to be a self made person.<p>Risk appetite isn't something predetermined at birth, and it isn't learned from someones environment. You can develop the ability to take risk from surrounding yourself with successful people, just as easily as you develop it from having nothing left to lose, and realizing how much you've been overestimating your worst case scenarios.<p>> Running a startup is stressful, but don't try to pretend that there aren't enormous upsides. You can do whatever you want, you can work with whomever you want.<p>If what you want to do is work and focus on success, then you can do whatever you want, but there are plenty of moments where you will want to be doing something else. This is called self-discipline, its just like the discipline normal people are subjected to, if you ignore it, you lose your job, or your startup fails.<p>> How many other people in the world can do that?<p>Not as many as I would like. There are organizations like Kiva that aim to give those less fortunate an opportunity, and hopefully more pop up that make it even easier.<p>> The guy earning minimum wage in his factory job, spending all his salary just to keep out of poverty- if he fails, he is fired, and he and his family are screwed. He is the person whose face is much more likely to be covered in actual dust and sweat and blood.<p>He can also get another factory job. Try failing a startup and just starting another, its going to be a lot harder than pounding the pavement and submitting resumes.<p>> Being in this industry is a position of extreme privilege. Harping on about it as if it's a heavy burden to bear is utter nonsense and only helps the perception of ""startup folk"" as deeply out of tune with how the rest of the world works.<p>Anyone harping on it as a burden has the wrong attitude, and frankly I would be surprised if they lasted.<p>It is definitely not extreme privilege. These companies don't just start themselves and adopt whoever has the winning ticket. You have to have a good idea, and you have to be willing to act on it.<p>Many people have good ideas, and could grow a successful business out of their idea, but they have the wrong ideas about what is stopping them, so they never try. These people come from the same communities as any startup founder. The difference is a founder dares to challenge the beliefs that have been crammed down their throat, even if everyone around  them insists its a bad idea.",1361995264

5294519,comment,5293960,5293960,0,0,danso,,,"Anything that boosts the profile of the humble spreadsheet gets a thumbs up from me. I almost always start taking notes with a spreadsheet. It may be something as simple as two fields: one for the actual note and two for a category. If it's trivial to add a timestamp, I'll do that too.<p>The notes end up being far more organized than as if I had just put them chronologically into an empty text editor (though in a pinch, I may just write my notes in a tab delimited format and import them into a spreadsheet). Even if I never need to chronologically reverse sort or sort by category.<p>More importantly, when doing a research project, it serves as a checklist for what I need to do. Awhile back I wanted to track homicides in my city and so I started off with just name of victim, name of suspect, age, time of day, link to a news article, time of arrest, address, etc. Without a spreadsheet, you'd forget at least one of those details as you did your research in the traditional note taking fashion.<p>And when you make your model more complex: i.e. realize that you need to record time of arrest, charges filed, age of suspect, etc., the spreadsheet makes it easy to backtrack and fill your past data rows.<p>And when you realize you need to make your data model more complicated: the fact that a number of suspects could be implicated and charged for a single homicide, and face various charges, you are all ready to have your ""notes"" be put into a database.<p>And now that it's in a database, it's just a weekend of hacking to make a homicides website or a map.",1361995236

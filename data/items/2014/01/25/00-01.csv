With Instagram, you spend a lot of time taking the right photo, the right lighting, the right filter, the right caption, etc. All of this is gone with Snapchat, because you know it&#x27;ll be gone. People are happy to share slightly embarrassing stuff, like a mouthful of burger or no makeup.<p>Selecting who receives is easier, too, because you can uncheck some people.

Anyone that has worked on a long running system can attest to that; well defined data structures and table layouts will outlive any application code.<p>When I&#x27;m designing a system, I think I spend orders of magnitude more time thinking about data structures then actually implementing the CREATE/ALTER TABLE code for them.

I&#x27;m not even 100% sure I&#x27;d recommend it to a younger version of myself, although I&#x27;m also not sure I&#x27;d recommend <i>against</i> it either.<p>Basically, I&#x27;m single and childless, and darn close to my every free minute goes into the startup project.  When I was working full-time, that meant &quot;after work&quot; M-F and the majority of my Sat and Sun. hours.  I make an exception during football season to watch the Dolphins game on Sunday (yeah, yeah, go ahead, say it... I&#x27;m a glutton for punishment).<p>I force myself to take a break every once in a while and read a novel or watch a movie or something... but truth be told, lately, even when I watch movies or something, there&#x27;s an angle related to the startup.  For example, I&#x27;ve been reading and studying a lot about sales lately, and I&#x27;ve seen more than one sales book mention &quot;be like Columbo&quot;.<p>I had kinda wanted to rewatch some old Columbo episodes anyway (yeah, I&#x27;m old, deal with it) so I&#x27;ve been watching Columbo and thinking about &quot;how do you apply his attitude / approach to this &#x27;diagnostic business development&#x27; thing&quot;?  And the movies I make time for tend to be ones that I find inspirational (Rocky, The Karate Kid, Rad, etc.) that help keep me motivated.<p>About 6 months ago, I dropped down from full-time status to part-time status at my regular job to free up more time for the startup.  I had a little bit of money saved, but not enough to quit outright... luckily the owner of the company was willing to be flexible and let me do that.  I&#x27;ve pretty much burned through my savings though, and we aren&#x27;t profitable yet, so I&#x27;m going back to working full-time next month.<p>These days I forgo most social activities like dating, parties, and most non-technical social events.  I rarely mountain bike anymore, and almost never set foot in the gym.  I bailed on going home to see my parents for Christmas so I could use those few days of &quot;down time&quot; as recovery time.  I stay amped up on more caffeine than could possibly be healthy, and do everything I can to the tune of heavy-metal[1] or hard-rock of some sort.  My mantra right now is &quot;Caffeine, heavy-metal and adrenaline&quot;.  \\m/<p>I know, I know... you&#x27;re thinking &quot;dude, you must be miserable&quot;.  Nah... I <i>enjoy</i> this in a certain sense, and since I&#x27;m 40 now, and haven&#x27;t achieved anything yet, my mindset now is to say &quot;fuck it&quot; and go for broke.

7119145,comment,7118117,7119029,1,0,craigkerstiens,,,"> The biggest hangup other than the UX issues the author talks about is the fear of having to manually shard your data. There are a lot of promises about automatically sharding your data from NoSQL vendors but I have no idea if they actually are able to deliver on this. If you are just doing a K-V store, then of course sharding is easy, regardless of the database you are using. I don&#x27;t think there is really a silver bullet here, just maybe better tooling and removing redundant manual steps. You still need to think carefully about data access paths and queries and so on. Any additional sharding-centric features of NoSQL databases missing in mainstream databases could presumably be added, if they don&#x27;t exist already with poor UX.<p>Original author here. Yes this is definitely another real hangup, though I semi-intentionally left this one out as magical sharding is still a bit unclear of how well it works depending on who you talk to.<p>> For example PostgreSQL replication, wal log archiving, etc works great but it&#x27;s still a bit tougher to set up than the more magical cluster auto discovery/configuration/sync stuff you see in things like elasticsearch. It would be interesting if the PostgreSQL people made a real push for a release to tighten up the operational UX of the product to be more human friendly instead of adding on more core features. (Not that I&#x27;m complaining, it&#x27;s great!)<p>A big plus one on all this as well, and we&#x27;re doing what we can to push it forward.",1390608873

You will have to fix it yourself.<p>If you depend on some other service, you are subject to their uptime and disaster recovery capabilities. Nobody is better than Google at either of these things.<p>But to your point, it probably is a good idea anyways to have offline backups of your critical data, and to have out-of-band fallbacks for critical communication in the event your primary channels have an interruption.",1390608106

If you type &quot;Nudel&quot;, which is German for noodle, into the Google search box, you won&#x27;t get auto-complete entries presumably because it contains the word &quot;nude&quot;. This happens even on the German Google version (?hl=de).<p>Interestingly, it seems that Bing does a better job of separating &quot;Nudel&quot; and &quot;nude&quot; as it does offer appropriate auto-complete entries. I&#x27;m not sure how widespread this problem is and how Google and Bing compare on other search terms, though, since I only randomly stumbled upon this issue while searching for recipes.",1390608089

321802,comment,321558,321558,0,0,m0digital,,,"Ruby and Python are both great choices like everyone has said. However be warned!  It may make you quit your enterprise software job.  Once you move to a dynamic language you will become increasingly frustrated with the inadequacies of the Java language.  Eventually you'll want to work with Ruby/Python/etc so much that it will make you quit your job....and move on to something, possibly, better. :)",1222963021
321801,comment,321585,321756,0,0,DabAsteroid,,,"<i>I think most people would assume a man of his accomplishments would certainly be more than ""not much smarter"" than alot of people today are.</i><p>Einstein is commonly claimed to have had a +4 sigma g-strength (IQ of 160, on typical scales). Even assuming a normal curve, rather than the more-popularly-believed fat-tails curve, that would leave millions of people today with higher g-strengths than Einstein had.<p><pre><code>  .\n</code></pre>\nArthur Jensen writes:<p>Creativity <i>and</i> genius <i>are unrelated to g except that a person's level of</i> g <i>acts as a threshold variable below which socially significant forms of creativity are highly improbable. This</i> g <i>threshold is probably at least one standard deviation above the mean level of g in the general population. Besides the traits that Galton though necessary for ""eminence"" (viz., high ability, zeal, and persistence),</i> genius <i>implies outstanding creativity as well. Thouhj such exceptional creativity is conspicuously lacking in the vast majority of people who have a high IQ, it is probably impossible to find any creative geniuses with low IQ's. In other words, high ability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the emergence of socially siginificant creativity. Genius itself should not be confused with merely high IQ, which is what we generally mean by the term ""gifted"" (which also applies to special talents such as music and art). True creativity involves more than just high ability. It is still uncertain what this is, but the most interesting theory I have seen spelled out in detail is Eysenck's. He hypothesizes that the essential personality factor in creative genius is what he terms</i> trait psychoticism, <i>which has a genetic basis and is explainanble in part in terms of brain chemistry and physiology.</i> (The g Factor. Ch14, The g Nexus. pp577-578.)<p>This is Eysenck's book:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=eysenck+genius"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=eysenck+genius</a>",1222963014

No need to go into details, but we tried lots of productivity software out there. We didn't like them. Too complicated. Too ugly. Or it took too much effort to put in new todos or a planning. So we went back to notepad, and that didn't work either. Notepad doesn't scale for teams.<p>So, as a side-project, we started working on a todo and planning app for internal use. It made a huge difference for us, because we can now see exactly who's doing what. Fewer meetings are necessary and life is good again. And if we like the web app, there must be others who like it too. So here we are.<p>We put together a screencast on our blog, to show you how it works. Is this something you would use? Something you might pay for? Any feedback is welcome!<p>Link: http://stunf.com/blog/<p>Thanks!",1222962988

321796,story,,,6,7,antirez,"Ask YC: Feedback about one of our service, LLOOGG",,"Something like one year ago I wrote http://lloogg.com in few days. It started like an hack to have a ""web 2.0 tail -f access.log"" but then I started to add features and wrote a little ""PRO"" account with adsense tracking, a bigger history, and so on. The result was an invite-only real time traffic analysis tool with something like 1200 users currently.<p>The problem was that we lack a solid business model, so after one year the service is provided in a best effort way. When we did it one year ago the feedback were ""It is cool"", but now the question is: is LLOOGG still something we could try to invest on? Or it's just plain better to sell it to interested companies here in Italy (there are a few) for not too much money?<p>Your feedback will be appreciated.

Unless you are running the AI off the GPU.  Getting that to work well can be as simple as separating a complex evaluation of each node across a different CPU.  It's not going to be 4x as fast on 4 CPU's but there would still be a significant boost. Or with multiple AI's just give each of them a core and move on.<p>Now if your talking about 10,000 node clusters it becomes a much harder problem but efficiently doing most things on a huge cluster is hard.",1228424263

It's very social, fun and develops your body in ways few other hobbies can. There are rock gyms in most densely populated areas I believe.<p>Plus there's less of a tendency for awkward, quiet moments as you get a break from eye-to-eye contact when you're actually climbing.",1228421732

But the way you worded it, you dropped the college degree reference many times.<p>I don't want to sound like a cynnical person when writing on this.  I think it's cool that you published your results, I just felt like pointing out that it seemed like a lot of emphasis was put on college degrees as a qualifying factor.  I would really like to hear about your reasoning for why you selected the applicants in the final round.<p>Some possible things to consider writing about next time:<p>Did they contribute to open source projects?  If so, which ones?<p>Did they write some cool apps in the past?  If so, what were they?<p>Do they have an interesting philosophy on life, code, or hackers?  If so, what was it?",1228421573

In the case of the mortgage bubble, the interest of the financial industry employees--to make the maximum short-term profit for themselves and preserve their jobs--directly conflicts with the interests of the investors whose funds they are managing.  The same thing happens in companies in other industries, where the short-term interests of the managers to produce quarterly results conflicts with the long-term interests of shareholders and the interests of their customers.  This also happens on a small-scale, when a small business owner or entrepreneur hires their first employee, because the interest of an owner and a salaried worker are rarely aligned.  In these situations, everyone can be rationally pursuing their personal self-interest based on the incentives presented to then, but it ultimately leads to a worse outcome for everyone involved.  I wonder if there are any ways to work around these situations, whether they occur in a small business, a large enterprise, or the economy as a whole.",1228421385

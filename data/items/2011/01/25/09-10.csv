This stuff is unimportant. If a person needs your software, all that stuff will not deter him from trying it. If I need some deployment software and your text is a bit gaudy, I'm not going to abort the download.<p>I've been selling software at your pricepoint for 5 years and more. If you want to sell, follow these rules:<p>- Design of your website don't matter<p>- Add a price-list request form and remove the price<p>- Get into a real and genuine conversation with each person who requests your pricelist<p>- Answer emails within 30 minutes and be very helpful<p>- Make sure there is no competition with exactly the same featureset who is cheaper<p>- Use affiliates and people who are selling similar stuff. Get into partnerships with them<p>- Make sure you have your website listed in all download sites possible. They will rank higher than your actual site typically<p>- Make sure your software works perfectly, has an easy install and does not require any additional installs and does not crash<p>- Capture the email addresses of your potential customers and email them<p>People want software that works well, is at a reasonable price and that has a human behind them, when they buy at those prices. All the other stuff is really secondary.",1295949598

I have a property in Brisbane that has been vacant for 3 weeks in the last 10 years.  It is highly unusual for it to be vacant between tenancies.<p>The reasons are varied, but increased planning laws and high immigration means that the supply of city properties is not keeping up with demand.<p>And yes, home ownership is very big in Australia.",1295949585

The others are just arguments which have to be arguments in order for the resources to work. Which leads to...<p>Keeping the Redis names means REST isn't even an option. There's no way around that. For instance LINDEX and LSET operate on the same resource, i.e. the same URL.

2138587,comment,2133922,2133922,0,0,razzaj,,,"I face the same problem. I think it is a ""business owner/entrepreneurial"" syndrome (if not chronic disease). The shear number of ""stupid"" (according to our entrepreneurial mindset) tasks that are necessary to accomplish is often discouraging and a turnoff.<p>My method of getting over this syndrome is made of a few simple steps:<p>- make myself unavailable for some time (could be a couple of hours or 2 days). And if this is not possible resort to waking up at odd times like 4:30 or 5:00 AM where you have no chance of being disturbed.<p>- I get started by picking the easiest tasks and doing them almost mindlessly. That helps in making you feel good about yourself (i think the fact of achieving tasks must release some ""feel good"" hormone/chemical in ones brain, i call it the ""good job candy"") and once you start getting a taste of the good job candy : you effectively start building momentum.<p>- Once you build momentum you are usually good for going through the entire list, because having started with the easiest tasks, each next one you complete yields a higher dose of good job candy and thus more drive to dig into the harder tasks.<p>That being said, an even better (in the sense of it's efficiency) motivator is the near disaster situation during which i suspect most of us become supper efficient.",1295949332
2138586,comment,2138206,2138499,0,0,acangiano,,,"A few thoughts:<p>* AdSense is commonly known as blogger welfare. There are a few people making huge money from it, but they use techniques you would probably never want to adopt (content farms, keyword arbitrage, etc...). Generally speaking, you use AdSense to supplement your main monetization strategy that should be something better.<p>* Boxes, like the one criticized in the article, tend to convert very well.<p>* Programmers are the worst demographic to monetize, particularly with ads, and even worse with the often not-so-contextual ads from AdSense.<p>* ProgrammingZen and Math-Blog used to receive similar amounts of traffic when I used to have ads on both. I make 4 figures a year from AdSense ads placed on Math-Blog. ProgrammingZen on the other hand generated a few dollars a month at best, much like your experience. Keep in mind that Math-Blog is still fairly technical, so I wouldn't discount AdSense a priori, but the less technical the better (in general).<p>* Having a programming or very technical blog I'd suggest that you try to monetize/support it through affiliate links to reputable merchants like Amazon. I make 4 figures a month from the Amazon Associates program alone (albeit not from ProgrammingZen alone, of course).",1295949276
2138585,comment,2138450,2138465,0,0,nika,,,"You point out that most of RIAA's positions prevailed as a matter of law as an argument against representing them being a breach of professional ethics.<p>I think that these are two different contexts. I don't like the term ""ethics"" so I'll use the word ""morality"".  There is a difference between something being moral and something being legal.  For an extreme example, everything done in tyrannical states, such as north korea or iran are ""legal"" because they are done under the laws of that country. That does not mean they are moral.<p>A lawyer who defends a reprehensible or immoral character in order to defend a moral legal principle is to be respected.<p>But I'm not sure this is the case here. (and I'n not saying it is not the case either.)<p>My point is to note the confluence of legality with ethics/morals and to point out that they are not the same, and thus one cannot support the existence of the other.  That a law exists does not make breaking it immoral, nor does the lack of a law prohibiting something make the act therefore moral.",1295949260

I assure you, had Bush made this pick it would be lampooned as being too corporate etc etc etc.<p>I understand that people want to give lawyers the benefit of the doubt and not judge them by who they represent, but honestly, I find that logic appalling. Would we really be saying that for a lawyer who defended the Catholic church in the sex abuse scandal? No, b/c anyone with _any_ integrity would likely walk away from that...or anyone with any political smarts. Same in this case. It seems clear this man is not about ideals or principles but rather money and privilege. Is that who we want in arguably one of the most important non-supreme court law positions in the country?<p>Even if he _is_ about that, he hasn't proven it with his judgement by taking those cases.

Tunisia has its own certificate authority[1] and since 2007 the root certificate has been included in Microsoft Internet Explorer[2].  This certificate is not included in common other browsers like Safari or Firefox.  If you visit [1] from one of those browsers you will see a certificate error.<p>Microsoft has been helping government like Tunisia repress its people because they do not audit these government controlled certificate authorities and they do not restrict the TLDs that the certificate can sign.<p>In Microsoft Root Certificate Program there is a special exception for Government entities[3].  So any government can certify to Microsoft that it is trustworthy with a simple statement:<p>""Increasingly national and regional governments are establishing Certification Authorities intended primarily for government to government or citizen to government (e-government) transactions. These government CAs may be actual government entities, or private parties operating according to a government Certification Practice Statement (“CPS”). Government CAs must meet all the General and Technical Requirements for inclusion in the Program with the exception of audit. Microsoft may accept the following audit equivalency from government CAs.<p>Audit equivalency – for government CAs who issue certificates to secure government to government or citizen to government transactions, Microsoft will accept a statement from a government or private party auditor attesting to the CA’s audit status, giving the name of and reference to their audit guidelines, the date of the last audit, and equivalence of their audit criteria to the Operating Standards (e.g. WebTrust For CAs, ETSI TS 102 042, ETSI 101 456, ISO 21188).""<p>The certificate used by government of Tunisia is not restricted to .TN domains.

These are not in the Tunisia certificate and Microsoft does not require this.  So, Tunisia certificate can sign .com domains and so a man-in-the-middle attack like in UAE[5] is possible in Tunisia.  It would be easy for Tunisian government to be intercepting SSL connections to Facebook etc.  See that Mozilla is thinking about such a restriction for root certificates[6].<p>Bottom line: Tunisia could claim to be Facebook if user is using Internet Explorer.  So could any other government.  Microsoft currently has certificates from China, Isreal, Turkey, HK, Macao[7] in the browser.  Also new certificates can be added any time.  Do no use Internet Explorer if you live in a country with a government you donot trust.<p>Also Microsoft turns blind eye to what government's do.  Why does Microsoft allow these certificates, but Safari, Chrome, Firefox do not.

Typically these languages are supersets of general purpose languages like c. That is, they are c code with additional annotations (OpenMP) or use annotations with some initialization API (GPU languages). On top of that, there are purely array based general purpose languages (APL, J, K, NESL, etc).<p><i>""it's very hard to take a program in a language such as C#, where mutation is interspersed throughout the code, and parallelise it automatically.""</i><p>I agree with qualifications. It's not so much the mutation that is fault, but the over specification of dependence. For example, map() makes clear that the iteration is data parallel. It is trivial to convert map() to pmap(). for() does not say anything about the iteration being data parallel, so to convert this to par() the compiler must do an analysis. Depending on the program this may require an alias analysis. While this may be possible, and perhaps even easy for common cases, to do so in general requires quite complex analysis.<p>In any case, I think it's perfectly possible to create a parallel mutable language. In fact, the agent model readily encapsulates mutability in a parallel and distributed way.  So while I agree with the critique in the context of C#, I don't agree with how the author generalizes it to the topic of languages as a whole.",1295948458

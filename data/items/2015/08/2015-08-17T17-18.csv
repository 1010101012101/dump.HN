If you don&#x27;t believe me, do a price check on cloud hosting and then keep in mind that cloud hosting must be profitable so the prices you&#x27;re seeing have some non-trivial margin attached.<p>Software development isn&#x27;t free. Sure, OSS developers can donate their time, but there&#x27;s a selection process that comes into play.<p>OSS developers do what they do partly because they enjoy it, and so they tend to gravitate to the types of development that is <i>fun</i>. Fun stuff includes deep systems stuff, algorithms, distributed systems, the flashier aspects of UI/UX, machine learning, etc.<p>Fixing stupid bugs that stem from stupid compatibility issues and adding stupid features for stupid use cases is not fun. Debugging edge cases that afflict 1% of your users occasionally is not fun. Porting to popular but crap platforms is not fun. Supporting legacy platforms and APIs is not fun, nor is maintaining backward compatibility. Accessibility features and translations are not fun. Supporting right-to-left language is not fun. Rewriting your entire already-working app to support the next web fad (e.g. &quot;responsive mobile design&quot;) is not fun.<p>I could go on forever. There is a <i>really really really</i> long tail of these horrors.<p>This is why OSS rules in the systems/algorithms/etc. space but drools when you get close to the user. This is why every major <i>end user</i> OS, site, or platform is commercial. <i>People have to be paid to torture themselves with that stuff.</i><p>Yet these sorts of problems are precisely the ones that make the difference between something only geeks (with time on their hands) would want to use and something regular people who aren&#x27;t computer experts would want to use (or computer experts without time on their hands).<p>For a distributed, decentralized system to challenge the silos of the web, it would absolutely need funding. Eliminating hardware and bandwidth costs is easy; eliminating HR costs is not.<p>There will never be a volunteer-developed mainstream platform for the same reason there are no volunteer-developed mainstream anything elses. To make a truly polished product of any kind requires <i>pain</i>.<p>Disclosure: I currently run a distributed networking / SDN startup. The core technology has been up and running for years with few modifications. It started as a side project so I haven&#x27;t kept careful account, but I&#x27;d easily estimate that upwards of 90% of the development time spent on this project has been on trying to get it to the point that it can install and run trouble-free on multiple platforms and is easy enough for mere mortals to use. Getting the core plumbing, crypto, etc. working was the most fun and the most intellectually challenging, but it was a huge minority of time spent. Had there been no chance of a commercial application I would have stopped there and it&#x27;d be yet another piece of interesting GitHub networking orphanware, because <i>for the love of God who would voluntarily try to port such a thing to Windows?!?</i> let alone Android (It&#x27;s in C, so enjoy your JNI pain).",1439834262

I&#x27;ve done it, I know others who have done it, there are people who make their livelihood helping others do it.<p>On the other hand, the problem with calorie counting is that most people only do it for a very short time, because it sucks.  It&#x27;s totally unsustainable for most people because they don&#x27;t have the time or aren&#x27;t willing to change their lifestyle to include hours per day spent focusing on nutrition.  So they lose some weight over the course of several months, then let their nutrition lapse and gain it all back in a few weeks.

I also like the idea pf SMS as a channel input device for using such apps.<p>The line of thinking seems to be: Africa and Asia leapfrogged the desktop / laptop generation of computing and directly went for mobile. The younger generation in the Western world essentially is mobile-first. Apart from work (and even that might change for many job descriptions in the future) even most people in traditionally first-world countries don&#x27;t even use desktop computers anymore. Hence, what we see in Africa and Asia right now essentially also is the future for Western countries.<p>In general, I think this is spot on. However, I also think many people get overly excited by the promises and possibilities of messaging apps. SMS-based apps in particular often are makeshift solutions for when there&#x27;s no reliable Internet connectivity all the time but somewhat reliable cellular coverage.<p>The bus information example is a particularly good example of this. Sure, it&#x27;s useful but many of the improvements mentioned in the article like linking to a specific resource for a specific bus line for easier future use can already be implemented today in websites. There&#x27;s no reason why I couldn&#x27;t use a mobile browser instead of a message app for accessing this kind of information. The problem is that most websites - public transport websites being a particularly notorious example - often are terrible from a UX point of view: User interfaces are needlessly complex and often barely usable at all.<p>Perhaps, the takeaway from this article also is that when designing websites and web-based UX we can learn a lot from the simpler interactions on mobile devices. Good design is all about embracing constraints. Perhaps applying those constraints from mobile messaging to designing websites is a good idea, too.",1439834076

in conflict with US laws and the US
Constitution.<p>In the case of the OP, a relevant rule is,
a poor, old, handicapped, black man is
not permitted to be on the sidewalks of
the high rent business district.<p>In such a case, the police respond as in the
OP and its video clip.<p>The <i>sentence</i> for violating the rule is
to be pinned down, painfully, insulted,
humiliated, have some belongings, e.g.,
crutches, stolen, and generally treated
like dirt.<p>But, with witnesses, smartphone video,
and lawyers, the black man may no longer
be poor but may get $500,000 from the
city of San Francisco.  If I were
on the jury, he&#x27;d win, big time, big
enough to make all of SF taxpayers
feel the pain.<p>The whole scene was in wild violation of the
US Constitution.  The police are 
guilty as sin, of assault and battery, at least.
Toss in false arrest.  Add in theft of his
crutches.  And more.  He was guilty of what?
Self defense against assault and battery?
If he died, and maybe his health was so
poor he might have, e.g., he might have
had a heart condition or 
high blood pressure which could yield
a fatal stroke,
then the police would
be guilty of murder -- literally murder.
And they should be prosecuted for just that.<p>Better not ask me to serve on
a jury where that poor guy was
the plaintiff -- I&#x27;d call for
the cops to be treated like
wild, mad, rabid dogs, enemies
of the citizens, making war on the
citizens, sadists.<p>The situation is entirely similar
to what the Nazi Brown Shirts did
in Hitler&#x27;s Germany:  In that country,
some citizens were regarded as unwanted.
Then, via the Brown Shirt thugs, those
citizens were subject to just whatever,
robbery, beatings, murder.  Now 
in SF, some citizens are again regarded
as unwanted, and the police act like
the Nazi Brown Shirts and
rob, beat, and, maybe, murder such
citizens.  Not much difference.<p>It&#x27;s inhumanity of man to man, and it&#x27;s
ugly.  We&#x27;ve seen the consequences from
Hitler, Stalin, Saddam, ISIS, and more.
We don&#x27;t like it.  We have our Constitution
to help stop it.  We don&#x27;t want it.<p>One really good use of smartphones, their
video capabilities, the Internet, social
media, and the US legal system is, finally,
to stop this ugly stuff.<p>Police:  Here&#x27;s your lesson.  Here in the
US, that stuff&#x27;s going to stop.
It&#x27;s going to stop the easy way or the
hard way.  I have to believe you want
the hard way, and it&#x27;s coming.
Net, the power in the US is definitely
not in the hands of the police and,
instead, is in the hands of the
voting citizens.  And, each such story,
with video, on the Internet creates
a lot of votes to stop the ugly stuff,
via the hard way if necessary. 
Cops will be going to jail,
for assault and battery, murder,
etc., for long terms but likely
in prison conditions where they
won&#x27;t last even six months.
Blue shirts, you&#x27;re going to have to
stop that Nazi stuff, however much
it pains you not to be a thug --
you can&#x27;t beat the voting
citizens with video cameras.  Can&#x27;t
happen.<p>All we have to do is quietly, 
calmly, privately pull a lever
in a voting booth, and you and your
Nazi behavior are toast.",1439833790

Python also has a single distribution network: The Python Package Index (aka PyPI / &quot;the cheeseshop&quot;).<p>* Talking about distutils/setuptools/distribute is the same as talking about many of the tools that are used to manage Perl packages/modules (I can&#x27;t recall their names off the top of my head, but there are at least 2 or 3 of them, and they all generate their own Makefiles/etc for doing things).

What does the borrow checker have to do with actor libraries?<p>Are you implying that these actor libraries give you the data race freedom guarantees that Rust&#x27;s mutability rules give you? If so, that&#x27;s trivially false. Those libraries guide you toward patterns that eliminate data races in simple cases if you follow them, but nothing enforces the rules. Moreover, being forced into actors or message passing for concurrency severely restricts the expressiveness of your program. Rust&#x27;s approach lets you use shared memory if you like, or message passing if you like, or a combination of the two, with <i>enforcement</i> of the rules no matter which you pick.<p>> So far the Rust tricks with unsafe for certain data structures (e.g. double linked lists/DAGs) seem like fighting with the borrow checker. Or the issues to be solved with upcoming 1.3 changes for pattern matching.<p>Yes, they&#x27;re tough. This is a downside of manual memory management (though one that can be improved in future iterations).

To perform the sort, you grab the spaghetti in a bundle and place it on a table so the bottom of each spaghetti strand is on the table. Then you put your other hand on top, find the longest strand, and pull it out. Repeat this process once for each strand, and you then have all the numbers in order.<p>This is described as a &quot;linear time&quot; algorithm because you perform the same procedure once per number, so it&#x27;s clearly O(n). It&#x27;s obviously impractical for real-world use, but if you had some utterly ridiculous quantity of numbers, maybe it could be the best way!<p>But of course this ignores important factors. For example, the radius of the bundle will increase with the square root of the number of strands present within it. Whatever you use to select and retrieve the longest strand must move at some finite speed to traverse this distance, which means that the actual running time is O(n^1.5), substantially worse than the theoretical O(n log n) limit!<p>Another factor that is often ignored is the fact that analog systems don&#x27;t actually have infinite precision. If you look at their actual (or even theoretical) precision and convert that to bits, it&#x27;s not all that many! Lots of analog solutions can look extremely clever and quick, until you realize that it&#x27;s just solving the problem for a 28-bit number, or whatever.",1439833069

The small number of people in western countries adopting vegetarian diets is not to blame for these things.

I think singling out vegetarians is pretty unfair, even if it was mentioned in the paper.<p>Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve been a vegetarian since I was seven years old, and I make pretty much no effort to make sure I get the &quot;right&quot; amount of nutrients. I simply don&#x27;t eat junk, and based on what I&#x27;ve read about nutrients I should supposedly be deficient in (B12, zinc, iron, etc.), I have never suffered from any of the symptoms associated with deficiency.<p>* Technically, lacto-ovo vegetarian, although eggs only come in the form of occasional junk food (e.g. cakes and brownies), and dairy comes from the very rare occurrence of eating out.

That leaves a lot of options open. We run a rather complex .NET application on CentOS using mono without any isssues. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that most newer programmers don&#x27;t learn C#. You may be able to find people easily that are good with it, but they are likely to be older and more expensive.

For example, think about how complicated character sets were to deal with before Unicode. Then compare the mess of different kinds of Unicode encodings to standardizing on UTF-8. Or take file formats before XML/JSON/Protobufs. Or, going further back, floating point before IEEE 754.<p>I agree that blowing it all up is not a win, which is why accidental complexity goes away only gradually, and it&#x27;s partially a process of hiding it rather than removing it, with lots of politics along the way.",1439832551

The city tree across the street had gotten large enough in the last 10 years to start shadowing some of my panels. So when the arborists were in our neighborhood I pointed it out, and they cut a chunk off the top of the city tree so that it would stop doing that.<p>At one level this was &quot;fine&quot; in the sense they were totally ok with that and felt they were obligated under California law to do so.

It&#x27;s far too easy to go overboard eating plates of spaghetti and meatballs than it is grilled-chicken atop salad. After I lost weight and cleaned up my diet, I now perfer the latter to the former. When my diet is consistently clean, it&#x27;s easier to maintain the cleanliness. There&#x27;s a lot of inertia when it comes to eating and controlling the velocity is far more valuable than just changing the speed.",1439831709

Eventually she had to switch to giving messages to a human holding a letter board by looking towards them for &#x27;yes&#x27; and away for &#x27;no&#x27;--cameras or Hawking&#x27;s infrared-laser-based system weren&#x27;t really feasible.<p>We looked at some software called EZ Keys from a company called Words Plus. (I don&#x27;t think she used it specifically, at least for long--I know she used another program, a DOS-based one called Living Better that ran in 40-col. mode that I can&#x27;t anything about on the Internet.) EZ keys looked more or less like Intel&#x27;s thing -- scan rows, scan items in a row, completions/predictions over at left. It even had an option to use a frequency-sorted keyboard like the Intel one, with the common letters pushed to the top left (since those are the first rows/cols to be scanned). Hawking apparently used EZ Keys, so it&#x27;s possible the Intel folks intentionally gave their thing a similar interface to make the transition easy.<p>It is worth remembering that no user cares if it&#x27;s WinForms or whatever. Some folks might like a nicer voice if they haven&#x27;t gotten used to theirs like Hawking ;), but the main concern is just getting the message across.

The infrared-laser-based input method sounds cool, too.<p>This is a neat space: an optimization/prediction problem where improvements can be a significant help to someone.

It didn&#x27;t care about chimneys or skylights (which are easily visible through Google maps), nor SF fire code which states that you need a 3-foot empty pathway on both sides of the crest of your roof [1].  So for almost every roof with a single ridge, this will cut out a large percentage of the best solar real estate.<p>2) It didn&#x27;t include local SF providers in the marketplace which are generally higher rated than national providers and can offer additional SF incentives and cost-savings.<p>So while the estimation of sunlight potential is really cool, the 3d modeling aspect and size of the marketplace leave a little bit to be desired.  This site would probably be good at quickly seeing if your roof has any solar potential at all, but if it does, I&#x27;d recommend checking Yelp and having a highly-rated solar company come give you a detailed estimate (which would be free).<p>1: <a href=""http://www.sf-fire.org/index.aspx?page=1232"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sf-fire.org/index.aspx?page=1232</a>",1439831248

No, it can&#x27;t.

94443,comment,94389,94389,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I got one during the G1G1 deal, and it's really nice...but everytime I fire it up, I have a few wishes:<p>1. More RAM
2. Faster (I don't think the hardware is to blame...I think the Python-focused UI is just not efficient enough for a 400MHz 256MB system)
3. More storage<p>I've fixed the 3rd, and the 1st partially, by adding a class 6 SD card, and assigning 1GB to swap and 7GB to storage.  So, I can do real work on it now...including running Firefox 3.0b2.  I'm a few minutes away from having it converted to running xmonad for the window manager, and expect it to be much more usable (for my needs) at that point.<p>The limitations of the default ""Sugar"" software are striking, for someone that has a pretty ingrained sense of how to use a UNIX system (I've been nearly exclusively a Linux/UNIX user for over 10 years...when I use a Mac or Windows box, I'm constantly hitting middle mouse button expecting something good to happen...like pasting the last thing I highlighted).  In Sugar, Copy/Paste works in a very clunky and slow manner, even worse than Mac OS X or Windows, and doesn't work at all in the terminal application.<p>So, what the heck am I rambling for?  I guess to say that I would be among the first to buy an upgraded OLPC that is slightly faster, runs a more standard Linux installation, and has more storage and memory.  Even if it cost a little more than the G1G1 $400 price point.  A bigger screen would be sweet, too.",1199331620

94435,comment,94348,94409,0,0,raju,,,"innernode: Thanks for the response. I too was thinking of the 17"" Pro, though I have to admit, plunking down $3000 for a laptop hurts a bit. Not to say I would not do it, but it just so happened that a friend of mine picked up the 13"" Mac Book a few weeks ago, and although he does not spend a lot of time at home moonlighting, he says he loves it, and it would work for development purposes. Needless to say I was a little apprehensive, and figured this would be a good time to post the question.<p>I fully intend to use an external monitor anytime I am at my desk, so it was not the screen size that worried me a lot, rather it was performance, and the nagging feeling that the Mac Book was not designed keeping developers in mind.<p>Though again, thanks for the review. Every day I get closer to owning a Mac, and moving full time (atleast while working at home) on it. Hopefully ""closer"" is not too far away...",1199329726
94434,comment,94288,94315,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Yeah, it seems pretty stupid that such an amazingly effective change it treatment would warrant this kind of negative reaction from the government. If a hospital changes the way doctors write up their charts to make previous treatment more visible, is that considered a ""drug trial"" like this?<p>Regardless, unlike testing drugs on people without their consent, using a checklist or other types of charting has practically zero chance of causing death.<p>The OHRP's response is asinine.",1199329640

717543,comment,717167,717484,0,0,kragen,,,"There are lots of places where people refer to the kinds of comments that show up on web message boards as, well, far from the epitome of rational, polite, interesting discussion. Maybe discussions on email mailing lists are the most common place where this happens.<p>I think a lot of us here are users both of Reddit and Hacker News, and that experience is why we don't want Hacker News to turn into Reddit. It's not that we're belittling Reddit's <i>users</i>, but that we don't like the kinds of discussions that occur on Reddit.<p>The comment at the top of this thread is a perfect example: instead of contributing to the discussion, its author thought it would be more worthwhile to express his disagreement with the subject of the article by using the word ""fucking"", without ever actually explaining why he disagreed. He succeeded in writing a funny comment (it got ten upvotes!) but not in writing anything worth reading.",1248248465

He wanted to help people, but getting paid for it seemed dishonest—how real was help that demanded recompense?""<p>Looking at his blog, it sounds like he still does that kind of thing, doesn't it? He wouldn't have to work many shifts to compensate for the resources he draws from the rest of society. Also, he writes things that other people enjoy reading, which has traditionally been considered productive work, and he's presumably performing some kind of minimal service just by diminishing the waste stream.<p>So I don't think it's quite true that he's contributing nothing to society.<p>You write, ""Articles about guys like this make me kind of angry."" Well, that's not surprising. His value system is clearly very different from yours, and anger is a normal human reaction when you're confronted with someone behaving according to a different value system. It takes a lot of maturity to get past that point.",1248247496

I set up my phone this way and if it doesn't work as planned I'll post the outcome. Also, if anyone is ahead of me on this please weigh in.<p>Many T-Mobile plans allow 5 numbers with unlimited incoming/outgoing minutes, they call this feature ""My-Faves"".. Program one of those 5 with your GoogleVoice number and then use that for all outgoing calls. And of course give any new people you meet the GV number instead of your original cellular number. Then switch to an appropriate lower priced calling plan.<p>Now if using GV's SMS doesn't rack up my alloted T-mobile text allowance I will be even happier!",1248246491

1325086,comment,1324825,1324825,0,0,arghnoname,,,"I'm not going to address your specific questions (I lack the proper experience), but I'll question an assumption.<p>I once worked on a project where the main developer was fired after 3 _years_ of failing to get the product out the door. There was a lot of code, and it was colossally bad. Worse than anything I had ever seen on The Daily WTF. I and another developer that were put on this project to take it over begged and pleaded that it just had to be rewritten.<p>We were denied. They didn't know how bad it was, surely. We tried going over heards. We made presentations. We e-mailed around particularly egregious examples, but this was a codebase where the total awful was greater than the sum of the individual horrors, so to speak.<p>Anyway, over three years this guy, bad as he was, must have worked hard. There was lots of it and we were just expected to 'fix it' since it was 'almost done.' Nevermind that nothing worked. Slowly, steadily, whenever we'd go to fix a bug we would (in stealth) rewrite whatever section we were in. Eventually we started writing adapters to help the new cleaned up code communicate with the bad, bizarre, inconceivable horrors or API design that the old code had. Eventually, like replacing the handle of an axe on one occasion and the head on another, we had a whole new code base that we had come to be proud of.<p>The lesson I took away from this is it's sort of limitless what this kind of refactoring can accomplish, even if it's not the most enjoyable way to go about fixing a mess. With something like your situation, it's how I'd recommend going about fixing it, since these sorts of things are hard to understand in the aggregate anyway.<p>Most bugs in any piece of software are concentrated in relatively small proportions of the code. Start there and you might be able to launch with much of his code intact, with the most damaging removed or repaired, and fix the rest in transit.<p>Or not. You know your situation better than I possibly could, but it's something to think about.",1273169784

We've found that most people's blog titles will <i>not</i> fit into 25 characters. In fact, we've seen blogs where truncating the action link after 25 characters leads to some unfortunate text.

At the Federal level, the cable and satellite companies got the original anti-circumvention laws that led to the DMCA.  They also get to be exempt from a lot of state level regulation that they might not like, in exchange for the far friendlier FCC.  And at the local level, telcos get to use public rights of way and often have monopoly grants.<p>They're in no way comparable to a small entrepreneur.  They're like a company that's been given (or bought) permission to operate a toll road.  In exchange for being allowed to make money, they need to charge everyone the same tolls and the amount of the tolls that they charge is going to be subject to regulation.<p>As for why the government doesn't just build and operate the infrastructure itself ... if the telcos keep it up, that may just be what happens.  Critical infrastructure has been a frequent target, historically, for nationalization when the owners of that infrastructure are perceived to be rent-seeking to excess.  The public tolerance for toll roads evaporated in the 1880s [1] and they were almost entirely stamped out by the Progressives; the telecommunication operators of today would do well to keep that in mind.<p>[1] <a href=""http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Klein.Majewski.Turnpikes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Klein.Majewski.Turnpikes</a>",1273169128

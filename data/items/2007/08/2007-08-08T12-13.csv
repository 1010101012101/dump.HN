It's not a heavy management role: there'd just be one network guy working for me.  I love coding more than just about anything... but this looks like it'd be more of an analysis and knowledge management thing.  I'm probably going to take it because it's the only way ""up"" in my current situation... but will I have killed my chances for becoming a hard-core heads-down code-cutting developer in the process?",1186577826

What are we, communists? <p>Didn't you get the memo, Mr. Schlender? Communists are so last century. The bad guys of this centry are terrorists, not communists.",1186575509

What you get out of it is connections and access to some of the best minds in the industry who have been there and done that (though of course, I am not speaking from experience here) to help you at the critical early stages of your venture, which will end up being immeasurably more valuable in the end.",1186575463

He describes his career as following a ""roadmap between a serial entrepreneur and investor"". He's especially interested in micro investments such as those offered by US company Y Combinator: small packets of cash for very early start-ups in return for a stake in the business. The start-up's principals are also brought into Y Combinator for some intensive training in how to be a successful entrepreneur. Described by some as a sort of ""Idol for geeks"" where talents can be spotted, moulded and developed, Mr Leeb-du Toit believes there's merit in the approach, and is exploring whether something similar might work well in Australia. ...""</i><p>Above is the quote that caught my attention.

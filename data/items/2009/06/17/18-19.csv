Thanks for pointing that out. Then what other replies said about ""journalism"" would apply to that submission.<p>After edit: what I don't see readily by digging around on the Harvard Business.org site is how much editorial input goes into a blog post before it is posted. There plainly is editorial work invested in presenting the blogs in a common online format and serving up how they are ordered on the main blog page. I'm less sure what manuscript editing happens to submitted blog posts.",1245265028
662277,comment,662203,662203,0,0,davetufts,,,"While that 2002 is probably Krugman's most blatant call for a housing ""bubble"". Mises.org just compiled a list of 7 other pre-2002 Krugman calls for lowering interest to stimulate home buying: <a href=""http://blog.mises.org/archives/010153.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mises.org/archives/010153.asp</a><p>Like another commenter on this page states, Krugman didn't think a housing bubble was a good idea...but it was necessary to avoid a recession. Still, why not just deal with the consequences of the dot-com bubble then? Inflating another market just kicked the recession down the road and made it worse.<p>Unfortunately, Krugman and most politicians think we can fix the housing bubble by creating a currency bubble. Instead of focusing on a single market like housing, the current plan is to, yet again, kick the recession down the road. This time, however, we're promoting spending across all government-controlled and regulated markets with massive stimulus. Obviously, creates a bubble of dollars. When the dollar bubble deflates, there won't be anything left to blow up.",1245265005

His primary argument is that unexpected/catastrophic events (like the 1987 crash, the Dot-com crash and the 2008 crash) are far more common that most people think. A cool $10M to $30M every decade or so? Not bad in my book. How is your portfolio looking these days? Similar? I didn't think so.""<p>An investment strategy, like that described in Taleb's first book, Fooled by Randomness, that costs real money year by year for several years but then pays off hugely at a sudden moment, has just the characteristics of an insurance policy with generous policy benefits. That's a smart way to invest. By contrast, investing to gain small amounts of real money year by year followed by a catastrophic loss larger than the original investment is a bad way to invest. But that's what a lot of leveraged ""hedge fund"" (wrong name, really) investors were doing before the recent crash.",1245264924

If you read the article, Krugman isn't saying that a housing bubble is a good idea at all. What he's saying, in essence, is that the only way to avoid a recession (again, this was in 2002) was for Greenspan and the Fed to kick off a housing bubble to sustain consumer spending.  And, by implication, that that was unlikely to work.<p>As it happened, he was wrong about that.  We did experience a housing bubble (although one driven more by irresponsible bank behavior than by interest rates), and it did keep consumer spending high for the next 4-5 years.  And, now that it's popped, we're experiencing the recession that Krugman predicted.  He was just off by a few years, and missed one proximate cause.",1245263892

That's what is (now) confusing to me given your replies to my original comment. My original criticism isn't of compass. It's just that if I don't like blueprint/YUI/960, then would it not be redundant to use compass?<p>Hopefully you don't take this personally. If I ever find myself required to use one of the above frameworks, they would probably be a lot more palatable when used in conjunction with compass.",1245261996

This would retain the notion of Foo being a type much better than transmogrifying a function into a class. (Granted, there's not that big a difference technically but you're tricking other programmers into believing Foo cannot be used for eg. isinstance.)<p><pre><code>  class Foo(Struct):\n    __endian__ = Struct.LE\n    foo = Struct.uint32\n    bar = Struct.string(foo)\n</code></pre>\nIf you don't like specifying the endianness as a class attribute you could still inherit from Struct.LE/BE rather than Struct itself.<p>Quick technical howto: make Struct have a __metaclass__ class attribute, populate the __metaclass__ class with a __new__ or __init__ method performing the desired transformations.<p>See <a href=""http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2/descrintro/#metaclasses"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2/descrintro/#meta...</a> for details on metaclasses.",1245261928

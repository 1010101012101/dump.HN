Their long term strategy is all about content, or pages with aggregated content/links that help people find the content they need.  It's actually a great idea, instead of relying on Google's algorithm 100% to serve the right results, Mahalo is employing people to aggregate the content.",1234961309

Yes, it is still effective, but it is much less effective now than it was when it was launched.<p>Pagerank turned out to be the death knell to the value of linking to someone, it created an opportunity to be gamed so large that it changed the nature of the object (the internet) that it was supposed to be measuring.<p>A good measuring device does not 'load' the circuit to the point that it stops to function...",1234959527

485649,comment,485626,485643,0,0,jacquesm,,,"yes, there is the necessity angle, that's true. But still, I think it holds for the most part, if you ask people if they would pay for a free service then that's absolutely content-free.<p>Something like facebook or twitter <i>needs</i> to be free in order to succeed, just like air <i>needs</i> to be free for you to live. Asking if someone would pay for air, facebook or twitter is a meaningless question, if you need it and you can only get it by paying for it then that's what you'll do, but in the case of facebook or twitter a free alternative would spring up overnight and run with your userbase.",1234959013

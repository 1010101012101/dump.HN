But then...&quot;</i><p><i>(cut to Jeremy in the Roadster, a musical cue cutting off the soundtrack, signalling a problem.  Jeremy pumps his foot, looks down at his foot and back up with a perplexed look on his face, and says &quot;Oh&quot;, with backround noise of the Tesla decelerating.</i><p><i>Jump to outside view of the Roadster rolling to a stop in the middle of the track, with Jeremy narrating &quot;Although Tesla say it will do two hundred miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles.&quot;  During this the scene changes to men pushing the Roadster in a hanger.</i><p><i>More narration from Jeremy, &quot;And if it does run out, it&#x27;s not a quick job to charge it up again.&quot;</i><p>Make of that what you will, I don&#x27;t think words do it justice, which is why I included the video[0].  The narration is accurate, but the portrayal clearly implies something more than the narration, making it very to misconstrue what the facts are.  The facts are, by the way, that the Roadster never ran out of power, they ran it for a few hours, decided they didn&#x27;t want to wait for it to run out, and staged that portion.<p>Now, Top Gear is clearly an entertainment and comedy program, but to act like that&#x27;s the end of it is also clearly ignoring the reality of the situation.  Top Gear is less like SNL than The Daily Show or The Colbert Report.  Viewers expect it to not be too serious, but right or wrong, they also expect to be able to get some information from the show, knowing that they&#x27;ll need to sort through the context to determine whether it was a joke or not.<p>Keeping all that in mind, to me Top Gear seems to have overstepped slightly here.  Then Tesla overreacted with a lawsuit.  That&#x27;s why I said neither seems to have come off well.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/electric-shocker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.topgear.com/uk/videos/electric-shocker</a>, start at 4:17 for the relevant scene.",1378522715

First, note that using aspects of functional programming doesn&#x27;t immediately necessitate you do nothing but functional programming and use nothing but &quot;functional&quot; languages.<p>Consider a piece of poorly refactored C++ spaghetti you&#x27;ve been tasked with understanding.  The same variables mean different things at different times... code assuming vectors have the appropriate length, then later normalizing them in place, and then later yet changing their direction... state being repeatedly accumulated and adjusted in different branches... how do you start cleaning this code up to understand it?<p>One of the first things in my hat is to start using a more functional style.  I sprinkle around the const keyword on local variables like a madman, helping catch all code with side effects to local temporaries.  Variables are split in twain, with vectors and their normalized versions being forced to have different labels.  But therein lies the advantage:  I no longer have to track &quot;x means y except after z when it means y2&quot;, but can drastically simplify to &quot;x means y&quot; -- something I can usually encode in the variable name, easing pressure on my feeble memory.  Moreover, since the constants stick around, I can paint a better picture of &quot;before and after&quot; much more quickly than through the pinhole of stepping (usually in one direction only) through more procedural code, simply by slapping a breakpoint at the end.<p>While I&#x27;m still not using nor desiring to use functional <i>languages</i> as my bread and butter, integrating functional <i>styles</i> into otherwise procedural code quite frequently helps save my time and sanity outright, even on those occasions when it feels stilted and unnatural compared to the procedural versions.",1378520007

If I&#x27;m working in a compiled and typed language, the <i>last</i> thing I want is a language that automatically gives union types to variables.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the type inference should fail at this point.

This is true even if the &#x27;player&#x27; (with system access) has to be &#x27;recruited&#x27; by the attacking or defending team some time after taking up the job.<p>Couple this with the fact that even the security agencies themselves are prone to corruption, malfeasance, human error, (no-one is perfect), and insiders, and you could easily end up with a confusing mess.  Bear in mind that everyone wants their agents to operate and be able to communicate back without detection, again regardless of which team.<p>Compartmentalization must also come into conflict with inter-agency sharing rules -- at some level, people need to know what is going on and make decisions -- and trust must be a big issue for many of these groups - they probably spend a ton of time watching themselves and others, and watching for information leaks / canaries / spread of misinformation.<p>I&#x27;m certain there&#x27;ll be some fascinating stories eventually from all of this - it all continues to make me believe that concentration of power and information (which I think are continuing as a trend) only end up in creating dangerous situations, and that decentralization is ultimately the preferable way to go (in that it prevents a small number of people from having too much power/influence/control, and equally protects those same people from being targets themselves).",1378519216

Prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles resulting from an ancestral symbiotic relationship.<p>(You might be able to found some weird exception to the rule out here. This is a generalization -- nothing in biology shocks me anymore.)<p>Even for unicellular eukaryotes, it would be incorrect to claim they&#x27;re separate organisms from their membrane-bound organelles just because of the organelle&#x27;s evolutionary origin.<p>Unicellular organisms really are &quot;unitary.&quot;<p>Edit: A biologist should always be humble.

Within the context of Y Combinator it probably makes a lot of sense, but on Hacker News, it draws a bit of a circle around insiders and outsiders. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intentional, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly constructive either.<p>Not knowing what &quot;PG&quot; means can be taken at face value. People can still write amazing comments and submit great news items without knowing or caring who &quot;PG&quot; signifies.<p>I think you make a fair point. Hacker News is constantly growing and Paul Graham has been less active for many months and since Sam Altman became the public face of Y Combinator, Graham has been less visible and the ability to recognize all the Ycombinator partners by Hacker News user name isn&#x27;t particularly valuable.",1447703971

I was taught OCaml in college, along with C, Java, C++, and Prolog.<p>Ocaml was easier than even <i>Java</i>.  Much less demanding than the minefield that is C++.  And it certainly doesn&#x27;t require more education.  A <i>different</i> education, that&#x27;s for sure, but not more.<p>As for requiring a stronger understanding of math… Languages like OCaml just don&#x27;t pretend that programming is not math.  So it tends to scare away those who fled math in the first place.  C++ and Java are just as mathy (if not more, just see the sheer size of the specifications), but they don&#x27;t really tell you.<p><Grumpy Dijkstra> Programming should have been of the applied mathematics department, not the electronic engineering one. </Grumpy Dijkstra>",1447703917

I was trying to say something about human psychology.  We can admit that it is silly, but we can&#x27;t pretend that it doesn&#x27;t exist.  This may be a bigger deal than they realize.<p>Programming languages are used primarily by humans, which means they must be designed with human psychology in mind.  Today, Julia would have (even) more community support if not for this seemingly inconsequential decision.  The fact that it seems to be succeeding anyway is largely in spite of, not because of, this design choice.",1447703906

He was more akin to a king sending peasants to die.<p>It is a fact though that lower economical areas have more crime and less opportunity.  It would be harder to recruit the foot soldiers. It will always be the plebs that have the power to continue or end it, and one way they might choose to end it is because they have a comfortable life.<p>Look at Brazil, the inequality there, on the lower end human life means nothing.  In conditions like that crime, terror, desperation will make people do anything to survive.<p>While I agree this ideology is different, most strong ideologies arise out of a lack of economic options.<p>If suddenly your house got bombed, members of your family died, and you lost the ability to survive economically, you&#x27;d probably survive however you can even if that means blowing something up for money for your family. People aren&#x27;t born suicide bombers or terrorists, the environment around them forms that.<p>I am simply saying one known way to win hearts and minds is to help economically and give options to people susceptible to it.  I am not saying poor people are terrorists, I am saying terrorism (or at least desperation crime) can grow in lower economical areas for recruiting more easily, and the only way to combat that is with better economics and opportunity. The same happens in inner cities with gangs, high unemployment etc. [1][2]<p><i>Equally decisive in determining crime rates are the more invisible barriers to crime set up by social norms and social cohesion.

No sane person, not even the most die-hard anti-statist anarchist, wants to live in a world where something like the Paris attacks go unpunished.<p>But, after Snowden, we&#x27;ve observed that scaling the surveillance power of the state doesn&#x27;t apparently lead to greater security, only the desire for greater and greater power. How many credible terrorist attacks have actually been foiled by the apparent global panopticon the world has been living under? The truth is, we don&#x27;t really know, and the answer is probably n > 0, but there are obvious cases where the system has failed, despite that.<p>The implication hidden in questions like this is that the latest attacks could only have been prevented if governments had <i>more</i> surveillance power, more control over autonomy, more ability to project arbitrary force around the world, regardless of sovereignty. Yet no amount of power will allow a government to be right in preventing crime 100% of the time, it&#x27;s impossible. Even if systems like Tor and cryptocurrencies allow some criminal activity to thrive (and are arguably intended to do so,) it&#x27;s better for the sake of free society and civil liberty to have the state be half-blind than all-seeing.<p>I don&#x27;t know what a proper balance looks like, but I am certain it&#x27;s weighted too far on the side of government power as it is. We should continue working to interfere with and to reduce the surveillance powers of governments, support pervasive encryption, and to oppose greater collaboration between government agencies, particularly across national lines. Doing otherwise only further legitimizes the violations of human rights that have already come with global surveillance, rendition camps, drone strikes against civilians, etc. The actual threat from terrorism throughout much of the Western world doesn&#x27;t appear to be commensurate to the degree of power that the governments of the world are demanding to be able to fight it.",1447703199

But now you once again have scientists doing science, and if those scientists confirm the other findings, then they might also have used biased methods, so you once again have to either trust them, or not. So to build trust, yet more scientists have to collect and analyze yet more data. But what if <i>those</i> scientists are also in on the bias? So maybe at this point, you hire your own scientists that you trust implicitly because you&#x27;re the one paying them. Maybe their findings contradict all the earlier findings, and so you trust that. But now nobody <i>else</i> trusts their findings, because you paid them for the study, so people think they are probably biased toward your perspective. This is literally what has been going on for years.<p>So now what? How do you collect and analyze data when trust in those doing the collection and analysis is not a given?<p>One approach is to implicitly trust scientists, because they are experts in their field, while you are a novice. This is what a lot of us do, and I think it&#x27;s a perfectly fine solution, but it is a trade-off; you might misplace your trust.<p>Another approach is to train up on the science yourself, so that you can independently verify things. This is a great solution, but it isn&#x27;t scalable. Most people have other jobs and other interests, and in any case, you can never be an expert in <i>everything</i> that matters.<p>Another approach might be to try to build trust using out-of-band signals, like transparent communication. Transparency often sounds nice, but it also has a major chilling effect, because people communicate more efficiently in the sorts of candid conversations that are hard to have publicly.<p>Personally, I think the witch hunt for biased climate scientists is disgusting and beside the point, but I also find it distasteful to suggest that it isn&#x27;t a really hard problem to disseminate trusted information about complex subjects in a highly specialized society.",1447702693

Maybe there&#x27;s that uncle you&#x27;re just not that comfortable with to begin with, or your neighbour who always lightens you up somehow. But the problem is that focusing on thoughts and modelling your impression by thinking masks these feelings off. Thus, most people don&#x27;t realize how their feelings change when they move from place to place and from person to person. The feelings can be seen in your body language but in the worst case you&#x27;re completely oblivious to them yourself. Typically you just grow a blurred sense of anxiety or ease, much like a moving average of what you&#x27;ve felt that day.<p>Now imagine you do get a slight grasp of all that, and begin to practice it. Maybe you can find a way to &quot;feel&quot; different people, maybe you observe how your feeling changes when stepping into an elevator with different people each time. Maybe you find some other way to sift through people and try to get a feeling from each one. There are infinite number of ways to practices and they are all equally hard.<p>Sensing can be really hard because, today, everyone is always going, talking, making noise, and acting busy. It&#x27;s impossible to deal with a lot and try to get a feel of a person at the same time. I think something similar was described in the article: you need to be out of the focus, you have to have some space around you to make this connection with your feelings. However, for some reason, your body tends to like breathing. Focusing on breathing tends to tone down the active parts of brain and emphasize your sensibility to your feelings going through your body. Maybe that is the reason martial arts emphasize breathing a lot. So, it might be that you find yourself breathing slowly and steadily in the elevator, maybe gazing out to the wall during the ride, and just practice sensing what the feeling is each time, with different people.<p>The more you practice, the better you get. Usually, as with practice, there are turning points where you just suddenly &quot;get it&quot;, or at least you will get a glimpse of it if nothing else. Maybe at some point you begin to associate these feelings with an idea, or rather, an intuition. This is where you learn to put meaning in the feelings. A lot of times these feelings tend to be unexplainable. You don&#x27;t know how, but your answer is &quot;no&quot;. Or &quot;yes&quot;. Or whatever you were seeking to know. In fact, the surefire sign that the feeling produces a genuine intuition in you is that you can&#x27;t make yourself explain it. You&#x27;re still practicing but now you need to practice trust. You get readings, some of which are noise from your mind and some are signals, from your body and based on genuine feelings, and you need to learn to trust your judgement on which one you heard.<p>Becoming more sensible is not a game. You can&#x27;t game it: what you need to do is surrender. Also note that it is absolutely not a one-way street. By changing how you perceive your surroundings and the people out there also changes you. You will not be the same person who is asking about this and who eventually gets the answer. It&#x27;s also nothing mystical nor magical, it&#x27;s just something humans can do but very rarely choose to do by a conscious choice.<p>Foot note: I&#x27;ve been a very sensitive person since I was kid. So has my wife. It seems all so normal here now. Many a years back, it was truly comforting to realize that there are others like me. I&#x27;ve chosen to increase my sensitivity during the early adulthood by relying more on it. What you use will get bigger, I guess it&#x27;s like what a muscle would do. It&#x27;s also not a general trait or objective capability: it&#x27;s very personal. What and how I feel the world is completely different from how Jessica Livingstone feels the world. Or my wife. Or anyone else. But the truths I feel myself are only applicable in my own life, so that is fine.",1447702220

There should be more acknowledgement of the art produced on both sides of this divide, and more crossing the aisle (so-to-speak) from the thought leaders in this debate. Of course we need to train our next generation to work with these machines, and of course we should not kick the traditional liberal arts out of the curriculum. Sheesh.

Few of them will be prepared to commit to a new programming paradigm when there are so many other employment opportunities which use more familiar frameworks and develop skills more widely applicable in the job market.<p>I&#x27;d also like to suggest that, for certain applications, the most touted benefit of functional programming (the ease of proving algorithms behave as intended) is not especially relevant.

It&#x27;s pretty clear that there&#x27;s <i>something</i> more than that going on.<p>Otherwise a whole lot of things that make Lisp interesting don&#x27;t make a lot of sense. Where does the meta-programming come from if it&#x27;s all just lists? How can it not be horribly inefficient if it&#x27;s <i>really</i> just lists?

But without a personal motivation of &quot;I read everywhere that this thing is so powerful, and I&#x27;m going to find out why&quot;, then indeed I can imagine how &quot;everything is a list&quot; can be a toxic thing to teach about Lisp, in particular to a class of students who are busy enough that they just want to pass the course. What if they forget most, except that bit?<p>[0] except for me, Lisp wasn&#x27;t one of those. We got Haskell though. Except it came at a rather inopportune moment, switching curricula, had to tag along last moment with some friends for the assignments, crammed for the exam, somehow passed and promptly forgot what monads are again. boo, hiss. yes.

Negative swap spreads do NOT imply that big banks are more creditworthy than the US Treasury.  That is obviously fallacious.  You are comparing apples and oranges.  If you want to do a fair comparison, compare the yield on a Treasury bond with the yield on a non-callable bank bond of the same maturity.  Guess what?  The Treasury yield will be lower.  Or if you prefer, look at the CDS market and compare the CDS spread for protection on the US Government vs the spread for any major bank.  Again, the US government spread is less.<p>If you want to understand this, you need to think about what kind of arbitrage trade would profit from this situation and why it&#x27;s not happening in large enough size to reverse this.

If you were and 18 year old Iraqi in 2003 and planned to go to college, maybe to become a developer or doctor, where are your dreams now? If you survived, maybe you are now a 30 year old former militia member with a high school education, without skills or prospects in a sea of economic and political desolation.

It contains direct instructions that are such. The Sunnah describes the violent actions of the violent person claiming to be prophet of the god (which was invented earlier) and his followers. The Old Testament describes the actions of the violent god (an invented being by his believers) and his believers trying to win and control the Canaan territories. The New Testament describes the violent action of authorities who try to keep the order by crucifying the person claiming to be the prophet that brings the end of the world, then contains a lot of briefs of his followers and then one apocalyptic vision.<p>And not a single one of these texts holds any scientific truth. All are based on myths and superstition.<p>At the time of the &quot;last revelations&quot; already 800 years passed since Greeks measured the circumference of Earth, the size and distance of Moon and the size and distance of Sun. But the supposed god of the supposed prophet instead spends the energy to leave the message that the uncle of the supposed prophet will burn in hell. He cares about the priorities, you see. In the Old Testament the god actually comes through the house door to his favorite believer and shares a meal with him. Or strolls through the garden. You know, gods have to eat too. Oh, and god also has rest for one day after making the whole world in six.<p>Read them all and compare.",1447700930

Teams should be about having complete and total trust in the other members of the team, and the feeling of ""where all in this together"" is what pushes the team to succeed.<p>If you're worried about your ability to show leadership body language, you could start by making a conscious effort to make eye contact with you talk to for the duration of the conversation. This will be uncomfortable, but will force you to push your bounds of how you act and give you confidence to make other changes.<p>After that, watch Deep Space Nine and mimic everything Sisko does :)",1365037023

5490301,comment,5487316,5490215,1,0,latchkey,,,"Visibility is one part of the problem. 50k requests/min is only ~833/s. The reality is that a single dyno should be able to more than handle that sort of load, especially if it is a simple app. People are doing 10k connections on a single laptop, 833s should be a piece of cake. So, yes, visibility is a big issue here because you have no idea if you need 10, 11, 12 or 20 dyno's to serve 50k requests/min. You just guess and when you guess wrong, it ends up with cascading failure of H12's and other issues. Never mind that very few apps have a steady stream of traffic and most have big dips depending on the time of day and HN popularity... and now we are back to the auto scaling discussion.<p>Another key part of your statement is 'with very little variation'. The code pretty much can't be doing anything other than serving up some static content because as soon as anything that requires any sort of IO or cpu will instantly throw the system into H12 hell. Yes, a CDN will take load off your Heroku dyno's because god forbid that your dyno actually do anything itself. Except that you forget that not all apps are webapps and in my case, there is no reason to add a CDN when I'm just serving requests and responses to an iphone app.<p>The other part of the problem is being able to actually do something about it. I've tried anywhere between 50 and 300 dynos (yes we got that number increased). If we could just throw money at the problem that would be one thing, but nothing was able to resolve the H12's that we see and our paid support contract was no help either.<p>""If you're running a blog that serves 600 rpm / 10 reqs/sec off of two dynos, you don't need to sweat it.""<p>Once again, we are back at the same conclusion... don't use Heroku if you want to run a production system.",1365036903

Because I swim in the middle of this moral compass. Something like: ""wonder what got under his skin, sorry about the scene, there, guys;"" bam, I just got the table back on my side and now <i>you're</i> the idiot.

Leadership and control has everything to do with <i>clear</i> communication, not necessarily aggressive communication. Aggressive communication makes people leave. Leadership is communicating your vision and finding agreement, and only overruling them if you've discussed the issue at hand but can't find agreement.<p>You might consider looking for a technical co-founder. Someone you'll give something like 30% equity to, but no salary.<p>On to another issue:<p><i>You need to launch.</i> Think about how this sounds from an investor's point of view: ""I've worked on this project for several years alone. I think there are customers for it, but I've never launched it so I don't know if there are actually any customers for it. I'm running out of money..."" I would not invest. You will have a lot of trouble finding investment. And if you do find investment, it will probably be on extremely unfavorable terms (giving up control, usually), because the investor will know/sense that you are desperate for the money (in order to have leverage in a negotiation, you have to be in a situation where the other party wants the deal <i>equally or more</i> than you want the deal). The attitude of ""I've done the heavy lifting, and that's a bad thing?"" is the wrong attitude, because heavy lifting is useless if it doesn't accomplish anything: as far as the investor knows, all the heavy lifting is useless and won't ever generate money.<p>There are two reasons an investor will invest: 1) They believe in YOU, or 2) They believe in the product. You can fulfill criteria #1 by having social proof that demonstrates your brilliance (i.e. Harvard PhD, famous researcher), having a strong team with you of experienced programmers, or having experience starting profitable companies. Criteria #2 is NOT solved by having a great idea; it is only solved by having growth (users or revenue, doesn't matter as long as there is tangible growth).",1365036242

They said no.<p>At that point, our choices were to do a hostile fork of Chromium into the WebKit tree, write our own process model, or live with being single-process forever.

It pains me to describe them this way, because I was friends with many kids like that in high school, but that's what they were: Naive kids who never tried to learn anything on their own or even figure out if the field was something they would actually enjoy working in, but instead held onto a fragile dream while playing video games and masturbating, truly believing that they could just sit on their asses for years and wait for a university or ""game design school"" to turn them into talented in-demand professional.

I don't see anyone advocating that langauge patterns commonly used by hillbillies/rednecks be considered a completely different language, but those people are not just poor and uneducated, but also white. It seems that compassion runs dry so quickly for people of the wrong race, whichever one has been deemed fashionable to mock in a particular culture/decade.

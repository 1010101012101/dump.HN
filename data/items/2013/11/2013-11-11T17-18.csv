Postgres scales nearly as well as Mongo while being a lot more flexible. That said, Mongo has some real benefits for non-relational computing (see mapreduce) that could make some of the abstraction headaches and lack of data model flexibility worth it for very large data sets.<p>But I sort of agree; Mongo tends to be overused by startups who are trying to solve a scalability / performance problem before they have one. In the process they often end up running into data model limitations because stuff moves fast early on and you can&#x27;t foresee what you&#x27;ll need in a year.",1384192755

I&#x27;ve found it to be too stupid to even address this, even though I assume that a &quot;non-trivial&quot; amount of development time is wasted because of it.<p>As a perfectionist I&#x27;m more often than not engaged in rewriting code &quot;the right way&quot;. Generally I&#x27;ve found it hard to accept that there are so many ways of doing things. Worse, some solutions perform better while others are easier to read. Even worse, there&#x27;s usually a trade-off between those two.<p>To address this I&#x27;ve came up with two ideas. The first would be a language that would be ultra-restrictive, so that there could be only a limited number of ways of doing things. However my guess is that this has been tried and failed.<p>The other idea would involve some clever IDE and/or version control system, that would allow different versions of constructs to co-exist. In other words there would be different &quot;views&quot; on any piece of code. In fact, this is already the case with documentation which can be seen as a &quot;natural language&quot; view on the code.<p>This would solve the &quot;The Narcissism of Small Code Differences&quot;-dilemma, as every programmer could keep his favourite version. But what&#x27;s more interesting: Based on the assumption that rewriting code for ideological reasons is common behaviour that can&#x27;t just be stopped, it would be nice (and more efficient) if the rewritten code could at least serve some other purpose. As different versions of a function exist, they could be invoked based on some criteria (probabilistic or as a fallback) with the intent of increasing fault-tolerance.<p>Of course having a fallback is part of the motivation for version control systems, but these are not able to utilize different versions in a systematic way/at runtime, at least not as far as I know.",1384191021

With the few plans I glanced at for 2.0, it doesn&#x27;t look so much like a price drop as it does a storage capacity and max connections drop.<p>Production plans used to allow 1TB of storage and 500 connections.  Now the smallest production plan has dropped to 64GB of storage and 60 connections.<p>I know Heroku is trying to run a business, and that computing resources do cost money -- but that copy seems a bit misleading to me.<p>Customer email blast:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
As someone who is already using a Heroku Postgres production database were excited to ensure youre the first to know about our new release, Heroku Postgres 2.0. This new release continues to build on many of the great features you may already take advantage of as well as a price drop across certain plans. This new release highlights:<p>Built-in alerts around what you should do for your database, bringing a new level of operational expertise built right into the product.
The ability to rollback your database to a specific point in time, similar to how you can rollback bad deploys on Heroku
New tiers, with our premium and enterprise tiers including high availability with automatic failover
You can read more details about the features included within this release on our blog post.<p>You will be able to continue using your existing plans. While they will not appear in the addons:list you will be able to visit the legacy pricing page and they will continue working. We will notify you before any changes do occur to existing plans.<p>Cheers,
The Heroku Postgres team

- risk of corruption of a single archives will make all further increments worthless.<p>These are very important things to consider when doing a backup.<p>Currently, you have to limit the chain length by performing a full backup every N increments (with N being as short as possible), which defeats the purpose of efficient increments.<p>I have requested the ability to specify manually the ancestor of the increments (by time or count), so that one could implement a non-linear hierarchy with multiple levels like one normally does with tar/timestamps, but the request was dubbed as &quot;unnecessary given the delta efficiency&quot; (despite the fact that efficiency is just one variable). Having a 3 level backup (daily, weekly, monthly) would make duplicity much more space efficient, reduce the number of full backups needed, and shorten the chains to the level that would make restores of &quot;last year&quot; actually _possible_.<p>I sent several patches to fix duplicity behavior with files larger than 1gb (by limiting block counts), which got integrated, but are still a far cry to make duplicity work decently as a whole-system backup&restore solution. It&#x27;s just too slow. And like you said, several bugs afflicted duplicity in the past that would make restore fail in many circumstances. I also debugged my share of issues, which led me to think that very few people actually tried to restore from arbitrary increments with duplicity and/or used them to archive a large system.<p>Many got fixed, but I won&#x27;t consider duplicity again until I can control the incremental ancestor and reduce the chain lengths (and it&#x27;s silly to think that &quot;rdiffdir&quot;, distributed with duplicity, would allow for that easily).<p>Nowdays I use rdiff-backup, and use a second script to tar/encrypt the deltas after the backup has completed.<p>I&#x27;m keeping an eye on &quot;bup&quot; (<a href=""https://github.com/bup/bup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bup/bup</a>), but I cannot backup &quot;forever&quot;, thus without the ability of purging old versions it&#x27;s only useful in a limited set of cases.",1384190714

What I noted at that time(it may be WRONG now) was that if you wanted to work for companies as big as Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft...(it does go on) you should be good at tackling algorithmic problems and attend an university with decent reputation in CS. Otherwise, you would never get called for an interview to begin with. Knowing someone in the company also helped too. Those companies believed that a candidate with strong CS background would be worth their time spending on training him or her. On the other hand, most start-up companies were only interested in ones with strong technical background since they expected you to begin contributing to their code base by the time you join their team.

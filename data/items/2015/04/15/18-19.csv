9383271,comment,9381524,9381524,0,0,moron4hire,,,"Discounting the politics and focusing strictly on mechanics for a moment--the purpose of a participating in a hackathon should be to compete in a hackathon. I know a lot of people who have gone to them because they want to start a startup. What an absurd idea. If your purpose is to start a project, you should be able to start projects on your own. If your purpose is to meet people, there are far more frequent and better places to meet people than hackathons. If you want to be a programmer, you should be programmering.<p>I trained in martial arts for years and competed in tournaments. After a while, I got bored of tournaments. I kept training, because I liked martial arts. I wasn&#x27;t in it for the tournaments, and not going to the tournaments didn&#x27;t make me any less of a martial artist.<p>I always found it strange that there were always a few students who mostly only showed up for the tournaments. They would come to maybe one class every other week, but if there was a tournament, they were <i>there</i>. Mostly, they didn&#x27;t do well (of course, because they didn&#x27;t train in even the things that were important to tournaments), but if all they wanted was to be there in the tournament atmosphere and be able to say they competed, then that would have been fine. But that was not the case. They also <i>complained</i> that they didn&#x27;t win.<p>If their goal was to win martial arts tournaments, then they were doing it wrong. They should have been practicing forms routines in front of mirrors, to the detriment of learning wrist-locking and take-down techniques.<p>Much, much more common were the students who did show up to class every day (even though they only had two classes a week) but only ever phoned it in. They were certainly punching the card, but they weren&#x27;t particularly talented. Yes, most of the time they&#x27;d win because they were the best of the worst, they were in a division of other card-punchers. But sometimes they&#x27;d win against much more dedicated students, people who put serious training in, people who exerted a lot of effort.<p>And before I understood what tournaments were about, it upset me. Tournaments are just a reinforcement structure for an industry of selling tournaments. The market for tournaments <i>is</i> mediocre students. Hell, the market for martial arts schools is mediocre students. It&#x27;s all a self-feeding system. It makes money for the ring masters by providing a fantasy of achievement to the customer. If it were about skill, they&#x27;d lose their monetization base.<p>My point is, understand what your goals are, and do those things that further your goals. You want to be a martial artist, you get in the dojo and you train harder than everyone else. You want to compete in tournaments, just show up to the tournaments. You want to win tournaments, get in the dojo and you skip the pushups and skip the self-defense techniques and focus only on flexibility and forms.<p>If all you want is to be a programmer, then just program. If you want to win hackathons, then focus on learning the latest and greatest JS frameworks for rapid app development. Not for building big, scalable applications. Not for robust security. Not for elegant code. Just for meeting the goals.<p>The problem is that these things--hackathons, martial arts tournaments, Olympic gymnastics, junior-varsity-anything--they&#x27;re all just different types of beauty pageants. They&#x27;re inconsequential to anything that is not in their immediate sphere of influence, and that sphere is tiny. Gina&#x27;s complaint is not caused by the realization that hackathons are bullshit, it&#x27;s caused by her being <i>exposed</i> to the hackathon. It&#x27;s caused by her conflating being a programmer with competing in hackathons.<p>Which I ultimately think is a pretty rosy picture. It means that, by avoiding the hackathon, not only will she not know about the bullshit that goes on there, but she will also have more time to do the thing that really makes her happy: programming.",1429124199

I was probably 17 before my family had our first car with central locking.<p>Anyway, what happens there is you usually lock all doors before closing them. Then when you close them, if the key is inside, oops.<p>This is mitigated in slightly moderner cars by the fact that driver-side doors don&#x27;t lock when they&#x27;re open.<p>So I guess we had this beautiful period of the last 15 or 20 years where we locked our cars by pressing a button on the key.

[1]<p>I bring this up because I also find it intriguing that, in the most recent Stack Overflow developer survey (2015), India indicates more female programmers, and Sweden less (in relation to the United States).<p>I say this not to show that a more feminist country makes gender differences in personality stronger, or is causally linked to less female programmers, but rather to bunk the strength of gender-biased cultural narrative.<p>I will leave these last comments, taken from a commenter on Slate Star Codex from a different essay:<p>--<p><i>I grew up in the Soviet Union in the 1970s, at the time of “peak communism”, before leaving for greener (literally) pastures (figuratively) much later. There was plenty of casual sexism, and women (and men) were expected to marry in their early 20s, if not before, then have children right away. Women had to be as cautious as in the West when walking alone at night, and cat calls, ass grabs and unwanted sexual advances were not uncommon. Girls played with dolls and boys played with Lego (an awful Russian version of it, not snapping together well, and pieces often breaking apart), as well as soldiers and trucks.<p>But one thing virtually did not exist, to the best of my recollection, though have no stats handy. No one thought that women are less capable at STEM. Ever since Lenin declared gender equality, among other equalities, back in 1917, women had just as much acceptance in engineering and academia as men. My middle school math teacher was a female (she was very good) so was my physics teacher (she sucked beyond belief, but then I often had lousy male teachers, as well). Our math club had roughly equal numbers of boys and girls. Yeah, I was a nerdy kid. Never got any grief because of that, though plenty because of my poor social skills. My less awkward math-loving friends had few issues. There were no “jocks” that I recall, though plenty of assholes and bullies, but the latter could be just as good at math and science as the bullied. Doing well in school was never a negative. Science was not considered the domain of eggheads, it was just one of the things people did for a living.<p>Women were as expected to go into Medicine, Engineering and Science as into any other occupations. A few examples. My mother designed ship engines for a living. My grandmother was responsible for air and water quality in an area with probably half a million population. My wife’s cousin got her PhD in under Kolmogorov himself, wrote several influential papers and taught math for decades, first in the Soviet Union, then in the US. My aunt was a computer programmer and is doing very well off, having retired by now. Yet she was considered the “stupid” sister by her parents, compared to my mom who was the “smart” one. In my very STEMish university department there were as many female students as male.<p>The child benefits were such that American women can only dream of. You get paid maternity leave a month or so before your due date, with your job held for you for six months or so, and held for you for up to three years, if I recall correctly. You automatically get a bit more money when you have children. Daycare/kindergarten was free, or almost free. There was no tenure. That is, you don’t get fired once you are hired, unless you do something criminal. What with being employed by the government and all. There were plenty of downsides to that, but competing for a permanent position was not one. Of course, there was as much politics as in any research institution or a university department. Promotions were few and far between, since almost no one ever left, except to retire, or feet first. Well, I’m stretching it a bit, there were occasional layoffs, just like everywhere else. But rarely any individual firings.<p>So, the social experiment a feminist can only dream of undertaking had been run for 70 years, with a break to fight a war or two. Or three, but who’s counting. Similar social “experiments” had run in most other countries of the former Eastern Bloc. A nearly perfect control. Of course, then it all came crashing down. But not quite all. The egalitarian attitudes toward STEM and women in STEM did not change, only the economic conditions.<p>So, given all this, what do you think the result of this experiment was? Feel free to guess or look it up, or just recall what you know. I’ll reply with what I remember, once/if you comment.<p>[after a reply]<p>In my university, despite there being about 50% or so female students, and overall more of them completing their computer degree than male, there were none in the top 5 of my graduating stream of 100 or so. Most of my classmates of both genders (there were not any other genders back then) in our high school for nerds, the same one that one Grigori Perelman went to, majored in Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology or Comp Sci from the top Russian schools. About half of the guys went on to get a postgraduate degree, and only one or two women.<p>Sure looks to me like they got shortchanged by an unfairly narrow Bell curve, though maybe there are more politically correct explanations. Maybe they cared more about their family than their career, or something.<p>When the times turned sour in the 1990s, nearly all of the girls left academia and did what they had to to get by, mostly marketing, accounting, real estate or web design. Some managed to leave the country before Yeltsin hit the fan. They did pretty well in engineering and programming, and I know exactly one who went on to do a postdoc, vs maybe a dozen or so guys, who ended up having a secure research position on Russia, or a tenured position in the US.<p>None of my classmates of any gender got anywhere close to the Nobel-level, or even became somewhat famous. Well, except for Perelman, who got as famous as a mathematician can get, but we did not intersect in either high-school or university, due to the difference first in age and later in talent.<p>In any case, my point is that there was a nearly perfect experiment performed, and most Western sociologists just ignore it.</i><p>--<p>I do believe there is a gender bias, but I don&#x27;t at all believe it is even close to being the driving factor behind women&#x27;s apparent lack of interest in CS/programming or in entering/remaining in the industry.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.psych.ut.ee/~jyri/en/Schmitt-Realo-Voracek-Allik_JPSP2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psych.ut.ee/~jyri/en/Schmitt-Realo-Voracek-Allik_...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#profile-women"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#prof...</a>",1429123903

9383207,comment,9381524,9382235,0,0,spaga,,,"Relevant excerpt, courtesy of Scott Alexander and his essay, &quot;Untitled&quot; (via Slate Star Codex); this particular excerpt is about blaming &quot;nerds&quot; and for a supposed anti-women culture in tech, but addresses some gender issues relevant to the parent/grandparent and the discussion generated:<p>--<p><i>By late high school, the gap between men and women in math and programming is already as large as it will ever be. Yes, it’s true that only 20 – 23% of tech workers are women. But less than twenty percent of high school students who choose to the AP Computer Science test are women.<p>Nothing that happens between twelfth grade and death decreases the percent of women interested in computer science one whit.<p>I have no hard numbers on anything before high school, but from anecdotal evidence I know very very many young men who were programming BASIC on their dad’s old computer in elementary school, and only a tiny handful of young women who were doing the same.<p>I don’t want to get into a drawn out inborn-ability versus acculutration fight here. I want to say that I want to say that whether we attribute this to inborn ability or to acculturation, the entire gender gap has been determined in high school if not before. If anything, women actually gain a few percentage points as they enter Silicon Valley.<p>What the heck do high schoolers know about whether Silicon Valley culture is sexist or not? Even if you admit that all the online articles talking about this are being read by fourteen year olds in between Harry Potter and Twilight, these articles are a very new phenomenon and my stats are older than they are. Are you saying the is because of a high level of penetration of rumors about “toxic brogrammers” into the world of the average 11th grader?<p>The entire case for Silicon Valley misogyny driving women out of tech is a giant post hoc ergo propter hoc.<p>What’s worse, I have never heard any feminist give this case in anything like a principled way. The explanation is usually just something like of course men would use their privilege to guard a well-paying and socially prestigious field like programming from women, men have always guarded their privileges, they’ve never given anything up to women without a fight, etc.<p>My own field is medicine. More than half of medical students are female. In two years, more than half of doctors in the UK will be female, and the US is close behind.<p>Medicine is better-paying and more prestigious than programming. It’s also terrible. Medicine is full of extremely abrasive personalities. Medicine has long work hours. Medicine will laugh at you hysterically if you say you want to balance work and family life.<p>But women can’t get into medicine fast enough. Every so often medical journals and the popular news run scare stories about how there are so many women in medicine now that if they take off time to raise kids at their accustomed rates we’re suddenly going to find ourselves pretty much doctorless.<p>So any explanation of the low number of women in Silicon Valley has to equally well explain their comparatively high numbers in medicine.<p>Given all this, it’s really easy for me to see why it’s tempting to blame nerds. Look at these low-status people. It’s their fault. We already dislike them, now we have an even better reason to dislike them that nicely wraps up an otherwise embarassing mystery. They’re clearly repelling women with their rapey creepishness. It doesn’t hurt that occasional high profile stories of sexual harassment come out of Silicon Valley aren’t hard to find and bring viral.<p>(no one ever asks whether there are an equally high number of stories of sexual harassment in medicine – or law, or any other field – that no one had a reason to publicize. When I was in medical school, there was an extremely creepy incident of sexual harassment/borderline attempted rape involving a female medical student and male doctor at an outlying hospital where I worked. Nobody put it on the front page of Gawker, because the doctor involved wasn’t a nerd and no one feels any particular need to tar all doctors as sexist.)<p>But again, you really can’t blame this one on Silicon Valley nerds, unless they are breaking into high schools and harassing the women there. And possibly breaking into grade schools, demanding the young boys start tinkering with BASIC. Time for a better theory.<p>A look at percent female physicians by subspecialty is instructive. The specialty with the most women is pediatrics, followed by child psychiatry, followed by obstetrics, followed by – you get the picture. The specialties with the least women are the various surgeries – the ones where your patient is immobilized, anaesthetized, opened up, and turned into a not-quite-color-coded collection of tubes and wires to poke and prod at – the ones that bear more than a passing resemblance to engineering.<p>(surgeons are the jockiest jocks ever to jock, so you can’t blame us for this one)<p>It seems really obvious to me that women – in high schools and everywhere else – have a statistical predilection to like working with people (especially children) and to dislike working with abstract technical poking and prodding. This is a bias clearly inculcated well before SATs and AP exams, one that affects medics and programmers alike.<p>It’s a bias that probably has both cultural and biological origins. The cultural origins are far too varied to enumerate. Many people very justly bring up the issue of how our society genders toys, with parents getting very angry when girls play with stereotypically male toys and vice versa. The classic example is of course the talking Barbie who would famously say “Math is hard! Let’s go shopping!”<p>On the other hand, I also think people who neglect biological causes are doing the issue a disservice. Did you know that young monkeys express pretty much exactly the same gendered toy preferences as human children? Rhesus monkeys, vervet monkeys, pretty much whatever species of monkeys you try it on, the male monkeys enjoy wheeled toys more and the female monkeys plush toys more. The word reviewers use to describe the magnitude of the result is “overwhelming”. When intersex children are raised as other than their biological gender, their toy preference and behavior are consistently that associated with their biological gender and not the gender they are being raised as, even when they themselves are unaware their biological gender is different. This occurs even when parents reinforce them more for playing with their gender-being-raised-as toys. You can even successfully correlate the degree of this with the precise amount of androgen they get in the womb, and if you experimentally manipulate the amount of hormones monkeys receive in the womb, their gendered play will change accordingly. 2D:4D ratio, a level of how much testosterone is released during a crucial developmental period, accurately predicts scores both on a UK test of mathematical ability at age seven and the SATs in high school.<p>The end result of all this is probably our old friend gene-culture interaction, where certain small innate differences become ossified into social roles that then magnify the differences immensely. As a result, high school girls are only a fifth as likely to be interested in computer science as high school boys, and sure enough women are only a fifth as well represented in Silicon Valley as men.<p>All of this information is accessible for free to anyone who spends ten minutes doing a basic Google search. But instead we have to keep hearing how nerds are gross and disgusting and entitled and should feel constant shame for how they bully and harass the poor female programmers out of every industry they participate in. Penny blames nerds for not “holding men to account for the lack of representation of women in STEM areas” but SERIOUSLY WE DIDN’T DO IT.<p>(except insofar as we helped acculturate kids. But that’s hardly a uniquely male pasttime.)<p>(before you bring up that one paper that showed research leaders advantaged male over female researchers, keep in mind that first of all it explains only a small portion of the discrepancy, and second of all the female research leaders showed the bias even worse than the male ones. Yet Penny frames her question as “holding men to account”. This is that motte-and-bailey thing with patriarchy again.)</i><p>--",1429123801

The world is a really big place, and it&#x27;s filled with some people who are willing to pay a lot for the particular services you offer, and a lot of people who are not willing to pay a lot.  Raising your rates just means that you will self-select for engagements with the people who are willing to pay a lot.<p>When you&#x27;re an employee, your pool of opportunities is significantly more limited, at least unless you&#x27;re willing to change jobs.  So it&#x27;s a lot harder to convince people to pay you more.<p>The key mindset shift you need is the ability to a.) put yourself out there and let yourself be found by the folks who are willing to pay a lot and b.) say no to the people who are not willing to pay a lot.  (Also c.) get laughed at by folks who think it&#x27;s ridiculous how much you&#x27;re charging.)  This is uncomfortable for a lot of people; it&#x27;s still uncomfortable to me, which is why I&#x27;m not a consultant at this point, although it&#x27;s also a very necessary skill for a startup founder and so I&#x27;ll probably have to learn it and make peace with it anyway on my current trajectory.",1429122707

Jeez, I need to charge more.&quot;<p>Maybe not so fast.<p>To me the 30k is (most likely) editorial hyperbole which is not to say Patrick didn&#x27;t make $30k on some weeks.<p>If you can make (repeatedly) 30k per week (or even 15k per week) that&#x27;s a boatload of money on a yearly basis. So I would imagine that while Patrick had 1 or 5 jobs that might have paid that much, he determined that there would not be a continuing stream of work at that rate. Multiply that by 52 and see what you come up with.<p>If you could continue to charge that kind of money (and perceived a continuing demand) you could most certainly afford to hire someone to offload some of the work that is done (both admin, sales and actual consulting) to less qualified people that you could then oversee. After all not everything that a consultant like Patrick does needs to be done by Patrick. Similar to what attorneys do and other consulting firms do.<p>It is no secret to anyone who is in business that there is elasticity in pricing such that you can jack up prices on some occasions and some people will pay those rates. As such it&#x27;s possible that you (the parent comment) are charging (at the rates you are charging) less than your value. But it&#x27;s also possible that you would get drastically less work if you charged more than your per diem offsite. Even if a large consulting firm is able to charge 5x as much. (Or Patrick).<p>As a general rule, what I have found with pricing, is that it often pays to charge on a per project basis as opposed to a time basis.  I find this to be true in both how I charge (I do a small amount of consulting on the side (not the main thing I do, but close to 6 figures last year)) and how I buy consulting.<p>If I need something done and the person says &quot;$5000 for the project&quot; that is easier to spend to &quot;solve a problem&quot; then $750 per hour or &quot;$1000 per hour and it will take me 5 hours&quot;. See the difference? On the other hand if you perceive the total cost of the project is many hours and you are willing to sell those hours for $100 per hour it may pay to price like that. It all depends on the circumstance.",1429122147

You get more thrust for the same fuel flow. You can fly with a bigger nozzle, increasing this benefit. This is probably bigger than the altitude and speed benefits in subsonic airlaunch.<p>2) Air launch is flexible since you can fly a long distance to a secluded spot over the ocean and can launch in any direction. You could fly polar flights from Florida. Or low inclination orbits from California. Both of which are impossible for fixed launchers. You can fly towards an orbit&#x27;s ground track to get flexibility in launch time as well.<p>3) If you have a problem with the early rocket flight stage, you have enough altitude that gives you more emergency options. For a ground takeoff rocket, the early part of the flight is very dangerous.<p>Reaching orbit is really hard. It is extremely hard with a single stage vehicle. The problem is exponential in nature.\nThe required mass ratio is proportional to e^(required delta vee / exhaust velocity)<p>For a reference design, with 3500 m/s exhaust velocity and mission delta vee of 10 km/s, you&#x27;d need a mass ratio of 17. That means the vehicle is 16 parts fuel and 1 part rocket and payload.<p>Helping a single stage with an aerotow to 0.3 bar ambient pressure, 10 km altitude and 300 m/s speed might just help it enough. Say if delta vee is reduced 10% and average exhaust 10% as well, the required mass ratio suddenly drops to 10!<p>To demonstrate what that means: if you could make the ground launched reference rocket plane to fly to orbit with a 3,5 ton empty weight and 0,6 ton payload, (70 ton wet mass), the aerotow version could replace 2,9 tons of propellant with payload, meaning 6 times the useful payload.<p>These calculations are not very accurate, and are very sensitive to the reference design&#x27;s payload but they give you an idea of the nonlinearity.",1429122011

And really it&#x27;s this question of &quot;what are we optimizing for?&quot; (aka &quot;what&#x27;s do I want to do in my life?&quot;) that explains why we buy into the culture of overwork.<p>As in, if your goal in life is to maximize company and personal profit per time, then by all means, committing to an over kill culture will get you there. If you want to party hard (and I mean hard as in hookers and cocaine in a pent house, not a weekend camping trip to Yosemite or whatever), you will need to work hard. On the other hand, if your goal in life is to live long and healthy and or get really good at your craft, then it makes sense to limit your daily hours and be patient.<p>If you don&#x27;t know what your life goals are (and I imagine a lot of young folks are in this category), then you&#x27;ll readily buy into whatever life-goals are presented to you by whoever person has the most social influence. And the young guys who flaunt the tons of money they have made in a short amount of time through overworking really hard influence us a lot more than the old guys who intentionally don&#x27;t mention the large sum of money they&#x27;ve made working slowly over time. So we model our lives after those fast burners, and try to replicate their success despite having a different set of physical resources to work with.<p>This (lack thereof) personal life strategy will work for a tiny population of the folks who adopt it, and having known only success, they will have some level of contempt for the large majority who couldn&#x27;t do it. As for the large majority who fail, they&#x27;ll either figure out how to be patient and lead a balanced life (like the writer of this blog), or wind up with some sort of kidney disease in their 30s. And that&#x27;s really just life when you throw out all the frivolous junk of &quot;optimized load times&quot;, &quot;brand adherence&quot;, &quot;platform agnosticism&quot;, &quot;shipping deadlines&quot;, etc., it is about finding out what for yourself what you can and what you&#x27;re going to optimize for in your short several decades on this relatively eternal planet.",1429121742

On modern machines this can reliably be achieved in less than 3 seconds. There is also a mechanical brake that can be applied for emergency stop in 1 second or less. However, mechanical braking is not to be used in normal operations.<p>However, going to the maximum ramp-down rate (which for a large wind park can approach hundreds of MW/s) is usually not desirable because it will impact grid voltage. At most wind parks voltage control is accomplished using on-load tap changes of the main transformers as well as switched capacitors. Both of these need a time delay of at least 10 seconds to avoid wearing out quickly so if you ramp your whole wind farm from max output to zero in 1 or 2 seconds, you will see a big impact on grid voltage. So if we need to ramp down for a transmission system thermal constraint, we will do it at the slowest possible rate that still meets the transmission utility&#x27;s needs.",1429120827

Notice the seating.  You&#x27;re wanting to be accommodating to, among others, older people (not to mention potential disabled people), so you put them in beanbags and on hard (or maybe foam) cubes?  Perhaps, despite good intentions, they&#x27;re making unconscious assumptions about the people that have to sit on them.<p>I don&#x27;t speak for <i>all</i> women, nor do I think that <i>all</i> women have some universally shared experience.   However, I do think that it&#x27;s very possible (if not extremely likely) that despite one&#x27;s best intentions, preconceived notions/biases (including the idea that you&#x27;re an &#x27;objective&#x27; person) can preclude you from seeing other people have had different experiences than you, or came to different conclusions.<p>Those notions/biases don&#x27;t make you a bad person (we all have them, of course), but if you&#x27;re unwilling to examine them honestly at some point, then it seems reasonable to conclude that you&#x27;re probably speaking/acting in bad faith.  If a lot of (women, POC, or yes, even men, in the case of nursing[1]) are telling an existing environment that they&#x27;re unwelcoming/unfriendly in some way, then perhaps the most &#x27;reasonable&#x27; or &#x27;objective&#x27; conclusion is that there&#x27;s a problem.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.professionalnursing.org/article/S8755-7223%2810%2900146-8/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.professionalnursing.org/article/S8755-7223%2810%2...</a>",1429120800

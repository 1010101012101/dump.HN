But I would like to comment on this:<p><i>.. it launches the App Store application, presumably trying to get me to go download their custom app. Which is undoubtedly just a wrapper around a WebKit view of this exact same web site, except with more surveillance built in.</i><p>Actually the app store version of that magazine uses a custom display view that parses a JSON structure that itself is created by a parsing tool for InDesign files. It&#x27;s the same structure used by a few other well-known published apps and I inherited that project while I worked at a company called ScrollMotion in NYC. The content package for each magazine ends up being around 500MB to 1GB! Mainly insanely large image files. It does usually include some things like games and embedded videos. But the main reason it wasn&#x27;t web-based was a requirement for offline viewing. Content is pre-cached.<p>Just wanted to add that. It was a very early platform and we went on to create a much better one with an HTML5 content creator that could create much smaller packages, but that one is AFAIK, still a legacy app. It&#x27;s now under the control of Hearst.",1380743877

Rationality at root entails nothing more grand or mysterious than standing in a forest with another person and agreeing that &quot;this is a tree&quot;.  Language is born of the need to communicate with another being and logic is born of the need for precision and efficiency in communication.<p>Natural selection can shape neurological modules for language in order to propagate genes, but after that there is nothing that stops language-using primates from improving and enhancing language, making it work better, building higher and more strictly defined classes of abstractions that eventually form math, logic and science.<p>As this relates to the original subject, the primary point was that people, cryptozoologists or the religiously devout, were judging correctness by what &quot;seems&quot; correct rather than by rigorous science.  What seems correct is the strong influence of certain default neurological modules, absent training.  Only with training do people appreciate how misguided one&#x27;s instincts can be and how much better science is in communicating accurate observations.",1380743809

6484839,comment,6484605,6484605,12,0,jmduke,,,"Here&#x27;s a notion: what if we assume that the entire staff of Esquire is, at varying levels, competent at their job?<p>So jwz&#x27;s use case is that he&#x27;s an inbound link from a social media site, right? So Esquire is optimizing two things here: conversion rate to the downloaded app and amount of time spent on site.  The first one is obvious -- people who have the app downloaded are going to spend much more time overall and are going to be more valuable; the second one is a bit trickier, since you play a balancing act between getting users to dive deeper into the publication while making sure they don&#x27;t leave altogether.  In this sort of case, it&#x27;s pretty reasonable to assume that someone has either the data or intuition to say &quot;Hey, if they&#x27;re visiting our site from Facebook, they have a pretty big investment in trying to read the article than someone who Googled something vaguely related to the article.&quot;<p>(The same goes true from mobile, where audiences tend to be slower and more captive.)<p>So, if we understand the series of decisions that led us to such an experience, we then have to ask why were those decisions made?  Clearly there&#x27;s a backlash against this kind of thing -- nobody says &quot;wow, what a great banner ad!&quot; -- but its hard to argue against the financial straits of such a publication.  Esquire doesn&#x27;t have the circulation they used to, and its not a non-profit; they need to make money somehow.<p>Either way, its hardly fair to pin this on Esquire&#x27;s web designer.  Esquire&#x27;s management, maybe -- or maybe the legions of people addicted to AdBlock, the legions of people who put a low -- and getting even lower -- value on content.<p>Now, everything is hinging on that assumption that people are vaguely competent over at Esquire.  While it&#x27;s entirely possible that such an assumption is invalid, I find its a more comforting one than the opposite assumption.",1380743755

You could easily set up your own (and it&#x27;s surprising that Ulbricht did not), but you could also use any number of providers (e.g., Facebook and Google) that ostensibly know your real name.<p>When you link your OpenID to SE, SE automatically fills in your name with whatever your OpenID provider has on file. I believe this is where Stack Overflow got his real name from initially. He probably didn&#x27;t realize this would happen and when he saw that it did, he quickly changed his Stack Overflow profile to the &quot;frosty&quot; moniker.<p>Though it was absolutely boneheaded (possibly with a fair amount of hubris that he&#x27;d never get caught) to have an OpenID identity somewhere with his real name and then use it on an untrusted (to him) third-party site, had the SE login page indicated that it would pull information from his OpenID identity to create his SE profile or emphasized creating an account with SE over logging in with OpenID, he might not have had his name leak in this manner.",1380743703

You&#x27;re running your application, and some part of your code throws an exception. A window pops up with the stack trace in it. You can inspect all the objects in each frame. &quot;Inspect&quot; in Smalltalk means, see and change the properties, call methods, change the code, clone, see the class hierarchy, etc. You can modify the method that threw the exception right there from the debug window, save it, and resume the method from where it broke. Application proceeds with new code in place and problem solved.<p>Look, a cosmetic bug in this window. Right click on it, click Inspect. Looks like one of the properties has the wrong value. Edit the property from the inspector, fix the problem. The application was running the whole time and now is fixed.<p>An impressive thing you can do with Fuel is serialize and deserialize the exception with all state. Somebody blows up your web application. You wrote a bit of code to catch unhandled exceptions and export them with Fuel. You download the binary to your local computer and deserialize it in your live Smalltalk image. You see the debugger window pop up and can examine all the state when the error happened as if it popped up locally. See, examine, change the code, all of it live the whole time. (I don&#x27;t know if this is done in practice much, but it&#x27;s pretty normal to run a headless Smalltalk image and connect to it over VNC when you need to debug something).<p>To sum up, everything is live all the time in Smalltalk, and you can interactively change all the actual running instances, both code and data, at any time without interrupting anything.",1380743329

6484587,comment,6483699,6483699,21,0,stiff,,,"This is such a shallow view of the topic. If you do good software engineering, all your programs also make great APIs for their problem domain, and there is only a few new things you need to learn about deploying them more widely if you fancy doing so. Making a great API is simply writing a great program, and here is what you have to go through to make one:<p>- You identify the best set of data and the best abstractions to represent whatever your program is modelling. This is a tricky conceptual part that often requires deep thought and sometimes several rewrites. You can represent a point in space as a triple of separate coordinates, but you will collapse under the mess of details if you try to build a 3D engine this way, and keep in mind this representation was already a revolution in thinking over the approach of the ancient Greeks, one that took mankind more than a thousand years and kickstarted calculus and then modern physics.<p>Good abstractions can simplify thinking so much as to allow doing completely new things, but they can also be very hard to find. I think linear algebra, which is what makes the 3d engine doable, is one of the more beautiful examples of this and one that should be studied carefully by prospective software engineers. It also isn&#x27;t something that only comes up doing very sophisticated things, in the most mundane applications choosing a different set of variables to represent state might produce a revolutionary simplification. If you fail to do this step well, there is no way you are going to produce a good program, and frequently you won&#x27;t produce nothing at all. An API that exposes wrong abstractions will be clunky to use no matter what else you do.<p>- You identify the constraints that make the data meaningful. A point on the screen might be represented by integers: x and y describing the position, and r, g and b describing the colors, but not all tuples of 5 integers will be valid representations of a point on the screen.<p>- You specify a set of operations preserving those constraints. You choose the names for those operations carefully. You make the argument list easy to remember. You make the most common use case the default one. You think carefully about which information is useful enough to return. You respect the conventions of the domain you are operating in. You use consistent naming. You write tests making sure your operations don&#x27;t violate those constraints. ..., this is a whole craft to learn.<p>- You look for the best distribution and division of this data and operations into individual classes/modules. This again takes a lot of experimentation. You never, ever, EVER mix the abstract model of the problem domain with the messy details of what goes on the screen, with database accesses, with external API calls etc.<p>All this is not a sequential process, the activities have to be done repeatedly and in various order and you almost always need several attempts. Identify data, find abstractions, apply constraints, find a way to ensure operations preserve constraints - everything that was done in software engineering revolves around this, aspect oriented programming, design by contract, TDD, structured programming, formal methods, OOP, FP, generic programming, ...<p>However you approach it, you not only want to end up with a correct program that does what you want it to do, but also with a clear language that expresses the problem you are solving. Then your program is easy to understand for you and for others, hence more likely to be bug-free, easy to maintain and modify, and easy to expose as an external API.<p>Read some classic papers:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/criteria.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/crite...</a><p><a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.136.8193&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.136...</a><p><a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS4860/2012fa/Supplemental%20Notes%20lec-26-3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS4860/2012fa/Supplemental...</a><p>And some modern classics:<p><a href=""http://www.stepanovpapers.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stepanovpapers.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/richard.bird/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/richard.bird/</a><p>Maybe we will live to see times when software engineering is a real profession...",1380741405

Even if you believe the only morally problematic charge is 5.b of count 1 (that the defendant hired a hitman to murder a troublesome user--I do hope you find <i>that</i> charge problematic!), which is certainly only alleged at this point, it is fact that the Silk Road aided and abetted drug trafficking, which is criminal in the U.S.<p>So while I certainly agree that people need to be entitled to a competent defense (and I am glad DPR will have competent attorneys to dispute the murder charge), emphasizing the alleged nature of a criminal conspiracy that we realistically know to be largely true doesn&#x27;t seem to be the best place to focus on rights of the accused. In reality, the vast majority of people wrongfully convicted are going to be the ones who can&#x27;t afford competent defense. So to me this case almost raises the opposite question from yours: if the prosecution of guilty defendants is undermined by their being able to afford better attorneys than the government, and if the defense of wrongfully accused defendants is undermined by their inability to afford competent defense, then we&#x27;ve got bigger problems with the nature of criminal trials!",1380741385

6484533,comment,6482461,6484066,3,0,spacelizard,,,"I don&#x27;t believe the proprietary model is fundamentally capitalist. Copyright is a monopoly that depends on law to manipulate people into giving up ownership. Even if your analogy did hold up, everyone already DOES own their own computers. Proprietary licensed software tries to convince you to co-opt that ownership, by giving up some control of your computer.  Your mistake is in assuming that by default, control of your computer does not belong to you. It does, but you give it up when you fall for the proprietary trap. The reason why copyleft is set up the way it is is because it&#x27;s an attempt to prevent anyone from using the code in question to take advantage of copyright in that manner.<p>I get the analogy but I don&#x27;t think it draws a reasonable comparison because it confuses the software with the license. The confusion is understandable because proprietary companies deliberately spread it. They want to blur the line between software and license so people have a harder time understanding their politics. But like you said, the software is not the product, the license is the product. Proprietary licenses aren&#x27;t about restricting someone&#x27;s ability to sell licenses, it&#x27;s about keeping you from using their sales pitch. Copyleft is about making sure that no one can stifle anyone else&#x27;s ability to use a certain sales pitch.",1380740903

Now we have more bizarre configurations to mess with and avoid.<p>Yet despite your experience, Ubuntu has grown to be by far the most widespread Linux desktop, despite tiny resources compared to several of their competitors. Clearly <i>someone</i> likes it, despite your attempt to imply it&#x27;s all just marketing, which is frankly insulting. Canonical does not have even a tiny fraction of the money they&#x27;d have needed to win the kind of userbase they have just off of marketing.<p>>  and marketing is a too strong force to see through. Canonical I believe has invested as much in marketing as in usability and testing.<p>Maybe. But for my part I&#x27;d been using Redhat and Fedora for a decade and managed to avoid noticing any marketing for Ubuntu - I ended up trying it because I use Debian for a lot of server at work, but the Debian desktop experience is horrific. I fully expected wiping it, or at least getting rid of Unity in favour of a tiling WM or something. Instead it took about an hour of use to decide to make it my new main distro.<p>> You dont hear about them or them, because they are not on hacker news or reddit to discuss the latest Linus and Mir vs Wayland debate. Just happy users, who get frustrated when they have to boot into windows due to their wish to consume drm material, such as netflix, so frustrated in fact they stopped using netflix and found other services that arent digitally damaged. Amazing story right?<p>Nothing amazing about it, and I don&#x27;t see who you&#x27;d think there&#x27;s nothing special about that, and this is one of the reasons why I expect the Mir vs Wayland debate to mean <i>nothing</i>: Ordinary users don&#x27;t care. The people who complain about Canonical are a tiny subset of users for whom it violates some kind of philosophical purity.<p>> Also concerning GTK and Qt, here too the users usually wonder why the app look different, even though I spent some time making them look almost the same. It distracts just a little bit from the Kommon Desktop Environment when GIMP isnt pixel perfect.<p>These mythical users are very interesting, given that they must be <i>incredibly</i> inexperienced with computers - any user that have used any reasonable number of Windows apps, for example, or used Windows over more than 2-3 years will be used with apps that vary wildly in UI style. Personally, I&#x27;ve never met a user that notices stuff like that. I <i>have</i> met plenty of users that can&#x27;t tell the difference between IE and Firefox without help to identify which one they&#x27;re using, or who happily insist they&#x27;re using MS Word while they&#x27;re using OO/LibreOffice, without noticing, though.<p>Users who get distracted by minor details like that will be distracted regardless of environment, and indulging their fantasy of consistency does nothing good for them.<p>> Now with Mir and Wayland we will just have more of this weirdness, quirkiness and strange bugs.<p>Yet somehow users have managed just fine with the proliferation of <i>dozens</i> of window managers and other tools. To me this diversity is the strength of open source. Sometimes it causes pain here and there, but it also lets the best win.<p>> And this is exactly the problem that Mir/Canonical introduce too GNU/Linux. Now we have more bizarre configurations to mess with and avoid.<p>If you don&#x27;t like diversity, don&#x27;t use open source. It&#x27;s that simple. Nobody has any obligation to try to please you.

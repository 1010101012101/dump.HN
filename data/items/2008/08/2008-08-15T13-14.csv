276975,comment,276687,276966,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"Personally I found the ORA REST book did a good job of explaining some of the key problems that using HTTP RESTfully solves and the benefits that brings.<p>I think one of the key points of the book was that Flickr and Delicious could do better with their implementations of a REST API. Just because something is successful doesn't make it optimal.<p>I absolutely that adhering to something for it's own sake is stupid and dogmatic, I think that suggesting improvements to an implementation based on known benefits of an architecture is perfectly valid.",1218808452

This could mean we have 100x the voting locations that we have now - one at every post office, public library, starbucks, what have you.",1218808126

276966,comment,276687,276949,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>I think calling REST a religion is pretty unfair</i><p>If ""religion"" here means what it usually means in tech discussions, namely a rigid attachment to an allegedly ""right"" way of doing things, then I don't think it's unfair at all. I bought the O'Reilly book on REST expecting to learn a lot about web app design, and was really taken aback to find that it was 80% dogma. Having assumed that REST=good, the authors then praise or reject various designs not for what they actually do, but for how closely they adhere to REST. For example, they criticize delicious and flickr for not being proper REST apps, which is pretty amusing.<p>Incidentally, I don't think the point here is that RPC is better than REST. There are more than two choices. The point is that conforming to REST for its own sake is an example of dogmatic thinking.",1218807571

276952,comment,276866,276866,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It doesn't matter which DVCS you use, particularly since you haven't mentioned using CVS (thank god). Use whatever the designers will actually <i>use</i>. If they're already comfortable with SVN use SVN; the git-svn integration tools are not as great as an all-git setup, but I've been using them with great happiness. And there are quite a few competing GUI clients for SVN.<p>Pay Devguard or github or somebody to host your VCS. Don't waste your client's money setting it up yourself.<p>Given this sentence:<p><i>Unscheduled downtime of more than a couple minutes is unacceptable any time.</i><p>My first instinct would be to try and get the production server mirrored to a nigh-identical second box that you can, in a pinch, fail over to. Once you know how to do that you can clone one or the other of these redundant production servers to a staging server and test your new code on that.<p>For all of those tasks you use boxes that resemble your production box -- same Unix version, PHP4, MySQL 4. Slicehost VPS instances are cheap. Rental servers are cheap. But trying to get your motley collection of Macs and PCs to accurately simulate your deployment environment may cost a lot of time.<p>You can use your local machines for development if you want, then upload the results to the staging server for testing, but even that might be a big time sink, depending on the nature of your app. I've been working that way, but I've now been bitten more than once by bugs that are caused by slight differences in versions or modules between my Mac's PHP/MySQL setup and that on the production servers. I've begun to wonder whether it might be better to just get each developer a remote development VPS (or a directory on a shared development VPS), install identical clones of the development code and the database for each developer, and have everyone develop over a SSH connection, and/or via an intelligent sFTP client like Transmit for the Mac. This, I'm told, is how Flickr develops new code -- their production environment has too many moving parts to be worth simulating on a single local machine. But, of course, I'm an emacs user so the thought of editing files over SSH isn't <i>that</i> horrifying.<p>If you're going to be tinkering with mission-critical code that costs $N per minute every time you introduce a bug, you may need to move the writing of tests up in the calendar.<p>Don't forget the bug tracking! I'm not in love with Trac but it gets the job done -- again, pay somebody like Devguard to host it for you; don't waste time setting it up yourself. Or try Lighthouse or something else if you don't like Trac. Try out Basecamp.",1218805636

There&#x27;s a huge difference between that and a small icon in the location bar. Plus, if the red icon that is suggested in that bug report is too loud, a less loud indicator could be used instead.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more to designing a UI for this than just changing the icon. For example, when you type &quot;foo.com&quot; into the address bar, browsers generally default to &quot;<a href=""http://foo.com&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com&quot;</a> instead of &quot;<a href=""https://foo.com.&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://foo.com.&quot;</a> And, consequently, browsers tend to show &quot;<a href=""http://foo.com&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com&quot;</a> as &quot;foo.com&quot; to suggest that you don&#x27;t need to type the &quot;<a href=""http://&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://&quot;</a> part. All of that needs to change to become a lot smarter in order for this type of idea to succeed. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem completely unreasonable to consider making all those changes. In fact, I think these changes should be a high priority for browsers makers.<p>tl;dr: I suggest people brainstorm ways to improve upon the idea to make it workable, instead of trying to shoot it down.",1405738509

8056483,comment,8052589,8052927,1,0,vacri,,,"To be fair, the reason why only 90% of English speakers would get every word in that poem right is because there&#x27;s a lot of very uncommon words in there. &#x27;Sward&#x27; or &#x27;phlegmatic&#x27; are not things I&#x27;ve ever heard used in casual conversation. I&#x27;m pretty well read, but I have never heard of Terpsichore before today. Similarly, Arkansas is an American peculiarism - I wouldn&#x27;t expect a non-American to get that one right, same with Islington being a UK peculiarism. Probably should have left names out of the poem, because names have a ridiculously wide allowance for pronunciation.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting that the poem writer has a particular accent:\n<i>Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,\nFriend and fiend, alive and live.</i>\nWhere I live, grieve and sieve rhyme, and neither rhyme with any verson of &#x27;live&#x27; (though they do rhyme with &#x27;leave&#x27;...).

8056451,comment,8052589,8056059,2,0,bane,,,"Sure thing! Glad you&#x27;ve been using Anki also. /r/korean is definitely growing and becoming more active. It used to be pretty dead about a year ago but it&#x27;s really coming to life as an awesome resource recently.<p>The main deck I&#x27;ve been working with is the 1000 most common. I figure that will get me up to speed enough to start digging into basic grammar without getting too hung up on common vocabulary. It&#x27;s a pretty good deck, a few of the definitions I&#x27;ve been changing a bit because they&#x27;re either not clear or not quite right (after running them past my wife). It&#x27;s a little lacking in nouns, it&#x27;s much more focused on common verbs, connecting terms (like 그런데) and support words like 뿐. So I&#x27;m already planning on following up with some more dedicated noun study.<p>At the moment, kdramas and movies are pretty impenetrable for me. It&#x27;ll take me about an hour to get through a 5-10 minute youtube video with lots of subtitles, and I only get about 5-30% depending. 영국남자 is pretty good. For example I got about 40-50% of this video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFRUoygkaeI&list=UUg-p3lQIqmhh7gHpyaOmOiQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFRUoygkaeI&list=UUg-p3lQIqm...</a> which is not bad after a month of study.<p>Korean is one of the hardest languages for English speakers to learn. The Foreign Service Institute ranks languages based on the average number of study hours it takes an English speaker to achieve proficiency in Speaking and Reading. To achieve what they call &quot;general proficiency&quot; which is basic fluency (or a 3/3 in reading and speaking), it takes about 600 hours to learn a Category I language like French, Spanish or Norwegian. A category V language takes about 2200 hours of study and the languages in that group are Arabic (for various linguistic reasons), Chinese (speaking is considered relatively easy, like a Cat I but reading is incredibly hard), Japanese (speaking is hard, plus all the downsides of written Chinese) and Korean (speaking is hard and particularly listening is difficult, especially with the double consonants and very specific vowel distinction we don&#x27;t make in spoken English).<p>The Defense Language Institute (DLI) ranks it a Category IV (the highest) as well - at 64 weeks of intense, 8 hour a day instruction. I think this number has shrunk as well as I know a few DLI trained Korean speakers who swear they spend almost 2 years there. While French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish are over in 26 weeks. DLI&#x27;s language education goal is actually lower than FSI&#x27;s and the goal is only 2/2.<p>To compare, a language like Finnish, Russian or Vietnamese, one category down, is expected to be done after only 1,100 class hours, or half the time.",1405736481

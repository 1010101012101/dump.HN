8779325,comment,8778253,8778884,0,0,jarcane,,,"In Finland, mandatory primary and secondary schooling ends at 16, after which point you can choose to either go into a trade /apprenticeship school, or an academic school (high-school/university), or not go at all. And all of it is free (though there&#x27;s rumors they might start charging tuition for university in a couple of years). The schools themselves also go to great lengths to ensure that everyone graduates on the same &#x27;level,&#x27; even in the lower schools.<p>The result is one of the most well-educated and trained workforces in the world. It&#x27;s also an incredibly competitive  job market, because almost everyone applying has the equivalent of at least a two-year degree, and if it&#x27;s an academic profession, probably a Master&#x27;s. Almost no union will take you as well if you haven&#x27;t finished a trade school or higher school. There&#x27;s talk now of them making post-secondary education mandatory as well for two years, because anyone who doesn&#x27;t go into trade school or high school is more or less fucked on the job market. The kids who don&#x27;t want to go to school after 16 wind up on unemployment and living with their parents because there&#x27;s almost zero chance of getting any kind of employment without further education.<p>It&#x27;s been interesting to see and learn how degree inflation works on the market here. In one sense this is a lot like the states, where in many fields now, anything less than a Bachelor&#x27;s degree is useless. In another sense though, unlike the states this hasn&#x27;t resulted in the &#x27;diploma mill&#x27; effect, where those Bachelor&#x27;s degrees have become utterly devalued and useless because they more or less hand them out to anyone willing to keep showing up for four years.<p>And as well, there are more options here for trades instead of going into academics, so it&#x27;s not like there aren&#x27;t options if you don&#x27;t go into university. There are trade school courses in everything: I know a bloke who went to school for two years just to be a waiter. So unlike the states, where that diploma mill inflation can feel limiting because there&#x27;s only so many academic subjects available, it seems like there&#x27;s a lot more viable different routes to pursue towards finding a career.",1419152057

It remains to be seen how much moral hazard this little excursion into the loan markets by the federal government creates.<p>One program that doesn&#x27;t really get much attention in the media (maybe because it was more nuanced and complicated?) was the TALF program [1]. I did a summer internship in 2009 with the Federal Reserve Bank in New York and it really seemed like that program was their primary concern because it was much more directed at the private loan market with targeted loans at &quot;normal&quot; spreads (whatever that meant at the time...) To date, I guess, they&#x27;ve made ~$173m [2]. The design of TALF was wayyy different than TARP, both in scale and objective.

But that was what I meant (when I read it back it sounded a bit snarly; not intended); it doesn&#x27;t have to feel like that? It&#x27;s just great get some of the feel for the games/software back without it having to feel like <i>that</i> magical. Actually it doesn&#x27;t feel magical to me anymore; quite the opposite but in a very relaxing way. The frustration with the (far more magical if you put it that way) process of modern software writing isn&#x27;t there. It is frustrating in that if you do one thing wrong, all crashes and you have to wait for a reboot, however that actually gets you to focus better on not getting it wrong... But I don&#x27;t have that thing which should work but does not work because of some software update Apple did or some input is wrong but no-one knows why (expressed by stackoverflow answers like: try to reboot, quit xcode and start again etc in 6 answers which all do not solve your identical issue). I have the advantage that I actually like the games a lot from the 80s (that must be nostalgia indeed) and people are still actively working on software for these machines, amazing things which cannot be done if you don&#x27;t know <i>everything</i> about these systems like [1] (on 3.58 mhz (!) computers).<p>[1] <a href=""http://symbos.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symbos.org</a>",1419150063

The primary market for Sun has always been the enterprise, so it was a natural target.<p>Then, when the web exploded, people found out that developing against a virtual machine could be safer and more predictable than developing against the operating system, so web-app servers were born. J2EE provided a certain degree of consistency, which other platforms did not have.<p>As platforms evolved, they tried to generalise their use-cases, which introduced a number of abstractions and forced decoupling; and because Java2 lacked support for a lot of introspection/metaprogramming features, you had to explicitly cover a lot of cases, leading to interfaces multiplying.<p>It didn&#x27;t help that at the time, the &quot;Pattern&quot; movement was popularised and their tools (which are all about decoupling and introducing further levels of abstractions) became overused.",1419149379

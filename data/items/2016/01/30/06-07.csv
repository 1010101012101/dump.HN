And I&#x27;m not trying to bring this research down because I don&#x27;t doubt the results, but I am curious, and a bit skeptical, if this is a true step forward in catching &quot;real&quot; bugs or just surface ones. Even a sophisticated algorithm such as this. It takes into account features such variable scope and the operations performed on them, and is trained by real examples of bug patches on open source projects. Can it really understand my project? Because my logical bugs are specific to my project. It kind of reminds me of a recommendation IntelliJ once gave me for the following code:<p>return {left: am.left, top: am.right};<p>&quot;WARNING: &#x27;right&#x27; should probably not be assigned to &#x27;top&#x27;&quot;<p>This sounds like the kind of conclusion that such an algorithm might come to after seeing enough examples of similar bugs. It turns out that my code in this situation is actually correct, but in order to know this, you would have to have a thorough understanding of the rest of the program.",1454137197

Basically we encourage researchers to collaborate because it&#x27;s financially lucrative to do so. By making researchers wealthy they&#x27;re able to release themselves from being dependent on prestige publications for generating funding. As a result of this we can start to deprecate the somewhat toxic &quot;public or perish&quot; incumbent system.

In keeping with Gates&#x27; philosophy, when working effectively with non-governmental levels of capital it&#x27;s critical to make sure you leverage as much as possible to effect real change. Things that play out across a long timespan (relative to a human lifespan) are an excellent opportunity to accomplish that.<p>Education: We&#x27;ve had teacher-run schools. We&#x27;ve more recently had test/metric run schools. Let&#x27;s (in the US) finally try and effectively fuse those two into better outcomes per dollar for kids in public schools. My personal pet peeve: develop a modeling technique that predicts an &quot;average&quot; educational outcome for a student given his or her family&#x27;s socioeconomic status and other inputs. Then at least we have a basis for a fair measure of teacher success -- no teacher can turn every child who grows up without a single book in the home into Albert Einstein or Marie Curie.<p>Economics: Post-scarcity minimum / basic income, as mentioned.<p>Democracy: Follow on and unify the various open-* voter information efforts (example: <a href=""http://votesmart.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://votesmart.org/</a> ) and find the best and most unbiased way to communicate that. Democracy only works with an informed electorate, and we can do much better than throwing our hands up and letting the most ad buys have the strongest influence.<p>Nutrition: There&#x27;s a huge amount of bogus advice out there.

11000837,comment,10996171,11000423,0,0,xyzzy123,,,"I think it depends on what you mean by &quot;error&quot;. Certainly Haskell is not a silver bullet here.<p>As a person who works at a large organisation focused on correctness, there are some crazy intersections between what &quot;error&quot; means, what programs do, and how humans work. In general, if you can clearly define what &quot;error&quot; means, you can <i>mostly</i> solve it with a sufficiently good language. That is not so easy.<p>The &quot;automatic&quot;[1] hammers we seem to have are good type systems and &quot;Design By Contract&quot; (think Eiffel, but having a strong proof assistant is a much more powerful case). In this case, I&#x27;m discussing the problem from a security point of view:<p>Some examples in order of difficulty:<p>* Process errors outside software; OK, these are usually not the programmer&#x27;s fault. For example, Amazon account hijacking via customer service. No way to point-fix; DBC or typing won&#x27;t help you.<p>* Software interaction with humans; I&#x27;ve seen regexes to disallow shipping (e.g. for identity documents) to P.O boxes, which allow the input &quot;POSTAL BOX&quot; rather than a variant of &quot;PO BOX&quot;, &quot;P.O BOX&quot;, &quot;POSTAL BOX&quot;, &quot;LOCKED BAG&quot; or so on. The problem is that the data will be eventually interpreted by a human, who will correct the error and ensure delivery. AFAICT not fixable with DBC or typing - you need a business process improvement here.<p>* Ambient or environmental changes. The call you used to make to a third-party library or binary <i>was</i> secure, but now it isn&#x27;t. For example, your app used RC4 or $RANDOM_BINARY, and it used to be secure, but now it isn&#x27;t because your environment changed out from under you. Now your code needs a countermeasure or a fix.<p>* Subtle business logic errors such as missing a permissions check on private profile or data views - probably only fixable with proof or DBC, type system is not the right hammer here although maybe with effort you can sort of do it. Probably encoding rapidly changing business rules into your types is not a good idea though.<p>* Obvious business logic errors, e.g. allowing -1 books to be ordered in an online store; fixable with a good type system or DBC. (e.g. type &quot;Quantity&quot; is a natural number rather than a machine type).<p>* XSS or SQLI - should be fixed by type system alone in a sufficiently advanced language.<p>It&#x27;s mostly the relatively trivial stuff at the bottom of this stack of possible errors which is fixable by good programming languages, assuming of course that your DBC logic or way you structure your typing is correct.<p>As a total aside, what would be really interesting to me would be a powerful &quot;business process definition language&quot;, which could map data flow between systems and humans - and actually describe the real-world information flows when a user contacts customer support to reset their password. If that could interact with contracts or proofs in individual applications, my world would be rocked.<p>[1] Not requiring humans to check when changes happen, although obviously human effort is required during system definition.",1454136098

I think any price gouging in entertainment is likely to run up against this issue.<p>If netflix is the only place I can watch House of Cards, and it costs $50, I either won&#x27;t watch it (do I really care that much?) or somebody else who got it will pirate it. But why would somebody pirate it when they paid $50? Simple, if I paid for it, and I thought I over-paid, you are my friend and you didn&#x27;t pay for it because you thought it was too much, maybe I give you a copy because I&#x27;m a good friend. Of course, you know so much more of the world would want to enjoy it, but don&#x27;t want to pay, so you make it available to more people.<p>The price of netflix may be artificially low right now, but is it 30% low, or 200% low?

They get forces around 70 μN. This is very small, and although they have a balance sensitive enough to measure it, there are lots of effects which can produce tiny forces like that.<p>The experimental work described in the paper is disappointing, in that the original cavity system apparently had a Q of something like 100,000, but their system only has a Q of 50, because it&#x27;s mistuned for the microwave oven magnetron they&#x27;re using. (&quot;Unfortunately, the absorption peak at the resonance we were aiming at was smaller then expected  (probably also due to misalignments after soldering).&quot;) The highest thrust reported by anybody with this is 720 mN, but that was in air. They&#x27;re almost four orders of magnitude below that, in vacuum.  For reference, the ion thrusters on the Dawn spacecraft deliver 90mN.<p>If they had hardware that generated 720mN in air, and tried that in hard vacuum, that would be useful. (In air, all sorts of things, such as heating or electrostatic repulsion, can generate air movement and thus tiny amounts of thrust.  So results in air are not too interesting.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://moscow.sci-hub.bz/ded43880657f12f27fc596f46abbbfe6/10.2514@6.2015-4083.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moscow.sci-hub.bz/ded43880657f12f27fc596f46abbbfe6/10...</a>",1454135942

11000784,comment,10998493,11000620,0,0,orionblastar,,,"You got downvoted because you attacked religion and authority.<p>Let me try and make a point. When Steve Jobs founded Apple he also had founded a religion that worshiped technology. Apple had a certain cult following of Apple users wanting to belong to Apple&#x27;s culture and way of life. Steve Jobs wanted a different company than IBM and other corporations, he wanted Apple to be different from Microsoft. Steve Jobs was an authority on how computers should work and function. He tried to make easier to use computers with the Lisa and original Macintosh but both failed because they cost a lot and didn&#x27;t have a lot of apps available for them. After being fired in 1985 or resigning whatever you want to believe, Steve Jobs founded a new company named Next that used Unix instead of starting over from scratch. Steve Jobs tried to create a new religion with a new company. Apple struggled without Steve Jobs, it seemed as if the CEO chair at Apple had an ejector seat. When Steve Jobs was brought back at Apple he turned around the company and got people interested in the new projects they worked on. Apple has this user experience factor that just attracts people to their religion. The iPhones and iPads basically sell themselves and the Macintosh sells itself because it doesn&#x27;t have the flaws of a Windows PC. Even after Steve Jobs died, Apple still has a religious following to it.<p>Sure there is a religious experience wired into our genes to worship something and obey some sort of authority. Which is why people follow politicians as authority figures even if they pass laws taking away rights and freedoms and doing domestic spying. It is why some people worship sports stars or musicians or movie makers or even the rich elite.<p>Atheists for some reason don&#x27;t seem to have this gene to worship something. Their brains are wired for skepticism and they question authority instead of blindly follow them.<p>The more math and science one learns, the more likely one is to become an atheist. This is a problem Islam faced when they had their golden age of science and math discoveries. It is what had stopped the golden age out of fear that people would abandon Islam and worship science and math instead. The Catholic Church also faced this and it lead to the dark ages. In fact India, China, and other nations, once they stopped researching math and science, their empires declined.<p>During the golden age in Europe, people wanted to worship science.<p>The more science, math, and technology advances the more likely people will abandon religion because they don&#x27;t need it anymore.<p>Sure you got Dawkins criticizing religion in many areas, he used to be a Catholic but lost his faith. People see him as an authority and want to follow him as well. He has written great books on biology and is very smart.<p>People want to follow some authority figure and be like them, they want leaders to tell them how to live their lives and what the meaning of life is to them. Be it a God, a politician, a business person, a sports figure, a musician, a singer, an atheist, whatever people want to follow someone they think has it all figured out. I think this is some part of evolution and in our genes but not everyone has this in their genes. It goes back a long way when people formed tribes for survival. Perhaps before religion was developed. Every tribe has a leader who is an authority figure. For religions that leader happened to be a God or in the case of Buddhism a human being who discovered enlightenment and the end to suffering.<p>Even if there was no belief in a God or Gods, there still would be a religion worshiping something else.<p>The rich elite worship money and power for example, and most have stopped practicing their religions in order to spend more time to manage their businesses.<p>The poor who can&#x27;t find a good paying job, turn to religion for hope and help. There exists a fellowship of people they can get support and advice from.<p>I don&#x27;t know if any of this makes sense to you. But religion plays a role in humanity and has played a role in evolution as well. Over time people have followed a religion because of some basic need for hope and understanding. As technology and medical science advances people leave religion because they feel they don&#x27;t need it anymore as problems are solved by technology and medical science.<p>The human race goes through a social evolution as well, changes to society that don&#x27;t always agree with religious views.",1454134542

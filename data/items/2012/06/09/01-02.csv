4086916,comment,4086757,4086860,4,0,AJ007,,,"Whether or not they are using dynamic keyword insertion is irrelevant.<p>Here is a comparison for consideration. I bid on ""free credit report."" The FTC isn't going to give a shit if I put ""Free Credit Report"" in my ad, or I bid on ""free credit report"" and used dynamic insertion. Its all the same thing, I now qualify for their draconian rule set for companies advertising to provide free credit reports. (By the way, do a search for ""free credit report"" on Google, notice anything special?)<p>Citrix placed the name of a federally trademarked business in their ad copy. Additionally, that trademark is for a direct competitors of theirs (not a fruit seller with an ad for an ""Apple."") Thirdly, the promised product, Meetingburner, is not actually there. Thus, they are guilty of both trademark infringement and deceptive advertising.<p>At bare minimum, Meetingburner would send a C&D. At best they could demand a six figure settlement and a guarantee they will never bid on ""Meetingburner"" or run ads with ""Meetingburner"" in them again (killed two birds with one stone, since Citrix legally could bid on the term.) In the extreme they could refuse a settlement and take it to trial, and probably win. After legal expenses, likely a loss for both sides.<p>I've been on the receiving end of this before. I learned not to use dynamic insertion.<p>As for Adwords -- ""Unfortunately, reaching out to the AdWords team at Google isnt an easy task. This does appear to be against the Terms of Service for AdWords, but since its so close to the weekend, the ads might stay up for the next few days."" -- Yeah, good luck with that. They let big advertisers do basically whatever the hell they want. I've watched very explicit rule violations slide for well in excess of a year.",1339206628

This R&D credit is designed to allow startups to offset employee taxes, freeing up resources to help these young companies expand and create jobs.<p>5 - Use existing federal R&D funding to better support university initiatives designed to bring cutting-edge R&D to the marketplace more quickly, where it can propel economic growth.\nRequire government agencies to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of proposed major rules with an economic impact of $100 million or more.<p>6 - Direct the U.S. Department of Commerce to assess state and local policies that aid in the development of new businesses.<p>(a) <a href=""http://polis.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=298355"" rel=""nofollow"">http://polis.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=2...</a>",1339206487

In my opinion this solves a non-existing problem. Developers can already deploy to multiple service providers with almost zero effort, because all service providers rely on open standards for deploying web applications. As a result portability is incredibly good between dotCloud, Heroku, Cloudfoundry and almost everybody else. Of course it's up to the developer to not lock themselves into proprietary APIs which are only available on certain service providers (eg. App Engine).",1339204689

4086855,comment,4083998,4086780,7,0,btilly,,,"Not at all.<p>Start with linear transformation F from vector space V to vector space W, each of which has a basis (v1, ..., vn) and (w1, ..., wn).  The matrix M representing F in that pair of bases is (F(v1) F(v2) ... F(vn)) where each vector is written as a column.<p>Given those bases it is easy to demonstrate that every linear function can be uniquely represented that way.<p>Thanks to the properties of linearity, it is easy to demonstrate that the special case of matrix multiplication of a matrix against a column is the same as applying that linear function to the corresponding vector.  Furthermore you can demonstrate that given the basis and the matrix, you have actually defined a linear function.  (Therefore completing the demonstration that matrices are a notation for linear functions, and linear functions are what matrices represent.)<p>With that in mind the matrix representing (F o G) is going to be ((F o G)(v1) ... (F o G)(vn)).  And when you unwind that definition you find that function composition turns into matrix multiplication.  (As long as all of the bases match up of course, don't forget them!)<p>At this point you now have a rule for matrix multiplication.  Thanks to the correspondence to linear functions, you can derive all of its algebraic properties (including associativity) from the corresponding properties of linear functions.<p>Incidentally by keeping track of the role of the basis throughout the presentation, you make it much easier to work out change of basis matrices later.  Which has a lot of potential to be confusing because they work out to be the inverse of what you'd naively guess them to be.  For instance if you rotate your basis 30 degrees clockwise, the change of basis matrix you get is a rotation 30 degrees counter-clockwise.  (This happens for the same reason that while you spin clockwise, it looks to you like the world is spinning counter-clockwise.)<p>So how do you get the change of basis matrix?  Well, go back to the definition.  Make your function be the identity (everything remains the same, and then you just write out a matrix which has each column being, in the new basis, the coordinates of the basis vectors for the old basis.<p>Now an exercise to demonstrate to yourself that you really understood this.  Let V be the vector space of polynomials of degree at most 2, and W be the vector space of polynomials of degree at most 1.  Let F be the linear function called ""differentiation"".  Start with a coordinate system on V which is just (p(0), p(1), p(2)) and a corresponding coordinate system on W which is just (p(0), p(1)).  In that pair of coordinate systems, what matrix represents F?<p>If you can figure that out, you probably understood the whole thing.  If not, well...<p>(Big hint.  There is a different pair of coordinate systems in which you can easily write down the answer.  Use that fact...)",1339204595

A lot of startups are looking for investments, but I ask why they need it.<p>If you open a store in your street, nobody is going to invest for you (well, it is not usual at least). You are still risking your old job, and going to have hard days in the next days. In fact, you are investment a lot of money on it too.

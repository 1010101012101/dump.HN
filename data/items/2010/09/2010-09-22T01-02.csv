1714906,comment,1714618,1714618,0,0,nhashem,,,"I honestly think it doesn't matter.  I have about 10 years of professional experience, and while I used to write thank-you e-mails and even snail mail letters on every job interview I went on when I was younger, I stopped doing it a long time ago.  Here's why:<p>a) A startup or a mid-sized company will usually act pretty fast in making an offer or informing the candidate they're declined.   The bureaucracy at bigger companies may mean it could be awhile before you hear back from them even if they liked you, but for the most part I felt silly sending thank-you letters after my employment at the company was already determined.<p>b) It's common to go on an interview loop and meet 4-8 people.  I found myself basically copy-pasting them same letter to everyone I had met and I felt really foolish.  The alternative was to think of something unique to everyone, but this felt equally contrived (""I really enjoyed those questions about how Perl handles multiple inheritance!"")<p>c) Business cards are pretty passe now and a lot of engineers don't get them at companies because they don't need them.  So I would ask the employees I would interview for their cards, they wouldn't have any, so I had to awkwardly quickly jot down their full name and e-mail address while the next interviewer was already walking into the room.  Or sometimes I would forget to ask, and then I'd e-mail the HR contact, and I doubt it ever got to the interviewer.<p>d) When I got older, I quickly realized I never made any difference to me as a hiring manager.  If I liked a candidate, I hired him.  If I didn't, I didn't hire him.  If I received a thank-you e-mail, it didn't make a lick of a difference.  I know it can demonstrate good communication skills, etc, but I already made my judgment on the candidate's communication skills in the 1 hour I spoke to him, not in the 15 seconds I took to read his thank-you e-mail.<p>e) At a company I interviewed at, I once sent everyone a thank-you e-mail, and then I was hired.  Somehow my personal e-mail address was made the default in everyone's Outlook address book for my name, and it was literally weeks until it was fixed.  Until then I had to keep checking my personal e-mail as well as my work e-mail.  This is obviously more a failure of Outlook or that company's IT department, but that was basically the last time I ever sent thank-you e-mails.<p>Look, it won't hurt.  If you're paranoid and getting a lot of 'old-school' advice, then go ahead and do it.  But seriously, at no point does a candidate's offer status hang in the balance on his thank-you note.  An interview debrief never ends with, ""well, sounds like we could really go either way on this guy... let's see if he's the kind of polite young chap that sends a thank-you e-mail.""<p>So good luck with the interviewing, and if you're concerned about coming off as polite and well-mannered, the best way to to express is it in the interview itself... not a contrived thank-you e-mail that the interviewer probably won't get anyway and won't influence his decision even if it does.",1285120674

They all write music, they all sell it to a company who makes a greater profit off of it, why? Because they can't sell a jingle for nothing, they can't make a sound track for a movie they don't own and own the music. So why does a musician assume they're special in this industry?<p>No upstart artist can afford to make 2 million+ albums for a debut hit, so they'd never sell 2 million albums and they could never be a hit, so they'd never chart and never get the free advertising and air time that hits are given, which means they wouldn't be getting the huge tours with stadium concerts. Artists inevitably as a <i>performing artist</i> make their money from their live <i>performances</i>, which the recording industry aims for. The more fans at a concert mean more record sales, which means more money in the record companies pocket, which means the artist gets more advertising, gets to charge higher ticket fees and make more money from their touring.<p>Given that so many big artists have established their own labels, they must be making their money <i>somewhere</i>.

1714863,comment,1714377,1714377,0,0,grellas,,,"I am late in joining this thread and will add only a few observations to supplement the many good comments already here:<p>1. Competitor collusion and express agreements to restrict the freedom of each to compete (i.e., horizontal contractual dealings) do indeed expose the colluding parties to potentially serious liabilities under the Sherman and FTC Acts. If that is what is going on here, then Mr. Arrington has fired a major warning shot to those involved asking, in effect, ""are you insane to let yourselves get caught up in this sort of activity?""<p>2. The irony here is that competitors are completely free to have contacts with one another, to discuss industry problems, and even to work on solutions for how best to handle such problems, <i>provided</i> that such contacts aren't made for an anti-competitive purpose. This is how trade associations work, among other things, and angel investors can and do meet all the time to discuss common issues and problems. Such benign meetings and contacts are very different from colluding to restrict their ability to compete freely in the marketplace through agreements to suppress valuations, etc.<p>3. Parallel action by competitors is in itself normally quite harmless and does not subject them to liabilities (for example, the fact that angel investors tend to use common sets of investment documents, tend as a group to dislike convertible notes, etc.). Companies having nothing to complain about legally from the fact that a particular angel investor happens to engage in practices in common with others in the industry that founders happen not to like. All this changes, though, if the competitors (i.e., the angel investors) have engaged in suspicious activities such as secret meetings among themselves to discuss overt ways to limit competition, etc.<p>4. Nothing under the law stops any one of these angel investors from deciding as a business matter to form a new fund along with others of such investors and to engage through that fund as a competitor in the venture financing industry. In such case, the investors are no longer competitors and have simply combined forces to compete as a different entity in the industry. If, however, the parties effectively remain competitors and simply form a jointly controlled venture whose aim is to serve as a vehicle by which they might collude in suppressing competition, that vehicle would be unlawful.<p>Putting all this together, the normal give and take among the myriad angel investors in the Valley and elsewhere is lawful and beyond reproach, even when they do meet to discuss problems. Meetings in a smoke-filled room as part of concerted efforts to restrict normal competitive activities by the participants, on the other hand, are almost blatantly illegal on the face of it and especially so when the participants are among the most prominent players in the industry.<p>It may well be that some or most of these participants hadn't really realized that they were moving from the benign to the illegal in participating in such meetings over time, and this is where it seems that Mr. Arrington is doing a good turn for them by calling them out before they do something that is irretrievably wrong. Just speculating on this last point but that is how the tone of the piece strikes me.",1285119788

The first time a checkin causes my machine to break, I don't know what caused it -- especially since there were 1,000 checkins since the last time I synced. I'm not even sure if it is a code change that messed up my system in some cases.</i><p>What you say is true.  But thanks to the Pareto principle, you find in practice that with well-factored software you need fewer tests than you'd imagine.<p><i>Once you have the regression test checked-in, that's great. But that's a small set of cases.</i><p>There are always cases nobody has caught yet.  But they take up much less time than you'd imagine.<p><i>""How many people do you think Google has checking code in?""<p>Maybe a couple of thousand checkins per day? Not sure how many users are doing it though.</i><p>Sorry, but I just giggled.<p><i>""That said, the rest of Google is a much more complex product which is under very rapid development.""<p>The reason I called out Android and Chrome is that I think they're fundamentally different than the rest of Google and much more like Windows. Why? Several reasons:<p>1) Cloud services are in some ways easier to test. You can test them on the cloud configuration they get deployed to. There is no single configuration to test Windows on. There's not ten configuration. There's not 1000 configurations. That new SSD HD, that new video card, audio card, CPU, chipset, tuner card, and combination thereof, are places where things can go wrong that you won't catch in the lab.</i><p>If you have well-factored abstraction layers, each of which has good unit tests for the abstractions it expects from below and for the abstractions it promises to export to above, the likelyhood of random combinations breaking things goes way down.  Sure, a random dangling pointer from one driver can scribble over random memory for anywhere else, but there are techniques for catching that type of mistake.<p>Also cloud services have similar challenges.  There are a lot of possible combinations when you release software in 40 languages which needs to support a wide variety of browsers on multiple operating systems with different configurations to users who have different preferences enabled.  It is not as bad as the number of combinations people run into with hardware, but it isn't a trivial challenge either.<p><i>2) Building on (1) is the fact that Windows/Android/Chrome are layered systems. If something breaks in the bottom layer, everyone above it is screwed. While I'm sure Google has some of that, like I would imagine a lot sits on GFS, the fact that it can be tested really well in isolation on a known configuration makes it a MUCH more tractable problem.</i><p>SOME of that?  I just giggled again.<p><i>But the guy who makes a breaking change in the SSD HD layer just screwed up the day for a chunk of people. Now the key here isn't that he broke everybody. That would certainly get caught in testing. The problem is that he broke 1% of the company or fewer. And someone else had a checkin that broke another 1% or fewer. And someone else had a different checkin that broke a different 1%. Given the number of checkins, you suddenly have 10% of the company who is trying to figure out what broke what.</i><p>Yes, I know the theoretical nightmare.  In practice it doesn't seem to be a problem.<p>In fact the smaller and more rapid the integration cycle is, the less overall pain there seems to be associated with them.  It isn't that you do 100 integrations with 1% of the pain each time.  It is that you do 100 integrations with 0.1% of the pain each time, which means your overall integration pain is a tenth of what it used to be.<p>Is there still integration pain?  Of course there is.  It is just less compared to what you are doing.<p><i>Android and Chrome would have the same problem, but at a smaller scale. The core of Google is probably pretty immune to this, as is Bing and the Bing Services team.</i><p>I strongly believe that you are over-estimating the natural immunity that Google has to this type of problem.  I cannot judge how Bing compares to Google without knowing things that I don't about how Bing is organized internally.<p><i>I just don't think you can a development model for cloud based web services and use it for a desktop product like Windows.</i><p>For an interesting public example, look at the LLVM project.  They produce critical software that OS X is dependent on, that operates in layers where each piece depends on the ones below it, that is multi-platform, and do it with developing on one branch with rapid integration.<p>Admittedly they are much, much smaller than Windows or Google.  But they give a public data point of interest.",1285119401

Unlike PhP, Java, etc. where just looking up stuff online is enough, unless you participate in the various local Ruby get-togethers or have some others nearby that do, you're likely to find yourself in the dark more than you're used to being. I'm somewhat of an introvert, and have a family where I can't be going to these things nor do I want to, but not going to the meetups definitely hurts it seems. Maybe I've bought into the hype too much about how much the meetups help though, and I've heard from someone that some meetups are more hype than help, so if you don't like one group, try another.<p>Basically, here are the pain points I can think of:<p>If you relied on it in the past, lack of static typing hurts in the beginning, but not so much after a year or so with the exception of lack of good method/etc. completion due to the dynamic nature of Ruby.<p>Having wierd bugs because the gem/plugin you are using is incompatible with the version of Rails, etc. is no fun. Read the docs associated with the gem/plugin. Submit a ticket/contact the developer(s) some other way to find out what they use. This doesn't bite as much as you'd think.<p>Trying to track down what in the heck is going on in Rails, Active Record, etc. can be a pain when something isn't working. I've not gotten good enough to feel totally comfortable with this, but I know people after working several years with it are more at home with this.<p>Upgrading Rails can suck.<p>You'll read suggestions that say if you don't write test first, you'll not be able to handle bugs/issues that well. That is probably true, however the team I'm on doesn't pay attention to testing as much as they should, and we get by mostly ok (some tough issues here and there).<p>Overall, Rails is ok, and Ruby is pretty cool.

This is also hard to detect automatically though, unless you want to take the NoScript route and block all force-cached images unless they meet a whitelist.<p>Web History: Extensions obviously have access to web history, though this is something that would vary from implementation to implementation of evercookie, so it would be fighting an endless battle, like spam email filters. The best fix here would be to close the css history hack hole.",1285117226

It makes you wonder how necessary it is for other companies when an internet-based company can keep it in the States.",1192337795

Negawatt proposals account for a large part of the problem, if you make distribution  efficient. And it can be made very efficient using superconducting lines.<p>For the brief periods where the world's overall wind production is low, if wind ever takes over most of the grid (it probably won't, considering the political dynamics), there is already a very effective storage technology -- liquid hydrogen. It has a practically limitless capacity (just add more tanks), and it avoids the toxicity problem of batteries, and it avoids the materials problem of fuel cells (still, nobody has found something cheap to replace platinum.)",1192337128

67560,comment,67407,67542,0,0,angryprofessor,,,"Some of the many worlds variants make sense. I prefer bohmian mechanics (I can reason about it better), but I have no objection to MW. Ultimately I don't care one way or the other: the predictions for MY universe are the same, whether or not it is unique or one amoung many. <p>However, the point I was making is that most physicists believe in wave collapse. The writer of the article was simply providing a reasonably good summary of QM with wave collapse. According to Q1 of your article, this is still a mainstream belief except amoung string theorists, apparently. I agree, it's almost certainly wrong. But that's not yet a mainstream position.<p>As for other non-ridiculous interpretations, just look at bohmian mechanics or GRW. Bohmian mechanics postulates that particles exist and are guided by the wave function. The testable physical predictions are identical to many worlds. GRW makes different physical predictions (possibly testable in the near future), but the theory makes sense as well.",1192334848

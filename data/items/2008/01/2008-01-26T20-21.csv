104717,comment,104696,104696,0,0,carpal,,,"I think you might be confused between Ruby and Rails.<p>Ruby's current version is 1.8.6, while 1.9 is nearing an official release and 2.0 is still very experimental at this point.<p>Rails' current version is 2.0.2, but the last release on the  1.x branch was 1.2.6.<p>I'm going to assume that you meant Rails 1.2.x versus Rails 2.x.  Yes, there are a lot of advantages.  Mainly though, there aren't really any disadvantages- there's no reason <i>not</i> to use Rails 2.0.",1201380782

If grep would return 100k and only 10 in the desired field awk is obviously handy (the exception).  In the general case where you are just trying to hunt things down who stops and counts which field their target string is in.  I could have run grep and analyzed the results by the time you count to the right field.  If you miscounted however... how do you know?",1201377754

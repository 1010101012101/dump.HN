786261,comment,785337,785595,0,0,azanar,,,"Buying apples for 1/10 the price isn't the part of the cycle that is most concerning. Nor is the part about firing 9/10 of the workforce -- although that assumes the company is operating at near 0% margins, and that the employment needs of the company scale linearly with total sales in dollars. Neither of these two are that common.<p>The thing that concerns me most is the lack of new jobs that absorb the redundant workforce. However, my concerns are probably somewhat unorthodox in that I think this represents a number of ideological problems rooted in both the employees and the employers.<p>The best way to encompass all of these is by the following truism: you are only capable of one specialization, give or take, in a given lifetime. And what we've been defining as specialization has been narrowing as rapidly as specializations have been getting deeper and more involved.<p>To play off of the analogy above, our society would look at these people, assert that it has no further need for ""apple preparation specialists,"" and discard this class of people into the bin of history. At best, they go through retraining in some new specialization, but that takes a long time, and they are considered entry-level in their new specialization at the end.<p>It is this mentality where you get the laundry-list of ""key proficiencies."" The unwritten assumption is that all jobs are <i>still</i> a matter of rote memorization and repeated execution of steps, and as the years of experience with a particular technology accrue, the unconscious memorization of these steps improves.<p>The problem with this approach is that it is completely wrong. We do not account for people's ability to deductively reason, and we therefore do not account for the parts of the new skillset they'll know without being told by someone. The tragedy is that people believe they can't: employers, recruiters, and even the employees. This last part is the most tragic. The rank-and-file employees who believe this philosophy are so common that I become animatedly excited when I meet one who doesn't.<p>So, yeah. I think it goes deeper than just saying there aren't any jobs; we should really be deeply analyzing what assumptions about the nature of skill and work ethic we've been falsely believing all this time. So far, most of the analysis I've seen has just been repetition of these assumptions, with calls that we psuh forward initatives that work around them.",1251247785

786249,comment,785477,785804,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"What you're saying makes sense, but it's also ignoring the part of the context. In my opinion, you make a good point, but an irrelevant one.<p>It's one thing to <i>be</i> an organic vegan hippie and a multimillionaire capitalist. It's another thing to use the platform afforded you in part by your customers to influence national policy in a way that conflicts with those customers' values and the perceived values attached to your company's brand.<p>I'm going to use an extreme example; hopefully it won't be so extreme as to be rendered irrelevant.<p>Suppose I run an organization, ""World Fish"", dedicated to preserving aquatic life in the world. My organization receives millions of dollars in donations every year and is successful at what it does. WF becomes a leading light of the ""aquatic life"" movement. Those who support aquatic life are proud to send money to WF.<p>Now suppose that in my country, a contentious bill regarding the ethical treatment of land-based animals (chicken, pigs, cows, etc) gets proposed by my government. The bill sparks weeks of debate and media coverage. Some see it as a moral victory, while other see it is another step toward ""socialism"" and governmental/societal decline. Then I, the figurehead of WF, decide to write an op-ed detailing my reasons for why this bill is a bad idea. It also details ideas I think will work, but which aren't the ""moral victory"" the bill's supporters are looking for.<p>Do you think that the people who've donated to WF for years are going to continue donating? Or do you think they'll feel betrayed? If these people value aquatic life enough to donate, they most likely value animal rights in every form. In their minds these values logically go together, and by giving money to me they likely never suspected I would try to influence public policy in a way they perceive to be harmful to one of their cherished values.<p>To bring this back to the real WF - this isn't just about the man and his opinions. It's about the values associated with the brand he's built, the nature of shopping at WF, and the context of this particular op-ed.<p>The WF brand is very strongly associated with morals. WF touts ethical treatment of people and ethical treatment of animals. As a consequence, shopping there (for some) is not just about price or quality of goods; it's a moral choice.<p>The people who are joining this boycott evidently feel that the public option is the moral choice for this country to make, and it falls into the same sphere of moral choices that Whole Foods is aligned with. Fair Trade is about treating people across the world with dignity and humanity; the public option is perceived as treating people in our own country with dignity and humanity.<p>It makes sense that these boycotters perceive betrayal when the CEO of a company that has become an extension of their identity opposes the values they thought they were supporting. It's not ""You don't like to eat animals therefore you must support a public option""; it's ""We bought from your stores, told our friends to shop there, invested in your idea, and helped make you rich and given you this platform, and now you're turning around and using that platform to betray our values - the values we thought you stood for."" Mind you I'm not saying I agree with this, I'm not saying whether this is objectively logical or not, I'm just trying to outline what I think are the boycotters' perceptions.<p>The final piece is the nature of this particular law. If the CEO come out again Net Neutrality (since it's governmental regulation), I doubt anyone would feel outraged enough to boycott WF. But health care reform deals specifically with the ethical treatment of people, something which WF is associated with.",1251247323

Charging money for your services and skills is not a bad thing.<p>I've rarely done software development contracting, but I spent several years as an IT contractor (with a lot of scripting, and simple web-based UI work to make it possible for non-technical people to carry on when I've gone).

I would build as generally as possible, retain ownership, and sell the result to many customers.  I wasn't very good at this for the first five years or so, however, and ended up doing a lot of development for pennies on the dollar.  I would talk to a potential customer, they'd say, ""We wish your products could do X and Y."" and I'd think, ""Yeah, I bet a lot of people would like that"", and would offer to provide it for some ridiculously low price ($199, or whatever) as a plugin for my existing product line...spend two or three weeks working on it (and sometimes money for icons, design, other developers, etc.) and then never sell another copy of that plugin.

786212,comment,785337,785337,0,0,fnid,,,"Here is the problem with this debate.  On one hand, people say, ""We need more H1B visas to handle the engineering workload in the U.S.  There aren't enough skilled americans.""   They also say, ""We must make engineering more attractive to Americans.  Stop focusing on sports, et al and focus on creating brilliant minds.""<p>Similarly, groups argue that outsourcing jobs is acceptable, another that it is not.<p>The problem is that we cannot have both.  You cannot convince students in america to invest 6 figures into their education if they know those jobs will be filled with immigrants or shipped overseas.   If there is no opportunity for jobs or an income that can absorb the investment in the education, then students will not enter that profession.<p>Technology employers in America argue that limiting H1B visas is stiffling creativity and the ability of companies in the U.S. to innovate.  If this is the case, rather than paying individuals from other countries less to do the same job, pay locals more to do the same job.  Give them more of an incentive to enter the work force. Value the work appropriately to the difficulty and investment level needed to complete the task.  Being an engineer is difficult.  Not everyone in the world, can, or wants to do it.  There has to be an incentive to perform these difficult tasks.<p>The reason that we need to curb H1B visas and the outsourcing of jobs is precisely for the same reasons that the employers say we need to increase them.  We need to curb them because we need america to remain more competitive.<p>There is a difference between America remaining more competitive and American corporations remaining more competitive.  The former means american citizens and our nation remains strong.  The later does not.  If, for example, we continue to increase H1B's and off-shoring of technical work, then the logical conclusion is that there are no longer <i>any</i> native born americans to fill these positions.  If this is the case, then America -- the nation -- is vulnerable to those countries with citizens and patriots to foreign entities who do have those skills.<p>This will leave America at an extreme disadvantage in the long run.<p>If engineers, who, arguably produce much more value to society than athletes or even CEOs were to earn as much money, the professions would be more popular.  Instead, we have individuals who could make lasting changes to the benefit of our infrastructure, our technology, and our culture are entering other fields because they are more lucrative and are more <i>appreciated</i> by our society.<p>If we continue to outsource the jobs, it is a big sign that those who perform these tasks are not really appreciated.  Engineers are not appreciated in America.  They are appreciated in other countries.  Compare our culture to Germany.  Germany appreciates technology savants and the result is evident in their current account.  Relatively speaking, they are the richest nation in the world.<p>And America is the poorest.",1251245634

<i>Before you pass on the right on multilane roads such as expressways, make sure you check your mirrors, use the proper signals for lane change, and look over your right shoulder for other vehicles. After passing, be sure to check over your left shoulder, and to signal, before returning to the left lane.</i>

My understanding is that the web app says, ""Hey, if you give us a URL, we'll POST (or GET, PUT, etc) these parameters to it whenever a certain event happens."" On your machine, you just set up a script at the URL. Then whenever someone you follow on Twitter tweets, for example, Twitter will POST user=blhack&tweet=My%20spoon%20is%20too%20big to the URL you gave them. That effectively gives you a push API instead of the conventional pull APIs.<p><a href=""http://webhooks.pbworks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webhooks.pbworks.com/</a>",1251245484

You can actually see it reversing if you watch King of the Hill: the earliest episodes generally show Hank as a small minded redneck, whereas later episodes portray him as a lone voice of sanity.<p>Anyways, if you look outside of comedies, there are plenty of masculine male leads in popular shows (Jack Bauer comes to mind.)  As for race, I can't even think of a popular drama where the male lead is black (and the other characters aren't.)  But maybe I just don't watch enough TV.",1251245345

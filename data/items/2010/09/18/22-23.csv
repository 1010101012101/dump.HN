For years, people have been overclocking cheap chips to make them run like the top end ones which shows there is little difference between them. Therefore price differentiation comes into to play so they can maximise their profit. It's similar to what Microsoft do with the different editions of Windows.",1284850795

It might well be that after spending considerable time and money on the new employee he's still not a very good match for the original tasks. Then you are stuck with a loss and an employee you can't fire (since, for example, the 'testing' period is something like 2-4 weeks -- this might depend on the country/state, etc.).<p>Or, training does work but the investment is usually so big (not just on the trainer but the lost productivity of the team members involved) that the employee would need to stay employed a number of months/years at least, to recuperate costs. So if the employee resigns before that (since he gets a better offer) you are still in the red.<p>I've personally had people work for me that didn't actually fit the task, but only because they were quite smart and I was certain they could pick up the domain (any domain) quite fast.<p>But right now, for example, I'm looking at CVs of student candidates and I'm reluctant to invest in their training because I have a small company and the risk of them leaving after they are trained is high.",1284850446

1705125,comment,1704907,1704907,0,0,wccrawford,,,"Eh...  Companies that produce widgets don't generally do so on demand.  They over produce when the demand is low, and then fill orders from storage when demand is high.  The average-ness averages out over time.  (Unless the demand is initially high and then falls, but that's a different conversation.)<p>But when dealing with programmers, it's a whole different scenario.  Let's run through the 5 programmers, 5 parallel tasks scenario again.<p>You give out 5 parallel tasks to 5 programmers and expect them to be finished in 3 days average.  That means some finish early and some finish late.  The ones that finish early don't sit on their hands.  They get another task, or they start helping one of the slower programmers, if possible.  (To be fair, the late task might not be because they are 'slow', but there might have been complications.  We aren't assigning blame here.)  There is never a situation where the demand for programming work is less than the supply when you're running a programming shop.  If there is, you'd let someone go until there isn't.<p>In programming, everything is late because people under-estimate.  Estimates have a built-in assumption that things go well, even when you try to estimate that things don't.  The only way to build-in estimates for problems is to badly over-estimate, and those would be useless estimates.  (Assuming, of course, that you don't already think they're useless.)<p>There are other factors, too, like wanting to please your boss with good numbers, etc...  But I don't think they're nearly as strong.<p>So things are always late because of estimates, not because of some 'flaw of averages' or something.",1284850022

1705085,comment,1705012,1705012,0,0,ggchappell,,,"> I wonder why this move away from on-the-job training has taken place.<p>> One reason given as to why firms have reduced their training is because they fear that after investing in the worker, he might just bolt to a competitor which may reward him with better pay because it didn't have to budget for training.<p>The underlying reason for this situation is a good question. While I don't know the answer, it should be noted that, once we have such a situation, it tends to be self-perpetuating. Workers have no incentive to be loyal to companies that won't be loyal to them, and vice-versa. The first one to try being loyal to the other, will often get burned.<p>So dealing with these problems means that we have to fight not only the underlying reasons for the situation, but also the self-perpetuating characteristics of the situation. Not easy.<p>Another note: HN has generally been rather down on the tenure system in American universities. While I agree that tenure has its problems, it does address some of the troubles you point out. Universities and professors (excepting those with temporary appointments) seem to me to be much less afraid to invest in each other than modern businesses and their employees are. Eliminating tenure may very well give significant benefits to universities; however, it also introduces the kind of problem that you are discussing.<p>EDIT: Still another note: A recent post (I <i>think</i> it was on HN) discussed alleged secret agreements among various tech companies to avoid hiring each other's employees. This is yet another unfortunate outgrowth of this situation.",1284848868

1705056,comment,1696071,1700970,0,0,lzw,,,"Thanks for your thoughts, and I don't disagree with the general philosophy you're pitching.  I think, though, you may be imagining something different than I'm trying to describe. It seems that you're thinking in terms of front end and back end servers and a cache that is seperate severs, which is why you suggest that the cache in the nodes serving the authoritative data should be sufficient.  I'm describing a system whereby there is only one server configuration and it contains the whole stack and thus to increase capacity you add more servers, which means more cache, more database capacity, etc.<p>This may be non-traditional, but it is amenable to an ec2 type of setup where you scale the cluster up or down without having to keep ratios of types of servers and their connections coordinated.  I don't intend to change the cluster size, except to slowly add more servers over time. But having different types means different configurations, and keeping it coordinated.  The idea here is, one type, it is already configured, it is actually an image and you just clone it.<p>Didn't realize that memecahced worked that way, I do need to look into it more, and thanks for the alternative recommendations.<p>There are some elements, like images that appear on every page, or CSS files, that will be served much more than others,  I can store all these elements in the couch, and maybe they will live in ram due to the systems virtual memory, making explicit caching pointless.  I will need to do tests here, you are right.<p>But I was going by some previous experience and common ""best practices"" advice to try and explicitly keep some of this in ram.  Further, I do want ot keep some operational state information in ram, so that it can be written often, even though it doesn't need to be persisted, but does need to be read by multiple machines in the cluster.<p>Anyway, I appreciate your suggestion, and agree with the desire to keep complexity down.  One of the ways I'm doing this is to have a single machine type, thus no complex heirarchy of machines that have to be configured to work with each other.  Just add additional nodes to add capacity.",1284847775

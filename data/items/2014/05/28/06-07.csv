In the mall, you choose the stores you go to and then look for the product there. You are explicitly entering different stores, and you have the obvious ability to return to that store. That builds affinity with the store.<p>With Amazon, the typical entry point is to search for the product you want.

And I think we&#x27;ll see small charging spaces that autonomous vehicles can use every block or so. Plus parking for these vehicles will be dense and save loads of space - it is obscene how much of our space is dedicated to parking.<p>I think we&#x27;ll also see something in between a typical commuting vehicle and a bus. If 10 people in a specific area have regular bookings to go from a two block area to the CBD in a fixed time, then a van will do pick-ups and drop-offs either from houses or from fixed corners (think unmarked bus stops). It will be like demand-based bus routes.<p>I think we might also eventually see pod-based vans for people that don&#x27;t want to socialise in any way with others in the vehicle. That said, people cope with the subway OK.<p>I don&#x27;t think pollution from driving will be a significant factor with a serious influx in electric vehicles.<p>2. That&#x27;s worse than what&#x27;s happening now. I think we&#x27;ll see peak pricing motivate changes in schedules and a decrease in the full complement of cars. I also think we&#x27;ll see companies selling time-share in vehicles so you might buy one of these cars to have priority access, but then earn money from whenever it&#x27;s available to work for you as part of a network. Those that want to keep one dedicated to themselves could.<p>3. Staff costs are significant in Australia so here and in similar places, I think taxis will be increasingly popular. Already it&#x27;s not far off the case that commuting via taxi outside peak times could be more affordable for me with a second car I use twice a day, twice a week. Four taxi trips would cost me $12-17 each ($2500-3500/year). My second car, ignoring the cost to buy it would reach $2500 annually from registration, insurance and maintenance. That ignores depreciation, cleaning, hassle of parking, walking to my parking spot in the rain four blocks away, etc. Take away salary costs of taxis and make them easy to hail and pay by phone and I&#x27;d switch so quickly. And I think many people would prefer to travel by autonomous vehicle than with a driver who smells, listens to crappy radio stations or answers their phone the entire trip.",1401259398

There&#x27;s a method for sharing just analytics with other Google Accounts, buried in the Site Analytics admin panel.<p>With that setup, the client will be creating a Site Analytics account within his <i>personal</i> Google account, and sharing said Site Analytics with <i>my</i> personal account. And I won&#x27;t be able to see, let alone delete or disable their search history.

So when that accounts gets to me, I delete & disable search history. I know <i>for a fact</i> no one who ever logged into this shared account intended to share their browsing history with people.<p>Exacerbating the problem is the fact Google accounts are intentionally designed so that you log in and forget you&#x27;re logged in. Google <i>wants</i> to know who you are. The accounts are also designed so that if you want a standalone account for analytics, it&#x27;s a full-blown Google account, so you end up with people&#x27;s search history in there (and a bunch of other services no one asked about, like email, docs etc.).

7808648,comment,7807991,7808444,5,0,User9812,,,"1. Not sure I agree with the first point. People hunting for a parking space once a day likely causes less pollution then a car driving itself to a charging station or depot twice a day. Plus, if these are an affordable method of commuting, you&#x27;re going to be pulling people away from public transportation, and getting more vehicles on the road. If they&#x27;re more expensive, then you&#x27;ll just have people buying their own, and then they&#x27;re in your situation, where they buy an SUV model since it&#x27;s more versatile.<p>2. Moving some depots outside the city will definitely help. Yes, some of the cars going into the city will be used for courier jobs, or tourist day trips, but that&#x27;s an incredibly small percentage. You might have 500,000 automated cars taking people to work. 450,000 sit in a depot waiting for the evening commute, and 50,000 are used for people active in the day. Once again 500,000 people take their car home, and about 450,000 sit idle again waiting for the next day. How does this work as a business? If you use one of these cars for work, you need to pay for 90% of the cost, because that car rarely gets used outside of taking you to and from work. Sure, you could do a ride share with a couple of other people, but still, the few of you are renting that car full-time. It doesn&#x27;t work.<p>3. If these can be solar charged, then surely a taxi can be solar charged, so there&#x27;s no difference in fuel cost. You&#x27;re paying a driver, and someone in an office answering calls, so there is an extra cost, and I think they have a use case here.<p>In short, these cars need to be on the road all day long, that&#x27;s how they lower their prices and raise efficiency. That doesn&#x27;t work for daily commuting. However, they would be an incredible taxi service. Imagine you have a fleet of 100 automated cars, people use an app to set their pickup/destination, and the cars find the most efficient way of organizing the routes and schedule. A car breaks down, and another one automatically reroutes itself. You could give people the option of carpooling with a checkbox. Let people register on the app, and upload a photo. So, you set your destination, and it says it&#x27;ll be $10 and 15 minutes, or you can carpool with John (25/male), and it&#x27;ll cost your $7.50, and 20 minutes. This could even happen while you&#x27;re in transit. You get a pop-up on the dash. Want to lower your rate and share a ride with the person in this photo? Say yes, we&#x27;ll credit $5 to your account, and take a 5 minute detour to pick them up. Worried about safety? You could review passengers, and only car pool with people that have a high rating and good feedback. I think that&#x27;s exciting, it should offer lower rates to consumers, and you get to socialize with new people at the same time, so you might make some friends on your next taxi ride.",1401258119

The PBKDF2 answer is quite satisfactory (though I think that these days 10k iterations is warranted).<p>What I&#x27;m much more concerned about though is the server-side encryption of the notes[1]. Having the notes encrypted with a key that&#x27;s kept on the same server, however frequently changes, adds barely any security. It gives the illusion of security: they can now truthfully say &quot;your notes are encrypted on the server, yay!&quot; But that&#x27;s disingenuous, because the keys are stored on the same server.<p>A much better system would be to encrypt the notes on the device, using a key derived from the password. That way, the server can never see the plaintext of the notes, except for during login and when the password is being changed[2].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://inessential.com/2014/04/17/vesper_sync_diary_14_keys"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inessential.com/2014/04/17/vesper_sync_diary_14_keys</a><p>[2]: This is actually pretty easy to get around, by not sending the plaintext password to the server for login, but rather a different password-derived key. But if it were built that way it&#x27;d make it a little harder to update all the notes when changing passwords. But again, you could fix that by simply storing an encrypted version of a randomly generated encryption key on the service, and simply re-generating that when the password is changed, without having to chain the note ciphertexts. Kind of like how OS X full disk encryption works.<p>I actually touched on this by mentioning it to Brent via twitter the other day: <a href=""https://twitter.com/kob/status/471152663384440832"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/kob/status/471152663384440832</a>",1401258052

Common wisdom these days (among many people at least) is that the architecture (ISA) doesn&#x27;t matter too much w.r.t. power, as compared to the microarchitecture. The reason is that modern implementations translate whatever quirks exist in the ISA into a fairly uniform set of underlying micro-ops; an out-of-order superscalar implementation of x86 and ARM will look pretty similar. (Go read Bob Colwell&#x27;s book on P6/Pentium Pro, the first out-of-order x86, for some more insight on this.)<p>The conflation of ARM/low-power and x86/high-power is a historical thing: x86 started on desktops and moved downward, while ARM started in embedded systems and moved upward. It&#x27;s becoming less true as each heads toward the same target (mobile). Remaining differences in efficiency are mostly functions of implementation choices and engineering quality.<p>Big disclaimer: I worked at Intel after doing grad school in computer architecture, so I may be slightly biased. :-)<p>[1] E.

Even though his comment is a legitimate currency conversion remark. See: <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=1+usd+in+yen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=1+usd+in+yen</a><p>2) He explains that clearly you&#x27;re mistaken (which, really, seriously, what a kneejerk response from someone who just wanted to show how clever they were, calling out an &quot;asshole&quot;) and further explains his account isn&#x27;t even a &quot;throwaway&quot; in the traditional, trolly sense of the word, citing his account age and the fact that he regularly actively posts to the account.<p>3) You, caught perhaps in a moment of clarity, though I think I give you too much credit here, realize you were too eager to pounce on the &quot;asshole&quot; for his &quot;Yen&quot; remark, and perhaps you misread it. Your latent erection fading, you counter by explaining that your history and karma are even _more_ impressive, somehow completely avoiding taking responsibility for a completely nonsensical leap in logic and accusation of wrongdoing, while doubling down on your cognitive dissonance.<p>4) The Aristocrats!",1401257250

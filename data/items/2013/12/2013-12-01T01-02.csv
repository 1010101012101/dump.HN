For now at least, most voice will still be served over fairly long loops from the CO - AT&T is rolling out VoIP over U-verse - Verizon is doing the same over FiOS, CenturyLink has not yet marketed VoIP to residences - but I suspect it will come in a while (when more of their footprint is covered). Fiber to the Node has the advantage of having fiber near the customer when the cost of repairing the legacy copper exceeds the cost of putting fiber in to each house.<p>Largely, based on my research - the new VoIP circuits are often being served off TDM offices that have upgraded been to packet switching. Both Lucent and Genband offer a way to upgrade their TDM switches to a packet based core (Lucent 7ESS or 7 R/E and Genband C15 Session Controller).<p>In short - the article was full of hyperbole - If you look at the underlying blog post - it doesn&#x27;t mention the removal of copper, copper will play a big part in last mile service delivery for likely another 20-30 years - in the end is about replacing the TDM based network core with packet switching - a process that has been going on for almost 20 years at this point. With proper engineering a packet based system is every bit as (if not more) reliable as TDM based one.<p>That said, it raises some real questions - what of universal service? How about the CLEC market - will they be granted access to the new networks which are replacing the old?<p>Only time will tell.",1385863094

Any estimate is doomed to fail in the face of all these poor assumptions.<p>Staggering a software project into smaller chunks goes a long way to controlling these poor assumptions and the impact to schedule and, more importantly, customer expectations.<p>The principles of the agile manifesto go a long way for mitigating the too common pie-in-the-sky wishful thinking that dominates software engineering.

Every tragedy is made public, and the more grave and more egregious, the more media coverage it gets.  People grow up believing that child abductions are the norm, and even likely, when the reality is that stranger abductions are less likely than they&#x27;ve ever been -- but the Amber Alert system (at least in the DC area here) broadcasts on highways, making it impossible to believe that a kid isn&#x27;t abducted every two seconds.<p>Humans are built to be paranoid.  Historically, the person who heard a strange noise outside their shelter and didn&#x27;t react was mauled by a bear, or lion, or what have you, while the more alert human that took to defensive measures was more likely to survive.  Having established our positions as apex predators, in cities this is far less likely to be needed, but our brains still seek danger patterns, cling to them, and those instincts aren&#x27;t able to be quashed by rationality or statistics.  We see something like the Newtown shooting and instinctively feel that all our children are in immediate danger, despite its actual unlikeliness.  The media catches another school shooting and reinforces it even more in our brains that there is a very real danger, and breeds distrust and paranoia, triggering an instinct to be even more isolationist, and more paranoid, breeding more and more distrust, which further fuels the cycle for the next news article we see reinforcing our beliefs.<p>This isn&#x27;t meant to blame the news, or humans, or any particular person at all, but the idea is that we should all at least attempt to be more data-driven, more pragmatic, and to try and find data that doesn&#x27;t agree with our assumptions.  It&#x27;s harder than it sounds.  In most humans, the brain simply rejects data that doesn&#x27;t agree with its pre-formed hypotheses, but scientists are better equipped here than the average human, as we revel in data, enjoy being proven wrong, and strive towards better results, not just a reinforcement of the bad data we already believe.",1385860604

In this case the user table would also probably have ids/references to the various government backend systems that the site used to verify your identity, income, etc as you signed up.<p>The rest of it sounds like they botched making this system scalable, to handle both the number of possible users (every adult in the US) and the rate at which they&#x27;d be signing up. &quot;Endless technological loops&quot; might refer to either a circular reference in an overly-complex schema, or to normal dependency checking in the schema which takes too long to evaluate within the database when the database is under enormous load.",1385860592

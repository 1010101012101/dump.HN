It seems that the submitter is trying to imply that Ms. Pao is hiring in a way that is discriminatory (i.e., that would make it harder for people of some gender or race to join the company).  The full context of the quote is:<p>> Ms. Pao, who said she wants to stay long-term as Reddit’s CEO when a one-year interim period ends, said she has removed salary negotiations from the hiring process because studies show women don’t fare as well as men. She has brought in well-known Silicon Valley diversity consultant Freada Kapor Klein to advise the company.

The logic goes, a parliamentarian was paid $1m a year rather than $200,000 a year, you might actually attract the best talent of society, and when you&#x27;re paid $1m a year, a $100k bribe at the risk of losing your position seems much less enticing.

9332083,comment,9331597,9331887,0,0,notduncansmith,,,"Xcode is a decent tool for new programmers.  Also, features like Cmd+Click (go to definition) can be a huge boon when dealing with an unfamiliar codebase.  That said, for anyone used to using &quot;text editors&quot; (Sublime, Vim, Emacs, etc) it is sorely lacking.  I&#x27;m not afraid to say that text editing in Xcode is barely more tolerable than a standard web textarea in that respect.  It&#x27;s sluggish, prone to crashing (or losing syntax highlighting), and often displays errors in the middle of typing an expression (which linger for a bit until the inline parsing catches up with the entered text, a process that may take several seconds).  This, coupled with the limited text-editing ability, make it very painful to use coming from a text editor.<p>In my personal opinion, the worst part of the iOS development experience is the fact that one is forced to use Xcode to get any clear preview what the app will look like, or to set up connections between a view and the viewcontroller code.  One can of course lay out views programmatically, but that process is hilarious verbose and the slow build times make the workflow infinitely more painful than say, HTML+CSS (where one can get sub-second feedback on code changes). This makes any sort of visual/UX work on iOS incredibly painful.<p>P.S. If anyone has any tips on how to mitigate either of these pain points, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it!  I fully admit that I&#x27;m not an expert and may be overlooking some critical feature that would erase these pains.",1428382314

Then it is easy to imagine a &#x27;remove&#x27; operation on a &#x27;branch&#x27; will remove all the commits in that &#x27;branch&#x27;. There is no ambiguity.<p>But when you define a branch as &#x27;a pointer to the last commit in a consecutive set of commits&#x27;, a &#x27;remove&#x27; operation on a branch is no longer clear what it is supposed to do.<p>Does it simply deletes the pointer, in which case the commits will remain untouched? But it would not be consistent with the abstraction of the &#x27;branch&#x27;.<p>Does it remove all the child commits from the history? by which the operation would be consistent with the abstraction of a &#x27;branch&#x27;.<p>Now the remove operation is ambiguous as to what it actually does.<p>Note that there would be no ambiguity if the user does not know that a branch is actually a pointer to a commit. Because git hides all the change-sets that are not the decedents of a branch. So a users concept of a &#x27;branch removal&#x27; is maintained. But I think it is pretty accepted that using git requires that you know stuff like these...<p>So another way of looking at the problem is that, Git forces the user to work at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously.

The branch would be created implicitly by having a revision with two or more children. It does not have to carry a name; naming revisions (or sets of revisions) is an orthogonal concept for the purpose of navigating the revision DAG [1], whereas in Git branches have the additional purpose of keeping revisions from being GCed. Any revision that is not referenced by a ref (directly or indirectly) will eventually be GCed (once it is removed from the reflog and the grace period has expired).<p>> It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me that they&#x27;re a byproduct of having a garbage collector<p>It is a byproduct. Because if you did the above in Git (which Git won&#x27;t let you without being explicit about it, but it&#x27;s possible), then one or the other child would get GCed sooner or later. That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s only one HEAD commit, and that can prevent only one child from being GCed, so you have to create a ref to the other (generally via a branch) to keep it alive.<p>> since (1) git-stash exists [...] and (3) git-clean honestly seems tacked on rather than a core piece of the design.<p>This has nothing to do with git stash or git clean.

It&#x27;s hard to respond quickly when everyone is emailing spreadsheets.<p>Adoption of tech in ag has been slow, in part, because farmers are already <i>very good</i> at their jobs.

The water is running out, there&#x27;s a huge labor shortage, and every farm employee now has a smartphone.<p>If we can spend the next year or two getting farm operational data online then there is a huge amount of value that can be unlocked with even relatively simple algorithms (not to mention deep learning etc.)<p>In fact, we don&#x27;t really have any other choice.

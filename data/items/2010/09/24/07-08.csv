I'm sure none of them are genuinely bad guys.</i><p>In other words, the point of them being ""genuinely bad guys"" or not is whether the affair should be allowed to blow over after a few firm but loving reproaches.  staunch and cookiecaper are both speaking in the same terms, on the assumption that only ""bad guys"" need to be punished harshly, because non-""bad guys"" want to behave well and just need a mild wake-up call now and then.<p>Rejecting the concept of individual people with persistent qualities forces you to argue in different terms, but it doesn't necessarily change the result of the argument.  So let's talk about punishment from the opposite orientation:<p>People exist in complex fields defined by their personal relationships and social institutions.  People tend to engage in behavior that results in comfort, advancement, and social approval, they and tend to avoid behavior that results in deprivation, loss of position, and loss of social capital.  Harmful behavior is controlled by ensuring that personal relationships and social institutions punish bad behavior instead of rewarding it.<p>In this case, that means society should find out what these people did, enforce any laws against it, and (in the case of people who know them and work with them) shame them with disapproval and show an aversion to dealing with them.  Otherwise bad behavior will flourish and affect more people.  We do not want to be responsible for tempting people to behave in ways that are injurious to others, because aggressive, selfish behavior harms those who engage in it as well as their victims.  If we, as a society, do not inflict just punishment on those who harm others, then aggressive, selfish behavior will increase, and there will be more suffering for both victims and aggressors.<p>tl;dr:  Rejecting the idea of ""genuinely bad guys"" leads to the conclusion that they should be punished <i>regardless</i> of whatever personal characteristics might be ascribed to them.",1285314227

I knew <i>absolutely nothing</i> about making circuits, so I spent the large part of a summer troubleshooting all sorts of minor things (it took forever just to get a blinking light, without toasting it, for example), scrounging for parts at Radioshack (what a rip-off!) and various online catalogs.  I bought enough parts to make 10, but after making 1 of them, the thrill was over.<p>Anybody I show this thing to is instantly amazed.  About 10% of people can actually figure out how it works.  And, in general, if they don't understand it before having it explained to them, they won't understand it afterword (though they will claim to ""get it"").  Maybe I'm just not good at explaining the strobe effect.  When people first see it, they momentarily believe that I've managed to create some sort of anti-gravity device.  Then when they see it going backwards, they sort of lose grip of reality for a moment.  It's amazing.<p>My time fountain kicks the original one's ass.

It wouldn't have to mmap the file because the user code never touches the file data.  This is probably why other OSes that support sendfile don't have this restriction.<p>>If you don't allow mmap the system will certainly have to copy between kernel and user memory<p>Why?  All the kernel has to do is set the DMA location for the drive to be a kernel buffer and follow any inodes when the file is split up on the disk.  The NIC driver can just be told to load the data from those locations directly so no kernel copying at all, much less into user space.",1285312316

I'm not sure who 'engineered' the streets, but one car can stop a swarm of traffic, and the speed limits are many times ridiculously low i.e. 35mph on a two lane street in a non-residential area, high visibility, and no intersections within 2mi.<p>This is a broken system in which much of my time is wasted daily, and the ""green wave"" is not the system's goal. It's nice to see some people experimenting to find better ways to regulate traffic. It should be obvious that 90% of the time the current flow is not the calculated daily average.<p>After all, Since when do 50,000 cars/hour drive on a street at 2am?",1285312278

That's why I said ""I'm not sure he's understanding what this is."" instead of just assuming the person had no idea what they were talking about.<p>>The read(2)/write(2) solution from userspace would involve no copying as well<p>I don't believe this is the case as at all.  First you have the context switch problem and second of all the reason sendfile can be fast is because it's possible that the kernel <i>never</i> touches the data.  It just assigns the disk DMA to a kernel buffer, and then gives the kernel buffer location to the NIC driver to read from.  All data reading and writing can be done completely with the hardware with no CPU involvement.<p>read/write can't do it this way because you have the option of doing something with the data you get back from read.  Well, it could optimistically hope that nothing will in fact be done with the data but that assumption will be wrong in nearly every single usage.",1285311940

It feels a bit stupid, but it's worth of it: ""Our price is $100 per hour, but as we need a good show case project, we are ready to this for $60 per hour.""<p>One other thing.

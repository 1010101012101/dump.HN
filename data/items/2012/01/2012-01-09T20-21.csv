You can still call, send a letter, show up at a door, grab a bite to eat, get some drinks, take a walk in the park, play stickball in the street.  It's up to <i>you</i> to maintain close relationships. Granted, it's impossible to have ""1430"" close friends like on FB, but it's not bad having a wider, loose connection with thousands of people ontop of that.<p>Also, it's still up to you to call your mom, meet up with old old friends once or twice a year, go out to your hometown bar the night before Thanksgiving. Facebook doesn't take away those ""moments you'll never remember with the friends you'll never forget.""  It just lets you keep in touch with those who might otherwise have dropped off the face of the earth.  Don't blame some ""social media"".  Also, kids these days, are just kids, let them socialize, it's probably not any worse than video games or TV, and you can't stop adolescent girls from gossiping, even if you take away their text messaging.",1326142753

Maybe they're slightly distracted from their original mission statement, and maybe this results in a slightly lessened desktop experience, but someone has to pay the bills. Maybe they'll even turn a profit. I'd certainly love to see them grow and flourish as a company.

There are some methods that need to be part of the class and carried around with the instance so that things like polymorphism work. But many operations work perfectly fine without. By making those lexically scoped, you avoid the problems of monkey-patching and method collisions. Extension methods are fantastic for this.<p>Also, for kicks, Magpie:<p><pre><code>    def (items) filterMap(callback)

                else nothing

Secondly, Microsoft has a long history of trying to keep users and developers hooked on their platform. As a programmer if you learned on Windows then switching to another OS for development can be a challenge. Depending on the programmer that challenge may be enough to keep you on Windows as its the path of least resistance to you.<p>I can't completely blame them however. If in an alternate universe Windows had a Unix heritage along with other popular OSes and Linux was the odd man out then we'd be saying the same things about Linux distros that we say about Windows now. I prefer every OS but Windows for a lot of reasons one of which is the same as the reason why my hypothetical programmer chooses Windows over other platforms. On any Linux or OS X machine I have a development environment up and running smoothly in a short time with minimal glitches but Windows makes things very hard for me.

Otherwise the state will make sure that you can only sell to licensed individuals and will also make sure that those guns won't be cheap.<p>To manufacture guns you need the materials required, like steel, wood, ceramic, ABS plastic and so on and you need to get them cheaply. To produce them cheaply you also need a heavily automatized factory that accommodates lots of processes like forging, stamping, milling, welding, riveting, casting and drilling. You can also outsource work, but to produce cheap guns you're better off controlling the whole stack. Of course, you could steal or buy those guns from the black market, like from the former Soviet Union arsenal, but doing so implies that you have connections and money to bribe people. Supply is also limited. And the risks are higher, since there are always people looking for those missing guns. So you're better off building your own factory, which of course has to be shielded from the local authorities (more bribes).<p>To distribute guns, you need a distribution network. And because illegal distribution is illegal and leaves traces, such a line of work is very high-risk. Like, you can always hire junkies to do the street-level distribution for a small price, but junkies are often getting caught by the police and then become valuable witnesses. Lots of mobsters got caught because of junkies. Also, if you want to cross the borders of a country with your merchandise, then things get really complicated. So if you want distribution on a massive scale, then it isn't going to be without a high price.<p>Compare to the Internet: communications can be encrypted with no way to eavesdrop without the key, it has very few single points of failure (e.g. DNS) and eavesdropping on peer to peer communications is a bitch, all this while copying and distributing has an absolute zero cost and can be done on a freakishly big scale.<p>4 days ago I wrote an article on my personal blog ~ 10,000 people viewed it in a single day, even though I'm a nobody. When you, as an individual, will be able to showcase your guns to 10,000 people in a single day, then it will be an apples to apples comparison (and you could use the Internet for that, but distribution and availability is location-dependent, you can't just click ""download gun"").",1326140068

They are worried about waiting months for a requested change to make it into production and not having it be exactly what they wanted/needed.<p>Managers often have a belief that programming should be unnecessary and there should be some way to drag and drop functionality into their applications.  For example anybody who implements simple email capabilities into their web app will soon have users demanding to know why it does not have a spellchecker , contacts database , spam filtering , mail merge , mail folders etc etc (basically everything that MS outlook has)<p>This conflict leads to problems where business will ask for what they feel should be a simple change and will want it working by the next business day. The technical team will take this change and promise to include it in the next large update. For example the small change may interface with parts of the system that are undergoing bigger changes upon the next release.<p>Developers do not want to mess up their code base doing these half assed changes without proper testing so they attempt to anticipate everything that might be required and simply add more and more options to their program making it increasingly complex.<p>When this becomes too much to manage they will eventually create a small DSL or a ""rules engine"" of some kind. This starts off simple enough that the secretary can use it and everyone is happy since the developers get their nice codebase as seperate from the messy code developed by the users.<p>Of course this rules system becomes more and more complicated in itself and it becomes a full time job to maintain this rules engine while more and more of actual live code is being written by people who have a baptism by fire introduction to programming as well as no testing facilities or version control.<p>Eventually the developers have to step in , view the programming atrocities that have been created in the higher level engine and somehow re-integrate it all back into the original codebase and start again.<p>Basically you are moving the mess out your area of responsibility and moving it to someone elses. 
This isn't always a bad idea provided you limit the power of the rules system and make sure expectations are clear as to what it will be able to perform.",1326139526

This is actually basically a good thing, I think, because it means that switching from one GUI client to another isn't a big deal.<p>Furthermore, it's possible that the real reason so much of the unofficial Git docs just talk about the command line rather than point you at a GUI client (except for documentation for those clients themselves of course) is that the Git GUI clients are still under so much development and in some cases are really lacking basic features (for instance, last I checked, the TortoiseGit client did not support any way of interacting with the index/staging area, which is a pretty important part of Git).<p>I think the parting words of the tutorial ""Git from the bottom up"" described Git as a library for building a version control system, or something like that, and suggested that we have only just begun to see what people can do with it.

5402057,comment,5401374,5401808,4,0,dougmccune,,,"I'm involved in academic publishing, and this is exactly what will happen. Publishers will simply stop selling the cheaper international versions. Those cheaper prices aren't sustainable, they only exist because the investment in the book is already made up for by the US/first world market. The cheap international pricing is subsidized by the more expensive markets and the international sales don't (historically) cannibalize the US/European sales. If that changes and the international copies flood the US market the international copies will simply stop being created. They aren't (economically) worth doing on their own.<p>You can complain about publishers all you want, but the net result of this change will simply be less affordable textbooks sold to the developing markets. Maybe that's just a short term result and new entrants will figure out how to profitably target the developing world with high quality material, but the short term affect will be a decrease in those low-cost editions sold overseas.",1363712227

If the computation is good to 0.001, (based on a detailed error propagation analysis of the algorithm against the expected input range), then I would use an epsilon of 1/512 when comparing against an int. The idea is that with a coarseness at that level the compiler rounding would likely have little effect. The comparison number would be (int + a power of two). But it sounds like for your scenario a scaled int or a rational would be more appropriate.<p>If you have access to a university library, (most universities will let you sign in and browse), is Chapter One of Stoer and Bullrish text Introduction to Numerical Analysis.

You say ""the resolution is far beyond what the human ear can discern"" as though that were undisputed science, which I should simply have looked up. But that is not the case.<p>You listen to two recordings of a high-hat. One CD, and one high quality analog such as pristine vinyl. And then you tell me you cannot discern the compression on a cd in comparison to vinyl. It's in the highest frequencies that the redbook cd format creates the most audible distortion. (Vinyl has issues too, obviously - but different ones.) But nobody could reasonably claim that redbook CDs are undistorted while vinyl is distorted. Both formats distort sound.<p>If you can't hear the difference, that's fine, but let's not pretend it is a scientific fact that CDs are somehow ""accurate.""<p>Edit: to be clear, I am not talking about frequency (highs and lows), I am talking about frame-rate. And I'm not talking about what is theoretically possible in ""digital sound reproduction"" I am talking about what is implemented in the standard format for audio CDs sold today.<p>Regarding reel-to-reel, I bet you're right!

5401982,comment,5400055,5401732,2,0,fecak,,,"Points well made, and in my position I'm able to argue both sides on this one.  I should probably preface my comments with the fact that I have done contract work in the past, but for the last couple years I've focused almost entirely on permanent placement, and part of the reason is this lack of trust between coders and recruiters and this whole dialogue.<p>In perm placement the incentive of the recruiter is usually to maximize the coder's income (fee = n% of salary), but contract placement is the opposite (margin = bill rate - pay rate where minimizing pay rate leads to higher margin).  I don't remember ever being accused of gouging by any coder as our margins were pretty low relative to others, but I would hate to have to explain/argue in the real world to a coder why my ability to negotiate a ridiculously high rate deserves to be rewarded (and as I said earlier, I'd split the reward, but I don't feel splitting at a flat rate is fair to the recruiter).<p>You seem to be downplaying the value of the negotiation work just a bit in my view, and you say as much at the end with the 'we all know...one of those tasks is far easier and more common than the other'.  You say you are not writing off the value of negotiators, and competition should mean that there are no huge deltas, but as long as you are truly getting at or above market rate I'm not sure I can see the fault in a recruiter getting a huge delta.<p>You are correct in that I can't do what coders do, and I can do things that coders can't do also.  On a site like HN, frequented by coders, everyone here will agree that what coders do is far more difficult than what recruiters do.  There is not point in arguing that, particularly here where most people seem to equate recruiting with the lowest form of humanity.  But I can assure you that I help people get jobs and solid comp packages that probably lacked the tools to do it on their own.  It's a symbiotic relationship with many of my candidates, at least in my case.<p>You keep alluding to the fact that if I negotiate a huge delta that it is a function of your naivete - couldn't it be the naivete of the company that is paying that rate?  If you pay $200K for a car that can be had for $20K elsewhere, you as the buyer are the 'victim' if there is one (certainly not the car).  Of course cars don't care, but hopefully you get my point.<p>Who is the true victim here if a coder is being fairly compensated based on market rate?  The victim, if there is one, is the company that is being overcharged - yet the coder seems to think he/she is the victim when they are being paid a fair wage.<p>Again, we stress coders need to know market rate, and the ones that are 'victimized' are the ones that don't know market rate.  They are victimized by recruiters who gouge.  But if the coder is getting market rate, and the recruiter is able to negotiate a higher-than-market hourly rate (with a high delta), you seem to believe that the coder is a victim - it's not the coder, it's the company.",1363711598

If the person is actually offline, you should be able to rely on the other server to actually deliver the message when they get back. I don't think XMPP has very good systems for ensuring reliable message receipt at the protocol level. There are, I understand, draft standards (XEP-0198, XEP-0013) that would improve things but nothing implements it (at least consistently).<p>File transfer: Clients I've used are Adium, Pidgin and Google Talk. What normally happens with file transfers is that either the person at the other end doesn't know I've tried to send a file, or if they do know, they click accept and the file never transfers, or if the file does transfer, my client somehow doesn't realise and the file transfer stays active forever. Usually there'll be a double-NAT in the way. The only time it does mostly work is GTalk to GTalk.<p>Multi user chat: Is very confusing to set up, and while it is possible to get it working, in practise I've found nobody can figure out how to use it. It's sort of like the complexity of email multiplied by the complexity of IRC.  This is unlike other chat protocols/clients where it's just a matter of inviting someone to your conversation.<p>This isn't even getting into the other issues with the protocol, such as voice/video/sip/o-o-b stuff, the general efficiency of the protocol and it's applicability to mobile users (It's not great).

Some of the older players (Sentai Filmworks does a lot of this) will split a license with Crunchyroll, so one has retail and the other streaming.

I didn&#x27;t, but he seems to like it. The company I&#x27;m at once interviewed a programmer who was working for Home Depot.<p>The reality is there are actually plenty of programming positions that are perfectly suited for a career programmer who doesn&#x27;t particularly love it and just wants a steady paycheck and a decent home life. But these positions aren&#x27;t at Google or Facebook or the hottest Silicon Valley startup, and they&#x27;re not going to ever pay $150k+ or even $100k+ (they might start at half that). You don&#x27;t need to know what a suffix tree is. You don&#x27;t need to have ever heard of bloom filters. These positions probably aren&#x27;t at many of the companies posting in the 37signals job board, because that board is naturally going to attract job seekers who are more enthusiastic about programming as both a craft and a means to a paycheck.<p>I think a lot of posters here seem to be wanting too much in exchange for too little. In every industry, it&#x27;s always been the case that the top companies have tried to hire the most &quot;passionate&quot; employees--and yes, that means employees who might work overtime while smiling about it. I don&#x27;t think this is so evil when there are plenty of other choices.<p>I do think it&#x27;s a bit disingenuous, though, to want to be part of the next explosively successful company while still putting in the minimum effort to get a steady paycheck. This forum is disproportionately full of people wanting to get at least somewhat wealthy off of software development, people who want the same compensation as big firm attorneys and doctors. Those lawyers probably work more than the average over-worked programmer at a top company, and the doctors almost certainly do. The attorneys and doctors also all necessarily went to graduate school and probably took on a lot of debt that the average programmer doesn&#x27;t have.

What happens in this instance?  It&#x27;s the biggest risk you need to look at from what I can see at first glance.  Perhaps test this.<p>Fourthly, is there a difference between a gift card and reward card?  Coincidentally we just bought a reward card today for our startup (we drink lots of coffee).  It looks like it has a similar number format as a gift card, and the Starbucks FAQ says they can refund a balance from the moment it&#x27;s reported as stolen/lost:\n<a href=""http://www.starbucks.co.uk/customer-service/faqs/card"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.starbucks.co.uk/customer-service/faqs/card</a><p>Fifthly, become aquainted with the law.  Gift cards in the UK at least are considered as &quot;Like cash&quot; as far as I am aware.  This means you could be setting yourself up for a bit of legal trouble down the line if you are considered a transmitter or money or such.  As other posters point out, the reason for your early success could be because you are being used as a money laundering service without you being aware of the fact.<p>And a question, what exactly are you doing with all these cards?  Selling them on somehow?  Or keeping them?<p>If this is too much risk/pressure for you, and you feel out your comfort zone, consider selling it as is for BTC.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find a buyer for a good sum.  If you like risk, want to make some money then good luck!  Let the adventure begin.  Although it sounds like as soon as you get any volume and Starbucks catches wind you&#x27;d be pretty easy to shut down.  That&#x27;s one of the better outcomes for you as well I think, the legal risks sound significant.  If it was mine, I&#x27;d look for a quick sale and pass the risk on.",1391185761

They are armed groups of civilians that took control of entire towns and their surrounding areas, to stop the cartels from doing as they please.<p>They have gunfights with cartels and when they successfully drive them away, they pickup armored vehicles, guns and money, and everything else the crime groups leave behind.<p>The situation is so delicate that not even the army wants to try to fight these groups. They are negotiating and having meetings and all (I&#x27;m guessing the social cost of just obliterating these groups is too high; we are talking about 3 thousand armed people ready to get into action in 15 minutes, that&#x27;s a lot of guns and civilians that you just can&#x27;t bomb away with no repercusions. Not that the government can&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s too pollitically and socially costly), but the army nor the police or any other government authority have control of those areas. I believe that&#x27;s a notch above improvised forts in the city&#x27;s streets.<p>So, my point is not to compare both conflicts as if one was &quot;above&quot; the other, both problems are nasty and very bad things that are happening right now, however like someone said in a similar story posted days ago, this is not a political forum to the extent where it has nothing to do with technology or hacking, in any sense of the word, unless you want to consider social protest as a form of &quot;government hacking&quot; or &quot;societal hacking&quot;, but then not only one country&#x27;s conflict should be posted, but conflicts from all over the world.<p>I&#x27;m guessing part of this trend of having social and political issues popping up in technology news sites (HN, Slashdot, etc) is that, as would be expected, social unrest is highly tied to communication technologies such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc, and that overlap is what brings social unrest news to the frontpages of techonology-related sites. The most obvious example I can think of is the conflicts in Egypt and how they came to be.<p>But alas, I think my point still stands in that Ukraine&#x27;s conflicts are in no way (that I can see) more related to techonology news, than say Mexico&#x27;s conflicts, and those haven&#x27;t been covered in HN, so I fail to see what is so special about Ukraine that gets to be posted several times in the past few days.<p>Maybe someone can enlighten me on this? I don&#x27;t intend to underestimate what&#x27;s happening there or to dismiss the conflicts, but I, like someone else already said, don&#x27;t come to HN for political news, unless they are somehow related to technology (NSA antics, Wikileaks, etc)",1391185167

You personally might benefit from having a lower cost of living, for whatever reason, but your employer never sees this.  All they see is the value you provide when you are at work.  If two people offer the same value, they will offer the same wage, regardless of the cost of living of those individuals.  Now the person with the higher cost of living might find this wage too low, and be forced to take a job with more hours/stress in order to achieve the income they require, or to adjust their lifestyle.  But none of these things change what a company is willing to pay.<p>The rest of your post is premised in the idea that firing someone is inherently immoral.  It is not something that should be taken lightly, since there are big adjustment costs for both sides, but as I said before, it only moves a person to their next-best option.  The action of firing someone shouldn&#x27;t be viewed as depriving them of a job for life* (which is made up for by a virtuous company providing them with a job for life).  The same argument applies to many other cases.  A school teacher cannot say &quot;if it weren&#x27;t for me, these children would have had no education, see how valuable I am&quot; because if it weren&#x27;t for that teacher, someone else would have done the job.<p>*Here life = the average time a person spends at a company and the argument remains the same.",1391184077

4726266,comment,4721550,4722408,1,0,irahul,,,"> Maybe is a monad, which means Maybe computations can be chained together with `>>=` (or using `do` notation) without checking for `Nothing`. You can easily produce a large composition of potentially-failing computations while completely ignoring the possibility of failure.<p>Like<p><pre><code>     val = foo.bar.blah.boo rescue nil
</code></pre>
Or<p><pre><code>    try {
        val = foo.bar().blah().boo()
    } catch(NullPointerException ex) {
    }
</code></pre>
Or<p><pre><code>    try:
        val = foo.bar().blah().boo()
    except AttributeError:
        pass
</code></pre>
Yes, I know Maybe is a monad, but that doesn't make a difference to me. A series of computation where a step depends on the results of the previous step and the previous step can return null is hardly an issue in any language.<p>> The case analysis you give as an example is only required at the point when you want to extract the final result into a different monadic context, and even then you would typically use the `maybe` or `fromMaybe` functions to make it more concise.<p>The case analysis I give is an example where either there is a value or null and I need the value. I don't really care how Haskell defines monadic context.",1351745936

That just gives you time to bond to people that the company can ill afford to have on payroll. It takes two weeks to have the top lieutenants justify their existence and for you as CEO to decide whether the effort aligns with the best business model for company survival. Make the hard cuts when you have no ties yet. Apologize, explain it isn't personal and you may even be wrong. Make these the first and last cuts.

It is time to move on.<p>The second thing needed is to assess the talent landscape of those who remain and honestly provide an opportunity for all capable employees to prove themselves. The cream will rise to the top. Those that can reinvigorate the company will volunteer themselves. Now is the time to randomly choose to sit at a lunch table in the company cafeteria and make small talk with employees you don't know.<p>The third thing needed is to create a strategy that has a solid chance of being successfully executed by a select group of these volunteer go-getters. Steve identified Ives as one of these people and came up with the iMac strategy which could best utilize Ives' talent.<p>Sir Richard Branson is another exec who has had to employ this kind of strategy except while already running a company.

Southwest cares about nothing else.<p>They don't do assigned seating because they found that without assigned seats they were able to fill the planes faster, meaning less time at the gate meaning more time in the air, meaning more legs in a day, which makes them more financially efficient.<p>Back in the day they didn't pay travel agents the %15, and sold direct instead, etc.<p>Southwest treats their employees very well, and while there is occasionaly a union squabble of some sort or another, they have much less of a problem than other airlines.  Why?  Becuase its' cheaper to treat your employees well.  Seriously.<p>This also means that customers are happier because employees are happier.<p>The attitude of a southwest steward compared to the big three (Delta, United, Continental) is radically different.  The big three employees often give me attitude and seem to think that dealing with me is some sort of an imposition-- and so I am loathe to fly on them (it only takes a couple incidents.)<p>Awhile back southwest merged with a regional carrier (frontier? no, something else) but that carrier was known for a gimick where the employees would sing on landing or do the safety lecture in rhyme and the pilots would tell jokes.  Southwest didn't change this practice, and it became optional and now it's not unusual to fly on SWA and have a landing limmerick.<p>Their ticker symbol is LUV.<p>Southwest flies into Midland instead of DFW.  They fly into the older city airports, not the big fancy new airports.  Why?  Gate fees are a huge operating cost (basically a license for the local government to extort as much as they can from the airlines for the ""priviledge"" of providing air travel that boosts the cities tax revenues anyway) ... but soutwest doesn't pay to be in the glamorous locations.  You may walk further to your gate and your airport may not be as nice, but it saves them, and -- here's the important thing-- they pass that savings along.<p>Southwest doesn't serve hot meals.  They give you a bag of peanuts labeled ""Frills"".<p>They are one of those unique companies like Apple and Zappos and Crutchfield that really put the customer first, and were willing to go against convention to do it.<p>Nothing against Virgin- I think they're trying to do the same thing and taking the high end of the market, and I'd love to fly Virgin if they had ever had an option on a route I was going (they haven't yet, so I haven't flown Virgin yet.)<p>But Southwest filters everything they do thru their mantra.  They are THE low cost airline.  Does whatever help that?  No?  Then don't do it.<p>Southwest is a result of focus, and <i>that</i> is a useful lesson for every startup.<p>I hear the book written by Herb Kehler (sp?) is well worth reading (I think it's called ""Nuts"" or something like that.)",1351744382

Patterns of time and momentum, with pieces scattered across the board. Non-local multidimensional high-complexity patterns.<p>Of course the best players also see deeper than the rest of us. But in hindsight the moves are rational and the patterns visible, because they're the kinds of patterns we can grok.<p>I wonder if this just a teaser, a taste of things to come. If we can model a situation we can simulate it. Weather, traffic congestion, etc. With a cost function and players, we've got a game engine. Cooperative or competitive.<p>So how does this evolve? Phone apps that organize flash mobs? Google cars that weave helter-skelter without stop lights on bi-directional lanes. Software that calls all the plays, coaches the game, generals the war, controls the money supply or the trading on a futures market.<p>Will we become the spectators, happily playing our side of an invisible gambit?",1351743002

And I thought the grass was greener on the other side too. Having tread the grass on both sides, here's what I've learned: hands-on smarts and school smarts are both indispensable for whatever you do in the future, whether it's starting a business or pursuing other dreams and ambitions. It sounds like you're on a great track for both right now, going to school and hacking on the side. This isn't a zero-sum game, you don't have to give up one for the other :) You may have to do a fair amount of exploring and perhaps change schools or majors to find something that's right for you, but certainly don't drop out and give up on a potentially great college education because you feel what you're learning isn't paying off <i>right now</i>.<p>This topic hits home so this may end up a long post -- you don't have to read it by any means :) Instead go read Steve Jobs' Stanford commencement speech, it's much more eloquent and compelling than anything I have to say, and he tells a great story about how hard he tried to stay <i>in</i> college though he could not afford the tuition.<p>I thought I'd share my experience in hopes it would help give some perspective. First, I would never advise anyone to entirely <i>drop out</i> of school, but I totally gethow you're feeling becauseI took two years away from college to explore and pursue a business idea. I grew up in Silicon Valley (or more accurately, I grew up <i>with</i> Silicon Valley) in an environment where your peers expected you to stay on a straight, almost preordained path to an acclaimed university and then a big tech- or science-related company. And should you stray from that path, it had better be to start a tech company with immediately obviously benefits that everyone understood and praised, or else you'd better prepare to be scorned. Even in SV, the word ""startup"" doesn't always connote glamor, most often people's views of success and fearless entrepreneurship are in hindsight.<p>I was tired of the social pressure and looking for different problems to tackle so I left school temporarily and went as far away from SV as possible -- I went all the way to a mountain village in China to oversee a teeny-tiny clothing factory -- not the type of ""startup"" my SV peers would have been proud of. But I always knew I'd come home to SV and I was determined to finish my degree. I took distance learning classes online so I could earn credits for transferring into a good business program. ""Distance learning"" from a mountainous village in China in meant hooking up a very slow, very unstable dial-up connection (it was a miracle they even had a modem and Internet service at all) at work and doing some random micro-Econ coursework while dozens of sewing machines whirled around me, and praying that the power wouldn't go out suddenly. Sometimes it meant taking final exams at 4am because of the time difference.<p>That experience was both vastly frustrating and great fun, but it would not have been complete if I hadn't gone back to college. I enjoyed being able to hack out my own curriculum, but those online classes would not have mattered if I didn't turn them into a real degree. I got the credits I needed and successfully transferred into the undergrad business program of my choice. After being away for two years, I had become used to being without many resources, and now there were tons of university programs and people who wanted to know all about what I've been doing and help me take those ideas further. The graduate school had entrepreneurship competition and I even got to pitch my ideas on reforming manufacturing processes in the fashion/clothing industry to some VCs. One thing's for sure-- I would've had a hard time coming by those opportunities to drive my ideas even further had I not gone back to finish my degree. I still had to take quite a few pointless classes but those didn't matter compared to everything else the university offered. Sometimes it's hard to tell what's useful and what isn't till further down the road.<p>In the case your college sucks, now's a good time to check out some SV schools since you're already coming out here for your FB internship. You don't have to quit school to explore your ideas. <p>Hope this bit of insight helps and good luck with everything!",1351742593

4726141,comment,4718497,4721536,2,0,gus_massa,,,"> How does it work this way? That is, how could it be the case that those measurements can be related, but you can't use that relation to transmit information?<p>In a simple example, both people measure for example the spin in the x axis of the particles that travel in the z direction. Each has a 50% probability of obtaining ""up"" and a 50% probability of obtaining ""down"". But in every case the get the opposite result, so each one has a random number generator that is synchronized with the other. But each one alone has only a random number generator.<p>Lest suppose that someone try to use that to create an intergalactic first person shooter for two players :). Using the ""synchronized random number generator"" it is possible to make the bots move exactly in the same way in both players computers, but they are only ""synchronized random number generator"" so it's impossible for one player to know what the other player has done (unless they wait until the information arrive in a conventional way, with a speed <=c, but that would be a very big laaaag).<p>But this is only part of the story, because this process can be simulated with a central ""random number generator"" that sends the signals to both players.<p>The strange property is that if both players ""magically"" decide begin to measure the spin in the y direction, they will have the same 50% chances and always get the opposite result. Another possibility that avoids magic is that one of the players continues measure spin in the x direction and the other players begins to measure the spin y direction. Now each one has a ""random number generator"" that is independent of the other ""random number generator"", so each player has no clue about what the other player result. It's not useful for a IFPS, but it's useful as a physic experiment.
(And one of the problems with quantum mechanics is that you can't measure the spin in both directions, you must choose one. It's a little more complicate, but I don't' want to enter into the technical details.)<p>But this is only part of the story, because this process can be simulated with a central ""random number generator"" that generate <i>two</i> random numbers and then sends the signals to both players, one for the x direction and one for the y direction. This is a simplification of the ""hidden variable theory"", that says that the particles ""know"" in advance what to do if they are measured in for the x direction and in the y direction, in spite of that you can't measure both.<p>In the experiments the idea is that the measurements/player decide which direction to use while the particles are flying, so they don't have enough time to communicate (at <= light speed) and agree what the result would be. They have to be in accordance from the start (hidden variable theory) OR they have to communicate faster than light OR something even more strange.<p>Really, to do the measurements it's possible to choose not only the x or y axe, but any direction in that plane. So for every direction each player has a ""random number generator"", but they are not independent. If one measure in the x direction and the other at 45 the probability that the results agree in some number in between 50% and 100%. The 50% is for orthogonal directions that have independent results, the 100% is for the same direction that has ever the same/opposite result, and for the other angles there is a formula to calculate the value. To simulate this you need a lot of hidden variables, or at least a few an a formula to calculate the result for each direction, or any other variation of this idea. There are many possible proposal, some are more simple and some are more complicated, so the idea is to put all of them in the ""hidden variable theory"" bag and forget for a moment the details.
The problem is that Bell proved that for <i>any</i> ""hidden (local) variable theory"" some inequality holds. This inequality ignores the details of the specific theory, so it's not possible to invent a more complex ""hidden (local) variable theory"" that breaks the inequality. When the same calculations are evaluated using the quantum mechanics the result is a value that for some angles is allowed by the Bell inequality but for other angles the value is forbidden by the Bell inequality.  So there is a different prediction of some measurement using the quantum mechanics and <i>any</i> ""hidden (local) variable theory"".<p>And it is possible to do this experiment and calculate a value for every angle. And the result is that for the problematic angles the result agrees with the quantum mechanics predictions and don't holds the inequality that is predicted from <i>any</i> ""hidden (local) variable theory"". So we must eliminate all the ""hidden (local) variable theory"". (For the non problematic angles the result agrees with the quantum mechanics predictions again, and holds the inequality as expected because they are not problematic).<p>More details: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bells_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bells_theorem</a>",1351742487

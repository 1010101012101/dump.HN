Really?<p><i>If your business model relies on technical tricks whose ethics are in a very dark-grey area, you do not get to play the ethics card when I use a technical trick to protect myself from you.</i><p>Yes there are &quot;nice&quot; ads and content creators that need to monetize, and it&#x27;s sad that they get caught in the crossfire.

10297632,comment,10295487,10296166,0,0,steego,,,"You have a point, and I think the source of the author&#x27;s confusion is the article never actually demonstrates the need for union types.  Simply put, his example could have been simplified to this based on his use cases:<p><pre><code>    type ActiveUser = { Name: string; Subscriptions: Subscription list }\n    type DeletedUser = { Name: string; DeletedDate: DateTime }\n\n    let delete (activeUser:ActiveUser) = \n        { Name = activeUser.Name; DeletedDate = DateTime.Now }\n    let undelete (deletedUser:DeletedUser) = \n        { Name = deletedUser.Name; Subscriptions = [] }\n    let addSubscription subscription activeUser = \n        { activeUser with Subscriptions = subscription::activeUser.Subscriptions}\n</code></pre>\nYour approach with subtyping is a valid approach, but you should note that your example doesn&#x27;t actually create immutable objects due to the way you add subscriptions.  I converted your example to F#, so you can appreciate how subtyping in F# has a very natural flow that makes writing types very similar to writing functions.<p><pre><code>    type User internal(name:string, isActive:bool) = \n        member this.Name = name\n        member this.IsActive = isActive\n\n    type ActiveUser private(name:string, subscriptions:Subscription list) = \n        inherit User(name, true)\n        member this.Subscriptions = subscriptions :> IEnumerable<_>\n        member this.AddSubscription(s) = ActiveUser(name, s::subscriptions)\n        new(name) = ActiveUser(name, [])\n\n    type DeletedUser(name, deletedDate:DateTime) = \n        inherit User(name, false)\n        member this.DeletedDate = deletedDate\n        member this.Reactivate() = ActiveUser(name)</code></pre>",1443545915

This is completely unrelated to implicit classes themselves.<p>- Scala had the option to either not ship value types at all, or support only a limited subset of things that can be made work well under the current restrictions. If Scala didn&#x27;t ship value types, the JVM would have probably never gotten them. You can thank Scala developers later for dragging Java people into the 1990ies.<p>- Extension methods looks totally cool on paper, but are pretty much useless for writing maintainable, readable code, which also does something useful:<p><pre><code>    Dev:    &quot;Ok, I want to be able to use String as if it \n             was a collection of chars.&quot;\n    Kotlin: &quot;Sure, just implement all the collection methods\n             one-by-one.&quot;\n    Dev:    &quot;But, but ... all implementations I need are\n             already implemented in that trait over there?&quot;\n    Kotlin: &quot;Bad luck, I guess.

Why isn&#x27;t this considered a straight answer?<p>> <i></i>Snowden didn&#x27;t decide which document&#x27;s to publish - journalists did. He handed over a trove of information, among which was damning evidence that our government was/is doing something they shouldn&#x27;t, and gave journalists the responsibility to publish relevant documents appropriately.<i></i><p>Had he pre-selected which documents to hand over to the journalists, how would this be any different than if he just published them by his own? Snowden knew that he was not supposed to handle this task alone by passing his judgement on these documents by himself, and that he needed someone to help him judge what to disclose and what not to disclose, so he delegated this responsibility to journalists with a reputation he could trust. IMO he was as responsible as one could be: he didn&#x27;t handle this trouble all by himself, he didn&#x27;t let any biases he might&#x27;ve had affect the decisions, and he delegated the task at hand properly to american citizens (this is important, he was dealing with national security after all) he judged to be trustworthy.

He said, in essence, the job of DARPA is to take a serious look at things that sound crazy, but just might work.<p>As background he pointed out that a lot of ideas that are fundamental to our current understanding of science and technology were at one time considered crazy and impractical. Now, most ideas that we today think are crazy or impractical, are in fact crazy or impractical. But it&#x27;s likely that a tiny few will be transformative. DARPA&#x27;s job is to seriously test and cull for the good ideas. Once they find a good idea, they hand it off (as they did the Internet).<p>This can lead to some science-fiction-sounding headlines (like this one). But the truth is that DARPA has no idea if they will work. So when it comes to news coverage of DARPA, you have to bring a big grain of salt.

You do not actually add a stack frame until you consume a token of input and &quot;call&quot; the next item set based on what token of input it was.<p>So, if you have an item X that might call rules Y and Z, instead you have an item set {X, Y, Z}. This has the additional advantage that arbitrary left-recursion is handled naturally, since you&#x27;re discarding the &#x27;call graph&#x27; between rules when you build these sets.<p>To deal with the compressed stack frames that you&#x27;ve now built, you construct a goto table for each item set that tells you what to do based on what item has been returned to you, from the observation that only certain items could have &#x27;called&#x27; certain other rules in the first place.<p>Finally, you add lookahead to your goto tables so that, in case of ambiguity, you can peek ahead to the next token and make your decision that way. This will not solve all ambiguity but it solves most cases in practice.<p>This is a very hand-wavy description, but I hope it is useful if you decide to look further into the Wikipedia article. Unfortunately I have never seen a complete description of an LR(1) parser that takes the conceptual approach, and I don&#x27;t have time to write one here.",1443545333

I certainly don’t want to see all of these info in my JSON when I retrieve a single order on the client side.<p>The moment you move behaviors close to a value object is also the moment a plain object is no longer a plain object. Furthermore, a behavior laden value object becomes hard to evolve, extend and modify.

10297337,comment,10295060,10295060,0,0,tel,,,"> <i>Any connection to transducers?</i><p>Yep!<p>On the fancy Haskell lens hierarchy (hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) we have the notion of a fold or a &quot;getter which touches multiple items&quot;. The existence of a fold for a type like `Fold s a` indicates that we can extract from the type `s` some number (0 to many) `a` values in sequence. This is the idea of &quot;Foldable&quot; in Haskell.<p>Given a foldable type `s` and a transducer we execute the transducer by passing the &quot;build&quot; reducer in and then &quot;visiting&quot; each value `a` inside of `s` with the reducer that the transducer returns (modulo the early stopping bit which is just sort of a Clojure-specific optimization). Essentially, the transducer is a notion of &quot;visitation&quot; which is invariant to how the final summary is constructed—essentially the same thing that&#x27;s captured in the &quot;getter which touches multiple items&quot; of a Fold.<p>So there really ought to be a way to treat any specter optic as a possibly very limited transducer. Essentially, the &quot;read&quot; component of a lens will correspond pretty directly.<p>We can also see this by remembering that any pure transducer is semantically equivalent to a function `a -> [b]` which you can read as a way of finding 0-to-many `b` values &quot;inside&quot; of `a`.",1443543275

The server sits in one or more datacenters, waiting for requests.<p>Let&#x27;s use the house metaphor: say I create a website, www.thisismyhouse.com and you like the content, so you visit my (open) house. My house has certain conventions, social compacts, if you will. You don&#x27;t enter without some sense that there are obligations on both sides: if I am an irritating host, you don&#x27;t stay and eat my food, you leave. If you are an irritating guest, you are escorted out. At no time in the physical world is there a situation where you can use technology to mute the host while still eating the food (aside from <insert dated in-laws joke here> ).<p>&quot;Oho!&quot; someone exclaims, &quot;I spent fuel and time&quot; (internet bandwidth) &quot;to visit your house! This cost me (unit of value) too!&quot; So we agree that both sides have a monetary/value stake in this transaction.<p>But there are rules, folks. The content isn&#x27;t free and never was. Just because you can line up at the buffet and filter out the environment until it meets your requirements through technology doesn&#x27;t mean that you have an ongoing right to keep visiting (consuming).<p>Free content sites are like trialware: you visit, decide if you like it, then pay if you keep using it, and the price is set by the author (ads, subscriptions, you name it). If you don&#x27;t like the price, you don&#x27;t get to keep eating your fill.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of ads, but I accept them as by and large the price of admission to the content I like. There are plenty of ways to get around tracking without fully blocking ads, so that doesn&#x27;t really concern me).<p>If the ads are just too much, I go elsewhere.

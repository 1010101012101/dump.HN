He can be as educated as you like but unless he can increase productivity in some way (access to loans for equipment say, like through Fairtrade) then he still has as much work to do and still needs to provide the labour.<p>Suppose the education increase yields, unless we're on top of the trading practices then the value falls - everyone's yield has increased, if this means the market saturates he might make less money (perhaps none). If the market hasn't saturated he still needs more labour to gather the increased yield but gets the same income to share amongst the labourers - increasing the pressure to provide cheap labour by expanding his family.<p>In short the problem is more complex and IMO is not due to lack of education. What you're saying is that a poor agricultural labourer should sacrifice there own ability to earn more in order to stave off over-population - why is it down to them.<p>I'll go with the converse though. If you ensure that workers get a fair wage (Fairtrade again), one that can pay basic healthcare and education costs and ensure they have healthy food intake and a reasonable dwelling, then there is less pressure to reproduce (but possibly more opportunity to choose to? again it's complex).",1275006211

Most recent papers use techniques that work well on images, apply them to video, show a couple of limited results and of course the authors don't publish any code. Conceptually, everyone can see that this class of techniques is not suitable, and whenever a paper is re-implemented the results are <i>extremely</i> poor. Basically, it looks like a dead end and I think even a tentative first step in a new direction would be counted as a success. But yes I will make sure to clarify this.<p>So based on your advice, over the next few days I will nail down the techniques to try, write a short hypothesis for why I think each one can work, and plan my time so that I am able to run with a promising approach or combination of approaches for the last month or so.<p>Thanks again. If you're interested, drop me an email and if I have something fun I will send you a copy of my writeup later this year.",1275006082

While you're only 20 years old, you can still go through the exercise of thinking about what you want your future to look like in terms of goals, objectives, dreams, etc.<p>Of course, if/when a significant other comes into play, things change. Even more so with children.<p>Whatever you do, don't lock yourself into anything -- you don't want to paint yourself into a corner.<p>Do you have an interest in another startup?  This will impact your liquidity and ability to take risk elsewhere with your finances.<p>If you really don't buy fancy stuff and can live within your means, don't let anyone talk you into anything just because ""you're young"" or any of that bullshit.<p>If you want help from a professional, interview at least 5 candidates, all of whom should come from recommendations from friends, family, board of advisors, etc.<p>Bottom line. . . it's your life, and you only get one shot to make the most of it.  Your need to take risks with your money is only dependent upon what you want to do in the future.  If you have big goals and/or short time-frames, this might call for more risk.  However, if you have modest goals and longer-term time frames, you might need to take little or no risk, but be sure to take taxes and inflation into account.<p>This is a challenging topic to address online because the answer is and should be highly personalized based on your own situation and preferences.<p>Best of luck with it, and congrats on the exit.",1275005982

1385303,comment,1384501,1385177,0,0,mattmanser,,,"I absolutely hate this drive of killing lan games in the name of DRM. 4 of us traditionally met up once or twice a year to play strat games like Starcraft, War 3, CoH, Dawn Of War on a LAN (2 copies usually hacked, £120 for a few nights play? You're having a laugh). Would any of us buy the game otherwise? No. Do <i>ANY</i> of us buy the games now that we can't play this way? No.<p>THQ say strat games are dead, I wonder whether the truth is that they killed them themselves. Dawn Of War 2 with the crapness that is Windows Live was horrid. DoW we played 3-4 years, all of us ended up with legit copies and expansion packs. DoW2 one of us has it, none of us have bought the upgrades, all because we couldn't play it socially.<p>Shot themselves in the foot imho. If they had any sense they'd enable LAN & allow distribution of temporary free keys on the same LAN. Totally one perspective I know, but I've met other people who play games this way, as a social thing, so I can't believe I'm the only gamer lamenting the frankly idiotic battle.net type solution. I care sod all about achievements in what I see as a social game.<p>It's like everyone having to bring their own box of Risk to be able to play it. Dumb.",1275005944

The spare time I have available to me, is actually better spent with my children.<p>I know some people may view that as a cop-out, that I am not really committing to my project, but I grew up with an absent father, and it's actually really important to me that while my kids are young, and looking to me and my wife for really key influence, I want to be there.<p>I figure that once they're young adults and want to go out drinking/partying, I'll have plenty of spare time, and I'll have wisely invested important time with my kids during that first ~15 years or so.<p>So right now, my project plods along - maybe 2 hours per week. I'd love to sink 20 hours a week into them. I tried working late nights, but you end up writing code that needs to be re-written, or coming up with marketing strategies/research that seems like you were smoking illicit substances at the time.<p>So in answer to the original question - a startup most definitely affects your relationship with your wife/girlfriend/family.

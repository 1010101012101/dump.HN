345197,comment,345061,345061,0,0,bigthboy,,,"I think Steve Jobs is right in saying that it will likely remain a hobby for this upcoming year, but in the same sense I believe thats because nobody is really taking a truly proactive, innovative, or scalable approach to it, Apple (and Boxee) included.<p>The industry has before been isolated because of the lack of content.  However, more recently there has been an explosion of content availability.  But further adding to the problem has been the usability of that content.<p>I, personally, own a Media Center PC which I built myself for the purpose of exploring the idea of accessing my TV over the internet.  I must say that I've gone away from that route because everything was bulky and much more complicated than using my Satellite receiver that I already had.  This is a problem that could be overcome if the effort was put forth to actually overcome it.<p>What needs to be done is someone needs to create a single simple box that includes the DVD player, USB ports, infarred, Ethernet port, various A/V input, and S-Video, Composite, and HDMI outputs.  On this device load a very simplistic, efficient software base which can do the following...  Load DVD, Load External Signal, Load ""Full Internet"", Watch ""NET TV""...  I quoted NET TV because it is something that would need to be treated different than the Internet.  NET TV we could think of it as going to certain content website (like Hulu, YouTube, or even iTune's music store, NetFlix, etc.) and browing them through a simplified interface (rather than their traditional interface) and navigating through them to find the shows you want.  This would be done, in a way, like tailoring sites to mobile phone users, only this would be to TV users.  Included could be a new service which is truly ""Live Stream"" from the various news sources.<p>Just a concept btw...",1225121491

By quality I mean you get all the lecture videos , course notes, exams, and hw solutions.  If you compare this to the relevant classes at MIT and Berkeley its just plain better.  At MIT you have no video for their intro CS classes and you don't have access to all the lecture notes and Berkeley is just video. Kudos to Stanford  , this has been a great resource to me.",1225120277
345180,comment,344864,344957,0,0,nradov,,,"I agree. Furthermore, it's important to choose the right type of company. Find one where software development is a core competency and a direct part of the value chain. When senior management sees you as just a cost to be minimized your opportunities for growth and advancement will be limited.<p>I've been interviewing a lot of job applicants lately and have found that most of those who have worked for years in typical corporate IT departments are basically ruined. They only know how to do high-level ""fill in the blanks"" development and don't have what it takes to work for a software product or service vendor. Now to get back on track they would probably have to return to school and start over from scratch. Don't fall into that trap.",1225120260

345178,comment,343693,345080,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yes.<p>In a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious secular environment, personal mores and values should extend quite a ways from the minimum amount that we can all agree on. Traditionally communities have addressed moral issues through the use of volunteer-based civic groups.<p>I like this idea because the majority is not forcing it's definition of morality onto the minority. It also does not involve going to a local or national politician to make a moral case why charity money should be spent one way or another. It does not promote ""one size fits all"" solutions that are supposed to be applicable in wildly varying conditions. In addition, it seems that politicians can get elected simply on the moral persuasion of their arguments instead of their practicality, which is leading us to make promises we can never afford to pay for.<p>I'm for doing something about healthcare, for instance, because I think the buying and selling of health services is not happening in anything like a free market. Most people don't have anything to do with the cost of healthcare (other than paying insurance premiums), and there is virtually no shopping around for services. So the buyer doesn't use his own money, there is no open pricing, and there is no competition on price or quality. In addition, if a company developed a pill that cost a million dollars but let you live to be 150? It's obvious that there are multiple, legitimate players involved that each should have an equal say.<p>So please don't take my response as ""there's nothing wrong."" It's broken, but not everything that is broken needs an immediate, rubber-stamp solution. We work best in complicated environments by setting goals, iterating, re-factoring, trying different solutions -- all things that centralized solutions do not offer.",1225120009

It was fun to play, but very slow, both setting up and moving along during gameplay.<p>I grabbed the Xbox Live version of it a little while ago and, wow.  So much easier and more fun to play.  You just jump right in and start going.  You can usually get through a 2 player game in about 20 minutes.  Scoring is automatic and quick (manually it can typically take 5-10 minutes to score a game once it's over, depending on how many players).  So I'm totally sold on tablet-style board games.<p>Now if only someone ports Battle Chess over to iPad...",1270483190

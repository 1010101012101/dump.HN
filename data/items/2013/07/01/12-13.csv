However, end users don&#x27;t usually care about hardware specs directly, they care about the end experience. And if you&#x27;re pushing for a new platform right now, you have to really try and build an ecosystem around it as soon as possible by earning enough fans and developers to keep the platform sustainable. And as developers, I know we like to think we&#x27;re rather objective about a technology&#x27;s &#x27;true&#x27; merits, but UX impacts our decisions too. So if Ubuntu ships their OS on hardware that will provide a better experience than any FFOS phone out there, Imma place my bets on the OS that shipped with the better overall UX out the gate (even if it&#x27;s not as cheap initially).

Many of them are proud of their extensive automated tests.<p>They&#x27;ll brag about how they have 45,000 or more unit tests, for instance. Yet when we actually look at these tests, many of them just end up implementing a half-baked type system.<p>Even if they don&#x27;t realize it, or don&#x27;t want to acknowledge it, users of dynamic languages do want strong, static typing. It is one of the most useful tools there is when it comes to helping detect or avoid various problems.

Google&#x27;s Picassa for Linux was also using Gekko.<p>True, but only goes to show my point - if firefox&#x27;s extension mechanism made it so super-customizable, surely there would be no need for such browsers?<p>>Firefox&#x27;s UI toolkit is not GTK, but rather XUL+XPCOM<p>Fair enough, but the point stands; when writing extensions you&#x27;re restricted to using the XUL toolkit. Contrast with e.g. activex-based add-ons in Internet Explorer, where AIUI you get the standard windows API and can thus use any toolkit you like.<p>>Imagine a browser who&#x27;s every facet and functionality is customizable by HTML5/Javascript extensions that you can install with one click.<p>I&#x27;m happy to believe that Firefox is the browser that&#x27;s easiest to customize <i>in HTML5/Javascript</i>, I just think that&#x27;s a very arbitrary line to draw. IE addons can be any language you like (because again they&#x27;re just using the standard APIs) and can be installed with one click.<p>There are plenty of good things about firefox, but I don&#x27;t think you can say it&#x27;s more or less customizable than the alternatives without defining customizability in a very arbitrary way. All browsers have a succession of methods of customization, from simple userjs to custom extension formats to embedding the engine in a new executable, with the power and complexity increasing at each step. That firefox&#x27;s &quot;extensions&quot; lie at a bit more powerful and complex point along the line than chrome&#x27;s is not the basis for this blanket claim of greater customizability.",1372683027

You could have the firewall part without the translation part (or with <i>deterministic</i> two-way translation), which would eliminate 99% of problems. let me explain:<p>A NAT &quot;hides the network&quot; behind it because it does two things:<p>1. drops incoming connections (or more precisely, incoming traffic when there was no outgoing traffic from that ip:port on that protocol)<p>2. obscures internal network addresses<p>Dropping incoming connections is what makes it a simple firewall and you could set up a &quot;real&quot; firewall to do the same (there are probably products doing that out of the box). Most firewalls are more complex than that, but they don&#x27;t _have to be_.<p>What makes NATs different is the address translation that obscures the structure of the network behind it. Traditionally this is needed because you have lots of internal addresses and few external addresses (often just one). But if you have more hosts than external IPs then you can&#x27;t have a static mapping without collisions because you have more internal ip:port pairs than external ip:port pairs. Which is why NAT generates internal-external mappings as it goes and why old mappings need to be discarded and why it needs to drop incoming connections (it can&#x27;t know where to forwarded it to if there is no mapping). <i>THIS</i> is the part people hate, because it means you can&#x27;t reliably connect two NATed hosts. If hole punching worked reliably it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, it feels like a hack, but the internet is a patchwork of much worse hacks.",1372683002

Oh, and of course, with a Firefox OS phone, you can just write and deploy your own apps without having to ask anybody&#x27;s permission.

Then I remember youtube coming online and the first new greats of the re-energised internet. I remember &quot;Netscape&quot; and the prominence of Yahoo and other search engines. There were quite a few knocking around. Napster was a cool sounding name and &quot;What do you mean you can just download the song?&quot; was quite a common question. Early attempts at building sites had you looking as much at yahoo and msn rankings as Google :) Then there were a plethora of search engines trying to secure niches, and they couldn&#x27;t be ignored, then Google started buying everything and we were hearing about how awesome it was to work at their place and about the history of starting in a garage and how the underdogs with the cool motto had risen to power. Then adsense became big and people realised you could make money by letting them advertise on your site, and people thought &#x27;wow&#x27;, but by that time everything had already become much much more cut-throat. People were starting to question whether they would link to your site without &#x27;a reciprocal&#x27; - suddenly words like &#x27;reciprocal&#x27; meant something to the owner of a camp-site in southern England. Things started to get very competative, and &#x27;rankings&#x27; were really a hot topic. Around this time, article marketing spawned millions of spam article directories and content-creation bots. There were tons of spam link directories where bots could post links. All anchor text was keyphrased up to the teeth, and everyone was into SEO. SEO for Google - nobody &quot;optimised&quot; for the other sites. The controversy was largely around which browser would win, not which search engine - everyone knew that would be Google. By mid 2000&#x27;s it was basically just Google, people had stopped really caring about the others. The only blips on the radar now seem to be Yandex in Russia and of course Baidu. Apart from them and the possibility of a small portion of traffic being taken if yahoo and bing ever merge, the internet is basically governed by Google now, and it&#x27;s increasingly clear that they wield more power than many governments - a supra-national self-regulating power that can make or break any business at will. that&#x27;s a scary amount of power to have given anyone.",1372682493

If what you&#x27;re suggesting were actually true, then there&#x27;d be no need for a preferences dialog at all, and all users would configure Firefox using about:config. But we both know that isn&#x27;t true. It is not convenient to remember the name of a specific about:config option, especially when the names change periodically. Even filtering by part of the option name isn&#x27;t convenient, as that requires remembering Mozilla&#x27;s terminology, and using a general term like &quot;javascript&quot; still leaves many options to sift through manually.<p>As for the status bar, the URL popup shown when hovering over links is much less usable than the status bar. It is harder to quickly focus on, for instance. Having to remember yet another obscure keyboard shortcut for functionality that should be enable by default, like the addon bar, does not promote usability, as well.<p>The menu bar is not a &quot;waste of space&quot; because it more than pays back its cost by making a huge amount of commonly-used functionality very easily accessible. It is especially valuable because of the cross-application conventions it embodies, making it take even less effort to perform common tasks.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t have to manually enable core functionality like menus or the status bar, for example. Such functionality should already be enabled by default when Firefox is first installed. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t like the menu bar or the status bar should have the option to disable them, of course.

Our system would only lose data if nodes 1, 2 and 3, nodes 4, 5 and 6 or nodes 7, 8 and 9 fail simultaneously.<p>> In contrast, with random replication and a sufcient number of chunks, any combination of 3 nodes would be a copyset, and any combination of 3 nodes that fail simultaneously would cause data loss.<p>In the case above, in case of single node failure there only 2 other nodes from which new replacement node can bootstrap. They then relax the constraint that one node belongs to only one Copyset, which slightly increases the probability of data loss, but speeds up recovery from partial failure.",1372681766

He&#x27;s probably the most &quot;famous&quot; of the proponents of the whole plate arrangement theory.<p>The general idea that plate tectonics causes the overall cycle of ice ages doesn&#x27;t seem very controversial.  What the geologist types seem to fight over a lot is Exactly which of numerous causes contributes Exactly what percentage of the positive feedback loop in Exactly which numerical model.<p>For example Kuhle has a lot of publications about the tibetan plateau being a great place to bootstrap the glacial positive feedback loop.  There&#x27;s others who get all excited about the precise location of the continents affecting the flow of ocean currents pushing warmth up north... The current that pushes warm water to England so its warmer than alaska, the current that used to flow over Panama but can&#x27;t anymore, the current that used to not exist over the Bearing straits in Alaska but exists now.  Then theres the other folks who get all wound up about continents being over a pole (like antarctica) or landlocking a polar ocean (like the other side, the north pole) leading to glaciers.  There&#x27;s something of a minority opinion about &quot;really big continents with mountains in the middle covered in glaciers&quot;... think America&#x27;s Glacier National Park as visual model, other than its all melting right now.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about the book you linked to, although it&#x27;s reviews make it look interesting.",1372681260

This is an interesting idea, but it&#x27;s incredibly radical - I&#x27;m not sure even Kay realises how radical it is. As other people have said, a lot of people want to use a computer simply as a tool, to get on and do their work; that&#x27;s because they have some definite &quot;work&quot; to do, and that work doesn&#x27;t include exploring their computing system. Moving to Kay&#x27;s vision would require abolishing this division of labour, right up to the fundamental division of labour between conception and execution, between means and ends. That is, to realise Kay&#x27;s ideas of computer use we would have to establish a system with no distinction between work and creative activity: we would have to establish full communism.",1372680132

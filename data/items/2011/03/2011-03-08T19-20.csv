2302363,comment,2301812,2302244,0,0,jashkenas,,,"Absolutely, but the idea here is a bit different. JavaScript is a language that we're stuck with for the entire foreseeable future of the web, for better or for worse ... and CoffeeScript is a conscious attempt to try and work within that limitation. Unless you're willing to take the significant performance hit of running an interpreter on top of JavaScript, you have to stick fairly close to JavaScript semantics.<p>That said, we certainly try to improve upon JS semantics, where it's possible to do so without a performance hit. Things like auto-lexical scoping, bound functions, chained comparisons and, most importantly, ""everything is an expression"", are all examples of this.",1299614378

It should be the case, that if I call <i>through Google Voice</i>, I get presented as <i>calling from my GV number</i>.  That would make it easy for my friends, as they could just hit my call on their Recent Calls list like they do for everyone else.<p>Google Voice doesn't present caller ID consistently.  Sometimes, it comes across as ""Unknown.""  To reach some of my friends who won't answer an ""Unknown"" call, this means I am forced to call directly from another number of mine, which creates a habitually attractive call-back option (Recent calls) what won't have my Google Voice number.<p>In short: Google Voice still has a long way to go!",1299614310

2302328,comment,2302202,2302202,0,0,pedoh,,,"Congratulations on your new startup! My third daughter is now two and a half weeks old.<p>I think that the biggest step for you will be to come to terms with the fact that nothing will ever be the same. And I say that, knowing that you won't fully grasp that until the first time you see your child. And then you'll relearn that with any subsequent children! For me, the first time I've held each of my children, I've been completely floored and awed and instantly in love. All of a sudden, here is a person on earth that I would die for. It's amazing.<p>You and your wife are about to be very tired. Your son will need to be fed, changed, and burped ... and sometimes it will seem like there's no break in between! I think establishing very regular patterns is a good thing for everyone. Same time to bed, same time to get up, et cetera. It will take tweaking and modification as time goes on, but talk to your wife on a regular basis about how the patterns are working or not working, adjust, and keep on going. For us right now, the pattern is that she goes to bed earlier and I stay up with the baby, letting her get some solid sleep until the baby needs to be fed again. We're still tweaking the parameters, and we've been so fortunate to have my wife's mother staying with us, and she's a huge help, so once she's left, it will be another adjustment.<p>I suggest using a cosleeper. Having the baby sleep with you in the bed may very well mean that you don't sleep as well because you'll be paranoid that you'll roll over onto the baby. Or worse, you'll roll over onto the baby! A cosleeper puts the baby conveniently close.<p>Crying is okay. Let him cry a little bit. The natural instinct is to immediately feed / change / console. If you are solving his problems a microsecond after he announces there's a problem, then he'll expect that every time. If he's allowed to cry a little here and there, he'll understand that mom and dad will still take care of him. It will ease the transition to the day when he's sleeping in a crib, not in the same room (also highly recommended).<p>Take ALL advice with a grain of salt. What works for me won't necessarily work for you. Be ready to try different approaches. Note that this may be in direct conflict with establishing regular patterns!<p>Best wishes to you and your wife, and if you have any questions you want to run by a new dad (before or after your son is born), please feel free to reach out, my email is in my profile.",1299613773

But whether its better for entrepreneurs or not is a different question really, but I'll try to answer it...<p>Dublin's startup scene is at a much earlier stage, so there certainly isn't the same sort of community, talent, mentorship etc.<p>Raising money would also be more challenging, since there are only a hand full of VC's.<p>Sounds a little trivial, but it is worth saying that there is a really strong sense of pessimism here at the moment (because we're basically bankrupt). This is actually rather overwhelming and hard to escape from.<p>I also agree with the point regarding ambition. There isn't the same rampant enthusiasm here to actually build things and achieve something. So its harder to find like-minded co-founders... people who are willing to throw caution to the wind, work incredibly hard and just go for it.<p>Having said all those things, its undeniable that there is definitely something really positive happening in Dublin at the moment.

During the last 10 years here, the game plan was this... get a good job, leverage yourself up to the tonsils to buy a house and watch as it increased in value by 20% year on year. They buy another. People were becoming paper millionaires in their 20's, so there was no incentive to try something else. Things are different now and I think that the startup bug is going to catch pretty soon.

Then you could revert to pre-merge state with ""git pull --undo"", just like you can abort a rebase with ""git rebase --abort.""<p>Optimize for the common case.  Of probably hundreds of merge-before-commit operations I have performed with other VCS's, I can't think of a single time I have wanted to undo this operation (after all, if upstream has changed you're going to have to merge sooner or later -- it might as well be now).

""git reset"" is a data-losing operation if you call it with certain parameters.  For example, ""git reset --hard HEAD^"" would throw away the WIP!  I'm wary of making such a command something I type all the time, because there's always the risk that I'll call it wrong.<p>2. I have to do this dance of ""commit, checkout, pull, checkout, rebase"" just to pull upstream changes.  And when I want to actually push the change upstream, I have to ""merge --squash"" and then delete the old branch (otherwise lots of branches will build up and I won't know which ones have been committed and which haven't).  It's a lot of annoying overhead.  I'd rather just work on master where I can just ""pull"", and branch only if I really want to work on two big changes in parallel.<p>> HTH.<p>I really do appreciate that you were genuinely trying to be helpful (as opposed to other replies).

2302262,comment,2301087,2301087,0,0,grellas,,,"The legal argument in this case is twofold: (1) that Congress lacks the constitutional power to enact a copyright statute that does not in fact work to promote the progress of the arts, etc.; and (2) that the particular enactment here - taking works that were already in the public domain and conferring upon them <i>ex post facto</i> copyright protection - violates the free speech rights of individuals (including libraries and other repositories of public-domain works) by subjecting them to risks and liabilities that effectively harm their right to make free expression of works that belong to the public generally and not to a particular copyright holder.<p>The tricky precedent is the <i>Eldred</i> case by which the Court had upheld Congress' power to extend copyright terms beyond those originally permitted when a particular work qualified for copyright protection. That case had been argued primarily on a theory that the ""progress clause"" of the constitution (that Congress shall have authority to enact copyright laws to promote the progress of the arts, etc. for limited times) prohibited repeated extensions that effectively made the copyright terms permanent and hence not for ""limited times"" only. The Court had rejected that argument in a 7-2 decision.<p>Here, EFF distinguishes <i>Eldred</i> by arguing that, while Congress may have the power to extend rights of existing copyright holders, it lacks the power to restore to a copyright holder rights to works of authorship that no longer belong to them but are instead in the public domain. That is, such ""restorations"" do nothing to further the progress of the arts (the constitutional justification by which Congress can enact such laws) and, even if they do, are nonetheless constitutionally defective because they violate free speech rights of those who seek to express themselves in a vibrant public commons consisting of public domain works available to all.<p>The legal nuances here are tricky but it is highly encouraging that the Court decided to grant certiorari in this case. Liberals have long argued for virtually unlimited powers for Congress in enacting statutory laws while conservatives have basically rubber-stamped such broad powers when it comes to expanding IP laws and the Court's factions have tended to follow these broader trends. In a digital age, this means basically that those who can ""persuade"" Congress to enact pet legislation favoring their commercial interests have an open ticket to extend their protections far beyond what was properly intended by copyright laws, among others. Perhaps this case will begin to draw a line or two that says, ""enough is enough."" It will be interesting to see it play out. Kudos to EFF for being at the forefront of this fight.",1299613007

That means that deciding any property about a given piece of code amounts to search over a finite space.<p>This is very different from true Turing completeness where a small set of rules might require unbounded space and computation to decide, and in general will not even be decidable.  Now, the author of this code says in a parent post that we can't build a real Turing machine.  That's true, but doesn't mean that we can't specify a real Turing complete process; it just means that for some executions we have to give up on running them.<p>In some cases, it makes sense to consider languages that are not actually Turing complete as approximately Turing complete.  For example, if you take the C programming language, with a 64 bit memory space, then again there's technically only a finite space of possible program states.  But in that case, you can have a 100 line C program that can generate 2^64 possible program states.  Turing completeness is a reasonable approximation.  If you had to allocate every bit of memory explicitly with a unique line of C code, it would no longer be very reasonable to consider C approximately Turing complete.",1299611363

If they weren't, I would expect to see far fewer empty storefronts than I do now -- and I've recently seen this not just in my local small town, but also in Sacramento, in the Bay Area, and even in Seattle.<p>Locally, I know for a fact that there are a number of property owners that would prefer to have their space sit empty rather than rent it out for the amounts that people are willing to pay right now. I've talked to them.<p>Housing is not that much different, except that at the moment there is higher-than-usual demand for rental properties, so the ""market forces"" are driving the prices upward. Still, unless you are a property owner who foolishly can't afford to let a building sit vacant, you can get away with charging higher rent than other people are for similar properties.<p>I agree with the person here saying that these effects are due to information asymmetry. As a prospective renter -- either for commercial or for housing space -- in order to find the best possible deal, I must invest a lot of time contacting numerous people, reviewing various Google Maps mashups, reviewing classifieds, and wandering around town. As a landlord, to set a price I simply have to take a quick glance at what nearby properties are going for, add a little bit to that amount, and then wait.<p>Eventually, a prospective renter will come along, because they don't know where the better deal is.",1299611340

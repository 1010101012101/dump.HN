7267629,comment,7266546,7267433,14,0,electrograv,,,"&quot;Deep Learning&quot; is not itself a candidate for anything, because it&#x27;s not any single algorithm, but a category of approaches.<p>Deep Learning generally refers to machine learning algorithms that deal with stacking multiple layers of simpler functions to enable more complicated functions, and optimizing all the parameters to best fit your training set and generalize to new samples (the hard part). Though it usually refers to neural networks, I dont think there&#x27;s any reason it doesn&#x27;t also apply to other layered approaches as long as there&#x27;s a relatively unified learning algorithm applied across the whole system.<p>There are clearly many different deep learning algorithms, even if you just count the permutations of tricks you can choose from to improve layered NN generalization. Though to be fair I think very good progress is being made towards developing &quot;better&quot; algorithms in the sense that new ones (e.g. RBM pretraining + dropout) usual perform better than than older algorithms, no matter what data you use it on (now network architecture is another matter entirely).",1392854367

7267621,comment,7263139,7267458,2,0,phaus,,,">Arguable, but then what makes keys and passwords &quot;not a part of the implementation&quot;?<p>They are part of the implementation of a network, but the issues involving passwords and cryptographic keys are so complex that they generally aren&#x27;t lumped into a conversation about security through obscurity. I made the statement in response to your claim that someone obtaining your SSH key would render SSH an example of security through obscurity, if my definition and the author&#x27;s definition were used. With that line of thinking, the entire cryptography industry is merely security through obscurity and we should just give up. In practice, cryptographic technologies aren&#x27;t considered to be security through obscurity unless the technologies are provably broken to a point where only an idiot would rely on them (such as WEP or LANMAN). As a caveat to this, when a cryptographic algorithm is hidden from the public in order to remain unbroken, it does become an example of security through obscurity. I just object to the idea that this is the only meaning to the phrase.<p>> I object to SSID as example of &quot;security through obscurity&quot; because I think it doesn&#x27;t get at the core of what&#x27;s wrong with security through obscurity and it has other far more glaring issues - so someone can fully grok that keeping SSID secret is not worthwhile and see &quot;why&quot; but without that &quot;why&quot; generalizing to (say) the company saying &quot;We use our own proprietary cryptosystem. We can&#x27;t show anyone the algorithm; it&#x27;s more secure that way!&quot;<p>The issue we began with was that you stated that it was not an example of security through obscurity at all. That was an incorrect statement and it still is. If you now want to argue that its not the best example, I would agree with you.<p>As an introductory example it does a good job of explaining the concept to a layperson or even a technical person that&#x27;s still a bit inexperienced. Could you find a better example to give to a room full of newbies? Probably, but that wasn&#x27;t the issue we disagreed on.<p>Its also important to note, that in a room full of security experts, you would be able to delve into the more complex aspects of the issue without losing the audience, so of course the example would be different.",1392854316

That&#x27;s equivalent to a form of MIMO, in which the antennas are widely distributed in space.  Consequently, I&#x27;d expect it to be subject to the same limitations as MIMO.<p>I&#x27;m predicting that the breathless claims of &quot;no limit&quot; are based on being the only show in town.  As long as the system is controlling every transmission in a volume of space it will do well, and you will be able to add users until you reach the same limits that a MIMO system would hit if it was the only transmitter.  Start adding uncontrolled interference, and things will start to degrade.<p>Maybe the next step, would be for the distributed base stations to use receivers to sample the spectrum.  This data could be fed back into the cloud and an attempt be made to predict and cancel the uncontrolled interferers.  The FCC (or local equivalent) might take a dim view of this though, if it turned out that the cancellation was effectively jamming other users.<p>--- Edit.<p>Just adding, in my experience, if you want to understand the latest radio communications technology, speak to a radio astronomer.  When MIMO first came out and people were trying to figure out its limits, it turned out that the radio astronomers already knew the limits, based on their knowledge of large antenna arrays.

7267398,comment,7263350,7267348,2,0,lutusp,,,"> Hm, that&#x27;s contrary to what I&#x27;d heard<p>I think some of the confusion arises because of vacuum thermos bottles, which are really efficient at holding onto their heat. But how they work is a bit complicated. They deal with conduction and convection losses by having the vacuum barrier between the contents and the outside. As to radiation, they rely on a reflector that&#x27;s part of the vacuum bottle, which has the effect of greatly slowing the rate of heat loss by radiation.<p>So the vacuum thermos avoids radiation heat loss, not because of the vacuum, but with a reflector. That works in space too -- many orbiting telescopes use reflectors to keep the sun&#x27;s heat energy from heating up the sensors and spoiling their performance.<p>But a vacuum is a pretty good medium for heat loss by radiation. The moon&#x27;s surface, heated to several hundred degrees Celsius during the lunar daytime, drops to <i>26 Kelvins</i> after a few (earth) days of darkness (26 degrees above absolute zero). That&#x27;s a new figure, lower than had been realized, and <i>seven degrees colder than the surface of Pluto</i>.",1392852339

Security through obscurity can be something as simple as manually assigning a non-standard port to a service (such as HTTP). The example of disabling the broadcast of an SSID is also a valid example of security through obscurity.<p>You seem to have an issue with me using the SSID as an example because its so easy to defeat that it would be a waste of time to even try. Like I said before, that&#x27;s the entire point. Its obvious to us now, in 2014, but for years people were told by &#x27;experts&#x27; to disable it as a security measure. Some individuals actually used to attempt to secure their networks by hiding the SSID instead of using a password. The prevalence of this kind of negligence is one of the key reasons that disabling the broadcast became the prototypical example used to explain why security through obscurity doesn&#x27;t work.<p>In short, its not an example I made up on my own formed from a lack of understanding security, its an example that&#x27;s used in textbooks and security-specific certification study guides. Its an example that&#x27;s taught in introductory IT and IT security classes. I&#x27;ll try to find some more specific citations to put your mind at ease, its been quite a while since I&#x27;ve taken an introductory course on the subject.<p><a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Avoid_security_by_obscurity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Avoid_security_by_obscurity</a><p>>not everything that is bad is &quot;security through obscurity&quot;.<p>And I agree with this, but my example most certainly is a valid case of security through obscurity.<p>Update: Better Sources<p>From Hacking Exposed: Wireless, 2nd Edition Pg. 80<p>From the first paragraph on security through obscurity:<p>>Many wireless networks today operate in hidden or nonbroadcasting mode. These networks don’t include their SSID (network name) in beacon packets, and they don’t respond to broadcast probe requests. People who configure their networks like this think of their SSID as a sort of secret.

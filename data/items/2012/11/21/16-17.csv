4815051,comment,4814322,4814817,8,0,PieSquared,,,"To expand on your suggestion a little, I would suggest going even further - learn how to design your own processors and figure out how the low-level details <i>really</i> work. With hardware description languages such as Verilog, programmers can apply a lot of their knowledge to hardware engineering. I've found that a lot of things carry over from conventional programming languages to HDLs, and that it's incredibly easy to get started. The computer engineering mindset is pretty similar to low-level programming, and really helps you understand how your code runs, even more so than assembly.",1353517191

For the most part, recruiters haven't the first clue what developers do or how they can demand the salaries and contracting rates the market offers. For the most part recruiters view developers & designers as arrogant and self-righteous. Only recruiters who genuinely understand the divide between recruiters & developers and understand what developers face on a day to day basis tend to show or possess any respect.<p>We call the latter 'the good ones' and they are incredibly rare but they do exist.",1353517168

It's great that your users are requesting features that are already on your roadmap! That means you're potentially on the right track or at least know a bit more about your users.<p>When you complete them, you can tell your users that, ""we listened to YOU the community and have delivered what you have asked for"". You'll be able to keep those early users through the early stage roller coaster much more easily.<p>Your job isn't to be smarter or always one step ahead of your customers--it's to provide value to them so they can't live without you.

4815044,comment,4814481,4814943,2,0,cliftonmckinney,,,"There are definitely good ones out there. And those that take the time to learn to write a little code have a much better chance of being on that list. We know a few good ones too. Few and far between, but clearly possible.<p>One thing I didn't mention in the post is that, in a lot of cases, the incentive system for recruiters isn't necessarily aligned with the best interests of the companies and developers they work with. Recruiters are a bit like sell side realtors. The incentive for them is to push a lot of product. So, as a sell side realtor, my financial incentive pushes me to accept the first offer that comes through, whether it's a low ball or not, and move along. Only rarely do I dismiss that financial incentive for the benefit of my client, because 6% of $300k isn't much different than 6% of $320k.<p>So, it's actually <i>irrational</i> for recruiters to spend a lot of time finding the perfect employee for their client, or the perfect job for their recruit, if it takes more time than normal.<p>Unless, of course, you take a longer term view. Longer term, highly successful placements mean that you get more clients and more high quality recruits. But, again, it's hard to think long term when we change careers so often.<p>Glad to know you're one of the good ones.",1353517158

I live in Northern California and have family in Southern California. We're starting to flip the holidays this year (wife's family for thanksgiving, mine for Xmas). Just went down to LA for a friends wedding and the drive was horrendous.<p>A lot of factors come into play:<p>1, as much as I've hated them in the past, a big suv (especially with a kid) is the way to go. We have a VW Passat (wife's) and it was so crammed it was ridiculous. Very uncomfortable and it's not even a compact.\n2, I'm over 40 now and it just physically hurts to drive for 7 hours. I was totally sore the next day. Frickin sucked.\n3, Directions. I totally need navigation now. Even with the turn by turn on my phone, I still made wrong turns.\n4, I hate driving. Hate it. I see it as such a waste of time. I can't imagine needing to drive to make a living. In my late teens and early 20's when I lived in Southern California, I hade to do just that. After I moved to the city I vowed I never would again.\n5, Other drivers. I was pretty appalled by some of the drivers on the road. I kept thinking, I can't wait for computers to handle this so that guy driving down the emergency lane wouldn't be able to.<p>If I could just hop in a driverless car for that drive, it would be great. I could nap, read, compute, converse, etc. Things I can't do now. I'm sure there's going to be some resistance at first by those with a 'god given right' to drive. But after a while, I see common sense prevailing.<p>I listened to a great talk at The Long Now Foundation by Tim O'Reilly. He was talking about driverless cars and how the DARPA car challenge when it started could only do around 7 miles. It wasn't the algorithms that got that much better (although I'm sure they did) for the Google cars, it was the data set. Google Maps was a huge advantage and the 'killer app' for the latest generation of their cars.<p>So a lot to look forward to in this arena.

In my spare time I've been teaching myself Javascript and (with the help of my flatmate, who is a software developer) C#. I do this because I enjoy it, and consider it a valuable skill to have as technology becomes more and more integral to my life. But I also do it because it makes me better at my job. If I can understand a company's requirements better than 90% of other recruiters ringing them up, then that benefits them, the candidate whose CV I'm representing, and me.<p>Now, I know that a lot of developers have had bad experiences with recruiters. I've had bad experiences with recruiters, when I was looking for a job out of university. You see, in the UK at least, a lot of recruitment consultants are graduates like me who couldn't find a relevant job in their field of interest, or one that bore any relationship to their degree. So instead we got caught up in the recruitment industry, which offers a salary, office experience, and the potential to (allegedly)earn some money. The majority of us are as confused as you are as to why we're here, but those of us who are still doing it after 3 months are probably doing it because there's something in it they enjoy, or they've been lucky enough to keep it.<p>I get that there's bastards in the industry. There's bastards in every industry. And the tech industry isn't the only one beset by recruiters. I used to work in social housing recruitment, where we were actually liked by those people we were trying to find jobs for. To go from that, to an industry where we are seen as 'the scum of the earth' (which I saw on this site), 'evil bottom feeders' and 'fucking idiots' came as a shock to me.<p>I'm not asking you to all suddenly start getting lovey dovey with us. This won't change many peoples mind. But be aware that on the other end of the phone is probably a young graduate, terrified out of his mind, who has been thrust into an industry he doesn't know anything about, and expected to hit some ridiculous targets in order to keep his job. A lot of the time, his only mistake has been accepting a job when he didn't have one. Recruitment preys on the desperate, lost demographic of graduates.<p>So yes, every industry has its shits. But for the most part a lot of recruiters have nothing but respect for developers and designers in the tech industry. Hell, we're scared of you most of the time. You guys possess talent that we can only dream of having, and pretty much make the world go round. All we're doing is helping you find a job.<p>tl;dr Recruiters are people too.

(I shoot most if my work in digital though, so I don't consider myself all that snobby about it)<p>To me some arguments for film hold up, but are rapidly becoming less relevant as digital sensors improve.  The biggest case form film to me is the dynamic range (in film terms ""latitude"") compared to digital.  Film is currently still better at retaining detail in high contrast shots (for example a person dimly lit against a bright sky).  And when film does ""blow out"" it has a tendency to be a smooth curve and even the over-exposed parts of the frame that may be fully white still have some texture.  Whereas digital has a harsh drop off where the information is just gone and it has a rather ugly look.<p>Newer camera sensors are starting to get very, very close to film in terms of latitude.  But for the moment even the most expensive Hollywood level cameras are not quite as good.  I expect this to change and eventually film won't have this advantage anymore.<p>Film does tend to have a pleasing, organic look.  But plugins are getting very good at emulating the good parts of that without all of the hassles of film.  I liken it to audio recording, which went through a similar analog-vs-digital revolution in the 90's.  there are still people that choose analog for artistic reasons, but digital is accepted as the primary recording medium now.<p>As for 48fps, though, that's irrelevant in the digital-vs-film argument because both types of cameras can shoot at either frame rate.",1353515500

We are a tiny team, and so far, we've had zero luck in our attempts to grow by hiring developers.  Problems which are small now will only get bigger.<p>There are a lot of things I'm willing to take risks with, but not with <i>your</i> ability to provide support to customers for <i>your</i> business.<p>And so it is with a very heavy heart that we will cease operating Charm from Dec 15, for the foreseeable future.<p>You won't be billed again, and we'll refund your last payments.<p>We will gladly help you migrate your data out of Charm. Please contact us directly (support@charmhq.com) for help.<p>Thank you so much for taking a chance on us, and sharing our dream for a superior email interface.<p>I'm truly sorry to disappoint you.<p>Best wishes,<p>Amy",1353515279

Somehow you'd think that that part of the gas that is exposed to friction is limited to the portion that was slowed down by the interaction with the wall, and that the rest of the gas would not be subject to this because it is moving at roughly the same speed as the carriages.<p>During the acceleration phase this would definitely be an issue, the gas in front of the carriage would be compressed because the carriage is moving much faster than that body of gas. But that (hot) gas could be dumped just prior to insertion of the carriage into the tube.<p>Maybe the outside of the 'sheath' could be made from a heatsink like profile? I haven't given the thermodynamics of the thing much thought, I was basically just trying to figure out a solution that would not require some far-out technology.<p>I know that lots of people like to link space with Elon Musk but I think he's much more practical than that, space is a means for him to get to mars and Nasa a convenient way to finance it.<p>Other than that Tesla doesn't have anything to do with space and is ground transportation, I don't see any reason to go into low earth orbit with all the associated risks if you could do the whole thing on the ground and be:<p><pre><code>  - safer\n\n  - as fast\n\n  - not have the energy expenditure of having to work \n    against gravity\n\n  - easier to maintain\n\n  - shorter path \n</code></pre>\nThe thermodynamics of having 'slugs' running around a tube are beyond what I can easily compute back of the envelope style, the only thing I see is that the amount of power put in to the system would have to be radiated out somehow or you'll end with a net gain in energy.<p>That's mostly a surface area increase problem, the air over a highway is notably warmer than the air around it simply because all those cars dump the combined energy of burning all their fuel into the environment. If you can reduce the energy input into the system then you'll reduce the amount of energy you have to get rid of afterwards. So I can see that reducing that input energy is really important and that changing the speed of the cars is brutal in this respect because it causes the air behind it to pile up against it (heating it up) when decelerating (but the air in front would cool down due to expansion) and vice versa.<p>It's an interesting problem and if I wouldn't have a ton of other stuff to do I'd happily cook up a simulator for this.",1353515079

I certainly don't subscribe to the same overall viewpoint. More likely for him is he's been burned out more times than he realizes and he's soldiered on, harming his health and his company in the process. The fact that he's managed to succeed anyway is irrelevant to the burnout argument. That's not personal observation, that's science. His psychological contortion in convincing himself that doesn't apply to him is fine to keep him happy, but he shouldn't kid himself: if he'd taken the occasional break, he would probably have been able to think better more of the time.<p>The main messagepassion mattersis important, and I agree with that for sure. That's for keeping your energy up regularly. The secondary messageif you're passionate, you can work without stoppingis incredibly dangerous. More likely if you're passionate you can lose sight of whether or not you've burned out; I know I've kept working in a burned out state before.<p>Even if it's true that Aaron Levie has avoided burnout because he's just so damn passionate about what he does that he's become immune to general biological observations (perhaps he has a rare mutation that exempts him from these problems), science pretty much tells us that chances are, <i>you won't have this advantage</i>.<p>So be wary of following his argument to its logical conclusion. Work on something you're passionate about, yes. It will make your days more fun, it will make your interactions with your fellow workers more fun, and it will make life more fun.

The value of the distances is (potentially) computed by some encapsulated algorithm -- you're not acting <i>on</i> that resource.  The server resources that are touched are the two cities, and then whatever it does behind the scenes.<p>>This is a really weird thing to say. No, you don't. I have no idea why you would think that.<p>Because I'm not GETing a city, so I can't use the GET operation on the city resource; I have to make another resource to GET.  Fine, it doesn't have to be a city pair: but there is a many-to-many mapping, which in REST-favoring frameworks (e.g. Rails), requires a separate table.  By reducing everything to CRUD, you must create a new resource (type) for each new operation.<p>>(And POST/GET/PUT/DELETE is a very different concept from CRUD.)<p>That's a non-standard definition of ""very different"", considering that POST is create, GET is retrieve, PUT is update, and DELETE is delete.",1353513601

However, if the algorithm is combining fundamental financial data, analyst's outlooks/forward looking statements, current trends/movements in the market, AND Twitter/media data then I think this could be quite successful.  A huge reason why our capital markets are not perfect is because of emotion in the market (case in point Ford's strong run for the last year fueled by optimism and relatively strong performance and the pullback since qtr 4 earnings were released, and a thousand or more other examples). Effective investment algorithms must attempt to be comprehensive in taking into account factors that effect share prices and the public's sentiment is certainly one of those factors.<p>The positive trading sessions for companies with quality Super Bowl advertisements following the big game is a perfect example of this point.

The point is whether the DOM is at the appropriate level of abstraction for writing business app UI logic. I wrote at the level of the DOM for years, and when I switched to ExtJS it felt like a liberation. I spend way more time on business logic and experimenting with different UI designs, and far less time fighting with browsers.<p>> JavaScript is a prototypical language, you can't use it to the ""fullest"" if you force OOP on it.<p>OOP and prototypal inheritance don't conflict.

By mixing these three colors you can create any color the human vision system can perceive (yes, because of tristimulus).<p>When white light hits a material, some of those RGB wavelengths are absorbed (subtracted). RGB - GB(Cyan) = Red, RGB - RG(Yellow) = Blue, RGB - RB(Magenta) = Green. Thus, Cyan, Magenta and Yellow act as primaries (colors from which you can construct any visible color) for materials that absorb, not emit light.<p>The forth primary in print media, Black, is simply added because inks are imperfect and a mix of CMY inks yields a kind of murky black (plus it wastes ink).<p>It's a historical simplification to say that ""red, yellow and blue"" are the primaries for paint, the red works like a magenta, the blue works like a cyan. They sell Cyan/Yellow/Magenta primaries for oil/acrylics and if you paint with these you'll get a brighter, wider palette but you can get there with a traditional palette by adding whites and other pigments.<p>The tone of the article is awful. The opening sentence, ""Ask any artist..."" is flatly untrue, this stuff is basic for most visual artists (I first learned about the CMY primaries in a community ed. Painting I class). It's not that the article is factually wrong, it's just basic stuff presented as if it were obscure or clever.<p>None of this makes the color wheel or any other color theory any less valid.

Sadly, I suspect we won't know until Thursday.<p>I can think of a couple of scenarios that might fit what we know so far:<p>1) Apple might simply declare that they want 30% of all in-app purchases. Amazon will likely freak out. This, to me, would seem to be a seriously dangerous move on Apple's part.<p>2) Apple may drop the 30% cut entirely on in-app purchases. That'd be pretty disruptive but aside from adding a technical hoop to jump through for content providers to link content with Apple's in-app purchasing system, I don't think they would be quite so upset about it since they wouldn't really be losing money on each transaction. Of course this is still pretty harsh on Apple's part, IMO, but it's better than #1.<p>3) Apple simply requires developers to link purchased digital content with an Apple ID via the in-app purchasing system, but not necessarily requiring that Apple be used for the actual money transfer itself. The purpose of this would likely be to ensure that purchased digital goods are always linked to an Apple ID - even if they were purchased externally. If that's the case, then this is much less of a big deal, IMO, and a huge win for users. For instance, if you restored your device, you could be assured that all your digital content you bought via the Kindle app itself would be restored with a single tap - no need to login to Amazon again or anything like that. Thus Apple can help better ensure that the user will actually get their content back when the device restores which is required of all other in-app purchased content using the in-app purchase API.",1296587072

But I would say that perhaps your overall SO experience would be better if your comments on SO were less abrasive. Your answer might have been ""right"" based on your assumptions (i.e. the user has JavaScript enable in the browser) but it might not have been right if some other assumptions were made.",1296586982

If you're so attached to your words that this pains you, then a wiki site really isn't a good fit for you.

I think you made your point, although I think MS did a good job neutralizing it too.<p>My question for you Matt... is there any way for Google to build a toolbar that effectively does what the Bing toolbar does (or even a joint one?).  I jump to use the various search engines because no single search engine is sufficient.  But clearly when Google isn't sufficient, you don't get the value of when I go to Bing.  And vice-versa (as I don't use the Bing toolbar currently, but that may change now).  Or do you feel that with 65% of the market, you don't need this info?",1296586859

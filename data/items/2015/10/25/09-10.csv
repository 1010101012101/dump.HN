Thanks for saving my time! :D<p>I&#x27;ve been running it for the past few hours to put backups of my photos to Glacier. I have zips of each album which vary from a few megabytes to a few gigabytes - in total it&#x27;s around 40GB. My internet connection isn&#x27;t that reliable, so around half the uploads have failed with &#x27;Connection Interrupted&#x27;. It would be great if they were automatically requeued (maybe at the end of the list?) and were able to be resumed without starting from scratch (I assume behind the scenes uploads are multipart?).",1445767058

Kindness and terror,  beauty (natural) and ugliness (man made).<p>I say &quot;fortunate&quot; because of the (a) new perspectives gained while being there; (b) having the pleasure of working with some of the brightest and hard-working people I have ever worked with; (c) being part of a project that has helped empower tens of millions of people.<p>The most beautiful place I ever went in over 40 countries I have visited was the foothills of K2 mountains, and watching a Polo match at the birth place of Polo in Baltistan (despite my Indian wife and I being surrounded by 15000 men chanting &quot;Death to India&quot; while war raged on in the SWAT valley a few hundred km&#x27;s away).<p>A last footnote.

10446490,comment,10446067,10446377,0,0,smelendez,,,"Here are some of the arguments I&#x27;ve seen:<p>-- testing itself takes a lot of time away from instruction, sometimes days at a time for each of multiple tests.<p>-- In addition to learning the material that&#x27;s officially tested by an exam, students are forced to study the idiosyncracies of the exam: how questions are phrased, how graders expect to see written answers, etc. That takes more time away from studying actual curricular material and forces students to focus on something they, their parents and their teachers all find silly and boring, reducing respect for the education system.<p>-- The material that&#x27;s on the test is often the lowest common denominator for what students should know, calculated over a US state or group of states. This means there will be material that&#x27;s not on the test but that everyone thinks in a particular community thinks kids should learn (history, art, music, etc.) or even that most people in a state think should be taught but a vocal minority oppose (comparative religion, black history, evolution, etc.). That material will be left off the test, and a teacher won&#x27;t have time to cover it because he or she has to spend all the class&#x27;s time on stuff on the test. If a science test will never mention Neil Armstrong or Neil deGrasse Tyson, a teacher has no incentive to mention either of them, and may even be penalize for doing so at the expense of more practice with the density formula.<p>-- Teachers are evaluated based on test scores, often to the exclusion of other factors. This stresses teachers out at test time, which causes them to stress students out. Students come to dislike school and learn less.<p>-- The tests are sometimes flawed, but by the time people realize the results are wrong, their results have already factored into policy, personnel decisions and student placement.",1445766972

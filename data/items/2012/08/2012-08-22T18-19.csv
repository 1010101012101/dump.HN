This also works for restaurants and other things on sites like Yelp. It almost seems that a movie should come with a simple ""recommend!"" button that simply counts recommendations.<p>But ratings are a tricky issue and I think they require a more sophisticated mathematical treatment and modeling if one wants to get it right, not just a few histograms that treat all people equal.<p>There are a few modeling challenges that come to mind: For example, people disagree on quality of movies based on their taste. This could be modeled as a latent variable that must be inferred for every person in some graphical model. Another example of a relevant variable would be person's rating habits: some people rate movies 5 or 1, some people have a gaussian rating centered at some value. These should be explicitly modeled and normalized. Every rating could ideally be used to make a stochastic gradient update to the weights of the network, and since we are dealing with very sparse data, strong priors and Bayesian treatment seems appropriate. Ratings could then be personalized through an inference process on the graph.<p>Has anyone heard of a more sophisticated model like this, or any efforts in this direction?

It probably doesn't make you happier; contemplating your money rarely does. Instead it will alternately make you worry (as every dip in the stock market causes nightmarish visions of a retirement spent in a cardboard box), or make you irrationally exuberant (as every good trading day makes you dream of buying a second home). The net effect is that it will subtly encourage you to <i>trade</i>, because if you don't trade your 401k is the most boring thing imaginable, and you feel the subconscious urge to tinker with it to make it <i>do something</i>. But trading is a disaster, because churning your investments makes other people rich at your expense, and because timing the market doesn't work, and <i>telling</i> yourself not to time the market usually doesn't work, either.<p>For much more on this topic see the work of e.g. William Bernstein (<i>The Four Pillars of Investing</i>, <i>The Investor's Manifesto</i>) or any of the so-called Bogleheads, or try Ramit Sethi:<p><a href=""https://wordsofward.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/the-single-best-investment-choice-intro-to-index-funds/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wordsofward.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/the-single-best...</a><p>Here's another example: The ideal amount of time to spend monitoring your weight is <i>none</i>, unless your weight is unhealthily large or is increasing significantly. (If you're prone to anorexia, a continuously updated dashboard showing your weight is potentially dangerous. You need to <i>avoid</i> playing that game.) And unless you're some sort of edge-case athlete, by no means should you monitor your weight daily: You should either weigh-in weekly, or weigh yourself daily but compute a running average (and have a deep understanding of what a <i>running average</i> is and why you're computing it). Otherwise day-to-day fluctuations are likely to destroy your confidence in your diet. (I'm told that, for this reason, Weight Watchers explicitly trains members to weigh-in weekly, not daily.)",1345660086

There are also other cases where using a large pile of cash can push you ahead of the competition and secure the entire market.<p>But if I had to guess, I'd wager that many, many startups are not in this kind of situation.  They aren't in a capital-heavy field, and burning down a big pile of cash isn't going to make them the industry leader and crush the competition.  I think more startups could be served better by simply focusing on solid business fundamentals...and it amazes me that <i>just now</i> are startups realizing that.

The solution they adopted was to display not the mean of ratings but the <i>percentile</i>: a photo rated higher than 76% of other photos would have its ""average"" displayed as ""7.6"", even if the mean was 4.5.

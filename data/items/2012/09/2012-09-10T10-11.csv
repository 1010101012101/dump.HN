(Honest question; As a long term Mac OS (X) user who switched to Linux about a year ago I am really wondering...)<p>Also, has a heavy computer user I mainly switched to Linux/FreeBSD because of the much improved customization possibilities. While the default OS X experience might be superior to GNOME/KDE, I now get a lot of things done a lot faster since I could make my machine exactly fit my needs. I really cannot imagine why any (not platform depending) programmer would ditch Linux for OS X just because the defaults work better.",1347274779
4499165,comment,4499111,4499111,1,0,jmiseikis,,,"Hot Air Balloon tourism in Vilnius is gaining popularity due to relatively low price and the unique opportunity to fly over the city. Only two more cities in Europe allow Hot Air Balloon flights over the city - Helsinki and Stockholm. Its a very rare occasion that flights are allowed over the the international airport, not only Europe, but probably anywhere in the world.<p>VNO approach Air Traffic Control (ATC) has special arrangements with balloon pilots allowing them to fly in one flock, they have to take off within 10 minute interval and all the communication is done with the leader of the group. Once the balloon is right over the airport territory, it has to ascent to 1km height in order to allow planes to go under, while in the close proximity its opposite, they go down allowing planes to fly over.<p>In general, such flights are possible only because of good relationship between Hot Air Balloon pilots and ATC who have full control of the situation, so it happens even when some planes approaching the airport. Every situation is handled individually.",1347274675

Of those that do, many of them will be unable to sustain it to 2k customers and run it profitably for half a decade.<p>With regards to the new knowledge that 20k customers is possible, that just gives you something to shoot for next, right?  There's something you can do that starts at 2k users today and gets you to 20k users.  You know that is possible, because other people have done it.  So work on that.  (Knowing from previous conversations that you're rate limited on customer acquisition by processes other than marketing I'd suggest, as the Slicehost guys did, ""automating the ""%#)(% out of everything"" and then focusing on customer acquisition as your primary job, if that is a huge priority for you.)<p>More broadly: philosophically, if we consider ourselves failures for not doing things other people have done, then we'll all be failures essentially all of the time.

4499158,comment,4498074,4498074,4,0,jorangreef,,,"One way to help is to ask for lower level OS apis to be exposed by browsers, so that the open source community can do the rest:<p>1. Ask for UDP to be exposed to trusted web apps installed by the user. This will let the P2P community race ahead without having to wait for WebRTC to get released and then fixed.<p>2. Ask for TCP to be exposed to trusted web apps installed by the user. This will instantly enable things like SMTP clients running in the browser without the need for WebSocket proxies/proprietary gateway servers.<p>3. Ask for POSIX to be exposed to trusted web apps installed by the user. This will lead to an explosion of database innovation in the browser. IndexedDB is design-by-committee. Insist on proper POSIX not the FileSystem API. Borrow from the Node API. Impedance mismatch is crippling browser storage.<p>4. Low-hanging fruit: ask for LevelDB to be exposed directly (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=128865"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=128865</a>). Most of the browser vendors are using LevelDB underneath IndexedDB, and just exposing LevelDB directly would already be a huge leap forward. No need to wait for the many IndexedDB bugs to get fixed by browser vendors.<p>Browser vendors are trying to do too much. Innovation needs to move from top-down to bottom-up. Browser vendors need to provide just basic access to bare metal and let OSS do the rest. UDP, TCP, POSIX would be a great start.",1347274477

Because of that, I absolutely agree with many of your points about TV drama and family life.<p>However, I actually am using ""real"" very similarly to your definition. If porn has an impact on cultural practice, sex that is influenced by porn is real in that way, and so is sex influenced by romantic novels. We probably are less aware of the latter, though, since the ubiquity of porn on the internet is a newer phenomenon.<p>The quote you use sounds quite sex-positive. But please also note that the article uses ""real"" in quotes (sometimes even capitalized), so it is fair to assume that Gallop uses that term extensively as well, and probably in a judgmental fashion.

After that article he really began hating all over Android due to the fall-behind.<p>Basically, Google mostly abandoned the stock browser because they wanted to focus everything on Chrome for Android. They accomplished this last year, and it fixed virtually all the HTML5 complaints that have been leveled against Android. Chrome is only supported on Android 4+.

That the restored Proudin-Gorsky images are more fabrication than an honest attempt to faithfully render the data contained in the original images in a way that is psycho-visually accurate.<p>But one can make the very same case that Technicolor and Kodachrome and every other photography technology that has ever existed, is as much fabrication as reality. What I'm not seeing here is any evidence to backup the assertion that these particular images are less psycho-visually accurate than if they had been rendered in a different common style. Sure, with Photoshop and/or other software, you have a much bigger toolbox for messing with reality than you used to have in a darkroom, and you can consequently do all sorts of things that I <i>would</i> consider to be more fabrication than representation, but I've seen no evidence yet presented that this is what has occurred here.<p>One thing that we seem to agree on is that the style that has been used for many of the renderings is an HD video style. One of the things that I was taught by film professors is that the reason that video looks ""cheaper"" than film is that video is actually more accurate in a lot of ways than film, and we've just been trained by our culture to view the less accurate rendering in film as more classy. I don't know if this claim about film being less accurate than video is true, but if it is, then this might explain why an attempt to render the Proudin-Gorsky images as accurately as possible would end up with them looking like HD video.<p>I wouldn't, however, be surprised to learn that the images were not rendered as accurately as possible, and the HD video style was specifically chosen, but that choice would also make sense, psycho-visually. If we're not used to seeing photographs rendered in a form as psycho-visually accurate as is possible, we might not experience them as accurate due to our cultural bias.<p>If, on the other hand, you are not implying that the wool is being pulled over our eyes and are only stating that the Proudin-Gorsky images have been rendered in a a modern style rather than in a Technicolor or Kodachrome style or in the style that you would have seen if you were to have seen Proudkin-Gorsky project them with his lanterns, then point taken.

4499077,comment,4495914,4496937,5,0,waterhouse,,,"Yes, it <i>is</i> ok.<p>If the only thing stopping me from doing horrible things was that I haven't yet <i>imagined</i> doing them, then I and everyone around me should be terrified of me.  Fortunately, my self-control seems to be a little stronger than that.  Though it is not helpful for everyone to be told by implication that they have permanently terrible self-control (or any similar implication). [1]  Fortunately I seem pretty good at dealing with such implications, although I am less confident about other people.<p>(Some articles have repeatedly appeared on HN, to the effect that when gifted kids are taught that ""gifted"" is an unchangeable property of a person and has nothing to do with gaining skill by repeatedly playing with something, they tend to stop putting a serious effort into doing anything new and challenging--for fear they'll screw up and have to accept they're not ""gifted""--and so they tend to stop or severely restrict their mental growth, becoming rather less ""gifted"".  Now imagine how this applies to self-control.)<p>I just did picture murdering my family over dinner with a fork.  I decided the idea holds no attraction to me, and is pretty stupid.  I am not worried about deciding to do it in the foreseeable future.  Feel free to explain how this situation is not ok.<p>(Nor do I think the idea will repeatedly come back to me in the future and I'll panic and try to think about <i>anything but it</i>, and only end up thinking more about it, until I lose sight of anything else and just do it because I don't know what else to try.  --I have the impression, from some books I've read, that that's one way some initially sane people end up doing crazy things.  In this scenario, the panic is obviously an exacerbating factor, and it stems from the belief that ""I'm thinking about something horrible [or have been thinking about it for what seems a long time]"" => ""There's something wrong with me and I won't be able to stop"".<p>My solution is contempt for that belief, and for other people who believe it.  Like, possibly, you.  (This should be combined with some sort of escape valve--if you conclude that everyone else sucks, you need some way to deal with that, and if you don't have such a way, then you may start panicking if you come close to thinking that everyone else sucks.  I just assume that, no matter how high a percentage of other people appear to suck, there are people like me, and eventually we'll get together and make a good society).  Meanwhile I have contempt for the horrible idea, because it is not special amongst the many other horrible ideas--let's imagine them!--and if I were vulnerable to doing them, then I'd probably have done one of them already, which I haven't.  And in the unlikely event that I do keep thinking of it a lot, my working hypothesis will be that it's just self-caused by anxiety foisted on me by taking seriously, on some level, the words of people like you.  ...I have read of a case where someone said that he did keep having murderous thoughts, and that this coincided with the development of a tumor in his brain; I guess it might be possible that the latter could cause the former somehow, though now that I know of this, I would still not panic, or if I did it'd be about cancer, not about the murderous thoughts.  A brain tumor with such specialized effects seems very unlikely in any case.)<p>Anyway.  This little exercise, picturing your scenario, reinforced my confidence in my sanity and my ability to decide not to do other horrible things.  I'd say the experience was positive for me.  So, <i>why?</i>  There you have one answer: an exercise to prove one's sanity.  (Again, I do not respect someone who <i>would</i> do horrible things and just doesn't because he hasn't thought of them yet.  I would hope such a person would learn and grow stronger than that.)<p>And there are use cases for putting detailed, horrible, evil things into media productions--not breaking reader's immersion, teaching people about their vulnerabilities so they can protect themselves, and sheer enjoyment for other reasons I'm not sure of.  I wrote up a couple of examples, but they made the comment too long, so here's just one, which I write about because it's fun:<p>----<p>In this clip from the anime series Death Note, the main character Light Yagami, who (unbeknownst to anyone else) is the evil killer Kira, confronts Naomi Misora, a former CIA agent and the fiancee of an FBI agent whom Kira recently killed.  She has some very compromising information about Kira that she intends to bring to the police; Light wants to kill her to prevent this, and he needs to learn her real name to kill her.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1ISK8Z0gN4&t=8s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1ISK8Z0gN4&t=8s</a><p>Light lies to her, learns some personal details about her, compliments her, learns more details, learns that she trusts him (for the wrong reasons); exploits her trust and what she's told him to make her a (completely fake) offer he knows she'll really want; pretends to back off from it to avoid suspicion (while continuing to compliment her and extend the offer); and adds a comment (""But you're young and beautiful... don't risk your life for this"") that sounds like more backpedaling, but which he knows will actually bring out her fierce loyalty to her fiance's memory and induce her to say yes.  She accepts, and tells him her real name; he writes it in his Death Note (pretending it's a normal notebook) and kills her, making her jump in a river so it looks like suicide.<p>I consider this pure evil--in particular, noticing her admirable qualities of trust and loyalty and determination, and making them work against her; and conducting the whole conversation with a straight face until he kills her.  I also find it kind of beautiful.  Meanwhile, I would be repulsed at the thought of me or someone else actually doing this sort of thing (I'll classify it as ""observing and manipulating someone through conversation to get them to give you what you need, then seriously harming them"") to someone I knew.<p>What is the value of my seeing things like this?  Well, I don't expect to understand fundamental reasons why I like things, but I can make up guesses, and an obvious one here is: Knowing an archetype of pure evil, I can be better prepared to deal in real life with examples of impure evil that approach the archetype to varying degrees.  (Also the pattern-matching part of my brain will be more likely to notice if <i>I</i> start doing things that approach evil.  Also, it might help me understand other people's reactions if I unintentionally do things that look like evil.  Though, for the record, looking like evil is not evil, and using force to stop or punish someone who merely looks like evil is unjustified.)<p>----<p>I'm glad Falkvinge is addressing this issue.  It had to be done, sooner or later.  And he makes a powerful case--especially section 2, I dunno about section 1.  (I'm impressed... I know of the ""humanitarian with the guillotine"" pattern, where a naive, doesn't-examine-the-secondary-consequences-before-acting, but generally goodhearted politician makes a well-intentioned law that ends up hurting people more than it helps.  I'm familiar with the mental tool of imagining that a law was made maliciously, to figure out what the bad consequences might be.  But I keep being faced with the conclusion that it's more than a mental exercise: that all pieces of legislation were in fact originally put forth by people with anti-social intentions.)<p>[1] John Holt explains, with several examples, how some groups of people (but not others!) have come to think that children are reckless and uncoordinated and dangerous to themselves and others, and how their resulting treatment of children causes children to exhibit exactly those traits, in ways they do not when they are not so treated. <a href=""http://pastebin.com/LkBd4VhN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/LkBd4VhN</a>",1347272710

That being said, the best thing you can do to sell it is put it on sedo and godaddy with a low BIN price. You can also email site owners that could be interested in the subject of your domains. Though again, a brandable domain like the one you posted will most likely not be attractive for a person who has already established his business. If you have generic domains, the story is quite different. A good generic .com domain will give you great results in an auction. You can check with the adwords keyword tool to see hou many exact match searches are done for your domain keywords every month. If youre looking at anything below 10k searches, its not a good domain. My personal expectation, being a long time domainer, is to have more than 160k exact searches per month.<p>In my experience, the best results ive had have been through Sedo. Ive sold 26k usd with just 6 domain sales. They were generics and I just put an ""asking for"" price and let offers come through. You have to be patient though.",1347271874

Even if this is not the case: You stay at a company that only pays you fair money when you threaten to leave. You look disloyal to the old company (see point 1, even if not now you might get fired later) and unreliable to the new one. It also perpetuates the ""no raises, we'll just make a counteroffer if necessary"" mindset which probably made you seek other job in the first place.",1347271765

Important is to optimize the title and meta tages for SEO. Put the site up, wait a few months and see if anyone comes to you. If your site starts ranking in google you will get people's attention. What is key is to know if your domain has value, and if it does to know how to negotiate.",1347271372

Could be that student A good lucky with assignment 1 and student B got lucky with assignment 2, and they messed up the other assignment in turn.<p>Another possibility could be that the long hour students did all the actual hard work and the fast students simply got to copy their stuff. At least at my university, that is how most students dealt with the maths assignments.",1211496637

197618,comment,197182,197612,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I didn't say anything in my list was ""Linux only"".  I said, ""I use so few ""Linux only"" applications that it would probably be easier than ever to switch"".  So, basically, I was saying, there aren't very many Linux only apps anymore that I use regularly, but that my style of working would be uncomfortable on Windows or Mac.<p>So, my statement agrees with yours, I think.<p>I have worked in Windows environments quite a bit when doing contract work, and I'm familiar with Cygwin, but it's not an acceptable command line environment--the way it chafes when doing anything outside of the Cygwin environment is too much friction.<p>Mac OS X is slightly better now that it has bash by default.  But its system tools are weak compared to those found on Linux systems.  I feel this same pain when using Solaris and FreeBSD.  In all three cases, it's possible to install good versions of those tools, but I have to retrain my fingers to call gawk instead of awk, etc.<p>Again, it would be easier than ever, because vim has good versions on both Mac and Win, and Perl runs fine everywhere.  Firefox and Thunderbird, too.  But retraining myself to work in the Mac or Windows way would be uncomfortable.  And I hate being uncomfortable.",1211495458

For windows you may have to install Cygwin or PowerShell to get a respectable prompt.<p>I use a windows box at work. I use Mac and Windows at home. I recently switched from Ubuntu to OSX and I ran into many of the same problems initially. I wanted things to work exactly the same as Ubuntu and that just wasn't happening. After about three months I learned many of the OSX shortcuts and finally configured and set up my linux programs for OSX. Now it's all good.",1211494724

You no longer own the company if the investors hold two seats on the board to your one (and if they get veto on who the outsider is, they definitely hold two seats).<p>You are always allowed to negotiate until paper is signed (or until you've shook hands on the deal), but it sounds like these folks are either testing your mettle or just hostile investors.

From this example, if the Einsteinians had invented an AI without having the hardware spontaneously melt, it would have escaped into the Einsteinian world.

So they did (if indirectly).<p>But people like to act like Twitter owes them something.  Fact is, it's a free service.<p>In the spirit of building their business they clearly want -- in fact they need -- to build the best product they can; the fact that it's taking too long by <i>our</i> estimation doesn't matter.

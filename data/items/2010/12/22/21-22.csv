Here are a couple more details:<p>* Our team of devs have collectively built over 450 websites.  We know the domain well.<p>* We also did a lot of UI design early on that guided some some of our work.<p>That said, we didn't just design and give birth to a great API.  We have iterated on a it a lot. Our clients were going on HiFi 6 months prior to the public release.  We learned a lot and iterated on the API quite a bit during that period.<p>What ended up being nice was the ability to make sweeping changes at one point (the API) that benefited the entire application.

Polygamy would have continued for generations without the intervention of the federal government. The LDS church spends millions of dollars to support continued discrimination against gays.<p>Until 1978 blacks could not hold the priesthood in the LDS church. Some quotes from the ""Book of Mormon"":\n2 Nephi 5:21-23:<p>""And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.""<p>""And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.""<p>""And cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.""<p>""And because of their cursing which was upon them they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey.""<p>3 Nephi 2:15 reads:<p>""And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites.""<p>Mormon leader (""Elder"") Mark E Peterson:<p>""The reason that one would lose his blessings by marrying a Negro is due to the restriction placed upon them. 'No person having the least particle of Negro blood can hold the Priesthood' (Brigham Young). It does not matter if they are one-sixth Negro or one-hundred and sixth, the curse of no Priesthood is the same. If an individual who is entitled to the Priesthood marries a Negro, the Lord has decreed that only spirits who are not eligible for the Priesthood will come to that marriage as children. To intermarry with a Negro is to forfeit a 'Nation of Priesthood holders'....""<p>""If that Negro is faithful all his days, he can and will enter the celestial kingdom. He will go there as a servant, but he will get celestial glory.""<p>Etc etc.<p>Notwithstanding the cowardly, brain-dead, head-in-the-sand intellectual compartmentalization others are advocating here, I doubt any of us would be commending the SEO efforts of other organizations that have the kind of sordid history and unfortunate social passions the LDS church has had...and isn't shy about paying for.",1293054897

But insulin needs to be produced to assimilate glucose. Your subordinate clause could only be true if fructose were simpler than glucose.<p>Also, your subordinate clause could only be true if fructose were <i>less</i> difficult to assimilate than glucose. It's not. It's <i>more</i> difficult. It has to be converted into glucose in order to be metabolized.<p>Dates and figs, staple foods throughout human history, are over 20% fructose by weight.  Many fruits and vegetables derive more than half their calories from fructose and, in a few cases, fructans. Throughout the evolutionary development of our diets, fruits and vegetables supplied the majority of our calories.  So saying fructose ""simply didn't exist in modern quantities during the evolutionary development of our appetites"" is false.  Fructose could indeed be a major cause of health problems, but not because it was a small component of our ancestral diets.  It might be a slightly larger component today, but I suspect it's actually considerably less because of the higher protein and fat content of modern diets.<p>Metabolic rate per kilogram varies widely among people, and within the same person over time. Epidemiological studies have shown that, at least in the US, heavier people have a much lower metabolic rate per kilogram, to the point that heavier people generally tend to eat <i>less</i>.  There's lots of speculation on why this is — do they have thyroid disorders? are their bodies conditioned by widespread yo-yo dieting? do they get less exercise? — but I'm not aware of a consensus yet.",1293054142

That was just FUD (largely from IBM).<p>Here's what there actually was. There are older documents, from a variety of older programs (not all Microsoft, BTW), that do things that cannot be represented in OOXML (or ODF, for that matter).<p>There are many organizations that have documents in those formats, and have tools that understand those formats. E.g., a law office might have a lot of Word Perfect documents, and might have tools that understand WP format and can automate various things involving those documents.<p>Such organizations might want to update their document store to use a more modern format, like OOXML or ODF. However, they might need to preserve some of those things in the old documents that are not representable in the new format.<p>Suppose the standard says nothing about this. What should they do? Simple--they will find some way to add that extra information to the document. Both OOXML and ODF provide a couple of ways that one could include non-standrd. So what would likely happen is that everyone who deals with old documents would come up with their own in-house way of embedding this extra information.<p>Eventually, people would get smart. We'd realize that if you are embedding information about WP5 line spacing options in your OOXML or ODF conversions from WP5, and I'm embedding information about WP5 line spacing options in my OOXML or ODF conversions from WP5, then we should get together and agree to do it the same way--and we should get everyone else involved. We should come up with some kind of industry standard for storing WP5 line spacing options in documents converted from WP5 to OOXML or ODF.<p>Same goes for a bunch of other things from old word processors and spreadsheets. We'd eventually end up with a bunch of industry standards for all of these for OOXML and ODF. Hopefully, we'd combine them all and have one standard.<p>OK, now back to what they actually did in OOXML. They simply realized people would be doing this, and so reserved some names for them. That's all. Nothing in the OOXML spec said that you have to support WP5 line spacing, or know what it means, or have your OOXML programs be able to do it. All the spec said was <i>IF</i> you are going to extend the document to record WP5 line spacing (or the other specific features of old formats they identified), <i>THEN</i> use this as the name of your tag or attribute or whatever that marks it.<p>They also said that new documents should not use these things. It was strictly for people who were converting old documents and needed to keep that information.<p>I've yet to see anyone offer a rational objection to this.",1293052885

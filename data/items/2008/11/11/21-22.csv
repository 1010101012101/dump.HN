They live in a parallel world that has nothing to do with the country they are in. They would do the same everywhere they went.<p>To me, it seems to be a waste. Why travel to a new country with a new culture, and take your old culture with you?<p>And quite beside that, I find this attitude of the expat upper class a bit elitist, and it goes against the things I believe in. I believe that if one lives in a country, one should attempt to understand and interact with the local culture and traditions, and not create a society that totally ignores these norms.",1226440724

However, in John and Kyle’s case, experience is what they wanted and what they got from their adVenture. They certainly believed in their product, but unlike most entrepreneurs, their startup’s journey was more important to them than its ultimate destination.</i><p>I'm always fascinated by the ""journey"" more so than the ""destination"". In this case, The MouseDriver Chronicles sounds like a great story. Added to my ""To Read"" list!",1226440697

361015,comment,360664,360664,0,0,liuliu,,,"haha, I am a Chinese! There are indeed rare geeks to start up companies in China. Din Lei, the founder and CEO of Netease(NTES) is a geek. Ma Huateng, the founder of Tencent is a geek, too. So, somehow, Netease and Tencent are the two local companies with strongest human resource in development.<p>For decades, there is no emerging startups with solid and independent business ideas. Even some startups I know have a profound background in technology, things they do are not new. Shang Mail, a copy of Blackberry push mail have a solid tech team. Ucweb, copy of Opera mobile in China was invested by Lei Jun, someone can be compared to Paul Alan in China.<p>There are some reasons for this.<p>1. New ideas have no tech or patent barriers. Due to the mess patent applying process and all the people to review applications are not professional. The quality of China patents are very low. It is hard to find valuable patent and sue someone with that. You can find all kind of patents in the database, from perpetual motion machine to how to compile linux kernel.<p>2. Due to No.1, new ideas can be copied by large companies. Tencent copied twitter model, Sina and Netease copied blog model. Merely startups survived in the battle field with large companies.<p>3. Chinese investors are conservative. That is good thing from some perspectives, they value the cash flow beyond everything else. Thus, if you don't have a persuasive revenue model, you can not raise any money. A most persuasive model is a copycat of successful service in other countries.",1226440513

361004,comment,360914,360914,0,0,lbrandy,,,"An interesting dichotomy occurs when he mentions ""optimizing"" for digg versus how to optimize for hacker news. Ed (edw519, I presume) says.. no.. just... be yourself. Be sincere. Don't try to game the system.<p>For a super-high traffic site like digg, it becomes absolutely paramount to get your hooks into people because you don't have alot of time to make an impact. An extra marketing once-over on the submission is virtually required (not to even mention going a step above to rigging the system with some quid pro quo or dummy accounts). It makes digg largely unappealing to me from a submissions stand-point because, first, the traffic is of low quality, and secondly, it seems... uhm... unsavory.<p>For a lower traffic site like this with a super narrow focus, it's much easier to get noticed. And the traffic is of extremely high quality (presuming you are on topic...) You are in the new queue long enough that your story is going to live or die on its own much more than the magic title, etc.",1226439949

You can only track the most likely conversation threads and attempt to meet them as readily as possible.<p>The problem is, unlike in chess, there are no restrictions in a conversation. The trick with programming a really believable bot, I think, is not to brute-force it, but to create some sort of emotive simulator. Something that shifts the bot's mood as time goes on. That way, you're able to make the responses more believable, even if you don't anticipate responses to each line.<p>The reason brute force doesn't work is because the <i>human</i> mind can't always anticipate things. However, we know why we don't anticipate things. We're able to tell when other people's responses are absurd and don't make sense; we can choose not to follow threads. Look at the snippet I posted above: the computer responds to everything as if it's logical conversation, which it's not. If a robot can't tell that, then the next step is to teach it how to tell.

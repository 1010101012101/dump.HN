Had someone without Meijer&#x27;s intent gone for a LINQ feature, maybe a different approach may have been taken.

8516267,comment,8515311,8515311,0,0,Binky_Bob,,,"Granny-to-Guru in 12 weeks is clearly unrealistic.<p>What about a mid-career move from infrastructure/operations with significant experience with Perl / Shell / etc. programming? Or a COBOL / C++ / Java developer that&#x27;s been stuck in corporate-land for the past 20 years? Or a business analyst that&#x27;s been pushing excel sheets and access databases around for years, maybe with some BI tools sprinkled in for fun. There are a ton of relatively experienced &quot;computer people&quot; facing uncertain times as cloud environments close down corporate data centers, and outsourcing eliminates developer jobs.<p>The current dev environment is bewildering to say the least -- you don&#x27;t just learn Javascript -- to be effective you need to learn a ton of other things -- HTML, CSS, Jquery, test-driven-development, grunt, git, various frameworks, jasmine, node and/or ruby on rails (or equivalent), pair programming, etc. Each of those leads down its own rabbit-hole of complexity and extra tools to know.<p>It seems like these bootcamps, done well and with the right sort of student, would give a massive &#x27;level-up&#x27; into the current dev world. For mid-career types where there is a need to minimize time away from a paycheck, a 12-16 week program is a good fit.<p>There are few realistic alternatives:<p><i></i> Go back to school for a CS degree, working on it nights, maybe with tuition re-imbursement from work. -- This is insane -- schools don&#x27;t teach the above, they teach algorithms and specialize in toy projects, not the real world. Doing it part time while at your day job just adds years to the process putting you even further behind.<p><i></i> Start or contribute to open source projects. This is easier said than done as it pre-supposes a knowledge of and familiarity with using the above stack of tools or their equivalents. For the dedicated self-starter with a lot of determination and energy to stay up at night doing this it could work. People with kids and other commitments would find it very tough.<p>I don&#x27;t think the bootcamps are going to turn a fine-art major with no prior computer experience into a $100,000+ web developer in 12 weeks. I _do_ think that it could turn a $90,000+ corporate programmer or infrastructure person into a $90,000+ web developer, now with a foothold in the world of the &quot;cool kids&quot; and an escape hatch from the stifling corporate world.",1414425458

8516247,comment,8509213,8509560,0,0,paypaul,,,"I think the whole thing can be flipped. Assign the lectures as homework. Do the homework in class. This is exactly how Khan Academy (<a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.khanacademy.org/</a>) is structured.<p>Technology opens up entirely new teaching methodologies. We should be encouraging mastery of concepts rather then praising good marks on tests. What does getting 80% on a test mean. It means there was 20% you didn&#x27;t know. I sure hope that 20% wasn&#x27;t important. When you consider that concepts build upon each other that 20% deficiency compounds  pretty quickly. It leads to students thinking they are stupid when maybe there was just a concept early on they struggled with and never mastered that has caused them to stumble from that point forward.<p>I breezed through High School only to later stumble with high level university Math courses.<p>Khan Academy has helped me correct this problem and I think it should be integrated into the school system. It demands mastery, it is addictive to use (earn points, achievements) and it standardizes the lecture quality. Being able to watch a great teacher on video and having control of the pace (fast forward, rewind) is a much better use of time then copying notes off a blackboard.<p>Teachers can have a dashboard view of how all of their students are doing and exactly what concepts each student is struggling with. Smart students can take it as far as they want without being slowed down. Students that are struggling can get help in a much more constructive way (and can stop being convinced they are stupid). Teachers can use class time to actually help the kids learn something. Pair students who excel with the ones that struggle and use them as tutors.<p>Make the classroom a collaborative experience. That&#x27;s where I think things need to go.",1414425323

In other words, the infrastructure required to deliver them (which includes people, not just servers) at a place like Amazon isn&#x27;t trivial in cost.<p>And then there&#x27;s the author&#x27;s need to earn a respectable living.  Obviously that equation produces different numbers based on whether the product (the book being the product) sells a thousand vs. a million copies per year.<p>If a publisher is in the middle then they need to make money to offset their fixed and variable costs.  The presumption is that they provide the author with valuable services.<p>I&#x27;ve paid up to $200 for privately published eBooks on very specific subjects from authors with deep expertise in the matter.  In this case the authors undertake the entire task of producing the book, often hiring people to help edit, format, illustrate, etc.  I wonder how the economics of such ventures works out.  In all cases the books have always been worth every penny.<p>One of my pet peeves with Amazon is that they don&#x27;t offer eBooks in PDF format.

An equivalent moral case is broadcast TV ads. You aren&#x27;t obligated to stay in the room and pay attention; going to the kitchen, using Tivo, and flipping channels are all morally ok.<p>Part of the reason that subscriptions and micropayments haven&#x27;t caught on is that people put up with ads. If ads stop working as a business model, I doubt we&#x27;ll be looking at a bleak future of watching Love Boat reruns and rereading old Family Circle articles. We will find some other way of funding good content.<p>Indeed, when I look at the way the quality of television has improved over the last couple of decades, I think it&#x27;s a reasonable argument that blocking ads would be the moral imperative. As anybody who has worked in ad-supported industries knows, consumers aren&#x27;t the customers, they&#x27;re the product. Rather than being served, viewers and readers are being served up to advertisers. The system has a conflict of interest at the heart of it.

8516141,comment,8514990,8514990,0,0,robomartin,,,"Kudos for sorting this out quickly.  Problems like this one can be really difficult to debug.<p>I remember one case where the coefficient table for a polyphase FIR filter we implemented in an FPGA caused huge instability problems in a design.  The coefficient table, if I remember correctly, was 32 wide (32 multipliers) and 128 phases long.  That&#x27;s 4096 numbers.  The design had about 40 of these tables that would be loaded from firmware into FPGA registers in real time as needed. We built a tool in Excel to be able to compute these tables of FIR coefficients.<p>We got word from a customer that things were not behaving correctly under certain circumstances.  We were able to reproduce the problem in the lab but could not find anything wrong with the FPGA, microcontroller or Excel code after about three weeks of work by three engineers.  This quickly became a nightmare as it threatened several lucrative contracts and failed to service our existing customer base adequately.<p>I had to put our other two hardware engineers back to work on their existing projects so I took on the debugging process.  This was the most intense debugging I&#x27;ve had to do in thirty years of software and hardware development.  Lots at stake.  The very reputation and financial well being of my business was at stake.  Enter 18 hour days, 7 days a week.<p>FOUR MONTHS LATER, at 2:00 AM on a fine Sunday morning without having slept for three days looking at code the bug jumped out at me.  We&#x27;ve all had that moment but his one was well &quot;one of those&quot;.  The problem?  We used &quot;ROUND()&quot; in instead of &quot;ROUNDUP()&quot; in calculation that had nothing to do with the FIR filter coefficients but rather affected the programming of counters related to them.  This caused timing errors in a state machine that drove the FIR filters.  If this were software this would be exactly like having the wrong count in a loop counter.  Yup.<p>I re-calculated after making the change and everything worked as advertised.  That was the best Monday I&#x27;ve had in years.  And I took a long vacation after that.<p>Over four months to find a bug.<p>That&#x27;s why sometimes it is impossible and even unreasonable to create budgets for software development.

Something you can&#x27;t do through a boot-camp (luckily you can learn learn this in many ways other than programming, and many people encounter it throughout their lives). Until you can get past that hump, a lot of programming is spent just learning why the computer is &quot;choosing&quot; to do what it does, and is really wasted in the context of learning to build applications. Once that happens though, things get rather quick, and it&#x27;s more about handling a lot of breadth, rather than depth. (This is ignoring more advanced CS concepts, which are a whole different beast than just making products).<p>I have been mentoring a friend who wants to learn to build mobile and web apps. Same situation the author proposes, an English major who realized he doesn&#x27;t really like his options. It has been less than a month, but he&#x27;s surprisingly good already, better than any of the undergraduate CS students I&#x27;ve tutored (however, the CS undergrads who write great code don&#x27;t need tutoring, heh). We haven&#x27;t touched web/mobile yet, but we&#x27;ve begun building programs together. A flappy-bird clone using PyGame for example, that we later plan to rewrite as an app. I think working so quickly towards making full-fledged finished products keeps it very fun, and you get to see how ideas work when combined with other ideas, something universities don&#x27;t often do outside of end of the semester projects.<p>I&#x27;ve been focusing more on teaching him to teach himself, rather than outright learning languages or frameworks. In 6 months he won&#x27;t be a rockstar, but I fully believe he&#x27;ll be able to make his own projects from scratch, and be able to jump into any teams projects with a reasonable amount of time to familiarize himself.<p>I think what really helps is that he already has a great grasp on concepts in programming that are so foreign to newbies. I don&#x27;t know how, maybe all the experience we have playing pen-and-paper RPGs. It only took me an hour or so to teach him about classes for example, and he was able to understand the difference between a class, an instance, static and non-static methods, or structuring conditional statements. When I tutored, I spent 90% of my time just trying to drill in these concepts. And if he had needed a ton of time to fully grasp the difference between references and objects, inheritance, or even a for loop, he just could not have progressed so quickly, and even if he did, I feel he would not fully understand what is going on in the code, and would take it away with an understanding more like taming magic, rather than a tool and a science.<p>(long comment, haha.

The gramophone, and recorded music in general, did destroy the live performance.  People listen to much less music live, even as they listen to more music overall.  It&#x27;s also much harder to make a living as a mid-level professional musician even as the few at the top make millions.  That said, I do think these are positive changes: excellent music in huge varieties is much more widely available than in pre-recording days.<p>(The aspect of the change that makes me most ambivalent is its effect on people making their own music.

Targeted advertisement is not only based on what ads you click, but also the sites you visit and the stuff you view on them. If targeted advertising only worked based on what you&#x27;d click I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with it since I never click ads and it would be that easy to opt-out of it.<p>Targeted advertising itself is a whole other thing. In order for it to work, they need to gather data about you and this doesn&#x27;t always happen in obvious ways (e.g. clicking on an ad) and that means you can&#x27;t always opt-out of it, which makes it a breach of privacy in my book.",1414422810

That was enthusiastically accepted by the team and from there we ended up writing more and more things in Clojure.

Now lets say a lots of people switch from blocking ads to giving them fake clicks and now half the clicks on my ads are from this extension.  Y% drops by half, because half the visitors from this source are now just browser-extension bots, so I&#x27;m only willing to bid half as much.  But so is everyone else, which means my new 1/2 x $X x Y% bid is still competitive, and there&#x27;s twice as much traffic to bid for, so it all comes out the same.<p>Ad networks take click-fraud very seriously because it&#x27;s important to their reputation, but the market is actually pretty robust to it.<p>(Plus this browser extension sounds like it would be really easy for the ad networks to filter out.)",1414422486

On some level I&#x27;ve known that a script like this could be easily written for a long time, but seeing this working product really made it clear. It&#x27;s unlikely that millions of people would use something like this, but if they did it would be chaos in the advertising industry. They love online ads because it allows them to gather empirical metrics that can&#x27;t be gathered from television or radio. It&#x27;s impossible to know objectively what kind of an impression a tv made, but you can see exactly how many people clicked on a banner.<p>But this could also be a fatal flaw. If a lot of people wanted to, they could destroy payperclick advertising. It would be almost impossible to know which clicks were real and which were fake. Companies would lose a lot of faith in the industry because an update to the script could play havoc with the online ad budget of this company or that on a whim. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would chose the attack the online advertising industry and it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea, but it&#x27;s interesting to that it&#x27;s possible. Online ads is a huge market space but also one could also be severely disrupted by a greasemonkey script.

It took my son about 5 minutes to talk me into spending 5 pounds on the first game.<p>It also provides instant access to any music in my Amazon account, giving me one more reason to consider putting my music there.<p>In other words: This is a sales channel with massive potential.

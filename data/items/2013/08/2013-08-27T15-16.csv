That sounds a lot like &quot;supernodes&quot;, where Cisco runs the supernodes.

If so, that disqualifies Meraki.

That&#x27;s the first step towards unmitigated disaster. The next step is to fall into a hole that you can&#x27;t get out of without a whole lot of work, and have to solve a problem that those frameworks you should&#x27;ve used in the first place have already addressed.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that code you understand today quickly turns into code you don&#x27;t understand in the future.

In fact, black scholes is more descriptive of option trading than predictive of option valuation. Since there needs to be an active market for this to be relevant, I wouldn&#x27;t use it for thinking about startups.<p>That said, these highfalutin financial concepts are definitely applicable  to startups, but really the question is &quot;what do you think the terminal value of your startup is?&quot;<p>If you think you have a shot at owning a big chunk of a billion dollar company, the value of that shot is:<p>(Probability of success) * (Terminal value)<p>If the undertaking has a 1% chance of being worth 1,000,000,000 and 99% chance of being worth nothing, then the whole opportunity is worth about ten million dollars.<p>So, yeah.

The US is by far the one requesting the most data. I&#x27;d have to run the numbers to be sure, but it looks like even controlling for population and number of FB users, the US is definitely outpacing other countries&#x27; data requests.<p>2. The US is the only country where FB is reporting in ranges instead of precise numbers. There could be several reasons for this, but the reason almost certainly is not that they don&#x27;t know the precise numbers. NSLs seem like a safe bet here.<p>3. The US also has one of the highest &quot;success&quot; rates of government requests. 79% of government requests yield some data. This again could be interpreted several ways, but the two most enticing ones are that the US isn&#x27;t sending a lot of fishing requests because when they request data from FB, they&#x27;re already pretty certain about what they&#x27;re looking to find. The more disturbing concern would be if the US only queries FB for things where the NSA&#x27;s database is insufficient, which would mean the number of requests they submit to Facebook is not at all indicative of how many queries on user data they actually do.<p>EDIT: Here&#x27;s a quick Gist I made of this report as a CSV.

Here&#x27;s some relevant quotes from an article I found[1], I&#x27;ve heard a few programs about the prison system during that period on the radio:<p><pre><code>    Before 1977, all California prisoners had an indeterminate
    sentence. They were given a range of time in which they 
    would be imprisoned, with five years to life being a 
    common sentence. To be freed, inmates had to prove to 
    the parole board that they deserved it, which could mean 
    enrolling in reform-oriented programs, learning a trade, 
    or taking classes. The aim of indeterminate sentencing 
    was to rehabilitate prisoners and, when they were ready 
    to reenter society, free them.
    
    Although the system had its flaws, it also had its 
    successes. According to state statistics, just 15 
    percent of inmates released in 1977 returned to 
    California prisons  an extraordinarily low recidivism 
    rate in comparison to today. Nonetheless, in 1977, then-
    Governor Jerry Brown signed a law that completely 
    overhauled the state&#x27;s sentencing system, switching the 
    focus from rehabilitation to punishment.

There were a series of actions and evolution at the state level that eventually provided the necessary preconditions for Nazi Germany to exist. I&#x27;m sure that what ended up being Nazi Germany was one of several path that Germany could have taken given those necessary preconditions that permitted its existence. We don&#x27;t know what those other paths are, one of those paths could be where we end up instead. What is known, is that this ever widening gap permits individuals, possibly several acting in concert and possibly in the belief that they are doing the right thing to exert undue influence upon the political decisions of the country for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many. The two wars we have become embroiled in unnecessarily are prime examples of such acts.<p>We probably won&#x27;t become Nazi Germany.

Live in a &quot;food desert&quot;, and fresh produce may be difficult to acquire.  Live in certain places in my metropolitan area, and an evening walk for exercise presents its own not inconsiderable risks.<p>Nonetheless, many people these days seem included to think of insurance as akin to a savings plane.

This sort of hair trigger reaction, with out being sure of the facts, fits with Schneier&#x27;s idea of of irrational revenge thinking in the UK government. Not enough facts, but still acts or pronounces. Its not getting it wrong that is the issue, its the too quick to act or pronounce bit I find significant. I thought it a dangerous sign at the times I saw it.<p>I have to say, I don&#x27;t believe the US government had anything to do with initiating the detaining of Miranda. I&#x27;m sure they would have been informed, but I suspect their reaction would have probably been something like, &quot;OK if that is what you want to do, fine. Its your country, your laws. We are happy to accept any thing you share as a result&quot;. I believe this was a 100% British action, while the US offered no objections. And why should or would the US gov object to it? So, as as far a the US gov is concerned in this specific action; fair enough, I say.<p>What I think Schneier is missing is the British pathological need to be the USA&#x27;s BFF (For grown ups: Best Friends Forever). That has always been the vibe here in the UK, but it became real when a story came out about a message personally given to ex PM Tony Blair as he took office by the UK Ambassador to Washington. IIRC, it came out in the Iraq war inquiry. Blair was simply told essentially this, &quot;With regards to the Americans, crawl as far up their backsides as you can, and make damn sure you stay there&quot;. Yes, although that is not a direct quote, the advice was worded in that direct coarse way. Presumably, David Cameron clearly has had the same advice.<p>Looking back, it seems clear to me that we Brits have behaved thus since WW2. And lets face it, from a rational cold UK POV, it is probably the right advice. If you cant be the big man, have one as your best buddy. And, didn&#x27;t the UK owe the US a few dollars to rebuild after WW2? Im sure it was the case prior to WW2, but WW2 cemented it.<p>On the surface, all fair enough, really. But, in extremes like the Snowden affair or post 9/11, it seems obvious to me how this relationship can get very out of hand, and how invisible pressure can influence people in to dangerous areas. I suggest it happened to Blair, its now happening to Cameron.<p>So, I kinda agree with what Schneier is saying, but I think its more to do with proving UK worth to the US government than pure desperate revenge. A British sacrifice on the alter of the US government, given willingly and freely, as a very keen junior partner.",1377616149

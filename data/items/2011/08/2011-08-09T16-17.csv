2864729,comment,2863793,2864156,1,0,fuzzylizard,,,"Excellent comment. Far to many developers concentrate on becoming a better programmer to the complete exclusion of becoming a better software developer. Software development is all about how well you can deliver business value and the ability to program, although an important skill, is not the most important. It is simply one of many, many skills that are needed.<p>Like the comment above, my advice is learn how to deliver software instead of just program. Learn how to interact with customers and become an expert in your business' domain. In addition, learn how to solve real problems without using technology or programming.<p>Being a great programmer will get you in the door for an interview, but it is all the other soft skills that will get you the job (and the money that you want).",1312909036

Explicit variable declaration is a throwback inherited from statically-typed language, where a variable's type must be declared before use, and has no place in a dynamic language.<p>> It's just too prone to typos and broken scoping to be worth it.<p>Predeclared variables are just as prone to typos, which will also break your code -- and just as prone to broken scoping. By accidentally shadowing an external variable you make it unreachable for the remainder of the current function, and all nested functions within.<p>Clearly, declaring the type of a variable is not necessary in a dynamic language, so the only purpose of a variable declaration is to manually mark it's scope, shadowing any potential name conflict.<p>There are <i>no</i> situations where shadowing a variable is desirable. It's always best to be able to reach any variable that exists in the current lexical scope, should you find the need.<p>The only ambiguous situation in which you'd want to use a ""var"" on purpose is to explicitly shadow an external variable of the same name -- if you accept that shadowing is undesirable, and choosing a more descriptive name for the inner variable is preferable, then QED.<p>Dynamic languages should not have variable declarations.",1312908989

  near you. You know  the butterfly effect on a local and tangible
  basis. Consumers hurting in Detroit or Biloxi will not continue to
  spend money they dont have and income theyre not earning. It will
  impact retail. It will impact brands. These companies advertise. On
  your tech platforms. These consumers buy iPads, iPhones,
  Androids. Youre counting on them for up-sells to your app. For buying
  virtual goods. You need consumers  theyre 70% of the economy.

  Trouble is  they dont have jobs. Those that do still have too much
  debt. Their 401k aint what it once was and it just got whacked
  again. They still have too much personal debt. And the equity in their
  house isnt rising. Theyre doing what economists call
  de-leveraging, which means spending less, saving more.

            [2, -1,  6],
            [5, 10, -1])

why not adapt a simpler syntax for constructing multi-dimensional arrays:<p><pre><code>    m1 = [1   2   5;      # commas are optional
          2, -1,  6;
          5, 10, -1]
</code></pre>
Also, a special constructor for matrices and vectors is redundant - in a mathematical language, a list/array is the special case, not a matrix/vector. Besides, vectors are just a special case of matrices, no need to treat them differently, especially since the dot product is not overloaded in Calculize.<p>Matlab also wins by having a special syntax for matrix transpose. Now, this depends on the implementation ( AFAIK, Matlab doesn't actually transpose the matrix, it simply uses a different algorithm for further calculations), but would still be nice, since it's often useful (necessary) when trying to multiply matrices.",1312907737

It's really unknown (both to the people they're suing and to The Hurt Locker) whether or not the case will succeed.  Right now, there's a huge incentive for the individual to settle since the case might see the individual lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.  With loser pays, maybe the loss goes from $100,000 to $120,000.  However, on the other side, courts might start finding that The Hurt Locker has no case.  In a loser pays system, The Hurt Locker could then be out the $20,000 for every suit they've filed.<p>It puts pressure on people filing a case to make sure they have a good case and aren't just trying to extort a few grand out of someone that will have to pay more money to defend in court.  It puts pressure on defendants that are actually in the wrong to settle for a reasonable amount. In cases like this (where we might not have a great indication of where courts will go), it puts pressure on both sides not to overreach.  The Hurt Locker wouldn't be suing 25,000 people if they might be on the hook for paying those people should a court decide against them.  They'd be more cautious - test the waters, see what happens.<p>Loser pays is generally seen as protecting the small player.  First, they can't claim unreasonable legal fees - they're often decided by the court.  Second, usually loser pays incorporates the amount sought.  If they're seeking $100,000 and they get awarded $10,000, they're the loser (even though they won an award).  That would keep them from asking for too much in their suits since a jury might award actual damages and a little bit more.  Likewise, in some areas arbitration processes are used in the process.  For example, two legal teams sit down with the arbitrator who looks at stuff and determines an amount $X that seems fair.  You think you deserve $10X so you go to trial.  You only get $X.  You wasted the court's time and money and are on the hook.<p>It puts pressure on people who are in the wrong to settle and puts pressure on those in the right to accept reasonable offers.  Right now, there's no real reason not to sue.  The Hurt Locker is pushing out these suits since it's a little administration without a downside.  If they could be on the hook for thousands of dollars to those they're trying to sue, they'd think twice about it, about the amount they sued for, and about whether they were sure about the strength of their case.",1312906371

They attempt to make programming simpler for designers to work with and instead end up with a language that is too complicated for a designer and a completely new syntax for an engineer.  Now, it takes more time for anyone to work with it.<p>For example, no need for var declarations.  Well, wait a minute, how do I as an engineer scope a variable then?  In javascript, scope is determined by functions when using a var and is global otherwise.  Are all variables global?  Or are they just in a namespace?  Or are they all scoped as if they had var in front?  Things like this will trip me up all the time and I will always have to refer to documentation.<p>For designers, mostly they don't want to work with functions and variables anyway, how big of a benefit is it that they don't need a var and there is only one way to declare a function?

Being in the right means being more likely to prevail in a trial - this could be represented by a percentage.  We also need to consider that there are people who are not very realistic in assessing the strength of their case.  Let's call them irrational.  That gives us the following possibilities:<p>A. big v. big 
B. little v. little 
C. big v. little<p>1. big is clearly in the right (>90%)

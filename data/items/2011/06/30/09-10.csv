Those operate very efficiently, with computers and mechanized things,"" Deuell said. ""I don't want to doubt their word and their intentions; I just don't see how they bring 5,000 jobs to the state.""<p>Texas and Amazon have been at odds over the collection of online sales taxes since last September, when Comptroller Susan Combs sent Amazon the $269 million bill, covering sales taxes it failed to collect from 2005 to 2009.<p>Amazon responded by saying it would close the Irving facility, eliminating 119 jobs. Amazon also said it was scrapping other plans to expand in Texas, accusing the state of having ""an unfavorable regulatory climate.""\"",1309427920

An example is, why do potatoes from Cornwall get sold in Yorkshire and vice versa since both areas could be self-sufficient in potatoes? Why are we wasting fuel, vehicles, truck drivers time (and their whole lives really) shifting potatoes around depending on the market price? A more extreme example is that New Zealand apples and lamb are sold in the UK, both of which are readily available from this country, not only at different times of year. I've even seen ""Organic"" New Zealand apples in Sainsburys. Well they might be organically grown but certainly not organically produced overall if they're shipped halfway around the globe. Another bugbear I have is, here in the East Midlands we have freight planes landing and taking off at night. Some people aren't getting a decent night's sleep so that others can get Mange Tout and sugar snap peas from Ghana or wherever. So in summary if you want the planet to be a nicer less stressful place with less lorries and planes, try to buy local!",1309424883

No matter what the tax rate was, you could ask if folks like living in a modern society.<p>Very, very rarely do I find people who want no government or crippling taxes. The question, as you point out, becomes ""how much is too much?""<p>So can we please stop describing other people's opinions in extreme ways? (I mean that for both sides)<p>I'm in favor of allocating a certain percentage of GDP to various governments. Say 15% to national, 5% to state, and 2% to local governments. Let the governments themselves decide how to collect it.<p>This does two things: it gives a real number instead of a bunch of arm-waving, and it puts government on a budget. Historical records show us that you're not getting much more than 20% out of a population anyway (and that's forgetting the Laffer curve)<p>You can always argue for more or less government and taxes. Both positions are perfectly fine. What's not fine is making this out to be socialism versus anarchy. It's really much more a conversation about finding compromise and being able to spend as much as you tax, instead of having politicians vote for programs nobody can afford and then pointing their fingers at the other guy when the bill comes due.<p>As for your question about living in a modern society, I'd argue we're paying about 20x more than we need to for these services, mainly because there's no choice involved. As governments continue to clamp down with taxes and more ""help"", there will be less and less choice, thereby making the multiplier even higher.<p>There's nothing wrong with believing that yes, we need these things, but no, this is not the way to have them. Doing the wrong thing with good intentions and a good goal is still the wrong thing. :)",1309424451

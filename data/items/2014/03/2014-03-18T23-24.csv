7425956,comment,7418583,7425197,1,0,Dewie,,,"> If you don&#x27;t think the fact that Louis CK is Mexican but everyone thinks he&#x27;s American plays into why and how his comedy works, we can agree to disagree. :)<p>So how does his audience being ignorant of something, aid him in his comedy? How can it help him if people don&#x27;t know of it?<p>Assume that they think he is a white American - then he looks like a typical white guy, making racist jokes (presumably, I&#x27;ve never seen them). The fact that he&#x27;s really Mexican is not known to most people, so people will just think of him as a typical white American.",1395187167

Raytraced scenes are much easier for artists to control the results because things actually behave like you would intuitively expect (if the amount of rays is high enough).<p>If raytraced scenes were hard to control, why would every single animated movie be raytraced?<p>Raytracing really is the be all and end all of graphics. The more rays you can render, the more realistic your scene will be, up to 100% realism.<p>Of course, we can come pretty far with the hacks as well, and it&#x27;s hard to say if hardware raytracing can come close to the quality hardware shader hacks can achieve on traditional GPU&#x27;s in real time.",1395187166
7425954,comment,7424829,7425712,3,0,sentenza,,,"I find it to be one of the most horrible misconceptions about life that you have to be securely &quot;settled&quot; before having kids. Many older new parents (aruound 35-40) I observe struggle a lot more than we (30) do with raising small children.<p>People tend to underestimate both the amount of stress that small children are and the gradual reduction of stress capacity that comes with age. You are good at pushing yourself to the limit? That&#x27;s great. How do you cope with 24/7 low-level stress for months without _any_ break?<p>My wife and I decided to do the kids thing early in life (relative to other academics) and now are finished with our family planning while yet having to reach any sort of &quot;steady career-path&quot;.<p>Best choice ever.<p>But I must add that I do this with the strong social safety net of Germany in my back.

There is a point where Seattle streets are saturated such that adding cars increases traffic and congestion without reducing cab time from point A to B. There is also a point where the supply of taxis meets the demand exactly.<p>Currently, we have little data to say where these points lie on the number line of &quot;taxis&quot; in Seattle. If the first point is less than the second, the city should place a limit at that point. If the second point is equal to or less than the first point, then the city can set the limit at an arbitrary value equal to or greater than the second point and let the market sort it out.<p>Either way, by regulating the quantity of taxis, the city can slowly increase the limit to find the optimal solution.",1395187070

Raster shadows are easy to get subtly wrong and very difficult to get right. Cube-maps are easy to get subtly wrong and very difficult to get right. Transparency is easy to get subtly wrong and very difficult to get right. The list goes on.<p>> Even in AAA games, there are tons of artifacts in the shadows. Same goes for reflections.<p>Exactly! I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve seen shadows pointing in the wrong direction, having the wrong color, having the wrong penumbra/antumbra, casting through solid objects, etc. Cube-map reflections are even worse (yay for faucet handles reflecting forrest scenes) especially when they&#x27;re moving. Expect to see a reflection slide up the body of a car as it comes to a stop? If you&#x27;re not in a car-racing game, forget about it.<p>All of those problems can be overcome with artist sweat and tears. The code has already been written and is in the big engines, but the effects still regularly fail to happen in AAA titles.<p>Ray-tracing makes it easy to do things right. None of the raster techniques have achieved that landmark. This WILL be a game changer.",1395186797

He is a staple at nearly every startup event -- Startup Weekend, Geekwire events, TechStars, VC panels, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t have a dog in the fight, but I did spend some time reading the actual bill since these blog articles felt like more political campaigns than informative pieces.  The last time this came up I posted <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7303232"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7303232</a><p>The Seattle city council passed a law that made so-called &quot;ride sharing&quot; services legal after intentionally withholding prosecution for over a year.  The law isn&#x27;t perfect, but it does feel like it strives to balance protecting existing investments with new services.  The most salient changes about the bill:<p>1. Seattle defines uberX, Lyft, etc as Transportation Network Companies (TNC) and declares all drivers as &quot;for-hire&quot; drivers, which is a legal distinction that means Seattle can regulate them.<p>2. TNCs are taxed at $50k for first year. Second year is the greater of $50k or .35% of gross revenue.<p>3. No more than 150 drivers may be associated with each TNC at a time, and each driver can work only 12 hours per 24 hour period.  Previously the law would have limited 300 drivers per TNC per quarter regardless of who was active, and this was &quot;the cap.&quot;  For comparison, there are 1100 taxicabs in the city.<p>4. Drivers can&#x27;t double dip: They can&#x27;t both drive for-hire cars and also do uberX on the side. They also can&#x27;t work for both uberX and Lyft.<p>5. Rates may either be flat-rate between preset zones OR subject to RCW Chapter 19.94. RCW Chapter 19.94 defines appropriate measurement devices that may be used with commerce, which I think precludes most cell phones... uberX would need to install meters it seems and precludes surge pricing.<p>6. The insurance requirements are stricter than what uberX or Lyft provide today and are mostly in line with existing taxicabs.<p>7. There was a 30% increase in the cap on cabs at the same time.<p>8. TNCs have to report their activities to the city, which will be available to the public for inspection.",1395186557

7425858,comment,7425303,7425513,10,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Ray tracing works backwards from the way actual optics works. It sends out a ray for each pixel and then finds out what it falls on then does math to figure out what it should look like. In a simple example, you have a few light sources and you trace a ray back to an object (polygonal surface), then you shoot off other rays from there toward the light sources (or you shoot off potential reverse reflection rays). If something is blocking a light source you adjust the amount of shadow being rendered or you bounce off of that surface again toward the light sources, and so on. Making it possible to render shadows, reflections, and so on with decent fidelity.<p>In contrast to that technique you have &quot;radiosity&quot;, where the illumination at each point on a surface is calculated based on its environment. Radiosity is better at rendering diffuse light, ray tracing is better at rendering reflected light.<p>The underlying difficulty is that illumination is a maddeningly combinatorial problem. In principle every part of every object in a scene contributes illumation to every part of every other object. The light falling on a desk lamp from the LEDs of a clock also illuminates the desk itself, and so on. Radiosity and ray tracing attempt to solve those problems by making simplifying assumptions and performing a subset of the calculations necessary to illuminate and render a scene completely faithfully. In principle a more proper ray tracing algorithm would be to send out a huge number of rays in every direction for every image field ray, then follow each of those through their evolution, sending out yet more for surfaces each fall on, and so on. But that&#x27;s far too computationally intensive (it&#x27;s an O(n!) level problem).<p>Path tracing is similar to these techniques but makes different simplifying assumptions. And the most important aspect is that instead of deterministically calculating everything in a specific way it uses a monte-carlo method of statistically sampling different &quot;paths&quot; then using the data to estimate the resulting illumination/image rendering. Path tracing results in a compromise between ray tracing and radiosity of being able to render both reflective and diffuse light well, though it has its own short-comings.",1395186079

How much the US is an outlier.<p>2. How huge the gap between current practice and reasonableness is.<p>The US spends more than the rest of the world combined on weapons and soldiers. It is likely that intelligence follows this ratio. US military spending is near a historic high in constant dollars. But there is no Soviet Union. There is no military threat that can touch US territory. And yet we spent $TRILLIONS on overseas wars and incurred similarly staggering future liabilities for injured people and worn out materiel. We did 90% of that spending <i>after</i> our adversaries - the &quot;bad guys&quot; as they are referred to - had no weapons larger than a rifle. Not one aircraft. Not one armored vehicle.<p>The answer is not to &quot;split the difference.&quot; There are not &quot;two equal sides&quot; to the story. Yes, there must be some state secrets. But none of what Snowden revealed needed to be a state secret. We are no less secure now than before Snowden. What that tells us is that every bit of secrecy around those documents was gratuitous and so were the secret programs themselves. All that secrecy did was to make us less free.<p>So let me challenge you about &quot;either extreme.&quot; Let&#x27;s say someone walked out of Ft. Meade tomorrow with a copy of <i>everything.</i> Including what the NSA knows about every state secret in every department of the government - let&#x27;s assume that&#x27;s everything. And then posted it openly on the Internet. Obviously extreme. Obviously irresponsible. Obviously some spies and informants would die.<p>But would that create an existential threat to the US, or not? Would it materially reduce the security of the American people? If not, why not work backward from that &quot;extreme,&quot; of having no state secrets at all in small steps, until we have a reasonable and manageable number of state secrets.

And they are clearly the <i>wrong</i> thing to do, for the individuals involved and for society at large.<p>I realize that you probably didn&#x27;t mean to include all those decisions as valid in your sweeping case for non-judgemental social norms, but the fact is that norms are incredibly important because, especially when it comes to family, decisions do affect other people. If we can agree that some norms are important, the only discussion is about which are important, why, and how much.<p>I&#x27;ll go one further and defend social diktat since it&#x27;s probably not something most people consider. Given that norms are important, I&#x27;d rather people enforce these norms outside of the laws. The norm used to be that gay sex was a bad idea. People were (and are) thrown into prison and legally executed because people decided to turn social norms into laws.

I agree with him and plan to migrate to the scheme soon, as there are a few people using my libraries.<p>With that said, I doubt very much it will make it into the official toolchain. There&#x27;s really no point if it can be offered just as well by a third party. For example, godoc.org has proved invaluable but isn&#x27;t official.<p>Also, keep in mind that gopkg.in is still pretty new, and I believe Gustavo has said that adding support for other web sites or revision control systems is perfectly doable. Just wanted to get something started for the lowest common denominator, I suspect. :-)",1395183665

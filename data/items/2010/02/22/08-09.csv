Kills any instrict motivation, and sends a group towards a path of mediocrity as it delegates all decision making/creativity on the team lead (manager, or mp).",1266828691

The record industry is really good at printing one hit wonders and then burning them up.  Those are probably the guys who are making the songs you are referring to.  This is not unique to rap, it happens in pop,  alternative, rock and roll, heavy metal and any other genre.  I could easily say ""metal is just screaming"" or ""alternative is all the same crappy guitar chords"" and I would be kind of half right some of the time.<p>If you take a look at some of the more accomplished artists with staying power you will discover thoughtful lyrics and complicated music.  Jay Z has been getting more and more musical over time.  The American Gangster soundtrack was an explosion of funky horns and beats that really set the tone of the album to that of the film.  Death of Autotune doesn't have an electronic note on the track.  This is not to mention the vast pool of talent in the underground hip hop and rap scene, which is something you should really investigate if you are going to give the genre an honest examination.<p>If you don't care for rap music that's fine, but saying ""it all sounds the same"" just makes it obvious you don't ever listen to rap music.

I have also been going thru Chubby (Google's distributed locking service) and the various literature on it that is available online. My fundamental usecase for Zookeeper is to implement replication and general coordination for a distributed system.<p>I was just wondering though, what is the specific advantage that Zookeeper or a Chubby like distributed locking system brings to the table. Basically I am just wondering why I can't just use a MySQL NDB Cluster. I keep hearing that MySQL has a lot of replication issues. I was hoping some with more experience on the subject might shed some light on it.",1266825853

Whether you make a library that is GPL and include it in a non GPL program, or you have a GPL program and want to include a non GPL library, both cases require all code to be released as GPL.<p>The GPL does not care about ""library"" verus anything else. The GPL <i>is</i> somewhat oriented around the constructs of C, but there have been clarifying guidelines from the FSF and in general its not hard to see how everything fits in for another language.<p>The LGPL, on the other hand, makes specific exceptions for libraries which are linked into an existing application. So long as a proprietary application is using the library in such a way that it could be removed and replaced for another compatible version, it is not considered a derivative work under the LGPL and is not subject to release.",1266825801

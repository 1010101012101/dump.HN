None of them are games of chance.<p>This <i>would</i> be a game of chance if it was ""pay $10 and you might win, but we won't tell you until the end"" instead of ""pay $10 and if somebody pays $11 we will tell you so that, if you chose to, you can bay $12.  This cycle will continue until the item reaches a point that nobody is willing to spend more for the item""<p>This is not a game of chance because you get to CHOSE if you are going to win, and they TELL you if you will before the conclusion of the auction (or game, in your description).<p>You <i>ARE</i> simply confused about this, because it isn't possible for a rationally thinking person to make the argument that you are and mean it.",1243316670
626322,comment,626051,626310,0,0,ch00,,,"I think that's a compelling irony of the data if it can be taken as accurate.  Perhaps material goals are the most efficient means of (material) progress, but is there psychological cost associated with that achievement?  Reminds me of ""Death of a Salesman"" and the ""illusion of the American dream"" school of thought.",1243316579
626321,comment,626051,626310,0,0,ellyagg,,,"Let me put it another way:<p>1. Benjamin Franklin wrote that when colonial era children were taken by Indian tribes and were later found again, they usually didn't want to come back. Their lives were too easy and carefree now.<p>2. Egyptian society didn't change for thousands of years. The weather was mild and the Nile would flood every year, providing them plenty of easy food. There was no need to strive for anything.<p>If happiness is the most important virtue to optimize in society, then I'm forced to believe that pre-colonial American Indian society and ancient Egyptian society were far better than modern societies. But I don't believe that.<p>Believing in happiness as supreme is a first principle. You can't prove it, you have to accept it as a given and the rest of your philosophy descends from that. Personally, I don't accept this assumption. I think happiness is important, but I think other things like beauty and truth are just as important.",1243316522

If you can just move one step at a time BUT KEEP MOVING, soon, you'll arrive.<p>That's what i did when i finished my marathon last year. Just one step at a time, no matter, how much i hate it (especially started from 30km+). The metaphor of cry from sadness to joy and everything else is so spot on pj!",1243315156

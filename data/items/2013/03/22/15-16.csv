If anyone has a counter point I would certainly love to hear it, as I will freely admit to not having had much interaction with the Perl community as of late.<p>I might, if I knew what your point was.  There's just a vague implication that the language and it's ecosystem are substandard to Ruby and Python.  Apparently you think it's self evident, so doesn't require explanation, but I don't feel that way, so I'm not sure what to address.<p>Mind supplying some examples of what you feel Perl is lacking in comparison?<p>To jump start it, I've been using Mojolicious[1] lately, and find it a dream to work in.

In general, code executed by computers tends to be executed more ""rigidly"", but in some systems humans can also be quite automaton-like in just executing instructions. In those cases it's not clear the human operators, rather than the algorithms they're executing, are in control of the decisions (it may not even be true that any one human <i>knows</i> what algorithm is being executed).

You're clearly renting access to a catalog of goods in this kind of model, and therefore it makes sense that you'd want to stop people from permanently acquiring copies in such a scenario, especially if you're selling actual DRM-free downloads at the same time (in my ideal digital store where it makes sense they would offer both of these side-by-side). The catalog subscription model has some clear value to it, and I'd hate for it to disappear due to ""technical unfeasibility"".<p>As such, I would at least prefer for most of the tech / architecture to be based on HTML5 stuff instead of closed plugins like Flash, Silverlight, Widevine and so on. I can't really think of a good solution to this, unless you got the big wigs at various publishing outlets to accept that to do HTML5 streaming, you can only make downloading the rentable versions inconvenient for regular versions (instead of being able to use a heavy-weight closed DRM plugin), but I'm afraid that could be quite challenging. It has worked for Adobe and webfonts, though[1], so maybe there's hope. Forcing HTML5 to be DRM-free could eventually lead to this direction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.typekit.com/2009/07/21/serving-and-protecting-fonts-on-the-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.typekit.com/2009/07/21/serving-and-protecting-fo...</a>",1363967059

This ticks me off, because having known such people I can no longer discount the possibility that any FUTURE minority person that I meet with the trappings of success is one of them.  Most aren't.  Most got there on their own merits, against all odds.  But the nature of business is that a bad hire frequently costs much more than the opportunity cost of waiting to make the right hire.  And that pushes you to not give the benefit of the doubt.<p>In particular I witnessed watching a black woman who had played the race card her whole life getting kicked out with a masters in math despite objectively knowing less math than I expected from undergrads.  At the same time a much more competent white man who had a block in ONE subject area (and enormous success in many others) would have been kicked out with no degree at all if I had not taken a month of my personal time out to teach him all of topology.  And a third person, an undergraduate black from England who had never received any preference, took an extra quarter to finish a well-earned masters on top of his BSc.<p>All three frustrate me in different ways.  I hated seeing the ridiculously easy qual she was given compared to the rest of us, in written take home format yet, with a blind eye turned towards the fact that she was begging other grad students to do it for her.  At the same time a student who had worked much harder and done much more got no breaks at all from the system.  And in parallel I saw a truly deserving minority student, and know that for the rest of his life upon first meeting someone like him, I'll need to unfairly suspect his deserved accomplishments until I know him better.<p>Yes, I recognize the historical injustice.  Yes, I recognize the barriers.  But our current affirmative action policies give some a lottery ticket at the cost of perpetuating the problems into future generations.  That's not what we need to do.",1363966977

Dual Core A6 is entirely competitive with the Snapdragon S4 in the new Nokia on a CPU basis, and while the quad core Snapdragon in the U.S. version of the Galaxy S4 will have more cores, it's not clear phone software can effectively use the extra cores.

The Adreno 320 in the new HTC One and the 544MP3 in the international Galaxy S4 simply bring Samsung and HTC to parity with Apple's 6 month old phone (and the Adreno 225 in the Nokia 920 is comparable to the GPU in the iPhone 4s).<p>The iPhone 5 owned the benchmarks when it was released: <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/6324/the-iphone-5-performance-preview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6324/the-iphone-5-performance-...</a>.<p>There are certain design decisions Apple makes versus its competitors.

Why?  Drawing from our high level, theoretical explanation, some people with big bucks went to Congress, twisted some arms, crossed some palms, etc. and got the law passed (I'm omitting details, but they are likely not very important to this exercise).  Who with the big bucks?  Some organizations with computer or Web sites that didn't want to be 'hacked' -- to use the crude meaning of this word common in CFAA discussions.  Then when the law was passed, the big bucks people could smile, congratulate each other, go for drinks at some Capitol Hill watering hole and celebrate how much they really stuck it to the 'hackers'.<p>Second, Swartz writes some scripts or some such, parks a computer in a closet, lets it run, and downloads ""millions"" of 'documents'.  Essentially every file he got is also available for free in any research library in the world or to anyone on the MIT network from JSTOR.  And Swartz had no very good way to distribute large numbers of those documents or get paid much for his efforts.  And JSTOR had a heart to heart with Aaron who promised not to do that again or some such.<p>Third, the ""millions"" was enough to serve as raw meat to some prosecutors in the Boston office of the DoJ.  Then the 'case' went forward as in our theory:  The prosecutors were already in big gumment too big:  That is, long we tried not to have criminal laws at the federal level but to leave such to the states.  So, in this sense the CFAA should have been a Massachusetts matter.  Next, prosecutors in small, local parts of gumment answer fairly closely to the voters, but the Boston office of the DoJ answers to voters very indirectly or not at all.  Next, one of the Boston prosecutors wanted to get publicity to 'move up' in gumment, e.g., run for governor.  That in reality her ""overreach"" would hurt her chances of elected office and maybe even end her career in gumment was lost on her.  Instead she was apparently a bit slow between the ears and in the old school of ""the law, the law, the letter of the law"".  Of course the Boston office of the DoJ should have been throttled by the DC DoJ, AG Holder, or even Obama, but was not.  Why?  One might look at Holder and guess that he wanted to project an image of a tough guy, i.e., show the 'little people' how he and big gumment really are the big boss.  And Obama likes to avoid involvement and just ""vote present"".  And Obama can be fairly sure that one case in the Boston DoJ office won't much hurt his reelection chances.  Or, the Congress, the Boston office of the DoJ, the FBI, the DoJ itself all have a lot of power, and as we know ""power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely"".<p>For the NSLs more generally, those seem to be part of a pattern:  Whenever the civil liberty people want to throttle wire tapping, poking holes in our Constitution, etc., lots of gumment police and prosecutors come out of the woodwork and scream that they really need these laws to catch the bad guys.  So, the police and prosecutors are always screaming for more power.  They really like power:  Now police cars have automatic license plate readers and a computer and a wireless connection to do a lookup on the owner of the vehicle and check on, say, the date of the latest state vehicle inspection.  No doubt all that electronics in all those police cars costs a lot of money, but apparently the police really like the power.  Well, when 9/11 provided an excuse for a lot more police power, the police got a lot more power, and we shot holes in our Constitution.  People in big gumment keep grabbing more power.  Don't have to be a anti-gumment 'libertarian' to see that big gumment has gotten much more powerful over the last few decades.<p>Here's an example:  We had Secretary of State C. Rice say ""We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud"" and her statement that the aluminum tubes were for use in uranium enrichment centrifuges.  She got away with both statements; both were taken seriously in the media and, apparently, our political fora.  Of course, both statements were, to quote from 'All the President's Men', ""total BS"".  Saddam had made no significant progress to being able to create a ""mushroom cloud""; it was easy for nuclear technology experts to confirm that the tubes were not suitable for centrifuges; and the US DoE had already told Rice that.  Still, our media and politics are so gullible for stories of threat that her ""total BS"" was influential.  Or, last night I watched again the old James Bond movie ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" about a wacko newspaper mogul who was thrilled to notice ""There's no news like bad news."" which is much the same as the newsroom standard ""If it bleeds, it leads"", which some people say rests on some fundamental human psychological vulnerability to too much in fear.<p>As voters, we are too gullible, too easily led to see holes punched in our Constitution, to see over active big gumment, throwing away blood and treasure, stepping on individual citizens, etc.  I say this not as an anti-gumment libertarian but just as someone wanting to see better gumment from less 'overreach' -- the Swartz case, ""foreign entanglements"", ""foreign adventures"", etc.  I'd take the US Federal gumment back several decades and even there tell the over active state department to take a hike or take a rest.<p>But, there are people who want to get their hands on big power and, thus, rush to careers in big gumment.  The solution is for the voters to say ""No"".  Quite effective is just to cut their budgets.  For this solution, key is better information available to voters.  I suspect that a lot of the needed information is available but not promulgated by the MSM and their traditional 'journalistic' values.  I believe that the Internet can be the source of such information.  I hope my startup will help people do better finding what they want ('safe for work') on the Internet and, in particular, do better tracking their gumment, in the US and even outside.",1363966766

But one issue that I haven't seen anyone comment on is that race and sex are very overt traits, while family wealth and IQ are a good bit less obvious at a glance.<p>Being born in a poor family makes life much harder, no question, but (e.g.) if a straight white man from a trailer park does get into a good college then the people around him won't immediately guess his background (and judge him for it). A lot of them will make the high-probability assumption that his family is similar to their own, and that implicit sense of kinship will go a long way toward making him a welcome part of the community.<p>A person who's black or female in that same environment could hardly expect to have the same experience: those traits are in most cases obvious at a glance. If a teacher or a peer has a prejudice against both ""blacks"" and ""people from trailer parks"" (consciously or unconsciously), the black student will definitely suffer from it while the poor white student may luck out.

We are on the same page.</i>\nI just don't think we need a men's rights movement to further draw gendered lines across the social fabric. I'd rather see a federated organization that fights to improve humanity and its social institutions, obliterating inequalities and disparities. This, while making no claim (and vigilantly remaining blind) to sexual, gender, ethnic, or other material identities.<p>---<p>I, too, consider myself to be an egalitarian where the material conditions and social relations of people are at stake. I've made a number of attempts at clarifications, all the while making it explicitly clear that I'm supportive of and advocating for completely eliminating gender inequalities. I'm either doing a poor job of explaining that, or others are doing a poor job of reading my many clarifications.<p>To put it bluntly, there's no way I could respond to every men's rights comment with a clear and considered explanation of the positives and negatives, as well as an accounting of the pitfalls and errors made. The topic itself is tangential, distracting, and derailing from the issues raised by the event at Pycon, specifically in relation to how the offending men's actions are being erroneously and unfairly contextualized and framed as 'sexist' by the wider tech community.<p>I <i>did not</i> want to just sweep gender inequalities under the rug where male-identifying persons are concerned, as if it doesn't exist. I wanted to focus attention, instead, on the nuances of properly identifying sexism apart from inappropriate comments in a given situation, and the ways in which it leads to gender disparities in social relations in general.[1]<p>At first, I ignored the men's rights issues out of a desire to not deviate from the issues I raised, and interest in engaging with those who were replying to the points I brought up. I did not want to kick off a side-thread on men's rights. I wanted to avoid seeing the conversation turn into an us vs them argument. I hoped we could actually discuss the need to correct the reactionary labeling of impolite and inappropriate comments and behaviors as <i>automatically sexist</i>, when so many times it is simply impolite and inappropriate. Even at the worst end of the non-sexist spectrum, someone might deal with an asshole, and I think it's far more productive to the tech community and society at large if everyone could actually tell (and advocate) the difference between someone being an asshole and someone being a sexist asshole.<p>[I'm not saying my reaction was right; I'm trying to contextualize it within my personal quirks and goals so it's understood.]<p>By the time a couple hours passed, the men's rights derailment was already well underway, with quite a few reactionary posts following the first that were increasingly divisive, and substantially less constructive to the actual thread. More notably, the discussion consistently conveyed a less erudite, misinformed, and poorly rendered assessment and presentation of incredibly disconnected, questionable, exaggerated, and falsely attributed or incomplete evidence--all conflated to advance a flimsy premise that 'men have it as bad as (and often worse than) women'. Much of what was argued at the time I decided to comment (specifically the one to which you've responded) could not be taken seriously as presented.<p>So, I had choices. I could dig in, evaluate the evidence & reasoning presented, explain why much of it had to be disregarded as non-causal/incomplete/misattributed/exaggerated/etc., do the philosophically correct and helpful thing by improving their arguments for them so I wasn't just responding to the weakest, most hastily cobbled together rant ... or I could just not engage, and try to bring the focus back to where it should be. I could give in slightly and add some clarifications that would elucidate my intentions and meaning, while making it plain I was not interested in seeing the conversation devolve into a circular exchange of pointless <i>tu quoque</i>; indulging countless iterations of ""if a man did <i>x</i>, women would sell their mothers into slavery to claw his eyes out and publicly shame him""; 20 more comments brow-beating people about male-victimizing sexual assault endemic to the US's deplorable prison system; etc. Those are three of the choices I recall considering at the time.<p><i>Fundamentally</i>, my goal was to <i>protect the conversation</i> from becoming a cesspool of what was already starting to increase in vitriol and volume on Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and other endpoints--preserving and encouraging a space where the tech community, male/female/trans, could constructively grapple with a problem we need to make right for everyone so we don't keep fucking each other up every time we get in the same damn room (to enjoy and participate in the same damn event/hobby/pasttime/passion/etc., no less!).<p>[1]: <i>A sometimes less-helpful feature of my personality, made habit by philosophical study and debate, I maintain a very strong aversion to changing the subject, lest one damage one's own argument, lose one's audience, or make it impossible to logically conclude a line of thought.

I've shared it with a couple of people I'm close with in an attempt to help them understand what my life has been like for the past few years. I've been suffering from chronic pain for a little while now, mostly in pretty much every area of my back. I've been through the medial wringer, much like yourself... more doctor's visits (everything from osteopaths to rheumatologists to spinal surgeons, etc.), MRIs, and x-rays than I can count, usually without much luck. I've been on all sort of medications: anti-inflammatory, anti-seizure, opioid, biologic, etc. Nothing even made a dent. I've always worked on getting better, but only very recently did I decide to make it my #1 priority. Since then, I've probably read a dozen books on pain, some of them enlightening and some of them just pure garbage. That included everything from Dr. John Sarno to medical textbooks on the spine to hokey new age books that advocated crystal patches. When I started reading about trigger point therapy and postural recovery, everything clicked for me. Since then, I've been extremely vigilant in taking care of my own trigger points as well as making big strides in my sitting, standing, and walking posture... addressing structural issues. Since then, I've been able to reduce my pain from an average of 6 to a probably a 1-2. I've also reduced my medications to one Tramadol a day as well as some light supplementation (Magnesium). I've made such fantastic progress that I've considered changing my field to one where I can help people in similar situations. I understand you've come to embrace your pain, but it's never too late to cure yourself.",1363966019

One day, a patch went out to the public side which had a bunch of internal codenames and other stuff you normally wouldn't share with the outside world.  So, the people working on the project went into SVN and manually chopped it out.<p>I started wondering what else might have been in there and went grepping for things which resembled our fairly distinctive host naming scheme.  A simple regex did the trick, and while I didn't find any evidence of ""prod secrets"" leaking into the world, I did find something very strange in the argv parser which happened to match.<p>There was a comparison of argv to a string which looked like base64 to me.  I decoded it and it turned out to be ""--WHAT"" (I think, it's been a few years).  Actually running ""the_tool --WHAT"" made it print an enormous ASCII pimp on the screen with some kind of saying underneath.

Spiders index whatever other websites link to. The URLs may have been trivial but if there were no public links to them then a spider wouldn't have followed them. And then on the other hand they <i>would</i> be on another website if anyone (like weev) had linked to them, which you can do just as easily with a link that will cause a buffer overrun, and the spider will then follow it and overrun the buffer. It's completely plausible for a search engine to provide you with a search hit which if you click on it will cause a buffer overflow on the destination server and give you root access to the machine, because some ""hacker"" posted such a link on their site and the search engine indexed it and put it in the database.<p>>That's not a valid test. If a company decides they didn't want you to see something <i>after the fact</i> (as in this case) they can always just claim they didn't configured their servers how they meant to.<p>That's what I'm saying. <i>All</i> prosecutions for ""unauthorized access"" are like that, because if the server had been configured properly then unauthorized access would be impossible, so when it's discovered that it was misconfigured after the fact, the server operator wants to go back and retroactively label the conduct as unauthorized even though their computer allowed it.<p>There is certainly a matter of degree as to how far you had to go out of your way to get the server to do something you want it to do, but that is such a hopelessly vague and meaningless line between legal and illegal actions that (as Prof. Kerr has argued) it's potentially unconstitutional, to say nothing of whether it makes for good policy.<p>>What blaming the victim? The victims were the people who's data got released.<p>Again, that's the point. The law is stupid. The culpable party here is AT&T for putting its customers' info at risk. The party being imprisoned is the one who publicized the vulnerability rather than the ones responsible for putting it into production. I don't know if I support actual criminal penalties just for operating a vulnerable server, but I certainly take issue with the idea that if you do that and then someone publicizes your incompetence, you should have the right to put them in prison for it based on some vague notion of having gone too far in proving the point.",1363965718

Let's talk about hardware engineering. Male connectors? (those are connectors with sticky-outy-pins) Female connectors? (those are the ones that are receptacles for sticky-outy-pins) Genderbenders? (those are adapters you use to make one gender connector into a different one) You ""mate"" those connectors, of course. You might screw them. If you work in the underwater world like I do, you might have penetrators. Now you get to mate penetrators! lol! Sometimes if you don't have something mated to the penetrator you have to hack a way to make it waterproof just for a quick test so, guess what you put on the penetrator? A condom! (I am not joking, I have put a lot of condoms onto penetrators in my time, they are excellent quick cheap waterproofers) Also, did you know that in Australia, the world ""flange"" is slang for a woman's genitalia? Guess how excited I was when I found out I (female) had given 30 minutes of training to a bunch of Australian military men including discussion of mating the flanges on our equipment to put some things together?<p>> The tech world is full of ""hilariously"" sex-related terminology. When you first learn about it, you get a Beavis and Butthead heh-heh-heh phase to go through. Then you stop thinking of it as pervy and you forget it has a meaning outside of the work you do until someone has their Beavis and Butthead moment and giggles at you, usually in the middle of something you're trying to be smart and professional about. Most of the terminology I think was dreamed up by people (mostly men, because that's who was in the industry) who thought it was hilarious and now that there are women in the industry it's even MORE hilarious that they have to learn and use those terms regularly.<p>> I'm a woman in engineering. I'm one of the ""cool"" girls. I swear and I laugh at dumb inappropriate jokes and i proudly wear our (old, from startup phase) company shirts that say ""when size matters"" showing the different sizes of our phallic-shaped equipment. But I swear and I laugh and I wear that shirt in the small group of friendly coworkers with whom I am very socially comfortable. When I get the Beavis and Butthead chuckles from those I am not friendly with, it is tiring as all fuck. I don't care about the etymology of the word. I don't care how well-known the word is in the industry jargon. I don't care. What I care about is when I am using the professionally-accepted jargon, someone is giggling at me going ""heh heh you know what that sounds like you're saying"" because it is immature, distracting, and undermining to me when that's what people are paying attention to when I speak.<p>> No one invented ""Fork me on GitHub"" to be pure and virginal about it.

A system which rewards production over anything is a system in which those who can't produce as effectively will be punished. Unless you truly believe that production is the end-all be-all of human existence, that's not a fair system. (There's also the problem of capitalism being really bad at properly valuing things but that's neither here nor there.)<p>But what you're missing, Mr. Jiggy, is that the biases we're talking about extend way beyond ""industry"". They infiltrate every part of our culture. Politics, media representation, religious attitudes, the values we teach our children, on and on and on.<p>This incident with Adria is happening the same week that a number of news organizations were criticized for reporting on a rape trial and <i>sympathizing with the rapists.</i> CNN, NPR, Fox News all ran stories about how much it sucks to have your life ruined for raping somebody. Some even disclosed the name of the 16-year-old victim, so that people could email her rape threats the same way they've been writing Adria. And this wasn't an ambiguous case of ""did they rape this girl""  the people shot video of the rape and posted it to YouTube with the tags ""rape"" and ""offensive"". Still we had people asking if the raped girl ""was asking for it"", and writing hatefully that she's just a ""slut who ruined two good boys' lives"".<p>I get that you feel there are other imbalances at play in society, and believe you me there are! But please don't make this about which particular imbalance is the outright worst one. Ours is a hugely misogynistic culture, and this unfortunate incident is triggering not only a huge bout of anti-feminist sentiment, but also convincing a lot of people that feminists are just assholes who need attention at the expense of innocent men. Which is about the opposite of true.<p>Again, if you want to start a thread to discuss other flaws in the system, be my guest!

5423338,comment,5419071,5420275,3,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Yeah, it's a kind of ad hominem, because it says, ""This person's arguments are not worth listening to because this person's behavior is not in line with what they are arguing for."" But if arguments are rational things with inherent truth then it doesn't matter who says them.<p>The inconsistency claimed here was an argument against the credibility of the claimed offense. ""Offense"" is not a objective conclusion of a rational argument, it is a subjective state. Inconsistency in the part of the person claiming the subjective response is a legitimate basis for challenging the claim of offense, and isn't a form of ad hominem fallacy because it isn't challenging the <i>argument</i> being made because of the hypocrisy of the arguer, it is challenging the <i>fact claim in the premise</i> of the argument, by presenting factual evidence.",1363964678

I will take the Air over the Surface any day of the week. With the Air I get: better keyboard, better battery life, snappier response, better screen, more storage, more RAM, and for some reason the Surface is &quot;unbalanced&quot; and feels like a brick when you pick it up. The Surface is less convenient to use, you cannot prop it up on your lap, you cannot prop it up on your stomach and lay in bed.

6155173,comment,6152857,6154912,2,0,waps,,,"Exactly. There is no protection to the title of books. The reason the author can force to change the title is the same reason you can be &quot;forced&quot; to sign an EULA. If you want to use the story, that is illegal until the writer contractually gives you that right. He can put whatever terms in that contract and you can say yes or no.<p>So an author can force a film company to switch all it&#x27;s employees to rainbow colored forks in their family homes and the film company has two options : comply, or find another book to make a movie from.<p>This is similar to an EULA. You are in no way forced to sign the EULA. But there&#x27;s nothing else giving you the right to use the software. So you have one of two choices : agree to the EULA, or find another piece of software.",1375610055

Immunity from war crimes seems such a weird concept. I think it is the flip side of aggressively prosecuting whistleblowers, it sends a signal to the rest of the people in the employ of the government. &#x27;Even if you do this, we&#x27;ll protect you&#x27; and &#x27;If you do this, we&#x27;ll hound you forever&#x27;. It would be quite refreshing to see a nation-state prosecute its military and contractors (mercenaries, really) suspected of war crimes with the same zeal with which they target whistle-blowers.<p>Regarding the charges relating to computer fraud: This is like wire fraud. It&#x27;s apparently pretty hard to do anything illegal in the USA without getting a charge of mail / wire fraud attached to it. I figure anything that involves a computer and that displeases someone in an official position is grounds for a computer fraud case. So I think the writers assertion that mailing the same documents in paper form would have had a different effect is wrong. The only thing that I think would change is that computer fraud would be replaced by mail fraud.<p>Manning is being charged with all this mostly because he embarrassed the US administration, not because of any fraud or real life fall out (contrary to earlier claims of lives put at risk and deaths related to the leaks no specific death has been positively linked to the leaks and any such claims were retracted during the case). The Image of the USA has been damaged, the recent NSA leaks damage it further. Instead of asking itself how to remedy the root causes an example is made out of those that stood up. Business as usual, unfortunately.",1375609523

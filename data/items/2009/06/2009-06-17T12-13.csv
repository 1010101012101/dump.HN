The proof is often given as a problem in your basic automata class.  ""Regexes"" are no longer the same as ""Regular Expressions"" in automata theory.  But their origin is in automata theory.  A lot of the ""ew, regexes"" reaction comes from this.<p>I'm skeptical that augmented ""regexes"" are any more maintainable than compiler compilers.",1245243368

And they want in on that.  They want to invest their money there because it seems more assured.<p>If you haven't shown any past success, then you're a risk.  What makes you more likely to succeed than any random person?<p>This is why I like to have a few nice, running web apps of my own.  When applying for jobs, they show that I've ""succeeded"" on my own (beyond what I might have contributed to on a team at my previous jobs).  Sure, there are probably many people much smarter than me who don't have such apps to show off.  However, my past ""success"" (at writing code and bringing it to production) is there.<p>The problem with the $15,000 songwriter that the article mentions is that they were a risk when first signed and so they only got a little.  Even as they've proven themselves not to be a risk with their weekly submissions, they already accepted the bad terms and there's little reason for the record company to be ""nice"" and give them more.  Likewise, if the $500,000 advance person is terrible, the record company has agreed to certain terms and there's no reason for them to be ""nice"" and renegotiate down because they're crap.<p>The largest part of this is that if something looks like it will succeed with or without help, it seems like a sure thing.  Sure things don't require the rewards of high risk things because the chance of loss is low.",1245242340

This really hurts email list usefulness until and unless the users improve their habits.<p>Unfortunately...<p>a) Outlook use is usually required by The Corporate Overlords.  Even if it isn't required, users that don't know better insist on using it because it allows them to paste Mbyte .BMP screen shots into it. :-(<p>b) While Outlook can be configured for usable quoting, nobody bothers to do so.<p>c) Even if configured in the best way it supports, Outlook is still suboptimal.<p>d) Web based email interfaces are generally even less configurable than Outlook and they all aspire to mimic Outlook, including promoting all of the crappy habits.<p>---<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million, nine hundred and seventy-three thousand, five hundred and nine pages, says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation products that ""it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all."" In other words, - and this is the rock-solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation's Galaxywide success is founded - their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws.<p>-- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy / Douglas Adams (1952 - 2001). 1st American ed.

In fact this story wouldn't have been a story, definitely not on the top page of hacker news, if it was just about another man that is a technical lead.  I think the point of stories like these are to attempt to inspire the women who are already in our industry and I definitely see no issues with that.  It's sad that some think we can't discuss the fact that she is a woman and that she probably had to overcome more than just being a great programmer to get to her position.  No doubt her technical skill is amazing, but for her to rise to the top in a male dominated field is equally amazing!",1245241188
661697,comment,661168,661288,0,0,Retric,,,"The problem with stereotypes being excluded is you also tend to exclude people outside that stereotype who think that way.  The Sims is a great game for the ""Girl"" demographic ""Barby Dress up"" not so much.  The problem with ""Barby Dress up"" style games is you can't do the play acting that most girls do when playing with dolls.  It completely misses the point for people of both genders who play with dolls and or action figures.<p>The Sims on the other hand let's people roll play real life while expanding on the core idea to make it even more fun.<p>PS: Growing up my little sister liked, Pet's, and Roller Coaster Tycoon, and some RPG's.

The advice is extremely banal bordering on common sense but most importantly discounts the fact that a lot of startups are built not to solve any existing problem but perhaps to just better an existing solution.<p>The semantics are crucial here, because solving a problem almost implies that it is something a customer 'understands' to be a problem and not just satisfed with the status quo - that is true for almost everything - give me a better house, car, laptop, email, search etc. etc. anyday and if its really good enough I will switch.<p>The biggest startups were not found by scratching an 'itch' but through founders idiosyncratic views of the status quo and how they belived (without an MBA, without a customer survey and without figuring out if it was really an 'itch') on what was a better way, and for a long time without any external validation.<p>Selling books online - how does that even make sense, the internet was supposed to get rid of books but Amazon found a way.

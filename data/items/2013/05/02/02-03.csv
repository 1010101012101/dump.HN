I support ATM client software for a large bank in the US and we certainly don't do this. This may be true for ""remote"" ATMs that are installed in convenience stores on POTS. I can't say I've ever actually heard of it though - the main problem with this idea is that cards cannot be authenticated without network access, and just spewing out money to every piece of plastic calling itself a card when your network connection has been dropped isn't really a recipe for success. Fraud is a real problem.<p>The ATM client software I support cannot do any transactions without a connection with its authorization system. That authorization system though, can stand-in for the various accounting systems and external networks up to pre-defined limits. So for example if for some reason we can't reach the checking account system we'll authorize up to $xxx total for the day on a stand-in basis. The transaction with the authorization system is definitely ACID; the ATM will not get a response code authorizing a withdrawal unless the transaction has been recorded in the authorization system. The account system may well be caught up later. The funny thing is, ACID is a property of individual database systems and it has absolutely nothing to with a question of whether two separate ledgers are guaranteed to be changed together or not at all. That would be the job of a distributed transaction coordinator - and those really are not used very much in banking. Instead there is a protocol of credits and debits and a settlement process to work out the exceptions. Maybe this is what the article was trying to say up to a point but they sort of confused the issue between the point of view of the ATM and the accounting systems of record.",1367463494

The western world didn't come from nowhere. People built it, and their successors should be able to reap the fruits of it, not have to flee to the developing world.<p>I read an article the other day (it was in Forbes or maybe Business Week). Some American was talking about the investment opportunities in China, and the cultural differences between the countries. He came to free speech, and he basically said: ""in the U.S. we can say whatever we want, but in China they think that's silly!"" I.e. apologizing for the repressive Chinese communist government just because there is a buck to be made there now.

So you still end up getting a lot of popups getting through the blocker.<p>My proposal is to eliminate distinction between the categories, and just block all popups.

The integration tests are therefore the most important, since those are what will expose the bad assumptions.<p>I wrote a program that used the computer&#x27;s MAC address. The API that reports the MAC strips leading 0s, but my MAC had no leading 0s and so I I did not notice this behavior during development. If I had just captured and replayed this result, my tests would have passed on all machines, even affected ones. But because my tests exercised the real API, I encountered the bug and was able to work around it.",1427691552

That&#x27;s not really &quot;the number of births in the United States 1957 to 2007.&quot; But let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s fine. Then they ask, &quot;During which period(s) was there a decline in the number of births?&quot; There is no such thing as &quot;a decline in the number of births.&quot; The number of births always increases. There can be a decline in the rate of births per time, e.g., the number of births per year. But giving the number of births per year every ten years is not enough information to make a complete statement about births per time during the ten year periods. There may have been (and probably were) declines during each of those periods. In other words, it is impossible to &quot;click all that apply.&quot;",1427691504

I obviously get to retain value from the experience and what I learned. There is a significant toll that is paid with every serious start-up, measured in years of your life, effort, stress, difficult life trade-offs, and a love for what you do and having to deal with that not working out. All I&#x27;ve ever wanted to do is build, and work with great people; it always sucks to not come through for people you look up to, that believed in you.

You need to write mocks for services you depend on, ideally by recording and replaying real api interactions, such that you can verify that given the libraries you depend on your tests will be correct. Then write TDD tests, then write code, then write integ tests which will verify your original mocks work as assumed.",1427688614
9287607,comment,9277572,9283107,0,0,kibwen,,,"Rust does eat its own dogfood with regard to macros, and over time has steadily replaced former language-level features like `log` and `panic` with macros. Syntactic distinction is a philosophical choice in service of making costs more explicit (and while it&#x27;s true that functions can hide behavior, overuse of macros can trigger enormous code bloat, such as the `regex!` macro which compiles your regex into a state machine).<p>(There are also valid technical reasons for requiring syntactic distinction, as the sheer flexibility of Rust&#x27;s macros in their ability to create new syntax run the risk of making it a nightmare to parse if you remove the unambiguous ability of the compiler to drop into macro-parsing mode. These challenges aren&#x27;t insurmountable, just very hairy.)",1427688575

9287605,comment,9286563,9287528,0,0,akkartik,,,"Ah, such a simple word, but such complexity hidden under its hood. Regulation can create rentier institutions like the taxi medallion system[1] alongside PG&E. So another way to phrase my question is: how can we distinguish regulations that result in PG&E from those that result in taxis? When do the benefits of regulating an established player outweigh the costs in reduced incentives for others to attempt to create future monopolies?<p>One potential resolution to the question is that you can&#x27;t, that PG&E&#x27;s failure to grow is just a temporary failure of imagination. Rentierism is a weed that, uh, finds a way, to quote Jeff Goldblum from Jurassic Park (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkWeMvrNiOM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkWeMvrNiOM</a>). Under this worldview, a utility is merely a monopoly that nobody wants to compete with anymore -- for now. It has temporarily exhausted its growth/optimization curve, leading to predictable revenues. For a while the predictable revenues are divided between existing players (shareholders, govt, employees, etc.) in a stable equilibrium. But eventually, institutions that fail to grow (taxis) will run into hacks that do (Uber/Lyft).<p>An alternative solution would be that there <i>is</i> a distinction between good and bad regulations, perhaps that you have to weigh the size of the regulator against the size of the regulated industry. Taxi regulations were bad because they were suppressing a small industry. Regulation of large industries on the other hand, is more likely to do good than harm. Provided public attention can outlast private lobbying. That tension then becomes the new frontier for the eternal battle of public policy.<p>[1] More examples here: <a href=""http://www.cloverfoodlab.com/blog/2008/09/05/licensing-and-other-city-services-to-date;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloverfoodlab.com/blog/2008/09/05/licensing-and-o...</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_Raj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_Raj</a>",1427688535

That&#x27;s a major part of where my speculation came from that many (or at least some) at USDS are being onboard as contractors because that&#x27;s pretty much how consulting works classically. While that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone works that way, it does seem contrary to the evidence that USDS is supposed to be exclusively (presumably, retained, FTE-ish, salaried) feds.<p>Regardless, I greatly welcome change to the federal service system in any way to promote better retention and progress for its tech workers. Federal service used to mean good and service a source of genuine pride.

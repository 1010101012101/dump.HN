Also, most apartment managers wait the full 3 weeks to return your deposit in CA.<p>3.)

Go to Cafe Artigiano or JJ Bean for great coffee. Too many great places to eat but I'll mention Guu (<a href=""http://www.guu-izakaya.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guu-izakaya.com/</a>) and Hapa Izakaya (<a href=""http://www.hapaizakaya.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hapaizakaya.com/</a>).",1212647215

I've used SE 610, SE T637, SE K750, SE K790, Samsung D900, Nokia 6300. All of these phones are were well above average in capabilities (J2ME and otherwise) at the time I purchased them. But, the vast majority of the J2ME applications I tried to download were unusable for a variety of reasons.",1212646850
209709,comment,209412,209691,0,0,ible,,,"We should be skeptical that any particular metric does what it claims to do, especially ones which are ad-hoc or based on intuition instead of evidence. I'm not suggesting that Gladwell is wrong about any of the examples he gave being 'mismatches', or that there are many of them, and exposing the misuse of metrics is certainly valuable. However, he seems to go further, suggesting that we can't find good predictors at all, which is a claim which I think deserves just as much skepticism. I doubt he would seriously make such a claim, and it is probably just an artifact of an early talk which won't be present in his book, but I have plenty of skepticism to go around, so I'm perfectly happy to deploy it wherever it is warranted at all.",1212646688
209708,comment,209433,209433,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Sorry, but most MMORPGs are just like resort casinos.  There's a glitzy surface with great art-direction, but it's really not much deeper than a stage set.  It's just a pretty background to distract you while you're subverted using variable schedules of reward in a Skinner box.  Variable Schedules of Reward are inherently addicting.  You can get a rat in a Skinner Box to expend so much effort pulling a lever for a food-pellet reward, that it starves to death because the energy it takes to pull the lever exceeds the amount it gets in food pellets.  This is exactly what happens to people who play slots and other games in casinos, and what happens to you when you start ""farming"" for experience points or gold.  Invariably you seek out places where you get the rare but extremely valuable ""drop.""<p>I'm sorry, but using this power of addiction to try to solve social ills could result in more evils.  The fact thats this isn't addressed directly in this talk concerns me.<p>In any case, I know how to create an online world that doesn't insult the intelligence of smart people.  I know how to create an online world that isn't just a stage-set background for a skinner-box addiction, because it has real depth through emergent complexity.<p>(In all fairness, the speaker emphasizes the motivational power of social aspects of online gaming.  But collaboration is a capability granted by the network, not by MMO games in particular.)",1212646346

There's plenty of vacuous stuff going on, but it's only part of the overall scene.  LA is incredibly diverse.<p>There's a reason millions of people live here and the real estate is retardedly expensive.  It's effing awesome.<p>(Especially for someone who's clearly as open to new experiences as you are; I think you'll love it if you find the right scene)",1212646231

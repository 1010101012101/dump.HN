482029,comment,481868,482018,0,0,Bjoern,,,"Please don't misunderstand or compare Debian with Ubuntu. (at least I have the feeling that people do this nowadays because Ubuntu is so popular).<p>They have different release strategies, Debian focuses on stability and security as a Server orientated distribution. Ubuntu on the other hand has a strong commitment twoards the user desktop segment. Both is fine, I mean Ubuntu is basically just Debian with faster release cycles (and they like to taint their Kernel). (sorry for the oversimplification)<p>If you prefer more uptodate Software from the Debian side, please try testing, unstable and experimental. For the totally impatient there is e.g. Backports, Sidux and many more. Cross-pinning (mixing of Debian and Ubuntu is possible too.) Don't know how far Ubutnutu (or how ever you write that project name) has come.",1234713423

Apple serves that market fine, perhaps even better than Windows does.<p>But if you are a programmer, OS X and Windows are not good choices unless you are writing OS X or Windows apps (or you've watched too many Ruby on Rails screencasts).",1234713183
482026,comment,481498,481842,0,0,jrockway,,,"> It's an old adage that design isn't how something looks, it's how it works. Macbooks have far more elegant functionality.<p>How?  When I want to plug a USB device into my Thinkpad, I put the USB device near a USB port and apply pressure to the device.  When performing this operation with a Mac, the sequence of events is the same.  (I could go on, but won't.)<p>There is just no difference.<p>> I don't look at it that way: I look at built-in experience. I think that customization is a waste of time.<p>No offense, but I think your mind will be changed after you are out of college and need to do $MAXIMAL_TASKS in $MINIMAL_TIME.  A day spent customizing something pays for itself very quickly in increased productivity.  If you have plenty of free time, you might not care, but if you have more to do than there are hours in a day, you will want to save as much time as possible.<p>I don't have time for the computer to tell me what to do.  (But I do have time to write HN comments... hmm...)",1234713018

Turning these people into heroes is counterproductive: for every founder that is actually able to get something out of their 110-hour workweek, there are 100 who only make their lives miserable and accomplish nothing trying to emulate the masters.<p>There is no way any halfway sane person is able to work 110 hours a week on a ""sustained basis"". Your physical and mental health will start to suffer after a pretty short time. Genius comes with insanity, not the other way around. There are a few crazy, brilliant people out there, but you will know beforehand if you are one of them. Ripping out piercings on stage will not turn you into Marilyn Manson, breaking all the sexual conventions will not turn you into Oscar Wilde and leaving only 8 hours a day for life-supporting routines will not turn you into Len Bosack.<p>Normal people should play by the normal rules. You're only wasting your life if you keep telling yourself that you have to be hard, cold and miserable in order to succeed. The crazy geniuses in this category don't read Hacker News.",1234710462

482001,comment,481444,481944,0,0,hailxenu,,,"Disclaimer: engineering undergrad here, half-learnt book knowledge lies ahead.<p>All of this discussion boils down to how you define the word 'enterprise'. A definition I was taught, of the concept of 'empresa' (meaning, literally in Spanish, 'enterprise'), is<p><i>socio-economical unit in which capital, work and direction are coordinated to achieve production that responds to the requirements of the human medium in which it acts</i>,<p>which is indeed a broad definition, and one that accepts Microsoft, Apple, the Wikimedia Foundation and your local soup kitchen as enterprises, even if not all are for-profit organizations.<p>Now, sustainability is desirable trait all such organizations, but it is not required, obviously ;)<p>You say that making a definition as general as that to be useless, but I disagree. When someone tells you that he is an entrepreneur, and nothing else, all you know is that he runs an organization that does _something_ for _someone_. You don't know anything about his profits, whether he seeks them or not, and that is something that, for an outsider, doesn't matter. The definition of 'entrepreneur', profit seeking or not, does not help you to know about the finances of the organization, and thus the generality isn't harmful to it.",1234710086

In fact, your position is so advantageous that it might be worthwhile to see if you can leverage them against one another to get some perks. I have no clue whether or not this kind of negotiation would work, given how competitive each of these schools is, but it might be worth a shot.",1396396776
7512651,comment,7512494,7512494,3,0,azinman2,,,"My background: undergrad at UCSD, phd at MIT. Also taken courses at community college, san francisco state, private SF-based k-8, public high school (in marin county). I feel like I&#x27;ve sampled a wide range of US-types of education.<p>I&#x27;d consider if you have any idea whatsoever if you want to go to grad school or not. You&#x27;d be a fool to think you&#x27;d know now, but if you can project out a bit it helps.<p>If you want to go to grad school, that will end up mattering more because it&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll specialize. Undergrad is more for opening up your mind and creating early-stage networks. You&#x27;ll get amazing networks at all 3 of those and ultimately can&#x27;t fail. But the cultures are very different at each place, and I say that knowing 2/3 of those cultures very well.<p>Go to Harvard if you want to be a non-technical CEO. It won&#x27;t be super rigorous (redonk grade inflation) but the surrounding egos will elevate yours and give you the confidence to do whatever you want (justified or not). That&#x27;s something I saw in the transition from UCSD to MIT -- your peers will push you. There&#x27;s also lots of good people running around, and your network will be super strong.<p>Go to Stanford if you want to be a technical CEO. You should probably leave the bay area for a bit, but you can also do that after college. It&#x27;s not like Cambridge, MA is that crazy different in the same way that living outside the US would be, so don&#x27;t think that level of geographic movement is so significant from years 18-22. Go study abroad your junior year for that (which I _highly_ recommend).<p>Go to MIT if you&#x27;re more interested in being technical than CEO, but it&#x27;s still possible. MIT culture values raw technical talent more than the other three (IMHO), and is very &#x27;purist&#x27; in that respect. But people will be the most autistic compared to the other two, so if you want to learn to be a &quot;normal&quot; person go elsewhere. That said I loved MIT, and it was an amazing place to do a phd. It&#x27;s full of super super smart people, and then normal smart people. Not many actually dumb people (all 3 will have that in different proportions), just many non-creative people.",1396396773

Gandi refused to respond to their web form for a period of about four weeks or more; they let my domain expire and be deleted (if I recall, the only problem was that my credit card expiration date needed to be updated in their system and the charge processed).  Besides the immediate hassle and serious annoyance of having an uncontactable company ignore their support form, it ended up costing me a few hundred dollars to buy the domain back from a domain speculator who snatched it up.<p>What price should I put on that?  What price is it worth to Gandi?  Are they going to offer me a year&#x27;s free domain registration with them?

Before Spotify swept up just about every single artist ever known to man, VK was the place to find recordings of even that obscure 80s band you saw down the New Cross tavern on a Tuesday night with seven other people and a dog. Better selection than Oink in its heyday. And if you&#x27;re Russian, there&#x27;s no reason to ever go anywhere else for film or television.",1396393558

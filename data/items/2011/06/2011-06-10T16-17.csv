2641546,comment,2640727,2640727,1,0,tct,,,"Microsoft have released some great products in the last few years; Xbox and Windows Phone are a couple.  Xbox has obviously done extremely well and WP is only going to grow with their partnership with Nokia.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but these were both the result of starting from scratch with a smaller, more agile team who have permission to do something different and new.  This works; even for Microsoft.<p>I also feel that maybe similar to Marco Arment's comments on the benefits of the new features in iOS on Instapaper, this may be the case for MSFT.  If Apple can pave the way to making consumers' understand or at least appreciate what the cloud can do for them, then Microsoft and Google and others will have an easier time talking about their products.  Before the iPhone came out, people couldn't see why and didn't want a ""smartphone"".  Now everyone wants one, whether it's an iPhone or Android (and in the next few years Microsoft).<p>Microsoft does have some great products in this sphere I believe, Mesh and Skydrive being two.  I haven't used either, but from what I've heard they do have some great potential.  If off the back of Apple's announcement they can make them look good and continue developing on them, they will be able to sell it, even if its just by saying its the same as iCloud, but made by us.  Apple does have a reputation of creating beautiful, easy to use products, but they are also seen as expensive and sometimes unneccessary.  Android has taken off by being an alternative - Microsoft have the potential to be that alternative to iCloud.  They have the pieces and experience shows MSFT does much better when they are the underdogs (Xbox and WP).<p>Just my two cents.",1307725184

Execution, not so much.",,"Two years ago, I created a balloon distribution business that was earning me upwards of $300 per day every day, but last November, I got into a terrible accident that has disabled me temporarily and I have not been able to do the work. I tried outsourcing and franchising but that was simply not working out.<p>Being bed-ridden, I had my laptop and the Internet to keep me from losing my sanity. So I began thinking of business ideas that I could do from my computer to help me earn some money and keep me busy.<p>Coming up with the ideas was easy and soon I had a list that included:<p>- Buying and selling items on Craigslist
- Opening up an online bookstore
- Starting a ""Lunch Time Specials"" website
- Teaching<p>And finally,<p>- Writing an eBook about my balloon business and selling it on the Internet.<p>Now, under normal circumstances, I would have never thought about selling an idea that was making me so much money but the situation I was in was anything but normal.<p>So I decided to write an 18 page report detailing everything I knew about the balloon distribution business. I had someone setup a nice website that was linked to my paypal account and I placed ads on Google, Yahoo, and Facebook to attract customers. I spent $100 to advertise on each site and after my $300 was used up, I had received only 11 orders. Not only that but Google suspended my account for violating their terms of service.<p>Since then, I have tried various free marketing methods and done much better than paid advertisement but I feel like the amount of time I spend marketing the business simply does not justify the returns.<p>So I guess the point I am trying to make is that even a six figure a year idea is worthless if you cannot execute it properly.<p>Thanks

Corporate IT shops, especially within certain industries, can be exceptionally wary of anything that moves data outside their walls. Consumers are in general not nearly so picky.  Corporations are MS's biggest customers and for years have had considerable influence on product direction. It's just not in Microsoft's DNA to ruffle the corporate customer feathers too much (whereas I get the sense Google and Apple almost take pleasure in it).<p>The biggest issue for MS isn't just that iCloud might be an embarrassment. It's a full on attack on the Windows monopoly. Apple telegraphed this in the WWDC presentation when they showed the stats on the numbers of people who don't own a personal computer (either Mac or Windows) in different countries around the world.

This sums it up: ""I do wordpress web dev and it is annoying to setup so many sites over and over.

WordPress was just an example, because it's free.  I made a mistake with my choice in post title and perhaps missed out on some opportunity because of that.<p>As for WordPress, some people are manually installing it, which is why there is a manual install option on the WordPress site, and it's a pain.  Also, companies specialize in installing WordPress bundled with themes and plugins, which SetupBOT can handle, and they are telling us that it is a pain for them too.<p>Thank you to the community for helping us connect with companies in that market.

Europeans on the other hand have been comfortable with labeling various national characteristics for centuries -- various national characteristics that are undoubtedly true. These come in negative, positive, and contested categories. For instance, the British are known for their ""stiff upper lip,"" Germans (traditionally, not contemporarily) for their warlike sentiment, etc.<p>In America we have the sense that these things are mutable, and this is partially true, but it is unreasonable to expect people to change overnight, and it is especially unreasonable to expect that some external force (e.g. purely economic forces) will produce the massive changes that might be perceived as necessary for a society to adapt to modernity as the Economist writers perceive as necessary and laudable.<p>In any case, I think it is unacceptable to focus only on the negative aspects of a people. ""Blacks are, well, blacks"" would generally be racist since virtually no one would use that in a positive sense. Italians often self-perceive that their resistance to the way things are done in a capitalist world is based on some inner nobility -- and although I generally disagree, I think there is still a grain of truth there. Besides, Italians are among the most openly racist peoples in Europe -- people from Northern Italy are even comfortable calling Southern Italy part of Africa (not meant in a positive sense!).",1307723937

You cannot market a feature that does not exist, nor can your brand gain a reputation for an attribute that your products do not have. But underneath, product, brand, and marketing all stem from vision and priorities. Apple and MS shared the same vision, but Apple made this part of that vision a priority. Therefore their products reflect it, their brand gains a reputation for it, and their marketing can highlight the features that support the vision. Microsoft made this part of their vision a talking point, thus their products don't reflect it, their brand lacks the reputation, and any marketing that tries to highlight connectedness of devices rings hollow.",1307722952

2641397,comment,2640727,2641360,3,0,DanI-S,,,"I'd argue that, through failure to gain consumer traction, Microsoft just haven't been able to create the network of tightly related devices that Apple has. Thanks to their consumer focus, Apple have an entire platform sharing the same operating system, individual devices developed somewhat in harmony. Microsoft, attempting to corner several markets separately, has competing teams working on entirely unrelated products whose connectedness is incidental.<p>There was a Steve Jobs keynote from the 1990s posted the other day in which he outlined his vision of a networked device ecosystem. It is very significant that they built the line of devices before they tried to market the backbone. Microsoft was thinking about this concept for just as long, but they never really had the platform.<p>Edit: To reply, the key is that product follows from brand and marketing. The reason Apple's products are connected so well is that they're all targeted at one market. Microsoft target several, so their products are developed in bubbles.<p>Edit: To reply again, I think we may be arguing the same thing, but our disagreement is in the reasoning. I believe that Microsoft's lack of a coherent product is due to an attempt to sell their vision to several markets at once; it makes connecting the dots very difficult. Apple's (assumed) success lies in their coherent targeting of a single market, through their strong consumer brand. Both of them are selling a vision; Apple get to amplify this by designing products that fit with their brand.<p>It's a shame we can't continue this conversation further due to the weird commenting system.",1307722774

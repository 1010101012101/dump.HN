2081092,comment,2078361,2080299,0,0,psaintla,,,"I once worked for a company that hired the way Facebook does and it is a recipe for disaster in the long term.  Two things brought an end to the practice but it was too little too late:<p>1.)  Employees were agreeing to hire people who weren't as skilled as they are because they were afraid of newer and younger competition.  As each generation of new hires were brought in they were successively worse than the previous.  The most senior employees saw the degradation of overall talent level and eventually left for greener pastures.  The company slowly ended up becoming composed of people who were barely qualified for their positions and several years after I had left they were bought out for pennies.<p>2.) They were sued for discrimination, it was a ridiculous accusation, but the company had to settle.  The reason was that without consciously trying we had all hired people who were of similar backgrounds to ourselves in many regards.  Apparently ""One of our team members wasn't sure about her"" doesn't cut it in court.",1294433691

The garbage men who take the trash off my curb provide more value than a lot of white collar management, in my opinion. If you're either intelligent and skillful, you'll certainly have a better chance of identifying a desirable economic niche to fill and being able to work your way towards it. But is it right that many of the hardest working people in society, doing undesirable jobs, are compensated so much less than ""knowledge workers""? Do you really think an 8 hour day sitting at a desk deserves twice as much pay as an 8 hour day digging a ditch? What the fuck is value? The compensation of a ditch digger has more to do with what a ditch digger can be offered to sustain himself than with any intrinsic 'value' of his work. That's true of a lot of shitty jobs, and it's bullshit that the people who have figured out how to exploit these shitty jobs to generate 'value' also somehow deserve respect, while the exploited are denigrated for their moral failures (such as laziness).",1294432965

But if you are doubting things like clockwork, then the safety valve has come to dominate the rest of the system, so to speak.this can become quite burdensome, especially when many entrepreneurs or innovators are untroubled by such considerations. Self-doubt of this kind can inhibit creativity, either due to repetitive fatigue or loss of motivation midway through a project. But by adjusting your perspective, you can make it work in your favor instead of feeling frustrated or depressed. Cultivating patience plays a key role in this.<p>Helpful tips I have picked up include: rationing your enthusiasm at the early stage so as to avoid regret over sunk costs; treating your loss of interest as a <i>solvable</i> problem with your business model rather than inherent unworthiness; keeping notes and revisiting older ideas regularly; completing small projects (very important, both for motivation and because every big project can be decomposed into smaller ones); giving away simple ideas - sharing creates virtuous circles and builds your social capital; and generally, developing your emotional intelligence.<p>Your ideas are aspects of yourself, and hesitancy about developing them is often rooted in memories of prior disappointment which you (understandably) have no desire to repeat: losing your enthusiasm is painful, but less so than having it crushed unexpectedly by someone else. 'Rejection therapy' is one way of getting over this - seek out or accept small rejections, and build up a thicker hide. Sharing some of what you can't use is a viable alternative strategy for those who dislike rejection, and if you feel a possessive twinge about some undeveloped idea, then maybe that's because it <i>does</i> have more potential than you were willing to admit during a critical phase.<p>The fact that you can inventively criticize your own ideas does not mean they are especially flawed. How many ideas do you know that are so perfect as to be beyond criticism? Even things like fire, the wheel and electricity have their downsides. Importantly, <i>if your enthusiasms can be misplaced, so can your criticisms.</i> In other words, just as you may feel you got carried away by the merits of an idea you had yesterday, you can get carried away by your ability to poke holes in it today. Ration your criticisms in the same manner as your enthusiasms, and accept that both are subjective expressions of your own priorities rather than inherent properties of an idea itself.<p>Lastly, consider whether your critical faculties are telling you to work on something different. Your words remind me of the phrase 'a solution in search of a problem,' and sometimes the world's response to creativity is not rejection but indifference, which is equally dispiriting. Lasers and many other inventions languished unused for many years, so this is nothing to be ashamed of. But if your ideas seem to lack utility, try seeking out problems instead - things that are clearly making life <i>worse</i> for people, but which are agreed to be unavoidable. These domains can be highly lucrative: after all, what are medicine and politics but attempts to mitigate death and taxes? Indeed, many therapists' and consultants' primary skill is that of identifying problems, and distinguishing between symptom and causes.",1294431697

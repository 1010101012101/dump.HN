Instead, classes should be used to further describe the contents of elements in relation to each other. Then all the presentational rules can be kept in CSS, and selectors can be used to style based on the meaning of the content.<p>This means the style of the page can change without modifying the markup. And if the styles are written well enough, they can be applied to any (sane) markup.<p>Oh and +1 for colgroup!",1420873180

8866186,comment,8865662,8865662,0,0,kbar13,,,"having played violin for the majority of my life with years of experience playing in orchestras, I can tell you that the majority of a conductor&#x27;s work is done in preparation with the ensemble. Musicians are more than capable of reading sheet music and keeping time and listening to others in the orchestra to keep things in sync.<p>Conductors are there to make the decision of how music should be interpreted. They will tell musicians to make edits to adjust the how music is performed. This ranges from minor stylistic changes to actual changes to the melody and such.<p>In addition, the passion of a conductor really rubs off of musicians in an orchestra and will inspire them to really put feeling into how they play. This applies to a conductor who doesn&#x27;t know what he/she is doing as well, but with the opposite effect.<p>Therefore, yes, an orchestra will function just fine without a conductor, but you&#x27;ll essentially be replacing a live organism with an mp3 player (but with sprinkles of human error added).",1420872897

Just don&#x27;t. What you should do instead, is write a game, and while writing that game, write its engine.<p>I&#x27;m not making a game. We have an OpenGL Game Engine class in my Game Programming program at college. I&#x27;m creating my game engine with the idea that someone could simply include it as a library and then use its features to develop a game. This Game Engine class is now over, however, I&#x27;m still developing my engine purely for personal learning purposes. Yes, I am creating demos to test features of my engine, but I&#x27;m not writing anything that would be considered a game.<p>Regarding the rest of your comment, I totally agree and understand what you are saying. This actually makes sense, however, it&#x27;s just not the way that we&#x27;ve been taught so far in my program. Being a student, we are familiar with the practices that our teachers use. This makes us somewhat close minded, but it&#x27;s really nice when people (like you) give a completely different way of doing something.<p>Thanks for the help!

The argument for &quot;live migrations&quot; and lambasting of AWS for bouncing servers for the Xen exploit are both completely misguided.<p>The point of the Cloud is not that a server never restarts or has downtime. It&#x27;s that your app runs on many servers in different AZs and regions such that any one server failing is not going to have a real impact and can be easily and quickly replaced.<p>AWS, when bouncing their servers, did them one az and one region at a time. Because of that, if you ran across multiple AZs you would get to test your failure scenarios, but not be down.<p>The author&#x27;s focus on other cloud providers having restarts makes it sound like he&#x27;s saying &quot;Verizon is bad, but in bad company&quot;.

8866169,comment,8862542,8862542,0,0,earth2jason,,,"Well, I think good indexing is key. How do you have your indexes. If they are aligned with what is frequently queried then you should be in good shape. A database of 5-10K users isn&#x27;t difficult these days for any major DBMS. The key lies in the other things attached to the users and items you query. That can run into the millions. Even that is not much, but depending on how many times you query a million row table, it could put a pinch on your optimization.<p>Good database mechanics is key. That is the most important thing in my opinion. That is really the whole point in rails when you are deciding relationships. The abstraction in Rails when deciding what should be the best model structure is the same thing as deciding what should be the best and most efficient table structure in your database.<p>The rave about MongoDB is that it (maybe not quote me on this) &quot;cures&quot; the need for the desire multi-dimensional database. However, even with MontoDB&#x27;s ability to expand due to it&#x27;s not needing a pre-defined structure and the ability to expand out dimensionally to a certain extent, PostgreSQL (claims anyways) is still more efficient if you correctly index your tables (think about how you will be querying) and create the correct relationships. Build out models. Allow flexibility.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget caching. Redis and performing jobs is key in certain situations. However, don&#x27;t get caught up in too much hype. Especially those coming from closed source technologies (Not just talking about caching technologies here but everything in general). They will sell and produce an atmosphere of necessity, but do some research first. Don&#x27;t follow the heard. I am not going to call anyone out on this. Just do the research and think why is that necessary. I&#x27;ve mentioned Redis a few times and maybe that isn&#x27;t even necessary either.<p>Most importantly, put your stuff out there. If it crashes, so what! At least you know you have something. And then you will have people who will give you advice in a coherent direction if necessary.<p>I salute you in your efforts. Now the most important part is put it out there and kick ass!<p>You may even want to look into Redis which is a cache system.",1420872063

They both operate in largely the same niche, and Team Treehouse is definitely the better product (better edited, well-thought out videos, review, examinations and a development environment, all for $25 monthly for 1.000+ videos, while this offers just a single video that&#x27;s less thought-out, not edited as well and has no examination for $18).<p>The other numbers I posted were mostly regarding cost. And cost has no niche. Whether you produce for a broad audience, or a niche audience, if you&#x27;re in a small conference room with an iphone-quality camera recording two dudes working through relatively elementary programming challenges, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether that&#x27;s a niche, or whether that&#x27;s something extremely mainstream to watch. The cost is going to be low. i.e. you can pay a programmer $100 an hour, two of them, for a two-hour video ($400) plus very simple editing, for $750, hell make it $1k if you want.<p>Then compare that to their pricing, and you get to something like 50 people watching a video to break even.<p>In a world of online, digital education, with tons of great coding sessions on youtube for free, I just don&#x27;t think pricing an elementary coding challenge like &#x27;rank a poker hand&#x27; at $18 makes a lot of sense. Seems to me you&#x27;re much better off charging a few bucks and trying to get thousands of people to watch the video instead, or price it at $18 for access to multiple videos for a month, much like their competition which operate in a similar niche with much, much cheaper prices for more professional content, imo.

8866150,comment,8863257,8866060,0,0,graycat,,,"What I&#x27;ve built looks like a Web site to me;
the pages look quite usable.<p>&quot;Client libraries&quot; -- wow.<p>&quot;Interactive&quot; -- my Web site is interactive:
I wrote a session state store, have two more
back end servers, and have SQL Server.  The server
side is plenty complicated, but the client side
is quite simple, and I&#x27;m still missing why 
the client side situation should often be otherwise.<p>Or, what the heck is wrong with just HTML, some
CSS for a little convenience, and some JS if
necessary?  HTML has the basics:  Tables,
links, one line text boxes, multi-line text
boxes, text, images, etc.<p>Pull-downs and roll-overs --
as a user I don&#x27;t like them, so as a programmer
I&#x27;m not using them.  Anything that covers up 
what&#x27;s on the screen I don&#x27;t like for anything
less important than announcing nuclear war.<p>With high irony, we&#x27;re quite productively
using HN with simple HTML, no pull downs or
roll overs, nothing or next to nothing in
icons (I hate icons), 
and, I just had Firefox save this
HN page, some HTML with only a little JS
with the HTML,
two GIFs, 65 lines
of CSS that looks nicely simple, and nothing else.
Works fine.<p>I would think that the &quot;dependencies&quot; would
be handled on the server side with some
help from, say, in real time a session state store and/or
for longer term a database.<p>For CSS, it finally dawned on me:  There can be
another place to put such cases of <i>commonality</i> --
the code that writes out the data to be sent to
the client.  I&#x27;m doing some of that and, then,
using the classes in Microsoft&#x27;s ASP.NET to
generate the data sent to the client.  So, to
change fonts, colors, change the color for
every other line of a table, etc., just do that
in the code that calls the ASP.NET classes.<p>Heck, if want,
change the colors of lines in the tables
based on the phases of the moon, the temperature
where the user&#x27;s IP address is, for each time they
see a new copy of the page, with no reds next to
greens if know that the user is male (25% of the
male population is partially red-green color
blind, including me), etc.  Try that in CSS!<p>Generally server side programming is easier than
client side programming because (1) on the server
have access to about all there is in computing and
(2) on the client are throttled by, ugh, JS and,
still, can&#x27;t really see the stuff run.<p>For what bytes I&#x27;m sending
to the users, I&#x27;m trying to keep that simple.
I&#x27;m losing why it should be complicated,
say much more complicated than just HN,
or, really, why the CSS that is the subject of this
thread is such an aid.  Or, for generating what
the user sees, I&#x27;m using essentially Microsoft&#x27;s
most powerful programming language, the .NET
version of Visual Basic (C# is different
mostly only just in syntactic sugar) --
gotta be a lot more powerful than 
JS on the client or CSS.<p>Why send complicated stuff to the clients?
Why program in JS unless really have to?
Why try to make new features of CSS
ways to <i>write software</i>?  What&#x27;s so
important to do that often need
JS instead of just HTML?<p>Again, I&#x27;m trying to learn.",1420871236

Nor about synchronization, timing, any of that technical stuff - that&#x27;s all a very small part of it.  The conductor emotes the entire interpretation and inspires the musicality of the ensemble in a particular direction.  Some of this might be rehearsed ahead of time, but it&#x27;s also alive during the live performance.<p>It is also completely possible for an ensemble to do their own rehearsal preparation, and to perform without a conductor.  It&#x27;ll be fine and musical, but they&#x27;re not including the interpretation that a conductor themselves can bring to the performance.  Even the conductor-less orchestras will discover new interpretations during live performance if an excellent conductor hopped up on the podium to lead them.  And for pieces that require a lot of certain elements (rubato, many changing tempos or meters), a lack of conductor will leave the music sounding a bit rote.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s always an old joke to consider that conductors aren&#x27;t really needed... in high school, we pissed off our orchestra teacher before the final concert by putting a sign on his podium: &quot;1. Raise arms.  2. Wave arms around until the music stops.  3. Lower arms.&quot;  There are also the pops in the park concerts where the local bank president will be invited up on stage to lead a Sousa march... all of that stuff is well and good, but it&#x27;s all a joke.  Of <i>course</i> conductors are needed - music suffers without them.<p>[edit] I should note that conducting to <i>video</i> is an entirely different art form than traditional conducting/performance.  Different conversation.",1420870630

8866121,comment,8865662,8865662,0,0,devonkim,,,"There are orchestras that have performed conductorless fine. I watched my old bass professor, Barry Lieberman also from Orpheus chamber orchestra, play in a group of 12 and they did perfectly fine with American String Project and they all listened to each other to get it done.<p>The fundamental reason that conductorless orchestras over 20 don&#x27;t occur in practice is that music written for that many tends to be complex enough to warrant a conductor. Similar to how start-up companies probably don&#x27;t need much regulation and a board of directors while multi-billion dollar enterprises invariably do, elaborate pieces are precisely the domain of symphonies. You&#x27;re not about to need a conductor to have the London Philharmonic play Pachabel Canon or something, right? And boy would it seem awkward for a quartet to attempt Mozart&#x27;s Requiem Mass. It&#x27;s why Metallica with a symphony sounds really, really forced - Master of Puppets is more arranged like you would an Ã©tude or chamber concerto, not some symphonic score with tons of movements and five layers of polyrhythms.<p>Conductors are very much like popular music DJs and MCs in that they&#x27;re supposed to be expert listeners in charge of coordination of many parts that could easily fall apart potentially if the musicians started to have trouble listening to each other in an especially complex piece of music. Stravinsky works come to mind, and even world class symphonies can (and certainly have!) fall apart on pieces like Rite of Spring or any movement from the Firebird Suite.<p>As an example of such leadership, I saw the National Symphony Orchestra play in sync with the music from Fantasia 2000 and the only way the orchestra would have known to STOP was because the conductor could see that the video did not match the piece because the orchestra faced the audience. The discipline it takes to full stop an orchestra also reflects the professionalism too. Those that grew up playing music in groups are quite familiar with stopping constantly and taking a while to slow to a stop every time, but you don&#x27;t put up with that as pros. But in my defense, I just kept going out of boredom of playing maybe 6 minutes in an hour while we kept screwing with the violins or trumpets for the whole time. If people don&#x27;t practice, we all suffer.",1420870364

Microsoft named their Silverlight search front end Tafiti which is also derived from Kiswahili (tafuta - to search). Kiswahili is a widely spoken language in East Africa. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language</a>). There are many other occurrences of the language in popular American culture! It makes sense to borrow words from other languages when there is ""just no good option left"" as you yourself say.

We paid him a handsome fee (funds obtained by another angel investor and our CEO, who was already wealthy) as well as giving him a chunk of stock options. He's a great guy. I'd rather not reveal who I am, but the person in question has a relatively high-profile blog. ",1196973351

86774,comment,86668,86668,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Steve's a nice guy and I enjoy reading his rants, but there's one thing he's wrong about: Amazon.  A horrible, horrible company, where bright engineers are managed by horrible horrible idiots and nothing is done very well... Amazon doesn't believe in having engineers do management so they hire people with no skills other than asskissing (its the most political work environment I've ever seen) to manage engineers-- thus you have the joyful experience of having someone who knows absolutely nothing about programming telling you that you're doing something wrong based on a misunderstanding of something he overheard someone else say about a whole other programming language.<p>There are a few decent engineers who make it thru the incompetance filter (amazon calls this ""Raising the bar"") and become managers, and obviously steve wored for one.  But the vast majority of people managing engineers at Amazon are non-engineers.  And the managers managers are even worse- paper pushers whose primary goal is their own personal advancement-- not the product, not the quality of the work and certainly not hte profitability of the company.<p>Worst environment for engineers, ever.",1196973181

A good example is bringing in a new ""business savvy"" CEO (and/or board of directors) to potentially replace you.<p>Are there any legal tools that allow a founder to maintain control of the company (in a voting sense) even if the VC firm wants 50% or more equity?<p>If Sequoia invested in your startup and asked for 50% would YOU complain?",1196971224

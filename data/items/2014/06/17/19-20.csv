That being said, I am not convinced by the methodology used in the study, specifically the period used for measuring the performance: 3 years. It sounds like a lot of time, but actually, I would expect a truly great CEO to undertake projects with a 5 years or more horizon. There&#x27;s this great interview of Bezos discussing the point of focusing on quarterly results vs long term. So an alternative explanation for the findings could be: the highest paid CEOs invest in 5-10 years projects, so their results after 3 years are below average.<p>Again, I repeat that even before reading the study, I intuitively agreed with their conclusion, but I&#x27;m not so sure about their argument to prove it",1403035084

We don&#x27;t. We are professionally programmers, but once I step outside of my job I am no longer a programmer. Fitness shouldn&#x27;t be targeted at a specific profession, instead it should be targeted at people who work in similar conditions. Office jobs vs programmers, which makes more sense to target? There&#x27;s way more people working office jobs with health issues from sitting, but the converse isn&#x27;t necessarily true about programmers. A programmer might not work in an office, they might work at some hip startup with exercise equipment everywhere. My employer has it&#x27;s own gym with personal trainers, but I doubt most small non-engineering offices do.

Except for the Asians (who do routinely break out), the kids of most cultural groups were more likely to laugh in the teachers&#x27; faces!

There are 68 Heat employees [2] not counting the other players, and definitely not counting the arena workers. During the 2011 lockout, after they signed Lebron, Wade and Bosh, the Heat cut staff salaries by 25%.[1] Of course, not everyone&#x27;s salaries were cut... like the people with lucrative contracts.<p>The word &#x27;Reasonable&#x27; means &quot;appropriate, fair, moderate, of sound judgment, and sensible&quot;. To me, cutting people&#x27;s salaries so they have to go find second or third jobs, and giving someone who isn&#x27;t even working over 10% of the revenue of your company, is not reasonable.<p>By artificially inflating the salaries of players you create multiple problems.[4] Teams with wealthier owners can buy up all the best players and trounce all the other teams. Costs for the teams skyrocket, requiring that salaries then be cut to be able to pay the players more, and requiring more complex ways of making enough money to pay the players. It puts an unfair advantage on the players in terms of determining how the company deals with them. And it creates a disproportionate leverage that de-emphasizes the game, and focuses more on the pain threshold of the market that&#x27;s paying them. It affects the entire national economy as cities are affected by the touring of the games, building of stadiums, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think anybody&#x27;s salary should be directly proportionate to the amount of money they make for an employer. While it&#x27;s one of the favorite tenets of people like Gordon Gekko, it doesn&#x27;t make for a fair, sensible, or moderate decision, whether you&#x27;re thinking about the fate of the company, the welfare of the majority of the employees who work for it, or the economy it serves.<p>[1] <a href=""http://heatzone.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2011/10/04/as-lockout-continues-heat-staffers-suffer-more-salary-cuts/?cxtype=rss_954355"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heatzone.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2011/10/04/as-lockout...</a> [2] <a href=""http://www.nba.com/heat/contact/directory_list.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nba.com/heat/contact/directory_list.html</a> [3] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/teams/miami-heat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/teams/miami-heat/</a> [4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap</a>",1403034860

I can put together a fridge full of zero-prep foods that&#x27;s nutritionally sufficient, but I&#x27;ll probably want to shoot myself after 2 weeks.<p>Also, one of the &quot;things&quot; about NYC is that going out to eat <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> take much more time. Having food prepared for you is not an event, and you don&#x27;t need to drive a few miles to get to a restaurant. From my apartment I can be ass-in-seat at 4-5 different eateries in the amount of time it&#x27;d take for you to start the car and pull out of the driveway. There&#x27;s a reason so many of us complain about our small apartments but wouldn&#x27;t trade them in for anything.<p>NYC has nearly perfected the craft of preparing food for you cheaply, quickly, and tastily. You can eat cuisines from the world over, a new one each day, without breaking the bank and without traveling more than 10 minutes from your home.<p>The sheer density of restaurants also helps quality. The are so many restaurants offering similar cuisines in any given area that they compete fiercely on price and quality. The result is that you can get an amazing quality of food at sub-suburban prices.<p>Even if you prepare your own food, in NYC the grocery is so close by you can buy in small volume and wide variety. You can practice an incredibly varied menu in your own kitchen because you don&#x27;t have to buy in anything resembling bulk. You can buy just enough of some ingredient for one meal, and switch to something entirely different the next day, with little logistical impact. Swinging by the bakery for a fresh loaf of bread is a matter of course - you don&#x27;t have to pull into a parking lot, park the car, or anything - it&#x27;s just on your way from wherever you were going.<p>The &quot;sell&quot; for NYC food is a combination of variety, quality, and price.",1403034603

Now, as to the following:<p>1. fsiekfen: &quot;Even so I&#x27;d like to believe Stapledon really was traveling among the stars &#x27;in some way&#x27;, also his description of the out of body experience is oddly similar to credible accounts later in the 20th century and might be autobiographical but if not could be explained by him reading earlier accounts of this psychological effect.&quot;<p>2. nkoren: &quot;Still, like you, I do like to imagine that Stapledon tapped into something that was somehow beyond the ordinary. I don&#x27;t feel like speculating beyond that, but however he did it, Star Maker is an extraordinary book.&quot;<p>The two of you and others I assume, might be curious to know about &quot;The Opening of The Eyes&quot; (there used to be an online version here (<a href=""http://olafstapledonarchive.webs.com/openingoftheeyes_index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://olafstapledonarchive.webs.com/openingoftheeyes_index....</a>) but it&#x27;s down now. If you like, I could make the .mobi file I created available somewhere from the various parts.<p>Not commonly known, as far as I can tell, even among Stapledon fans. It was published posthumously by his wife and is written in the first person. Essentially, it&#x27;s an essay by him to his &quot;creator&quot;. I won&#x27;t comment on what that entails; hopefully his work speaks for itself. But within that story he mentions this - the exact quote:<p>&quot;Long ago (it was while I was scrambling on a rugged coast, where great waves broke in blossom on the rocks) I had a sudden fantasy of man&#x27;s whole future, aeon upon aeon of strange vicissitudes and gallant endeavours in world after world, seeking a glory never clearly conceived, often betrayed, but little by little revealed.&quot;<p>It says... something. I&#x27;m not sure what. Either way, the piece is a powerful expose on the author. You get to see a lot into his mindset, and even into the challenges he faced in relation to his proposed philosophies. Some interesting commentary on Christianity as well, among others.<p>But in the end, I guess you get the feeling there&#x27;s more to him than simple imaginative power. The concept of &quot;fiction as cover for non-fiction (so people will read your stuff without calling you a lunatic) tends to crop up in some of his works too. Either way, his works are nothing short of incredible.<p>Cheers",1403033407

Off of the top of my head, hackers are &quot;lazy&quot; (in that we aim to optimize and remove redundancy) and are convinced by science, so if you can prove that your videos are shown to be efficient, effortless (meaning everything but the workout is taken care of for you), and that it delivers marketable results, then I think you might have something.<p>[1] <a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-mi...</a>",1403033173

Seems to me that Switchboard would be the ideal platform upon which to develop such services .. among other things too.  See any gotcha&#x27;s?<p>Its always amazed me that automated email is not used more and more for basic business processes - sure, we have mailing lists and autoresponders and all sorts of things like that, but the fact that most language/tech stacks don&#x27;t really treat email as the human-maintained message queue, with first class priorities, seems a little lacking ..

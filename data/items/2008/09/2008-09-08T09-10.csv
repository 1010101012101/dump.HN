Perhaps the thing that is repeated and the style of repetition is more important than simply repeating.<p>In other words, once you generalize the article enough to get some meaning from it, you're left with the empty feeling that the obvious was stated and the hard parts were left out.<p>Thanks for taking the time to explain it to me. I should have explained myself better but was trying to be as terse as possible.",1220867956

I see these often enough in production -- I feel no need to give myself more ugly, scary bugs to fix just for the experience.",1220867850

The origin of ""Six degrees of separation"" presumes that each individual in the chain knows the next link personally.<p>Here's how the original experiment worked:

(""And you should too, kids!"")<p>To authors of DSLs for their special hardware or daemon or whatever -- I don't want to learn your retarded homegrown programming language.  Give me a library for a language I already know.  (Specific gripe -- lighttpd config files.  It's not quite Lisp, it's not quite Perl... It's USELESS.  Instead of doing what I want, I have to work around the author's idea of a programming language.  Ick.)",1220866978

( This offer will likely go on reddit, my apologies if you see it more than once. )<p>I am looking for a haskellish/pythonic HN reader for a senior dev/Technical director. 
I need someone able to model <i>and</i> code well (No architect who never codes). 
The ability to communicate well with a team is also a big plus.
You don't need to speak french (we are in France) but a reasonnably good english is mandatory.<p>If You :<p>* like coding 4+ hours straight.<p>* like to solve a coding problem elegantly (and are bothered if can't)<p>* like and read <i>real</i> CS books (SICP, TAOCP, CTM etc...)<p>* code in haskell, python and c++.<p>* are a gamer (this one is optionnal)<p>* are interested in computer graphics (optionnal too)<p>You fit the bill. I would like to talk to you. contact me  (""contact at gamr7 dot com"").<p>What we offer:<p>* interesting problems and creative freedom<p>* quality of life (no overtime, sunny countryside, french food and low rent)<p>* a pay in Euros<p>* confortable workplace, etc...<p>* coding in haskell, python.<p>Note : I looked at the etiquette doc. It says nothing about posting job offers. I really thinks that this one fits well within the HN community, it fits the ""could interest a hacker"" criteria. I didn't find any way to directly post in the jobs section.<p>Edit: added email contact .",1220866164

But my room is pretty clean, no junk on the floor, just some dishes at my desk and some clothes on my bed. I like my floor to be clean and i like to have a lot of open space in my room, so all my stuff is close to the walls, so i can do some walking in my room or some push-ups or something other than siting at my desk. I also have some nice relaxing calendars with girls on them, i find having girls on your wallpaper to be distracting, but no problem having them on you real wall. The main problem with my room is heat, its an east room, so the first 6 hours of the day its constantly heated up by the sun, and the concrete is hot enough to heat the room in the afternoon and the early night. Next summer i an getting a new air conditioner!",1220864932

Furthermore, that logic suggests that anyone who chooses to ignore advertising rather than just blocking it is also guilty because they're depriving the publisher of a potential income too.

6525725,comment,6525008,6525008,7,0,Nanzikambe,,,"As an IT professional that has lived in RSA and several other countries in the region, I have to say this is absolutely common place.<p>Local industry giants with preferred partner/solution provider status with <INSERT GIANT CORP HERE> will lobby and get F/OSS solutions knocked out of the running especially where public tenders are involved. They will of course then use the corrupt officials co-opted into this process to milk the budget for absurdly expensive solutions to non-existent problems.<p>A long time ago, in a country I won&#x27;t name, I was contracted to provide local support for the installations of PCs in rural schools. Upon turning up at the regional center, I had access to a warehouse with a gigantic stack of PCs to be delivered. I merrily went about installing them at every school locally. I&#x27;ve never had more fun or a better challenge, every installation was unique. One site needed a full solar installation because of proximity to a township where power theft was rampant meant electricity on the schools side was virtually never available. At another site, I teamed up with a local carpenter to build 30 simple desks and benches, leaving the hardware sitting on bare concrete floors seemed absurd. For seven months this went on, I never saw another contractor doing the same as I did, yet the pile of PCs diminished so I assumed there must be several others. I queried to find out who they were so we could coordinate, I didn&#x27;t want to spend hours driving to a site only to find they&#x27;d already been. That never happened and I never did get a response.<p>The problems begun when it came to more remote areas. Firstly there was significantly more hardware per student allocated for the rural areas, than urban areas, which was puzzling. Secondly I was not permitted to go and install them, I was told my fuel expenses wouldn&#x27;t be covered. When I offered to waive those, I was told there was no point, because they would require upgrades shortly. The vendor advised we leave them another two months and they would have the service packs rolled out in the central storage site, then the hardware could be delivered. Their stated intention was to save the local govt money. How very noble. Over the course of the next month, that pile of undeliverable hardware diminished significantly as the various people from the purchasing process cashed in by selling it to local vendors on the cheap, some of it was probably re-exported. Who knows. Nobody cares, there was no investigation, that was over a decade ago - the entire process has probably repeated several times since then.<p>It&#x27;s absurd. It&#x27;s arrogant. It&#x27;s corrupt. It&#x27;s ultimately detrimental to everybody involved and robs the most desperate of a resource that just might have lifted them out of poverty. It&#x27;s Africa.  Sorry for the ramble, I never can just explain how much I love and hate that place.<p>Edit: spellin&#x27;",1381381138

Subsequently, I&#x27;ve worked with some smaller retailers.<p>First of all, managers and business owners buy these systems.  But they don&#x27;t actually use them.  They will sooner listen to the sales guy&#x27;s pitch than the bitching from the employees.  When you pay customer service staff the minimum wage that shows that you don&#x27;t value them and as a boss, certainly know more than they could possibly know.<p>I think you comments are based on 2nd generation systems, i.e. ones that are more or less a PC with cash drawer and receipt printer attached. The big manufacturers have cornered the market by claiming that &quot;only they are big enough to take care of your business.&quot;  Typically the cost of customisation is so high that POS screens, functions are not updated as business changes.<p>The 3rd generation systems, based on iPads and other tablets are shaking up some segments.  Of course, the struggle against the above two biases.<p>In case your wondering, 1st gen was stand-alone cash registers, whether mechanical or electronic.<p>In any large business, e.g. a chain, the POS integrates with the ERP systems to optimise the supply chain and distribution functions.  This integration, alone, snookers many smaller, newer entrants.<p>Of course, I think you have hit the nail on the head, it is CRUD, unglamorous and once you confront the customisation and integration issues, a lot of hard work.

It&#x27;s probably for the best that we usually maneuver around these black holes on HN.<p>There are better places for such discussion.  However, I consider it a general rule that in all hangouts for intellectually curious people, if you flippantly say something controversial, expect to be challenged.<p>>However, having said that, I&#x27;m fully aware that no amount of argumentation can convince a believer (see my other comments on how religion closes that avenue after it infects a brain). I&#x27;m sorry if all that sounds pompous, arrogant, or just plain stupid to you.<p>I am not primarily arguing to convince you, but for the benefit of observers who are not as personally involved in our exchange.  Besides, I think you are probably a thoughtful and intelligent person, and as such I would not expect you to be convinced of something over the course of a debate.  Rather, if you did change your mind it would be on your own time and after much reflection.<p>I am sorry, however, that you believe religion is a incurable mind virus.  Perhaps if you did not believe as you do, then you would take a different approach with your arguments.<p>>Other things that don&#x27;t rank high on my list of credibility indicators are: the number of people believing something, and the social authority of the people believing it.<p>This, in and of itself, doesn&#x27;t make you any different than a conspiracy theorist.  I don&#x27;t mean to say that you are one, and I don&#x27;t necessarily hold authority or consensus very highly myself, just that rejecting them doesn&#x27;t tell me much about your rationality.  Regardless, my point was not that you should believe something because a lot of people, some of whom were pretty smart, also believed it.  More about my actual point below.<p>>Nevertheless: it&#x27;s possible for a scientist to be completely wrong about most things, and yet produce valid scientific theories. Only when superstition and science collide directly, work usually suffers. Otherwise cognitive dissonance works pretty well. You also have to keep in mind that historical figures had a different cultural outlook than we do today, and I&#x27;m boring myself as I write this.<p>OK, my point: cognitive dissonance is a pretty different phenomenon from infection by a memetic parasite.  Your claim was that religion &quot;has evolved to competitively inhibit the brain&#x27;s logical and moral facilities&quot; and that it &quot;poisons the ability to freely reason about data specifically and the environment generally&quot;.  If people with religious belief were so inhibited in their logical facilities, and could not freely reason about data or the environment, we would not expect them to be able to make mathematical, scientific, or technological advancements.  They clearly have, and they continue to do so despite the cultural outlook of today (Knuth, for instance, is still alive).<p>Furthermore, when I talk about the large number of people who are religious, I am not saying &quot;it&#x27;s silly to think so many people are wrong&quot;; I am saying &quot;it&#x27;s silly to think so many people are mentally handicapped&quot;.  Especially since so many of these people are able to contribute to business, the arts, the sciences, etc.<p>Now, I am not saying that you are stupid, or handicapped (Indeed, your HN profile and web site indicate the opposite). Just that your thesis is bad psychology.<p>>I think a bit of brutal honesty is in order.\nYou will find that, in this, we are in agreement.",1381379465

Their primary customers were very large corporate retailers, the cost per unit and for development was prohibitively high and because these were giant corporate IT projects the results were awful for the end users.<p>At the lower end the retailers got those really basic electronic cash registers (ECRs)with lots of buttons and LCD displays showing numbers only. These were out of Japan mostly and usability was not a priority.<p>The biggest issue with these ECRs was that they were trying to solve too many end-user requirements, so they all sucked for all but the most simple transactions.<p>With the PC a bunch of DOS and then windows based retail POs systems emerged - mostly awful usability due to Windows and DOS. The best did made it very efficient for a particular industry. E.g. for service stations their systems were integrated with the pumps in the forecourt and a back office system, all of which likely linked to the oil company. But it all stalled for years until the cloud and iOS based systems came along.<p>Right now we are in a moment of rapid change, with the end-user experience becoming hugely better for both the customer and the retail assistant. Still plenty to come so watch this space.<p>(Source 4 years in Mobil Oil, 2 doing payments and POS projects, 2 in the field, and I&#x27;m an investor in Vend)<p>(1) <a href=""http://vendhq.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vendhq.com/</a>",1381378915

6525609,story,,,1,1,calebgilbert,"Ask HN: Prefab frameworks vs custom within your own open source projects?",,"I&#x27;m working on a large&#x27;ish open source platform which is meant to be heavily extensible via third-party modules.<p>On the one hand there are a lot of nice prefab JavaScript MV* frameworks out there, of which I have some experience with. If I expected to be the only person, or nearly the only person, writing code for this project I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to grab a pre-existing framework.<p>That said, in this particular circumstance I can think of a few potential downsides to choose a prefab framework:<p>1. Trying to keep up with versioning of a prefab framework sounds like a potential nightmare. I want to be able to focus primarily on features for the application/framework itself, and not be a slave to the version of JS framework that lies beneath the surface.<p>2. There is so much fragmentation within the JS framework space that whatever I choose would leave a majority of people unfamiliar with it (and possibly alienated). If I rolled my own for the project everyone would at least be on the same page.<p>3. Something as foundational as a MV* framework demands that you somewhat marry it. You can decouple all you want but swapping from Backbone.js to Angularjs (or vice-versa) is not a small task for anything non-trivial. The codebase for my project is large enough that whatever choices are made, will have to be lived with for some time. I really dislike the idea of marrying my own project&#x27;s success or failure to any one prefab framework. (e.g., some new hotness comes out tomorrow and perceptually makes what the project uses look like yesterday&#x27;s garbage - doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be such an issue if the foundation was custom in the first place)<p>So roll-my-own MVC architecture, or would using a prefab framework within my project be less of hassle than I&#x27;m worried about?<p>Thank you in advance for any constructive experience/opinions!",1381378729

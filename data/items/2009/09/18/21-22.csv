831272,comment,830660,831137,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Sotomayor has not suggested such rights don't exist - how you drew that conclusion, I cannot understand - and the WSJ's summary of proceedings seems misleading to me.<p>The transcript is at <a href=""http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-205[Reargued].pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transc...</a> and I urge people to read it. The relevant portion is as follows:<p><i>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Going back to the question of stare decisis, the one thing that is very interesting about this area of law for the last 100 years is the active involvement of both State and Federal legislatures in trying to find that balance between the interest of protecting in their views how the electoral process should proceed and the interests of the First Amendment.<p>And so my question to you is, once we say they can't, except on the basis of a compelling government interest narrowly tailored, are we cutting off or would we be cutting off that future democratic process?</i> Because what you are suggesting is that the courts who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with, not Austin or McConnell, but the fact that the Court imbued a creature of State law with human characteristics.<p><i>But we can go back to the very basics that\nway, but wouldn't we be doing some more harm than good by a broad ruling in a case that doesn't involve more business corporations and actually doesn't even involve the traditional nonprofit organization? It involves an advocacy corporation that has a very particular interest.</i><p>In other words, she is asking the attorney for Citizen's united if he is aware that the basis of his argument for invalidating Austin McConnell (in which a court ruled that Congress had the right to balance electoral and first amendment considerations) would create the basis for a challenge to corporate personhood itself, by making the right of corporate speech pendant on past court decisions which <i>assumed</i> the validity of corporate personhood without ever having formally established it.<p>Your point about employees and shareholders enjoying free speech <i>qua</i> individuals makes ethical sense, but have you considered that treating the corporation as proxy for the rights of its human owners or agents would conflict with the idea of corporate severability, the legal framework which protects shareholders from direct legal liability for wrongdoing carried out on behalf of a corporation by its officers?<p>sorry for the long-windedness :-/",1253311138

(assuming that the attributes needed to be a good editor or author are not a lot more common than the attributes required to be a SysAdmin.)<p>Now, there is a lot of difference between doing something you like for not very much money, and doing it for free, so you might be correct that people won't do it unless there is at least some money, but I see evidence that people will do it for less money than they could get doing other things.<p>as for the 'chicken and egg' part of the credibility issue, you are certainly correct if the same gateway/content producer relationship as we have now continues, but there are other models, like the model hacker news and other aggrigators use.  If creators 'publish' content themselves to the 'net, then the 'gateways' just link to the content they find credible.<p>Now, the question is ""how does the aggrigator decide what links are worthy?""    there are many ways to do this, but I suspect the best may end up being subject matter experts running small aggrigators that cover their own interests.",1253310540

In this case, he knows how easy it is/will be to transition Skype to be web-based and get around its current core technology.

Although ""Being arbitrary and protective about what products you allow people to build onto your own products is not inherently a restraint of trade"", perhaps some forms of it should be.

That narrow protection (if it even applies to your set-top box) should most certainly not apply to value-added user apps on a pocket computer.<p>If a role of government is to ensure economic growth, is it wise to use Apply as the foothold case to create rules to disallow this level of protectionism?

It fits <i>perfectly</i> as a result, and certainly a lot better than its store bought state - which was acceptable but not <i>good</i>.<p>I don't think this qualifies as ""foppish"" clothing budget. I don't think I've ever even bought a shirt over $100 - like I said, I'm not fashionista. I'd rather pay to get mid-end clothing <i>right</i> as opposed to go for the luxuriantly expensive stuff.<p>Also, ""well cut"" is a very large gradient. Yes, you can buy a vest from a store that fits decently without any alterations whatsoever - but that's also a long way from fitting you like a glove. The point I was communicating is: if you know and have a regular tailor, you can get the absolute perfect fit from factory wares without much extra expense.<p>The extra bit of fit has a lot of profound effects that are well worth the minimal amount of money you're spending on it. The clothes become <i>yours</i>. They're not a ""size 10"" or whatever, they're fit for <i>you</i>. All the minor bits that aren't quite right are made right, and even untrained eyes <i>can</i> tell the difference. Given how little it costs I really don't see a reason not to do it.",1253308531

It sounds like you're doing a lot of interesting stats work (especially looking at the analysis stuff a little more), I'd be rather interested in hearing a little more about what is going on behind on the server side of things.<p>As far as working on complexity, and explanation of what probabilistic predictions are would probably help a lot of people. It wouldn't surprise me if you get a lot of unhappy people come Spring who said ""BUT! You said I would get in, and I didn't!"" While it would be nice to think that anyone looking at going to college is going to have a basic understanding of probability, you can't just assume that. I would also highlight the ""Top Action Items"" a little more, you have to dig for it a little bit. Especially for Juniors (right now) or Sophomores (come spring), they have plenty of time to bring up grades and/or retake the SAT/ACT several times to bring things up. An aggregate ""Adding X to your SAT score raises your chances of admission by Y%"" on the college matches page would be good. It doesn't help current seniors, but it will help those planning ahead a little bit.<p>Oh, and you're right. It brought my score up roughly 200 points in all the areas, to more around where I would expect it to be.",1253308509

This means that chances of continuing success are lower than appears to outsiders, and the insiders are wise to sell at the temporarily favorable valuations.  The VCs can be easily convinced to agree merely by frank discussion of the weaknesses, but both the founders and the VCs are motivated to claim that the sale was best for everyone, and to have the initial transition or work-out go smoothly.  Once the money is in the bank and any hold-backs are settled and released, there is time to drift away from the acquirer.",1253308087

And the inherent floating point erro causes the said 0.01 difference. I was fresh into C, third, maybe fourth class. You can be sure that no one had the least idea why that happened. Obviously, we all took the easy way out, used integers multiplied by 100 to work around it, but you couldn't expect me to figure out by myself WHY that was happening. This error, and the explanation of why it happened was the introduction to floating point class that we had after we saw it happen.

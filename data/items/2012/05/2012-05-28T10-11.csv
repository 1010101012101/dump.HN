From time to time I experience lucid dreams and I try to interact with the people in my dream but only if the people seem nice. Because of the fact that I know that I am dreaming and that I am in control I do things that I usually would not do. For example a couple of months ago I actually touched someone I like in my lucid dream. When I woke up I felt very good. I had extreme confidence in myself again. Lucid dreaming helps me a lot. I can try things. I can expose myself to things I am afraid of and usually when I have done something in a lucid dream and the experience was not too bad I am able to try it in the real world.",1338202749

Possibly because it borrows from some of the film-noir tropes and is written in a more ""literary"" style than much SF. But I'm a huge Gibson fan so may well be biased :-)<p>A couple of things to bear in mind when reading it.<p>First Neuromancer was published in <i>1984</i>. It was the novel that pretty much invented the whole cowboy-hacker image that's been reused a bazzilion times since. The whole idea of ""cyberspace"" the ""matrix"". Of custom hacker tools. Super-human AIs with less than human motivations. Of an international data-sphere used by companies. The rise of the global multi-national. The magical influence of the 1% of the 1% superrich. All of it in a much more ""gritty"" realistic world. Neither dystopian or utopian.<p>So much of this is just the general background to the whole SF genre now. Or indeed reality.<p>Just as a book of ideas it just blew me away at the time I first read it in 1989. Five years after it was first published. When most of the world had no clue what e-mail or the internet was. When my neighbour thought the AI in my degree was ""Artificial Insemination"" not ""Artificial Intelligence"" (that was a really confusing and funny conversation - ""I never knew you were interested in farming"" :-)<p>Second was how it compared to the rest of SF at the time. The kind of fiction folk like William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Bruce Sterling, Pat Cadigan, Rudy Rucker, and John Shirley were putting out was just so... different from most of the SF that was out there at the time. Gibson's was the first novel length work I'd read in that style and... wow... it just blew me away.<p>Don't get me wrong - I love Ender's game too. In the same way I can love ""Of Mice and Men"" and ""Moby Dick"" - despite there radically different literary styles.<p>It's hard for me to divorce Neuromancer from the time I read it in.

I thought about calling up to ask which one actually applied, but I couldn't stand the thought of fighting through a phone-menu/customer-service/hold dance to actually get an answer, and more importantly, I don't have any trust that the answer I would have received would have been correct anyway!<p>> Right, so I just assumed I'd login and change my country to Australia. Wrong!<p>The admin interface ""worked"" for me, but the problem is, you <i>can't</i> change your registered country anyway. I went round and round in circles, and would actually end up at the South African store regularly, for some reason. Not to mention that if you visit the business store, the Photoshop subscription plan isn't even present.<p>I was too lazy to bother calling them up to change it, so I just registered another account (I didn't have any previous purchases). Then I ran into the next problem: I had no idea how to actually <i>download</i> the program! The Adobe store redirected me to... <i>a blank page</i>. And in the 5 emails they sent me regarding the subscription there were <i>no links</i> to download the program. Somehow I discovered the Adobe Creative Cloud Client, which finally let me put in my login and download/install the software.<p>God help someone like my (artistically inclined) mother if she ever wanted to do the same. It really is amazing how a process can be so broken. It's broken enough that I'd consider going and searching for a pirate version <i>purely to avoid</i> having to deal with Adobe.

It has been pretty standard(I have some friends and family who have been doing exactly this) to have a temporal contract in any job (6 months or 1 year) and when it  finished you went to receive your unemployment pay till you finish it, 6 months or so without looking for a job, just enjoying. Then, and only then you looked for another job!. You can not repeat more than 3 periods of 6 months, because the company will have to transform your contract to a fixed one. So it doest really matter how good you are, you are going to be fired no matter what after a year and a half.<p>Work contracts here are a bad joke (they have changed the law, but I dont think it will really change that much as they only made firing cheaper, hiring is still very expensive). Companies are forced to hire people with this horrible contracts that dont allow you to get a fixed job, because it is very difficult to be flexible with fixed employees (autopun no intended). Workers become more expensive as time passes, no matter how good or bad the worker is. Also firing somebody when he has been a lot of time in the company was very expensive (40 days for year worked, now reduced to 20)<p>Unions are defending the rights of the fixed employees but almost no one can get one of those contracts, so they are not defending the workers that really need to be defended, but the unions status quo. Also the companies have gamed the system and played with the contract conditions of hard working people, discouraging hard work (good workers are not payed more here, in general they prefer by far a cheap and unexperienced worker than a more experienced and productive one that happens to be more expensive).<p>We have a system in which from school hard working people were considered dumb, and made jokes of them. You pass from one course to the next even if you fail. Why are you going to study that hard if it is possible to earn more working in construction, and receiving the unemployment help?. The same happens in the companies (not all of them of course, but it is really common), why are you going to work hard if they are going to fire you anyway when the year and a half expires no matter how good you are.<p>That is why a lot of young people cant afford to go living alone, of course is a cultural problem (not moving far from your town to get a job, requesting the best job conditions even if you are not the best worker nor have experience, etc..), but working and social conditions for young people have not been very encouraging to do much differently, in fact the opposite has been true.<p>The excess of cheap money around made people to see working as time lost. Much better go gambling (invest) in your flat, after all you were supposed to be able to sell it for double in 3 or 4 years.<p>You can also add the cultural loath to the EMPRESARIO (business owner). Here if your business is making money, youll be suspicious of stealing from your costumers or/and your employees (maybe is a catholic sin?, or simply good ol  envy). People rather be a civil servant or be unemployed than be an employee and much less try your own business . Now it seems that people is changing the way they look at entrepreneurship, mostly due to the  internet and Facebook, and of course necessity.<p>All this doesnt mean that there is no really hard working people in Spain, there is, but in general it wasnt seen as something to be proud of. More like kind of stupid (this depends heavily on your social extraction, lower levels where the ones that fell more deeply in this trap).<p>Maybe this deep crisis will have the effect of reseting all this broken system, and a change to a more rational one.

But very few of the very many people with various back issues get them properly checked, and if you have any kind of damage to the actual tissues of your spine, than adding 500lbs of extra force acting on them certainly won't help and I don't think we need extra research to see that ;) I guess it also depends what ""heavy"" means to you - the weight used in a deadlift will always be higher than in most over exercises, but it is not uncommon for people to lift 2, 3 or 4 times their own weight.",1338199520

4032717,comment,4030884,4032481,2,0,draven,,,"Another anecdotal data point: I managed to make my back pain disappear with a combination of deadlifts, squats with good form and stretching of hip flexors. It also fixed some knee issue (side effect of strengthening the legs I guess.) Having recently moved I haven't taken the time to get a gym subscription. After 2 months of sitting all day I managed to hurt my back while sleeping (yep, it's ridiculous); I couldn't bend to tie my shoelaces for one week...<p>So yep, I'm convinced lifting heavy stuff is good for your back (IF you use good form, of course.)",1338199469

Then drawTriangle() become an action in some monad (I imagined a State one) and renderScene() is just a pure function using some monadic computations (doing something like evalState (drawTriangle ...)).<p>I don't know how to explain that without analogies to Haskell (which, I presume, author deliberately avoids), though.",1338199307

131186,comment,130757,131063,0,0,pchristensen,,,"It's hard to make definitive statements about field as huge as ""software"" or ""engineering"".  Yes, there are areas of software with high requirements for safety (avionics), performance (air traffic control), etc, just like there are areas of engineering that don't have them (improving the manufacturing process to make toothbrushes cheaper).  I'm using it in the statistical general sense, sort of like ""Men are taller than women.""  More software gets written for business apps than anything else, and the strict safety requirements aren't there.",1204898105

131183,comment,131146,131146,0,0,delackner,,,"This reminds me a lot of the coverage of the Wii before its release.  Some people don't seem to grasp the huge difference between what Apple (and Nintendo with the Wii) have done compared to previous mobile platforms.  We are looking at a first of its kind device that has the potential to wildly grow the smart phone market to be the mainstream of phone users, plus a big chunk of gamers, plus... the appeal is just so huge.",1204897723

131181,comment,128447,129183,0,0,tphyahoo,,,"You're right in a way, at least regarding education.<p>If you're very poor, but smart, america probably offers more opportunities than most euro places. Elite Unis heavily subsidize in this case.<p>The more common case though, is somewhat poor (single mom, 3 siblings, $40,000 a year), and somewhat smart but not national merit level. Many people in this situation seem to wind up getting aid packages with low interest, but huge principal, managing to get their degree but graduating with a lot of debt. This may be changing with even the shift to free tuition by some elite unis, but haven't seen really big changes yet.<p>In your last sentence, you seem to make the same point, only for med care rather than education.<p>So perhaps we agree that the american system is harshest on people who are poor but not ""poverty level.""<p>That is a bad way to be though. Because what happens when you are poverety level, and work your ass off to get up to the ""just poor"" level? You lose all that subsidy! And back to poverty level, for many.",1204897598

131176,comment,130685,130685,0,0,sanj,,,"Back in the day, when I was working on handhelds, icons were always defined in some nasty bit-fiddly binary format.  Masking was similar hard.<p>I ended up building (?) an Excel spreadsheet to do it for me.  In some ways, it was almost the inverse of the technique in the link:<p>- one set of cells was used to ""draw"" the icon by filling them with ""X""s<p>- another set of cells would glue together the values specified by each X into appropriate 32-bit integer values<p>- a final set (the coup de grace!) would grab those ints and bit twiddle them directly into a short line of legitimate c code, ready to be copied into a header file",1204896944

Really, how can an ""IT consultant specializing in Unix and related technologies"" be so clueless about cryptography?<p>He has ""long thought that [symmetric ciphers] can be bypassed using the same approach [as was used 2000 years ago]""?  RSA is ""self limiting"" because of errors in messages?  This is the sort of gibberish for which the phrase ""not even wrong"" was invented.",1204896644

457899,comment,457752,457752,0,0,edgeztv,,,"Interesting fact about TMs - while their computibility is equivalent to computers, the Big-O time for common algorithms is (possibly much) slower. Many O(n) tasks on computers with RAM are O(n^2) on a TM. The only commonality with computers in terms of time complexity is the Polynomial vs. Non-polynomial boundary.<p>The same is true for any model of computation.<p>Despite this equivalence, it's orders of magnitude harder to program a TM than the ugliest assembly language you've ever seen. This is one architecture that desperately needs a compiler :)",1233305991

1. Hit <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/full_list/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/full_...</a> 
2. Randomly pick a company from the list... for instance: Pick Paychex Systems... company 921 on Fortunes list...On their career site they list 137 current job openings... 
3. Add that to your total... 
4. Repeat until you have a representative sample.
5. Extrapolate to 1000...<p>Question: Using an appropriate random number generation between 1 and 1000, what is the sample size required to then estimate the total job openings on the 1000 sites?",1233305621

Maybe I'm right, if $publication is saying it!""<p>But then I read the article, and it's always some sob story about average folks who went to college in a liberal arts field while making absolutely no attempts at establishing an independent career in the field or working outside of class on their trade.

It's very difficult to survive and perform well in a PhD program (and subsequently in an academic career) if you aren't mentored in person by a top notch faculty that works in your area of interest.

The one thing that gets some people is that CS is taught from a very mathematical bend - about a third of the CS classes don't require any significant work on a computer (besides typesetting the problem sets in TeX). I actually prefer it that way - I'd rather focus on theory in class, I can pick up the idiosyncrasies of the tools and languages on my own time.<p>I understand that Harvard's Math department is pretty impressive too (near the same level as MIT/Princeton/etc).",1233304249

457871,comment,457499,457850,0,0,RK,,,"The US has different levels of degrees.  Most of the colleges and universities that you hear about offer bachelors degrees as the first degree (generally a four year degree).  Other colleges, especially so-called community and junior colleges will offer 2 year associates degrees in more vocational subjects such as nursing.  And then there are other purely vocational schools that offer training that lasts less than a year (usually for-profit schools).<p>One of the biggest differences between the US and German system is that almost all American students attend the same type of high school, which theoretically should prepare you to go to a university and the curricula are usually general.  Also it's important to know that the US system is mostly controlled on the local level, rather than the federal level for public schools, so a school in one city can be very different than a school in another city or state.",1233303373

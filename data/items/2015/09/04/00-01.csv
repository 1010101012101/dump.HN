The two problems you&#x27;ll have applying something like this to games are 1- the bandwidth of this RNG is much slower than your laptop CPU. It&#x27;d pair very well with a game running on the Arduino you build the RNG with though. :) 2- I&#x27;ve done a <i>lot</i> of game programming, and came to the conclusion that I almost never wanted a random number stream. They cause repeats way too frequently. Every time I want &quot;random&quot; behavior in a game nowadays, I generally either pre-generate a set of behaviors randomly and then shuffle them (guaranteeing you see each behavior once before any repeats) or use an even uniform sampling in a cycle. It was a little surprising at first, but I definitely have a better appreciation now for why game mechanics with some repetition (or maybe &quot;predictability&quot; is a better word) are more fun than true technically &#x27;random&#x27;.",1441328330

Doesn&#x27;t take much to get up and running with it, it&#x27;s pretty straightforward to use once you&#x27;re set up, it takes out-of-source builds seriously, and it&#x27;s got fair support for adding custom build tools (something you&#x27;ll have a devil of a time getting working nicely in Visual Studio). Reasonable ecosystem as well, with a good supply of online examples and drop-in helper scripts for locating common libraries. (Compare and contrast to, e.g., MSBuild, boost jam, or JamPlus - all of which, even MSBuild, might as well by comparison have about 0 users each.)<p>Not to say that it isn&#x27;t awful in many respects, though. It often feels as if it has been designed by 3 people, none of whom talk to one another, and all of whom have different ideas about how things should work. For every time there&#x27;s some easy setting that nicely handles every platform for you there&#x27;s another where you have to carefully distinguish between VC++/gcc/clang/etc. and add compiler-specific flags to some random string. And the scripting &quot;language&quot; is unhinged.<p>Still - compared to a normal project that targets N platforms, where you might well have to deal with N build systems, all appalling, if you use cmake, you&#x27;ll only have to deal with one.",1441327649

By doing this you (or someone else) can start a new Terminal based on that snapshot, and everything will be running as in the original Terminal.\n- You can also create GPU Terminal instances, with CUDA support.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing a couple differentiators at least, but I think that describes the service quite well.<p>About the price, it&#x27;s quite competitive and even better if you keep in mind that you can pause your Terminals when you don&#x27;t need them running 24x7.",1441327296

Many of the explanations claim that counter-steering is only done temporarily to begin a lean, only for &quot;setting up&quot; a turn, and then switches to normal steering. After a lot of experimentation, I&#x27;m pretty convinced counter-steering is actually always happening on a bike, but relative to the turning radius of your lean, not relative to straight, which makes it a little subtle and harder to demonstrate.

I could understand this decision if your products were serviced-based or hosted (i.e. cloud) solutions, but as a stand-alone, desktop software this decision only serves to benefit one party.<p>Not only are you questioning historically loyal users by continuously asking them to show their support for your product, you are literally devaluing your product by requiring me to repurchase it on a recurring basis. No longer do I have the option to purchase a high-value, life long, perpetual license for your product. I do not understand how Jetbrains can drag themselves to the ranks of often, lackluster subscription based software.<p>I have long been a loyal and vocal advocate for Jetbrains software and customer service. Your software does make my job easier and I do enjoy using it. Your customer support and involvement with your loyal community has long been top notch. I often go out of my way to explain why I love using your products, like Webstorm and PHPStorm, and have convinced many people to switch to Jetbrains. After this decision, I have no desire to continue advocating your historically incredible software and intend to make it very clear to potential users of how you’ve decided to treat loyal users.<p>This decision shows a lack of empathy for the community you have worked so hard to build and I am extremely concerned about your future considerations of myself and the rest of the community. Unless Jetbrains decides to amend this new policy with consideration for traditional, perpetual based licenses, I will no longer be purchasing new offerings. I will use the current version of software. When I feel they are no longer suitable for use, I will look for alternatives offering perpetual licenses or simply use a text editor.<p>Again, your software does make my job easier and I do enjoy using it, but I want to make it clear that I do not need to you your software. There are plenty of acceptable alternative IDE&#x27;s and, of course, I can always use a standard text editor.<p>I hope Jetbrains can recognize the error of their ways and address this issue in response to the community. I want to continue enjoying your products and advocating for a historically incredible brand.<p>Sincerely,<p>{Your Name}",1441327013

This statement is true, but just noting that you don&#x27;t have to use both sides.<p>* When using Meteor in the backend, you also need to use it in your frontend app. Telepat lets you use any frontend framework.<p>- You don&#x27;t have to use it with just Meteor&#x27;s front end (which is I think what you meant). It has integrations with other front end frameworks and you could use it with just about any front end framework as long as you add some boilerplate to communicate with the client-side store and DDP.<p>* Meteor is a solution for creating webapps, and running on mobile devices works only via webviews. Telepat enables native clients and native functionality for mobile or embedded.<p>- Not true actually. They make it the easiest to get mobile apps out with Cordova and webviews, but there are various libraries out there like the ObjectiveC-DDP or meteor-ios library that integrates natively with iOS applications.<p>* Telepat allows using adapters for 3rd party databases, messaging queues and push transports.<p>- You can do this with Meteor as well and integrate NPM packages.<p>I hope that helps shed some light on the comparison.<p>The platform looks great though.

At the time, Intel was likely already developing a 64-bit extension of x86.<p>On the other hand, I think the 16 to 32-bit extension (with the 386) was done quite well. 16 and 32-bit code can coexist, and it&#x27;s even possible to use the 32-bit registers in 16-bit mode; not so with AMD64. It&#x27;s not too difficult to figure out how to add 64-bit support in a more non-disruptive way, without having to do silly things like removing instructions and features that they had to reintroduce later [1][2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pagetable.com/?p=25"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pagetable.com/?p=25</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Differences_between_AMD64_and_Intel_64"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Differences_between_AMD...</a>",1441324970

Yes, content should work without JavaScript where possible, but at the same time, comments about it really don&#x27;t need to show up on unrelated articles.  In this case, the site in question is constructed entirely client-side using JavaScript.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of that approach, but complaining about it <i>here</i> (as opposed to with the site in question) is not helpful.  The same comment could appear attached to any number of articles posted here, and it&#x27;d be equally content-free there.",1441324916

And I've seen a fair bit of Ruby.<p>And in my experience, you're simply wrong; aside from toy programs written for golfing or obfuscation contests, there really doesn't seem to be a significant difference, and many of the ""concise"" features of, say, Perl tend to be frowned on for real-world use because of the impact they have on the ability of others to read, understand and maintain the code.<p>As for Lisp, well, ""concise"" Lisp programs tend to remind me of stuff that comes out of the demoscene, where the headline is ""look at this awesome demo in 4k!"" but it actually relies on hundreds of megabytes' worth of graphics APIs. Lisp seems to be the same way: for every short piece of amazing Lisp code, there seems to be a corresponding huge chunk of functions and macros backing it.",1249707590

The exception is when using a keyboard macro to do something to a bunch of lines. It's common for such macros to have a form like<p>1) start at the beginning of the line
2) do stuff to the line
3) go to the beginning of the next line<p>When the navigation commands take line wrap into effect, you can wind up with a macro that gets run once on short lines, but twice on long lines.",1249706872

A 14-foot laptop would be twelve times the size of a 14-foot one, so it would presumably weigh about twelve times as much.

There's some random gibberish appended to the plaintext (""hey, this needs some salt""), but they're not padding a damn thing. Bleichenbacher's chosen-ciphertext attack; game over.<p>The RSA decryption, server-side, isn't blinded at all. Timing attack free-for-all there. Boneh's timing attack might work, as long as you can pin the session down. (And since this is for folks who don't get SSL, I'm sure you could.)<p>And key generation is equally horrible. The lack of a real CSPRNG was pointed out by someone else. They're also not protecting against Fermat factorization: when they generate p and q they only check equality and primality, not distance. Same with small decryption exponents. Unlikely to be serious, but it sure doesn't speak to their skills as cryptographic implementers.<p>Jesus H. Christ. What a train wreck.",1249704222

35919,comment,35787,35787,0,0,nostrademons,,,"A bunch of quotes in this article stuck out at me, but this one in particular:<p>""How can you possibly have the emotional investment necessary to see things through to profitability, through highs, lows and everything in between, if you haven't fought tooth and nail to get there?""<p>Is this really true, when you take into account startups that fight tooth and nail and <i>still</i> don't succeed?  Is it better to start with the confidence, money, and connections of other people and then ride the wave of their support, or is it better to start with <i>nothing</i> other than your own belief in yourself and then fight tooth and nail until you get the confidence, money, and connections of others?<p>My boss is trying to convince me that I should at least have an offer of cash in hand from an angel investor before leaving my day job, even if I choose not to take it.  While this is quite self-serving (he doesn't want me to leave), it also sounds pretty rational.  I mean, right now I have fairly little validation other than my cofounder's confidence, my desire to use our own product, and my belief that I have the technical chops to get to the point where we can.<p>The article suggests that it's probably better <i>not</i> to have that external validation, and <i>definitely</i> better not to take the money.  Is that character-building, or foolhardy?",1185077221

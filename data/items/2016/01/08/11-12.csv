If they had announced an open platform with open specs for implementing low-bandwidth video,&quot;<p>Every streaming platform since RealVideo \nin the mid 90s has had a way to detect bandwidth and send low bandwidth video based on the amount of bandwidth available.  You can download a free streaming server right now from either Apple or Adobe that can do it.<p>&quot;and then said &quot;if you have this, we&#x27;ll use it&quot;, the end result would be that everyone could benefit from an innovation of theirs.&quot;<p>Does he really need to provide a link to Apple&#x27;s or Adobe&#x27;s free offering or the $600 WireCast solution? I&#x27;ve set up an bandwidth adaptive streaming solution for around $2000 (Mac Mini + BlackMagic Intensity + camcorder).<p>&quot;He&#x27;s smart enough to know that favoring companies that &quot;have the technology to do this&quot; really means favoring large corporations, which is bad for the little guys.&quot;<p>This &quot;technology&quot; to stream lower bitrate video based on available bit rate has been around for 20 years.",1452254394

The only times those should be used under the child porn label is when they are used in collections having nothing to do with the original people involved.<p>I have three kids, one older, two younger. There is <i>no way</i> that I&#x27;d let a picture of the younger ones without any clothes on get out of my control (the older one is old enough to be his own master now), and I&#x27;m extremely protective of what happens with pictures that contain them at all. My main reason for being that careful is that the internet has a habit of destroying data that you&#x27;d like to have but it will preserve for ever data that you&#x27;d like to go away.",1452254371
10864267,comment,10863990,10863990,0,0,arnvald,,,"Very short reviews of the places on the list that I&#x27;ve already seen:<p>* Brno, Czech Republic - I stayed there just a few days, but even though pretty, the city wasn&#x27;t very exciting. It&#x27;s quite cheap and less touristic than Prague, so if you&#x27;re looking for something less crowded than the capital, it might be a good choice to experience Czech culture<p>* Barcelona, Spain - one of the most touristic places in Europe, but it totally deserves it. It&#x27;s not only beautiful and lively, but even if you want to avoid crowded areas, you can book a room a few stations from the center and enjoy the fantastic local culture. I stayed there for a month and as long as you stay away from La Rambla, it&#x27;s very relaxing place<p>* Vietnam - I haven&#x27;t been to Dalat yet, but recently I&#x27;ve visited Ho Chi Minh City and Mui Ne and both are wonderful places. Vietnamese cuisine and coffee, as well as cheerful and very friendly people, make it a perfect place for a low-cost trip.<p>* Malaga, Spain - way different from Barcelona, with the influence of African culture, it&#x27;s a good place to spend a few days, but also perfect base for short trips around - from Malaga you can easily get to Gibraltar, Granada, Jerez and Seville<p>* Phnom Penh, Cambodia - I think that other places in Cambodia like Battambang or Siem Reap are better to visit. Capital of the country is rather crowded and polluted. There&#x27;s plenty of things to see, however, especially if you know a bit about history of Cambodia, you can constantly feel demons of the past being present in the city.<p>* Sydney, Australia - I spent 1 week in Melbourne and then 1 week in Sydney, when I was in Australia. I must say I strongly prefer Melbourne as it is more a place to live, while Sydney seems more a business city. Having said that, I highly recommend to visit them both, they&#x27;re expensive, but wonderful.",1452254355

EPA isn&#x27;t constrained because of well placed campaign donations. It&#x27;s constrained because a huge part of the country believes that God literally gave us the earth to use up and considers any environmental regulation to be unamerican. Not to mention that every attempt at regulation is met with the same response: &quot;it&#x27;ll kill jobs.&quot;<p>Do big chemical companies have lots of lobbyists? Sure. Their job is to point out to Congresscritters every bit of uncertainty in the science (of which there is a lot), to reinforce what they already believed. Those companies don&#x27;t need to make big donations to get their way--they just have to tell Congresspeople how many good blue collar factory jobs they create in their district.

Please reread it with that in mind.<p>Everything you&#x27;ve said about child porn is only about violent child porn and other kinds of child abuse. I completely agree with you on that. What I&#x27;m concerned with is harmless child porn which people still demonize too. For example when a parent&#x27;s innocent bath video gets leaked to a child porn ring. That does&#x27;t transform it from OK to bad. It makes no difference to the child.

If that&#x27;s the case, buyers will rationally flee black areas for the sake of property value. Black affluent buyers will flee to white areas for the same reasons, but if they are a minority they can&#x27;t balance out. So depending on the correlation of home ownership with wealth (strong in the US), you get a vicious circle where black areas get blacker and their initial majority black residents become trapped there due to declining property values, with the banking and commercial sector entrenching the segregation due to risk aversion.<p>So once initiated, ethnic polarization is self sustaining even if the initial instigators (racism) become largely irrelevant.

But the line gets drawn where children get abused and that&#x27;s why possession of child pornography (and not being of a paedophillic disposition) is a crime.<p>> It used to be gays but now they&#x27;re off limits, so pedophiles are about all they have left to hate.<p>That&#x27;s an insanely dumb line. Gays are &#x27;off limits&#x27; because just like pedophiles they are <i>people</i> first. You don&#x27;t get to bash gay people for their sexuality (or your own insecurities) any more than you get to bash pedophiles. That&#x27;s not the point. The pedophiles that get bashed are the ones that act on their urges in such a way that they endanger the people that we happen to cherish most, our (collective) children and their behavior in such situations makes use of the power asymmetry between adults and children (who are all but defenseless).<p>In that sense the outrage is no less than if a big adult guy would rape a slightly built woman. (Or at least, I would expect it to be no less, it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be less for me.)<p>> Maybe that combined with a bit of &quot;think of the children!&quot;.<p>No, we just don&#x27;t expect the children to stand up for themselves. They&#x27;re physically weak (in the case of child pornography there does not seem to be a lower limit on what gets people excited, it goes all the way to newborns...), they are small, they generally defer to the authority of the adults present and they end up scarred for life from these ordeals.<p>> There&#x27;s also widespread hatred toward incest but it doesn&#x27;t seem so severe, perhaps because when it&#x27;s adults, only the former emotion applies, not the latter.<p>Incest is taboo in many cultures. There are several reasons for that (most of them good, some of them debatable) but the definition of incest is probably not what you think it is (it can involve consent and it may involve only adults). Incest is more about bloodlines than anything else.",1452252019

2957605,comment,2957522,2957522,8,0,fredleblanc,,,"I felt like this with my code for the first 5 years that I was coding as well. My code now isn't pristine or perfect, but I'm consistently satisfied with the quality of my final products. Here's what I did to get to the point where I'm happy with my code:<p>1. Debug and refactor. Early on, I'd stumble through creating a script. It was usually write three lines, see if that worked, repeat. I didn't plan ahead enough, and by the end, my code was just layers of ideas tightly held together by a file name. This aggravated me, so after I'd get my scripts working, I'd completely rewrite them from scratch, making improvements where I saw them, simplifying code wherever I could.<p>I've learned more debugging (generally my own) code than I have from any book or teacher.<p>This was a lot of time spent, but eventually I could start seeing ahead and could make those changes in real-time as I was writing them. I'm not saying that I don't go back and refactor my code now, but when I do it's usually to fix things for speed or bugs, not for code cleanliness.<p>2. Plan ahead. I know some people that write out the entire shell of their program -- all of the functions and names and comments of what each function will do -- before ever writing the actual logic. I never had the patience for that, but you can still plan ahead.<p>Take a look at what you're trying to accomplish, and find the areas where you know you don't know what you're doing. Do a bit of research on those points. See what others have done, there's a really good chance you're not the first person to do those things. If you're still not sure, ask for help. The community is almost always willing to help.<p>3. Clarity over cleverness, always. I always take the road that will be more easily maintainable in the long run rather than the code that will work the fastest. (But, you know, if you can hit both at once, awesome.) I like breaking things down into simple bits. All of my functions are either only accomplishing one task, or are strings to those one-task functions put together to do something complex (but is still considered one task).<p>4. Learn, practice, learn, practice, repeat. Don't just stick with one language, branch out and see how other languages tackle similar problems. Take a look at code that you thin is better than yours and figure out why you think that. Take a look at code that's worse than yours and figure out why you think <i>that</i>. Write those things down and keep a list next to your monitor. Review them each time you sit down. Put them into practice. A lot.<p>5. Perspective. Take a look at your own work from 2-3 years ago and look at how far you've come. You've probably covered more distance than you think. Even if you're not 100% happy with where you're at, the progress will be reassuring.<p>6. Finally, stop worrying about it. Think of some people that are really good at what they do: professional athletes, professional plumbers, professional anything. When they're in the clutch moments, they're not stressing about how what they're doing looks, they're in ""the zone,"" their mind lets go and instincts take over. Programmers develop those instincts too.<p>You're probably much better than you think, and you're only going to get better every time you program. :)",1315069171

2957600,story,,,1,0,throwaway8478,"Ask HN: How do you fairly compensate foreign employees?",,"My startup is currently at a stage where we can afford to hire an employee at below-market wages. We are a US company, but the employee we'd like to hire is located outside the US.<p>If we hired a US employee, we'd simply make up the difference with equity. This aligns the employee's incentives with ours (we all want to make the equity worth more), and this seems to be the valley standard.<p>However, for a non-citizen, equity is tricky business. Equity is basically a package of rights, enforceable via US courts, and it would be difficult for a foreign national to use US courts to enforce their rights. (For this reason, I'd be very leery of accepting equity in a non-US corporation.)<p>Another possibility we've considered is a pay package that pays out when we get funding. E.g., after funding, we pay back salary + above market wages. This behaves similarly to equity (i.e., low pay up front, more if business succeeds).<p>From our perspective, either solution (or some linear combination of the two) would be excellent.<p>Does anyone have suggestions on how to fairly compensate employees in similar situations?",1315069084

Groupon uses Gross Revenue Treatment, not net revenue (as eBay does).<p>They include in their revenue the total price of the offering, but they only actually see half of that price. For example, if the coupon is sold for $20, Groupon only actually see $10 of it and they should be accounting their revenue using the $10, not the $20.<p>Imagine how much revenue eBay would have if they counted the total cost of the auction and not just the portion they actually receive?<p>>Groupon accounts for its revenue differently than say eBay, and in a way that some say is misleading to potential investors. The company defines revenue as “the purchase price paid by customers.” Then there’s the issue of “the cost of revenue,” leaving the company with what it calls “gross profit,” which is “the amount of revenue we retain after paying an agreed upon percentage of the purchase price to the featured merchant.”\nHere’s the thing: Many companies like eBay [...], which also take a fee for transactions, would consider that “gross profit” number a “net revenue number.” UCLA Anderson School’s accounting lecturer Gordon Klein says the S-1 uses terms in a way he’s never used them before, and this unusual accounting tells him that investors should “run from the stock.” : <a href=""http://goingconcern.com/2011/06/theres-some-fuss-about-groupons-revenue-or-profits-or-something/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goingconcern.com/2011/06/theres-some-fuss-about-group...</a><p>Also, the fact that Groupon delays paying their merchants is what allows them to have an operating cash-flow as they even say in their S-1 filing:\nOur merchant payment terms and revenue growth have provided us with operating cash flow to fund our working capital needs. Our merchant arrangements are generally structured such that we collect cash up front when our customers purchase Groupons and make payments to our merchants at a subsequent date.<p>>The second issue is that  the accumulation of the merchant payable, has resulted in a substantial working capital deficit.  Essentially, despite being cash flow positive in the short term, they are not generating enough to cover their operating expenses like the amounts owing to merchants, salaries, rent and other costs of running of the business.  As such, without additional financing, they will not be able to meet their obligations.

2957519,comment,2956268,2957482,8,0,nikcub,,,"My experience is from 10 years ago, where I set this up for a startup I worked at. This was the situation: we had built a platform for trade finance. It was like eBay but for trade paper. eg. somebody is exporting $80M worth of oil, and they need a bank to finance it. We had 500+ banks from around the world on the platform, and they would all bid for the business.<p>Because we were dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of commitments, we needed a certificate architecture that would verify the seller, the buyer, and for each of those parties to verify the site.<p>I went to Verisign and asked them for the best solution, and this is what they setup:<p>- we had a Verisign terminal setup in the office. This was a normal computer, but locked down to only run Verisign software. It was a flavor of UNIX<p>- the terminal had a smart-card reader on it, and a private net connection that went only back to Verisign.<p>- the authentication to login to the computer was two passwords, both with secure tokens, and two smart cards<p>- when you login, you do the ID shuffle, which involved two people who had background checks conducted on them etc.<p>- we generate a certificate, which is then signed using a sub-CA certificate that Verisign issues to us<p>- Our certificate thus acted as a CA, but it was authorized by Verisign, so the certs that we signed would then check out using the built-in browser CA certs<p>This cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars to setup, and cost us hundreds of dollars for each cert we signed. When I did the due dilligence on the solution, I visited 3 london-based banks who had implemented the same system. The selling point was that we could act as a CA, but without really being a CA.<p>Verisign's sales pitch was that you could never become the root CA because of the stringent policies that had to be put in place (isolated networks, key generation, etc.), but for the fraction of the cost, we could sign certs using our cert which would be verified up the chain to the root CA which was Verisign<p>I can't stress how secure this whole procedure was. The root CA store was the holy grail - nobody that did't have the infrastructure or procedures like Verisign would get anywhere near it. I now read stories 10 years later of dodgy dutch companies with no budgets being given root CA privileges, and I am just blown away.<p>If these guys needed a solution to sign certs, they should have been setup with what we had, and what the other banks had, not just given placement in the root cert store. Verisign would check and double-check everything we did, and would frequently revert certs we signed where they suspected something was wrong.<p>With this story it seems there was a completely amateur operation given privileges to sign certs as part of a root CA.<p>I have 163 root CA certs on my OS X machine. 10 years ago I am certain the number was 4 or 5<p>note: this was so long ago that I probably have some of my terminology mixed up, but what we bought was the right to sign certs as a sub-CA of Verisign, a privileged root CA. I also got a very cool tour of Verisign which is another story.",1315066303

The point is: Fraud is always a course of action available to the SEC, FTC and AGs.",1315065956

The laws still apply. The cops knew that they had absolutely no evidence or reason to search his house; which is why they wisely stayed outside. But they also knew that they had created a false impression that the Apple goons were also SFPD, which allowed them to enter the guy's house.<p>As far as the value is concerned: so what? If I put a value of $1000000 on my Bic pen, does that mean I'm allowed to break the laws in finding out who took it?? If it really was that valuable, then what the heck was an Apple employee doing with it getting drunk in a sleazy bar? Will the Apple employee be docked $100,000 from his paycheck if the phone is not found? Get real!",1315065843

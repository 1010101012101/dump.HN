Wait until you deploy your app and that table now has 4,000,000 rows in it.. then you have a problem.<p>In MongoDB (and maybe others too) there exists an option to fail when doing a table scan so that you know immediately while developing that there exists a potential for things to go awry at some later point.  You can fix that now by either re-thinking your data structure, re-thinking your query, or adding appropriate indexes.<p>MySQL's slow query log is good for reactive development instead of proactive development.<p>I think its an indispensable feature.",1305309497

The value of an undergraduate degree is diminishing by the day, which is further exacerbated by the skyrocketing cost of education.

The current system of trying to get every high schooler into college is asinine, not everyone is cut out for it. It seems to me that students, parents, teachers, and guidance counselors should work better together to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a given individual to determine what that student finds most interesting, and foster that feeling.

2545439,comment,2544516,2544594,19,0,tzs,,,"> And even if it weren't, Apple has the legal manpower and the money vault to lawyer them into the ground.<p>In some areas of litigation, it might be possible for one side to draw out the case, and to do other things that raise the cost, so that it is possible to force the other side to abandon their case due to budget constraints.<p>Generally, patent infringement litigation is not one of those areas. A patent infringement case can be expensive for the plaintiff but the costs are reasonably predictable, and a pretty good upper bound can be estimated going in.<p>There are large, experienced, patent litigation firms that will take cases like this on contingency. They have more than enough set aside for these kinds of cases to cover anything that defendant can do to run up costs.<p>As far as legal manpower goes, Apple would have to hire an outside firm. Yes, like all large companies Apple has a good and competent legal staff, including IP lawyers. However, they won't have the experience of those at outside firms that specialize in IP litigation. When it comes to legal manpower, the case would come down to lawyers from a top IP firm working for plaintiff (probably on contingency) vs. lawyers from a top IP firm working for defendant (getting paid by the hour).<p>You can see a series of examples of this if you look at patent suits against Microsoft. Microsoft often uses Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which is one of the top law firms in the world. Plaintiffs against Microsoft are often represented by McKool Smith which is one of the top 3 or 4 patent litigation firms in the US. The net result here is that it doesn't matter how big Apple is compared to the patent owner, they are not going to out manpower them--both are likely to be represented by top 10 IP firms of about equal power.",1305308211

To connect this with your original comment, burning coal <i>is</i> like smoking cigarettes.  1 certainly will not kill you, but the aggregate effects of many plants (China was building 1/week at some point!) over many years is the real problem.<p>The biggest advantage of nuclear that I see is that it mostly concentrates and contains the waste.

Personally, I prefer RSS over this because I can control specifically the sources that I'm interested in. TextChannels seems to allow a custom channel to be created, but why would I do this and <i>hope</i> that the social filter is applied the way I want.

Expecting everyone to make their own pencils is silly.<p>You don't get more and better food by becoming a better farmer, you get some other guy to be better at farming, and some other guy to be better at making farming equipment, and some other to be better at making software that runs the equipment, and some other guy to be better at making the satellite that gives weather data to the software, and so on and so forth.<p>Yes, we need people in skilled trades. It might even be a good idea to start retraining idle workers in skilled trades. But specialization isn't just for ants.

It's potentially a revolutionary way to establish context with users, but you have to be ready to engage fully or it can do more harm than good.",1305306306

I am sure there is more to skype deal than just the GUI app. The deal may have brought rights for usage of certain IP networks or something along those lines.<p>I am not sure how MSFT is planning to leverage this deal with plans of pushing into the mobile market.

First, the ability to simultaneously carry on discussion on multiple topics all at once is a huge factor. In a normal, face to face conversation following an interesting but unrelated line of thought can sidetrack the entire conversation, often beyond the point of recovery. When you move to a textual medium you can easily carry on two or even three topics provided that both sides can keep track of the various conversation contexts all at once. Best of all, you can follow up on these branches in conversation even while the other person is typing.<p>That brings me to the second huge benefit. When talking, you will very rarely speak at the same time as another person. Not only is it rude in basically all cultures I am familiar with, it also makes it hard to follow what either person is saying. With text there are no such limitations. When you consider that an average person can read up to 300 WPM, while someone that has practiced speed reading can easily break 600, it is not too infeasible that both sides of a conversation may be typing the vast majority of the time. For those well practiced in text-based communication this can greatly increase the average amount of information transfered per unit time, easily negating the difference in typing vs speaking speeds, and possibly even improving upon it.<p>I do agree on your notes about body language and emotions. I have lost count of the number of times I have seem people interpret sarcastic textual statements to be completely serious. On the other hand I find that people get better at recognizing even that when spending enough time reading chat/comments online.",1305306137

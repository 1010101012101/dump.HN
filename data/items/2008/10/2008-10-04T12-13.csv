Everything else is secondary.<p>I don't understand when people complain that ""XY release sucks because they included the wrong BitTorrent client"". I've read serious reviewers stating this.<p>They need to become discriminate about what they include in their releases, to curate their art, as Jason Fried would say.",1223124377

I don't recall when I started to think they might be serious, but it might been when I saw their page ""How dumb are we?"", and they were defending their position...<p>It's true that it would have been more diplomatic to conceal my reaction.<p>Also, I searched around for a reference to the Douglas Adams passage, but couldn't find it (I couldn't find my copy at home - all my books are in boxes). I'm pretty sure it's near the start of ""Mostly Harmless"", as a product of the ""Infinidim"" corporation, and something to do with a multi-dimensional bird... I would like you to see it, because then I think then you'd have a clear sense of my point of view (independent of your dis/agreement with it)<p>Incidentally, labeling a comment as ""childish"" and ""inflammatory"" provides little information about the subject, and more about the emotional state of the labeler (I am sorry to have upset you). Giving the reasons for that emotional state are often a more compelling refutation - that is, if you can see the reasons (I find that very hard myself).",1223124079

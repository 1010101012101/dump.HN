315845,comment,315281,315281,0,0,railsjedi,,,"Good looking app. Stands out as distinct and memorable.<p>The name is a bit obscure and hard to remember. Might hurt word of mouth (which could be a big deal on campuses).<p>I'd recommend getting rid of the adwords. Highly doubtful that they'll make you much money, and its a big distraction.<p>An alternative monetization approach would be to search for keywords on peoples pages and have a sidebar that recommends books (on amazon affiliates) based on the keywords on their notebooks. Call it a book recommender. Fairly easy to parse out keywords and query recommendation on amazon, and you could even run this as a cron job nightly. Here's a good libary: <a href=""http://www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-aws/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-aws/</a><p>Nice move focusing on email, sms, and facebook integration. This is the key features that will keep people using your app. More than any fancy html management interface. May be worth looking at iPhone/mobile interface and meebo support for chatting with partners.<p>Just a few random thoughts. Hope they are helpful.",1222415158

They really do consistently act like ass-clowns.<p>They do seem to have the second most well-attended demo days though. I don't know about how their connections compare to the others on that list. That might be the deciding factor for me.",1222414519

I would like to be able to add a course, and not have to navigate back to Home to be able to add a new assignment. I think it would just really clarify things a bit better.",1222414478

315835,comment,315787,315787,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"Strange list.  Some great stuff on there, but if I were going to attempt to substitute for an undergrad CS degree, I'd definitely have SICP on a list ahead of APL, for example.<p>Of course, the whole topic is quite silly; if you really wanted to substitute for a CS degree, the easiest way to do it would be to examine (for example) the MIT course catalog, put together the appropriate course plan, and then order the textbooks used by those courses.  And, with the video lectures and lecture notes showing up on OCW, you would actually be approximating (in a loose sense) the experience, provided one actually does the coursework and exams.",1222413191

315833,comment,315796,315817,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, it lends credibility, but it's not necessarily the primary purpose...at least not of YC.  There are a lot of good benefits to YC...it's an educational experience, a community-building experience, and more.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that dropping the YC bomb in a discussion with an investor is an automatic upgrade to ""vetted"" in the investors mind (works with valley press, as well, apparently).",1222413056

315828,comment,315796,315818,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Really?  I don't think I understand how this follows.<p>Alternatives to YC <i>include</i> Sequoia, angels, other VCs, etc. and not just YC clones.  It's an expensive source of money, and if the company isn't delivering a lot of extra value (which YC has consistently been shown to do, and none of the others, with the <i>possible</i> exception of TechStars, has shown that) it's probably a bad deal.<p>And, as for ""would you go to a VC instead of Sequoia""...yes, but I wouldn't go to a VC that I have no knowledge of, and that has no track record.  I'd accept money from a top ten VC (assuming reasonable terms and consonance of vision), but I'd rather build a company on its own revenues than take money from an investor I don't believe in, or I don't believe is capable of grokking our long term vision for the company.",1222412694

315823,comment,315796,315796,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"TechStars, as bizarrely and counter-productively obsessed with YC as they seem to be, has actually produced a couple of winners now.  It's not the kind of hit rate that YC has exhibited...or had exhibited at this stage in YC's life.  But it, at least, has some measurable success.<p>Given that there are cheaper sources of funding, and most of them have no track record and extremely limited credibility, I would look much deeper...and consider other alternatives.  Charles River has an early stage arm that does a lot of deals, for example, and has a good reputation.  Angels are another option.  While this ""new model"" of investing is compelling for its high success rate, when executed by YC, it's not necessarily the best way to raise money.  We took money from YC and have never had any regrets about it...but I can't think of <i>any</i> other situation where we'd give up that much equity for that little money.  But, you'd have to decide that for yourself.",1222412426

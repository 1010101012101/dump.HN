Did I miss something?<p>--edit--<p>So I watched the video, and it looks like this is a pretty awesome toolbar. The features are pretty cool. The site/copy is cheesy, though.<p>My comment about RescueTime and the closeness of their businesses still stands though-- I have a feeling this would be fairly easy for RescueTime to implement.",1203065648

We can only imagine the world today if such developments had succeeded.<p>Likewise, the computer industry in the 1980s had some promising developments in massively parallel computing. This included wafer scale integration and parallel processor microkernels. In 1987, Sir Clive Sinclair was granted a patent for creating massively parallel, fault tolerant computing. Rather than making a wafer of chips then packaging and testing each unit, it is possible for processors to self-test and self-assemble into a working network. This would allow an eight inch wafer to be packaged with minimal additional steps. Furthermore, this would have been an asyncronous processor design. Microkernels, such as HeliOS could have been adapted to run on such hardware and the user level programs may not have required any changes. You may also wish to research the Meiko Computing Surface which used Inmos Transputers or the Connexion Machine. Unfortunately, none of these developments were compatible with Windows.<p>Finally, if you enjoy alternative history, you'd probably enjoy The Gernsback Continuum from William Gibson's book of short stories, Burning Chrome ( <a href=""http://project.cyberpunk.ru/lib/burning_chrome/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://project.cyberpunk.ru/lib/burning_chrome/</a> ).",1203064347

And how can ebay know, unless they test it before full-scale deployment? One option would be to apply it to new sellers at first and see how it goes.",1203063363
116369,comment,115626,116034,0,0,h34t,,,"The idea of embeddable-apps-in-a-box, or ""the widget is the platform"", seems pretty compelling to me. What are your reasons for thinking it's over-hyped?<p>I don't find the ""most widgets are trivial"" argument compelling; the large portion of the internet devoted to porn doesn't detract from the rest of it, and likewise, the uselessness of unpopular widgets doesn't detract from usefulness of popular ones.<p>I really like Google's widget advertising service that let you dive deep into content without leaving a page. For example, I watched all 6 video clips on a National Geographic widget ad for their new ""6 degrees"" show. I'd have never navigated to another page to do the same thing.<p>I think we're just at the beginning of widget up-take... but I could be wrong, and would like to hear the arguments from the other side (perhaps there good discussions of this elsewhere already?)",1203063115

Emailing photos is nice but I wouldn't name it as one of the three selling points. And I'm sure I can upload photos and I'm sure it's safe too - tell me something cool about your site I don't know.<p>And if you aim for users with a huge backlog of pictures, why don't you mention that? Can I try it out for free for a month? It's not on the front page.<p>Maybe you need marketing, but you need more work on the selling aspect of your site first.<p>Get Google Analytics.

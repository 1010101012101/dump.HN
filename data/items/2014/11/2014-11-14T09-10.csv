So there isn&#x27;t _that_ much of a liability - the main concern for companies is probably that they&#x27;ll have to stop mistreating their other employees, too.<p>OTOH, there&#x27;s a separate branch of jurisdiction especially for employment related issues which is generally employee friendly and for the employee a lawsuit is free and doesn&#x27;t require legal representation on the lowest level.",1415959197

Not &quot;interesting&quot; ideas?<p>> Even the nanoparticles are mundane and not much more of an extension of the work that&#x27;s been going on since the 90s on bio-chips for detection.<p>Using antibodies and tailored cancer treatment is still a reactive treatment. As the article states, the Google X Labs is aiming for &quot;constant monitoring&quot; of your body with these nanoparticles - hence creating a &quot;proactive&quot; ability to constantly monitor your body of potential issues. If achievable, that&#x27;s pretty remarkable.<p>> In comparison, Elon Musk seems like the true visionary.<p>Both Page and Musk are visionaries. The logic you use to criticize Page&#x27;s &quot;mundane&quot; ideas can be equally applied to Musk - serious attempts at modern electric cars have been around since the 90s [1][2], and space travel has been around since the 60s. Your logic would dictate that Musk is merely extending the work in those fields.<p>Your criticism of Page&#x27;s &quot;moon shot&quot; ideas not being world-changing/interesting greatly misses the point.<p>Page and Musk have different areas of strengths, but I don&#x27;t think you can call one of them a &quot;true visionary&quot; compared to the other.

I don&#x27;t care about how much megapixels you can cram in there - if your lens is pixel-perfect, 6 is enough for most purposes anyway. The only reason I might want to upgrade from my Canon 40D is a drastically improved dynamic range, a compacter size and the ability to shoot movies. So far it&#x27;s all not quite there yet to be worth it, from my point of view.<p>Plus, I&#x27;m having more fun developing my pictures taken with my Nikon FM2 anyway.<p>Ironically, recenty the Nokia approach with supersampling seems to have paid off most regarding low-light and dynamic range performance of phone cameras (especially dynamic range, which this article didn&#x27;t address).

In fact, I thought I made it apparent that I made no such assumptions, given that I stated both possibilities: 1) You use libraries that are powered by meta-programming (making it good for you, ergo good that it is part of the language).  2)  You don&#x27;t use libraries powered by meta-programming (doesn&#x27;t matter, a huge c++ user base do, ergo good that it is part of the language).<p>If you belong to either of 1) or 2), it doesn&#x27;t matter whether or not this feature is possible, you can choose not to use the libraries, and you can choose not to use meta-programming features.<p>Could you share an argument as to why you feel a language shouldn&#x27;t have features that you don&#x27;t have to use?<p>If you don&#x27;t use STL, boost, QT, or pretty much any C++ library I can think of... do you write everything from scratch?<p>As for when C++ is &quot;best&quot; or &quot;second-best&quot;, these kind of questions tend to lead to opinion-based arguing, rather than constructive discussion. I&#x27;m definitely not interest in the former, so I&#x27;ll just give you the general objective consensus of the programming world: C and C++ are used when performance matters. C++ allows more abstraction without a real runtime cost.<p>A good read:

8606386,comment,8595905,8601413,0,0,moonchrome,,,"I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say - core.async has no type annotations, you cant even figure out what the protocols are supposed to do because there is no documentation and no types - you literally have to find places its used and reverse engineer protocol semantics. And the function I linked to is very hard to keep track of - a large part of that is inherent with synchronization/buffering logic being complex but the language does nothing to make the code simple or easy to read - I&#x27;d bet that function would be easier to understand in Java than in Clojure.<p>I&#x27;ve tried core.typed, it&#x27;s amazing in theory but in practice it&#x27;s unusable (at least for me) and nobody annotates their code anyway. If core.typed becomes more widespread in Clojure community I might actually give it a second chance, in the mean time I&#x27;m just going to use Kotlin for JVM, it has transparent Java interop and reduces the Java noise, and the tools (IDEA) is infinitely better than anything I&#x27;ve seen in Clojure land.",1415956844

Upon seeing that sym_equal is #define&#x27;d to rb_obj_equal, it will be clear that they&#x27;re identical at the C level. It may not be obvious why it&#x27;s a #define, but a cautious programmer would be on alert that changing it back to a separate function would likely have some kind of implications.<p>Perhaps the ideal solution would be a large refactor to make the whole system as self-explanatory and surprise-free as possible.

8606384,comment,8602816,8604108,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"What stops so many other countries from building nuclear weapons?<p>That&#x27;s an interesting question, perhaps the best answer is simply affluence, the perception of geopolitical safety, and the perception of unwanted negative repercussions of obtaining nuclear weapons. Any developed country with a significant industrial base can build nuclear weapons. Trivially so for countries with significant local nuclear power industrial infrastructure such as fuel reprocessing or Uranium enrichment. Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Germany, all these countries, and more, could build nuclear weapons quite rapidly and in great quantity just by deciding to do so.<p>For everyone else, well, one hopes that it is sufficiently difficult and costly that it&#x27;s just not worth it for most countries, and difficult to hide as well, though mostly that&#x27;s a lie we tell ourselves to make us feel safe. The hardest part is acquiring the fissile materials, which turns out to be slightly tricky. Plutonium requires production in reactors, but more so it requires a rather inefficient process to produce weapons grade Plutonium in reactors. Reactors are hard to hide, and if a reactor is under IAEA observation it&#x27;s non-trivial to use the reactor to produce Plutonium. I say non-trivial but it is certainly far from impossible, as it&#x27;s been done, but it makes it difficult to produce in large quantity while under the IAEA&#x27;s eyes.<p>Uranium enrichment is a bit of a different story, and not a particularly heartening one either. It does require very sophisticated equipment and significant industrial resources to enrich Uranium, but it turns out that this equipment can be hidden fairly well and it actually takes much less of an investment to create enrichment facilities for making weapons versus for making reactor fuel (the enrichment level needs to be much higher, but the quantity needs to be vastly smaller). For example, to process natural Uranium into 5% enrichment takes about 75% of the work as to process it into 90% enrichment (weapons grade), and you only need perhaps 16kg or so of highly enriched Uranium to make a bomb. Getting back to observability, these facilities can be easily hidden and operate without notice since they blend in well with other industrial facilities externally. The world learned of Saddam&#x27;s vast Calutron facilities only due to the first Gulf War. And the world learned of North Korea&#x27;s centrifuge cascades only when that regime announced their existence.<p>In the last 50 years half a dozen countries have acquired nuclear weapons without sanction from existing nuclear powers and in most cases without the world being certain of the existence of those nuclear programs until they were announced (such as through weapons tests). That gives some perspective on the true difficulty of preventing nuclear weapons proliferation.<p>As a side note, if the entire worldwide civilian Uranium enrichment capacity was diverted from making reactor fuel to making nuclear bombs it could produce around 400 nuclear bomb cores per week.",1415956723

8606368,comment,8604985,8605870,0,0,mhd,,,"When I look at APL, it seems a bit clearer where this all is coming from. After all, we&#x27;re perfectly fine with using an asterisk as infix notation for multiplication, even if all the rest is done with functions, methods etc.. This isn&#x27;t just the case because we&#x27;ve learned mathematical notation in school and thus &quot;x <asterisk> y&quot; seems natural enough (as opposed to e.g. multiply(x,y)), but also that we learned to accept the &quot;asterisk&quot; as a substitute for the middle position dot or the cross. The same is true for division or especially weird stuff like logical-or...<p>J works along the same lines: First, you had to accept a &quot;widened&quot; set of mathematical operators with arrays as the core. Which is APL with its funky fonts and keyboards. And J then takes away your more readable, but inconvenient to type notation and replaces it with ASCII. It&#x27;s a bit like learning calculus with lisp as your first notation...<p>That&#x27;s the syntactical hurdle. Then you&#x27;ve also got to get used to the array-centric programming model. Just like stacks for forth, functions for functional programming or lists and recursion for lisp.<p>As opposed to lisp, I think the syntax is the bigger issue here for a change. You don&#x27;t just have to change the order in which you read things and ignore some parens, you&#x27;ve got to get over some very deeply ingrained habits, not just from other programming languages, but from normal writing itself. No scanning, neither horizontally nor vertically. The closest analogy for me were regexes, where you can&#x27;t just skip ahead, either.<p>Take that with a grain of salt, I&#x27;m just trying to get into it myself. Two things that I might want to try out to really <i>grok</i> it are programming in that style in other languages (like the infamous Whitney C example) to adjust my reading style without having to adjust to other paradigms at the same time, and to edit APL with <i>ed</i>, so that focusing on a single line becomes potentially easier.<p>edit: replaced asterisk with, well, &quot;asterisk&quot;.

Not the end all-be-all, but he does cite the board of governors and hendershott-riodan as evidence it reduces volatility, some indirect evidence in the short selling ban, the history of QQQ as evidence of lowering cost, tightening spreads.<p>The 'fair value' he's talking about us just the supply-meets-demand of that stock for that particular moment-- that moment could definitely take place in a larger bubble of that security.  The mini-bubble within high freq trading he refutes by reasoning only (""another hft would detect this""), so I think a more concrete example would've been more convincing.  As with all bubbles the question is how far out of line can the price get, and how quickly will the price be brought back to reality",1268848730

For example, the value of many ETFs such as SPY (i.e. an ETF tracking the S&P 500) are derived from the value of underlying securities. If the value of SPY versus the value of the underlying securities becomes out of sync, HFTers may go long one and short the other and then profit when they converge again. In this sense, HFTers only profit if the market returns to fair value. This applies to many ETFs, convertible securities, and options.",1268848546

All you need is a decent quant, application designer, and some co-located machines as close as you can get them (and other easily acquired amenities.) So I could make a reasonable bet you could open a HFT firm with a couple hundred thousand, plus the talent. (And I've confirmed this with a few hedge fund guys, and they pretty much agreed.)<p>And I do completely understand the argument for liquidity: more transactions = more accurate price discovery. But I think problem here is that this entire field is black box, meaning property trading algorithms and trading patterns can  and are used within the system. This can allow a trading AI to go out into the market place, look for pattens, and to create and cancel millions of orders within the fraction of a second.<p>I'm sure you know about the former Goldman Sachs programmer who was charged with theft by the FBI. It was totaled at  around 32 megabytes of software code. Not very much. But Goldman insisted that if this code got out into the market it would be detrimental to their business and violate their trades secrets confidentiality clause. Not to mention Goldman's largest profit center in their business is their proprietary trading desk, which is heavily into HFT.<p>My contention is that if we are really interested in a utility that uniformly benefits the market, then let's have an open source platform that provides that, so we can verify  that any of these firms aren't ""front-running"" their trades.<p>Thats my opinion. I think a lot of the debate over HFT is just filler, it doesn't matter. The guys who are hip to the scene are already making a killing on it now, and it may last a few more years before we begin to regulate.",1268847414

Domain, SSL, languages/servers, etc... Very easy to use, and pretty well priced. My only concern is that update and confirmation emails will be very integral to our service, and it seems that GoDaddy's php mail() setup is sketchy.

I like their flexible pricing, and the fact that you have root access. It also seems like they're pretty polished and easy to use. My main concern here is SSL - I don't know a lot about it, but some hosts I've seen require that you be on a dedicated server for SSL to work. If I buy my own SSL certificate, can I install it onto a Rackspace cloud host?

And just as vegetarians get a boost from it, so do meat-eaters, who also perform better when supplementing Creatine - ask 10 athletes (body builders in particular) and you will find at least 5 who uses it and can vouch for increased stamina from it. Does this, too, mean that they don't get enough? Surely it should, by the logic you've been using, and at this point you are contradicting yourself. From this we can simply draw the conclusion that everyone benefits from more of this in their systems, but it doesn't point to a deficiency of any kind, just as with my example of how artificially increased oxygen levels in the blood doesn't mean we don't get ""enough"" naturally.<p>The point I trying to make just flies by you; You don't KNOW what is enough, you don't KNOW what is too little. You can't say any of this based solely on the proof that _anyone_ performs BETTER when you ADD MORE. This is _not_ synonymous with a deficiency. And the research pointed to doesn't even bring up the specific vegetabilic diets held by the vegetarian subjects of the research, which is a very important detail missing for solidifying the ""facts"" the research is trying to bring forth.

Since SSL/TLS was introduced, we've been running with almost exactly the same trust ""UX"": a hidden browser config panel listing a series of complicated-sounding trusted root CAs, each with the authority to sell or transfer their business to some other entity, or even to delegate the authority to sign certificates to other organizations.<p>That's absurd; it's a security model that clearly can't work in the real world --- and, more, demonstrably hasn't worked. SSL CA's have been caught red-handing selling their authority for dubious reasons. For instance, Trustwave sold a CA=YES certificate to an undisclosed third-party corporation solely for the purpose of making it easier (not ""possible"" but merely easier) for that corporation to monitor their own users.<p>We need a radical rethinking of the UI/UX and trust model behind SSL/TLS, and Moxie's idea of decentralizing that trust --- so that, say, the ACLU could operate a sort of CA root that would vouch for Verisign's signatures on core ecommerce sites but not accept a crazy delegation from Iran.<p>The protocol, on the other hand, is for all its warts the best-tested crypto protocol in possibly the history of computing.

4590840,comment,4589971,4590292,2,0,srunni,,,"> One awesome thing this would allow is for people to create and curate special-interest travel guides.<p>I think there's HUGE potential in an online service that takes care of all the aspects of a trip. Right now you have the choice of either doing everything manually (which is a big time sink) or going on a package tour (which is bland and one-size-fits-all). In between you've got a few options like Expedia and Travelocity, but they're more like extensions of the package tour idea than a rethinking of the concept.<p>In my vision, you'd give it the dates you want to travel, where you want to go, your budget, and access to your social networking accounts (so it can figure out your interests/hobbies). Then it uses the data you've given it along with preexisting curated travel data (which could be based on crowdsourced info, both from previous customers and from 3rd party sources) to create an optimized & customized travel itinerary and take care of all the purchases (plane tickets, hotel reservations, Uber reservations from the airport to the hotel and between sightseeing locations (if needed), tickets for different sightseeing locations, etc.) so that you just have to pay once, to this service. You don't have to worry about when places are open/closed, how long it takes to get between them, etc. - that would be automatically calculated (should be pretty straightforward with Google Maps API access).<p>Then you'd want to have an associated smartphone app that will (in real-time) display the itinerary, give directions between the different places, suggest restaurants to eat at (maybe make reservations using OpenTable), etc. The itinerary could even be dynamic. For example, if there's an outdoor activity planned and it starts raining, it would automatically rearrange your itinerary as necessary, etc. You could use GPS and/or NFC at museums and other places to play back audio explanations of various exhibits (they already have this at many museums, but you have to pay extra for the privilege and wear an iPod or some other clunky device for the duration of the tour).",1348951584

I don't have any data, and I'm failing at finding any right now, but I think of Coca-Cola as being a company which reached its current size primarily through steady growth.  I'm sure there are large pharmaceutical and chemical companies which have had slow growth curves -- while any one product may have a sharp growth curve, the company as a whole won't.  Insurance companies and banks also tend to grow slowly, and of course Berkshire Hathaway is an example, with a highest ever Y/Y growth rate of 59.3%.<p>I suspect there's a certain amount of observation bias: Companies which grow slowly are boring, so we don't think about them.",1348951580

The Windows Store is really transparent about why your app failed certification - first time our app failed it was because we forgot to attach some art assets (icons) to our app. This is the way it was with the Windows Phone marketplace too - when some of the startups I worked with had apps fail for more content-related reasons, it was always followed with an explanation as to what (1) region-specific content restriction was the source of the issue [don't submit apps with maps of disputed territories to China or fashion apps to countries with Sharia law] and (2) were reponsive when asked follow-up questions. This isn't the Apple store - Microsoft has a much higher investment in its relationships with developers.<p>2. The Windows Store terms of service are reasonable / understandable by human beings, and they give you the automated tool they use for checking for bugs / permissions issues (i.e. if you make calls to the location service, you have to make that explicit in your app manifest so the end-user is aware of it) so you can run it yourself before submitting.<p>3. Turnaround time is pretty fast now - our app got approved after we re-submitted within about 8 hours. It'll slow down more once the volume of submissions goes up.<p>Overall, I think it's a lot easier and cheaper to both develop and distribute a Metro app that looks good, works well, and is easily accessible to a large market. You don't have to invent your own distribution channel, and the development experience is much easier and gives you better-looking results right out of the box.",1348950107

This statement that Metro apps on the flagship desktop version of Win 8 will also be restricted is news to me<p>Are we reading the same article here? That article explicitly states that Windows 8 Metro apps will be Store only. I hate to quote half the article but here it is:<p>>However, the company is creating a separate sets of rules for its Metro-style apps  apps that are optimized for touch screen devices but able to run on any Windows 8 machine.<p>>Microsoft is restricting the general distribution of Metro tablet apps  meaning all Metro apps must be downloaded through the new Windows Store. The only ones who get a pass on this restriction are developers and enterprise customers.<p>>The distribution of traditional desktop applications will remain the same, according to Microsoft.<p>>The move to force distribution of Metro apps through the Windows store is similar to Apples treatment of iPhone and iPad apps<p>Where is Windows RT or ARM even mentioned here?<p>>Microsoft is not doing this out of concern for the safety of their customers but rather to increase their own profits and control. But for PR and anti-trust-avoidance purposes, they will sell the loss of freedom as an increase in safety. It's the same bogus argument that overreaching governments use.<p>Citation needed. Anyway, this argument has gone moot in the discussions over the iOS app store. The bird has already flown and Apple can't keep its iOS devices in stock. That argument is a day late and a dollar short.",1348949110

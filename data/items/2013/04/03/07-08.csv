If you are talking about the numerical type, derivation is pretty straightforward: f'(x) = (f(x+epsilon) - f(x-epsilon))/(2*epsilon). If your function is regular enough, 2D integration can be done easily by the trapeze method. But you can check the link given by dudurocha.<p>Now if you are interested in the symbolic type, the differentiation is not too hard on Lisp, but integration is.

One thing I'd like to know though: As someone who's optimizing his debugging skills and environment so thoroughly as you, it surprised me that you love javascript. Don't get me wrong, obviously it has some of the best tooling thanks to its abundance, but doesn't it bug you that it tends to fail silently? I feel that there are quite a few error classes that need to be caught by unit tests in case of JS, where in languages with more rigid type systems (such as python) it gets caught as an exception right on the first run. Or is it that this uneasy feeling about everything you do in JS is what has spawned a culture of more thorough unit testing, such that at the end you're better off?",1364975349

It's not some charity thing either.  I just like to save money.  And this dude is right, drug dealers don't make much money.  They really lack options, like most people in their situation of being poor, minority, and young.  The jobs like mowing lawns barely exist (often because there aren't many lawns).  They sell drugs mainly because wealthier people are willing to drive into the area to buy drugs.  The liquor stores even sell things like nickel bags and smoking gear.  Gangs offer credit.  The product kind of sells itself, the same way that laptops used to sell themselves, or that big screen tvs used to.  When I looked like a dirtbag, people always asked me where to buy drugs.  Middle class college kids were the ones asking.  I usually didn't know.  (I wish people would come up to me and ask to write little utilities for Unix.)<p>One other thing I notice, too - there's just a ton of stress, and nothing harms learning like stress.  I once shared an office in a gangland type area, and it was impossible to work at night because the gunfire and helicopters really stopped any flow of ideas.",1364972456

We never store the plaintext.<p>Device-to-device: standard PKI.  We have a CA, and the CA's cert is bundled with the client software.  Devices generate 2048-bit RSA keys at setup time.  They then generate a PKCS10 CSR which our CA signs, provided you give a valid username/password.  When peers wish to communicate, they establish a DTLS connection (we use OpenSSL's DTLS implementation, and AES-256-CBC as the default ciphersuite), verifying that the other device:<p><pre><code>  * is certified by our CA to represent the claimed user and device (identity)\n  * is not using a certificate with a revoked serial number\n  * is trusted to send and receive information about the relevant shared folder (authorization)\n</code></pre>\nDevice-to-server: Everything between your machine and our servers uses TLS.  Where possible, we trust only our own CA.  Implementation-wise, we use Java's crypto providers for TLS.<p>Revocation: When you unlink or remote-wipe a device, we mark the certificate associated with that device as revoked, and notify each of your clients either immediately (if they're online) or as soon as they come online and reconnect to our push notification service that the revoked device is no longer to be trusted.  (This is one of the other tasks that our servers provide - prompt delivery of device revocation information.)<p>We update our libraries promptly and are subscribed to the appropriate mailinglists.<p>Finally, if you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in some part of the AeroFS system, please contact us at security@aerofs.com (PGP key 6E1DC9F9, if you prefer encrypted email).",1364972439

I think being here as a consultant <i>could</i> potentially be advantageous but it hasn't factored into anything non-entrepreneurial/job related.<p>Also I did the detailed break-down because I hate it when people drop vague numbers without any background detail. Drives me nuts. I know people are curious as to what the cost of living is like in SV, so I figured I'd hammer it out.<p>My goal is to found something consistently profitable and move back out to the country so I can go back to shooting and tooling around on dirt bikes.",1364972430

Techies usually demand more transparency, flexibility, quality and minimalism, while non-techies, paradoxically, generally fall for interfaces with lesser degrees of freedom, which makes them more comfortable with it. Less freedom translates to ""ease of use"" for non-techies.<p>This is why Facebook somewhat intuitively reminds Windows and will most likely share its faith - not exactly dominance, but pretty close to it.",1271842576

There are always a few rough edges, but over all, it's wonderful.  Premiere CS 4 as far as I'm concerned is the best ProSumer video editing app on Windows  (It's been a while since I've used Final Cut. I got fed up with Apple years ago.).<p>After Effects has been nothing short of a phenomenal application for years.  I did an animation project last year with my wife who produces Video, and their Puppet Kinematics tools are really, really cool.  After Effects can be entirely GUI driven, or you can script procedural animations in javascript. I've just started using Adobe On Location for shooting live video, and it's really pretty amazing.  I'm proficient with both PhotoShop and Illustrator as well, and frankly, they are a joy to use.  Every new generation of the CS suite, they add more and more features that I've read about in graphics research papers the previous couple of years.<p>I know that Adobe has been getting a lot of crap recently for it's run ins with Apple and the problems that Flash has running on Apple hardware.  But I suspect that might have a bit more to do with Apple than with Adobe.<p>So, I rather disagree with your assessment on Adobe.",1271842204

I can only guess that Lenovo was getting money (or a reduction on the price for the Windows license) for displaying the sticker. After all, if you buy a standalone Windows, you are not forced to attach a a sticker to your notebook afterwards. So Lenovo could have just bought standalone licenses.<p>So Micrososoft paid for an ad, and Lenovo didn't want to display it despite getting the money.

I haven't seen too much innovation coming from them, outside of their traditional bread and butter (and that innovation is incremental at best).<p>However, I do agree that many software companies do this - but I disagree that it is in their own self interest. I think it is in the management's short-term self interest because they are rewarded with stock options that mature in the short term that they can then cash out. So they might make additional revenue from advertising in the short-term, but what does that do to their loyal customer base in the long term.<p>I did encounter something similar (not as grotesque) with Sun when I installed Open Office....but for some reason it never rubbed me the way this one did.<p>Also...much to my surprise, when I was installing Avast Free A/V, I was shocked (and disappointed) to see a screen prompting me to install a 'free and secure web browser from Google'.

There's a limit to the difficulties a natural language will throw at someone.  Since writing systems are constructed that may not be the case.<p>It's also possible that the very different experiences of Japanese and Chinese learners learning to read are due to the expectations the locals place on themselves.  In Japan, once you know the Joyo Kanji, you can be pretty confident that you'll have furigana to help you when tougher words show up in newspapers, in video games or even on TV.  In Taiwan, on the other hand, the only place you'll find significant help from zhuyin is in materials made for children.

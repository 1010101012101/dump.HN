I'd have presumed that one would use ""is"" when referring to the country, and ""are"" when referring to the group of states. Is this incorrect? (for what it's worth, I'm from the UK ;)",1292155161
1996942,comment,1996793,1996905,0,0,catch23,,,"FYI, the people who founded Zappos did not create Tellme.  You're probably thinking of Alfred Lin who actually joined Zappos as the CFO much later (after Tony), and happened to be a VP at Tellme.  At least according to Tony's book, he was a PhD student before he joined Zappos.<p>The founder of Zappos is actually Nick Swinmurn even though many people still think it was Tony.  Tony probably owns a lot more of Zappos than Nick, but neither of them had anything to do with Tellme.<p>Mike McCue was the founder of Tellme who most recently departed from Microsoft, and before Tellme he worked at Netscape.",1292154828

Alternatively, Twlio lets a modestly competent web developer take an existing app and add voice/SMS features to it in about a day.  (Have a social site?  Want to do SMS notifications when something important happens?  You can implement that in four hours.)",1292154804

1996937,comment,1996237,1996237,0,0,SandB0x,,,"In the last year I have seen a lot of new BlackBerry users in London. However, the majority of these have been teenagers on the bus using some entry level model, which is available on pay-as-you-go, or with a very cheap contract. I get the impression this was not their first choice of phone, and I think this (anecdotal evidence) matches the author's analysis.<p>All the older BlackBerry users I know have switched to iPhone/Android, and at most carry their BB as a secondary, mandated work phone. One friend complained that ""it's like they took an old desktop pc and just decided to shrink all the icons"".<p>I hope RIM can pull it together but it doesn't sound too healthy.",1292154452

There is: simply not use Facebook, or if you use it, use it carefully.<p>There is a reason I do not link my Facebook account from my professional website and/or Linked-in account. And there is a reason I simply not use Facebook to share my private life with anybody.<p>The thing is that I have a private life which I don't want the whole internet to know about, sure I may want to share something with my real friends but I'm so old fashion that I prefer talking about it in a pub...<p>In the end I think people will learn not to be careless.",1292153612

1996930,comment,1996416,1996416,0,0,Mz,,,"I think that, as with any big change, if people will go ahead and start adapting voluntarily it doesn't necessarily have to be some huge crisis.  Some do-able means to adapt:  live closer to work, shop closer to home, walk more, car-pool, etc.  Some companies are actively trying to encourage more car-pooling, living within walking distance of work, telework, etc.  It looks to me like a drop in the bucket compared to what will be needed but I'm still glad to see it.  The real challenge is trying to make sure such things don't wind up being ""a day late and a dollar short"".",1292153170
1996929,comment,1996885,1996885,0,0,iuguy,,,"This is an incredible example of the 'zombie code' problem. You lose the source to something and are somehow expected to maintain it anyway.<p>Years ago at a previous employer, we had an old xenix system that ran a library book lending system. The company that maintained it had gone bust long ago and noone knew how to migrate the data, in fact noone really knew xenix either. I ended up (as the Linux and y2k guy) working with one of the smartest guys I've ever met to hunt the data down. In the process I learnt xenix and Geoff learnt xenix x86 assembly. Geoff patched the library system to start dumping out csvs. Then he patched an import function, then an extra field to indicate the year starting with 19 or 20 (to solve the y2k problem all we had to do was shutdown for Christmas, bring the box up in January, set the date to 1900 and we'd be fine. It didn't quite turn out that way but that was another story) and after a significant post y2k problem Geoff took over maintaining a defunct piece of software on a defunct platform, for 3 years. The library didn't migrate because they didn't need to, as long as they had Geoff. After I left, Geoff took over xenix admin (to be fair, not a lot to do) and a few years later fell very ill. While the library thought they'd saved money, ultimately they trapped themselves in an expert system that could only prolong the inevitable disaster on the horizon.",1292153164

Tropo would supply non-U.S. numbers if I needed them<p>3. Tropo made it easy to do the voice recording and POST it as an MP3<p>4.

Obviously their target market is the web app developer crowd.<p>To do it yourself you need to line up your outbound SIP providers, inbound DID providers (not one and the same once you dig into the details), then you need to operate a bunch of Freeswitch / Asterisk / whatever SIP servers, and learn how to program them, and learn how keep them running smooth (Not particularly difficult, but in terms of learning requirements - it's akin to meeting a database + web server for the first time).<p>Due to the real-time nature of telcos (and I mean that in the traditional clock-synch'd sense of the word) there are additional complications if you want to use a virtualised OS.",1292152395

181634,comment,181513,181513,0,0,kogir,,,"PHP is the VBScript of the open source world. It's available on almost every web host, and it seems to be what beginners learn first. While I'm sure it's possible to write things in a safe and mantainable way, most code examples you see will be from beginners and will have problems with the OWASP top 10. You can't look to the built in libraries for inspiration beacuse they're usually poorly designed. 
Just because there have been success stories in a language (cold fusion and myspace, php and facebook) doesn't mean it's right for you. It took me one website and only 1000 lines of code to decide against PHP. If you've used it longer and like it, it's probably fine.",1210010058

Though you give multiple reasons why a person might not use a framework, you neglect the good points that are obviously making people use them.<p>""Frameworks suck because they are an avatar of enterprise, frameworks suck because they take away your freedom, frameworks suck because they build walls between coders, frameworks suck because they make you fit your project to the toolset rather than the toolset to the project, and frameworks suck because they take the fun out of programming, long live the library.""<p>Please answer this: why DO people use frameworks?",1210009522

Those at the bottom of the profession see only the mechanical process of churning out code, drawing a room, prescribing medication, and making a pot from clay.<p>Those at the top are, for lack of a better term, at one with their profession, and programming is certainly no different.  A good programmer can feel, in a very visceral way, the difference between good and bad code, in the same way that the average person can feel the difference between Michelangelo and street graffiti.  I consider myself to be only a very mediocre coder, and yet every now and then, I see a program that is just... beautiful.  Aesthetically pleasing.  And I couldn't tell you why.<p>Things like that can't be diagramed or taught; it's up to the individual to grow that seed of what Pirsig calls 'Quality' within themselves.",1210009480

A great deal of the DARPA budget is dedicated to paying companies like Intellectual Ventures, or their partners, to develop one or another of their ideas into some military technology. Moreover, companies like Intellectual Ventures would not exist if it wasn't for the fact that -- unlike consumers -- the U.S. Government is often happy to pay for ideas that have no successful implementation, and may never have one.<p>Do you think it's a <i>coincidence</i> that one of Intellectual Ventures' key employees is a former <i>Star Wars</i> researcher? Do you think it's a coincidence that one of their brainstorms was a way to prevent post-injury strokes in soldiers? Companies like this one don't brainstorm at random; they think towards the money, just as a plant grows toward sunlight.<p>It's not all military, of course: The NIH and the NSF are also good for pure-research money.",1210009405

I don't think people realize the SMS infrastructure/expenditure needed to pull off something like Twitter.<p>Their 5 digit short code costs (at least) $1k/month in the US.  Twitter has these in multiple countries.  Each received message costs approx. $.03 and each sent message costs approx. $.05.  Added up over 30mil. messages per month (avg. of $.04 per msg.) = $1.2mil.  Twitter is almost certainly getting a better rate, but their monthly messaging expenditure is certainly multiples of $100k.<p>For those of you saying, 'Oh, but what about sending TXT msgs via email.  I do that on my homebrew project, and its great!'  Sending 30mil msgs (and growing) WILL NOT work via email, the carriers will NEVER let you do that.<p>I could go on about the technical reasons Twitter cant be distributed and FREE, but in any substantial mobile play you have to deal with the carriers, their infrastructure, and their fees.

We have gotten more disciplined in designing code, compartmentalizing it into classes, documenting the code etc.<p>However, I recently read an article on YC about how many startups go through a phase debating about which language an application should be built on. We did not give this much thought as we saw a few prominent websites like facebook use PHP and we thought PHP seemed to be a pretty scalable language. Plus, with support for OOP (as of PHP 5), PHP seemed to be a pretty good choice.<p>I am interested in evaluating if we made the right decision",1210008973

181610,comment,181392,181479,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Remember that, unlike modern copyright and all trademarks, patents still expire. You get 17 to 20 years. If Newton had patented calculus... the patent would have expired centuries ago.<p>So let's try an alternative view of Intellectual Ventures: They perform the valuable service of donating piles and piles of inventions to the world's stock of prior art. Each donation takes twenty years to mature, of course, but after that it's available to be developed into a product without any patent worries, because the patent will have already been filed and allowed to expire. If one of their ideas looks particularly great and you don't want to have to wait twenty years, you can get an early start just by paying them a royalty.<p>This, of course, is <i>the original purpose and spirit</i> of the patent laws. And, though patents are broken in various ways right now, that purpose is still alive -- especially relative to the terrible situation with copyright law, which is nigh-100% broken thanks to the Disney Corporation and its pet lawmakers.",1210008771

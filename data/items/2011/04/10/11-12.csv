I just like reading it as some kind of alternate Harry version with some tangents that appeal to the science nerd or socially inept geek side of me.<p>There are many moments where full knowledge of the Harry Potter books (at least the first 3) seems important. Also I don't think you would have much fun if you do not know how the characters normally are.<p>It seems really long. I am not even one third through it yet.<p>To be honest, I often noticed myself skip over the parts where some scientific method or things like that are explained/discussed. It is written well enough that so far I could pick up the gist just by reading lightly as I always do (scanning the pages rather than reading word by word (I wish I could do that sometimes)).",1302436797

The innards of a Dyson vacuum cleaner are no doubt ingenious, but the early models all weighed a ton and were incredibly difficult to lug around the house and actually clean stuff.<p>Same with the AirBlade. Clever idea, but it doesn't dry your hands, and the blast of air knocks your hands into the sides, negating all the claims of better hygiene.<p>I'm sure the Dyson process involves tons of prototypes, but I don't for a second believe they actually spend much time looking at people _using_ the damn things.",1302435529

I've dabbled with more powerful languages in my spare time, but I've been using Java 8+ hours a day for the last 3 years.<p>If I were to launch a startup, should I go with the ""cool shiny powerful"" language, or should I stay with the boring verbose language that I know well? Would the fun factor of using Clojure / Scala / Ruby / Python / Blub++ be worth it? Would the language ""power"" offset the time ""lost"" gaining experience with a new platform? What about hiring? Hackers love powerful languages.<p>So many tradeoffs.",1302434343

Our development team is familiar with Java and related technologies and we're looking at platforms for a greenfields project that will allow us to build realtime messaging services (in this case for medical referrals). We were attracted to Lift as it has excellent support for Comet, supposedly allows for very secure apps, and runs on the jvm (nice, but not a requirement).<p>My only initial concern is that without any prior experience with Scala we might find some of the concepts in Lift too foreign. Are there other approaches to building realtime systems that you'd recommend as an alternative or are we on the right track?",1302434196

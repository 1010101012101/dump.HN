1792327,comment,1792181,1792181,0,0,carbocation,,,"This is false. Hear me out.<p>I think that the notion of cell phones causing cancer is bunk for two reasons, but I recognize that there is a third possibility. First, the reasons why I think cell phones don't cause cancer:<p>(1) Physics. Microwaves are non-ionizing radiation, so cell phones don't directly lead to strand breakage in your DNA or protein adducts.<p>(2) Epidemiology. The body of evidence, on balance, does not support the notion that exposure to cell phones increases your risk for cancer. We are getting hugely exposed to this radiation, and if it had an effect, you'd strongly expect to see it. Perhaps we're a few decades away from being able to appreciate any risk since brain tumors more commonly affect those later on in life, but the epidemiology doesn't support the connection at this time.<p>There. I don't think that cell phones cause cancer, and I have given 2 reasons why I believe that. However, I am willing to acknowledge that biology is nothing if not interesting.<p>For example, imagine an enzyme that was designed to (a) receive microwave radiation, putting it into a slightly different conformation, which then (b) hydrolyzes ATP in order to (c) cut DNA. Why would this enzyme exist? Who knows; <i>I don't think it does</i> exist. But I am saying that physics cannot tell us that ""low energy thing X"" cannot do ""high energy thing Y."" It only tells us that the connection, if any, must be mediated by a third party. In other words, sure, microwaves cannot cause strand breakage, but they could be part of a signalling cascade that ultimately results in strand breakage.<p>Keep in mind that I don't believe in any of this garbage, but I do believe that it's within the realm of possibility and therefore we actually do still need epidemiology and molecular biology.",1287085996

I don't want to work for a company that isn't bothered by starting off with a cliche.  But then again, maybe neither of us are the kind of person they're trying to hire.<p>In the rewrite, it's a great opening line if you're shooting for somebody in the YC universe.  If not, starting with an acronym that people don't know is a turn off.  At least to me, it gives the impression of wanting a utility player (rather than somebody with deep skills at anything in particular) who wants to work in a relaxed programmer-friendly environment (as opposed to somebody who's passionate about whatever it is they'll be working on or is looking to join a business-focused company).  If that's what they're looking for, great.

What the parent was saying is that you have to be super careful with the types of pointers and integers because C will let you use them interchangeably. This is obviously not true, despite the rain of inexplicable upvotes. He then has a pointer arithmetic example which is really not so much about typing but about understanding pointer arithmetic.<p>Of course C will also let you treat pointers as integers and vice versa, especially if you explicitly tell it to, by casts. But in the general case, it will whine and, in fact, reducing unnecessary whining is one of the reasons to not go hog-wild with useless typedefs.

Now, with WP7, they, again, try to standardize hardware in order to commoditize it for their software. That's not healthy in the long run.<p>Consider our PCs compared to their GPUs. PCs are a very standardized platform, with little variation allowed between different models. The average PC of 2010 is only a couple times faster than the average PC of 2005. Now, compare the average GPU of 2005 to the average GPU of 2010. The reason it happens is because GPUs are a widely diverse bunch. A couple years back, we were building number crunchers (we still are) out of x86s.

You address this really well, and I really like your passage on abstractions, but I don't agree that the magic is just limited to advanced usage of the language.<p>Here's my gripe in its most pure form: in Python, in order to figure out <i>all</i> of my capabilities <i>right now</i> (short of what things I can import), I can use dir(object_i_want_to_know_about) and see everything that object can do. I've got a friend who's learning Ruby, and we wanted to find a built-in String method to see if a string starts with a prefix. We found it after Googling, but I wanted to find out about it in the context of the REPL. I figured that Ruby must have similar functionality to Python's dir(), but as far as I can tell, the only way to achieve that is to hack the REPL in a very minor way (you can add a few lines to your .irbc that will achieve this). There doesn't seem to be anything like dir() built into the language, and so it's a lot harder to figure out what you can do at any given point in time without Googling.<p>I think that this difference speaks volumes about the difference in philosophies between the two languages, and is in large part why when I introduce friends to programming these days, I tend to do it via Python, in particular via Zed's book.<p>I haven't used Ruby much in the past year or two, though, so if I'm completely mistaken about my assertions here, I'd love to find out about ways in which I can reason about the options available to me when I'm hacking around in irb.<p>PS: I really liked the code example near the end of the article.",1287083815

They are the primary source for all of the major fantasy sites, though some use secondary sources (I think for accuracy verification).<p>At Draftmix we used a competitor of theirs called PA Sports Ticker, which Stats bought shortly after we shut Draftmix down. We had previously used a cheaper one called XML Team, but we realized quickly that we had gotten what we had paid for as the feeds were often updated very late or contained errors. They're fine enough for getting started (and probably the easiest to implement, since you pull the data on demand rather than having them post it to you) especially if you don't require live stats. Live stats cost more and are harder to implement. You could get post-game stats and schedule data for a few grand  a year back then from XML Team, live stats for a few times that, but I don't know what Stats buying their primary competitor has done to prices.

1792142,comment,1791052,1791904,0,0,thwarted,,,"Agreed.  I spent way too much time reading old mailing lists and server and client specific docs when trying to understand the protocol (not any specific software that used it) while writing nodebot (<a href=""http://github.com/thwarted/nodebot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/thwarted/nodebot</a>).  RFC1459 is seriously lacking in real-world use, explanation of terms, and general robustness, despite that it was written to document a defacto protocol.<p>On the other hand, you do see a lot of the organic evolution of a protocol in what is IRC, which is valuable from both an historical and educational perspective.",1287083061
1792141,comment,1791588,1791588,0,0,cloudkj,,,"Hmmm, seems to me there's a business opportunity in providing lower cost, more developer friendly sports data. I remember looking into getting access to sports data since I wanted to do some analytics after I read Moneyball. Old, archived data is easy to come by, but any fresh, real-time data sources seem to have non-trivial costs.<p>I guess there might be some restrictions on who gets access to the official raw data for various games, depending on the sports league. If the costs for getting that data are high, then the only way to circumvent that would be to collect them yourself. Even then, I don't know if the leagues would come at you hard for gathering data and using team names or player names...",1287083057

While Blackberry etc. release a whole armada of smartphones, as if to say 'we hope variety can make up for a lack of quality,' Apple typically release one model with some minor variation, as if to say 'we tried to make the best, and we know we have, so here it is. There's no point in releasing anything else.'",1287083047

1792134,comment,1790564,1790564,0,0,bho,,,"One idea i've really been thinking about is traffic analysis over time.<p>Where I live, traffic is highly variable. If I leave 5 minutes later one morning, there might be no traffic at all, but if I left another 3 minutes after that, I would be stuck in heavy traffic. If there was some way we could track the rate of traffic over time (say, plot out the mph between 7am-8am) every morning, I bet after a month we could figure out the ideal times to leave for work.<p>Google maps already uses crowdsourcing for its traffic data, so maybe that's the way to go. I would need a large sample size though. I researched a few cities and Houston, TX has sensors that use the toll RFIDs to determine traffic conditions. There are tons of other applications for this data, too. Think of shipment or delivery companies (UPS...), among others.",1287082962

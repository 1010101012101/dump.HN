(This is one of many reasons why we're re-writing it to be web-based)<p>\nI think that when it comes to behavior on this subject, there are really two types of users..<p>The users who are bittorrent downloading, streaming media and other things where cutting out the internet connection would matter.. And the others, who just want to do some homework, then play a game for a while.<p>For the people who just want to play for a while, having the rest of their internet cut out won't be a major issue.. If they're playing the game, they can't browse the web, or use AIM, but since it's full-screen, they wouldn't be able to do those things anyway.<p>For the other folk, who use their connection heavily downloading torrents (legally), and listening to streaming radio- They're far more likely to be technically savvy enough to forward the ports necessary to make the game work, and wouldn't require any sort of VPN at all.",1196159802
83888,comment,83685,83879,0,0,e1ven,,,"Sadly, a very, very large number. While Cx users are technically inclined, there's a surprising number of casual players who may not have the technical acumen to forward ports, even with an illustrated guide.<p>We've had several users quit because they can't/won't configure their firewalls, so we needed an automatic solution.<p>upnp just isn't reliable- It fails in > 60% cases, according to some case study I can't find at the moment. <p>Hamachi won't work for the reasons above. Too Expensive, and requires both parties to have the VPN installed.<p>Our only solution was to roll our own.",1196159362
83887,comment,83685,83767,0,0,e1ven,,,"That's what openvpn is for.<p>Basically, it deals with the NAT-traversal elements for me, once I've twisted it's arm into doing so.. It works, if I recall correctly, using the UDP trick to keep a port open by sending traffic to a host repeatedly.<p>The nice part about the hack that I'm using is that I don't need to deal with the specifics of the UDP punching, or how often to poll, etc.. I can use industry tested and standard software for that. <p>Think of it this way-<p>Have you ever worked at a large corporation, that has a VPN? Once connected to that VPN, you could access all the servers internally, and they could access you, right?<p>We're basically creating a VPN, and giving everyone an internal IP address.. And then using linux, iptables, and NATing to map all those internal ip addresses to external ones.<p><p>",1196159184

83885,comment,83881,83881,0,0,jward,,,"This isn't an easy problem.  One thing you could do is mod the moderators.  Have each persons vote count a certain amount.  People who report true spam you bump up, and people who are abusive get bumped down, perhaps to the point where their opinion doesn't matter.  Then require a minimum threshold before you have to deal with it.  Also have this ranked against the up votes and popularity.<p>On imageboard.net we have it setup so more than one person has to mod something down to hide it.  It still doesn't work that great, but it's better than nothing.",1196159070

Some folks have started to use that link to try to get rid of polls they don't agree with.<p>I'm a fan of PG's ""Things you can't say"" premise (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html</a>), and I'd love to try to guide the site in that direction.  <p>The ideal would be that <i>abusive</i> questions are modded down, but ""questions you don't like"" aren't.  It doesn't mean they'll be voted up and become popular enough to run, but it means they won't be squashed either.<p>I guess one option would be to remove the ""mark as inappropriate"" completely, and/or have trusted community members able to remove questions if needed.<p>Thoughts?  Any advice would be much appreciated.<p>Thanks!",1196158232

By the sounds of it the users of your game would know how do operate a firewall. Just out of interest what percentage of your users asked for this? ",1196158027

I would hope that in the same situation, I would realize that giving 2/3 of a company to a casual friend and her friend (that I don't know) means losing control.<p>In a situation where you have 3 good friends, I would expect that to work out well, because any 2-sided disputes could be resolved democratically without much fuss.",1179471085

I have about a 20-minute walk to class, and I find that it's either relaxing, to just walk and not do anything else, or I'm deep in thought, considering the day's lecture topics, project ideas, implementation ideas for a current project, or any number of other things.<p>I have often found myself disappointed that so many people are wrapped up in technology and oblivious to the world around them.  I think that if more people allowed themselves some downtime, everyone would be a lot less stressful and more friendly.",1179470751

22980,comment,22794,22794,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I think it's just a sign of how desperate the press is for any story. Especially in the Tech Crunch example you gave, the article was really pretty much filler, in my opinion, and by throwing any small thing in there, they were able to make it a little bit larger.<p>Also, you have to remember that the more traditional press companies are used to the corporate programming atmosphere, where any proposed change has to go through several levels just to get approved.  In this case, even if the programming takes less than an hour, it's probably anywhere from a day to a week of work to go from idea to product.  Yes, this is absurd, but it is what the press is used to, so any small change is interesting to them, because they might not consider that it only took a trivial amount of time to put in place.",1179469409
22977,comment,22928,22928,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I like the color scheme, actually.  I am quite partial to the color scheme because I agree with Maddox (though I don't read his site much anymore) that looking at a white background is basically the same thing as staring as a light bulb.  If the entire Internet used dark backgrounds, it would be a much warmer experience, in my opinion.<p>That said, perhaps the text needs to be just slightly lighter in order to give it a little more contrast with the background.  Also, the size is minuscule.  I know that Ctrl-+ is not too hard to press, but if that's the first thing that every visitor has to do, it's kind of a waste of time.  On my display, at least, the size of event titles is about the same size as the normal text on this site.  I would personally increase the size by 25-50%, but I tend to like larger text, so take that recommendation with a grain of salt.<p>I agree with the other comments that the front page should have a little bit more useful information.  It could be something like a list (in order of decreasing popularity) of the events that are happening that day.  The search seems somewhat strange, because if I was using that site, I think it would be in a situation where I'm like, ""Hmm... what am I going to do tonight?"" not a situation where I already know what I want to do and just want to figure out when it is happening (although that is a legitimate use case as well).<p>In spite of the criticisms, I'm liking the idea, and I wish you the best of luck with it.  Have you considered trying to tie it into e.g. Google Calendar so that people can easily add events?  Of course, ideas like that are just added features, but I'm curious where you plan on going with this.",1179468816

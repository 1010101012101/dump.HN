Though I can understand where one might read that in.... :-><p>My actual assumption is that long-form writers have always been and likely always will be a definite minority - hence our value in many situations. (A necessary step to attaining that value is, not so ironically, learning to  summarize and to &quot;hook&quot;, because like it or not, even if we deal only with other long-formers, we all have so much on our plates that we cannot devote sufficient time to reading through everything each other writes to decide whether it is worthwhile to read. We need abstracts, filters, curation, etc. It&#x27;s not ironic because we have to have had the hard slog first to get the long form before we tweet, bullet, etc.)<p>My other assumption - more of a grumpy old man conclusion, really - is that the rise and acceptance of the bullet and the tweet and the SMS has given voice to a great many who otherwise would be excluded from many serious conversations.<p>Yes, there are gems in their output, but so few and far between that their output rarely rises to the level of discourse and rarely becomes impactful or lasting. On the whole, intellectually I think we are worse off for the additional noise, but socially better off for the addition of their voices. Overall, we are slightly better off, and if that means we need to work harder to filter for the signal, so be it, better to have more voices than fewer.<p>At least socially we are better off. As a whole.<p>But a great many specific communities are worse off because of the minimal level of effort required to inject one&#x27;s meanginglessness and laziness into serious discussions. Witness &quot;me too&quot;/&quot;this&quot;/&quot;+1&quot;/etc. in comments, tweets, emails, etc.<p>So I&#x27;m happier human being because so many people are able to join in global conversations, but I&#x27;m grumpier subject matter expert because too many are wandering about my enclave leaving mud everywhere.",1399838297

The arguments between these massive companies are deciding the future of peer-to-peer communications on the internet.<p>If the ones who own the wires win, the internet will be officially divided into two classes: servers and clients. Netflix will still be as fast as it ever was (if not faster) if it pays, and if it doesn&#x27;t, the wire-owners&#x27; new replacements will be just as fast as Netflix was. All of the current players will be making massive content and distribution deals with each other, and the internet will become cable TV.<p>There&#x27;s no technical reason that the internet has to be structured that way. This is all just massive incumbents locking out all small fry, and consequently all newcomers. The scale this is being played out in is so large that Netflix is really the newcomer in the situation; this is not just a matter of protecting an oligarchy of entertainment providers, but even a war between content producers and content distributors that has implications that affect how fast the traffic between you and your mother will be, and what programs you will be allowed to use to produce and receive that traffic.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s a defense of a primitive accumulation. Some people own the wires because they were first. We can either let them manipulate the market so all of their vendors have razor-thin margins and all of their consumers have the most constrained agreements and highest prices, or restrict the right of the owners to shape and filter traffic for business purposes.",1399837973

Need automatic device-node creation, and the ability to run programs based on device events? udev did this just fine before systemd.<p>And yet nothing integrated all those features well enough to get people to widely adopt them.  systemd services make it trivial to run a process in its own cgroup, isolate it, log everything about it, activate services as needed, and manage and track services launched in response to devices.  There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from building your own Linux distribution that integrates all of those tools, and there are certainly enough systemd opponents to try.  If they build something compelling, people might use it.<p>(Also, insserv doesn&#x27;t come close to the parallel boot that systemd enables, via socket activation, bus activation, and similar.  If B and C depend on A, insserv lets you start B and C in parallel, but systemd lets you start A, B, and C in parallel.)<p>> Systemd&#x27;s components are tightly-coupled. How, pray tell, do I run logind without systemd as PID 1? How, pray tell, do I remove journald? Oh, that&#x27;s right. I can&#x27;t. By design. That makes it monolithic.<p>To run logind without systemd, you can wait for the cgmanager folks to provide an implementation of equivalent cgroup management functionality for logind to use.  Until then, your complaint is much like the complaints about systemd not running on Linux: Linux has features other OSes don&#x27;t, and systemd intentionally takes advantage of them, &quot;by design&quot;.  Does that make the combination of systemd and the Linux kernel &quot;monolithic&quot;?<p>This is &quot;by design&quot; in much the same way that a program using features from Python 2.7 that don&#x27;t work in Python 2.6 does so &quot;by design&quot;.  And it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for a project to refuse patches for compatibility with Python 2.6 and say &quot;upgrade to 2.7&quot;.  Just like it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for some projects to say &quot;run Linux&quot; or &quot;run systemd&quot;, because it has features that nothing else does.<p>> By contrast, X.org and Xfree86 (an example from the article) were largely interchangeable.<p>They were in the start, when X.org initially forked from the XFree86 codebase.  But today, you cannot drop XFree86 underneath a modern desktop environment and expect it to work; it&#x27;ll complain about the myriad X extensions introduced in X.org to make those desktop environments possible.  And yet, nobody noticed, because nobody cares about XFree86 anymore.",1399837343

7729679,comment,7728692,7729410,2,0,pmahoney,,,"I agree with your points, though am disappointed by this reality. I&#x27;ve been aware of daemontools for some years, but only recently read over the design (which I find quite brilliant) and began using an implementation (s6 at the monent [1]).<p>I know you weren&#x27;t arguing against daemontools, but just wanted to share some thoughts:<p>> Service directories make sense, but they tend to be shell scripts all the way down<p>This is true, but what are you doing in your &quot;run&quot; script that is so complex?  Also, any executable will suffice. s6 provides &#x27;execline&#x27; [2] which simplifies some use cases (and complicates others...)<p>> Logging is quite different and non-centralized<p>Arguably a feature. I&#x27;m quite enjoying the &quot;logging chain&quot; where every service logs to stderr which either goes to its specific logger process or bubbles up to that of the parent process.<p>The typical usage of syslog is to collect all log messages in a centralized inbox and then (by some pattern matching; log messages must contain enough to be categorized) split them up again and write them to separate files.  Skip all that with logger-per-service.<p>> Services need to be set not to fork and do their own daemon management.<p>Clearly a feature. There is no need for the redundancy of multiple,  error-prone implementations of daemonization routines in every service. Also, language nitpick, it&#x27;s not that a service can&#x27;t fork. For example, daemontools can happily supervise a Unicorn master process that will fork off its own workers. The service must not background itself by severing ties with its parent (which involves forking of course).<p>But there are downsides and quirks as you say. Two examples:<p>If you really want something like Nginx or Unicorn to be able to restart without dropping http connections (e.g. fork+exec new master process, gracefully shutdown and kill old master process), then you will run into issues. It&#x27;s possible to hackishly wrap this in a helper script. Daemontools would supervise the helper, which would in turn manage nginx via plain old racy PID files, just like init.d scripts.<p>I&#x27;m only familiar with daemontools and s6, but they assume TERM is the signal to use to stop a service, and don&#x27;t provide configuration to send, say, QUIT which Unicorn interprets as &quot;graceful shutdown&quot;. (Upstart also did not allow this until fairly recent versions.) It&#x27;s one thing to get a service to not daemonize itself. It&#x27;s another thing to expect upstream to modify its signal handling.<p>[1] <a href=""http://skarnet.org/software/s6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skarnet.org/software/s6/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://skarnet.org/software/execline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skarnet.org/software/execline/</a>",1399837230

Zope 3 never gained any significant traction, because in adopting a &quot;component architecture&quot; they decided to use XML to connect those individual components, and it felt like you spent more time writing XML than Python. IMO this was a strategic mistake.<p>In 2005 the Django framework was released. In 2006, Ruby on Rails was released. After a couple years of confusion about the Zope roadmap, developers now had multiple options.

7729582,comment,7728692,7729482,3,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> So, basically you&#x27;re advocating for a walled garden approach<p>You can get integration without a walled garden.  There are no walls on the systemd garden; there&#x27;s just a well-maintained garden that attracts an increasing number of people.  You don&#x27;t need walls to keep people in when you have sufficiently compelling technology that they want to stay.<p>And you didn&#x27;t actually respond to anything in the mailing list post about &quot;choice&quot;, other than its tone.  There&#x27;s a key point to be learned from that post: just because a alternatives exist doesn&#x27;t mean they all have to be equally well supported by every Linux distribution.  Linux distributions, as one of their primary functions, make choices for the user: they select a set of components and make those components work well together.  systemd helps there, by providing a set of components that integrate quite well, and by getting rid of some of the zero-value differences between distributions (/etc/hostname versus /etc/HOSTNAME versus /etc/sysconfig/..., for instance).<p>> Or because Linux userland developers have historically been bad at cathedrals? The bazaar has always been more suited to the Linux community, and makes Linux distinct and refreshing compared to BSDs (which are an example of cathedral done right, by the way).<p>I actually agree with this, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a response to what I said.  Linux, in <i>not</i> using the cathedral method, has a hard time making major changes to escape local maxima, and when such changes do happen it&#x27;s typically through the focused efforts of a small group dedicated to fixing a particular class of issues.  For instance, the Linux kernel is a bazaar, but major new subsystems are not typically developed collaboratively <i>from scratch</i>, they&#x27;re provided in a functional initial form and then evolved from there.  And when it finally comes time to replace them, they&#x27;re typically replaced as a unit rather than incrementally evolved.<p>And personally, I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing Linux distributions learn something about organization from the BSDs, not least of which by requiring that all packages appear in the same version control system side-by-side on the same server.<p>> If the systemd team&#x27;s insistence on not taking patches for alternative libcs<p>systemd refuses to work around bugs in other software unless absolutely necessary; when that software is FOSS, it can be fixed rather than worked around.  And systemd does have some patches to handle less capable libc implementations, such as definitions of system calls that libc implementations might not have.  On the other hand, it seems quite reasonable to require functions like asprintf rather than reimplementing them, especially for an init system specifically designed for Linux.<p>> Lennart&#x27;s circular argument on why you should adopt systemd because of systemd-logind being tightly coupled and hard to reimplement<p>logind needs cgroups.  PID 1 needs to manage cgroups.  There&#x27;s a solution that works today, providing features that desktop environments need, for which alternatives do not yet exist.  And if you&#x27;re not a fan of that solution, there are people working right now to create an alternative solution using cgmanager.<p>> the recent Kay Sievers controversy<p>In which kernel developers ranted about a bug in systemd that had already been fixed before the discussion ever started, and proposed childish kernel patches like &quot;if PID 1 is named systemd, panic()&quot;...<p>> the systemd team very much have their own convictions that are at odds with anyone else<p>Per my previous comment: &#x27;Not least of which because anyone attempting to make such changes has to be prepared for the anti-change &quot;but the UNIX way!&quot; flames.&#x27;<p>Yes, the systemd team is trying to make large-scale changes to the way Linux works.

It&#x27;s an interesting new phenomenon, because it seems to indicate that esports may finally be taking off.<p>Valve basically crowdfunded their tournament prize pool.  They started out by offering an initial $1.6M prize pool, but gave every dota 2 player the option of buying a &quot;compendium&quot; for $10, and each compendium increases the prize pool by $2.50.  That means Valve makes $7.50 per compendium sold.<p>I just ran the math, and as of right now there have been ($3,365,563 - $1,600,000)/$2.50 = 706,255 compendiums purchased.  Since Valve earns $7.50 per compendium, that means they just made $5.3M in a couple days.  And they&#x27;re set to make even more next year, since the Dota 2 playerbase has some nice exponential growth: <a href=""http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&appid=570&from=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&appid=570&from=...</a><p>I&#x27;m not sure there are any articles about this yet, because this news is so new.

While I complain more than anyone I know about the underlying infrastructure, it&#x27;s a salvageable situation.<p>In fact, because of the lack of standardization on a single toolset or approach (e.g. Cocoa, WPF, etc.), we&#x27;re in a position to improve well beyond the current SoTA. Some examples:<p>React.js from IG/FB: One of the first opportunities in the browser to treat rendering as a stateless canvas, freeing us from the complexity of time-management.<p>ClojureScript[1] - and more importantly, the immutable data structures from ClojureScript, let us simplify our UI programs conceptually. And combining it with React (Om), we can make UI&#x27;s both <i>fast</i> and <i>simple</i><p>Datascript & friends: Bringing entire in-memory databases client-side.<p>All of these, and the wide-open nature of the web as it exists today, means we&#x27;re in a position to experiment with radically new ideas and find a much more efficient way of representing our goals. It&#x27;s a really exciting time to be working on this stuff.<p>Nevertheless, I upvoted because I do believe we&#x27;re in a plato&#x27;s-cave situation with current practices in web-development. There&#x27;s very little overlap between the desktop and web world, so many of the lessons haven&#x27;t carried over - how to manage complexity, the important of tooling, etc. But we&#x27;re making our way, bit by bit (or more recently, leap upon leap)<p>[1] I&#x27;m admittedly biased as I&#x27;ve put considerable amounts of effort into the project, and it&#x27;s not without its warts.

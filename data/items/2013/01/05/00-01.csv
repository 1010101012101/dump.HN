Sure, it stands out as the de facto file synchronization and cloud storage service in use today, but had the founders of Dropbox set out to merely improve on users' habits rather than reinvent them, their service would probably look like a fancy way to juggle the multitude of different versions of documents we used to have sitting around our harddrives and fileservers.<p>At times, usability improvements demand breaking with old paradigms.",1357347554

5010865,comment,5008047,5008047,1,0,zissou,,,"Two-sided markets and platform competition have been popular topics for microeconomic theorists since around the 2003 work of Rochet and Tirole[1] (IMHO, Tirole will win the Nobel Prize in the next 3 years). These two helped put together much of the generality left out of Baye and Morgan's 2000 paper[2] that looked at information gatekeepers on the Internet.<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, economists really began to look at the Internet (Hal Varian, Google's Chief Economist is probably the best example -- see his 1998 book ""Information Rules""[3]). They tried to tackle issues like price dispersion in a homogeneous goods market on the Internet (that is, why does price dispersion still exist in an Internet market for a homogeneous good?) and other problems of consumer information heterogeneity, consumer search, and so on. Starting in early 2000, economists began to take interest to the ""gatekeeper"" model of Internet prices -- a website that would aggregate prices across online retail sites. ""If a consumer just has to go to one site to become informed about all the prices in the market, then consumers can costlessly become informed about all the prices in the market by going to the gatekeepers site"" many microeconomists said. This led many researchers to look into the model of fees charged by gatekeepers to retailers who wanted to have their prices posted on the site.<p>Eventually, Tirole et al realized a way to generalize the concept of a two-sided market by describing it as a platform where the owner of the platform receives revenue from two [or more] sources (i.e. buyers via advertising and sellers via gatekeeper fees), hence making the general distinction between a multi-sided market and the the classic supply/demand market model. Today multi-sided markets are used to model almost all forms of platform competition.<p>From my perspective, research on the economics of the Internet hit a bit of a slump in the late 2000s as [too] many economists instead focused on macroeconomic issues during the bubble, but has grown in interest quite a bit again over the last 3-5 years with the rise of social networking and similar app/mobile platforms. So much of this research relies on fundamental models of two-sided markets, that I encourage anyone curious about really hot microeconomic theory topics related to the Internet and start-up industry to dig into platform competition.<p>[1] <i>Platform Competition in Two-Sided Markets</i>, <a href=""http://ideas.repec.org/p/ide/wpaper/654.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideas.repec.org/p/ide/wpaper/654.html</a><p>[2] <i>Information Gatekeepers on the Internet and the Competitiveness of Homogeneous Product Markets</i>, <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=215548"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=215548</a><p>[3] <i>Information Rules</i>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087584863X/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087584863X/</a>",1357347172

Parts of a program can be used as a template for creating other parts as needed. You can assemble these parts and shape the language into something very specific for the problem you are solving.<p>Other languages come part-way, but don't fully embrace this concept (code=data) because it has a cost: it seems difficult to learn because it requires a change in thinking; it seems difficult to write (and read) because you're directly encoding a data structure and it all looks a bit 'samey'. Where other languages have 'shapes' in their code that give the trained eye an indication of what the code is expressing (such as for...do loops and indentation), lisp code has one shape: a tree [1].<p>I don't know if I've reached beyond your understanding. I haven't meant to, but the takeaway should be this: lisp programs are self-aware and can operate on themselves because a lisp program is just data like any other.

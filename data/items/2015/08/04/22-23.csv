10006862,comment,10001866,10006631,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don&#x27;t think Google will be dead in the next few years.  I think it will be dead in about 15-20 (because that is the typical lifespan of a tech company - witness Sun, SGI, DEC, Apple if Steve Jobs had not returned, Compaq, Microsoft, and many others).  I also think that the average manager at Google will <i>never</i> reach Director, and indeed a SWE3 has a better chance of making Distinguished Engineer than a manager does of making Director.<p>The reason I believe this is simple numbers.  Assume a Director is responsible for a department of about 120; he has 5-6 direct reports (all managers), who average 2 managers and a handful of direct reports.  In total, the department has 15 managers, one director, and about 100 ICs.  In a steady-state company (one that is not growing, which I think will increasingly describe Google in the near future), the only way for an existing manager to get the director job is for the director to vacate it.  When will that happen?  The competition for the spots the director would want to move upwards into (VP positions) is just as tight, and they are often filled externally.  The competition for the CEO spot is non-existent; there is about zero chance that Larry will step down during his lifetime.  So every single manager has to wait for the Director to retire or leave the company, and even then, he has only 1/15 chance that he&#x27;ll be the one selected.<p>Things were different when Google was doubling in size every year; when a company grows that fast, it&#x27;s ready for a new level of management every 2-2.5 years, and instead of multiple people fighting for the same spot, <i>everybody</i> on the team could be made a manager and a new level of fresh recruits placed under them.<p>On the engineering ladder, at least, promotions are not zero-sum.  You can get promoted for building a system that has high impact, without having to displace anyone on the org chart.  The problem is that &quot;high impact&quot; is hard to define for promo committees, and so they often fall back on metrics they&#x27;re familiar with like &quot;number of people on the team&quot; when assessing promo cases.  But the number are not against you the way they are when climbing the management ladder.",1438729144

That means you never want to really run &#x27;apt-get install ...&#x27;, you want to add a package to your system by modifying your configuration file, and &#x27;rebuilding&#x27; your system. So the imperative &#x27;run commands to update OS&#x27; model that something like Ansible uses is obsoleted.<p>Because of this, if I have my laptop with a configuration file, and a backup of my data, I can basically reproduce my laptop on a brand new machine on the spot by A) copying config, B) &#x27;realizing&#x27; the configuration and rebuilding my OS based on it, C) restore data. Naturally, you normally just version control all these files, because your configuration <i>is</i> your specification of how to &#x27;create a system from scratch&#x27;. All I do is &#x27;git clone&#x27; onto a new device, run &#x27;nixos-rebuild&#x27; and my system is ready to go. I can deploy a live server after making sure the configuration is reboot/clean-start safe by testing it in a VM, and scp&#x27;ing it to a new server, etc.<p>Note that the same language, Nix, is used to A) describe how to build packages in a reproducible way, B) used to describe your OS configuration (NixOS), and C) is used to describe whole configuration networks, including things like EC2 configs (NixOps). Nix is also a programming language, not like YAML or a simple configuration language - so you also get a significant amount of reuse in code, and a drop in tool diversity/complexity from this. My NixOS configurations are very abstracted and reusable for multiple situations, they share configs where it makes sense, etc.<p>NixOS, at least, also has a concept of Linux containers that are specified declaratively in the same configuration file. This is why I mentioned libcontainer earlier - currently, NixOS spawns NixOS-based containers using systemd-nspawn. In theory we could probably replace this with Docker, but it&#x27;s not really a detail that the user is aware of - the actual underlying mechanics of the container engine are abstracted. Docker is useful as a development tool even on NixOS, but it&#x27;s not really what we need. We could maybe write something more sane by reusing some code from elsewhere.<p>Of course not everything is perfect. Docker has of course progressed very quickly for users since I last used it (very early releases that were promising but ultimately lacking in a lot of ways), but since using NixOS I have never looked back, because while it&#x27;s a tool that requires me to do a lot of work (which is not an exaggeration), it is one that actually allows me to move mountains, so to speak, and get my work done.",1438728014

To explain some differences, the Flash plugin is not bound to Web origins like NaCl plugins are, because Flash cannot strictly follow the Web origin model.

The message doesn&#x27;t really have to be &quot;interpreted&quot; in any meaningful way AFAIK. A message consists of a selector (essentially a method name) and a receiver, then whatever other arguments the method will take. The runtime looks up the selector in the receiver&#x27;s method table, much like with C++ virtual methods, and then jumps to the implementation it finds. There is a <i>little</i> more fanciness (some method caching, and support for nil receivers), but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s hugely dissimilar from virtual methods.<p>For anyone interested, here&#x27;s a good analysis of Objective-C&#x27;s message dispatch machinery: <a href=""http://blog.zhengdong.me/2013/07/18/a-look-under-the-hood-of-objc-msgsend"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.zhengdong.me/2013/07/18/a-look-under-the-hood-of...</a>",1438726064

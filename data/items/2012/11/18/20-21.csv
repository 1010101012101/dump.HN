More so, we know that the TSA has failed to stop several terrorist attacks which have only been foiled through other means. The shoe bomber, the underwear bomber, the Christmas Day Detroit attack. The TSA was powerless to stop these attacks. Instead, what has worked has been police work (both in the US and abroad) and passenger vigilance. It's possible that the TSA has deterred some attacks, but given how easy it is to get a bomb on an airplane despite the TSA it raises the question of whether it's worth the expense, the hassle, and the degradation of our civil liberties.",1353272384

4801643,comment,4801226,4801226,38,0,danilocampos,,,"Hey white dudes. I see you're pretty worked up. Non-white dude here to explain.<p>When you're white, and you're male, technology (as a career field) is pretty accessible. And here's why. You can open up a newspaper or a tech blog or whatever, and many of the major important people in the photos staring back at you <i>basically</i> look like you. And that's nice, because you can be reassured that someone with your background and origins <i>has a place in technology</i>.<p>If you're not male, or not white, you have to look a bit harder. Sometimes a lot harder, indeed, to find people who both look like you and are doing what you want to be doing professionally.<p>Now, you'll give me an argument that looks just shouldn't matter. That we should look at people's minds and ideas, not their skin color, in evaluating their contributions.<p>And while I'm sure such an ideal feels reassuring  it's bunk in this context.<p>Diversity of ""race"" is really a proxy for diversity of background, experience and origins. For maximizing the varieties of life story represented.<p>It's useful to do this because diversity of experience leads to diversity of solutions. Diversity also breeds further diversity, as people with wildly different backgrounds feel more welcome into the fold.<p>So when we see people helping to lead a community, and some of those people aren't like the majority, that's encouraging. It says that even though a given person is ""different"" from the norm, they are welcome, they may be successful.<p>Star Trek is lauded for this reason. Actor Nichelle Nichols was thinking of leaving the show. None other than Dr. Martin Luther King implored her to remain  he believed a black professional woman on television would be a crucial role model for young people.  (In her childhood, Whoopi Goldberg is said to have screamed, ""Hey Mom! Look! There's a black woman on the TV and she ain't no maid!"")<p>And you may argue, well, why should diversity matter? Let some people do some stuff and other people do others. And I'll tell you that position, on top of being lazy, opens us up to many missed opportunities. In technology, we want as many different sorts of humans as possible all working on our hard problems. If STEM is a country club for white guys, that leaves out a huge chunk of the population who might otherwise make great contributions.<p>One last thing. When you say stuff like ""Wull, shucks, what were they supposed to do? Find a token [non-white-male] to fill the spot?"" you make it sound like you don't believe there are any people <i>but</i> white guys with useful things to say on the subject of the conference.

4801605,comment,4801226,4801226,10,0,anonymous3821,,,"These HN comments are some of the most disconcerting that I've seen in a long time. The amount of ignorance displayed in some of them makes me--a white male--question this community. I could only imagine what message they would send to a minority.<p>Here's my take on a few comments in this thread. (I don't mean to single anyone out.)<p>>>Imagine if people were criticizing a lineup because there were too many women.<p>If our society treated males and females equally, then this hypothetical would make sense. But in a society where females face discrimination their entire lives and barriers can often prevent from reaching their potential, I think such a hypothetical is silly to bring up.<p><i>It is everyone's responsibility to try to adjust for this inequality in society.</i> That might include going out of your way as a conference organizer to encourage more qualified minorities to apply as speakers. As some HN'ers have brought up, quality will not be jeopardized in the process.<p>>>To pick out a single conference in our industry with this property is textbook selection bias [1] and doesn't demonstrate any kind of discrimination at all.<p>If you notice, no one (as far as I can tell) explicitly called this discrimination. There will always be people who question the validity of things like these, and why shouldn't there be? Conferences, if they did their share of work, should be able to hold up against arguments like these (if they're invalid).<p>Yes, statistically some conferences might have gone out of their way to find minorities and failed to do so. Looking at any single case, though, such a scenario is unlikely. One should not just say, ""Oh, statistics show that this might happen by chance, and therefore <i>no one</i> should question the validity of the selection process.""<p>>>The problem is statistics. If there are only a few women who are applicable - simply due to the sad fact that there are so few women in the field - then there will be a lot of conference where random selection will mean there are no women in the lineup.<p>Like before, <i>the problem cannot be blamed on statistics.</i> I don't believe that there will be a <i>lot of</i> conferences where no qualified women could present at. If they couldn't be found, I'm guessing that--most of the times--the organizers didn't look hard enough. This is just a guess, but I'm not going to assume the utopian society that others on this page have and say that everyone tries their hardest to attain diversity.<p>>> Dear God! As if it wasn't hard enough to arrange a conference, apparently you have to make sure to invite every minority as a speaker at that conference too.<p>Misunderstanding the issue at hand and making outrageous claims like these <i>does not</i> improve my opinion of HN.<p>>> I really hope the responsible <i>trolls</i>... [emphasis added]<p>Enough said. Calling people who raise valid concerns <i>trolls</i> (or <i>muppets</i>, like someone else did) is not respectful. The fact that such an ad-hominem attack on HN got upvoted to the top is shocking.<p>>>Why should that have been their goal? This isn't a conference about racial issues or gender issues.<p>Taken from the BritRuby's website:<p><pre><code>  Our mission statement was to encourage Ruby developers to unite and\n  create a community, which would allow such to network, exchange ideas\n  and provoke innovation for the future of Ruby.\n</code></pre>\nBritain has 51% women. Women are underrepresented in the Ruby community, but there is no reason why it should stay like that. Is not anyone's job to increase the percentage of female coders. It is <i>everyone's</i>.<p>HN user <i>luigi</i> says it better than I ever could:<p><pre><code>  The act of organizing a conference makes one a leader for their\n  technical community. We all know we have a diversity problem.\n  And conference organizers are responsible for helping address\n  that problem.

I hope people take the time to read it before responding, because this issue comes up <i>a lot</i> in many walks of life, and there's no easy answer.<p>I spend some of my free time doing international recruitment for my alma matter. One question I get asked occasionally is about affirmative action, which is effectively what we're talking about here. To be honest, I don't find the post-mortem being linked to particularly productive or helpful: if anything, it shows a lack of empathy:<p>> ""It doesn't matter who speaks at a conference, as long as they're capable, interesting and relevant. That's what matters: content, not style""<p>This is a frequently made argument against affirmative action. It's based upon the assumption that the <i>only</i> purpose of college (or, in this case, a conference) is to learn. However, that's not true. Conferences provide social opportunities, and a chance to interact with your peer group. Some people argue conferences are primarily networking opportunities first, learning second.<p>Because of this, you ideally want to attract as wide a group as possible. Organizers can attract this wide base by providing a diverse group of speakers.<p>There have been in the past several posts here on HN about women being treated very badly at conferences. We know that sexism (and racism) can and does happen. Ensuring that your conference audience is diverse can help mitigate this. To have a diverse audience you need to consider what barriers might exist: perhaps an all-male caucasian panel is one such barrier.<p>> ""Turns out, a lot of the famous Rubyists are white guys and all of the ones who said they'd like to come were, indeed, white guys.""<p>This may well be true. But perhaps the pool of speakers was rather self selecting. Colleges like the one I went to spend a considerable amount of time and money actively engaging with minority groups, because those minorities might not otherwise consider applying. The same is true for conferences.<p>If you're organising a conference, or any public event, you need to be aware of these. In the UK you're required by law to have a disability access policy for your public event: why not spend the time to put together a diversity policy as well?<p>This whole situation is very sad. I don't think the conference should have been cancelled. People could have approached the organisers with their concerns in private first - it doesn't look as if this happened. Stuff snowballs on Twitter. Nobody comes out smelling of roses here.<p>However, it does also seem that the conference organisers didn't give particular thought to diversity at their event. The bottom line is these are very sensitive issues. There is no right answer. This sounds like a cop out, but it's true: if affirmative action has taught us anything it's that <i>somebody</i> will be unhappy with whatever approach you take. That somebody may not always be morally or ethically right, but they will be vocal.",1353269873

A quick summary:<p>If you think statistics is a big toolbox, some of the tools give different answers that are better or worse in various ways, and you can just take out whatever tool you like, you're a frequentist.<p>If you think that there's such a thing as a correct probability estimate, and all coherent reasoning is required to come up with consistent answers regardless of which different path was taken to arrive at the same destination, you're a Bayesian.  From this perspective, a ""confidence interval"" isn't a tool that's useful on some occasions, it's just plain crazy and wrong, like a weather forecaster who only tells you the probability that it's raining here <i>xor</i> in Narnia.  Sure, the forecast is generated by a process that's sorta related to the correct answer, but by manipulating the imaginary land of Narnia you can make the forecast be basically anything.  With Bayesianism there are no degrees of freedom in the likelihood ratio you report. See <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1132/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/1132/</a>.<p>It doesn't do any good to appeal to the idea that Bayesian methods are just one tool in the toolbox.

Adding a token minority speaker is offensive to that speaker, it says ""You're here because you tick a box - not because you're skilled."" It doesn't matter who speaks at a conference, as long as they're capable, interesting and relevant. That's what matters: content, not style.</i><p>The second point is a strawman argument (and doesn't reflect well on the OP, unfortunately). Unless the detractors were complete reprobates, I doubt their reasoning was ""You guys should include a non-white female for balance's sake!"" I would hope that the line of allegation (and maybe it got muddled up in tweets, as oft is the case) was: you guys did not look hard enough to find alternative viewpoints, or: you guys have a narrow viewpoint on what makes for an interesting Rubyist.<p>Which brings me to point 1: Ruby was invented by a Japanese national. And last time the the Ruby 2.0 announcements were posted on HN, it was in Japanese. So in terms of pure white vs. non-whites, you most definitely can't say that all of the pioneers in Ruby are white, as you might be able to with other languages.<p>That said, I don't think (again I was only playing devil's advocate) that the organizers' intentions were bad. It's within the realm of possibility that every ""minority"" candidate they wanted could not make the conference. Yet it's also possible the organizers have a mostly-white circle, and without prodding, are prone to select from that group...not because they're racist, but because they happen to follow these people more and thus are more aware of their achievements. That most of these people are white males is a <i>symptom</i> of this natural tendency to look within your clique, without racism playing any influence at all.<p>Case in point: if you asked me to assemble a panel of top Rubyists and if I were unaware of the language's origins...I would most likely pick mostly white males and no Japanese at all. Not because I'm racist against Japanese (FWIW, I'm Asian), but because I don't speak/read Japanese, have never been to Japan, have never met other Japanese rubyists...and thus their accomplishments don't even enter my head when brainstorming top rubyists because I'm just unaware of their existence.<p>In that case, I'd welcome people to call me out for not ever looking up who this ""Matz"" character is. But I'd still probably be insulted if someone just called me a racist. So maybe in the OP's case, it's true that their circle is not large enough...and yet it's not right at all to just call them racist/sexist. The end result, I'm afraid, is that despite the well-meaning parties in this fight, the problem and problematic judgment of ""tokenism"" will just increase.<p>* One more point: The OP says:<p>> <i>Please: think before you speak. Investigate before you judge. And look beneath the surface before you retweet.</i><p>I'm not going to argue whether it's fair or not to expect this: but if an organizer is facing these kinds of allegations, then they can help alleviate the issue by writing a substantial post on their criteria for selecting the speakers and some examples of people they asked but who could not make it. If all outsiders see is the list of speakers as it stands, then they have to give the organizers the benefit of the doubt...which is not always going to happen...",1353269505

4801466,comment,4795668,4796589,1,0,beatgammit,,,"I have so far successfully avoided Perl, but I have programmed a little in Python. I completely understand those statements, and I can make guesses about difference in some corner cases. I think it's relatively common to know what those statements mean. I agree that a programmer that doesn't know how variables are passed probably doesn't understand the language.<p>I don't agree with the conclusion though. I think that a programmer ""knows"" a language if he/she understands the idiomatic way of representing an idea. For example, if a functional language programmer comes to C, perhaps he/she might write a summing function this way:<p><pre><code>    int sum(int* arr, int count) {\n        if (count == 0) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n        return *arr + res(arr++, count--);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd an assembly programmer might do it this way:<p><pre><code>    int sum(int* arr, int count) {\n        int sum = 0;\n        int i = 0;\n        loop:\n        if (i == count)\n            return sum;\n\n        sum += arr[i];\n        i++;\n        goto loop;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNeither are writing idiomatic C code, but both show they know different corners of the syntax. I would argue that one does not ""know"" a language until their first reflex in solving a problem is to write it the most idiomatic way for that language.<p>When I write code in a language, I try to follow the idioms of that language:<p>* Go: multiple return values and interfaces<p>* Java: small, polymorphic classes with tons of getters and setters<p>* Javascript: prototypes, callbacks and array methods<p>* Python: list comprehensions, generators, and tuples<p>* D: templates, ""auto"" and parameter storage classes (in, out, ref, inout)<p>A programmer doesn't have to know the nitty gritty details of a language to ""know"" the language. I think the programmer can omit omit learning crazy #define macro foo, the ""comma"" operator, type coercion rules, bit alignment in structs (for cheap struct serialization) and the like and still ""know"" the language. Conversely, the more of these details you know, the more likely it is that you won't write idiomatic code. If you know, for example, that x << 0 is faster than parseInt(i, 10) is faster in Javascript, you'll tend to use that more often than the more idiomatic way. This is an implementation detail and shows that you don't understand the idiomatic way of writing Javascript code.<p>I use a language depending on the problem domain. Some languages lend themselves to certain problems better than others. I don't, however, know the implementation details that only a compiler designer should know, but I don't feel that precludes me from ""knowing"" a language.",1353269366

No observable performance degradation.<p>2) Report the problem to the user when it is found.<p>3) Mark the page as faked up and don't use it, ever.<p>So you have memory tested basically for free, users aware of their hardware errors, and a lot less consequences for those errors.",1353268845

And that there&#x27;s a population for whom none of the self-discipline methods are going to work in the long term (I&#x27;ve been around women who had an amazing difficultly in taking the pill every day...).<p>Then there&#x27;s the confounding factor of the backstops, the &quot;morning after&quot; medicines and abortion, with the further confounding factor of cultural acceptance of them.  I&#x27;ve read that there&#x27;s almost no stigma associated with abortion in Japan, which I connect with another thing I&#x27;ve read, that a baby isn&#x27;t considered to be ... real?, really counted as alive in some sense, until it survives for 3 days.  Which helps deal with the high natural mortality rate right after birth.<p>Which needs to be remembered when you e.g. try to compare life expectancy rates between countries, since infant mortality is such a major factor in that, and countries vary <i>wildly</i> in how they score it.  E.g. the US tries <i>very</i> hard, much harder than most counties, to save preemies and those with birth defects, whereas the latter are unlikely to ever exit the neonatal unit alive in the PRC (something that came up in discussion of the couple in Armenia where it&#x27;s claimed the mother gave the father of their newborn son with Downs Syndrome the ultimatum of divorce if he wanted to keep the child, one pretty clear implication being he would be killed if not).",1424008151

Asimov used the analogy of a gas: in a gas, the motion of a single molecule is very difficult to predict, but the mass action of the gas can be predicted to a high level of accuracy. Asimov applied this concept to the population of the fictional Galactic Empire, which numbered in the quadrillions.&quot; http://goo.gl/09ypYw<p>Asimov&#x27;s psychohistory is based on the following assumptions:<p><i>- The population under scrutiny is oblivious to the existence of the science of Psychohistory.<p>- The time periods dealt with are in the region of 3 generations.<p>- The population must be in the billions for a statistical probability to have a psychohistorical validity.<p>- That human reactions to stimuli would remain constant.</i><p>Given a sufficiently large population, will psychohistory ever become reality?",1424006668

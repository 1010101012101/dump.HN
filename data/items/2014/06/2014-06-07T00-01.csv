7860905,comment,7856474,7856969,1,0,hyperion2010,,,"So LTP is generally thought to be mediated by an increase in the number of AMPA receptors at a synapse. There have also been studies showing that the size of spines is correlated with the number of AMPArs present at the synapse. Whether LTP actually induces the formation of more spines is not entirely clear. The general answer is &#x27;we think the processes are probably related&#x27; but it is difficult to do the experiments needed to show that the in vivo correlates of LTP actually cause increased spine formation as part of their downstream signaling pathways. It is worth noting that most of our knowledge about LTP comes from studies in the hippocampus and that the relation between spine formation and LTP may vary from brain region to brain region and even from cell type to cell type.<p>tl;dr It is hypothesized that increased numbers of spines is a later stage of the process of memory consolidation that may initially appear as LTP however we need a whole lot more evidence to support those hypotheses.",1402102532

In .net however, you also have the following methods: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/75x4ha6s(v=vs.100).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/75x4ha6s(v=v...</a><p>Most of which are commonly abused because developers don&#x27;t know what they are doing with what, when. For instance I&#x27;ve never seen profiles used, and as much as I&#x27;d like to at-least try the idea, any attempt to move even non-critical information into profiles is met with heavy resistance as it&#x27;s something &#x27;we just haven&#x27;t used before&#x27;.<p>One place I was hired at (thankfully to clean up some of the mess), insisted on using query-strings and hidden fields for just about everything-they had no idea of the proper way to handle things. When they did use session variables they would attempt some increment magic and mess it up so it was possible to get everything out of sync and be returning the wrong data. They made no use of Application Settings and instead used a physical control file to hard-code global variables to be used across the site.<p>Part of my experience and hate for .net is specific to instances I&#x27;ve seen-I will agree to that point, but so much just has to do with developers who use &#x27;whatever works&#x27; instead of thinking about the underlying design implications of their application. I really just believe its because they don&#x27;t take the time to learn what is happening &#x27;underneath the hood&#x27;. The thing is, the more I work within the .net environment, it really is apparent at just how EASY it is to forget the fundamentals, to throw some tool or easy solution at something, rather then having to think it out. It&#x27;s great that development time feels quick but can also feel a bit dumbing-down as-well.<p>I&#x27;m rambling so I&#x27;m going to shut up. :)",1402101729

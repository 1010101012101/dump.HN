4061070,comment,4059356,4060071,4,0,dreiss,,,"If your object is in a vector, it's already possible for the vector to move the object without updating any pointers to it.  The only question is whether it is safe for the vector to move the object with memmove instead of invoking a copy/move constructor, essentially skipping the step of telling the object that it is being moved.  This will only fail if the object contains pointers to its own sub-objects (or the move constructor updates external pointers).  This is fairly rare, especially for objects that you would store directly in a vector.<p>std::string is a key exception to this, but fbstring is not.",1338738980

At the cost of an unpredictable, slower schedule, I am able to extract very high quality output, across a wide variety of projects and interests. This combination of depth and breadth also sometimes allows connections to be made across fields, leading to possible value multipliers. And since the only constraint in the system is ""until bored"", it acts as an optimal Attention to Value Conversion Machine (AVCM).",1338738369

Like Joel Spolsky said, and like I know from personal experience, my best developer friends aren't in the market salivating to take interview tests, and do code sprints to prove they are good.  They are passionate about developing, have many great jobs to pick from at a given time if they tried. If they have free time, they would rather put it on an open source project that excites them, or a smartphone/web app that they are making for themselves.<p>If you look at filtering mechanisms themselves, there are companies that try to have puzzles that they ask you to solve before joining (eg: ITA software).  But they are really challenging puzzles that I would solve just for fun anyway, (which is what I did for months till I one day decided to apply for a job there).  The fact that these puzzles are also made by the company (and not a third party website) makes a difference.  It tells me about the people that work there and potentially about their culture.  On the other hand, building a random web app to prove basic skills is not something I would imagine most talented web developers would like to do anyway.<p>If you look at it from the perspective of a company that is hiring, tools like this solve merely one part of the puzzle.  It takes the subset of developers who are already in the market for a new job and filters them.  As a startup though, what I want to do is lure the great engineers who are content at their regular jobs and not looking at all because of inertia. It sounds like there is more of a ""search for developers"" problem that will expand the breadth of all the developers available to me, instead of focusing on the ones who are already out there (and are most likely not the cream of the crop by definition).<p>In short, I don't mean to be negative, and am not saying that there might not be a market for a tool like this.  But I am pretty certain that if you are a great developer, you don't have an incentive to make a web app on this.",1338738220

The people who can least afford the disposable income that should allow for engaging in such a statistically unlikely reward are the ones who far and away spend the most on it.  The lottery increases the prosperity gap in this country, and the very institution that should be decreasing that gap (the government) acts to increase it.<p>Is free access of net benefit or detriment?  I think we should put assumptions aside and evaluate that question carefully.  Once the government takes action, it rarely pulls back -- even in the face of overwhelming evidence that it's doing more harm than good.

They can be tween girls or seasoned engineers or perhaps people in certain moods (e.g. pornography, games)<p>The restrictions are the limitations from being say admin or god on the site. Can someone delete others content without any recourse, record or undo? Can they masquerade themselves as someone else?  Just what are they permitted to get away with?<p>The structure is the purpose and intent of the usage of the site. Is there a forum for user contribution? Is there a place, say on think geek for user photos of products?<p>I think a model with retention and growth must somehow balance the users it's attracting, the restrictions they are given, and the structures of creation they can employ. \nTogether these form a social product.<p>I dont think its necessarily important to get these right at first blush as much as it is important to know what part you are lacking and what direction you need to turn to based on whats going on.<p>It has to be reactive (or perhaps, adaptive).

For some A/B tests, split the users into two groups. Treatment A is A/B testing, treatment B is UCB.<p>In A/B testing, follow appropriate A/B testing procedures: Pick a sample size prior to the experiment that gives you appropriate power, or use Armitage's rule for optimal test termination. (Email me if you're interested, I'm happy to send over papers/scan relevant pages from his book). However , it's probably best to use a fixed sample size, as that is what most real life A/B test practitioners use. Picking the sample size can be a bit tricky, but as a rule of thumb, pick something that is large in enough to dectect differences in treatments as small as 1%age point.<p>In the treatment group B, use the UCB1 procedure. Subject the users to whichever design UCB1 picks, and continue with the learning.<p>Do not share any information between treatment groups A and B.<p>Run these tests for a sufficient amount of time over a largish number of clients, and then use permutation tests to determine which treatment, UCB1 vs Neyman-Pearson, performs better.<p>In all the simulations I've seen, UCB performs simple A/B testing, but it would be great to see some empirical evidence as well.",1338736509

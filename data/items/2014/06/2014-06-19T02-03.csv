7914171,comment,7913435,7913705,1,0,dylukes,,,"I disagree. Unit and feature testing are vastly overrated for what they do, and their current use is faddishly subscribed to in a seemingly cult like fashion. Unit tests are excellent for testing non-stateful behavior of code. That is, they&#x27;re great for testing contracts, and they have a bit more flexibility than Eiffel style contracts. However, using them to the extent of &quot;returns an Object of this type&quot; is absurdly verbose and pollutes the code base with roundabout information.<p>These sorts of things are best left to a static type system, which is a more specialized and effective system for that portion of validating your code. On the other end of things, tests of more stateful processes or behaviors are better served by E2E testing.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with using multiple forms of testing. Different tools excel at testing different sorts of things.",1403146791
7914170,comment,7914028,7914028,6,0,remar,,,"Speaking from my experience as an intern at Microsoft, I really wish there was more focus on training. I&#x27;ve heard from a lot of praise about the quality of codelabs from friends at Google and never received anything like that when I was working. I was basically just given a project and expected to pick up things by asking people or reading some half-outdated sharepoint pages.<p>From speaking with other interns it seems their experiences varied entirely based on their teams. The impression I got was that it was really fragmented across teams and that each team felt like it had its own way of doing things.<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure how it is at Google but I&#x27;ve heard from a friend that the entire company works on a single shared codebase. The project I was working on had 3 different forks of the framework I was developing (that I knew of), each maintained by different teams. Basically, the impression I got was that everything just felt really fragmented and that I was only working with my team rather than with an entire company.<p>I should mention that this was my 2nd software development job ever so maybe this is normal for lots of companies and that Google is one of the few companies doing it right, but the experience didn&#x27;t really leave me with lots of confidence in the engineering environment/culture of the company.<p>I&#x27;ve heard tons of good things about the engineering culture at Google so I&#x27;m considering if I should try applying there.",1403146760

They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.<p>You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.<p>Fuck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.<p>You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you.

You could earn serious cold cash with that finding.<p>For one thing, the IDEA implementation seems to be incorrect. In IDEA, multiplication is defined as multiplication modulo 2^16 + 1, where 0 means 2^16 [3]. However, looking at the multiplication function:<p><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/end-to-end/source/browse/javascript/crypto/e2e/cipher/idea.js#312"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/end-to-end/source/browse/javascrip...</a><p>When x == 0 but y != 0, the result of the modular multiplication is always 0, when it should not be. The correct code would be (in glorious C syntax, everything unsigned and 32-bit):<p><pre><code>    if(x != 0) {\n        if(y != 0) {\n            return x*y % 65537; // result fits in 32 bits\n        }\n        else return 65537 - x; // or 1 - x mod 2^16\n    } else return 65537 - y; // or 1 - y mod 2^16\n</code></pre>\nOf course, even if correct this code is still vulnerable to timing attacks (under contrived conditions) [1]. This can be worked around using a little bitwise magic:<p><pre><code>    t0  = 65537 - x;\n    t1  = 65537 - y;\n    t2  = x*y % 65537;\n    b0  = -(1 ^ ((x | -x) >> 31)); // 0xfff..ff if x == 0\n    b1  = -(1 ^ ((y | -y) >> 31)); // 0xfff..ff if y == 0\n    return ((t0&~b0&b1) | (t1&b0&~b1) | (t2&~b0&~b1) | (1&b0&b1))&0xFFFF;\n</code></pre>\nAdditionally, the modular inversion seems to be needlessly complicated by using Euclid&#x27;s algorithm (and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s correct either: it seems not to respect the &quot;0 means 2^16&quot; rule). Use the usual a^(p-2) mod p inversion trick, using an optimal addition chain [2], to make it simpler, constant-time, and possibly faster.<p>None of this is Javascript&#x27;s fault, for what it&#x27;s worth. But I certainly don&#x27;t expect Javascript to make it any easier to write correct code, much by the contrary.<p>EDIT: Fixed constant-time code.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/paper-side-channel2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/paper-side-channel2.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/achim/script_lookup_ac?para=FIXED"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/achim/scrip...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.isiweb.ee.ethz.ch/papers/arch/xlai-mass-inspec-1991-2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isiweb.ee.ethz.ch/papers/arch/xlai-mass-inspec-19...</a>",1403145720

When we split off to form egcs the main resistance was to the idea that there would be a fork at all.  Gcc, and a bunch of other programs, had a single person who controlled the &quot;official&quot; release.  The fact that Cygnus maintained its own release tree for its customers (it was still free -- it simply wasn&#x27;t identical to the mainline, and in fact advanced a lot faster) was the cause of much angst and even some mistrust.<p>My reason for making this fork was because the mainline was so far behind us, and we had a commitment to folding all our changes back into the main line.  Since the gcc maintainer was the bottleneck, we simply declared our tree a new fork with the support and participation of other major developers.  We were trying to be the opposite of exclusivist.  But even so it took me months of mailing, calling and negotiating.  Many hours on the phone with rms who of course predicted the doom of free software if we went ahead.<p>And we developed a steering committee, the first as far as I know for a free software project.<p>In those two ways egcs was a watershed; plenty of developers thankfully now know no other way.<p>So last year glibc went the opposite way: it decided it no longer needed a steering committee.

I&#x27;ve not written much Scala, but I&#x27;ve already encountered numerous bugs that resulted from some library returning an unexpected null, and the type system decided that was totally fine.",1403143535

7914032,comment,7913413,7913681,2,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> I see tons of start-ups that would have a fighting chance given that sort of investment and then lame stuff like this gets funding.<p>What makes you think this is an either-or proposition? There&#x27;s a glut of capital chasing startup opportunities today. No entrepreneur is entitled to money, but <i>every</i> entrepreneur can compete for it. Sure, some entrepreneurs are better connected than others, which often makes fundraising easier. But at the end of the day, why should investors be implicitly blamed for a failed startup led by an entrepreneur who was unable to convince said investors to provide his or her company with funding?<p>Sales is an integral part of building a successful business, and if you need capital, you had better be prepared to sell your company to the people you&#x27;re asking to provide it.<p>> Congratulations to the Yo team for furthering the research to the origins of the term &#x27;dumb money&#x27;.<p>Even if you subscribe to the notion that there really is &quot;smart money&quot; and &quot;dumb money&quot; when it comes to angels and venture firms, let&#x27;s not pretend that there isn&#x27;t such a thing as &quot;dumb entrepreneurship.&quot; Entrepreneurs who start businesses without lining up the capital they need to execute are taking a risk. In many cases, especially among young entrepreneurs, that risk is not at all calculated.<p>On this note, it&#x27;s sad that so many startup entrepreneurs bet the farm on day one by putting themselves in a position where they believe they need to sell equity to raise capital. There are a variety of ways to fund a business and early on, selling equity is often one of the least attractive despite the sex appeal that Silicon Valley has given it.",1403143397

It&#x27;s a multi-driver, differential bus with 3 valid states (not including bus arbitration). It does all sorts of dirty things, like in order to identify a device as a USB1.0 or USB1.1 device, a resistor is either applied to D- or D+. In order to determine if the host/device should switch to USB2.0 mode, the host computer will drive both lines to low (SE0) and the device will send high current &quot;chirps&quot; back to the host. Essentially having multiple hosts driving the line at the same time.<p><a href=""http://www.usbmadesimple.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usbmadesimple.co.uk/</a>",1403143319

Presumably Google will put a positive spin on anything they do, and make the arguments that are best received by the public, not the most logical arguments.<p>>I&#x27;m sure it was important to the people working there.<p>Switching from supplier A to supplier B will always be bad for supplier A.

Of course, this completely misses the point of checking the answer.

If I was making a language - and I could do as I wanted - I would make try to make the compilation step fully &quot;debuggable&quot;, ie being able to step through the whole compilation, even stop and modify things, mess around, etc. Compilers seem awfully black-boxy, in general.<p>(Forth might be one of the ultimate expressions of the principle of a fully understandable compiler - Chuck Moore even hesitates to call it a compiler.)<p>On the other hand, you can get very far without really losing anything if you just know the semantics of the language, and leave the nitty-gritty to the compiler. C is supposed to be simple, but given how big of a deal optimizing compilers for C seems to be, it&#x27;s not straightforward to make a proper, industrial standard compiler for the language (perhaps both with regards to competition and effort). And yet C is supposedly just a thinly-veiled abstraction over assembly (&quot;supposedly&quot; since I&#x27;m not a C programmer).<p>I for one welcome giant, too-big-to-understand-for-one-person compilers, as long as they are awesome at what they do. Simple programming language? Then you seem to get complicated design patterns. Simple semantics ala &quot;everything is X&quot; (immutable, object, ...)? Then you get complicated work-around in the places where you can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t want immutability/objects... . Simple compiler? Lot&#x27;s of responsibility and mental overhead for each individual programmer, in a sense duplicating a lot of the effort that could be handled by a team of compiler writers, once.",1401575612
7827493,comment,7826175,7826887,1,0,tomp,,,"In theory, it would be quite complex, as is every refactoring of existing code. I imagine that if all the primitive functions (e.g. memcpy, malloc, etc.) would be annotated with contracts, the system could pinpoint all the places that need proof. However, most functions would need annotations; refined type inference would help with this (like [1], [2] and [3]), but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s advanced enough already.<p>In practice, this experiment isn&#x27;t powerful enough for this. To support C, the refined type-checker would have to know how to reason about mutable state, and unless pointers are severely restricted, they would always enable an escape hatch (for the sloppy or rogue programmer). Projects that would help are Cyclone (an attempt at memory-safe C), Rust and VCC [4] (which, however, is focused at concurrency). Altogether, it would be much easier to start with a safer language and design for memory safety and/or verified contracts from the ground up.",1401575576

We are at Santa Monica and Westwood and a cop car pulls up right next to me. I&#x27;m higher up, and this light takes a long time, so I get a good long chance to view the cop car over.<p>I was surprised. The damn thing was rusted to all hell. There was a thermal scanner on the top, but good lord if it actually worked. Most of the BNC cables (yes, really, like in freshman lab) were frayed up. The top was totally rust, and a bit of liner was coming through. Remember, in SoCal, we get rain maybe 5 times a year. This car was OLD.<p>The thing about LA cops is that they are sensible and responding to incentives correctly. The LA basin is gigantic and they have to patrol all of it. Add in the low taxes for police support, and you get the main problem of a street officer: Backup is 25 minutes away. It&#x27;s just you and your partner most of the time. This, above all else, explains the LAPD.<p>The US Army ran into a similar problem in Iraq right after the fall. We became the police, effectively. Problem was, just like in LA, the area was too big for the force size. All small houses, all just sprawl, no back-up. Things started out just the same as in LA. You are FORCED, in order to protect yourselves, to be the Biggest Badass all around. You must culture a sense in the populace that you DO NOT FUCK WITH the US Army. Brutality is necessary. This is what the LAPD is doing, and it makes sense.<p>Thing is, Iraq taught us a lot about COIN, COunter INsurgency. What the army ended up doing, and it was much more successful, was you deputize the local leaders. Make them hash things out among themselves. Only call the Army when you really need them. They do not become a patrol force, but a real big hammer that whomps on things. Patrols are the job of local deputies.<p>The LAPD, being in California, cannot do this. The legal system here in the states will not allow for local deputations of people in Compton and Koreatown. Just from a benefits and payment perspective alone you can&#x27;t do this.<p>So, the LAPD is doing the best it can to stay alive, which is the situation the taxpayers of LA county have put them in. You want less drones and a better police force in LA? Pay them more to get more people on the streets. Give them back-up. Then they won&#x27;t be so brutal, because they won&#x27;t be alone. Otherwise, drones and the like are here to stay",1401575260

If those fields were in the visible, as they are for some fiber, then folks would talk about the speed of light in the coax.  Since they are not in the visible, we talk about the speed of the TEM mode instead.<p>EDIT:  Some other folks are pointing out that the speed of propagation in coax is about 2/3 the speed of light.  This has nothing to do with the velocity of electrons in the metal.<p>Most coax has a central conductor, an insulator (made of teflon PTFE), and a outer conductor (the shield).  The speed is almost entirely determined by the index-of-refraction of the teflon, which is approximately 1.5.  The propagation speed is 1/index (approximately), so the the reciprocal of 3/2 gets you to 2/3.",1401573855

The purpose of this is to gather a few independent opinions. You might be asked to write code, you might be asked to sketch architecture, you might be asked to tell war stories.<p>Try to stay relaxed, be candid, and take a break/drink/use the restroom between interviewers. Try to start with a blank state, mentally, for each round. Also, bear in mind that if you&#x27;re breezing through the interview, people will often start asking tougher questions to try and figure out where your limits are. If, by the halfway mark, you&#x27;re being asked things you don&#x27;t know the answer to, that does not mean you&#x27;re failing. (Avoid bullshitting if you reach this point, it&#x27;ll be obvious and count against you, it&#x27;s worse than just saying you don&#x27;t know)",1401573855

Things like fizzbuzz, quickly followed by how you&#x27;d do an in-place string reversal, followed by whether you&#x27;d use quicksort vs mergesort for something.  Personally, I don&#x27;t see a huge point in too many maths-based questions because Google, so it&#x27;s a litmus test and not a skills test IMO.<p>Then there are language and framework related questions - maybe you&#x27;ll get shown some complexish code and be asked to spot the bugs.  Or you&#x27;ll get asked how, in practical terms, you&#x27;d go about achieving something (with which library would you be working).  This would also go over the technologies and skills you might actually need to have to do your job at the company.<p>To see the cultural fit, they might ask about a project that interested you, and why it interested you.  I come from a government town, so this question winds up being pretty awkward, but a lack of passion and enthusiasm is something that I&#x27;ve seen technically-relatively-competent people turned down for.<p>At a higher level, there&#x27;s things like &quot;say we wanted to create a link shortener, how would you go about implementing it?&quot; and the follow ups on scaling and asynchronous processing (&quot;what about analytics?&quot; etc.)  Stuff which gets you talking in terms of the components and how they&#x27;d interact in terms of queueing, designing for reliability etc etc.  These types of problems really have no wrong answer, and you can learn a lot about how the developer thinks, their areas of interest, and whether they&#x27;d be a good fit for the team without ever getting them stuck on a problem.<p>At the end of the day, I haven&#x27;t asked/been asked, questions that are that different from those that you&#x27;d ask a junior or intermediate interviewee, it&#x27;s the detail and quality of the response that you expect to be different.<p>That said, with 3 hours, they&#x27;ll probably have the interview and then get you to code something.",1401573828

It will need some work first.<p>The user interaction will be confusing to many. Legends, instructions, and a general UI cleanup will help lots. Another thing to consider is adding more search parameters (year, model, price range, body style, location, source, etc.). I'm sure you've already got all of this in the development pipeline.<p>If you gave this a little polish and its own memorable domain name, I would almost certainly use this tool to research my next car. Also, car buyers are a significant demographic to car manufacturers. I could see this being a valuable resources for buyers and sellers (of new cars) alike.",1313438376

Or Apple banning apps from the app store then copying their functionality into their own software.<p>I don't know if Google has done or does anything like that, and that is why people tend to think they're 'better' than other companies.<p>Therefore by evil what is meant is the company using slimy underhanded tactics on competitors or customers (such companies usually use them on both).

I suspect this tax-efficiency of scale is a significant reason for why you end up with huge corporations in such industries (oil and gas, minerals).

What the author describes as technical debt is good muju, and a ""mess"" is bad muju.<p>I believe in the same good muju / bad muju concepts. The only difference is that I use the term ""technical debt"" to refer to both of them.  While the author only uses technical debt as a non-pejorative term, I use it as both a pejorative and non-pejorative term.<p>For me, the analogy of debt still works -- its all a matter of how responsible you spend the money.  Take a home equity loan as an example.  Spending it on renovating the bathroom and kitchen is (at least historically) likely to be a positive ROI.  That's good muju (the author would say ""technical debt"", I would say ""good technical debt"").  Spending it on a new sports car would be bad muju (the author would say ""a mess"", I would say ""bad technical debt"").",1313437302

Capital investment is affected daily by economic growth, interest rates, investor confidence, and a large number of other factors.  Buffett points out in his OpEd that when capital gains tax were much higher in the past than they are currently, economic growth was higher than it is now.  This implies that higher capital gains results in more effective investment.

8010328,comment,8009333,8010085,8,0,p4bl0,,,"Of course, the &quot;impact factor&quot; of the journal also counts, however it is gamed too. For instance there are publishers which artificially increase the impact factors of their journals by requesting that authors of accepted papers cite a few articles recently published in their journal.<p>Now, I would like to come back to the &quot;article&quot; you cite. Let me get this straight from the beginning: this text (by John Bohannon) is a piece of shit. Let me explain why:<p>The article aim to compare open access journals and closed access ones.\nThe method that is used for that purpose is quite remarkable.\nIt consists in sending a paper of very poor quality with wrong results in it to many <i>gold</i> open access journals (this means that there are what is called &quot;Author Processing Charge&quot;: the authors pay the journal to publish), and to see how many of those will accept the paper.\nWhat happens is that a bit more than half of them accept the paper with, of course, not a single sign of peer-review happening.\nThe author then conclude that open access journals are for the major part of poor quality, implying that they are worse than &quot;traditional journals&quot;.\nThis conclusion is eminently ridiculous.<p>First, if you want to compare open access and closed access journals, you also need to actually test the closed access journals.\nYou can&#x27;t just assume that they are good, especially when it&#x27;s implied and not a single reason to think so is given (trust me it could be hard in many cases).<p>Second, the method makes no sense. No researchers sends his or her paper to unknown journals.\nWhen a paper is submitted to a journal, the journal is chosen depending on at least two criteria: on one side its prestige, because the more prestigious, the more read, and the goal of an academics is of course to be read by the other researchers in his domain;\non the other side, for the seriousness of the journal (which is tacitly known in its academic community), because the peer-review process is <i>very</i> important for the authors (no academics like to have a paper published and then discover that there is a mistake in it).\nAmusingly, this is something that scientific news magazine such as Nature and Science are not that good at.<p>Third, the real conclusion of the poorly carried experiment that the author makes is that the bibliometrics pressure on researcher (“<i>publish or perish</i>”) coupled to their desirable and natural wish to be more widely read, and thus to publish in open access journals, gave birth to an unhealthy publication business that is harmful to research and science (I recall that the author only experimented with authors-pay open access journal, calling it simple &quot;open access&quot;, as if he was, strangely, paid by publishers lobby to increase the already existing confusion between <i>gold open access</i> (where authors pay) and <i>open access</i>, which exists in many different models).<p>To me, the real solution to all these problem lies in <i>Diamond Open Access</i> and <i>Open Peer-Review</i>.",1404921466

8010306,comment,8004571,8009581,1,0,hhw,,,"> 1b) Testing was not skewed by faster cores. CPU performance analysis was based on SPEC CPU 2006 using base rate runtime. SPEC CPU is a multi-core benchmark with metrics that scale linearly on number of CPU cores.<p>I wasn&#x27;t suggesting that the testing was skewed by faster cores, but that your criteria favour hardware configurations optimized for fewer, faster cores because of your comparisons between packages of the same core count.<p>> 1c) The value analysis (based on CPU performance and price) highlights differences in pricing between services. I believe matching CPU cores and deriving value is preferable to comparing compute instances based on price.<p>We&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree on this point. It&#x27;s been my experience that in real-world situations when comparing options, nobody is going to reject higher core counts when at the same price. Generally, a decision maker looks for the lowest price that meets all requirements, or the best option that still fits within budget. They&#x27;re not going to simply say that since one provider offers a package with this particular core count, that they&#x27;ll only compare against other providers&#x27; options with the exact same core count regardless of price. That&#x27;s what I mean by the core selections being arbitrary.<p>For example, an E5 2643v2 6x3.5GHz CPU costs about the same as an E5 2670v2 10x2.5GHz CPU. The 2670v2 offers approximately 25% more aggregate performance, and is clearly the better option except for the unusual cases where single-threaded performance is more important than aggregate performance. However, given how you choose to compare different packages with the same core counts, infrastructure using the 2643v2 would be favoured in your testing. The decision to compare a single 2643v2 core vs a single 2670v2 core, would be completely arbitrary.<p>> 2) The intent of the post was to provide and compare multiple relevant performance characteristics for these types of workloads: CPU, memory, (non-cached) storage IO, network. Each of these characteristics is analyzed separately using relevant benchmarks and runtime settings. If your workload relies more heavily on cached IO, then more emphasis could be placed on the memory performance analysis.<p>My point is, the vast majority of web and database servers either rely heavily on cached IO, or should be. SSD&#x27;s should not be necessary for web servers; you will be able to serve a higher number of requests with the same budget using a larger amount of RAM instead. Likewise, you should fit your entire database into RAM if you can, and just resort to SSD&#x27;s when you can&#x27;t. And this isn&#x27;t limited to I/O, you can reduce the amount of CPU resources required by caching to RAM also. As such, doing a comparison of packages based on the amount of RAM included is going to be more meaningful than doing a comparison based on the number of cores.",1404921314

It could have been handled properly by establishing ad revenue pricing structures early on, but it was easier for them to cry, complain and voluntarily remain ignorant of new tech while the owners of the publications bemoaned that their paper publication is not making enough money to stay afloat and keep their trophy wives in sport cars and designer jewelry at the same time.<p>I have no pity on these ignorant fools.

There&#x27;s still money to be made, but to slow moving non-tech billion dollar companies not million dollar companies and other tech startups.<p>2) Managers hate it because employee reward should continue to be based solely on golf games and kissing up and physical attraction and socioeconomic class, just like it has been historically.  Having some app decide who&#x27;s doin it right and who&#x27;s doin it wrong smacks of replacing that manager with a tiny little shell script, and oddly enough managers don&#x27;t like the idea of downsizing themselves.  Never sell gamification to the manager of &quot;mere resources&quot;, sell to the manager&#x27;s manager or higher.<p>3) Someone&#x27;s 3rd party tool is hard to game and manipulate, but something home grown can be screwed around with so the &quot;right&quot; people win, both preselected peons and preselected lower level mgrs.

Who knows? This is far from obvious to me. Pierre Sprey advocated this line. But even his favorite optimized light weight fighters were adapted to multiple roles and replaced many more specialized aircraft.<p>Another alternative would have been to develop nothing really new, just keep operating old airframes, maybe manufacture some minor updates (F-15, F-16 and Super Hornet are being manufactured). They don&#x27;t have stealth, though some versions have some minor stealthiness. Russia and China are developing at least reasonably stealthy aircraft (PAK-FA, J-20, J-31). The F-22 is not manufactured but AFAIK the tooling is preserved. But it&#x27;s a more specialized aircraft anyway. I think doing nothing would not have been a politically possible path.<p>Everybody complains but there aren&#x27;t that many better directions. Some countries could at least buy European or Russian generation 4.5 fighters if they want to avoid JSF, but that&#x27;s mostly it.",1404918270

8009959,comment,8007952,8009239,3,0,eevilspock,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about an idea that would solve this: Readers subscribe to a federation of publishers for, say, 10 or 20 dollars a month. After they read an article, they can click either a &quot;worth it&quot;, &quot;meh&quot; or &quot;garbage&quot; button. At the end of the month, all subscription fees are distributed to each publisher proportional to their &quot;worth it&quot; votes. This will drive up quality. If &quot;garbage&quot; votes are penalized, it will discourage bad content as well as link-baiting, dishonest titles or any other gaming of traffic.<p>The primary impetus is to get the internet off of advertising. It&#x27;s an absolute fallacy that ads give us content and services for free. It actually makes the web much more expensive:<p><i>1.</i> The advertisers who pay google get their money from us, added to the prices of the things we buy. There is no free lunch.<p><i>2.</i> The overhead cost of advertising is huge and we pay for that too.<p><i>3.</i> We pay the opportunity cost of a product that cannot put users first because they live or die by giving advertisers what they want (and what we want indirectly and secondarily). This includes both the cost of lost privacy as well as well as design that optimizes advertising revenue. As has been said, we are more Google&#x27;s products than we are their customers.<p><i>4.</i> We pay the social costs. Democracy and the free market assume people make voting and purchasing decisions based on facts and reason. Advertising as predominantly about manipulation and deceit. I believe this is the most expensive cost of services that rely on advertising revenue.<p>Added together, we are paying a lot more for &quot;free&quot; web searches and email than if we could just straight up pay Google for straight-up ad-free versions.<p>[This is a condensed version of a more detailed case with reference links that I made here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773</a>]",1404918048

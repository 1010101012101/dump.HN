Public monuments and property are there for the enjoyment and use of the public, if that usage does no harm it should be allowed.  The placing of this bust pushes the limits of this usage but should still be considered fair use and free speech since the artists did no harm. Even though it will cost whatever the wages and rates for the equipment needed to move it will be, I would argue that this cost could be avoided in a freer country by sanctioning this type of protest so that the artists could come forward to remove it themselves (I&#x27;m sure they would have interest from galleries or individuals for this piece) or better yet there could be a popular vote on whether to keep it.",1428346778

Keep in mind, no one is really intrinsically concerned with the economy as an abstract concept. The things that we really care about are how this complex system affects real humans, and once we&#x27;re talking about a change in quality of life for humans, we can compare them to saving lives via the QALY. It&#x27;s the sort of process that&#x27;s more statistical in nature, but you can get an idea whether you&#x27;re doing more harm than good. The point above is that a back of the napkin calculation indicates that it is rather unlikely that someone working at Goldman Sachs is causing more harm than good if they donate half their income.",1428346684

9329970,comment,9328921,9329641,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"It&#x27;s worse than that; the input itself is only 8-bit and they scale up, and then back down again to 8-bit on the output side.<p>But it works, for the same reason that audio engineers use 64-bit signal pipelines inside their DAW even though nearly all output equipment (and much input equipment) is 16-bit which is already at the limit of human perception.<p>If you have a 16-bit signal path, then every device on the signal path gets 16 bits of input and 16-bits of output.  So every device in the path rounds to the nearest 16-bit value, which has an error of +/- 0.5 per device.<p>However if you do a lot of those back to back they accumulate.  If you have 32 steps in your signal path and each is +/- 0.5 then the total is +/- 16.  Ideally some of them will cancel out, but in the worst case it&#x27;s actually off by 16.  &quot;off by 16&quot; is equivalent to &quot;off by lg2(16)=4 bits&quot;.  So now you don&#x27;t have 16-bit audio, you have 12-bit audio, because 4 of the bits are junk.  And 12-bit audio is no longer outside the limit of human perception.<p>Instead if you do all the math at 64-bit you still have 4 bits of error but they&#x27;re way over in bits 60-64 where nobody can ever hear them.  Then you chop down to 16-bit at the very end and the quality is better.  You can have a suuuuuuuper long signal path that accumulates 16 or 32 or 48 bits of error and nobody notices because you still have 16 good bits.<p>tl;dr rounding errors accumulate inside the encoder",1428346634

I wish they&#x27;d stop calling it &#x27;cost per transaction&#x27;.<p>Imagine you build a bridge for $1m and 1 person drives on it. Does that bridge cost $1m per user?<p>No, it&#x27;s just an average metric. There isn&#x27;t actually a marginal cost of $1m for every person that drives on that bridge. It just happens that the bridge is underutilized and that the average cost appears high.<p>Blocks are like that. If the block holds 0 transactions, the block reward is paid out. If the block holds 1 trillion transactions, the block reward is paid out. Either case, it&#x27;s 25 bitcoins. In other words, a transaction does not carry a marginal cost in block rewards, as block rewards are paid out regardless of ANY number of transactions.<p>Transaction fees are the marginal cost, and those are pennies.<p>As for the block&#x27;s capacity to hold transactions? That&#x27;s interesting. If the $1m bridge could only ever move 1 person, then the cost of driving on that bridge was indeed $1m.<p>But blocks have quite large capacities. Currently 1mb, they&#x27;re set to go to 20mb probably this year, and grow to hundreds of megabytes over time. Read about it from Chief Scientist at TBF on bitcoin [0].<p>The roadmap is that in 12 years according to the work that&#x27;s being put in the protocol right now, you can fit a little under 400 million bitcoin transactions in a single block, using technology that&#x27;s as expensive as the one that&#x27;s running bitcoin nodes today. (cheap consumer grade home computers.) In 12 years, bitcoin will have had nearly 4 more halvings, meaning block rewards are by then only 1.5 bitcoin per block.<p>In other words, in roughly a decade bitcoin&#x27;s block rewards will be a tiny tiny fraction of a fraction of a penny.<p>And even then, it&#x27;s STILL not a &#x27;cost per transaction&#x27;.

This obviously saves an extra lookup, but the real eyeopener was that you can do PC++, fetch, jump all with one instruction. Use the host stack pointer as the PC in the interpreter and this become ret - return grabs an address, increments the pointer, and branches all in one. Of course you get program corruption on interrupts then. Needs to be either a system you have complete control over, or one with a second stack pointer.",1428345174

Not that it wasn&#x27;t a tragedy, just that it wasn&#x27;t specifically against Poles. It was pretty much the same &quot;upper class cleansing&quot; that happened in USSR - military  officers, ministers, government, and other educated or &quot;advanced&quot; in any other way people. Bandera on the other hand was specifically killing Poles.<p>>You lie regarding the nationalist forces (look up the percentage won by right wing parties in elections after Majdan - less than 5% IIRC).<p>Yatsenuk&#x27;s and Poroshenko&#x27;s parties took around 50% and have full power in the country. It is these forces that direct the &quot;pacifying&quot; operation in the East which in particular results in significant ethnic cleansing of that region.<p>>And the threat to ethnic Russians in Ukraine is pure bullshit Russian propaganda.

These new Ukraine powers were stupid to immediately manifest direct and open hostility toward ethnic Russians (first order of business of the new powers - the language law - no practical effect, only huge symbolic gesture) before having built up the military forces. Putin doesn&#x27;t care about fate of these ethnic Russians of course, it just provided the opening for him, and Crimea more than happily voted for separation (speaking about democracy - Crimea separation was more democratic than the power change in Kiev, so if you think that current regime in Kiev is democratically legitimate than it would be a double standard to not recognize Crimea separation). And as a side effect Ukraine got punished for stupidity of their new regime. Nationalism blinded by hate always gets punished in the end...<p>And by the way - everybody is ok with Saudis attacking Yemen where the president they liked was ousted...

These companies make money by knowing what other people are doing -- capturing order flow -- so they try to publish the lowest quote possible in order to get the order because by law the brokerage must fill the order at the &quot;national best bid/offer&quot;. This results in price improvement for the customer over half the time. This improvement doesn&#x27;t get squeezed from another counter-party as I think you&#x27;re thinking, and actually both counter-parties are likely to be price-improved. The improvement comes from smaller bid/ask spreads.<p>Here&#x27;s what I know for certain: With high frequency trading tech comes more liquidity, with lower commissions, faster trade execution, and a small bid/ask spread. There are more penny-wide markets than ever before. Look, I&#x27;m just a retail trader. I have no reason to shill for HFT firms. And I even love Michael Lewis.

It&#x27;s certainly true that investors won&#x27;t throw money at bitcoin as easily as they would have in 2013-2014 when growth rates were off the charts. The past year or so has been slow for bitcoin from a consumer growth pov.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean interest really dipped in absolute numbers, it&#x27;s just different. Thing is, in 2013 the average quarter raised about $25m. In 2014 that went up to about $70m.<p>But guess what happened this quarter in 2015? Over $200m.<p>The difference is that in the past 2 years we saw lots of smaller seed/series a funding, lots of $1m, $5m, and a few $15-30m here and there. This quarter we saw a ton of <$2m, a single $15m, and two giant (for bitcoin) $75m and $120m investments. In other words we&#x27;re already seeing some &#x27;winners&#x27; and investors consolidating around those companies, and a lot of low-risk experimental seed rounds.<p>Buttercoin was never one of those winners. And in the exchange market, it&#x27;s really hard to suddenly become one, when another company like Coinbase exists that&#x27;s present in multiple markets, has engineers from places like Facebook and Airbnb, finance guys from Goldman Sachs, VPs from Paypal, $100m in funding and domination in various bitcoin product categories.<p>Especially when running an exchange, which is sort of a commodity. Branding etc aren&#x27;t big differentiators. So let&#x27;s look at what an exchange needs:<p>Bitcoin Exchanges need liquidity (uphill battle as a late-comer)<p>They need to allow buyers & sellers to easily move fiat money on and off the platform (uphill battle to convince a US bank to service you)<p>They need to comply with all the regulations (difficult for any money transmitter, as you need licenses in all but two states. Very hard to be a startup when you face $1-5m in legal costs to get licensed. Plus, states are coming out with Bitcoin regulations that double the regulatory load as they don&#x27;t replace, but add to existing money transmitter regulations)<p>They need good security (this one ought to be a possibility for startups. But it&#x27;s not easy, it slows you down and increases your costs to have expertise checking every part of your software. The old bitcoin companies could fall down and learn and iterate. The new startups have to get it right from day one.)<p>Buttercoin came a bit too late to the game, in a world with large existing exchanges, launched in one of the most difficult regulatory environments etc.<p>Beyond that, running a bitcoin exchange isn&#x27;t very profitable at the moment unless 1) You&#x27;re one of the big guys. 2) You&#x27;re spending nothing on security, fancy ui, new products, customer service etc and run a 2-man show, where every dollar you earn is pretty much income. Problem is, becoming 1 can&#x27;t be done anymore without 2, and doing 2 can&#x27;t be done without large investments, and investors have no interest in backing Buttercoin over say Coinbase or Circle.<p>So Bitstamp is one of the larger exchanges in the world and has about 5k bitcoins in daily value. At a 0.25% fee (both to seller and buyer), they take half a percent on their volume. That&#x27;s a little over $2m in yearly revenue. Now imagine that Coinbase has 60 employees, if you consider that the cost per employee (salary + office, equipment, training etc) in SF is $150k, that kind of budget just doesn&#x27;t fly. Even with some investment your burn rate is too high.<p>I think Buttercoin must have had around 10 employees, $1.6m funding, less than $500k annual revenue and limited traction. Looking forward to what they&#x27;ll do next because Buttercoin worked well and was a nice product, it must have been a good team.",1428343843

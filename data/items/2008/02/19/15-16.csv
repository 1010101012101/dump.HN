Her hobbies and interests in particular.<p>2) See in what areas she wants to grow.  One thing older people tend to do is become set in their ways.  You need to show her how the internet will bring value to her current interests instead of turning her on to things that younger people find cool.  It MIGHT alienate her from the internet if she sees too many 2girls1cup reaction videos (sorry, I couldn't resist!!) on YouTube.<p>3) Show her some sites that are small enough that she doesn't get overwhelmed with information.  I think the overwhelming factor is something that turns seniors off.<p>Depending on your granny's sensitivities, I would recommend putting a ""safe browsing"" application on your computer.  You tend to forget how easy it was to stumble onto a site with flashing banner advertisements for Viagra during the late 90s.<p>I think as a first application, Google Earth (as you said a no-brainer) would be the place to start.  The level of control over her own experience she would have as far as how much information she would access depends on her level of comfort; and hopefully over the course of a few days this should increase such that she is more comfortable absorbing new information.  The metaphor of exploring the world in a virtual sense might help ease the transition to exploring the internet directly through a browser.  Also, the gliding effect is calming in the sense that it's not a sudden jump: there are nice transitions between flying from one place to another and zooming in and out.  The one problem you might face, however, is convincing her to use Google Earth over and over again; one way to do this is to provide her with a ""travel itinerary"" such that she can visit famous places to which she has never been.<p>I would recommend familiarizing her with one application per month.",1203436620

118952,comment,118725,118725,0,0,hugh,,,"The article is trying to give the impression of a vanishing middle class, but the data really don't seem to back it up. It defines ""middle-wage jobs"" as people earning between $30K and $80K, and notes that the proportion of these has dropped from 52% to 46% in the last few years. But with the exception of students, there's virtually nobody in Silicon Valley earning less than $30K anyway, so I suspect what this really means is that more and more people are earning over $80K, while the number of full-time workers earning less than $30K has remained close to zero.<p>Good news spun as bad?",1203436004

118947,comment,118691,118772,0,0,fiaz,,,"Good point.  I admire what Jobs has done with OSX in making it easy for developers to create first class software.  Perhaps Xobni is exemplary of this model for Microsoft.  An acquisition of Xobni might not benefit Microsoft as much as seeing Xobni flourish independently and be an example of grassroots development that is so prevalent in the OSX community.<p>If Microsoft has realized that they have cannibalized a large segment of developers (think plankton in an ecosystem analogy) then they might realize that it's better to have more diversity and encourage independent developers to create quality software such as Xobni.",1203435848

They are claiming to possess algorithms that are able to predict the success of a given startup.  I'm curious to know how many startups they have successfully invested in that they have developed algorithms against.<p>I would imagine PG would be in a better position on MANY levels to write something like this, if possible.  Indeed if such a thing were possible, I would imagine there would be some serious PhD research in this area.<p>I find it funny that this got as much initial positive press as it did whereas programs that can predict the stock market reliably (a much simpler problem given the relatively controlled/closed system of any given market compared to the virtual chaotic environment of a startup in the wild) are often passed off as snake oil in many circles.  Taking this problem alone (automated trading programs) there are multi-billion dollar investment firms that spend millions on teams of developers and PhD working out formulas and algorithms to crack this problem; I know from personal experience that these systems are only good for a few months and are constantly changing.  This fact alone diminishes the predictive value of whatever algorithms they have developed over time...<p>If two 20 somethings have something that groundbreaking that does NOT require constant tweaking (unlikely) then they must have discovered some new mathematical property governing human decision making at a large scale (even more unlikely).",1203435429

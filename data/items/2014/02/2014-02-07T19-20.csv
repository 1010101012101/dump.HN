But, I feared rejection. So usually I sit there, mulling over about it while watching her from the corner of my eyes. (Which is really creepy for the women). My mind comes up with any number of scenarios, reasons, narratives to try to get me to go talk with her. Or, perhaps, I try to come up with worst case scenarios.<p>I recognize now that, those thoughts I come up with are ways for me to avoid feeling fear that is arising in that moment. It was much more comfortable coming up with ideas or thinking about things than it is to touch that fear of rejection. I&#x27;m used to thinking.<p>These days, the attitude I have is simply that I&#x27;m being friendly, and there&#x27;s no expectation of that. I&#x27;m making an invitation to be friendly and leaving it at that superficial chit-chat. Someone might decline the invitation, and that&#x27;s ok.<p>To get to that point though, I&#x27;ve made deep dives into the fear, into the things this touches.<p>Being able to chit-chat with strangers is nice. What is nicer is when I come to a technical decision that involve things like cutting out code I&#x27;ve vested a lot of effort in, because it does not work. Rather than trying to come up with why it does not work, I now know how to emotionally accept that this needs to happen. Then I cut it away and move on to getting it done.",1391801918

It&#x27;s just that, <i>typically</i> (but not always), men have a habit of &quot;fixing the problem&quot; as a way to avoid emotional processing.<p>Before you can solve a problem or take action, you first have to accept that there is a problem and action needs to be taken. That acceptance is an emotional thing. It isn&#x27;t a product of reason or intellect. It&#x27;s not so much that men do not emotionally process, but rather, people who are not in tune with their emotions and suck at it will try to use reason to talk themselves into acceptance. And it never works.<p>For people who are more in tuned with the heart of things, watching someone like that is like watching someone going around and around in circles, using the wrong part of their consciousness. Furthermore, the only way to be in tune with your emotion is to acknowledge and experience those emotions. You cannot force someone to fully experience something. The powers of human denial and aversion are very creative.<p>However, once you&#x27;ve emotionally accepted that there is a problem and action needs to be taken, it is from there that reasoning and problem solving skills allows you to quickly get stuff done.<p>Mindfully listening to someone as they speak allows them to feel safe to touch those emotions within themselves.

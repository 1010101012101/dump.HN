Don't say you ""actively contribute"" to the radeonhd project -- describe 2 or 3 of your major contributions.<p>Another suggestion: make use of the fact your resume is web-based.  Instead of linking directly to linkedin etc, link to a uri on your domain which redirects.  That way you can find out your clickthrough rate, and alter your online profile accordingly.  For example, if no one ever clicks your LinkedIn profile, you may want to put your employment history on the page itself.  If you apply to companies in different locations, you can roughly figure out which ones look at which pages via a geoip lookup.",1259823185

This should be faster than mousing around.<p>For text input the options are a keyboard or voice input/brain input.

That was the last piece of major code that I have written in something other than Lisp. Immediately after that, I wrote a similar package in CL with a web-based interface, using the free allegro serve; this one took me about a month, though it was functional after the first week.<p>I know what you're thinking; the previous project gave you the hindsight necessary to implement the second so quickly. Well, not really. The stuff I did in Lisp where things that have been on my requirements for the first project but was never able to implement without huge investments in time. MFC is the most brittle, most fickle and fidgety POS of all time; it generates the boilerplate for you and it expects to you to use its skeletons just the way they are. It took me months to experiment with the various data access APIs, ADO, DAO, and ODBC, moving from one to the next as problems arose, and each change of backend requiring a complete code overhaul.<p>Now I write database code in native idiomatic code; I can change the backend with a feature.

6443075,comment,6442289,6442963,13,0,scarmig,,,"A couple points:<p>1) It&#x27;s not like the Soviet Union was a terrible hellhole for research. It had impressive research output for decades.<p>2) That&#x27;s almost beside the point, however. Let&#x27;s take it as a given that more good research, whatever that is, is a worthy goal for a society, and that the market under-invests in it in favor of short term profits. It&#x27;s obviously not a binary of either 100% government funding or 100% private; it&#x27;s not even really a one-dimensional continuum, because for the large capital expenditures typically involved in research, the government always has a heavy involvement, either in tax breaks or grants or collaboration. The question is, how do we allocate money to produce the best research? It&#x27;s undoubtedly at some value that&#x27;s somewhere between 0% and 100%.<p>3) There&#x27;s a whole lot of money floating around now that makes endeavors like SpaceX practicable. That wasn&#x27;t the case in, say, the Sixties. Even if the arguments for government spending on research were weak now, they&#x27;d be stronger in the 1960&#x27;s, particularly for things like space exploration that required substantial concentrations of capital.",1380092276

Should it run classic UI or Metro? Should it to run ARM or x86 apps? Should it have a keyboard or a blade? Microsoft&#x27;s answer to all of these is YES, and that means NO polish and NO market share.<p>This blade is another example of not committing - are there any launch partners where you can use this with any software you want? Doesn&#x27;t look like it. So we&#x27;re to expect musicians are going to drop the music software they&#x27;ve been using for years for a cut-down v1 Microsoft remix app? If not, then who&#x27;s it for? The uber casual remixer who.. probably already owns an ipad? Pick a market, guys.<p>I feel bad for the undoubtedly smart folks who put together the blade and the remix app, but who are stuck working on a crappy platform. Building an array of 1000 pressure-sensitive sensors into a touch surface is cool (I&#x27;m impressed w new blade touch architecture), but its also something that a committed hacker could do. And after doing it, they&#x27;d have as much market share and software partners as Microsoft does with this blade on Surface. So... I wouldn&#x27;t call it &#x27;true innovation&#x27;.

And it&#x27;s not even a drop in the bucked compared to the explosion of material that followed the industrial revolutions on general and the modification of copyrights to make them transferable in particular.<p>This legal innovation became the bedrock for the massively collaborative forms of media that went on to define the 20th century (newspapers, encyclopedias, literary anthologies, films, broadcasts, video games to name the biggest).<p>Also, the point of copyright is to resolve a very specific problem, which is reconciling the high capital costs of content creation with the low marginal cost of duplication. Of course, none of the people who casually and dismissively say &quot;just figure out a different model&quot; will be ever be clear about exactly what problem needs solving.<p>That&#x27;s because acknowledging the mathematically inevitable failures awaiting any endevor with high R&D costs and low manufacturing and distribution costs make the logic of copyright clear. Either we create legal protections for the business or let it die.

Because some people never learn another date style even if they prefer a different language.

Now, what if you saw shit like that in the vast majority of content you read, online and out in the world?

6442954,comment,6438320,6441181,12,0,andolanra,,,"&quot;PL theory&quot;, the field of study, contains many, <i>many</i> theories of programming. There is not <i>a</i> lambda calculus, there are <i>several</i> (e.g. the untyped lambda calculus, the simply typed lambda calculus, System F, Martin-Lf&#x27;s dependent type theory, among others) although not all of them are Turing-equivalent (the lack of which can be a useful feature), as well as other systems which are <i>not</i> based on lambda (e.g. concatenative calculi, which correspond roughly to things like Forth.) In fact, from a quick perusal, it seems that Nock is a minor variation on a graph rewriting system with the graphs restricted to DAGs, so... a studied and established theory of computation.<p>Similarly, there are techniques for representing code as data that are quite widely known and understood in programming language theory, e.g. through Danvy&#x27;s defunctionalization or the use of arrows to make explicit the structure of computation or stage-separation and things like Lisp macros. These also are not ignored in the field of PL theory.<p>Effectively, my criticism is that your practical understanding of &quot;PL theory&quot; amounts to a mostly-remembered reading of &quot;Types and Programming Languages,&quot; and so you are accidentally reinventing things poorly and describing them in an ad-hoc way. Now, Nock and Hoon and the others <i>are</i> quite interesting and impressive, and I plan to keep following them in the future, but I still assert that, rather than standing on the shoulders of giants as you could be, you&#x27;ve dismissed them as windmills and are trying to climb your own way.",1380089892

7490962,comment,7490316,7490316,3,0,tbirdz,,,"Isn&#x27;t this kind of the point of free software? To provide software that is equivalent (or better than) proprietary alternatives, and allow users the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software?<p>Are gnu coreutils &quot;unethical&quot; because they reproduce the proprietary unix command line tools with a free software equivalent? Is Linus responsible for informing everyone how Linux was originally inspired from Minix?<p>If I want to study how Threes was implemented, I can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t modify the source code to implement new mechanics, I can&#x27;t port it to new platforms. The only platforms Threes supports is iOS and Android. I don&#x27;t have any devices with either OS, so I would not even be able to play the game. On the other hand, the free software 2048 has been ported to work in many more environments, such as the Web and even the Atari 2600! Threes would have never done that, not in a 1000 years.<p>Also just look at the burst of creativity, and inventiveness 2048 spawned. Now there are tons of derivative projects, each created by someone to tweak the mechanics and provide a new spin on the idea, ranging from simple tweaks, to full blown AIs, and even more advanced projects. And the source code is available to all to study and learn from. Threes inspired none of that. If Threes&#x27; developers had had their way, 2048 would never have even existed. Everyone who was interested would have to play the game Threes exactly as it was, and would not be allowed to change it, to experiment, or to express their creativity. They want to lock the user down.<p>None of this would have been possible from Threes, but it is possible from 2048.<p>If no-one buys Threes anymore, and instead uses 2048, that is not 2048&#x27;s fault. It is not the job of free software developers to promote and support proprietary software. Should LibreOffice be required to do marketing for Microsoft Office, and give all users a link where they can purchase it?<p>Requiring everyone to reference Threes in each derivative is ridiculous. There is a reason why no one uses the original 3-clause BSD license anymore.",1396054732
7490961,comment,7490151,7490746,7,0,wpietri,,,"Yeah. A friend who has a PhD in a relevant topic did a great presentation on the phrase &quot;biblical marriage&quot;. I forget all the permutations, but aside from the traditional man+wife, there was man+slave, man+wife+slave, man+dead brother&#x27;s wife, and a few others. Basically, the people talking about biblical marriage were immensely selective in their interpretation of the bible, finding in it the exact prejudices they brought to it.<p>And the whole argument about tradition, although undoubtedly interesting to some, is irrelevant as far as civil marriage goes. In the recent decision on gay marriage in Michigan, the judge made it clear that &quot;that&#x27;s how we&#x27;ve always done it&quot; isn&#x27;t sufficient justification for a law. The state has to have some rational purpose. And multiple courts, including the one that overturned Prop 8, have concluded that the straights-only marriage laws have no rational purpose.",1396054723

Hayek&#x27;s <i>Road to Serfdom</i> and ostracize them (in fact, I own one!). But how about donating $1000 to Rand Paul&#x27;s campaign? I would consider that equally odious, and yet it is (unfortunately) not that uncommon in the tech community, even among fairly high-profile people with board positions. In my opinion, the right of people with congenital heart diseases to receive medical treatment is of a similar level of importance as the right of gay people to have their marriages recognized by the state—if anything, actually somewhat more urgent in its importance—but a certain sort of &quot;yuppie liberalism&quot;, which I think exists more or less only in Silicon Valley, takes the opposite view.",1396051352

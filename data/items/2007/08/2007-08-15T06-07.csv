It seems to me, the logical way to handle this is to simulate an entire universe, galaxies to atoms.<p>That might sound like it requires an impractical amount of processing power... but only to us _inside_ this universe. If you think about it, it's obviously impractical to simulate an entire universe within the universe itself.<p>In our parent universe, this wouldn't be an issue. Their speed of light must be faster, their atoms smaller. Moore's Law continues apace for them, and they can build computers that seem unthinkably powerful to us.<p>And the weirdness of quantum physics shows the kind of hacks they've made to get it to run.<p>I'm thinking about writing a short story where a guy implements a universe in 7 days...",1187159644

Would you rather spend all your energy on coding and getting that thing to work or would you rather code a few hours and then try to sell your product and do team management for the rest of the time?<p>VCs won't go around looking for programmers to hire to implement their 'great' idea! Have you ever heard of a VC that said no to giving money to a company and then went and looked for a team to implement that idea? I'd also argue  that they like it better if there is a business person in the team.",1187158857

5161873,story,,,1,0,drucken,"Chuck Lorre of TBBT on Ray Kurzweil, the human brain and sitcoms",http://www.chucklorre.com/index-2hm.php?p=406,"According to futurist, inventor and all-around incredibly smart guy, Ray Kurzweil, human beings actually reorganize their frontal cortex as they pursue mastery over different skills. For example, a musician redesigns his or her brain by means of constant study, practice and performance. The same thing applies to a mathematician, carpenter and pole dancer. The brain is physically changed over time by activity and learning. This means we have direct influence and control over how our minds operate. This means we actually mold our perception of the world by the way we mold our brains. This means that over the last twenty-five years, I have reshaped my frontal lobe to do one thing, and one thing only -- write sitcoms. I can't tell you what a relief this knowledge is to me. To begin with, it single-handedly explains why I fail so consistently at other activities (golf, common courtesy and marriage come to mind). It also eases my fears about my disintegrating memory. Why would my brain waste precious neurons remembering where I put my glasses (on the top of my head), or the names of the camera crew (I think one guy is named John, or maybe Jamie or Nigel), when it's working overtime trying to structure a joke about a character masturbating like a meth-addled spider monkey? The answer is, it wouldn't. In other words, I have an advanced case of sitcom brain. On the plus side, I have been highly remunerated for my condition. The downside is that I am constitutionally incapable of ending any communication with a straight line.<p>Just can't do it.<p>Have to spin it somehow.<p>Even if it's cheap or makes no sense.

Before Sony decided to piss off the entire internet, their DRM stood for the better part of a year. Motorola's had some phones that weren't rootable for months on end. In one sense, it's true: the economic forces will ensure that everything highly visible and in high demand will have any DRM broken. What entrepreneurs should notice, is that not everything is subject to the same economic forces.<p>There is a valuable analogy in physical locks. Since the industrial revolution, inventors produce a constant supply of new lock designs which get broken by clever locksmiths. Nothing stands forever. Yet, people still make money selling locks, and they have actual utility. Most of the possible uses for locks are for content which is far less known and far less sought after than someone's rare Ferrari or the bragging rights on the newest lock at the world expo.<p>Many would say digital goods are different. I say that's primarily wishful thinking. Cash is highly fungible, but is still successfully secured with chintzy little locks in many cases. I think it's high time for <i>people</i> to get their own DRM. It's hopeless for big corporations, but ordinary people are actually in the right economic position to benefit from DRM.",1359937519

5161825,comment,5161821,5161821,1,0,barredo,,,"Firewalled! Sorry. Here's the text.<p>Foxconn, the contract manufacturer whose biggest customer is Apple, is preparing genuinely representative labour union elections in its factories in China for the first time, a powerful sign of the changes in the workshop of the world demanded by an increasingly restive workforce.<p>This would be the first such exercise at a large company in China, where labour unions have traditionally been controlled by management and local government. Foxconn is the country’s largest private sector employer with 1.2m mainland workers.<p>The Taiwanese company, the world’s largest contract maker of electronics, said that the new election process would see a larger representation of junior employees and no management involvement.<p>“The position of chairman and 20 committee members of the Foxconn Federation of Labour Unions Committee will be determined through elections once every five years through an anonymous ballot voting process,” Foxconn said in response to questions from the Financial Times.<p>The move is part of Foxconn’s attempts to tweak its manufacturing machine, which makes a large proportion of the world’s gadgets such as iPhones, tablets and computers, in response to frequent worker protests, riots, strikes and soaring labour costs. Beijing is also encouraging collective bargaining as a way to help contain the growing unrest.<p>Since a wave of worker suicides at the company’s Chinese plants in 2009 and 2010, its treatment of its huge workforce has attracted intense scrutiny. Foxconn has become a focus for criticism of practices widespread in Chinese factories including illegal overtime, low pay and the use of underage workers.<p>Apple reacted by bringing in the Fair Labor Association, a US-based labour group, for an audit of some of the manufacturer’s largest plants. One of the issues pinpointed by the FLA was the union’s failure truly to represent workers.<p>After the Lunar New Year holiday this month, Foxconn, with the help of the FLA, will begin training its Chinese workers in how to vote for their representatives. They will be choosing up to 18,000 union committees whose terms expire this year and in 2014, according to three people familiar with the situation. Since the unions have so far had no real role in addressing worker grievances and have been dominated by management, most young workers know nothing about what a real labour union is supposed to do.<p>Foxconn said more than 70 per cent of the 188 employee-elected representatives at its Shenzhen campus were frontline workers. However, sources familiar with the matter said workers have historically had little say in the committees that run the union.<p>“The process through which Foxconn’s current labour union representatives were chosen was not democratic because there was no open and transparent nomination of candidates, and it is not representative because more than half of the committee members are from management,” said one person working on the election plans.\nThe chairman of Foxconn’s labour union in China, Chen Peng, is the former head of the office of Terry Gou, the company’s founder and chief executive. People familiar with the company described Ms Peng, who uses the English name Peggy, as a key confidante of Mr Gou and a trusted member of the management team in China.",1359937484

And even if you do catch a seller what does that get you? Nothing! You're no closer to closing down Silk Road itself.<p>> Crapflood it with fake buyers/sellers making it less useful.<p>You can't be a fake buyer. Buyers must pony up the bitcoin up front and so that only helps sellers. Who cares where the actual drugs went, the seller got his money. Fake sellers are quickly caught out because of the reputation system. Buyers already know which sellers are reputable, they'll just keep buying from them. You can't do anything about that.<p>> Order drugs & gather forensic info from the packages.<p>This just targets individual sellers and won't do anything to stop Silk Road. Especially if the sellers are overseas.<p>> Heck, agree to sell someone drugs and actually send them flour + a GPS/camera if you want to go that route.<p>Yes buyers are vulnerable and always will be on Silk Road. That doesn't stop anyone and you'll usually only bust small time users which is a waste of resources.<p>>For the most part, just go after the weak human links in the chain and use standard anti-network tactics like turning people into informants and isolating everyone via mistrust.<p>Informants are useless. No seller can help you take down Silk Road because no seller knows where it's hosted or who is running it.<p>> Heck, they could just start scamming folks on the site.<p>Reputation systems stop this.

Perhaps it's really about pointing out how people who think like this are just being monumental pricks. Whether or not you're comfortable with that is up to you. But if you think you can be a prick and not get called on it, well, guess again.<p>One more thing: not paying is stealing. Copy all you want, that's not theft (making isn't taking, etc.) But just understand that the second you make a copy, you own the artist money. And if you decide to keep that money, you're holding onto something that is no longer yours. Which, as we all know, is explicitly wrong.<p>It's like bouncing a check. Sure, the money to back it will be in your account (i.e. your possession) for a few days after, but that doesn't mean it's your money, in that spending it on something else will land you in legal trouble if doing so causes the check to bounce. It's different in that the artist doesn't know you stole from them by keeping money to which you're not entitled, so it's not such a direct violation of trust. But it's still wrong. And since the artist has no moral obligation to make a transaction seamless, you can't put yourself back in the right by saying ""well, I found that paying was harder than breathing, so that means the artists forfeits completely.""<p>Sorry, but that's not how the law or ethics work.

In particular, all those in Yucatán were ordered destroyed by Bishop Diego de Landa in July of 1562. De Landa wrote: ""We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they (the Maya) regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction."" Such codices were primary written records of Maya civilization, together with the many inscriptions on stone monuments and stelae that survived.</i> [1]<p>As for the Aztecs, interestingly, many of their books were burned prior to the Spanish invasion:<p><i>Two of the primary architects of the Aztec empire were the half-brothers Tlacaelel and Montezuma I, nephews of Itzcoatl. Moctezuma I succeeded Itzcoatl as Hueyi Tlatoani in 1440. Although he was also offered the opportunity to be tlatoani, Tlacaelel preferred to operate as the power behind the throne. Tlacaelel reformed the Aztec state and religion. According to some sources, he ordered the burning of most of the extant Aztec books claiming that they contained lies. He thereupon rewrote the history of the Aztec people, thus creating a common awareness of history for the Aztecs.</i> [2]<p>In any case, there are more than 3 Aztec codices in existence now.

This isn't caught inside the implementation, because the encoding library only normalizes when writing. When it reads the data in, it still just represented it as bytes, and there was no ASCII single quote byte until the end of the dangerous string.<p>So, yes, it's possible that even something as simple as ""string encoding"" could be used to implement an attack.",1359936206

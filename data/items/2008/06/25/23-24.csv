A bunch of friends scalable is a far cry from TechCrunch scalable. Are you confident that if you break on TechCrunch, your app won't fail? There's nothing worse than breaking big and then... breaking big. People will lose all faith in you. If your site is ready technically, why not just put it out there? There are probably way more potential compteitors here, so in some sense you are launching to an unusual pool.<p>On the other hand side, if your application is not yet scalable - private or invite only beta is probably your only option.",1214438371

That'll avoid any problems with getting it to run at gigabit - my workstation's onboard network chip is really picky about cable quality for example and will drop to 100Mbit/s on cables that all my other gigabit gear handles just fine. Use cables with shielded RJ-45 connectors, the all-plastic ones can cause trouble when running at 1Gbit/s over longer distances.<p>I don't think there's much of an art to it, just follow the instructions on the web.

It seems utterly pointless. Why not install NoHTML while you're at it, or use lynx.<p>Also never understood the philosophy behind adblock. If a website starts doing garish irritating ads, just don't go there again.",1241247586

No Jessica Livingston, no Y Combinator.<p>Tell Henry Ford and Ray Kroc that there's nothing exceptional about being the first to figure out how to organize something.  And YC's impact might just end up being more than either of those.",1241247412

589619,story,,,5,6,bazookaaa,"Ask HN: Switching my site's SMS capabilities over to Twitter. Good or bad idea?",,"Hi HN, I'd like your input on something. My site allows people to add information to their account via email and SMS, and it also sends out notifications to email/SMS. I had an idea to completely replace my homemade SMS functionality with twitter.<p>Notifications (outgoing): Using email gateways for SMS is unreliable and only available to a few carriers. With twitter, my users would just have to provide their twitter username. My app would then send out a DM and they would get a text message from twitter.<p>Incoming: A simple ""d soshiku [query]"" sent to 40404 and that's it. My app doesn't actually offer ""true texting"" since they have to send their text to an email address.<p>The problem is, there's a couple thousand people with their phone credentials hooked up to their accounts. I would essentially have to force them to sign up with twitter if they'd like to continue using the SMS services.<p>Do you think this a good idea, or a foolish one? Thanks.<p>Edit: My site is free, though I am working on paid plans.",1241246880

Being able to save and search through 500 clipboards makes Quicksilver the one greatest productivity tool I have.<p><pre><code>  iTerm</code></pre>\nMultiple profiles, full screen mode, sending commands to all open tabs, etc. make it a better terminal than Terminal.<p><pre><code>  Adium</code></pre>\nIt doesn't have video chat yet but I don't mind. It does everything else I could want an IM client to do and the OTR encryption works right out of the box. Plus, the next version reportedly supports both Twitter and IRC.<p><pre><code>  Navicat</code></pre>\nIt's the best tool I've seen for accessing remote databases (I use the MySQL version for Windows running in CrossOver). Sequel Pro and Querious both win on looks but Navicat has the features I need.<p><pre><code>  Drupal</code></pre>\nDrupal is known for being a good content management system but for me it's an absolutely great web application framework. It does nearly everything I need my websites to do, from running wikis and OpenID providers to large social networks, project management platforms, ecommerce sites and virtual worlds. The Drupal community is so large and diverse that the conferences, camps and user groups are the best I've seen around any industry or software project.<p><pre><code>  Virtualmin and Webmin</code></pre>\nThese are web control panels like cPanel and WHM that are available as a free, GPL version or as a commercially supported ""Pro"" version. I think Virtualmin is a YC startup, too. Virtualmin and Webmin are occasionally a little rough around the edges but they have completely taken away the pain of administering my sites.<p><pre><code>  GrandCentral</code></pre>\nIt used to be that using voicemail was a necessary time expenditure that nobody really questioned. GrandCentral saves me a lot of time I'd otherwise be wasting.<p>Here's a tip: don't upgrade your GrandCentral account to Google Voice unless you want the stuff that only Google Voice has (like voicemail transcription). All the GrandCentral-compatible tools like GrandCentral Dialer for the Nokia N8x0 tablets don't work with Google Voice yet.",1241246846

589616,comment,589515,589586,0,0,larryfreeman,,,"True story.  I was a manager at Sun for 7+ years.  I was on the original J2EE team and by any criteria you like, I was pretty successful as a manager (I have no problem lining up an initial interview based on my resume).<p>In 2006, I decided to leave Sun.  Layoffs every 3 months was no fun and it was pretty stressful working so hard to protect my team (I am very proud to say that no one who worked for me got layed off).<p>I hadn't programmed since 1999 and the coding world had changed dramatically.  I discovered that my management record was too good for someone who couldn't answer the basic programming questions.  I couldn't get the Director position at Google, Amazon, or pretty much anywhere.  For that matter, I couldn't get the engineering position or the Senior Management position either.  The interview usually ended very quickly.<p>Today, I am very happy as a PHP engineer at a start up.  Best decision I've ever made.  I might go back into management if the start up gets big enough.<p>My lesson from this experience is that to have credibility as an engineering manager in this internet world, you need to keep your edge.  Otherwise, you better be good at networking.",1241246302

589610,comment,589428,589428,0,0,jamesjyu,,,"My main problem with HAML is that it is another markup language to learn. And, it's just not worth it time-wise to switch everything over (or even new templates) over to HAML. This is especially true for cross-functional teams that include not only coders, but designers and other people who already know HTML very well. Adding HAML will just cause confusion.<p>IMO, the benefits of HAML are fringe.",1241245644

This seems to be the essential male proclivity for seeking greatness at work. I wonder if that is why there seem to be fewer female founders (AFAIK).<p>However, the worst thing to take away from this article would be that you can predict how an individual will react given their gender. That is definitely not true. Although, if you look at a group of people, you can probably predict some of the distribution.",1241244760
589604,comment,589346,589376,0,0,robertk,,,"This is one of those articles that could be labelled ""worldview changing."" I mean this in the sense that to gain knowledge of certain facts and arguments has immense corollaries for how one understands and interprets the world. Here are two other recent examples I can think of:<p>- Moore's Law and the resulting implications regarding the ""singularity""<p>- ""Happiness"" turns out to not be a Platonic ideal or otherwise specially-valued conception, but simply an ever-present state with slight fluctuations (and then perhaps ""getting"" happiness refers to obtaining the highest positive fluctuation--which will however stabilize over some time). See the recent TED talk on synthesizing happiness.<p>The key fact in this article, from which all other conclusions naturally seem to follow, is that males as a statistic exhibit much higher traits of extremity (in all aspects) due to the historically much higher probability of a woman being able to obtain a partner and reproduce.",1241244329

They use goats to keep the place they have carved out of the jungle tidy and free of weeds.

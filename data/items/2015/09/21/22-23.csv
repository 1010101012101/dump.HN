10255542,comment,10254667,10255385,0,0,paulmd,,,"Just to fill in the context that&#x27;s missing here:<p>1.  If you have a single radio unit, you can easily do the &quot;software&quot; implementation where you look at what you&#x27;re going to be broadcasting and cut it off if it&#x27;s not legal.  The problem comes when you have separate radio and amplifiers - the amplifier has no idea what whether you&#x27;re feeding it 10M or CB frequncies.  It will amplify either just fine, so the FCC really prefers you to build in a &quot;hardware&quot; type implementation there (a frequency analyzer that figures out what&#x27;s going into it).  It&#x27;s just expensive to do so - like if you didn&#x27;t already have a digital amp, you might easily add 1/4 or 1/2 to the cost just to get some dumb logic built in.  And you can still probably get around it if you really try.<p>2.  There is a disproportionate amount of cheap gear and old gear in circulation.  We didn&#x27;t get &quot;smart&quot; rigs until the late 90s at a minimum, and even so they are vastly outnumbered by stuff from the glory days of the 50s, 60s, and 70s.  There has always been a relatively small amount of high-power stuff in circulation, and there&#x27;s even less smart high-power stuff.  A lot of the modern kit-built stuff like the Elecraft K2 focuses on QRP (effective operation on low power) instead of crazy high output.<p>3.  This manifests as a CRAZY price curve.  It&#x27;s relatively easy to get an old radio from the 70s that&#x27;ll do 50 or 100W (especially after factoring in weak, aging tubes, etc).  A modern mini-rig that will do 25W or something is also relatively affordable.  But if you want something new, powerful, or new AND powerful you can easily jump into the thousands of dollars.  For the cost of a modern rig that&#x27;ll do any given power level, you can afford an older rig and an amp that will put out an equally good signal with substantially more power.  Or with a better antenna.  And so on.<p>4.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the old gear and things like tubes can be fixed.  If you trash your new wünder-rig it&#x27;s garbage.  So given that amateurs are crafty people (the proto-hacker, really) there&#x27;s a strong incentive to make the old or lower-power stuff work, because it&#x27;s repairable when it breaks.",1442874638

Oranges, while a pretty hardy fruit, have a shelf life of, at most, a few weeks at room temperature, according to multiple sources. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;d be great sitting around in a cargo ship, with uncertain temperature and humidity changes for a month. So let&#x27;s fly them over. Here&#x27;s a calculator: <a href=""http://www.worldfreightrates.com/en/freight"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldfreightrates.com/en/freight</a><p>I calculated $154.74 - $171.02 per carton. That&#x27;s quite a hefty premium on a carton of oranges (about 100 oranges, according to multiple sources). Sure, you might argue that a benevolent organization could come along and send bulk pallets (unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would let me calculate the costs for a pallet of oranges), but I doubt you&#x27;re going to find more than a 20% costs savings -- competition in this industry is stiff, and jet fuel is expensive.<p>In Boston, can buy navel oranges at my local grocery store for a dollar an orange, or less (I just checked Peapod!). So, yeah, it literally costs more to ship an orange across the ocean than oranges here cost, even with the relatively high cost of labor in the US. As wealthy Americans, we frequently pay for exotic foods (bananas in the middle of winter!) that cost very little to produce, and we&#x27;re paying almost entirely for shipping. We don&#x27;t think much about shipping costs, or think that it&#x27;s unusual to get our food shipped to us, but that sort of thinking is dangerous.<p>It&#x27;s far far cheaper to grow more food in starving countries than it is to ship them food. In Kenya, and all over Africa, food prices are much cheaper than they are here, even on open markets with relatively inefficient food delivery practices. It is cheaper (not to mention more environmentally sound!) to produce the food there, than it is to produce it here, and then transport it there. You make no sense. I mean, people in many African countries (let&#x27;s be honest, Kenya is one of the wealthier ones) commonly feed their entire families on just a few dollars a day -- why not compost the fucking oranges, send them the money we would have spent on spilling fuel into the atmosphere, invigorate their economy, and let them eat like kings for the cost of flying over three oranges?<p>Saying &quot;Now I understand there would be a cost in transporting these goods, as well as other factors, but still...&quot; is just irresponsible. Yes, seeing oranges go to waste makes you feel bad. But the solution is not to ship it outside the relatively small radius where it makes environmental and economic sense to do so, when there are many other solutions for hunger that don&#x27;t waste resources and kill the environment faster.",1442873905

I really don&#x27;t know where my thinking diverges from the accepted legal consensus, and wasn&#x27;t sure if it hinged upon that exact phrasing somehow.<p>> <i>As for the rest, you want to read a very broad definition of script into it. ... Data files they [scripts] use, unless covered otherwise, would not be covered. ... Most lawyers take a pretty strict definition of script</i><p>Concretely, per your narrow definition of &quot;script&quot; (which I am understanding as anything a programmer would call &quot;a script&quot;, correct me if you have something more formal), a makefile is not a script. neither is some C with a sequence of system(&quot;...) commands, and neither is something piped through rot13 to sh, nor a sequence of commands in a free-form text file that are copy and pasted into an interactive shell.<p>As a result, the word &quot;script&quot; is essentially meaningless in the legal context, due to the technical transformations that can be done on any script that makes it not a &quot;script&quot; - computer science is a <i>playground</i> of made up words and endless reinvention.<p>I had the impression that courts looked at general concepts and frowned upon attempts to circumvent the intent of contracts; is this not so?<p>> <i>what if my script requires a special fuse plugin for my company&#x27;s magic distributed file system that i store all this stuff on, and becomes worthless without it. Do you believe i have to give you the plugin?</i><p>Doesn&#x27;t this <i>strongly</i> come down to intent? If the company just happens to use some internal filesystem that differs radically from POSIX, and their engineers really do work on the program using it (rather than some obfuscation game), then I don&#x27;t see them being compelled to rework the source tree into POSIX conventions. But if the file system is adopted and integrated specifically so the company can avoid its obligations under the license, isn&#x27;t it likely that a court would call them out on it?<p>Stepping back, doesn&#x27;t copyright law <i>by default</i> essentially mean most things added to a build are derative works, and also the final executable itself is a derivative work? The GPL2 has explicit exemptions for operating system components and &quot;mere aggregation&quot;, plus further exemptions when combining with non-GPL works (eg Classpath and OpenSSL). Otherwise, these uses would run afoul of copyright. Presumably the GPL2 says &quot;scripts&quot; as distinct from <i>data</i> which is already covered since it gets incorporated into the final executable work.<p>I would think if you played a similar game with an independently-developed binary code blob - prepending it to compiled GPL source - you would be shot down pretty quickly since the entire executable is one derivative work. Don&#x27;t binary kernel drivers only legally work as modules precisely because the resulting in-memory derivative is never distributed?<p>How does the scenario of incorporating such a machine code blob differ from creating a signature blob and inserting it into the executable&#x27;s header?",1442873432

Certainly many companies desire to pay for commercial support for many OSS projects, but by the same token, it&#x27;s obvious that there are some projects that nobody is paying for support for.<p>In my experience, when companies pay for commercial support, it&#x27;s ultimately about paying for the comfort factor of knowing that somebody is &quot;on the hook&quot; to fix things if the shit hit the fan.  There&#x27;s a certain level of &quot;CYA&quot; in there as well.

OTOH, if their is a vendor behind the product, and they are called in the fix the problem -- and even if the company <i>still</i> loses money -- the vendor absorbs the blame.<p>Like others have said though, it depends on how complex the software is, what it does, whether or not the firm has deep knowledge of the product already on staff, etc.<p>Beyond that, a few more thoughts:  subscriptions for OSS software, ala the way Red Hat work, are desirable in many ways.  For example, with a subscription, you know you always get the latest version as long as your subscription is up to date, so no &quot;big bucks&quot; version upgrades are required.  You&#x27;re also paying with future, inflated, dollars as opposed to todays dollars which are more valuable (assuming the economy doesn&#x27;t go delfationary).  It also aligns incentives between the vendor and the customer, as the vendor has to continue to provide a solid, functional, operational product, for the company to keep renewing their subscription.<p>Of course all that&#x27;s true even if the software is proprietary, but the subscription model seems really popular for OSS stuff.",1442872949

For systems distributed among multiple datacenters, availability is almost guaranteed unless a global catastrophe causes a global Internet partition (such as Eurasia and America no longer being connected).<p>The only issues, again, are that it&#x27;s more expensive because you need more nodes and redundant networking and that it&#x27;s slower because nodes have to communicate among each other before commits can be confirmed, especially if that needs to be done across datacenters. In particular, write throughput does not necessarily scale with more nodes in a consistent system, since all writes could modify the same value (after reading it) and that&#x27;s not parallelizable in the general case.",1442872868

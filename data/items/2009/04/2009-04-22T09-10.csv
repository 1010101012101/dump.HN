573724,comment,573479,573555,0,0,mustpax,,,"Let's play with a little bit of symbolic logic. Near the end of the article the founders talk say, if your life falls apart then you can't count that as success. Well, you need a little bit of revenue for your life to not fall apart. We can distill that down to:<p><pre><code>  If no revenue, then no success
</code></pre>
The contrapositive of which is:<p><pre><code>  If success, then revenue
</code></pre>
Then given our previous theorem:<p><pre><code>  If (Users and Hard Work) then Success.
</code></pre>
Causality is commutative, so we can just substitute our earlier result:<p><pre><code>  If (Users and Hard Work) then Revenue.
</code></pre>
Thus we get Revenue in to that equation. This ought to work, at least in theory :)",1240394109

The difference could power a Stirling Engine (some of which are powered on differences of as little as .5 degrees C).  It seems to me you could use a captive bolt pistol to get down just a few hundred meters, carrying a plastic tube which would have two chambers.  The engine would pump the water and generate additional electricity.  What do you guys think?",1240393892

573713,comment,573125,573125,0,0,lifeisstillgood,,,"I think it is interesting to hear from the other side of the fence every so often, but the proposed plan is sub-optimal.  I would like to suggest what I think is a better model.<p>The ""Sampo solution"" to licensing (each foundry holds a page listing which domains are allowed to use a font) is frankly unworkable.<p>Imagine if helvetica was licensed this way - on every web page more or less.  Every time a browser visited a new domain it would need to download a very big file from a foundry website (there are how many domains? What does a ten million line file cost to download on a mobile?).  And what about the TTL for that list, make it a week and every browser around the world needs to download it all again.  Even Google would sag under that kind of load.<p>The first idea that comes to mind is to just replace the ""root table"" with a y/n call - here is my webpage, here is the font name, can i use it.  This does not really solve the problem - it reduces traffic sure, but the issue is that if i visit domain x I automatically need to visit another domain, that may or may not be available.  Its inelegant, its inefficient and its insecure.  The web would effectively 'not work' if a big foundry said 'no to all'.  And that is a big ransom demand to put in anyones hands.  And I strongly suspect there is a really powerful cross-site scripting vulnerability sitting in there.<p>It also works against the foundries - the solution decides the licensing.  There is just one kind of license - per domain.  No sophistication, no negotiation. What if you only want to license your font for my mobile readers.  What if you want to license it for the first 100,000 views for free as a taster, then stick it to me.  What if everyone hosted on rackspace servers gets it.  The technology should limit the business options as little as possible.<p>Ok, what do you suggest then ?<p>I prefer a slightly more network-friendly solution.  There are not that many foundries (certainly orders of magnitude less than  domains) so it is quite feasible for them all to put public root certificates in browsers, or at worst run shared CAs.  The technology is already there for SSL.  Then each website who wants to license a .wtf (great name!) file pays their money and gets a signed (hashed) license file which sits next to robots.txt.  The browser downloads the web page, the font and then decrypts the license file with the known public key.<p>The license file is then located where it should be, on the site with the font, and we can trust the license file is genuine.  If its out of date thats the webmasters problem.<p>The license file could hold<p>- domains allowed
- servers / ips allowed
- license type
- an extensible other data section.<p>The license type would need to be pre-agreed with the browsers, the first obvious one is per domain.  But any number of types (lets say one byte or 255) could be invented as the browser manufacturers and foundries talk.<p>This solution has a lot more going for it.<p>We avoid the horrors of mass file downloads, of out of date caches causing havoc and of finding that we put the entire web under the control of one small group of font designers.(I am sure they are lovely people each and every one, in fact thats why i dont want to do it. Imagine the stress of avoiding that temptation, lets not put them through it, the dears.)<p>It also follows the same approach as has been proven to work with ssl for a dozen years, and reuses technology instead of inventing it.<p>The downsides - well font designers are asking web browser manufacturers to enforce their copyright.  If they get it, the exact same approach can be used for, well anything.  If youtube has not got right license file, no playing.  Seems like a can of worms to me, and I suspect I would not want to do it if I were Apple or Mozilla.<p>Anyway, my two cents.<p>[edit:removed a comment that might be a bit flame-y]",1240393079

Your third paragraph is a coy refusal to support the argument in the second half of the second paragraph.

While sound & fury may grab eyeballs, he is ignoring solutions already in front of his face[2].<p><i>The Solution</i><p>==============<p>I worked with fonts and licensing all the time in a previous job, generating automated artwork. The big thing missing in Open Source [his 'usable'] fonts is kerning and hinting.<p>There is nothing stopping someone setting up a Kern-or-Not? website where web people vote on which kerning values look best, and incorporating that data set into an OSS font foundry[3].<p>I already did some of this myself to kern HTML using spans with negative margins. To get excellent results you only need a few key characters [in English]. I used Web fonts, but made up the kerning offsets by trial and error. There is nothing stopping other people doing the same [see 2].<p>'T', 'W' are the big offenders. You can get excellent results concentrating on these and all the vowels.<p>T e , T o , T y , T i , T e, W * etc. This is not exhaustive.<p>-------------------------<p>[1] I came across his emails all the time when I was working on the OSS Greasemonkey in the early days of its development. He threatened the lead dev with 'forking the project and working on it until the day I die' if the project did not take a direction he wanted. I believe it was another of one of the fequent LGPL/GPL arguments that whirlwind in many OSS projects. The mailing list greasemonkey-[user|dev] doesn't seem to include such old emails [c 2005], so no link, sorry.<p>[2] Mark seems to prefer that other people fix the problems under his guidance.<p>[3] May I suggest Public Domain for the dataset to avoid horrendous license choice debates?",1240392060

573698,comment,569675,572963,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Given the size of its team, DTrace would never have succeeded as a
library with bindings to even one dynamic language like Python because
the support burden of doing that is enormous.  Developing, maintaining
and testing dynamic language bindings on multiple platforms has got to
be one of the suckiest programming tasks in the industry.  Just ask
anyone who has ever had to support a PyQT or PyWx application on
multiple platforms.  There's a good reason why Python's only stable 
cross-platform gui is the one whose underlying gui library has been
dead for a decade.<p>Maintaining cross-platform bindings to a popular dynamic language like
Python, Ruby or Perl is like fighting a war on three fronts.  You have
to expose the basic features of the library in a useful way while the
os vendors are breaking things in their zeal to support new features
and and hardware while at the same time the dynamic language
developers languages are ""improving"" their languages in significant
semantic ways.<p>In contrast the DTrace developers and porters only need to worry about
kernel internals - the D language is trivial to maintain and nobody
who matters in that community wants it to be anything other than what
it is: a tool for admins to find out who or what to blame when
something isn't working as it should.  The people who love DTrace the
most and are willing to part with their cash for it aren't programmers
or hackers, they're DBAs and storage guys who get wet dreams about
stability, uptime and security who don't tolerate willy-nilly changes
to things that work for them and worrying that D will evolve too quickly
is like worrying about the something like gdb command set will get out
of control.",1240391480

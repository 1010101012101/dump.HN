The fault in this argument is that idea #1 can come about through other means, such as legal immigration, and applying the same logic would result in the conclusion that legal immigration is bad, which would be a far less popular idea (even amongst the 'kill the illegals' crowd).<p>The underlying theme here, though is resistance to change.",1310428726

What I care about is for IE visitors to see rounded corners. There are ways to execute them, none of which is too complicated, most are butt ugly in terms of involved markup, but they <i>work</i>. That's all that matters.<p>> <i>IE users are used to a crappy web experience, I'm stuck on IE 7 all day at my day job and a very large number of sites simple don't work.</i><p>This is irrelevant. There is me, a guy with a product, and there is my audience. Why the heck would I want to be like other poor sobs that cannot make a website look decent in IE? What sort of backward justification is that? Especially if I am seeing a good chunk of my visitors using IE.<p>> <i>short of rebuilding the entire site with dozens of little images</i><p>You do what you gotta to do <i>if</i> you happen to value your IE visitors' experience. What are several dozens little images compared to stunned visitors' jaws dropping on the floor and their hands reaching for the wallets? :)<p>> <i>we'd treat the same problem with a traditional desktop graphics app -- Level Of Detail.</i><p>Do name a couple of such apps. Short of games I cannot think of any.<p>> <i>Our philosophy is to spend our dev cycles making good software rather than trying to coax a black and white tv to show color.</i><p>Sure thing, it's your decision, but as they say - <i>first impression lasts</i> and <i>presentation matters</i>.",1310428681

If you have a dud bomb (one with no photon detector) then the wave function is propagating along two paths simultaneously and you get interference. If you have a real bomb (one with a photon detector) then it interacts with the wave function in such a way that the photon can only take one of the two paths and you no longer get interference.

I've gone to big concerts and fired it up. I've been to Disneyland and fired it up (don't laugh, other social-place apps are _huge_ at Disneyland. Foursquare gets massive traffic from The Mouse). All of these places, you would think there would be _something_ on Color.  Nothing.  Just that silly black screen with the guy taking the picture of the other guy's crotch. (Cannot unsee that image from the startup, now, thanks)<p>It's like the guys at Color built the product on the assumption that hundreds of millions of people would use it on day one. I'm sure the app works great in the densest portions of the Bay Area on Friday night after a Foocamp, but it is just absolutely useless on any kind of day-to-day, social sort of usage.<p>Path isn't much better, but at the very least I can see that there were photos last shared 21 days ago from friends, so there's at least a _little_ temptation to, you know, _actually use the app_. For all the love about Color's technology, I don't believe that they have gotten anything right at all. It would be so, so easy to just dynamically expand the breadth of the ""anonymous social network"" created around your phone, but the FAQ page is like a winning card for Web 2.0 Social Media Bullshit Bingo.<p>Seriously, here's the tagline for Color:<p>""It also means that any photo taken within about 150ft. of other users of the Color app are automatically shared to their devices.""<p>There you go. One Geospatial query, form upload, and fancy Objective-C frontend, and you have Color.",1310425381

I saw the COPYING file, but since I'm not a legal expert (and since I am considering using this as part of a big project), I was looking for a declaration of a specific license rather than a few terms. Plus, I'm not that familiar with Github so I thought maybe I was simply not seeing a ""license"" section.  Anyhow, thanks.",1310425362

I was talking about it in a job-creation sense.<p>Yes, wealthy individuals will put the money into stocks, bonds, or bank accounts - not under the mattress.  But public companies' market cap rising a bit has a much less direct effect on jobs than creation of demand for local goods and services.  Putting extra cash in a bank account is even worse -- a much simpler way of getting banks to lend is to reduce the prime rate, not to increase the savings rate.",1310425305

Customers for our enterprise health information exchange products absolutely do rate us against our competitors on features. Customers have evaluation committees go through and rate us on long lists of features, and knock off points if the competitor has something we don't. There are other factors in the purchasing decision but it's just naive to think that you don't have to compete on features.\n(And no, we can't sell a simpler product to individual consumers. No point in that.)",1310425295

Wikipedia's ""Reseller"" article explains it better than I can:<p>""Resellers are known to conduct operations on the Internet through sites on the web.\nFor example, this occurs where individuals or companies act as agents for ICANN accredited registrars. They either sell on commission or for profit and in most cases, but not all, the purchase from the registrar and the sale to the ultimate buyer occurs in real time. These resellers are not to be confused with speculators, who purchase many domain names with the intention of holding them and selling them at some future time at a profit. Resellers, by the very nature of their business are retailers.""",1310425257

9064921,comment,9063216,9064537,0,0,xenophonf,,,"Right now, there&#x27;s only a single package repository for each major FreeBSD release.  The ABI doesn&#x27;t normally change within major releases, so packages built on FreeBSD 10.0 will work on FreeBSD 10.1 (and vice verse).<p>A pkgng repository can contain older versions of packages, but &quot;/latest&quot; is tree of symlinks to the most recent versions in the repo.<p>The FreeBSD Ports Tree isn&#x27;t tagged, so there&#x27;s nothing equivalent to updates or backports.  Sometimes, that means packages won&#x27;t build on older (or newer) versions of FreeBSD, or it means that the ports infrastructure as a whole won&#x27;t work properly once you go more than a few releases back.  The FTP archive keeps copies of binary packages included with past FreeBSD releases (all the way back to 1.0).  Generally, that means everyone using the latest version of Firefox from ports on FreeBSD 9.x, 10.x, and 11.x are going to be running Firefox 35.0.1_1,1.  The ports maintainer might include FreeBSD release-specific patches in the package build scripts to handle any differences among currently (or formerly) supported FreeBSD releases.<p>I don&#x27;t remember what universe or multiverse contain.  If those are the ones that have stuff separated out based on the software package&#x27;s licensing, ports/pkgng includes logic to handle EULA acceptance for non-free stuff.  You can also configure it to _not_ accept a license, in which case packages that use a rejected license will fail to build.<p>Regarding jails, please see &quot;man pkg&quot;.  You can give pkgng a jail name or ID, and it will automatically connect to that jail to perform whatever task you asked of it.<p>apt-get update == pkg update (&quot;man pkg-update&quot;), usually unnecessary<p>apt-get upgrade == pkg upgrade (&quot;man pkg-upgrade&quot;), automatically updates the repo metadata by default<p>apt-get purge == pkg delete <pkgname> (&quot;man pkg-delete&quot;)<p>apt-get autoclean == pkg autoremove (&quot;man pkg-autoremove&quot;)<p>apt-cache showpkg == pkg info <pkgname> (&quot;man pkg-info&quot;)<p>apt-cache search == pkg search <pattern> (&quot;man pkg-search&quot;)<p>dpkg-reconfigure does not have an equivalent on FreeBSD.  FreeBSD in general takes a default-deny stance on things, so post-package setup usually has to be handled by the sysadmin.  There are a few packages that do some interactive post-install setup, but I personally consider this a huge bug (e.g., mail/postfix).  Port maintainers generally display post-install setup instructions instead.  You can read these via &quot;pkg info&quot;.  I use the Salt configuration management system, personally.<p>As for documentation, the FreeBSD Handbook or manual pages are always the first places you should look.  There&#x27;s also some info about pkgng on the wiki, but it&#x27;s pretty dated as at this point, all of that stuff has been merged into FreeBSD.",1424206699

9064872,comment,9064257,9064257,0,0,jdietrich,,,"I believe it all boils down to the facts revealed by the Millennium Challenge 2002, a massive battle exercise conducted by the US military. The exercise simulated a conflict between the US (&#x27;blue force&#x27;) and a hypothetical middle-eastern nation (&#x27;red force&#x27;).<p>During the exercises, the red leader (Lt. Gen. Paul van Riper) used asymmetric warfare strategies, designed to exploit weaknesses in US military doctrine. Rather than using radio and risking eavesdropping, orders were sent via motorcycle courier and signal lamps. Rather than squaring up along battlelines, the red team used hit-and-run attacks, including suicide bombings. After massive losses for the blue team, the exercise was reset and the red leader was ordered to follow a preordained script to ensure a blue victory. The exercise was deemed a complete success.<p>The US military learned absolutely nothing from this exercise, and continued to make exactly the same mistakes in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is a doctrinal belief in the &#x27;correct&#x27; way to win a war, and the notion that technological and logistical advantages can guarantee victory in any conflict. US military strategy is designed to justify procurement decisions post-hoc, rather than actually win wars. We invest heavily in eavesdropping infrastructure, <i>therefore</i> it is strategically invaluable. We have a fleet of multirole fighters, <i>therefore</i> air supremacy is a vital objective. There is an ideological drive to transform all warfare into the bloodless technological dispute of the cold war, regardless of reality.<p>To quote Lt. Gen. van Riper:<p>&quot;My experience has been that those who focus on the technology, the science, tend towards sloganeering. There&#x27;s very little intellectual content to what they say, and they use slogans in place of this intellectual content. It does a great disservice to the American military, the American defense establishment. &#x27;Information dominance,&#x27; &#x27;network-centric warfare,&#x27; &#x27;focused logistics&#x27;—you could fill a book with all of these slogans.<p>What I see are slogans masquerading as ideas. In a sense, they make war more antiseptic. They make it more like a machine. They don&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s a terrible, uncertain, chaotic, bloody business. So they can lead us the wrong way.

Many applications, such as DJ software and vector graphics software, can benefit from integration with input devices. But this leaves manufacturers with a choice:<p>1. Force users to buy the controller, with the software (which adds cost, and may dissuade many potential buyers, as well as limit customers to <i>your</i> controller).\n2. Use existing input hardware (keyboard/mouse) (which leads to an inferior user experience).\n3. Offload this choice onto the user, who can start with the existing input hardware and later switch to the specialized controllers. However, this requires supporting two systems, and sometimes the poor user experience from using the default controllers will prevent potential users from using the software with the specialized controllers.<p>Sprout sidesteps this problem completely by allowing software definition of controllers. I think the big problem HP will run into is that if other manufacturers don&#x27;t create similar products, HP will have a difficult time getting software developers to develop for the Sprout because it would lock them into HPs platform.",1424206134

9064804,comment,9062733,9064469,0,0,will_brown,,,">The IRS contractor rules are the most important employee classification rules with any bearing on this discussion, and they are both clear and very well-understood by employers.<p>You can not say IRS rules are more important than State case law for purposes of classification or this discussion.  Such a statement shows the law is anything but clear.  Federal/State classifications are an independent determination and require separate analysis.<p>Example, say A hires B as an Independent Contractor, having focused on complying with only the Federal factors, then B sues A at the State level after being was injured on the job claiming A misidentified B, whereas B claims he was really an employee and should receive workers comp.  The Court is not going to apply the Federal Rules/Law they will apply the State Law, in fact we can go ahead and assume B was correctly a Independent Contractor at the Federal Level, but the Court could find under State Law B was classified and the relationship was that of employee/employer now A is liable for failing to comply with State Law and have to pay B&#x27;s workers comp.  This is the exact type of lawsuit that could be replicated hundreds or thousands of times sinking any Start-up, who fails to comply with any aspect of the classification paradigm.<p>>I am not a lawyer, but I am something like 99.999% sure that 1099&#x27;ing an LLC does very little to ensure that a contractor can&#x27;t be retroactively classified as an FTE for whom W2 withholding was required.<p>As I said you are correct, just because you pay a company rather than a individual does not automatically make that an Independent Contractor relationship, but it is one factor.  For example, in the Florida Worker&#x27;s Compensation Statute (which provides its own factors, separate from both Florida Case Law and the IRS 20 Factors) factor number 2 reads:<p>&quot;(II) The independent contractor holds or has applied for a federal employer identification number...&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0440/Sections/0440.02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Displ...</a>",1424205632

It seems nicely designed and is also understandable for a newcomer in FP.<p>Some things that would interest me but which I couldn&#x27;t figure out from these docs are:<p>1. Will sending something to a Channel or the DOM event that causes the send to the channel (e.g. onClick (send channel Decrement) in the example) be executed synchronously (aka direct function calls in the transpiled JS) or asynchronously (signal processing in the subscriber is deferred, e.g. with settimeout). If it&#x27;s deferred, can it really be guaranteed that for example a button could only be pressed once (with direct calls you could disable it immediatly in the onClick listener) or other actions which you might want to see immediatly?<p>2. Are there any concepts around cancellation? E.g. in one other example there was a textbox whose text-changed signal triggered the downloading of images which were shown in another view. There old pictures were still shown despite the input has changed already again because they are in the HTTP response signal at some point of time. I guess you would have to create and map a new HTTP signal each time the input change and disconnect the old one. But this seems like against the proposed architecture.",1424205599

Almost all of the advice is applicable to one situation or another (except possibly &quot;take drugs&quot; -- REALLY??)<p>In this particular case, I think the problem was the choice to prioritize other people&#x27;s needs over my own -- even my own work tasks.  The combination of stress and constant interruption was causing fatigue beyond what would normally be warranted by the actual amount of time I&#x27;ve been spending working (a bit more than is sustainable, but only for a few days so far) and sleeping (as much as usual).  After a day of being deliberately selfish, I&#x27;m in a slightly better place.<p>To answer some of the questions and concerns brought up:<p>We have a deadline based on a 3rd-party real-world event.  The deadline is non-negotiable. To a certain degree, feature set/which bugs we fix are.<p>I&#x27;m the project manager as well as a developer, so I&#x27;m not free from blame for the tight deadline.  That said, we were on track to complete the project weeks ahead of schedule until a couple of critical features were delayed by unavailability of a crucial resource (despite my protests) until way later in the schedule than should have been acceptable.<p>In part, I&#x27;m working so hard in order to shield the team as much as possible from the consequences of my mistakes and the above-mentioned resource allocation error, which are not their fault.  I&#x27;m demanding this of myself far more than my employer is demanding it of me, because I don&#x27;t want to let these people down.

Professional audio engineers with degrees in physics or engineering are not fools, and they do not do critical listening through $130 headphones and whatever converter and amp happens to be on their device.

Your preconceived notion about the worst problem shouldn&#x27;t stop someone else from talking about a different one. If you looked you will notice that other than quoting complaints at the beginning, the vast majority of the article ignores costs. They speak only of effects.<p>It is easier to question military spending by first pointing out why throwing money at problems isn&#x27;t working, since you can&#x27;t easily quantify the benefit of the military you can&#x27;t just apply cost benefit analysis and have a convincing argument.<p>> 75% of servants in army (support roles) is pretty stable number since Roman Legions times.<p>And that number works great in Roman style conflicts. When you have a force power huge logistic lines make a great target, refocusing your logistics is a way to minimize that weakness.<p>> Fighting street by street, block by block takes large number of men.<p>You assume that is the ideal method of fighting the conflict.<p>> Army should not do police work. There should be para-military units (gendarme) composed from locals, but from different regions. US did great job at Philippines with this strategy.<p>You didn&#x27;t actually disagree with him here but frame it as if you did. He said they sucked at understanding local needs but acted on what information they had. You said that they shouldn&#x27;t act on local things.<p>> I will take any US &#x27;war hawk&#x27; over this guy anytime.

Knowing that Cairene Arabic is vastly different from that of Southern Iraq, I asked him if he had any trouble understanding the local dialect.  He shook his head. “I have no idea what they are saying. I have a much easier time understanding you.”  His English was excellent, which is presumably why he got the job, but his comprehension of Basrawi Arabic was almost nonexistent.  But Marine officers, who inevitably spoke no Arabic, depended on him to explain what the locals were trying to tell them. Since the interpreter just made up what he thought his bosses wanted to hear, the Marines were operating with negative intelligence.</i><p>As good a synopsis of the last 60 years of this country&#x27;s foreign policy, as any.",1424203501

We&#x27;ll assume 50%.  That means they cost $200/kWh in actual capacity.<p>At 50% depth of discharge a lead acid battery will only get about 1000 cycles before it&#x27;s not very useful anymore and needs to be replaced.<p>$200 / 1000 cycles = $0.20 per kWh per cycle.<p>That&#x27;s the fixed cost of a lead acid battery.  Every time you charge and discharge it, you&#x27;ve lost $0.20 per kWh in terms of the capital cost of the battery.  This has nothing to do with the price of power, but it has to do with the depreciation of the asset.<p>Okay so now let&#x27;s deal with power cost.  It&#x27;s 14p to buy low, 19p to sell high.  Since I&#x27;m in the US I&#x27;m going to convert that to dollars at the rate of about 1.5 which means that the MOST money you can hope to make on the arbitrage of low price to high price is $0.06<p>Now let us compare $0.20 per cycle of cost with $0.06 per cycle of revenue (again ignoring the fact that in reality nothing is 100% efficient) and we can easily see that this is a losing proposition.  It&#x27;ll lose AT LEAST $0.14 per kWh per cycle for the person trying to operate this arbitrage scheme as a business and they&#x27;ll soon go bankrupt.  Problem solved.<p>Now if the cheap power was $0.01 and the expensive power was $0.50 then they might be able to make money.  But from what I understand of the power pricing, that&#x27;s not the case.<p>If you&#x27;d like to continue to argue, please do so with actual numbers that mean something and/or are based on reality, rather than belligerent trolling.

978950,comment,978643,978643,0,0,mpk,,,"Ever since Google announced Android I predicted that it would become a dominant mobile environment. We're not there yet, but it's becoming increasingly evident that Android is here to stay.<p>It shares a lot of similarities with linux. That linux hasn't become dominant on the desktop can (to a large extent) be attributed to the entrenched desktop market where people and organizations use the same system (and applications) over many years.<p>Mobile doesn't have that yet. People switch phones every year or so and are used to them all being different. Vendors can therefore pretty much pick a new OS every few years (I'm simplifying this, of course).<p>When selecting a new OS, vendors will evaluate two main elements - price and control. Pricing usually being bound to licenses (a form of control held by a third party), it usually just boils down to control.<p>And what does Android offer? Control over everything vendors care about. For the companies involved, software development is cheap, but not so cheap that they can just build an OS from scratch (hi there Palm!). Also, Android is low on legacy and fully web-ified (sorry for using that word).<p>Sure, you love your iPhone. Spare me the feedback. I get forwarded loads of links telling me how crap Android systems are compared to Apple's stuff. But that's just Apple with Apple hardware, Apple software and hard contracts for the carriers. All the other vendors are hell-bent on breaking that. With Android Google (who is not a vendor in this space) is basically flooding that market with free, top-of-the-line R&D on the software end. Of course people building the hardware are going to pick that up.",1260062641

978943,comment,978217,978782,0,0,djcapelis,,,"Actually I would like the ranking algorithm to distinguish between a comment with no votes and a comment with 5 upvotes and 5 downvotes.  I think the latter usually shows the comment is controversial and probably deserves to be displayed as it's likely to be interesting.  This makes it so that people can still use votes as agree/disagree without negatively impacting the quality of the debate.<p>I suppose it depends on whether or not you want to promote controversial discussion, which you may not.  It would be harder to enforce etiquette through downvotes and might bring on eternal september sooner.<p>That said, if you wanted to experiment, one simple way to do this is simply to make the number of points an upvote grants different than the number of points a downvote produces.  Not for purposes of karma, I think HN probably does that right now, but simply for purposes of comment ranking.<p>The downside is jokes that aren't that funny would likely be ranked higher than they should be under this algorithm.

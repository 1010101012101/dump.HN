Everyone complains about the wait time (3 min is too long), but no ones brings up the fact that people routinely wait 15+ minutes for Chipotle. The problem is not time or price, it&#x27;s quality. Give food people are willing to wait for. Anyone who has ordered any of McDonald&#x27;s so-called premium burgers will tell that it&#x27;s the same flavorless hamburger patty found in their other burgers just served in a different bun. Not worth the wait, or the price.<p>IMO, the drive-through was the double edged sword that ultimately brought down McDonald&#x27;s. People in cars don&#x27;t want to wait. Speeding up production lead to lower quality. You already saw it happen with Starbucks. These articles always reference Chipotle, and I hope Chipotle never has drive-through.<p>As for a solution, I never understood why McDonald&#x27;s the company is required to operate McDonald&#x27;s the restaurant. Instead of turning McDonalds into Chipotle and Starbucks, just create a new restaurant that more directly competes. Change McDonald&#x27;s restaurants to focus on core products, and offer wraps and burritos in some other venue. Buy that company if you have to.",1425901861

I like to believe the reason for this is that my tongue was a little more sensitive than normal and so I often got &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by sugary foods and simply started avoiding them (I still do). Grownups used to tease me about this whenever candy came up, they were flabbergasted that a child would reject candy as a reward or present for doing something. What? A kid that wouldn&#x27;t do anything for a candy bar? Impossible.<p>I also avoid soft drinks like Coca-Cola because they produce an almost allergic reaction with my tongue (it aches for the rest of the day) though that might just be the preservatives. As a result I mostly stick to &quot;vanilla&quot; foods and drinks as I like to call them, like plain water and milk.<p>I might be wrong and still be getting too much unhealthy sugars and stuff from other food, but I&#x27;d like to think that it&#x27;s not so severe since I live in Finland and not the US.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the worst idea ever, but I think there is risk involved. The kind of person that would use a phrase like &quot;real rape&quot; s the kind of person that would use the new term to minimize the experience. And, there is also risk in saying that rape that does not include bruises, blood, kicking, screaming, etc. is not violent, which is probably the biggest problem with using terminology like &quot;violent rape&quot; and &quot;not violent rape&quot;, because all rape is an act of violence.<p>And, just in case there is any thought that I am exaggerating about the existence of assholes who would claim rape without obvious violence isn&#x27;t really ape.

It&#x27;s beyond naive to think women only judge men based on their brains and men only judge women based on their figure.<p>My point is that at some point the crusaders on both sides of this should step back and realize that most of us actually have dealt discrimination and harassment to some degree, and I think the best solutions actually don&#x27;t involve putting women up on pedestals or men in gags and blindfolds.<p>I think your belief that women are judged more superficially than men is driven more from mass media than scientific fact.",1425899400

9170279,comment,9167781,9168117,0,0,Al-Khwarizmi,,,"I play and love both Go and MtG, and I think your assessment of MtG is not fair. The thing about MtG is that the real fun is not as much in playing the game itself but in the deck building. When I&#x27;m playing a game of MtG, I&#x27;m not thinking only about the current game or how to win it, but rather which cards/combos are working well, which are not working, what cards I should use instead, etc. to improve my deck for the next game.<p>Finding interesting combos among the thousands of existing MtG cards is also very fun and cannot be done in a minimalistic game with a very small number of components like Go. They are just games with different goals and scopes.<p>What I dislike about the evolution of MtG is the placeholder words that they constantly add to the rules, e.g. &quot;lifelink&quot; for &quot;damage dealt by this creature also causes you to gain that much life&quot;. Cards with that ability existed before the word was introduced, so the word is unnecessary, it just makes the text of the cards shorter... but the constant extensions of the vocabulary make the rules harder to understand and remember. The <i>actual</i> rules are still mostly like in the nineties... in fact most, if not all, of the <i>actual</i> rule changes have been simplifications rather than complications (mana burn removed, meh). But they just like to make up unnecessary words, it&#x27;s a pity.",1425899174

Just a handful to get acquainted with the rules.<p>Playing against computers will teach you bad habits and will not be helpful past the very basics. If you want to do exercises, try e.g. Tsumego (for Android at least).<p>And the best way to get started is to find your local Go club, take a friend with similar level to you (ie. complete novice) and join their game night (my local go clubs meet in bars).

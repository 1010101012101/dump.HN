One suggestion would be to cut down on the text in the bubbles and move from paragraph form to something closer to bullet points.<p>When I saw the page, the bubbles were the first thing my eyes were drawn to, so they really ought to provide a light and easy overview.  Once you've sparked peoples' interest, you have all page to feed them text, but a cluttered first impression is a large turn off.<p>Edit:
As I look at the site some more, I still find that my largest problem is how cluttered everything works.  In particular, articles with a large number of tags tend to really bloat up. It would probably help if they were de-emphasized or boxed up more by default.<p>As far as the functionality goes, it seemed to be fairly good.

Maybe he thinks that Python provides enough features to live without macros, but that's not necessarily true.  Also, macros aren't just for ""custom languages""; sometimes you need to make the details of your programming language (or API) go away for various reasons.  Macros let you do that.<p>Anyway, I've found the lack of macros in other languages unsatisfying.  I can use those languages, and I can build similarly-powerful abstractions... but they don't turn out the way I really want.  So while it's certainly possible to work around the lack of macros, it would definitely be better to have them.",1216950007

256146,comment,255451,256081,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I would argue that eugenics is a valid belief so long as there is at least one trait that 1) is desirable, or correlated with something desirable (e.g. resistance to a disease, stronger work ethic, lower criminality, resistance to sunburns) and 2) is heritable.<p>So I think I've got one! Skin color: people with darker skin are less likely to get sunburns, and darker skin appears to be heritable. So a smart eugenicist who believes that resistance to sunlight is an important trait would encourage darker-skinned people to breed more, at the expense of those of us with lighter hues.<p>I'm sure there are other examples. But given that humans are an evolved species, all I'm saying is that we might be able to outguess chance and know which traits could be useful down the road. In a country with a solid welfare system, the ability to delay gratification is a bad one for your future genes -- if you're busy going to school instead of having unprotected sex, you'll have fewer kids (and they'll have fewer kids, later in life, too). So maybe a eugenic policy would be to subsidize people who have kids above the replacement level after getting their degrees, or who get sterilized if they have a kid when neither parent is employed.",1216949752

You get taxed each year on that $100,000 as income - but you also got taxed when you made that $1,000,000 in the first place.<p>But if you create a business that returns $100,000 pa, while you similarly get taxed on that income, <i>you don't get taxed on the creation of the business</i> - even though it's equivalent to having saved $1,000,000, in terms of its return.<p>And if that doesn't set your heart singing in transcendental joy, it's probably better for you to just do what you love and the money will follow. :-)",1216949531

Since I'm not using Amazon service directly, this might actually be a more fair comparison (AWS by itself is lower level than Heroku and GAE).  I don't plan to switch because I've been having a good experience with Heroku, I happen to know Rails and my project is already well underway.<p>What I <i>would</i> like to see is a functional language supported by a Heroku-type service or on GAE so that I could take the same in-cloud dev approach and learn a new language paradigm at the same time.  I'm impulsive, so right now I'm interested in ErlyWeb.  Python isn't different enough to warrant the jump, so unless I magically hit the level where I will benefit from Big Table (and I don't just use SimpleDB or Heroku doesn't pick up a doc-DB in the meantime), I'm fine where I am.<p>I am very glad they lifted the user limit, however, because I would like to see what the non-early-adopters start to produce.",1211982999

IE 7 is less than Firefox.<p>I found last year when I worked an Ajax project that when I replace DOM that contains images, IE 6/7 will load images twice.

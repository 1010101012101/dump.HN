Devs who openly identify as female face more hostility (technical and otherwise) than those who identify as male or are not identified. The idea of a women's only list is to avoid that hostility and provide a place where they can talk tech without the negative inputs.<p>If the same thing were happening to men, then having an exclusive list would be appropriate there as well.<p>I'm also a white male and still earning nowhere near average wage despite hitting 40 recently, but I'm not blind to having less obstacles to overcome.

A felony is considered a ""high crime"" and is defined as an offense that can yield more than a year of prison time. Felonies require an indictment (basically a preliminary jury hearing to determine if there is sufficient evidence to go to trial), and then a conviction by trial. Felonies generally are much nastier records wise, require more time before they can be sealed or expunged (depending on state law) if they can be at all. They exclude you from certain rights such as gun ownership, voting, holding public office etc automatically. The system is fairly skewed and crimes are often made felonies in a reactionary context, i.e. some trivial computer crimes can yield felonies while cracking another mans skull under the right circumstances may only yield a misdemeanor assault charge after plea bargaining.",1364183762

It's ridiculous and absurd.<p>It's also something that's both new and western.  Programming, as an occupation, used to have a much healthier mix of genders.  Looking at foreign-born computer scientists at my old grad school and at work, the ratio distortion is pretty unique to here.  I donno what the cause is, but it is cultural.  And we don't have enough of a culture for it to be anything more substantial than the accumulation of ""1000 papercuts.""<p>I think it's happening out of a combination of childishness and laziness.  Most of us who repeat the same little phrases like ""so easy my mom can do it"" over and over just do it because we're too lazy to come up with a metaphor of our own.  Here's an example replacement: ""So easy a congressman can do it.""

It's all about being on the right side of optionality :)<p>It's better to own a subsistence farm than to have something which requires purchasing market-priced inputs and to sell at long fixed-term prices.<p>Similarly having long term fixed-rate debt (mortgage) is better in a market where rates go up than having to refinance every few years with short-term debt (or, say, rent, in a place where there's no rent control).  But a disadvantage of owning vs. renting is that you can't move as easily to take advantage of opportunities.<p>Reducing mandatory ongoing/recurring market-rate purchases seems like a win; usually that requires either spending capital now or some form of (ideally, fixed-rate) debt.  Like borrowing at 3% to buy a fuel-efficient car or live close to work/transit is probably worthwhile, if you get 10-15mpg now and need to commute to work.",1364183666

The NUM came in maybe three times a year, for only a couple of minutes. It was just a passing discomfort, but the important thing is this: I never lost tangible power. I didn't work in an environment where it was commonplace. I never felt like I couldn't escape or verbally correct or even physically overpower her if things went too far. There was never a culture of undermining my power that it contributed to. I wasn't seen as more of a 'junior' because of it; it didn't diminish my status.<p>Separate to that, I wouldn't say men have a higher threshold for not complaining about shit that doesn't matter. In some senses they do, and in others they don't - the recent PyCon event showed vast amounts of men in tech providing plenty of vapid, shrill complaints over stuff that really didn't require that level of passion.",1364182950

It's not meant as a personal rejection.  It's more like ""We are a minority and need a place to get away from all of that sometimes"".<p>Try to think of it as getting away from the troubles and stress that come with being a minority in the environment, rather than a way to get away from specific people.<p>And that is why a male only hacker group (for example) wouldn't look good.  There would be no minority environment to try to get away from.  The group would be excluding females simply because they are females.  In order to be less offensive, there must be some other reason for the exclusion.  A mailing list that only allows men suffering from erectile dysfunction probably wouldn't raise too much scorn from anybody.<p>So for any minority-only group, the trick is to accept that there <i>are</i> legitimate difficulties inherent with being part of that minority.

My mom is quite capable, so most anecdotes I have of times I've gained insight into how people use computers when they aren't familiar with them are of other people in my life.  But I do have a few anecdotes about her that I've used.<p>One day someone was Wrong On The Internet and I really wanted to make my point and found myself making my point with a ""mom"" example that had never actually happened with her.  Initially it made me a little uncomfortable, and I thought the discomfort came from representing my mother as less capable than she is.  But I figured I'm anonymous, and since I could be anyone,I'm not really talking about my mom specifically.  ""My mom"" could be any mom and I was conveying something I figured might happen to lots of moms.<p>So I posted it anyway.  It wasn't until later that I realized how extremely obviously sexist and ageist it was. The ONLY reason I was using ""mom"" in that example was to enlist the stereotype that older women aren't adept with technology.  That made me further realize that even when I was using true anecdotes from my life, I was likely motivated to do so because enlisting the stereotype strengthened whatever point I happened to be making.<p>When I read the girlfriend/wife line from the OP I thought the same thing as many responders here do: There's nothing wrong with someone sharing a true fact about their experience being in a relationship with someone that doesn't care as much about technology.  But that can still be sexist if you are unknowingly choosing to share the fact because the point you are making is made stronger by enlisting a stereotype that women don't care about technology.",1364182803

Not stopping unwanted sexual jokes, after someone has complained, is a sign of sexual harassment. The key thing is that someone must complain. To quote the EEOC:<p>""In Commission Decision No. 84-1, CCH Employment Practices Guide  6839, the Commission found that active participation in sexual conduct at the workplace, e.g., by ""using dirty remarks and telling dirty jokes,"" may indicate that the sexual advances complained of were not unwelcome. Thus, the Commission found that no harassment occurred with respect to an employee who had joined in the telling of bawdy jokes and the use of vulgar language during her first two months on the job, and failed to provide subsequent notice that the conduct was no longer welcome. By actively participating in the conduct, the charging party had created the impression among her co-workers that she welcomed the sort of sexually oriented banter that she later asserted was objectionable.

5435218,comment,5432713,5434884,6,0,gnosis,,,"<i>""Did you find any practical purpose to the ""altered"" states of consciousness?""</i><p>Yes.  I found them very useful for understanding myself.  They confronted me with many unpleasant (and pleasant) but important parts of my life and feelings that I was in denial of or just couldn't experience in ordinary consciousness.  They helped me gain a lot of insight in to myself and in to the world.<p>Another benefit was shaking my certainties about what the world was really like.  Up to my first psychedelic experience, I felt pretty comfortable in the world (not that I had a pleasant childhood or life or anything, but I did feel I knew what the world was like, and how to get around in it).  Psychedelics radically changed that.  Even though I'd read a lot about them before I tried them, and was intellectually prepared for what I experienced, actually experiencing it was a different matter entirely.  It's like reading about sex vs actually having sex.  Reading about being in love vs actually being in love.  There's no comparison.<p>Likewise, on psychedelics, suddenly I was not in Kansas anymore (metaphorically speaking).  I learned that reality could be very different from what I take it to be in ordinary consciousness.  And, while in an altered state of consciousness, what I experience could feel ""even more real than real"".  This made me interested in finding out what reality was really like (if that's possible), and led me to become interested in and study philosophy, psychology, and religion.<p>My psychedelic experiences made me much more laid back, less dogmatic, and more accepting of other people and other views of the world.  It also helped a lot with empathy.  During a psychedelic experience, I became much more sensitive to my own body, my own feelings, the feelings of people around me, even the feelings of animals and even inanimate objects, which could become animate or even a part of me.  I experienced the feeling of being one with everything.<p>After coming back to ordinary consciousness, those feelings subsided or disappeared entirely.  Objects certainly became inanimate again.  Still, the thought of the possibility that they were actually animate, and especially the possibility that things like trees might have feelings -- or at the least that I should respect them more than I do, or that they may ""know"" or ""understand"" more than I usually give them credit for, or be able to act in ways that I'm not normally aware of remained.  And I think I am generally more sensitive towards the feelings of other people now, especially if they are in some sort of distress.<p>I came to be open to the possibility that there is a god or gods, or at least some sort of sacred reality beyond the one I had access to in ordinary consciousness.  I did have experiences where I communicated with various entities and gods.  Whether this was real or imaginary I can't say.  But I am now more open to the possibility that something like that could be real, and I am more understanding of those people who have had profound mystical experiences or experiences of meeting or talking to God/gods.<p>Now, I can't give exclusive credit to psychedelics to changing my views on all of these things.  Transitioning to my present views on these subjects took a long time, and my psychedelic experiences took place a very long time ago.  But they opened the door and showed me the way on many of these things.  How ""practical"" these insights and attitudinal changes have been would depend on what you mean by ""practical"".  They certainly have been profound and important to me.  But I can't say I came up with a new invention (as some people have) on psychedelics.  Nor did I solve a math problem using them.  They didn't make me a better coder.  But they were very valuable.<p>Some studies have actually been done on using psychedelics to enhance creativity.  If you are interested, I recommend reading James Fadiman's ""The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide"", and Oscar Janiger's ""LSD, Spirituality, and the Creative Process"".<p>On a humbler note, meditation has helped me to achieve calm (at least while I'm meditating and for some hours afterwards).  I view that as a very practical effect.<p><i>""I would also like to suggest substituting the word ""altered"" with ""disturbed"". Would you mind telling me your thoughts on this (whether in connection with the above question, or not)?""</i><p>I don't like using the word ""disturbed"" for these states.  Certainly, sometimes when in these states one can be confronted with visions or feelings that one finds disturbing.  Aldous Huxley titled a book of his about psychedelics ""Heaven and Hell"", and that is sometimes quite an appropriate description of some of the more extreme experiences that one can have on psychedelics or in other non-ordinary states of consciousness.  However, they are not always hellish, nor always heavenly.  They can be quite unpredictable (especially when used in a haphazard, uninformed, or destructive way).  I would agree that those states are non-ordinary -- in that they differ from the ordinary state of consciousness most of us inhabit during our waking lives.  But to paint them all indiscriminately with the pejorative term ""disturbed"" is to misunderstand their nature.<p>It's also a bit arrogant to put ordinary consciousness up on a pedestal as if it was the ultimate and best form of consciousness and the rest were lacking, wrong, or immoral in some way.  Many Buddhists and Hindus would certainly disagree with anyone who tried to claim that the enlightened state of consciousness was ""disturbed"".  From their perspective, it is the ordinary state of consciousness which is ""disturbed"", and the enlightened state of consciousness that is healthy.  Who are we to insist otherwise?",1364181782

Well no doubt! If you understand how the architecture actually works, it's clear this isn't a fair comparison. mod_php means php is fully-loaded for serving statics, not to mention having a smaller pool of php-fpm processes will take less memory and also be faster (due to less context-switching) than the larger number of mod_php processes.<p>However the real comparison should be between nginx+php-fpm and apache+mpm_event+php-fpm. Nginx is an evented server, so at least try to compare apples-to-apples.  I've seen very few comparisons of nginx with mpm_event.<p>Also, apache's default tunings are much more geared towards modest server usage whereas nginx's seem more geared towards high scalability. An argument could be made that apache should have ""better"" defaults, but since at scale you need to start tweaking your OS/rlimit/etc to prevent bad things from happening you can see why apache might stick with more modest tunings ootb.<p>Our app has a lot of apache custom config and so I was a hesitant to try to switch to nginx due to the risk of getting things wrong porting the configs. We did move from apache/mod_php to apache+mpm_worker and php-fpm and we've been able to improve throughput (especially on statics) at a far lower memory footprint. Key to success in lowering the memory footprint was dropping ThreadStackSize (from 8M default to 1M). What a difference!<p>Other than that, the competition is good for everyone. I am sure nginx pushed apache to work on mpm_event much harder.",1364181643

The kinds of low-ish pay jobs worked by degree holders aren't identical to the distribution of low-ish pay jobs worked by non-degree holders, and skew, I believe, more office/white-collar rather than manual labor. Some people implicitly attach a significant value to that, whether due to working conditions or status, enough that they're willing to take that route even if they knew up front that it's not a net-positive financial decision.

In the US context, being offended goes not give anyone rights. What gives people rights is the law. The law prohibits discrimination in the workplace based on sex, the laws says that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination based on sex, the law says that frequent and unwanted dirty jokes at the workplace can be a form of sexual harassment, and the law says that if someone doesn't like dirty jokes in the workplace then the first step is to file a complaint. And the law gives wide latitude to what the complaint can be, including making a complaint in public, and says that making a complaint gives extra protections against retaliation.<p>So no, being offended does not give people rights. Civil rights laws give people rights.<p>As to your examples, the law does not say that references to evolution, gay rights, etc. are in violation of the laws against discrimination in the workplace. However, if the only Young Earth Creationist in the company was always singled out as the person to write the ""earth geology"" transcripts, and there was no special business reason why that Y.E.C. should be singled out, then that Y.E.C may file a complaint for discrimination based on religious beliefs.<p>Because singling out someone in the workplace based on their religious belief is against the law.",1364180680

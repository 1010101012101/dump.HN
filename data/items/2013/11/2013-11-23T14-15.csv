6786082,comment,6784967,6785710,3,0,dfc,,,"&quot;Ironically&quot; is a word that you see and hear frequently in everyday english. I think its interesting how varied people&#x27;s concept of irony is for such a common word. From what I can tell most people&#x27;s definition is something between &quot;serendipity&#x27;s evil twin&quot; and &quot;partially related.&quot; It seems in this case OP thinks the definition is the latter.  I think that sooner or later &quot;ironically&quot; is going to have the same fate as &quot;randomly,&quot; (&quot;It is so random we ran into you, we were just talking about you.) which I think has zero meaning in conversational english.<p>To be honest i think most people&#x27;s definition of irony is largely shaped by Alanis Morissette&#x27;s terribly misinformed but catchy song  and  the hipster d-bag that says he has  an &quot;ironic mustache.&quot;<p>I think it is the evolution of language that is interesting?  It seems like we have a case of the more a word is used the definition becomes less concise until it carries no meaning. There has to be some linguistic jargon for this type of situation.",1385218603

Mostly shy folks, in my experience.<p>Second, pissing people off isn&#x27;t that bad of a trait -- as long as you are a friendly person and mean well. People will forgive a plethora of communication faults if you put their interests first and genuinely care about them. So what you&#x27;re really wanting to avoid is &quot;selfish assholes&quot;<p>Finally, there&#x27;s a tremendous danger in avoiding conflict in companies. Healthy conflict is a good thing, and over time we tend to want to hire people that mostly agree with us and are always on our side. This is a terrible thing to have, because it limits your creative potential.

If all the parties or just the reciepients are based in europe, between legal and illegal.. I would tap this as illegal. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense.. for someone doing a legal transfer of this size, after business hours, unless.. senders were based in US.<p>Going through the direct senders (1 step back), the time with least 1k BTC+ transactions was 0200, 0400, 0500.. while with most big transactions were made around 1300, 1500, 2100 .. suggesting that these transaction were roughly either made from US to Europe, if of legal nature.. or within europe.. suggesting something shady. Very very crudely speaking.<p>Yeah, everything is possible, and the above is not necessarily true, but it appears so, at least to me.<p>Amount: 194k bitcoins<p>Multiple connected accounts who sent to the above address seems to have had 220k+ in total recieved and looking at denomination, it didn&#x27;t seem like lot of normal people were involved. Besides, with this kind of money involved it is wise to have 10 or less people involved who are highly trusted. This appear so also, with how countable no of bitcoin addresses were used to say &quot;bounce&quot; the trace of that money. Skill wise, these are not normal people.. but given <i></i>HOW<i></i> this ended up in public domain, they could have done slightly better.<p>I get the feeling you get from govt hired people doing such things, no offense.. but somewhere below the elite, but above the average joe. It is also possible that a bigger or equal (more likely) sum was also transferred elsewhere.<p>Movement seem to have stopped.. due to attention it has already garnered or is it the actual resting place? If it would be illegal, one would have had no problem keeping it in multiple bitcoin wallets in smaller amounts. But if it is someone, with legal force on side.. say govt agency, it would not have problem leaving the bitcoins in such limelight, for a long time, as long as they believe that bitcoin is actually 100% and not 99.9999999% impregnable.<p>Motive, as discussed slightly above, can be mainly either &quot;convenience of centrality&quot; > or > &quot;hiding a bigger sum&quot; .. well I at least won&#x27;t be putting my money in BTC for my own reasons. I got that feeling today to use it.. but I resisted.<p>BTC is genuine, but the currently it seems like a pyramid fraud system which is perfectly legal strictly speaking. More people putting in money in BTC system.. already rich getting richer.. tickle down effect :? Well 150 million.. has really left a lot of questions .. or its nature, motive, ownership, moral, etc. Who would answer? No one.. ironically.. thats a big problem as well a big benefit of BTC. I&#x27;m sorry.. lot of things I said above are based on feelings, but to tell you the truth, before today, BTC was in a nutshell somewhat easy to understand.. but 150 million.. is a figure that can give any guy a lot of different vibes, speculative as well as wild goose chase type.",1385217801

Here are some pointers that may be helpful.<p>Tools: valgrind and gdb are obvious. But don&#x27;t forget your compiler! Crank up the warnings, and look through LLVM-clang&#x27;s -fsanitize=<foo> and warning options. (Also, if you&#x27;re already on OpenBSD, check out the &quot;S&quot; flag to malloc; if you&#x27;re on Solaris, check out, well, the blog post.) Finally, Boehm&#x27;s conservative garbage collector has a &quot;find memory leaks&quot; mode, which <i>looks</i> useful for those cases where you can&#x27;t get valgrind working. If all else fails, shovel through the memory dump looking for repeated patterns.<p>Testing: try to reproduce the problem; the first iteration may look something like &quot;it runs out of memory after 36 hours&quot;. Then simplify: for instance, the author of the article could have asked &quot;does this still happen if the server closes the connection immediately, without sending any data&quot; and would have found the bug very quickly. (Of course, you&#x27;re likely to ask a lot of wrong questions before hitting on the right one; experience and a full knowledge of the system you&#x27;re working on is useful but not sufficient.) Questions like &quot;does this happen more quickly if we ping 100 times per second instead of once every ten minutes&quot; are often useful as well. (Finally, just printing memory usage every N seconds is helpul.)<p>Coding: be careful when writing code. The usual ways of improving code quality (e.g. code reviews) work to reduce memory leaks, too. Try to run a multiple-hour soak test every so often during development (preferably on a CI server); it&#x27;s a lot easier to debug &quot;hey, we suddenly run out of memory after yesterday&#x27;s commits&quot; than &quot;well, something goes wrong in production&quot;. If you&#x27;re doing new development, consider alternatives to malloc() - arena/pool allocation (e.g. libtalloc) is convenient and very fast if your memory use is tree-like (e.g. a connections owns a request owns some memory to sort the data before returning it). In C, goto a single chunk of cleanup-and-return code rather than duplicating the cleanup at every place where you exit from the function.",1385217393

Here is how China could break it if they wanted to:<p>1. Choose domains that you want to monitor in this way. E.g. github.com.<p>2. Requests to any IP for that domain on port 443 will return a certificate that the Chinese government issued using CNNIC. This is trusted by at least Mozilla: <a href=\"http://snag.gy/E1ftE.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://snag.gy/E1ftE.jpg</a> (note to self: delete that ca)<p>3. Requests to any IP for that domain on port 80 will be converted to ssl. So the browser is connected over http to the ISP, and the ISP&#x27;s servers will connect over https/ssl to Github.<p>In all instances, monitoring is possible. Forcing ssl is no solution.

Then you need to know a wide range of tools the given OS offers for examining things, so that you do not get hopelessly stuck in the face of an emergency, since you often have to investigate a crash while it happens to even be able to reproduce it, so you need to know how to examine a running process etc. For Linux this means knowing stuff like:<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace</a><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lsof\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lsof</a><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vmstat\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vmstat</a><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstat\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstat</a><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace</a><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump</a><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key</a><p><a href=\"https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page</a><p>...<p>There is a big bunch of tools in the OS very few developers know, sysadmins know more, but they often don&#x27;t understand the OS and use the tools without understanding their output too well.<p>Some confirmation of what I have written here is the fact that Joyent forked OpenSolaris to create an OS precisely to make it easier to do things of this kind:<p><a href=\"http://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/Why+SmartOS+-+ZFS%2C+KVM%2C+DTrace%2C+Zones+and+More#WhySmartOS-ZFS%2CKVM%2CDTrace%2CZonesandMore-ALittleHistory\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/Why+SmartOS+-+ZFS%2C+KVM...</a><p><i>In 2005, Sun Microsystems open sourced Solaris, its renowned Unix operating system, eventually to be released as a distribution called OpenSolaris.

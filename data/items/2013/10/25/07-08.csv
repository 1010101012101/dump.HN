Is the same being done to US politicians?<p>The most useful applications of this I can think of are betraying allies, manipulating negotiations with rival trade blocs, economic espionage, and of course protecting the power of the agencies who perform this surveillance and the lucky few who are given strictly limited access to it.<p>If the POTUS is given this intelligence and makes most of his decisions based on it, how does he know that he is being given the truth, rather than a carefully edited version of it?<p>It seems surveillance is no longer focussed on terrorism, if it ever was (indeed a few terrorist attacks have gone on the US without detection in spite of all this surveillance). It&#x27;s telling that even the NSA have given up using that excuse as it becomes more and more clear where the focus of their intelligence gathering is directed.<p>Is the NSA (and the US by proxy) using the information it collects as a way of protecting and expanding its power? Is this inevitable if you give an organisation that much power over our lives and very little oversight?<p>Are all allies of the US mistrusted so much that they must be spied on? Should they in return shut down trust of the US and repudiate treaties they have with it like the one sharing SWIFT data or details of people visiting the US? Can the EU trust the products of American internet companies, or should they set up rivals?<p>It seems information has become more and more synonymous with power as our economies in the west become information economies, and the greatest power of all has been handed to an agency without significant legal limits and without any sort of public accountability, led by a member of the military.",1382687999

I would be expecting it to return elements 3 & 5 (shortcut to <i>a[3]</i> & <i>a[5]</i>) instead of doing a length slice.<p>For eg, in perl:<p><pre><code>  my @a = qw/zero one two three four five six/;\n\n  $a[3];        # &quot;three&quot;   \n  @a[3, 5];     # (&quot;three&quot;, &quot;five&quot;)\n  @a[3, 0, 5];  # (&quot;three&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;five&quot;)\n  @a[1..5];     # (&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot;, &quot;five&quot;)\n  </code></pre>\nAlso the ... operator is slightly at odds when compared against .. operator.  I think perl6 has a more intuitive version:<p><pre><code>  @a[1..^5];  #  [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot;]\n</code></pre>\nSo instead of 1 to 5 (1..5) you think 1 upto 5 (1..^5).",1382687852

As a secondary fraud-prevention measure, merchants may ask you to sign a receipt that may or may not match the one on the back of your card.<p>To be fair, there are a number of fraud detection algorithms at play as well, but those algorithms often have wholes in them or come into play only after the fraud has occurred.<p>As an online service, Dwolla requires users to authenticate directly with them, where they can take steps to mitigate fraud by requiring two-factor authentication, etc. Authentication with merchants is handled via a token-based method. In addition, fraud detection may also be substantially easier because Dwolla is privacy to additional information about its users (IP address, purchase details, cookie tracking, etc.) that may not be available to traditional credit card providers. Dwolla may also be privy to additional information that allows them to assess the credit-worthiness of their customers and minimize the danger of default.<p>This probably doesn&#x27;t totally explain how Dwolla dropped the cost of fraud detection down to a flat 25 cents (e.g. it doesn&#x27;t explain why PayPal charges a percentage-based fee), but I bet it&#x27;s part of the story.",1382685625

I will guess you are aiming at PMs, in mid sized + large  companies (Not aiming at getting an install for every PM in the whole company, just one for whom you solve his / her pain)<p>3. This suggests you need to integrate easily into the workflow of a PM : which means ActiveSirectory as a identity provider, and probably Atlassian for grabbing tasks.  YMMV<p>4. you cannot run as a SaaS for this market - you need to be installable inside their firewall.\nthe people I am talking about will not touch externally hosted services with a barge pole.<p>5. So keep the project open source, keep the SaaS as a free trial based in number of seats (effectively offering a free for ever service to small companies willing to externally host, funded by sales to larger companies wanting internal hosting)<p>6. the actual saleable product : yearly maintenance and install support (charge by the year, that way people can raise a purchase request and just let you chase the invoice - at a certain level say 500/mth upwards - it is worth paying a VA to be the chaser- do not write payments code at all for this ever. only write such code when revenue is enough to pay someone else to write it.  repeat it is not your job to collect money or to write code to do the collect / account shutdown etc.<p>Sell maintenance: three - six months release cycle - that is code goes onto SaaS and into proprietary installer now then onto GitHub in six months.  so there is value in the maintenance license<p>Do not sell yourself for anything other than installation support - you want to be talking to the sysadmin about integrating AD not to the PM about how to reset a password<p>If you do sell &quot;reset a password&quot; support the  do it expensively enough that the first sale is enough to hire a VA or similar to be your front line support.  do not do support yourself.<p>So - sensible suggestions now:<p>*  Take yearly payments via Invoice, this way it&#x27;s worth your time manually handling the chase up.  Don&#x27;t bother monthly because it is sooooo much simpler to sign up to a free trial by sending a purchase request than actual money<p>*  Don&#x27;t do time limited trials, but do it by number of seats etc.  And do not at all write the code to monitor and shutdown accounts automatically till the SQL query and email cut paste takes you an hour a day alone<p>*  Marketing via guest blogs: there are many project mgmt magazines and blogs.  spend Saturday googling and then email a bog standard &quot;please can I write a guest blog&quot; to half of them Saturday evening.  you can always do the tailored mails later but you need something to keep you motivated<p>* Get down to one benefit and sell that for a while.  I think the &quot;integrates into your other stuff to give one view&quot; is nice but whatever.  Just have a benefit and sell that for 3-6 months, only then let the words lean or pivot into your brain<p>* email newsletter obviously<p>* Keep it open source - as above <i>trust</i> is important here - if I cannot trust encryption to keep my stuff safe I need to trust you have written good code - OSS helps there<p>- so people can host it themselves - it&#x27;s free, but installer and reporting packages that are licensed bolt ons, with escrow based source code release (stackechange has something like this)<p>edit: sorry that got a bit long and noprocrast delayed me long enough I have to do real work now so it&#x27;s a bit of a stream of consciousness",1382684783

CEO&#x27;s and managers don&#x27;t accept internal criticism or suggestions, don&#x27;t give their people the freedom to take action themselves, but some outsider swoops in with an impressive Powerpoint presentation (or dress) and suddenly they see the light.<p>It&#x27;s the opposite of taking risks (you can blame the outsiders if it fails), it&#x27;s actually cowardice.",1382684729

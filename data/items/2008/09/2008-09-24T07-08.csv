313291,comment,313025,313067,0,0,ragnemalm,,,"Many are a fan of using the Caps Lock key as Control.  While better than the insane standard positioning, it's still not optimal: it's not symmetrical between your hands (you're not going to remap Return as another Control) and it still makes for a lot of awkward pinky use.  (Imagine playing a piano piece all with your 3rd, 4th and 5th fingers.)<p>The optimal solution I've come up with is to use the two keys adjacent to the space bar (typically Alt, but actually Command on the Apple keyboard I generally use) as Control, since that's easily the most important modifier key, so it should be the easiest to access.  This makes C-w, C-s, C-r, C-a, C-e, C-p, C-o, C-j, C-l and so on very, very comfortable compared to the corner positioning.  As far as I know, this is the way many keyboards were before the extended IBM PC keyboard came up with its insane control key positioning.  (My comfort with these keys may also be linked to my use of Macs and ubiquitous command-key shortcuts before I switched to Ubuntu.  Ironically, Emacs is much more comfortable now in Ubuntu than it ever was on my Mac, because I can use the most readily accessible modifier key as God intended, rather than the third-tier relegated modifier that Control is on the Mac.)<p>The two keys adjacent to the new Control keys (ie. 2 away from the spacebar) then become the Alt keys.  Whatever is left over (the original ctrl keys, plus Caps Lock and any silly Windows keys left over) can be bound to Super, which is useful for window manager shortcuts so that they don't clobber emacs/bash/screen bindings.<p>These changes are trivially easy to put in a simple .Xmodmap file to load whenever you log in, and copy to all the other computers you have to use regularly.  If you're using Windows, I guess you may have to fiddle with the registry, but it would be worth it.",1222243133
313290,comment,312122,312986,0,0,Tichy,,,"To be fair, I don't think I went through as elaborate mathematical considerations as the writer of the article. But even he mentions that he immediately had a bad feeling about the wrong solution, simply because it is doing too much work.<p>The step for me was to move away from the stochastic problem and say ""wait a minute, there is a random generator built into my computer already, how can I use it directly"". Assuming a horde of mathematicians has already showed that the inbuilt random numbers generator is as good as possible, that way I avoid all the maths issues. And that is a step that seems reasonable to expect from a good programmer.<p>Edit: just read the Knuth Shuffle entry at wikipedia. Happy that I even reinvented the Knuth optimization myself ;-)",1222243055
313289,comment,312429,312429,0,0,skmurphy,,,"We are doing some of those, not to as large an audience as 37signals. One thing that makes it difficult is a lack of good tools to re-purpose content across blogs, wiki, web, print, presentations, animation/video, and PDF. We do workshops where we have the content both as a presentation (slides), a workbook/handout, and in a wiki. It's a lot of extra work right now. Conceptually we develop/refine in a wiki and deliver as presentation (PPT slides), print, and wiki (slimmed down, that is then available as an on-line notebook where further work can be done). I have contact info in my profile and would welcome any suggestions for tools that make it easy to develop and re-purpose content.",1222243018
313288,comment,313200,313253,0,0,thamer,,,"I agree with the article and probably with you too on the large number of low-quality applications, but there is no obvious solution to the problem of decreasing quality coming with an increasingly large population (of developers, of HN users, of Usenet posters...)<p>In your opinion, what would common sense be in that case? Apple got criticized for censoring applications; True, that was because these applications were competing with Apple's own services, but the move still sent a strong message. 
Apple will probably want to retain a large control over what can go on an iPhone (hint: Flash wouldn't), and an arbitrary decision on what is acceptable or not in terms of quality can be a very bad thing. IMHO, the review process is probably the best hope in this case, the first few people buying an application rating it to warn (or invite) other customers.",1222242944

313285,comment,312807,312807,0,0,cturner,,,"Have you noticed that one of the main results of this saving of things which are ""too big too fail"" is a concentration of those big businesses into even bigger business, a greater proportion of which are now too big to fail? The rhetoric we had become used to hearing - that liquidity is subtle but very important (which it is) has changed to language of protection and we see policy responses to this. For example - the bans on non-naked shorting hits the liquidity of the options market (because it's harder to do things like hedging when you want to deal in options) and leads to further stagnation.",1222242578

There is no good way to play sound in a browser except via flash.<p>So I used a hidden flash applet and triggered it via html events. But the flash itself was hidden since it didn't have a UI - it was just for playing sound.<p>Since it was hidden there was no way to click-active it for flash block people.<p>Maybe I could have put a message of some kind saying flash wasn't active, but it didn't seem worth the trouble.

313274,comment,313025,313025,0,0,pdrummond,,,"I am a die hard vim user who has been learning Clojure recently and I have learned a little Emacs along the way because everyone in the Lisp community bangs on about it.<p>The funny thing is, every time I go to write some Clojure code - I want to open a Vim session, but I am always strangely drawn to Emacs for some reason.<p>Recently, I decided to figure out what it was about Emacs that made me want to use it so much over Vim.  I soon realised it was all about being able to load a REPL process in a window and interact with it on the fly.<p>I can run Emacs, open a Clojure source file, write a function then hit C-M-x to send the function to the REPL to be evaluated.  Also relevant is that Clojure support in Emacs was available shortly after Clojure's release to the public late in 200.<p>This is a very specific case (lisp-style interactive development) but it's why I personally think Emacs is great and for me it has nothing to do with Emacs text editing features! I will always prefer Vim for pure text editing power.",1222241785

1742225,comment,1742042,1742042,0,0,BrandonM,,,"> Think and learn<p>I think the utility of doing this is often understated. Many of us have been led to believe that if we are ""just sitting there"" without reading or talking or whatever else, then we are wasting time. I felt this way for a long time, but at the same time I was too lazy to make the trip to the library or carry my heavy laptop onto the bus.<p>After some time spending my bus rides simply relaxing and thinking, I found myself considering ideas that I really hadn't before. I would suggest to anyone who's interested to try it for a couple weeks and see if it does some good. I suggest taking a notebook to occasionally jot down the ideas you have, but remember that the point is not to write but to let your mind wander and contemplate various topics.",1285819193

Now they are in a tough spot because the world has moved on and they are fast losing end-user value because they don't have any foot holds in new markets.<p>Personally - I got a Yahoo! Mail account in 1997 and it was my primary ""personal"" mail account (as in, what I use with friends and family) until last year.    Then I got an Android phone, and it blew Yahoo out of my life because the integration of Google services is simply unparalleled on there.

The subject is not me.  It ain't about me.  It's not about Hilbert space or measure theory.  I'm not suggesting that others should be like me.<p>My comments are about the book and how well it can help students in computer science.<p>I would encourage students to look for higher quality.<p>Yes, the book touches on several topics each of which could be a semester or two.  So, yes, few undergraduate students in computer science could take all those semesters, especially before getting on with the applications in computing.  In particular, they can't wait for some junior level course in abstract algebra.  Putting the topics in the book into one course should be okay.<p>Still, for what the students do study, even as freshmen, the quality should be higher.<p>I will guess:  The course was 'coordinated' with some later courses and, thus, has some topics some later courses want as prerequisites.  So the main purpose of the course of the book was to provide the prerequisites.  So, maybe in some one department's coordinated courses the book has a useful role to play.  But this utility of the book does not much apply to independent study.<p>Still, coordinated courses or not, low quality is not good.<p>I don't object to the list of topics if only because all of them are important.  I would object to the quality.<p>Generally to use math for anything very significant, need to have higher quality in the presentation, content, and learning.  With an analogy, if a course in residential electricity were taught with such low quality, someone trying to wire a house would likely get shocked and maybe electrocuted.<p>More generally I would make two points:<p>First, there is a lot of math that with current computing is becoming more important.  So, for whatever reasons, engineering and computer science departments are trying to teach this math.  Such things have been tried before, in sociology, psychology, economics, physics, chemistry, and more.  E.g., some chemists came to the undergrad math department I was in for help with a few pages in a chemistry book.  The pages were on group representation theory which, back to E. Wigner, it turns out are key to molecular spectroscopy and, thus, identification of chemical compounds.  Nonsense; total, useless nonsense:  There's NO WAY to say anything significant about group representation theory in just a few pages in a chemistry book.  So some chemist was trying to teach some math to chemists.  Bummer.  My undergraduate math honors paper, then, became on group representation theory.<p>The pattern continues:  Academic departments that need some math too often try to teach the math themselves and, then, as for that chemist, make a mess out of it.  The main problem is, the quality is too low.  Or, some modern cooks need to know some chemistry, but there is no way someone can learn chemistry from such a cook that is not also, independently, a good chemist.<p>In particular, computer science is slowly grabbing off significant chunks of pure and applied math -- number theory for cryptography; integer linear programming for computer job scheduling, communications network design, and many cases of resource allocation and also for addressing P versus NP; finite field theory for error correcting codes; statistical hypothesis testing for monitoring health and wellness of software, servers, and networks; some points about relations for relational data base; neural networks, a general purpose data fitting technique, for 'artificial intelligence'; statistical model building for 'machine learning'; some points from combinatorics and probability for analysis of the computational time complexity of algorithms, etc. -- and this direction is bad for both computer science and the students because the resulting quality is too low.<p>Yes, for some decades now the math departments have been in the catbird seat over nearly all of physical science, social science, engineering, technology, medical science, statistics, stochastic processes, optimization, and finance, and have some high potential in information technology entrepreneurship, but consistently blew the opportunity and pushed these applications and their fields and many, new, interesting, valuable, associated math research questions out of the math departments.  Sorry 'bout that.  But, the fact remains:  Math with good quality is still essentially ONLY in the math departments.<p>Yes, the math departments are due a LOT of blame:  They should offer more in service courses for these many other fields AND also take in problems in these other fields as math research problems.<p>Math had an opportunity to grab most of the importance of all those other fields and grow to become by far the most important academic department of all and, instead, pushed out contact with those other fields and shrank.  Still the good stuff, both in math and its applications to other fields, is in math departments.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>Second, if students in computer science are to make progress in computing by applying math, then I believe that they need to learn the math with much higher quality than in the book.  Indeed my view is that the main future of computer science is just math, and that math promises to be more important for the future of computing than Moore's law.  But for this future, quality is needed.<p>Instead of the quality, the course looks like a catch all so that students can have some prerequisites to listen to lectures in future courses in computer science, lectures that report some old work where some math was used; so the students get to hold on by their fingernails and listen to these reports of past glories.<p>These past glories, e.g., analyzing the performance of heap sort, a minimum spanning tree algorithm, or Kerberos, is old work now buried in software just to be used.  The challenge is what will be new, the future, and to attack that with math my view is that more quality is needed.<p>Or, I've applied math to problems in computer science and practical computing, but there was no way I could have made the applications having learned the math with only the level of quality in the book.  Net, that material is not 'professional strength'; that boat is not strong enough to get you across the river.<p>I thought that these points were clear enough in my original post.",1285817786

1742163,comment,1740289,1740859,0,0,recoil,,,"I don't think there is another language out there that could have given Minecraft the kind of success that it's had (The same applies to Runescape). Many Windows users have a JVM + the Java plugin installed already, and the only other widely-known plugin that gives the kind of 3D performance that you can extract out of Java is Unity3D. While Unity is easy enough to install, it's been around for a lot less long and it's less widely known and developed for. Most users would have experienced a jarring ""please install this plugin"" moment before they got to play, and I'm pretty sure that the immediacy with which players have been able to get into Minecraft has been a big part of its success.<p>Contrary to what you repeatedly hear about Java, it actually has very decent performance.  Sure, the ME edition is horrible (if that was somebody's only exposure to Java game programming I'd forgive them for never wanting to touch the language again), and some years ago applet performance was awful (which seems to have left a bad taste in the mouths of a significant number of hackers), but these days if you avoid Swing (and why would you want such a toolkit for a 3D game like Minecraft anyway?) and use a library like LWJGL then you can produce a game with decent performance and graphics.  Minecraft is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to scaling down to older machines, but it still runs reasonably well on quite a lot of older hardware (up to about 5 yrs old, or thereabouts).  That leaves you with a very large potential userbase.<p>Also contrary to what you might hear, Java's actually not <i>that</i> shabby of a language either.  Sure, you sacrifice some of the features and syntactic sugar found in higher-level languages like Python & Ruby (in return for performance), but garbage collection and higher-level features like reflection that are not found in C/C++ mean that development speed is still pretty good.  There are a wide variety of available libraries to help you out too.<p>Lastly, much of Java's reputation for verbosity doesn't apply to games development.  You don't have to use any of the libraries that require XML-heavy configuration like Spring or Hibernate, nor any of horrifyingly verbose stuff like EJBs or JDBC (actually there's nothing forcing you to use those for enterprise stuff either).  Once you've taken care of the performance-intensive graphics stuff, you're ""only"" left with the core game logic.

Is it better to keep an unhappy marriage together or to create two new happier marriages?<p><i>3. Community life: country has either high rate of church attendance or trade-union membership.</i> Seriously? Apparently freelancing atheists are miserable.<p><i>6. Climate and geography: Latitude, to distinguish between warmer and colder climates.</i> It's ridiculous to claim that latitude is a prime determiner of quality-of-life. Some people prefer tropical beaches, but others love changing seasons and still others like ice fishing. As far as climate and geography are concerned, would you rather live in a Saharan desert or Crete? Places with similar latitudes can have vastly different climates, anyways.<p><i>7. Job security: Unemployment rate.</i> Fair enough, but low unemployment rate isn't necessarily an indicator of job security: there could still be high churn. Also, a nation that provides a sufficient level of services means that the unemployed are never too badly off, while a country that provides none could see its few unemployed living in misery. Serious question: would a country with single-worker households have an unemployment rate near 50%?<p><i>9. Gender equality: Measured using ratio of average male and female earnings.</i> Terrible. Does this even factor in number of hours worked? It certainly doesn't account for differences in the work being performed or for cultural differences.<p>By my count, about half of those metrics are crap. Creating an index from that is basically hokum. Anyone could tweak the metrics to almost arbitrarily reorder the rankings.",1285816835

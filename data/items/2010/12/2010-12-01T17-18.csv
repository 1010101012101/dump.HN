1958756,comment,1955263,1956656,0,0,tibbon,,,"Hmm, really? This position basically describes me, and I've been debating lately how I can best pitch myself to a company as I continue to move through my career. Although like you mentioned, I'd most like to be a co-founder with a company when I make my next move.<p>I can get around in Rails but I'm strongest with just pure Ruby at the moment (and a bit of C, Java, PHP, etc). I understand social networks and I've done quite a bit of published research on that front. I understand customer needs and how to reach them. Analytics, datamining and split testing are fun. I like beautiful code, user accessibility, and feel that good SEO is a natural result from good coding practices and practical sense. I know how to structure advertising campaigns and what works and what doesn't. I understand how to shape a product and make decisions for building a strong infrastructure. The key is having a good product with a clear message. User data privacy is important to me. I look good in a suit, and VCs seem to like me. I can learn anything needed, and I'll love doing it. I don't mind working long hard hours and enjoy being challenged to the degree that I get bored easily if not challenged. I'm good with people and can lead a team effectively. I've got experience from working with a handful of companies now. I'm young and have few prior commitments, enabling frequent traveling when needed. I thrive off networking and knowing everyone in the room. I like taking risk. I have solid references.<p>About the only thing holding me back a little bit is that I've recently moved to Columbus, Ohio and I'm committed to being here for the next few years while my girlfriend finishes her PhD. At the same time, I've worked remotely for several companies and it rarely poses an issue.<p>Yet, I see many startups looking for a CTO or lead programmer who is the kung fu master of the code. I can understand any code you show me, but I'm more of a hybrid of marketing, business and development than just a pure developer.",1291226397
1958755,comment,1957645,1957720,0,0,andreyf,,,"<i>I think it's pretty different. - It doesn't have a public application process.</i><p>Why is this a good thing?<p><i>It doesn't give you $15-20k for 6%, but instead matches your annual salary with caps at 90k, 140k and 190 if you are a 1, 2 or 3 person team respectively.</i><p>In NYC, I'd expect three competent software engineers to be making ~400k. That's a 50% salary cut (it's livable, but certainly leaves room for competition). In other parts of the world, this would obviously be different... maybe you should adjust it for cost of living?<p><i>HackFwd always gets 27% equity, and you are required to give away 3% to advisors/referrers.</i><p>So your valuation of an idea ranges from ~$330k to ~$700k, based only on the number of founders? If the % equity is constant, doesn't that encourage an applicant to always come up with three founders, even if one of them ends up dropping out and not taking any equity?",1291226341

With basic stuff like IP address, time zone, screen size, user agent, and supported plugins, you're pretty much there.<p>The web server asking the browser ""do you support X?"" increases latency and doesn't help anonymity. Bad web servers could just ask, ""Do you support X, Y, Z, and what's your screen size..."" If each of these questions prompts the user, it's a usability nightmare. If the browser's answers are configurable, why not make current browser information configurable instead of inventing a new standard?",1291226257

1958724,comment,1957645,1957645,0,0,Prezzer,,,"Hi all, I'm the founder of the first UK company to be invited onto HackFWD and speaking for myself and my two co-founders I can safely say we're absolutely delighted to be on board. Since our first contact with David, the ""Talent Geek""  we've been treated absolutely fantastically and have been humbled by the level of support received. The join process was very straight forward, fast and informal, which allowed us to remain entirely focussed on developing our product without the worry of jumping through hoops X Factor style.<p>Reading the comments here and previous comments from other articles, it seems that most people consider 27% equity to be too large a chunk to give away. Of course everyone will have different opinions on this, but our reaction was positive. We felt that the larger equity stake would encourage the investor to really support our growth, rather than looking for a quick flip in a few months time. We're working hard to build a really awesome product here with long term goals and so the opportunity to have 12 months of support from some of the most respected tech people this side of the Atlantic was a no brainer.<p>Had we not taken the investment and continued to bootstrap, our project may never have gotten off the ground - juggling client work which always took priority made it almost impossible to get any focus. Our logic implied that 73% of a multi million pound company supported by hugely experienced technology and business strategists was a whole lot better than 100% of a half baked idea and ongoing client hassle. Now, we're entirely focussed on building something awesome and that feels great every day.<p>To be honest, I think that the people who come on here talking about the money, aren't really true entrepreneurs anyway. I know I'm one, and I know for sure that money is way down on my priority list. We just want to build something awesome and HackFWD is giving us a wonderful opportunity to do that.<p>In my opinion, anyone with a great startup idea and a passion to match should definitely start hunting down HackFWD referrers and I say that with absolute sincerity.",1291225715

1958709,comment,1957645,1958621,0,0,danielsiders,,,"My primary objection is that they seem to be focused on acquisition of nascent talent and ideas in an attempt to corner the market on potential startup developers without a clear plan about what to do with them. The amount of money and perks going out to everyone involved both lessens the pressure to succeed and suggests a focus on acquisition instead of development. Of course everyone's there to make money and successful ventures support others but it seems like advisors are filling the roles of VC partners without appropriate remuneration and founders are being treated like employees. I don't like the value relationships all around, it doesn't seem like they help build successful companies, just cherry pick ideas and products in exchange for a salary. That doesn't seem good for the European tech economy or those who would otherwise become real founders on their own. It seems like they're trying to do an even earlier stage acquisition than companies like google have moved into, but without offering the future google does. Again, it might work there, but it's not something I'd want to be a part of or what I'd like to see long term in Europe. If it's a stopgap measure to keep talent there and in a few years a stronger community exists to help startups develop, then that's great.",1291225411

1958650,comment,1957997,1957997,0,0,grellas,,,"Failure does not power Silicon Valley. Failure is only a byproduct of a rich entrepreneurial culture whose overriding goal is success. That culture understands that startups inevitably will have a non-trivial failure rate and factors this into such things as equity structures, company valuations, decisions to fund or not to fund particular ventures, decisions to leave secure employment situations in favor of joining startups and the like. But failure is never the goal. It is only a byproduct. To me, therefore, it is not accurate to say that failure ""powers"" Silicon Valley.<p>Apart from some overstatement about the concept of failure (e.g., its being regarded as a ""badge of honor"" in the Valley), this piece makes some good observations about how the Valley has grown and prospered through continued flexibility and experimentation in contrast to the relative rigidity that has hampered Japan's startups.<p>Silicon Valley is beautifully set up to encourage <i>risk taking</i> but the goal of all risk takers is success, not failure. The United States, like Japan, once had a mindset by which the goal of every responsible working adult was to have a ""steady job"" and there have been cultural factors aplenty that have discouraged people from leaving such jobs to take a whirl with a startup. The move from that mindset to that of the risk-taking entrepreneur is driven by the hope of an extraordinary return for one's efforts. In Silicon Valley, it has been proven over and over again that such extraordinary returns are possible for those who are smart and enterprising and that historically has been the main draw for joining a startup. Today, with the low barriers to entry, the reasons for taking the leap into startups can be more complex (personal growth, etc. can now factor in). But the overriding goal is still money. Silicon Valley provides a fertile ground for those who are driven by that desire and provides all that is needed for success with a startup (as do other centers of startup activity).<p>What drives the Valley, then, is not failure as such but rather the large number of smart, disciplined, talented people who want to do something special in hopes of getting large rewards. Those people are not afraid to fail but their very essence is to try to avoid it at all costs while chasing after the prize of success.",1291224723

  </c:when>
  <c:when test=""${!empty comments}"">

Each of the choose/when tags has a newline after it, so even though the tag is not output into the resulting HTML source, it causes a literal newline to be emitted. This doesn't normally matter, since HTML collapses multiple runs of whitespace into a single space.<p>However, for places where you can't have any whitespace (like the middle of a word) you can work around that by concatenating all the tags into one long line, or by strange arrangements of opening/closing angle brackets:<p><pre><code>  <c:choose
  ><c:when test=""...""

1958599,comment,1955761,1955761,0,0,zachallaun,,,"Another comment mentioned Steve Blank's <i>The Four Steps to the Epiphany</i>. I will elaborate a bit on why the ideas in this book may be relevant to your situation.<p>Steve Blank argues (and many more agree) that a startup is a temporary organization designed to accomplish a small set of goals:<p><pre><code>  1) Learn and understand exactly who your customers are
  2) Learn and understand exactly what your customers will pay for
  3) Achieve product/market fit (though Blank does not use this term specifically)
</code></pre>
Only after you've met this criteria to you begin marketing. What you have described is reminiscent of the ""build it and they will come,"" where the focus was on building your product instead of understanding your customers. I may be mischaracterizing your situation, but history has taught this method to be fatal for a startup.<p>To better understand this, it's best to fall back onto Paul Buchheit's notion that a small base of customers who <i>love</i> you is always better than a large base of customers who <i>like</i> you. The reasoning behind this is thus: A small, passionate base of visionary customers can be exuberant about a Minimal Viable Product, whereas the mainstream market cannot. From those visionary customers willing to purchase an MVP as opposed to a whole product, you can learn <i>an incredible amount</i>.<p>Back to you: Currently, you have a small number of customers who <i>like</i> you. If the base of visionary early customers you've attracted just like you, how can you expect the mainstream market (which you seem to be aiming for) to even like you that much? The important factor here is that the mainstream market has even <i>more</i> needs than the customers you're currently serving.<p>You're worried about cash, and I'm afraid that marketing may be money down the drain. I recommend analyzing your spending and drastically lowering your burn rate. Turn away from the mainstream market and back to your visionary customers. Ask them questions. Find out how you can build a product that they <i>love</i>. Achieve product/market fit (for more information on that, I recommend searching out Sean Ellis' blog).<p>It seems that there is much to learn about your customers, and that the best course of action here may be moving backward instead of moving forward.",1291223980

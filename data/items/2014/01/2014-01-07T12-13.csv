Threads are in no sense &#x27;broken&#x27; - compared to CSP or actors, they just give you a larger set of things you can write. Some of those things are bugs. Others are very useful. For example, a disruptor:<p><a href""http://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor"" rel""nofollo"">http://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/</a><p>Nulls are broken because they let you write bugs, but don&#x27;t let you write anything you couldn&#x27;t write with options or whatever.",1389099556

7017003,comment,7016436,7016826,10,0,Retric,,,"While some people may find a &#x27;basic&#x27; income sufficient many of them are already on government benefits anyway.  The real issue with the current system is the effective marginal income tax causes people pay effective tax rates in the 80-120+% range stranding them in poverty.  With basic income that does not happen you always keep most of what you earn so working more hours always useful.<p>EX: Someone on unemployment can get 340$ a week for 6 months and goes away if you have a job.  Minimum wage is less than 8.50$ an hour so you could make less money working a 40 hour week than taking unemployment.  Social Security has similar issues where someone on disability can&#x27;t take a greater job a Walmart for extra income without losing far more money.",1389099524

I explicitly mentioned prosecuting both of them, but brought up the blind spots that contain the larger problems. Paying a lot more attention to the much smaller problem is not logical.<p>> Anyway global regulators are doing all they can to clean up the banks and have them pay restitution for their actions.

It sounds like hashbrownchew (vpsexperience.wordpress.com) wrote this article with the intent of stirring up as much controversy as possible. However, when I read through it I was perplexed. Reading the article[1] that DO asked him to edit did not give me much sympathy for hashbrownchew either. He refers to Collins as &quot;one obnoxious Googler&quot; and then somewhat-creepily investigates (with instructions) where Collins is lives to use for another inflammatory point. This entire article sounds much like a hashbrownchew is a papparazzi trying to provoke a reaction from Collins and then trying to further stir up controversy after misrepresenting Collins gets him into trouble. I really do not see why he didn&#x27;t just edit the article to be anonymous.

This was my entire strategy, which the professor advised for rejecting non-English (it turns out recognizing non-English is easier than recognizing English), and works well:<p>1. Parse the full text of some long book available on Project Gutenberg.  Record every trigram that occurs.  Frequency is irrelevant; we just want to know whether a trigram occurs or not.<p>2. Go through your text, counting the number of trigrams that didn&#x27;t exist in the sample text.  If the number of strange trigrams exceeds a threshold (for my project I used a threshold of 3, but you can tune this), reject the text as non-English.<p>Given the constant finite threshold I used, that does amount to a regex, but I don&#x27;t recommend trying to write it out explicitly.",1389099077

He was really pursuing his lifelong obsession with communism, which was another political movement that probably would have died without so much government surveillance. His spying didn&#x27;t do anything to dissuade Martin Luther King or other members of the Civil Rights movement. All that effort and violation of privacy for a difficult to discern impact on history.<p>Stealing and publishing documents from the FBI didn&#x27;t seem to have much of an impact either. There was a temporary public outcry, some commissions were established and the whole thing was forgotten in less than a decade. We just wound up in the same situation 40 years later and will most likely end up with the same results. It takes a mountain of courage to steal from the freaking FBI, and that group of people deserve credit for standing up for what they believed in. If only their risk produced a more appreciable reward for society.<p>I fear a never ending cycle of surveillance and protest. Chicken and the egg. The stakes seem higher now, on both sides, but there are no guarantees that we won&#x27;t go through the whole process again to achieve the same non-result.

7016868,comment,7015139,7015139,29,0,netcan,,,"There&#x27;s some sort of point about experts in general which I am not sure exactly how to articulate but I think is relevant. I&#x27;m going to try to klutz through it anyway.<p>There are lots of fields where fundamental theories are relatively weak or have poor predictive powers. Macroeconomics, climatology, nutrition etc. Basically, we don&#x27;t have real Knowledge. We have a bunch of data and a bunch of theories. Some of the theories that aren&#x27;t very general or aren&#x27;t very applicable to real life scenarios <i>are</i> predictive but relatively useless. We know that certain nutrients have some importance. We know that restricting caloric intake leads to weight loss. We know that money supply, inflation and other things are linked together in various ways. The theories don&#x27;t answer the questions we want then to with any kind of certainty. Still, we sometimes need to make decisions and some knowledge is better than none so we go and find experts anyway. There <i>are</i> people who are experts. They&#x27;re experts in the study and they are aware of our knowledge in the field such as it is. But they don&#x27;t have real answers because there just aren&#x27;t useful answers to be had at this point. All of medicine was like this until pretty recently.<p>When Darwin published &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; evolutionary biology came to being as a different kind of field. One where the knowledge was real and the theory predictive. The theory was fundamental and strong. Darwin could make claims & predictions with a lot of confidence. Subsequent biologists could keep making predictions and when new discoveries (like genetics) were made, they were found to be consistent with the predictions of evolutionary biology. In fact, if they hadn&#x27;t been, a careful researcher would probably assume that the mistake was in their own conclusions, not in Darwins. So if Chimpanzees are closer to humans than to Gorillas, we share common acceptors not shared with Gorillas and the distinction between Humans and Apes (if we want to keep Apes as a category) is morphological (which is allowed by Darwin) rather than one of proximity on a family tree.<p>Darwin was careful. He didn&#x27;t publish until he was sure. If he didn&#x27;t been sure we wouldn&#x27;t have published. There are lots of Darwins in every one of the former type of field. They haven&#x27;t discovered real Knowledge that can tell them what to do in an economic recession or what people should eat so they shut their mouth and keep looking. They are still experts but their expert opinion is &quot;I dunno.&quot; That doesn&#x27;t register as expertise so we go on to find someone that will explain about Aggregate demand, antinflamatory diets, carbohydrates or something like that.<p>Development methodologies, executive compensation, distributed companies etc. are in the category of things that we don&#x27;t have real &quot;scientific&quot; knowledge about. Most business-ey knowledge is like that.<p>Now it sounds like I&#x27;m bashing people who talk about this stuff and I don&#x27;t mean to be (hence my disclaimer at the start). I&#x27;m just pointing out that our knowledge in different fields is different. Joel Spolsky is very insightful in his essays about the Software industry, for example.  But there are certain people that are comfortable with anecdote and generalities and assertions that may turn out to be untrue. There are certain people (like Darwin) who are not. If we&#x27;re talking about development methodologies, the people we here from are self selected. They are comfortable making grand statements, manifestos and such even though they may be wrong.<p>That&#x27;s still useful and certainly interesting, but there is a big category of people we aren&#x27;t hearing from and they are relevant to the discussion.",1389097128

Move one card in Trello and you can both communicate to your team the status of a task and track your time. No timers. No plug-ins. Use Trello on your desktop, tablet, and phone and go to reportsfortrello.com to see your activity. Track time in visual ways and see totals by the boards, members, and tasks. You can see all of your projects at a time (for some reason most time tracking apps are missing this feature).<p>ReportsforTrello.com is a little over 4 months old and it is free. There is no registration, use your Trello account to login. All processed data is erased after 24 minutes. See up-to-the-second reports any time you want. I built it to work the way I think a free site should work.<p>It has been a crazy first 4+ months. I did not expect people from 100+ countries to use my software. The site was a project for me to learn ruby, Sinatra, jquery, d3, and a bunch of other things I did not expect. I have spent way too much time making things faster and faster in the backend. I think I’ve hit a point where I can focus on the fun again. Coding all guts is not glory; I can’t wait to add more reports. I just added a new feature where it can see far back into your Trello history. I can see a whole year of activity in one board.

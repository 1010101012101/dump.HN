I believe that the difference in operating systems is being underestimated - if anything, they've diverged even more dramatically with Lion.<p>The large multitouch trackpad and the powerful gesture features feel less and less like a nicety and more like a necessity.  In an era where I'm doing more and more in Chrome and a handful of crossplatform apps, I'd love to jump back to a PC, but the trackpads are just painful. They're barely getting things like two-finger scrolling that Apple <i>nailed</i> five years ago.<p>Also, I appreciate Windows 7 in many ways, but the fit, finish and refinement on the UI and animations in Lion strike me as something that will always be a differentiating factor for many people shopping for a $1000 + system.",1315316491

He first illustrates it with file copying, and I think he is incredibly in the wrong there. He seems to think that developers are the kinds of folks who, on the way to copying a file, would <i>like</i> to be distracted with overall system information that they are apparently too clumsy to manage adequately. How often when you're programming do you think ""oh, I only have 3 gigs free, I think I'm going to do some spring cleaning!"" I'm a task-oriented fellow when I'm programming. I need as little distraction as possible. Everything he described is a distraction. Not everybody's like me, though. I'd like to hear other people's thoughts.<p>Then he explains how it can help during development with what sounds like the most horrifying GUI imaginable:<p><i>If you just got an exception, you should see the running code, the entire stack, the values of all variables, documentation for the currently selected function, system I/O, and on and on.</i><p>Dear jesus no - that is <i>so</i> much <i>crap</i>! At best, I want a stack trace, and I'm smart enough to handle myself from there. <i>Documentation</i> on an exception? What does he even mean by ""system I/O"" - a list of open file descriptors? Ugh. Ugh ugh ugh. More information in your face is not universally better in my humble opinion. Personally, in the systems I debug, almost everything he listed would just get in the way and piss me off.<p>2. <i>But, but, but… A good GUI can be controlled with the keyboard! A good GUI can be operated completely with the keyboard, and has good keyboard shortcuts for the most common tasks.</i><p>See, he starts to have a good point here, but misses why it fails to pass muster versus a shell.<p>He explains how he has a GUI git program and how it has nice keyboard shortcuts.

You have to alt-tab, locate the window, and context-switch your brain over to using a different program. <i>Every time</i> you have a task requiring a different program.<p>In the shell, I can do almost all of my daily tasks that I don't otherwise choose to do in the browser (though those could all be done from the shell if I wanted, and all those webapps have extensive keyboard shortcuts).

IMHO, the inadequacy that one feels during research does not arise from not knowing the answer, it is a result of not being able to figure out how to approach the problem and reaching an answer. More than this, most of the time you do not know what the appropriate question is.<p>This is not ignorance, sometimes you simply cannot weave the threads of knowledge you have to reach a pattern. Of course if you have more threads, your job becomes easier; and at some low level of knowledge you will have nothing interesting to ask, but this is not the major difficulty in completing a Ph.D. thesis, at least in my experience (which is in physics/astronomy).<p>This is what the author is talking about, it is not ""knowledge"" that is lacking, at least not knowledge in the sense that something you can learn from a book.

1900711,comment,1899310,1900484,0,0,JanezStupar,,,"Ehhh... that won't pay (don't you thin it would've been too easy?).<p>The problem is like the other person said - there are two blinds that travel around so in every cycle you get to pay 1.5 minimum bet (thus ensuring that you loose money if you don't play). As for the rakeback... you only qualify for return of the rake that you ""contributed"" by winning a pot. So for example, you win a pot of 1000$ and the casino takes 100$ in rake from that. After rakeback you receive 30$ of that original rake.<p>So many (most?) players rely on playing a break-even game and doing profit on rakeback. I read somewhere that pro's only win 7 big blinds per 100 hands (thats long term ofc). Thats little, very little.<p>Rake is something that people often underestimate - its the same mechanism casinos use with green pocket on roulette etc... Its used to give casino an edge. Rake ensures that if you keep playing long enough you will run out of money - now matter how well you play.",1289647463

We are excited to see this shift in attitude towards biotech investing and wanted to jump on board early.  What makes us a a fit for this is our business strategy that is a closer fit to the &quot;style&quot; of companies that come through YC.  For a typical biotech with clinical targets in mind, to bring those to market after FDA approval and clinical trials is a long process with returns being 7-12 years down the line. In our case, there is an identified research tools market that we can tap into first that would make us profitable by next year.  By establishing an early source of revenue, we mitigate risk for our investors.

Others may not like this but I always find it helpful.<p>Here&#x27;s Some critiques… \n3. Not sure you answered the question in your title: “How much will it cost build my startup MVP?” By the title I was looking for a breakdown by product type / business model. Assuming your giving feedback on building a software based product you can eliminate hardware plays, etc. But there’s a big MVP buildout cost difference from a photo sharing service, to a SaaS business, to a mobile messaging app. If you answer this in your second post, awesome! The only suggestion I would provide would be to put a good teaser at the end of this first post for the “stay tuned” and provide a little content hook for the reader.<p>4. To some extent, feel like you copied and pasted too much from the sources you referenced. Based on your impressive bio I would be stoked to hear about your experiences (the struggles, the triumphs). That’s what would really draw me in. I’ve read all those books and it’s always a good refresher for sure, but your own anecdotes and info would be gold to me! Show your personality and flair.<p>5. The structure of the post was hard to read. I would focus on a hierarchy of the content (lists are always great!). A few thoughts: inset quotes, pics, graphs, tables, indent the bolded sections).<p>All around, thanks for posting and look forward to following your story. Cheers!",1407458780

We never considered one of us being a stay-at-home parent since we both need the feeling of accomplishment that comes with working and put a lot into building our careers. And thankfully, our jobs are understanding when we have to leave early or stay home because our young daughter is sick, daycare is closed unexpectedly, etc. However, we always end up feeling guilty about it and worry their patience will wear thin soon. Additionally, it seems like we only have enough time to barely keep our heads above water at home, never mind be able to enjoy the few hours a day we get with our daughter. (We haven&#x27;t cleaned our house or mowed our lawn in over a month, and only read to her 2 or 3 times a week.)

This elaborate arrangement could have been designed to buy time for the rest of the group to hear about excavations and return to claim their share.<p>From having only read the article, my theory is that the band had discovered a naturally occurring shaft part-filled with sea water. They somehow blocked the base of the shaft then drained it with lowered buckets. It is feasible that their skin-divers were able to work from air pockets in the cavern below. Also, that the divers may have discovered a swimable route to open water.<p>With an empty shaft, they now needed to shore up and back-fill several times to make looting from below difficult and dangerous. They&#x27;d have been concerned about one of their number draining all the back-fill and treasure into the cavern using gunpowder. Hence they built many layers, each of which would have been very risky to tunnel into, even for someone who knew the design. The depth of the earth layers, partial air gap and strength of shoring materials might have been calculated to be particularly unstable, when not supported from below.<p>Since the treasure was be recovered from the top, it is most likely that the pit had worked exactly as intended. The treasure was already long gone before anyone else noticed the pit. Its trappings were left in place and made generations of greedy people the poorer. The message stone, if it existed, was a wind-up. Its spirit suggests it was done at the time of recovery. Pleased as they were to find everything as they&#x27;d left it. This had cost almost no effort for a lasting glow of satisfaction.<p>The pit itself had not been tremendously difficult to make either. So there is no reason to believe it had ever hidden more than just ordinary wealth.<p>This theory is not flawless. Nevertheless, I believe it makes sense to consider design parameters around building an untrusted network.",1407458637

8150892,comment,8149425,8150810,3,0,adwf,,,"I was about to say the exact same thing.  A lot of rules of writing happen to be current trends in literature, not actual hard and fast rules.<p>Adverbs are a useful language construct; if you teach people not to use them, they&#x27;ll end up with a stilted grasp of writing rather than a balanced one.<p>For example, from the article:<p>>  In our next class, I pointed out that using an adverb as a means of revealing a character&#x27;s thoughts or actions was almost always a tip-off that the writer is telling instead of showing. For example, if I write:<p>>    <i>Nancy yelled angrily whenever someone questioned her.</i><p>>...I&#x27;m getting my point across by telling the reader how the character reacts. Sure, this might be just fine at times, but it&#x27;s often better to write something like this:<p>>    <i>Nancy&#x27;s boss approached holding the report she&#x27;d turned in the day before. She felt her heart start to race – what was the problem now? She&#x27;d met her deadline. The clients would be happy.<p>>    &quot;Hey, Nancy,&quot; Jim said. &quot;I just wanted to ask you if you&#x27;re sure this is ready to go out with the courier. Did you double-check it? Triple-check it?<p>>    Nancy felt her face heat up, and the words were spilling out before she could stop herself. &quot;What do you think, Jim?&quot; she said, as she took a step towards him. &quot;Did I remember the most basic component of submitting a report? Did I?&quot;</i><p>But this is completely ignoring the negative effect:  You&#x27;ve replaced one line with a dozen or more.  You don&#x27;t necessarily need this, some things in your story <i>can</i> be glossed over.  If you don&#x27;t want your book&#x27;s word count to spiral out of control, maybe you need to cut some of this wasted text that&#x27;s better represented by a simple adverb....",1407457950

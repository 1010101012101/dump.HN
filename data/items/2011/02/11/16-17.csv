You should focus on one call-to-action button and acquire the user sign ups when submitting the idea in a slick user interface instead of trying to get them to click ""Register"" etc because, if they aren't submitting an idea there doesn't seem much value (if any) to join the service.<p>Additionally, when I went to click submit an idea I was immediately presented with ""Login"" or ""Register"" that really sucks from a user perspective, you should have a page with a form where people can fill out their information and at the bottom have a ""create account"" setting where a user registers a username, password and email etc (additional information can be acquired when they have signed up) as this will significantly improve the UI from a user perspective.<p>Also, why does it just have to be for ""ideas"" I mean you could contact charities to get them involved and they can get users to view the ads as a ""donation"" to their charities. Continuing with this idea, you should have a ""widget"" so people can place their ideas on another website etc, then they can go and view the ad such as on a Charities Website for instance.",1297443451

Have you had any bands use some of the functionality while you were working on it to get an idea of what they really wanted?</i><p>My old band used the original version of this app (it was overall much more basic than this but with all of the same functionality - if that makes any sense)... not to mention I know bands and exactly how the majority of them think when it comes to this boring stuff - I've been planning on adding a more guided approach.  I also know exactly what tour managers have to do... and the app takes care of 99% of it - which is actually mainly who this is for.  You'll just have to take my word for it... this app is exactly what tour managers need.  They do everything on paper first and transfer it to excel later.<p>I really like the idea of reducing the feature set,,, but at the same time I feel like the culmination of all of the features is really what's going to reel in the management, booking agencies, and record labels - which is who I'm really after (more money there!)... individual bands are a plus.",1297442159

Which would be: what is going on in [some/most] of our brain is something more than or very different from 'just' statistical inference and optimization. Right now, we don't know whether this is true or not but more people are beginning to think not.<p>For example let us consider that based on time of day and knock you can guess who is most likely at your door. How why, can you know this? Have you learned or figured out anything there?<p>Or say, I tell you that a person is of gender X, race Y and lives in city Z. You will automatically <i>generate</i> an idea of what this person is like. And it will be different from what I would generate and these <i>data points</i> would likely mean nothing of significance to a 3 year old. Why? Because we have learned a model from our past experience/data. Machine Learning also uses generative models to infer situations. And in fact, we humans perform a very weak form of machine learning. It goes by the name of <i>stereotyping</i> or profiling.<p>When you are trying to figure out something. The process is not some clean logical step by step deduction. It is more like a search with dead ends (local optimums), back tracking and restarts. Trying and throwing away different ideas. Or when trying to learn a new sport, dance or flip. You do not consider the physics of the situations to try and figure amount the correct amount of impulses to apply. You try again and again to learn or statistically generate a satisfactory approximate local optimum of the correct physics model for the situation at hand.<p>As for systems which generate code. We can look at it most literally in terms of those which evolve rules in some way or loosely by considering that all machine learning does is use lots of data to prevent the programmer from hand coding a giant restricted system. Regardless of your stance, these systems differ from mere rewriting in that they are not deterministic. They interact and respond to different situations in varying ways. The more sophisticated methods can develop new algorithms - a set of rules - that were not programmed and make no sense to the developer to develop behaviours to cope with their situations. It is true that we provide a base, but that does not mean some limited form of learning is not occurring. What Machine learning cannot do that we can is introspect, abstract and generalize across domains.<p>I am the reverse of you. Before I picked up machine learning I thought the brain was something special. But now I cant help but feel that we are just clever marionettes and that whats going on is simply mundane mathematics by clever co-opting of physics by nature. I find this fact to be amazingly beautiful.",1297441737

Imagine an implementation that does a binary search through the characters of a file; when it lands in the middle of the line, it seeks back by one character until it finds the beginning of the line, and then compares that line to the timestamp given.<p>70GB will require approximately 36 binary searches to find the line you want.  Assuming the lines are around 200 characters long, each binary search will require on average 100 seeks backward to find the beginning of the line.  From there you can read the characters you need for the timestamp.<p>So your total cost is going to be 36 * (1 seek to the character, 100 seeks to the beginning of the line, a read from that offset), disregarding the almost certainly irrelevant cost of comparison to the timestamp.  Note that these seeks, while still calls to seek(2), are not actual random disk seeks, because disks return blocks to the OS in 16KB chunks or so.  Most of those seeks will just be a quick roundtrip through the kernel.<p>So you'll do, on average, 36 reads and 3636 seeks.

It may be a thousand times better than the first, and it may still need improvement, but what is more important is the actual product.  And right now from what I've seen that needs work.<p>I think the main concern I have comes from the fact that you spent ""7 months by myself glued to a computer"".  How much have you talked to users in this time?  Have you had any bands use some of the functionality while you were working on it to get an idea of what they really wanted?<p>The home video looks like you have an incredible amount of features, but with little emphasis on usability or design.  I'm intimidated by your website.  It may be able to produce 30 kinds of graphs, but if I don't like using it or won't take the time to learn most of them, it doesn't matter.  There is some stuff there that sounds really cool; like the idea of Myspace integration.  But the cool stuff gets lost with all of the features that band members may not really care for (the merch section with pictures seems quite separate from event planning).<p>I think it's a cool idea with potential.  I'm not sure what the technical expertise and design expectations of band managers is, and perhaps they only have really poor software to do similar things.  But if I were a potential user, I'd like you to select one or two really cool features, make those well designed, and take the rest away until I ask for them or put them in the back menus for the hardcore users.  That would give your site a really simplistic message and could leave me demanding more; maybe in the form of an additional pay-for content.  Which features should these be?  I don't know, talk to band managers.<p>If you can find one, it would be really useful if you could get a designer to help you with this.  If not, just bring it to bands that you know, get them to use it (for free), and talk to them regularly.<p>I really don't mean to sound critical.  I'm a 20, and I've been working on a website for 4 months now, though probably not as hard as you have (because of school).  It's still been pretty tough for me, and I give you a ton of credit for lasting so long while working on something you care about.  This is an incredibly comprehensive website.  If you did cut it down a bit, the nice part is that it seems like all the backend is already done, so most of the work is complete.  I just don't know how much longer you are willing to endure on this.  Websites can be quite depressing when you have few users.<p>Having gone seven months working on this alone, based on your own idea, is something few of my friends are capable of.  In the case that it doesn't work out you have still done something very impressive and can live knowing that you've finished something original.

2206748,comment,2206422,2206422,0,0,nika,,,"I've never understood the objection to MPEGLA.<p>I'm neutral on patents* but this is probably the best environment for patents in the entire world.  MPEGLA is a licensing agency, so there are no personal or political issues. They make money by increasing the number of licensees.  Those who submit patents to them ofload a lot of work that they otherwise would have to engage in for marketing the patents.<p>Finally the patent pools allow for standards to be created and propagated under fair terms.  Fierce competitors like Microsoft and Apple can participate together and have an incentive to contribute patents to the pool.<p>And as was otherwise mentioned the existence of the pool mitigates risk that there might be a patent you don't know about.<p>Everybody who participates in the pool wins, and the pool is a much more efficient mechanism of licensing patents than doing it one by one in an environment of uncertainty, or doing it at the end of a long litigation that you have lost and are thus pushed over the barrel.<p>Further, I don't understand why the risk of patents for VP8 is called FUD.  I'm certain a good chunk of the patents in the current MPEGLA pool cover VP8 because of the nature of patents (they have to be broadly written) the nature of our patent system (things have to be patented, because even if you invented it, someone else can patent it if you don't) and the nature of video encoding (you're essentially forced by the nature of video and the desire to compress to recognize features of images that exist in multiple frames and then encode based on them, this is an essential component of MPEG-4 video & h.264, and unless a fundamental patent for this has expired, and all derivative improvements have also expired, which I doubt, h.264 patents are going to cover VP8 encoding, unless VP8 somehow does not use any feature extraction.)<p>Thus, MPEGLA will have a pool that people can go to license the VP8 patents.  If google wants to contribute their patents (assuming they have some) to the pool then they will get licensing compensation.  If they don't then that doesn't change the fact that MPEGLA is legitimately protecting the rights of the patent holders for patents that VP8 infringes on.<p>That VP8 infringes on patents is pretty much a sure thing-- unless I'm fundamentally misunderstanding how VP8 works, and even still, there are patents on many other aspects of video and video containers.<p>Don't be mad at the patent holders for protecting their work- they published it for everyone to benefit from in exchange.<p>--<p>* If you've got a better idea for how intellectual property should be protected or not, then, please start a political movement.  Don't go after people following he laws as they are.  Given the existence of the system, companies must patent and defend their patents.  And given that this is the state of the legal framework in the country, suing people for patent violation is perfectly legitimate.  The patent is a trade- you reveal your solution in exchange for legal protection. If you cannot sue, then you are not getting the compensation you are promised in this system for revealing your invention.  If you wish to go to a system whereby there is no patent system, then recognize that people wouldn't be revealing their inventions, and thus things like android couldn't exist, because they wouldn't have a source of technology to copy.",1297440128

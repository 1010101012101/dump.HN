As far as I can see, the only valid reason for working on a startup part-time is risk/cost tolerance or some obscure personal situation.<p>Some 'advantages':<p>>You can fund your own startup.<p>Refer pg's equity equation. I'd love to have sequoia/YC worry about my company in addition to my co-founders.<p>> No one is going to kick you because your took money from them for your FAILED startup. No one even cares if your startup fails<p>That's not necessarily an upside. I think most people can deal with personal failure a lot better than letting someone else down. This affects motivation. To quote Bezos:\nJeff Bezos: I think one thing I find very motivating -- and I think this is probably a very common form of motivation or cause of motivation -- is... I love people counting on me, and so, you know, today it's so easy to be motivated, because we have millions of customers counting on us at Amazon.com. We've got thousands of investors counting on us. And we're a team of thousands of employees all counting on each other. That's fun.<p>>If you love coding then you can enjoy it 24/7<p>Try it and notice your efficiency. I'd actually recommend switching roles for your day job and night job.<p>Regardless, Kudos for being the one-legged man - this shit ain't easy.",1195210581

80584,story,,,13,20,theyoungceo,"Ask YC: What to do when VCs think opportunity/market is too small?",,"Hi all, I've been a reader here since the beginning but never posted. Anyway, my question:<p>1. I am the 100% owner of company X, several others are involved, but not full time. \n2. X has generated $100K revenue in FY1 and is $60K since new fiscal 7/1. \n3. I have not paid myself a dime yet, because I can afford to live off savings and business needs the revenue for R&D, marketing, etc.\n4. X is the recent winner of a major CA-based business plan competition - $100K prize.\n5. VCs are sold on the pitch -- product, team, competition, IP, everything. They like it.<p>The problem is this: Even with a $4.4B one-time revenue and $1.6B recurring annual revenue market, they think the opportunity is too small. Due to the revenue X is generating, capital needs are much smaller because each customer added means substantial revenue. However, the market is not as small!<p>To quote one VC: ""If we put $1M in and we realize a fantastic return of 20x, that's still a small bet for us. We chase bigger opportunities"".<p>So I'm thinking angels are a good idea, but the angel groups seem too process-oriented: several months to get considered, lots of structure, very few deals invested in and usually not over $500K. Further, I'm hearing that Silicon Valley based angel groups are highly biased towards local investments -- X is run out of Los Angeles. <p>My quandary is: how do I raise a smaller amount of capital from smaller funds or angels, at a fair valuation given current traction, without a lot of network to start with? <p>I've gotten introductions through the competition we won and VCs, but things haven't panned out substantially yet. Disclaimer: I've only been at it for a few weeks and lots of avenues still cooking, but I'm just looking for YC advice on fundraising related to smaller capital needs.<p>Any comments ?",1195208898

If the target is complete newbies, then their competition is not Photoshop, but a whole series of cheap/free/comes-with-the-machine tools, like Picasa, iPhoto, Photoshop Elements, etc.",1195207710

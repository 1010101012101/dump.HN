At first, one might just toy around with it without sufficiently reading the documentation. Before long, one will learn to use it correctly, but not before getting a lot of error messages. That does not mean the software is impossible to use.<p>Lojban is similar, except that the only place you get error messages in Lojban is from other users. What you are seeing is a symptom of how active the Lojban community is, especially since being featured in an xkcd comic. Many newbies are attempting it before learning it. You are seeing a process of welcoming and educating newcomers that has become the norm in our community.<p>Consider the hypothetical software package again. You may wish to do something weird with it that is at the edges of its scope. You may need to make a feature request, or report flaky performance at a level for which the software is rarely used.<p>That is what you are seeing as well. Our debugging committee, the BPFK, is hashing out a lot of edge cases. However, these edge cases are tangential to the day-to-day usage of almost anyone, which is bug-free.<p>-Matt Arnold, President, Logical Language Group",1257616716

928073,comment,927724,927839,0,0,Tichy,,,"I have to disagree. Sure, if you go through that chore, you'll probably end up being a cool hacker. However, systems programming might not be what you really want to do (maybe you want to be a cool Hacker of JavaScript frameworks or whatever). I think it is better to work on stuff you really want to do. Maybe you want to create games - if at some point you realize your game's performance sucks, you can still dive down and learn all the other stuff. In other words, learning systems programming first is just premature optimization.<p>I don't even think learning stuff just for the sake of learning it even works. You always need some reason to learn stuff to really need it. For example, you can't learn photoshop by reading a book about photoshop. You have to try to accomplish something.<p>So set yourself a real goal, ""I want to become a good programmer"" doesn't count, something you want to build. Perhaps try to write a MMORPG - everybody will tell you that you will fail, but who knows.<p>I think it is very stupid to assume that after one year of learning C you can not yet program good enough to do anything. Set yourself a goal, then try to figure out how to achieve it. In fact, in my opinion, the job of a software developer is not to be good at some kind of programming language and then routinely solve problems with that skill. The job is to constantly learn new skills and to adapt to new requirements. Therefore the attitude ""I am not good enough"" is the exact opposite attitude of the attitude a programmer should have.<p>Disclaimer: I never got into C Systems programming myself. Probably I suck as a programmer - so what. We all do.<p>Edit2: Flicking through ""Programming Clojure"" only requires an afternoon, ""Progamming Erlang"" could be read in a weekend. Why don't you (the original poster) consider what you want to do, then evaluate a few possible paths (different languages, frameworks), pick one and get coding? Choosing a language just because of popular vote seems rather risky.<p>Edit3: Your MMOPRG's code will probably shit. User's will never know and won't care, though. Your second MMORPG's code will be shit in a very different way. And so on...",1257615386

928070,comment,927724,927839,0,0,apu,,,"I often see this kind of advice and it always reeks of ""I went through this and I turned out ok, so you should do it too.""<p>The problem is that I think it's completely the wrong thing to do. One of the major effects of programming in a language extensively is that you start to ""think"" in that language whenever you have a new problem. This is both good and bad, of course, because while it helps you become proficient in the language, it also prevents you from seeing possibly simpler solutions (i.e., that aren't easier in your language).<p>Also, languages don't arise in a vacuum -- they're designed in a certain time period, with various assumptions about environment and hardware baked right in. This can be extremely dangerous because as a user of the language, you will start to think in terms of those limitations as well, even if they no longer apply! So for example, C is one of these languages I'd strongly NOT recommend, unless you're working in a domain where it's necessary/preferred (low-level networking, some embedded devices, etc). C assumes you live in a time when computers are quite slow and have little memory (both of which must be very carefully monitored), there's only 1 processing core (so you can just do sequential programming), and programmer time is less valuable than execution time (so you can spend days optimizing the hell out of small routines). But the times have changed -- computers are fast, they all have multiple processors, there's a lot of RAM, etc. Most people want to be building more complex things, and for 95% of applications, I'd wager that C is exactly the wrong language to be ""thinking"" in.<p>Starting with a more ""modern"" language (which includes the LISPs, despite them being older) lets you avoid these preconceptions.<p>Also, there seems to be a lot of penance involved in the parent's advice -- ""you need to pay your dues first and get your hands dirty."" Fuck that shit.<p>Sure, if your end goal to is to really learn this low-level stuff, then go for it. But if your interests lie elsewhere, do that instead by jumping right into that domain. Maybe you want to build large distributed systems, or come up with new visualization tools, or build a logic system. C seems like a remarkably bad choice for these and so many other projects. In fact, it seems like a bad choice to even learn C first, precisely because your notions of what's possible, of the ""right"" way of approaching problems will become infected with the C mindset.<p>Most importantly, motivation is a key resource you must not squander. For many people, fixing broken computers, struggling with a difficult operating system, or looking at assembly and network packets is grueling work with no payoff. I'd be willing to bet that for such people (many of whom could be great hackers in other domains), the parent's advice is sure to sap your morale and turn you off from programming.<p>Finally, time is not an infinite resource either. Why waste your life on things that don't interest you and won't help you much in the long-term? Work on things that excite you, and you'll not only be so much happier, but you'll also learn much more in the long run.<p>P.S. I know several ""real hackers""/""good programmers"" and while some of them might fit the parent's description of such, many of them also fit the parent's description of the poseurs -- the A-student in my class back in college, the guy recording lectures in polo shirts and khakis, the family man with a wife and kids and a mortgage. Stereotyping is still stereotyping when applied in the opposite direction.",1257615244

928067,comment,927757,927757,0,0,oldgregg,,,"I spent 7 years helping to build one of the largest speaking bureaus in the country before leaving a couple years ago to launch an unrelated startup. Couple observations:<p>The business is dominated by celebrities. If you are an event planner often all you care about is getting people to show up-- so you'll pay $30k for a celebrity who is a lousy speaker over $5k for someone who is a real expert.<p>We made a real effort to develop some tech related speakers but it was difficult to do. It's not worth it for a large agency to book 1-2k engagements. More importantly, if you want to have a speaking career you have to be consistent in your pricing. You can't charge someone $5k for a speech and then give your next speech away for $500. Most tech speakers if you tell them they can't accept any dates less than $5k they really don't like that. Often what has gotten them recognition is giving away their content (both on the web and speaking) for free or nearly-free and so the shift is hard to make because in the short term they have to turn down free exposure.<p>Sadly most of the tech speakers making 10-20k are total wankers. You've probably never heard of them and they are mostly full of shit. They haven't done anything particularly remarkable but they have their pitch down and know how to sell it to bureaus and CEOs. I've seen people walk away with $15k for a one hour talk about how second life is the future of business accompanied by a walk through-- and the audience walks away with a big chubby.

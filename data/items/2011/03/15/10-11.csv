2326838,comment,2326545,2326545,0,0,jamii,,,"TeX is great for typesetting but it does very little else. It's a nightmare to parse and analyse. The equation language doesn't convey any information about the equation other than it's appearance (eg syntactic scope, semantics). This makes it really hard to build things like search engines or screen readers (screen readers for LaTeX tend to end up saying things like 'sum-symbol subscript x equals zero superscript infinity x subscript one superscript two plus x subscript two superscript two' rather than 'the sum from x = 0 to infinity of x one squared plus x two squared).<p>I spent months building an equation search engine for Springer's math/science corpus so I've experienced the pain and horror of parsing LaTeX first hand. HTML + Semantic MathML is so much easier to work with. Its easy to parse, it allows the author to easily convey scope and semantic information and it can handle resizable displays. It just needs better tooling (eg a sane macro language which outputs MathML).",1300186587

I actually don't know the figures, but I know what sort of argument it would take to convince me: some numbers showing that nuclear power production takes a substantially higher toll on life and health than other forms of energy production, measured by kWh. This number determines whether producing the same amount of power by other means is going to save people, or kill people. (Yes, it's not out of the question that environmentalist activism kills people. Good intentions don't protect from bad consequences.) Maybe the people who advocate stopping nuclear power should cite their acceptable figures of death toll per kWh produced, and then we can compare with oil and coal. Emotional arguments only get us so far.<p>As regarding sustainable energy, here's my favorite book on the subject: <a href=""http://withouthotair.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://withouthotair.com</a> .

Making the web functional enough that it would compete with desktop apps would lessen their lock-in and reduce their future revenue.

Oh dear.<p>Re: ``C is more Harvard than von Neumann architecture''. Hardly; C is architecture agnostic. You can compile it for a Harvard PIC as well as for von Neumann CPU.<p>It may seem functions are execute-only, but on common CPUs you can treat them as data as well: read and modify (modulo memory protection).\nAnd the other way around too -- you can load a bunch of bytes from a DLL, resolve symbols to obtain pointers and use the pointers to execute the loaded bytes as functions.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons</a>",1300184884

2326772,comment,2325018,2326001,0,0,potatolicious,,,"""Lose"" is relative I suppose - Flickr has a hard lock on much of the photographic community. FB Photos is still limited to vacation photos, wild nights out, etc. There's not a great deal of hard photography going on there - a photographer's social graph is inevitably a lot of non-photogs, and Flickr's ability to discover and participate across vast social graphs is powerful for photographers. FB's limitation of requiring social graph adjacency for most levels of participation is a liability for this use case.<p>So sure, SmugMug and FB are destroying Flickr as a tool for Joe Average's image uploads, but as a photographic community I honestly don't think it's doing so badly. From a monetization standpoint it's not a bad bet - you would have a hard time selling a Flickr Pro account to the average FB user. But $20/yr. as a ticket price for a ludicrous number of amateur to professional photographers? No brainer.",1300184798

Part of this was a result of my work in FFMpeg improving crash and corruption resilience. I wouldn't have worked on this if I didn't feel that VLC is a good project, so I apologize if you thought my comment misrepresented the project or the developers.

They are sobering, but actually achievable.<p>A common thread among those who create actual concrete plans for running on renewable energy is this: <i>We must use less energy to have our energy needs met by renewable sources.</i><p>(Their projections do account for the growth of newly industrialized nations, so it's not double-trouble.)<p>Some of the use-less-energy changes we would notice (how we get the food that reaches our table), and other changes we could integrate and not notice at all (lots of energy escapes buildings for no good reason, and that could change with different process + design becoming more dominant).<p>A cool part is that they don't see higher cost as long-term issue (that renewable energy is only temporarily expensive because it's uncommon and used in small doses).<p>Another kinda optimistic thing is that parts of the world that are still becoming ""industrialized"" have somewhat of an advantage (as they do with leapfrogging any kind of tech generation), and in some cases are being born with more renewable systems to begin with.<p>I completely understand those who overlook renewable sources because of the amount of energy we <i>currently</i> use is more than we can produce with them. It's not a dumb conclusion. But after going over these reports, I don't think using less energy is any more of an imposition than changing any other kind of infrastructure, and in many cases is stuff we're moving towards anyway.<p><a href=""http://getsatisfaction.com/wwf/topics/debate_the_energy_report"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getsatisfaction.com/wwf/topics/debate_the_energy_repo...</a>\n<a href=""http://assets.panda.org/downloads/101223_energy_report_final_print_2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://assets.panda.org/downloads/101223_energy_report_final...</a> [pdf, pdf, pdf! i warned you]\n<a href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/er-ship/Global/international/publications/climate/2010/summary.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenpeace.org/er-ship/Global/international/publi...</a> [pdf]",1300184056

I'm interested in your perspective on whether it is a good idea to try to introduce students to the acoustic/mathematical derivation of the scale. To provide context for non-technical readers, the physical basis of harmonic intervals is integer ratios of frequencies, and European tempered tuning systems create scales and chords as a pragmatic adjustment of mathematically pure tuning to the necessity of using a finite number of predetermined pitches for instruments such as the piano.<p>I am still unsure as to whether the deeper understanding of scales, chords, keys, tuning, and temperament is something I should push to make students study and understand. Many students have a negative reaction to even the simplest math, but other students get a lot of benefit from understanding exactly how and why a given set of pitches fit together to form chords and scales.

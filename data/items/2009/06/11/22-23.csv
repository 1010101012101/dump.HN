653823,comment,653757,653757,0,0,SamAtt,,,"Only a ""new technology"" expert would write something so unbelievably dumb.  And I don't even disagree with him.<p>Yes, the teacher that sits at a podium and delivers a lecture is worse than a teacher that's interactive with students.  That's always been the case.  When I went to college they even had names for them.  ""Good Teacher"" and ""Bad Teacher"" we called them.<p>There's nothing inherently different about this new generation.  It's certainly not going to bring down the University.  Heck, as long as tenure exists it won't even bring down the bad teachers.<p>For better or worse (probably worse) college has become more an experience than a learning institution.  Kids go to college to avoid the world for 4 more years and get a credential for their trouble.  Anyone interested in learning (like I was with computers) knows most of the curriculum before they walk in the door and is just there to get a diploma.<p>Honestly, the first 2 years is dedicated to reteaching what you already learned in High School.  That should be a hint.",1244761095

653814,comment,652412,652562,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"Our financialized economy causes bubbles. During many bubbles, the results of a massive, artificial credit infusion reach some sector(s) of the economy. This results in a lot of short-term economic waste, as well as some people getting rich far out of proportion to the wealth they have created. (More specifically, richer than they would've become under similar circumstances in a free market economy without government-backed financialization.)<p>You can see this when Wall Street traders blow $100,000 on a night of entertainment, and you can also see it on a smaller scale when excessive financing through a VC reaches a company which then sometimes wastes the excess money.<p>Coming back to this article, Matt seems like a nice, productive guy, so this wasn't really a good example of what I'm talking about. There are some people in the Bay Area, though, who are in the ""startup scene"" largely to party, socialize, spend lots of money in extravagant ways, and attempt to get rich quick -- this is the ""bubble lifestyle"" I referred to. I know there are at least a few others here on HN who have seen firsthand what I'm talking about, because it's been mentioned before.<p>So, when I saw the mention of dual 30"" monitors, 2 laptops a year, prime SF real estate, eating out all the time, etc. I was reminded of the bubble lifestyle. Sometimes, for people who are used to being frugal, this kind of thing just jumps out at you. Many hackers are frugal people -- PG seems to be one of them, because I remember him saying something about being impressed that a Yahoo co-founder went poking around Viaweb servers to see if there was any unnecessary use of resources, even though Yahoo was already big and he was already rich.<p>Before someone downvotes this comment, I want to reiterate that I don't mean to denigrate Matt at all. In Matt's case, it could very well be that the expenditures are worthwhile and even necessary. But I was just reminded of others who are just in it for the lifestyle.",1244760954

Those laws need to be enforced, and parents need to pursue those laws to the fullest extent to protect their children.”<p>The idea that destroying the rest of a young man's life because his daughter sent him a naked picture is just twisted.  Being labeled as a sex offender is no small matter.  It's much worse morally than going and beating the shit out of the kid (assuming no long-term damage).  If convicted the kid's life is ruined.<p>Furthermore, if the law is going to protect his daughter (assuming some harm to her), then the proper application would be to prosecute his own daughter and send her to jail. Of course that's ridiculous too, but not as ridiculous as prosecuting the boy.<p>Now I understand the guy is upset and I don't totally blame him for acting irrationally, but the legal system needs to step in and set some precedents here.",1244759824

At a more conceptual level, what sorts of problems does your work attempt to solve for its customers?  From there, ask yourself what other problems could be solved for the customers?  Were any potentially profitable ones overlooked?  What other existing technologies that you are not presently working with can be used to solve those same problems more cost effectively?  Looking at the technology set, what other related problems can you solve that either no business is currently working on or that you could solve cheaper/better/faster, etc?<p>The intent behind this questioning is the important thing.  In an evolutionary context, the work you're doing is like an organism that is adapted to some degree to its business niche.  You may be able to strike out on your own by making a business 'better adapted' to the same economic niche through changes in the technology/skills used.  Alternately, you may be able to find a niche that better supports the toolkit you presently have to work with.  This is the simplest way to generate innovation but it will likely not produce results that are the best for your overall happiness.<p>For that, you'll have to determine what kind of niche can support you financially and which you personally are well suited for.

It also shouldn't line-break stuff like patches that are >80 characters wide.<p>I'd like it to be as open as possible, so no need to register to post, and preferably an easy registration process, like just entering your email address, or subscribing by sending an email (like mailman does).<p>I don't really want to host this myself, so I'm looking for a hosted solution, which should be free. It'd be nice if it had some support for this workflow, but shouldn't get in our way.

It would also be great to have a spamfilter working on the web interface.<p>Anyone know of something that we can use? Google Groups seems to be the big guy here, but I don't really like it.

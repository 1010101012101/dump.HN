As we have bootstrapped we didnt have the money for great design and did the best we could! That said it hasnt been the make or break as we have executed well, however first impressions always count... and when looking for investment we have more than once had potential investors misjudge how far we have come or compare us negatively to others in our space as we did not have the design 'edge'.  Its a shame, but its a fact of life appearances mean a lot..<p>Perhaps off topic but be interesting to know how others have managed to overcome gaps in skillsets when bootstrapping?  we dont seem to have any contacts with good design skills and available time..",1324025921

3360038,comment,3357522,3358997,3,0,bermanoid,,,"<i>Gender is entirely a social construct very loosely tied to biology but not at all determined by it.</i><p>This doesn't sound plausible.<p>[tl;dr: If evolution didn't build in a powerful urge to make our gender behavior match our reproductive sex, then it made a huge error and missed a very easy and effective optimization.]<p>It may be the case that gender <i>could be</i> very loosely tied to biology in a philosophical or theoretical sense, but in the world that we're in right now, there are very strong adaptive reasons that gender expression and reproductive sex tend to stay close (statistically, of course) in any sexually dimorphic species, which I'd call a very strong ""tie to biology"".<p>Evolution 101-wise, gender can only be allowed to diverge from reproductive sex to a limited enough extent that it's more or less irrelevant to reproductive success. Evolution will make sure of that on a long enough time scale (at least up until the modern era, where we can to some extent decouple reproduction from sex).<p>If the two diverged commonly enough that animals were often foregoing sex with reproductively compatible partners in favor of incompatible ones that nevertheless matched the gender role they were interested in, then an adaptation that better facilitated reproductive matchings would easily emerge and dominate the population.<p>Note that such a compensating adaptation might even emerge as some form of social behavior, even if the impetus to that behavior was genetically driven; IMO, this doesn't make it any less tied to biology.<p>As an example, one suggestion [1] to solve the ""gay problem"" in evolution (why has full homosexuality, where a person is not at all attracted to members of the opposite sex, not been eradicated from the gene pool, since it should be so devastating to reproduction rates?) is that getting rid of the ""gay gene"" (or genes, or whatever) is actually a very difficult task for evolution to carry out (I'm anthropomorphizing evolution here for ease of speaking, not because I don't realize why that's wrong) for some reason. Difficult enough so that accepting the ~10% homosexuality rate was a better option, though obviously not ideal. So instead of getting rid of homosexuality, evolution tried to mitigate the ""damage"" that such behavior causes by enhancing an inclination for people to disapprove of it, which meant that even when people/animals were fully homosexual, they still tended to mate with members of the other sex due to social pressure. Thus the seemingly fitness-devastating 10% homosexuality rate was bumped down to a more ignorable number via social effects, and the presence of the gene was a net win. This is not to say that there's a ""homophobia gene""; if this theory is correct, I'd guess that evolution more likely leveraged existing social behaviors (like wanting to fit in, or hating people that act differently) and turned them up to a slightly higher level.<p>In the case of gender identity, I suspect that there <i>is</i> a heavy dosage of social conformity involved in training people to signal their reproductive sex through gendered behavior. But I think it's biologically driven, or at least that it would be extremely surprising if it wasn't, since it's such low-hanging fruit. I'm sure that these biological imperatives are somewhat flexible, and that if pink was considered a boy color then boys would flock to the pink section of Toys R Us, rather than these things being hard-coded into the genome (though certain behaviors are definitely going to be hard-coded, since sex signaling had to take place before higher-level thought centers could be leveraged). But the inclination to figure out what these socially derived sex-signaling behaviors are is not a social construct - that's an evolutionary imperative, so while we may be able to change the particular expressions of gender that we see in the world, it's probably going to be rather difficult to prevent people from seeking them out and conforming to them.<p>This is why I'm always uncomfortable with nature vs. nurture questions - the environment that evolution optimizes any particular genome to succeed in includes the entire existing social structure, which was also influenced by previous rounds of evolution. So picking apart what is a ""social construct"" and what is ""biological"" is really a fool's errand, when it comes down to it - there's a delicate interplay between the two, and they always play off of each other.<p>[1] I should mention, there are other theories as well, the simplest being that even with the ""gay gene"", a person is only sometimes fully homosexual (twin studies have shown that homosexuality is definitely not 100% determined by DNA, though it's not 0%, either), so they do rather limited damage, and if tied to useful adaptations, there would be no particular evolutionary imperative to get rid of such a gene; the point, though, is that such arguments only hold up to a point, and if a large percentage of the population was gay, there would be much more selection pressure against that behavior, tamping down the ratio rather quickly to a lower level.",1324025118
3360037,comment,3359245,3359736,1,0,repsilat,,,"""Culture"" subreddits (/r/askscience in particular, sometimes /r/truereddit and the ones like it) are still mostly alright, though they still get bad when posts hit the front page. A good set of default subreddits is absolutely essential.<p>HN has some of that emphasis on civility, but it (and the moderation system) are certainly less visible than reddit's. Hellbanning certainly has quite a different effect to pages full of deleted comments' ""tombstones"". I think the passivity of HN will could speed a cultural decline, and the lack of things like subreddits will certainly limit its usefulness if it ever does happen.<p>Even with its countermeasures, though, I'm falling out of love with Reddit.

Making sure everyone has the latest version is a hard enough problem even without politics.<p>The take home lesson is that getting your language onto every desktop is hard and probably not worth the effort.<p>Which is sad because the best thing about Java was always how it was OS agnostic.  People always used to say about Java ""write once, run anywhere""... but that was wrong.  It was better than that.  It was _compile_ once, run anywhere.<p>I recently grabbed some of my old (1996) Java code from storage and then ran it on my desktop.  The desktop was using a different OS, different chip architecture, everything was different from the machine it was originally compiled on.  After 15 years it still ran perfectly.<p>C is a ""write once run anywhere"" language, but you have to recompile it for each different platform, which often turns out to be non-trivial.

Fourteen were land speculators. Twenty-four were money-lenders. Eleven were merchants. Fifteen were slave-holders.

I don't like the ""Us vs Them"" logic applied to startups - whether it's employees vs founders or founders vs VCs. Everyone is trying to make money and the reason why the upside is bigger for some is the same as in any other business - because they take more risk.<p>The founders should get the biggest upside, then investors (and among those the early investors more), then early employees, then all other employees. The founders risk their reputation, personal life, money and often friends' money to start a company. Investors put their money at risk at a stage when it's not clear if the company is going to succeed. And early employees put a bet on a company that can be gone in less than a year.<p>If you're not an early employee, you shouldn't bear with any corporate risk, which means that you should earn your market salary, no discounts. Because of that, the equity share can't be high because you're not really taking much risk.<p>Some people are more aggressive taking risks then others and that's why the market works<p>You say ""why enrich other people?"". Well, everyone is enriching someone else. If you own resources so valuable that others are willing to pay lots of money for, someone will make you rich. Find a way to make yourself indispensable, as a founder, investor or employee, and someone will make you rich.",1324022901

As an example consider Santiago Calatrava; there are probably several thousand people who know as much or more as he does about the history and engineering principles of building bridges, but he adds unique value to the projects he is given that would be difficult if not impossible for another engineer to duplicate. <p>The knowledge economy is a bit of a misnomer because by it's very nature knowledge creates multiple measures of value, not all of which can be measured in terms of _valuta_. It's also problematic in that knowledge is embodied in individuals, and while you can build information systems that support  it's cultivation in individuals, it is not possible to treat knowledgeable individuals as interchangeable plug-compatible components.",1197140392
87308,comment,87289,87300,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I disagree on the soft RAID vs. hardware RAID (if by soft RAID, you mean the md layer in Linux).  I'm not a fan of hardware RAID, in general.  I wrote the following ages ago on Slashdot in response to the same kind of disparaging statement about soft RAID:<p>The data integrity benefits are still present, as are some performance benefits in some circumstances (in fact, Linux RAID is demonstrably faster in some workloads than a top end Adaptec hardware RAID controller, though this is the exception rather than the rule)<p>That said, I hate pretty much all RAID controllers (whether software or hardware). Linux software RAID means that I can drop the disks into any PC and access the data. Every RAID controller from Promise, Adaptec, and Tektronic requires me to use their disk format, and if I lose the controller I lose the data until I can get another controller. Sure, in high availability environments, you keep a spare...but with Linux software RAID, every PC in the office is a spare controller. That's my kinda redundancy. I've even had two identical Adaptecs with different firmware lead to pretty massive data loss during a server migration. Thankfully there were good backups. I've never had similar problems moving Linux software RAID disks into a new Linux box.",1197140309
87307,comment,87274,87274,0,0,DocSavage,,,"I think you're overly cynical.  Docs don't need monetary incentives for ""keeping the patient healthy."" They need proof that something is wrong and a simple remedy will fix it and help patients.  Not every doc, particularly those with relatively fixed salaries, are rushing to see patients to maximize their personal wealth.  I'd think it was financial pressures to reduce costs at the institutional level that create an imbalance between # of caregivers and the # of patients.  I've seen some new medical practices (e.g., here in Palo Alto) where you can pay a lot more and get seen by docs with a relatively very low patient load.",1197138993

I will take in the leads that come in from the site and evaluate them for business ideas and I will play around with the system and see if there isn't something that someone would pay for using it.  I would be willing to spend $299 a month plus the cost of a few servers.  Hopefully the code is not so balkanized it is not unmanagable.",1197136937

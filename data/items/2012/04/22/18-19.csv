It's something they CAN learn from, but that doesn't mean they necessarily will. Some people hit a road block and rather than overcome, they just blog about how hard it is.

I feel like shit and just drink. The next day, I go to work same as every day and put my all into it.<p>In my opinion, it's not about working hard, or necessarily finishing things, or any of that.

And when he was talking about starting conversations with people you don't know on the street, he said quite interesting thing about messing up: Either you will have a nice chat or you will have funny story. So in both cases it will go great.\nAnd while I still don't have courage to talk to people on street, I started applying this in the rest of my life. And my life started getting much better, since I stopped to worry so much. I made new friends and got closer with the ones I had and I became happier too.\nSo, try to enjoy life more and worry less.

I know people who have built homes in Chiang Mai that are impressive, but they're still living in Chiang Mai. There's just not a lot going on up there. Maybe if you had something nice on the water in Phuket you could have a good life. But that's not something most non-wealthy or non-retired people will be looking at.<p>I like living here because although my condo costs a significant percentage of what I paid in SF, it's also 3x bigger. Cars are a lot more expensive but they also hold their resale value much better than in the US. I also never have to cook a meal, wash my car or clean my place. That means I can spend 100% of my time working if I choose to. The value of that can't be stressed enough if you're an obsessive workaholic (like I would imagine a lot of people here are).<p>Compared to the US, having access to good, low cost health and dental is also great.

3875656,comment,3874324,3874800,16,0,granitepail,,,"For those of you who don't know, weavejester is the creator and maintainer of a few of the more prominent (and, in my opinion, production ready) clojure libraries (thanks!), mostly centered around web serving.  His code is concise and chunked into many small functions, abstracting out as much functionality as is possible -- this is the lisp way.<p>If you've written much clojure (or any other lisp, really) you likely realize that writing massive functions is not a part of the lisp paradigm, and for good reason -- not only are large functions tough to read, but the notion of everything being a function makes it natural to build what are essentially nested function calls into more abstract functional representations.<p>I understand why Chris has mentioned support for other languages (raising money + support), but anyone who approaches this project should really keep in mind the fact that it is being built with Clojure in mind.  I'm sure that, should it be funded and seen to completion, Light Table will provide a rich experience for other languages, but what is most exciting about this project is its potential to truly cater to the needs of a functional programmer.  As he correctly states in his introduction, functions are the most often used ""block"" in functional programming, and editors/IDE's should reflect that and I am hoping Light Table manages to do this.<p>Regarding the criticism of live code evaluation, I see it as a bit absurd.  It should be obvious that the main goal of such an interaction with one's code is not to test functions on live inputs.  I see this being most useful in scenarios where the programmer wishes to, say, process strings read in through a socket.

The missing piece of the puzzle here is that currently most people view databases as a single correct representation of the world, and assume that whether you have an acid database or a nosql solution, all transactions must eventually be reconciled, and a single truth must emerge.  This is patently false.\nIn actuality, database systems will begin to resemble distributed version control systems very closely over the next five to eight years, until they are almost indistinguishable.  The two will meet in the middle as all distributed revision control systems end up using off the shelf graph database systems, and these graph database systems incorporate additional functionality to support one them.  At some point most editors will be capable of speaking directly to the database systems without file intermediates, and if we need to transmit program data from one place to another, it will be via cloning/replication, or a textual dump and restore in some (rare) circumstances.\nMake no mistake about it, the key-value and column based architecture of current nosql solutions is going to transition to graph databases in the not to distant future - the algorithms to make efficient use of graph databases aren't <i>quite</i> there yet but it is getting very close.  The idea of a single consistent world view is going to shift to various contexts and sub-contexts where consistency need not hold throughout the hierarchy (exactly in the manner of forks and branches).  We will share data by establishing contextual nesting and hierarchies of information primacy.<p>Files are an artifact of early computing architecture, and holding on to them beyond their useful lifetime will only anchor us.",1335119023

WP7 is currently at 2 million+ devices, which is pretty extensive but there is less competition than there would be on Android as there are fewer apps. As a result, the uptake on people buying your software might be higher in WP than on Android (a gut guess, I must admit, but it's what's prompted me to write the article).<p>I don't think Google will drop Android completely but I think that the fragmentation will get worse. For example, I'd develop for the Kindle Fire version of Android before others. Why? Because monetization in the Kindle app store seems to work better (there was an article on HN about this a few weeks back).<p>I agree with your last line and that's where the Motorola acquisition is puzzling. It strikes me that HTC, Samsung and others may start looking at WP as an alternative now that Motorola is owned by Google. If Nokia shows sign of strength (and early indications point that the Lumia 900 is heading in the right direction), others might follow... and THAT is an issue for Android.",1335118843

If you don't do that you\nprobably won't find this very interesting.  Sorry!  Maybe you could read Text\nfrom Dog if you haven't seen it already?  Either way, have a nice\nmorning/afternoon/evening!<p>The Situation\n-------------<p>Every time I get a new computer, I go through the same song and dance:<p>1. Look at what programs and packages I have installed on the old computer.\n2. Install these programs on the new computer.\n3. Copy over my configuration files from the old computer to the new one.\n4. Spend the rest of my day fixing all the things that broke because I'm using\n   a newer version of program X.<p>Step 4 is always the most painful part of getting a new machine.  Always.<p>Without fail I spend several hours tweaking configuration files, adjusting my\nworkflow, and so on because I've upgraded to a new version of foo which doesn't\nsupport option X any more or requires library Y version N+1 now.<p>Getting a new computer should be a <i>pleasant</i> experience!  The unboxing from the\nsleek packaging, that ""new laptop"" smell, the nostalgia of the default desktop\nimage.  Why does this horrible step 4 have to exist and how can we get rid of\nit?<p>The Divide\n----------<p>I've noticed something interesting lately: I can categorize almost <i>all</i> of the\nsoftware I use into two distinct groups:<p>* Software that breaks pretty much <i>every</i> time I update it (e.g. weechat,\n offlineimap, Clojure, many Python packages, Skype).\n* Software that almost <i>never</i> breaks when I update it (e.g. Mercurial, git,\n tmux, Python, ack, zsh, Vim, Dropbox).<p>Software that falls in between these two extremes is surprisingly rare.  There\nseems to be a pretty clean divide between the two groups.<p>This makes me think that there's some special attribute or quality of the\nsecond group (or its authors) which the first one lacks.<p>Brokenness\n----------<p>I think it's important that I nail down what I mean by ""breaks"" or ""is broken"".\nI don't necessarily just mean the introduction of ""new bugs"".<p>When I say that a program ""breaks"", I mean:<p>* When I update from version X to version Y of a program, library, or language...\n* Without changing my configuration files, source code, etc...\n* The resulting combination doesn't work properly<p>In effect, I'm saying that ""breaking backwards compatibility"" means ""the program\nis broken""!<p>This may be a strong statement, but I stand by it in most cases.<p>Backwards compatibility matters!  Every time someone makes a backwards\nincompatible change in a program or library, they cost the world the following\namount of time:<p><pre><code>   Number of people          Time it takes each person\n   using that part of      X    to figure out what changed\n   the program                   and how to fix it\n</code></pre>\nOften this can be a significant amount of time!<p>The Process of Updating\n-----------------------<p>When pointing out a backwards incompatible change to someone, you'll often get\na response similar to this:<p><pre><code>   ""Well, I mentioned that backwards incompatibility in the changelog, so what\n   the hell, man!""\n</code></pre>\nThis is not a satisfactory answer.<p>When I'm updating a piece of software there's a good chance it's not because I'm\nspecifically updating <i>that program</i>.  I might be:<p>* Moving to a new computer.\n* Running a ""$PACKAGE_MANAGER update"" command.\n* Moving a website to a bigger VPS and reinstalling all the libraries.<p>In those cases (and many others) I'm not reading the release notes for\na specific program or library.  I'm not going to find out about the brokenness\nuntil I try to use the program the next time.<p>If I'm lucky the program will have a ""this feature is now deprecated, read the\ndocs"" error message.  That's still a pain, but at least it's less confusing than\njust getting a traceback, or worst of all: silently changing the behavior of\na feature.<p>Progress\n--------<p>I completely understand that when moving <i>backwards</i> to an older version\nI should expect problems.  The older version hasn't had the benefit of the extra\nwork done on the new version, so of course it should be less stable.<p>But when I'm <i>updating</i> to a higher version number the software should be\n<i>better</i> and <i>more stable</i>!  It has had more work done on it, and I assume no\none is actively trying to make software worse, so why does something that\npreviously worked no longer work?<p>We're supposed to be making <i>progress</i> as we move forward.  The software has had\n<i>more</i> work done on it, why does it not function correctly <i>now</i> when it\nfunctioned correctly <i>before</i>?<p>Yes, this means developers will need to add extra code to handle old\ninput/configuration.  Yes, this is a pain in the ass, but <i>the entire point of\nmost software is to save people time by automating things</i>.  Again, every\nbackwards-incompatible change costs the world an amount of time:<p><pre><code>   Number of people         Time it takes each person\n   using that part of     X      to figure out what changed\n   the program                  and how to fix it\n</code></pre>\nIf our goal is to <i>save time</i> then we should not make changes that <i>cost time</i>.\nOr at least we should not make such changes lightly.<p>A Culture of Sadness\n--------------------<p>Proof that this is a real issue can be found in the tools we use every day.  As\nprogrammers we've invented elaborate dependency systems to deal with it.<p>We say ""pip install django==1.3"" or put ""[clojure ""1.2""]"" in our Leiningen\nproject.clj files to avoid using the newest versions because they'll break.<p>Step back and look at this for a second.<p>What the hell?<p>What the <i>hell</i>?<p>We have invented software with features designed to help us use <i>old</i> versions\nof other software!<p>We have <i>written code</i> to <i>avoid</i> using the ""latest and greatest"" software!<p>Obviously this is not entirely bad, but the fact that manually specifying\nversion numbers to avoid running <i>newer</i> code is commonplace, expected, and\na ""best practice"" horrifies me.<p>I would <i>love</i> to be able to say something like this in my requirements.txt and\nproject.clj files:<p><pre><code>   Of *course* I want the latest version of library X!  I want *all* the\n   newest bug fixes and improvements!\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately I can't do that right now because so many projects make backwards\nincompatible changes all the time.<p>The moment I try to build the project at some point in the future I'll be sent\non a wild goose chase to figure out what function moved into what other\nnamespace and what other function was split into its own library and dammit the\ndocumentation on the project's website is autogenerated from the tip of its git\nrepo and so it doesn't apply to the latest actual version and jesus christ\nI think I'll just quit programming and teach dance full time instead even though\nI'll go hungry.<p>The Tradeoff\n------------<p>One could argue that sometimes backwards incompatible changes cost time up front\nbut save time in the long run by making the software more ""elegant"" and ""lean"".<p>While I'm sure there are cases where this is true, I feel like it's a cop out\nmost of the time.  Allow me to illustrate this with a helpful Venn diagram:<p><pre><code>                                   -------\n                                  /3333333\\n                                 |333333333|\n                                  \3333333/\n                                   -------\n\n   11 -> People who give a shit what a program's codebase\n   11    looks like.\n\n   22 -> The authors of said program.\n   22\n</code></pre>\nFor libraries where the author is the only user, none of this rant applies.\nYou're free!  Break as much as you like!<p>For the majority of libraries, however, there are probably vastly more ""users""\nthan ""authors"".  Saving a few hours of the authors' own time has to be weighed\nagainst the 10 minutes each that the hundreds of users will have to spend\nfiguring out what happened and working around it.<p>I want to be clear: being backwards compatible <i>doesn't</i> mean sacrificing new\nfeatures!  New features can still be added!  Refactoring can still happen!<p>In most cases keeping backwards compatibility simply means maintaining a bit of\nwrapper code to support people using the previous version.<p>For example: in Python, if we moved the public foo() function to a new module,\nwe'd put the following line in the original module:<p><pre><code>   from newmodule import new_foo as foo\n</code></pre>\nIs it pretty?  Hell no!  But this single line of code will probably save more\npeople more time than most of the other lines in the project!<p>This may just be an artifact of how my brain is wired, but I actually get\na sense of satisfaction from writing code that bridges the gap between older\nversions and new.<p>I can almost hear a little voice in my head saying:<p><pre><code>   ""Mwahaha, I'll slip this refactoring past them and they'll never even know\n   it happened!""\n</code></pre>\nMaybe it's just me, but I think that ""glue"" code can be clever and beautiful in\nits own right.<p>It may not bring a smile to anyone's face like a shiny new feature, but it\nprevents many frowns instead, and preventing a frown makes the world a happier\nplace just as much as creating a smile!<p>Exceptions\n----------<p>One case where I feel the backwards incompatibility tradeoff <i>is</i> worth it is\nsecurity.<p>A good example of this is Django's change which made AJAX requests no longer be\nexempt from CSRF checks.  It was backwards incompatible and I'm sure it broke\nsome people's projects, but I think it was the right thing to do because it\nimproved security.<p>I also think it's unreasonable to expect all software to be perfectly ready from\nits first day.<p>Sometimes software needs to get poked and prodded in the real world before it's\nfully baked, and until then requiring strict backwards compatibility will do\nmore harm than good.<p>By all means, backwards compatibility should be thrown to the wind in the first\nstage of a project's life.  At the beginning it needs to find its legs, like\na baby gazelle on the Serengeti.  But at some point the project needs to get its\nbalance, grow up, and start concerning itself with backwards compatibility.<p>But when should that happen?<p>A Solution\n----------<p>I think there's a simple, intuitive way to mark the transition of a piece of\nsoftware from ""volatile"" to ""stable"":<p><pre><code>   Version 1.0\n</code></pre>\nBefore version 1, software can change and evolve rapidly with no regards for\nbreaking, but once that first number becomes ""greater than or equal to 1"" it's\ntime to be a responsible member of the software community and start thinking\nabout the real humans whose time gets wasted for every breaking change.<p>This is the approach semantic versioning takes, and I think it's the right one.<p>I know a lot of people dislike semantic versioning.  They hate how requires\nincrementing the major version number every time a breaking change is made.<p>I consider it to be a <i>good</i> thing.<p>You <i>should</i> pause and carefully consider making a change that will break\npeople's current code.<p>You <i>should</i> be ashamed if your project is at version 43.0.0 because you've made\n42 breaking changes.  That's 43 times you've disregarded your users' time!\nThat's a bad thing!<p>As programmers we need to start caring about the people we write software for.<p>Before making a change that's going to cause other people pain, we should ask\nourselves if it's really worth the cost.  Sometimes it is, but many times it's\nnot, and we can wrap the change up so it doesn't hurt anyone.<p>So please, before you make that backwards incompatible change, think of the\nother human beings who are going to smack their monitors when your software\nbreaks.<p>Further Reading\n---------------<p>I'm certainly not the only person to notice this problem.  Many smarter people\nthan me have talked about it.  If you want to read more you might want to look\nup some or all of the following (Google is your friend):<p>* The Semantic Versioning spec (the specific numbering details don't matter as\n much as the philosophy).\n* Anything Matt Mackall has written on the Mercurial mailing list (especially\n the mails where he sounds especially grouchy).\n* Anything about ""software rot"" or ""code rot"".",1335117701

From your post, I doubt you'd claim to be technical when talking to a potential co-founder. Perhaps he didn't do a good job of directing his [shared (see the comments)] frustrations.<p>Also, I can assure you that tossing unfamiliar (foreign to your opponent's discipline) terminology over the fence, is not a game you want to play with an engineer of any sort :)",1335117665

3875534,comment,3875103,3875103,6,0,adahm,,,"Have to say, I feel like being a ""non-coder"" is becoming shorthand for calling someone second class in this tech startup ecosphere. As someone with lots to bring to the table, especially domain expertise, business acumen, marketing, design, etc etc. I always feel a bit on the outside looking in. I have started to learn to code but more so to become conversational with hackers/programmers/coders. I'll never be that good though, I know that. I might be able to get to the point where I can hack together a prototype or speak to someone like a conversational Spanish speaker speaks to a native Spanish speaker. But will that be good enough?<p>I feel like the point that needs to be made here is that EVERYONE has something to bring to the table. Everyone is good at something and on a TEAM, that's what matters. Sure  a team of amazing coders can make something great, but a great product does not a great business make. Sometimes, ie PayPal and others, all coders create a hugely successful business. But Zuckerberg is not a great entrepreneur because he's a great coder. He's a great entrepreneur who happens to be able to code. So instead of worshipping at the alters of coders, and I have TONS of respect for what you guys can do, we need to acknowledge that a successful STARTUP is more than code. So much more. Its about assembling the right team with the right combination of skills. Coding is one of them sure, but to say its the only one and labeling someone who doesn't as ""non-technical"" like its a bad thing, negates the notion that a business runs on more than just what can be hacked together. If a car were just an engine, we'd still be driving model-Ts. What makes something beautiful, what makes it successful, what makes it sell for 1 billion dollars is the specific combination of skills and how they work in chorus to solve a need better than anyone else. And those skills are varied, complex, and come from a lot of different areas.",1335117604

666333,comment,666096,666306,0,0,lsc,,,"'people skills' are highly dependent on what people you wish to get along with.    the 'socially skilled' marketing guy with good hair? ever notice how the more technical people on your team want to murder that guy?    Many of us prefer to hang out with people who stare at their shoes while explaining what a forrier transform is over that asshole with the good hair who is talking about how cool his yoga weekend was (or whatever the cool people are doing these days)<p>So yeah, while you want people who are socially compatible to work together, keep in mind that managers and technical people have very different preferences when it comes to choosing friends.",1245494682

If you're excited about what you do, initiating that excitement in someone new is very rewarding. I suspect that's what happened in the jewellery store.<p>And that goes both ways: nothing is more annoying than a clerk who doesn't know anything, and even gets the information on the label wrong.",1245494582

And competitors too, but in a different, probably evil, way.<p>His health worries me too - and I am neither a heavy Apple user nor a shareholder, but I am deeply concerned about innovation in this market if he ever retires. Who would lead? Microsoft? Ewww.<p>And there is also the human factor. I wish him well for no other reason than him being a human being.",1245494512

There was a handshake and part of the request is sent, but does Apache see that as a connection? I think not.</i><p>You're confusing this with a SYN flood, which works at the IP level, not the userspace level, and for which a connection limit in user space would indeed be ineffective.<p>In this attack, data is already transmitted, but it is incomplete, so the server can't act upon the request, and apache does hold that connection.<p>More info/discussion to the attack here:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=665741"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=665741</a>",1245492659

I was very excited and I emailed all my friends ""Hey look this is great!""  Then I slowly realized over the course of the week that I had been duped.  I received no further response and was embarrassed.  It should have been obvious with the spelling mistakes and the woman being listed as a High School English teacher :)  I'm moving to offline approaches.  I should get out more any ways.  I may try okcupid or something in the future.",1245492021
666310,comment,665705,665705,0,0,tempest67,,,"Hrm.  This doesn't ring true to me; in fact, it seems almost more like a guy bragging about his victories than a helpful message about failure.  It isn't true that every door closing is met with another one opening; nor is it true that every failure happens ""for a reason.""  Sometimes failure is brutal, nasty, and not helpful.  The real message about failure to remember is Theodore Roosevelt's:  Yes, you might fail (and you will, for ""there is no effort without error""), but the credit and honor is yours nevertheless, because you didn't hang back -- you got out there and gave it your all.<p>EDIT: (For anyone who might not know the T.R. quote, it's taken from his Sorbonne speech (in red on this page): <a href=""http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trsorbonnespeech.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trsorbonnespeech.html</a>)",1245492004

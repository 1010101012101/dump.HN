I was making around 70k base in my previous job in Austin, and this is definitely a more profitable and established company. How much should I be asking for? I&#x27;m currently asking for 100k base. Is that reasonable?<p>I&#x27;ve lived in Austin for a year, and definitely its not super cheap. Just living base expenses come to $2000 per month, not including any splurging on electronics or travel. 70k was just about ok for me: I saved 20k of it, but I definetly want to save more and not have to think about whether I should buy a coffee everyday or not.<p>Anyways, what I&#x27;m trying to ask is: can you please advise me on what Salaries are reasonable to expect? I think I would be pretty happy with 100k in Austin. Is that too less or too much? Any inputs would be greatly appreciated :)<p>Thanks everyone! I love you guys.<p>edit1: A little bit about my background... The position I&#x27;m looking at is more of a backend-heavy but fullstack developer position requiring expertise in Python. No, not Django, but more OpenStack kind of applications. I graduated with a MS in computer Science from a top 10 univ for CS in US, I&#x27;ve had 1 year work experience with Python, but I&#x27;ve been using Python since college.

They are happy they made something, and they don&#x27;t need to be told that they&#x27;re doing it wrong, because their goals were internal and self-set from the beginning. But the whole premise of the artist even trying to speak to an audience is to decide what is important to say, what is necessary and what is unnecessary - both what the audience will like, and what is good for them to like. And so artists who are aiming not just to say anything, but to say the &quot;best&quot; things possible, eventually gravitate towards a critical lens.<p>Critique is a discussion that is semi-private: It takes place between the critic and the artist, and not the audience as a whole. Audience members have the final decision in that they can walk away from the resulting discourse, but this doesn&#x27;t mean that they need to intervene and announce which things should or should not be open for critique. When the audience does intervene directly in criticism, it generally amounts to bullying of either the critic or the artist, or sometimes both; it&#x27;s not productive.<p>Where this dialogue becomes messy is when the space of discussion has not been agreed upon: Should this discussion aim for criticism or not? If &quot;no,&quot; simply say you&#x27;re thinking that. But if you&#x27;re presenting an argument to avoid criticism as a means of shutting down a criticism, you&#x27;re being a bully.",1411160052

In fact, it&#x27;s very likely that this is a second-best solution. For example, imagine there&#x27;s an early frenzy in solar panels, companies way, <i>way</i> over-manufacture them. As they go out of business and are liquidated, the sell-off of the massive panel surplus below-cost causes significant adoption of this early solar panel technology.<p>A huge fraction of people now have solar panels on their roof, but now there&#x27;s no longer a business incentive for <i>sustainable</i> production of solar panels (i.e. advancements in some technology that would make them cost-effective), because the market is now saturated. Additionally, these solar panels may well be displacing other next-generation energy technologies because of the artificially low price, even if there is no advancement that would make solar power cost-effective on a reasonable time scale. On net, humanity had to pay the full price for all those solar panels, and once they exist we&#x27;re better off using them than not, but it&#x27;s not necessarily true that because we have them and they are in use, we&#x27;re better off than we would be if they had never been created in the first place.<p>EDIT: I should clarify that I&#x27;m not sure that <i>under</i> investment is any better - the right amount of investment is a knowledge problem that we generally solve iteratively with feedback from the profit-loss system. It&#x27;s just that just because you can reduce the total deadweight loss from over-investment doesn&#x27;t mean that over-investment is somehow a good thing.",1411159954

Until then, &quot;open source&quot; is purely a compositional compound noun in the English language that is understood by combining the meanings of &quot;open&quot; and &quot;source&quot;.  Open doesn&#x27;t say anything about non-proprietary.

If you &quot;open up&quot; to someone, you aren&#x27;t publicizing your life to the whole world.  If all the users of a program have the source code, or easy access to it, that source is open. If he program is proprietary, then perhaps some of those who have the source code are unlicensed users. They still have the source code, and it is still effectively &quot;open source&quot; to them too.<p>And in the context of some programming language that has no binary code, would you even continue to use the term &quot;open source&quot; and &quot;closed source&quot;?

This is not the same as censorship.<p>When a large part of society condemns something for whatever reason, or if a certain segment wishes to use their arguments to try convince enough people that something should be condemned, this is a natural, largely unpredictable, and unrelenting process that happens all the time to reflect shifting social values and morals.

The crazier and zanier the better. Were there awards for &#x27;Most likely to actually be random words&#x27;, those are my favorites.<p>Also, I just started in neuroscience from an EE/Physics background. You would be AMAZED at what gets published. The rigor of physics is just.... incomprehensible in bio. Granted, yes, the experiments are &#x27;squishy&#x27; and hard to quantify. You run a gel, and you get signal or not, counting it hard enough as is, let alone trying to measure anything. Still, the papers we read.... It&#x27;s like they tried to do math, but gave up halfway through. I&#x27;ve seen papers where they start out with 2 decimal accuracy and errorbars in Figure 1, drop the errors completely in figure 2, and then just go to counting by 10s in Figure 4. Somehow, they derive significant results that journals will publish with only 20 cells or something. Mind you, nowhere do they quote the temperature, the pressure, what their saline solution actually is, how many failure experiments they ran, etc. The physicist in me is just ... pain. And oh god, the egos. Papers will have just one author on them, the PI, and when you look at the webpage, 20 faces show up for the postdocs alone in that lab.

8342266,comment,8339263,8339263,4,0,astockwell,,,"Speaking purely to the experiences of building a new software product, I&#x27;ve seen this exact story play out countless times. Everyone (except maybe the engineers themselves) seems to think that designing a software product is part of the &quot;planning phase&quot;, and thus should happen before any time is &quot;wasted&quot; on development:<p>> &quot;That product planning led to an immense series of wireframes and comps (visual designs of what the product would look like and how it would function) that numbered into the hundreds of screens...&quot;<p>The biggest contributor to this I&#x27;ve seen is the dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of small ways that a design (done in a vacuum, without simultaneous prototyping) will differ from established development patterns, frameworks, and other pre-packaged solutions that engineers use daily to avoid reinventing every wheel. And engineers respond with timelines that <i>expect</i> to be able to leverage those frameworks. Thus the dissonance begins.<p>One example: a design calls for a form to be broken across 4 pages. There may be great aesthetic rationale or even user testing to support this, but that means that in all likelyhood any framework (e.g. Rails/Flask/Play/etc, not to mention native apps) will have to have additional modification to support sessions, changes to validation, changes to the auth domain, persistence changes, etc. And it&#x27;s <i>not necessary</i> for an MVP. And many times these differences are much more subtle and deeply entrenched, and would require rethinking much of the wireframes/designs to align with development patterns. /rant<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the answer is here, except maybe that this is one more point in favor of having a &quot;technical founder&quot; or in general a technical person with decision-making authority, to avoid going down a road without proofing out your ideas or timelines.",1411157703

8342230,comment,8341939,8341939,5,0,niuzeta,,,"<i>In my opinion</i>,<p>Nero was dubbed tyrant because the <i>media</i> at the time - that is, senators who could write <i>and</i> publish disliked him. The dislike is understandable for his execution of Seneca; one of them. Tacitus hated him to guts and later Christian history dubbed him as the worst tyrant. The infamous Damnatio Memoriae(the worst possible punishment to a public figure at the time; erasing all evidence of the person&#x27;s accomplishments) was held against him as well.<p>But if you think about it, He never <i>really</i> messed up as a role of Princeps. In short, Augustus&#x27; princeps were given two responsibilities: national security(as an Emperotor) and food supply(As a &#x27;Caesar Augustus&#x27; and &#x27;Princeps&#x27;). Food supply was pretty much guaranteed in his tenure, apart for one turbulent season.<p>For national security, many give Corbulo the credit to resolve the conflict with Patria(i.e., letting Patrian prince take throne of Armellian, but have Roman authority give ceremony). While it was a drastic change in Roman politics, Nero was the one to give the final say. He was unstable, but he wasn&#x27;t stupid.<p>All northern defence lines were peaceful(i.e., didn&#x27;t have a major breach) and conquest for Caledonia(Britain) was ongoing. When Judea revolt came about, he sent possibly the best card against that(Vespianus, who later wins the civil war after Nero&#x27;s demise).<p>His demise was a complex one; he lost respect from populus due to his murder of Octavia and his mother(authority), and support from senators(justification to power), and finally, from the armies(military power) all at the same time.<p>Compared to mediaval then later post-Renaissance divine rights, Roman emperors&#x27; powers were far more justified, and consequently, liable to be checked.",1411157361

8342210,comment,8341017,8341017,0,0,lnanek2,,,"Doesn&#x27;t seem like a very fair or intelligent article. It basically says Uber is doing nothing good and just exploiting workers, but if I wrote an Uber clone app, no one would download it, or even hear about it. Then if someone did download it there would be only one or two drivers. Then if they traveled to another city and opened the app there would be no drivers at all.<p>We developers can often write an app that is technically competent, but then it never pulls in the users. In the case of Uber, they not just have a successful app and brand that people know and download, but the app also needs to have a large network of drivers in it to provide good service. The vast majority of drivers I&#x27;ve ever had gave me their personal business card, but I never use them since I&#x27;d have to call and negotiate a time and a price - and the price they start at is often more than just booking them through Uber or SuperShuttle or whatever.

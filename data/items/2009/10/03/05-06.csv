If the goal were about giving inventors a payday, they wouldn't be required to disclose their inventions to the public at all, they'd just be given ownership of the idea forever.  One could argue it was designed to help them both I guess, but when founding a nation, it's the nation and thus the public that you're looking out for.  Giving a payday to inventors just doesn't make sense as a goal, but it makes perfect sense as an incentive to achieve a large goal.",1254549591

So before leaving from home for work, I would have one goal - ""I need to get to work in 45 mins"", that's it, no more thought about anything else.<p>Once at work, I would have this short goal ""I need to check my mail in the next 30 mins"", then ""I need to work on this bug or feature for the next hour""... and so on.<p>This kept me on track without letting my mind get caught up in the problems, and become numb.<p>I also took 1 hour vacations... where I would go on an hour long drive to some nice place away from the city, and listen to music. It helped me refresh my spirits.<p>HTH.",1254549035

You can't just buy your plane ticket and show up, instead you have to fill out paperwork, fax copies of your passport around, etc.<p>(Personal story: I transited Shanghai a few weeks ago.  If I didn't need a visa to visit the city, I would have added a stopover or picked a longer connection so that I could go into town.  But since this would have involved money and paperwork, I decided to skip it.<p>I did get to see the Great Firewall in action, though, which was kind of neat.

858551,comment,857430,858459,0,0,vaksel,,,"i think it comes to the bottom line, all the ""causes"" don't really mean anything. It's always the same 10,000 people protesting environmentalism, darfur, G20, care bears. And even those, majority will come back to Google a week later when the ""boo Google"" protests get boring and they'll switch to ""boo Sponge Bob squarepants, a corrupt depiction of the scumbag capitalist anti-environmentalism""<p>The bottom line, is that Google doesn't want to lose a 1 billion person Chinese market over a bunch of hippies. Long term(20-30 years) it'll account for 70-80% of their revenue, turning the back on it now would be the dumbest thing for them to do.",1254547747

858543,comment,858510,858510,0,0,makecheck,,,"The <i>original</i> version of this strategy <i>is</i> sane, but it has to actually be followed.  And in every ""implementation"" I have seen, it was not.<p>The critical part of this strategy is continuous improvement: to <i>not only</i> rank existing employees and lay off some, but to <i>hire new ones</i>.  The NET should be no real change in numbers, but an increase in overall quality.<p>But guess what.  Companies invariably failed to do the 2nd, and simply used this as a nifty new way to decide layoffs, during a hiring freeze.  The result is predictable: a productivity and morale drain.  What did they <i>think</i> was going to happen, that making teams smaller would magically make the remaining people more productive?  Let's see: of the people left, the ones who then seem ""relatively"" productive are just those that didn't lose as many team members; there is no further indicator of who is actually most valuable.  But that didn't mean that layoffs stopped: no, the next rounds simply started cutting to the bone.",1254547070

It's actually fairly rare to run across a single threaded application anymore.

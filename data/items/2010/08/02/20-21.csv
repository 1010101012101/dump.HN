1569045,comment,1566278,1568411,0,0,lelele,,,"> ""Can't"" is not at issue here - with enough effort, anyone can do just about anything. The question is whether it's actually worth the effort.<p>Perhaps I should have said ""with little effort"", then. If you can't setup a system with just little effort, you are not skilled enough as a programmer. See, Ewjordan, I understand your frustration. I've had my share with setting up ""newbie-hostile"" systems, and you know what? As a consequence, I now understand better how things work, and I can setup whatever system faster. I have ""graduated"" from Ubuntu to Debian user, I now use Emacs as my only editor, and so on. Little improvements... Still learning. Oh, and I'm faster at tracking down and fix issues which I or my coworkers stumble upon.<p>> A smart programmer will pick whichever one gets up and running the quickest so that he can actually see what coding is like in that language, as opposed to configuring/installing/compiling sources/tracking down a supported version/etc.<p>Would we really call her a smart programmer? A street-wise programmer maybe. Being such a programmer could be your goal? That's fine. Have fun and make a lot of money. I think a really smart programmer will pick the language which will pay more dividends in the long run. Kind of choosing a Vim clone over a regular editor.<p>> Why waste time doing all that stuff when if you just hop to the next language over you can have it all for free?<p>Because not all language are created equal and you sometime have to choose between fighting the system in the beginning and fighting the language in the long run.<p>Of course, you'll have an hear for practical considerations too. For instance, I'm currently learning Common Lisp over Scheme because even if I like Scheme better, CL has a wider user base and a proven track record.<p>> But then again, I've never gotten the sense that the CL folks actually want more people using it<p>I agree. Most of them don't seem interested. And I think I understand why. CLers are an old community and a lot of newbies jumped in, whined about things not working and left. Their hears are full. However, if you ask for help and ask for it smartly, you'll get answers, you'll - you won't believe this! - you'll get even code written for you.<p>P.S.: Sorry, but I don't have time to review this post.

But I've also become a fair to middling C programmer, and the strength I bring to that task has a much to do with knowing how to build large systems in a comprehensible way from the elements the language exposes, as it does to a basic knowledge of those elements. I.e. knowing how to code a case statement isn't the same as building a 50x400 state machine that's efficient, robust and debuggable.<p>I suspect the same is true of the skills and knowledge held by an experienced C++ hacker.<p>So I suspect that the C++ FAQ, and the Sutter book are just the ticket.<p>thanks<p>c",1280782343

I think that's a Rolex Submariner in the article, well once upon a time, if you were a diver, that was just a part of your gear, like your depth gauge. The Royal Navy even issued Rolexes to enlisted men. It was never meant to be a status symbol. If you were an airline pilot, you got a Rolex GMT Master with your epaulettes.<p>The radical shift in markets came about because the Swiss traditional watchmakers couldn't compete with mass-produced Japanese quartz (despite the quartz movement being invented in Switzerland). But with the exception of those encrusted with bling, expensive watches all need to have provenance to be sellable. Rolex with their Submariner, Omega with their Speedmaster (still NASA's standard-issue watch, BTW), and so on. That's what authenticity is here - a link to the past - selling traditional values to people who've grown up in a society where everything is disposable.<p>But don't ever wear a Panerai.",1280782051

Unless you can get write-ups in wedding magazines (in my experience they should give you a wedding magazine when you buy the engagement ring because that is the first thing the girl buys after the proposal!) then you are going to struggle to get people to part with money without some level of trial, but 7 days might be enough.<p>Then a charging structure based on a wedding might be best, $50 for a wedding (especially if you can demonstrate the ability to save time or money) would seem very reasonable. Personally too much more would seem a bit steep but I might just be tight. Monthly would obviously seem better as a revenue generator, but doesn't feel right to me - this is supposed to be a once off event - even if it is the third time!<p>Some thoughts on site: \n1. On Signup ""Who are you"" default who you are should be Bride. You may also want to include Mother of Bride in the list.\n2. Timezone - why?\n3. When - using US Date. Huge market for this outside of US. Either work out dates from browswer or dd-MMM-yyyy. UK market you'd have to make some changes as they divide wedding into 3 parts (church/ceremony, food, dancing) but it would still be useful as is.\n4. Expenses - no total\n5. Expenses - possibly you want a flag for provisional and actual - catering supposed to be 50 a guest x 100. 90 guests confirm so actually only 4500 and probably confirmed a few weeks before date\n6. Guests - nice flow,liked that you didn't have to enter too many details, because I wouldn't enter much.

1569001,comment,1568282,1568717,0,0,Locke1689,,,"<i>In fact, my personal prescription for where we are right now is for a significant return of power to the states. Some things have to be national-scale policy, but the list is much shorter than you think. We don't need a national-scale health care plan. Many of our states are larger than European countries that manage. State plans already exist. We don't need national agreement on any given social issue. If we weren't centralizing all our power, we wouldn't have to spend so much time arguing what the central policy should be.</i><p>I think you actually underestimate the complexities here. The problem isn't number of people -- you're correct, many states are as large as European countries. However, the states don't have nearly as much self-governing power (as granted by the Constitution) as European countries. In things like healthcare, this makes a big difference. For example, one of the biggest benefits to the federal government is that it can temporarily run a budget deficit during hard times. There are innumerable times (including now) when that would be necessary for a large swath of public services. It would require a rather huge change in federal law in order to make this work on the state level. Another problem you would get is massive problems with the full-faith-and-credit clause. All in all, it may be worth considering that, accounting for modern high-speed transportation and intercommunication and trade, strong states may be an antiquated idea.<p><i>Right now, for better or worse, our government is more liberal than our population</i><p>That's difficult to argue.

However, for a problem which is bounded in difficulty (such that a normal job applicant willing to put 2 hours into the interview could answer everything), being able to solve the problem in 24h vs. 2h is not really a good thing.<p>2) It's a lot harder to ""cheat"" on a realtime exam, especially on video.   The purpose of the interview is to evaluate a candidate, and it's unlikely that candidate's much smarter (or paid) friend would be part of the long-term package, but it's entirely possible someone could be getting assistance during the interview.  (it's basically like when a law or consulting firm sends a partner to win the business, and then has summer associates doing the actual work once they're engaged...)<p>Assuming remote-interview-only, this would be a problem.  Also, I view in-person interviews as fundamentally somewhat random.  If you really like a candidate on paper (or on video), and he shows up and is close but not necessarily 100%, a lot of interviewers are willing to explain away problems as ""he was nervous"" or ""having a bad day"".  Once an interviewer emotionally bonds with a candidate, it's a lot harder to be objective -- this is why I like to do early-stage objective/automatic screenings to determine basic competence.",1280780729

I'd love to hear your opinions.<p>I'm the single founder for Marrily, and today is the result of an intense 3 months of me bootstrapping and developing the app in a cave then finally come out to see the sunlight, and shouting from the top of my lungs that Yes, Marrily is out!<p>Marrily is a word I came up with, it means to ""Marry Happily."" I wanted to help people getting married easier and less stressed, and the existing sites aren't all that great (I'll write more about this later in Marrily's blog.)  Even though the real development took 3 months, it actually has been 3 years since when I came up with the idea and actually built and release the app.  If I'm to learn something from releasing Marrily, it's probably perseverance and grit.<p>I decide that when I launch Marrily officially, it will be a premium app (e.g. pay-to-play, as apposed to freemium).  The reason why is I believe that if I build a solid app that is useful and easy to use, and can potentially save people a lot of time and efforts, then it's fair to charge a small fee.  With the freemium model, it's harder to code (limiting features in code can make things a lot more complicated) and can affect negatively the revenue (if the free one is so good that it doesn't make sense to upgrade).  But I welcome your ideas and suggestions.<p>However, there's no subscription mechanism in the alpha release (I stil have not implemented any of the subscription handling code yet!).  I estimate that it will take a few more weeks to finalize the app and have everything in place for the official launch.<p>Since you're one of the first people to see the app in its entirety, I'd love to have your feedback as you use it.  More specifically, I'd like to know if you run into any issue navigating the application, and if something does not make sense to you, I'd love to know.  I have tested as much as possible to make sure it is stable and ready for production use.  But being a single founder, it's sometimes a challenge to keep track of every changes in the application.<p>It's been an amazing journey, and a life-changing experience, so I'd like to share this moment with all of you, and many thanks to the HackerNews community for being so awesome.  I learned a lot about myself and entrepreneurship in the past few months, and I promise that I'll give back to the community to help more entrepreneurs fulfill their dreams.<p>Alex \nalexle@marrily.com",1280779901

1568848,comment,1568089,1568830,0,0,grad_student_,,,"Summary: do it if you want to become a career researcher, but if you want to do creative hacking than cut out the middleman and just do it. Gradschool is the hotbed of timewaste and procrastination so don't do it to get yourself focused. If anything, taking some undergrad courses in some topic that is new to you could be much more useful that way.<p>Even if you want to get into research, leave all ideals and preconceived notions behind. As others have said, doing a phd is depressing as hell. You will have smart people to hang out with every day, but especially if you are thinking of real world applicability of things, you might have a hard time connecting with most of them.",1280779370

I'd expect floats, faux columns, display: table-* , *-column-count being the answer but get some cleardiv/clearfix instead. I never liked those, especially cleardiv. Often you can do simply reusing next element (#footer {clear:both}), but sometimes that's not enough, alas.<p>In my opinion any competent frontend developer should know these, not enough for the hero. On the other hand, to be able to interview hero you should be at least on that level yourself, which is not the case there, imho.",1280779338

Rather, hedonic adjustments are a distortion of what's actually going on with respect to inflation, and that's what I have a problem with. There's no vast conspiracy here, just some fancy accounting. I may be mistaken, but there's no transparency in what the gov't considers a hedonic adjustment, which leads to data accuracy problems as well.<p>Hedonic adjustments basically say that a product price increase or decrease is weighted partially towards inflation and partially towards quality improvement and competition.<p>But what happens is that economists will say perceived inflation is overstated because less money is needed to buy an iPod. That's a problem.<p>Do note that this sort of adjustment is not a point of contention right now as we went through a recession, but back in 2007 when oil was skyrocketing and the price of milk was running, hedonic adjustments were used to understate actual inflation.<p>Keep in mind, I'm not an expert in this stuff and if you need more evidence, the google should help you.",1280779321

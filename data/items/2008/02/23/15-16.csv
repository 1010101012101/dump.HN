122049,comment,121890,122042,0,0,fiaz,,,"I'm sorry that you think I was subscribing to some sort of conspiracy theory in listing those organizations.  The point I was trying to make is that what has been termed ""fluff"" is now ""destructive trends"", and worse it was somehow suggested that by exposing others behaviors (or rather, revealing stats as illustrated in the above description) would somehow lead to a (final?) solution.<p>The degree to which the original ""problem"" is becoming viewed as cancerous is alarming because I feel that News.YC is a place for diverse thinking and sharing interesting content.  Digg/Reddit have devolved because they are more homogenous than they are diverse (hence the mob-like mentality).<p>The very diversity that makes an online community interesting should be embraced instead of eradicated, but that's just my opinion.  I know that eventually as News.YC becomes more popular this community will homogenize and follow the same fate as Digg/Reddit.<p>It is inevitable...",1203782007

122043,comment,121353,121353,0,0,dgabriel,,,"Look, I can bring this back around to start-ups!<p>At 21, in the heady late 90s, I was looking for a new web programming job.  I interviewed at two places, Monster and this weird little start-up company in a dilapidated house in Allston (neighborhood in Boston that attracts students and wanna-be rockers).  Monster was a commute, cubicles, and a growing name.  It seemed like a good prospect.<p>When I walked into the interview at the other company, I saw the team of 6 or so people at makeshift desks lining the living room, and next to every workstation was an ashtray and a bong.  I'm totally serious.  It smelled like a Grateful Dead show in the middle of an industrial smokestack.<p>And you know what?  I took the second job.  Because it seemed really fucking cool, and I was 21, and Monster was already looking a bit Office Space-y.<p>But yeah, smoking (not just the mj) seemed cool, and weird, and offbeat, and it made the group seem even more rebellious than it would have otherwise. And it turned out ok.  Some people got rich, some of us made a little money with options.<p>I have a great story about how we trashed a bus management rented to take us to Six Flags.  I think it took the president approximately 5 minutes to light a spleef, and we were all completely drunk by the time we made it to the park... at 10am.",1203780809

122035,comment,121985,121985,0,0,dgabriel,,,"Having had several jobs where stock options were a motivator, I have a little advice to offer:<p>Stock options are not a replacement for a competitive salary, unless the technical people are given substantial ownership.  So, for example, 1% of a company that could realistically reach a valuation of 2 million dollars is not enough. The risk is only worth it if the payoff will make up for and exceed any salary trade offs.<p>Be clear and realistic about the numbers.  Don't exaggerate,  please please please.<p>Options can make good bonuses, but only if the company is perceived as doing well.  If your employees don't feel connected to the company, they'll scoff and become actively de-motivated.",1203779794

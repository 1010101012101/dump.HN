1429108,comment,1429023,1429023,0,0,pierrefar,,,"All very excellent points, and I'd like to add one more: URL shorteners came into existence because of a need in the market. Removing this need will pretty much kill all shorteners. All articles on this topic I've seen miss this point entirely. They dive into why URL shorteners are bad but ignore why they're here, i.e. how they provide real benefits to their users.<p>Some history:<p>1. TinyURL was started because emails had a character limit per line (Campaign Monitor suggests 65 characters, but it's more than that: <a href=""http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/2075/update-recommended-width-for-t/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/2075/update-recomme...</a>).<p>2. When Twitter came along, there was a massive need to squeeze in a URL in a small space, and tinyurl.com is just too long. At the same time, 2-letter ccTLDs became very easily accessible to the average hacker, and the market exploded.<p>IMHO, this is all Twitter's fault. They should have seen the massive usage of URL shorteners early on and created their own or changed the way the 140-char limit is calculated. t.co is coming late, but better late than never.<p>The final need in the market is analytics. Social media link sharing is mostly about creating a link on a website you don't own (like Twitter) that points to another website you don't own (like google.com or nytimes.com or the BBC). How do you know if anyone cared?<p>My hope for t.co is that it will have real-time <i>good</i> analytics built in to help marketers. Otherwise, they'll all keep using bit.ly or Cligs or home-grown shorteners. This is a genuine need that won't go away for now.<p>My point is simple: if you don't like URL shorteners, don't just bash them but fix the underlying cause instead.<p>Disclosure: I built Cligs and sold it late last year.",1276499941

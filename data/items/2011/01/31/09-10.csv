2160861,comment,2160744,2160813,0,0,_delirium,,,"In Denmark the currently-being-phased-in solution is a low-tech version of two-factor authentication. Instead of a hardware dongle, the centrally-administered ""NemID"" system issues you with a physical code card with some numerical codes on it. You enter your NemID password, your CPR number (Denmark's citizen-ID number), and the next unused code on the card. When there's fewer than 20 unused codes, the system notices and mails you a new card.<p>The downside is that there's now a single point of failure, albeit with more factors. If you get someone's CPR number, their NemID password, and their current NemID card with some indication on it of which the next unused code is (most people mark off the used codes), you can log into everything: all Danish banks, the tax authority, the municipal authorities, your library account, etc., etc.<p>They do try to minimize it by writing strongly worded warnings everywhere not to store your NemID password in your wallet.

Examples include optimization (e.g., linear programming), statistics (random variables, distributions, expectation, variance, independence, central limit theorem, law of large numbers, conditioning, hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, the general linear model), an overview of information systems (likely not worthwhile for readers of Hacker News!), accounting, mathematics of finance (e.g., Black-Scholes), business law, organizational behavior.<p>(3) Professional Education.<p>I never wanted to be a college prof but, due to some strange circumstances, for a while was a prof in one of the better MBA programs.  I concentrated on optimization and computing.<p>Since I was in such a program, I wanted to try to do something useful.  So, I tried to offer <i>professional</i> education to the students.  But I learned that business schools are very much against being <i>professional</i>, say, like law or medicine.<p>Instead, business schools have <i>physics envy</i> and want the profs sitting alone in their little offices with the door and curtains closed and thinking up some business world version of Newton's second law F = ma or Einstein's E = mc^2.  So, they want <i>research</i>.<p>Of course, so far no business school prof has found anything like F = ma, but there are journals run by B-school profs where B-school profs can get whatever they do published.  The journals do have some value as examples of make-work, junk-think, busy-work, prof-scam!<p>Shockingly, the business schools very much discourage the profs from having significant contact with real business.<p>If medical education were like business education, then all the med school profs would be at best second rate experts in biochemistry doing third rate work on imaginary cures for imaginary diseases and would never see real patients, and no one would go to a hospital no matter how much they hurt.  Law schools?  The profs there would never see clients, file a legal case, or appear in a courtroom and would do statistical studies about whatever in legal cases pursued by others.  Gee, maybe they'd do <i>research</i> on the ratio of nouns to verbs in legal briefs!<p>Instead, in medical school, the students actually get a good start on medicine, that is, how to take sick people and make them well, and that utility totally blows away anything in an MBA program.<p>So, what happened?  In WWII, the US military concluded that research in physical science was crucial.  Then the top 24 or so US research universities got an offer they couldn't refuse:  Take big bucks from the US Federal Government as grants for research that is promising for US national security (eventually, or medical care) or cease to be a competitive research university.<p>Then the B-schools, somehow, got dragged into the same thing:  The profs needed no business accomplishments or experience, had no on-going contact with actual business, taught <i>theory</i> sometimes close to business but usually not, and did <i>research</i> that has little promise of utility in business or anything else for at least 100 years.<p>In simple terms, the business school profs commonly don't know enough about business to run a lemonade stand.<p>Far, far too close for comfort is the clip<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlVDGmjz7eM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlVDGmjz7eM</a><p>from a business school class in Dangerfield's <i>Back to School</i>.  The clip is perceptive on several points:<p>(A) The prof's idea is to set up a business ""from the ground"" up ""with a 30,000 square foot facility"" and an ""efficient administrative and executive structure"".  Uh, generally that's a lot of money spent and likely at risk before any revenue.  So, it is more common in practice to start small and, if successful, then grow.<p>(B) Dangerfield asks, ""What's the product?"".  The prof wants to say ""That is immaterial for the purposes of our discussion here"".  Well, maybe ""immaterial"" is okay from 100,000 feet up or when just talking with the general contractor, but anyone actually in business cares a lot about the product and would want to discuss it.  The prof makes a stab, ""tape recorders"" and from Dangerfield gets a big lesson, ""Are you kidding?  The Japs'll kill us on the labor costs.""  The lesson:  It's not trivial to think of a promising product.  Quite generally the ""product"" is from important up to crucial.  So, Dangerfield doesn't want to discuss spending big bucks without the product clearly in mind, and here he is correct.<p>(C) Dangerfield asks, ""Why build?  You're better off leasing at a buck and a quarter, a buck and a half, a square foot, save your down payment"".  One lesson here is that the prof is being too simplistic on the build/lease decision.  For a growing business, building is likely a monument to ignorance.  Another lesson is, Dangerfield has actual, current costs for leasing; in a real business of that scale, the CEO knows costs in fine detail.  The clip is accurate:  Commonly profs don't know real costs.  E.g., I ended up leading the college in buying some computing; from the work I'd done before being a prof I knew the current costs in good detail, and the other profs in <i>information systems</i> didn't.  For a student to toss out actual cost data in class can be embarrassing, intimidating, and infuriating for a prof!<p>(D) Of course the high point of the exchange is where Dangerfield interrupts and says, ""Oh, you left out a bunch of stuff."", and with contempt the prof responds, ""Oh, really.  Like what for instance?"".  So, Dangerfield rattles off several points of costs in the <i>real</i> world!  Could be very good to know!  The clip shows a student taking notes furiously; that's accurate:  Commonly the students really do want the real stuff.  Finally the line, ""How about Fantasy Land"" is on target and a hoot.<p>It's a well done clip and parody of B-school and indicates that the movie makers and much of the audience got the points quickly.<p>The profs are pursuing a scam and know it:  The smarter ones see how to game the system and do but are ashamed of all they do.  The still smarter ones leave for something else in academics or just for actual business.<p>Instead, for a much better model, business schools should become plainly professional and borrow from medicine.  If some problem in a real business in, say, <i>supply chain optimization</i> becomes important, then a B-school prof with such a problem should contact the campus applied mathematics, civil engineering, or operations research department much as a medical school prof might contact someone in biochemistry or cell biology.<p>A business school prof is someone who teaches students how to avoid the pitfalls in business they avoided by being business school profs.<p>(4) Business.<p>For someone who wants to start a business and make it successful, there are various directions:<p>There are the businesses common on Main Street, and likely the best way to learn such a business is to have a father who is successful in that business and learn from the father while working in the business.<p>There are businesses successful due to parts of <i>globalization</i>; some of these opportunities are too new to learn from a father, and how to learn is not clear.  Travel the world on a tramp steamer and spend a few days in each of 100 foreign ports?<p>And for readers of <i>Hacker News</i>, sure, software.<p>For such possibilities, I have a tough time seeing that an MBA would be worth the time, money, effort, or, especially, the opportunity costs.<p>So, instead of just cursing the darkness, what might B-schools do?<p>Well, as I said, borrow from medicine.  Or, health care is important:  Medical school teaches students how to deliver high quality health care; to do this, the profs need to be experts in health care and relevant parts of the human body, disease, and how they work.  This expertise was difficult to get and to confirm, formulate, and teach but is crucial.  The research, say, in biochemistry, is important but not nearly the same thing.<p>Well, business is important:  B-school should teach students how to do well in business; to do this, the profs need to be experts in business and how businesses work, the problems they encounter, and how to solve the problems and do well.  This expertise will be difficult to get, confirm, formulate, and teach but is crucial.  The research, say, in statistics is important but not nearly the same thing.",1296466115

I get your underlying criticism about lack of domain expertise, but case study analysis never devolves into ""single strategic question"" situations.  Usually, cases are just meant to exercise brains into trying to understand and analyze different situations and realize that the various tensions can actually be quite complex.  The methodology has its faults, but let's (edit: not) make it out to be less than what it is.  It helps people to get into the mindset necessary to make good managerial decisions in diverse situations.  The key difference between case studies and real life is that case studies hand all the information to you on a silver platter, while in real life, managers need to go digging hard both inside and outside the company for all the information necessary for good decisions.  Case studies never intend to cause managers to want to avoid listening to their employees, especially the ones who are domain experts.  Such instances reflect more on the manager's incompetence than it does on the case study methodology's inability to teach.<p>As well, there's something good to be said about being able to bring in outside perspectives to right sinking ships, thanks to not being chained to pervasive biases that may unknowingly be held by those who were ""insiders"" for a while.

Gerstner, Jr. as its new CEO. For the first time since 1914 IBM had recruited a leader from outside its ranks. Gerstner had been chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco for four years, and had previously spent 11 years as a top executive at American Express. Gerstner brought with him a customer-oriented sensibility and the strategic-thinking expertise that he had honed through years as a management consultant at McKinsey & Co.. Recognizing that his first priority was to stabilize the company, he adopted a triage mindset and took quick, dramatic action. His early decisions included recommitting to the mainframe, selling the Federal Systems Division to Loral in order to replenish the company's cash coffers, continuing to shrink the workforce (reaching a low of 220,000 employees in 1994), and driving significant cost reductions within the company. Most importantly, Gerstner decided to reverse the move to spin off IBM business units into separate companies. He recognized that one of IBM's enduring strengths was its ability to provide integrated solutions for customers – someone who could represent more than piece parts or components. Splitting the company would have destroyed that unique IBM advantage.[25]""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM</a><p>Not that John Sculley managed to do anything remotely as good for Apple when he was recruited by Jobs from Pepsi.  ;)",1296464444

With the last MacBook Air refresh, screen resolution went up from 1280x800 to 1440x900. The current MacBook Pro 15"" has a resolution of 1440x900, based on past refreshes I think it's safe to assume that the new MBP 15"" will have a higher resolution than the current MBA. Most likely 1680x1050 but 1920x1080 isn't impossible.<p><i>""I would love to see the optical drive dropped in place of more battery life""</i><p>If Apple drops the optical drive in the next MBP 15"", they'll likely reduce the thickness of the notebook, as well as increase the battery life.",1296464409

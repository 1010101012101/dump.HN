Within one release of buying it, Apple removed the dongle from the copy protection system.  To be fair, this was pretty hard, as Logic actually offloaded some DSP processing onto it.<p>Today, the copy protection consists of:<p>1.  The installer phones home to see if your serial is blacklisted.  If Apple can't be reached, you can install it anyway (unlike activation).<p>2.  Serials are blacklisted with each point release<p>3.  Offline update install packages are behind a serial-wall on Apple's website, but are accessible with the system Software Update utility, which does not check serials.<p>4.  Logic Pro broadcasts its serial over Bonjour, and won't start if another system on the local LAN is using the same serial<p>This is by far and away the most lax copy protection system of any of the professional DAWs.  The primary copy protection is that it's mac-only, and the people who blow $2k on a mac aren't likely to balk at a few grand on good software.",1265929153

1119014,comment,1117512,1118974,0,0,pyre,,,"I guess the main point is whether or not all of these broadcasters and/or tv manufacturers have done safety studies of the effects of 3D 'all the time' in our lives verses just during a 2-3 hour movie every once in a while. I could definitely see people (in these companies) dismissing there being a problem just because ""people go to 3D movies all the time"" even though the 'amount of exposure' is orders of magnitude different.<p>> <i>I am a bit sensitive about this general issue (nothing to do with 3d) as there have been quite a few deaths in my area in the last year due to people's fears of radiation from mobile phone towers (which are in fact no where near their house, but that is another issue).</i><p>I'm not advocating that kind of crazy. I'm just saying that it would be entirely irresponsible for companies to push this technology without any sort of testing. In general, I would be mostly concerned with children. I don't want to bring out the 'think of the children' argument here, but children have developing brains, and if this could adversely affect their brain development there should be a bold warning label at the very least. (Or such broadcasts should just be 'few and far between' -- i.e. only some 3D movies on TV or a 3D channel or ability to switch between 3D version and 2D version -- so as not to force children/parents into the 'consume potentially harmful content or consume no content at all' decision)<p>On the flip-side of your argument, I think that entirely too many companies rush products to market before bothering to ponder any sort of implications (though this is mostly just a problem with food/medical products, but things like infant-/baby-oriented products have this issue too).",1265928972

1118999,comment,1118042,1118743,0,0,dkimball,,,"@old-gregg:<p>> ""Ever heard of soil erosion/degradation? Check out what happened to Easter Island. It takes thousands of years to turn a desert into a jungle, so in practical terms forests are non-renewable.""<p>On forests, my point was that a forest is not the same kind of thing as a coal mine: it can regrow as well as fade out. Incompetent forestry can destroy a forest, of course; but forests can be managed, as was done in Europe historically, or enriched.<p>Archaeologists and ecology-oriented companies have recently begun to popularize a soil-enrichment technique, ""terra preta do Ã­ndio,"" which was first practiced by the Amazon Basin civilization of South American Indians, and which uses charcoal and fertilizer (or any source of bioavailable carbon and nitrogen; the Amazonian Indians used fecal matter) to transform barren soil into a rich loam that regenerates at a rate of about a centimeter a year. This is a process that can be done very quickly -- especially with contemporary technology -- and the soil is usable in a more enriched form in about a year, requiring no further fertilizer or other forms of enrichment. See _1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus_ for details; its author goes so far as to argue that the Amazon forest as we think of it is a product of the now-lost Amazonian civilization, and is essentially an overgrown garden rather than a wilderness.<p>> ""on a practical timeline clean fossil water is unreplenishable: where do you think it comes from? And what do you think happens to a lake near an abandoned gold mine?""<p>You had said ""clean water,"" not ""clean fossil water."" I agree that fossil water is non-renewable, but water in general can be purified. Even sites like abandoned gold mines, and damaged bodies of water around them, can be cleaned up; I'd further add that if water is so cheap that it's not profitable to reclaim polluted lakes, we're not near the limits of the world's water supply.<p>> ""Several of your points have nothing to do with the topic, i.e. having enough resources to sustain the ever growing population: what difference does it make either oil is biological in origin or not?""<p>My point on oil: if it's not biological in origin, there may be an awful lot more of it than we thought. (And even then, with nuclear, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and increasingly solar power, we can survive without oil; its merits are its abundance and its high energy density.)<p>* Also, for Easter Island, see a New Scientist article on the subject (<a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19125621.100-easter-island-a-monumental-collapse.html?full=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19125621.100-easter-is...</a>); Jared Diamond's account may not be accurate at all. I would also add that the people of Easter Island lost the ability to read their writing system (Rongorongo), which tends to predict a very large range of problems. Maya civilization collapsed shortly after losing the ability to read their script, too -- but it collapsed in an environment that did not have any ecological degradation.",1265928699

Parents began to teach us how to read, write, and do basic arithmetic before we ever were sent to public schools.  I think I entered first grade reading and writing at an 8th grade level and knowing long division.  Took until about 8 years old for me to grasp basic algebra.  They held back after that point, otherwise we would've had a mind-numbing experience until at least high school.  However the school board was made aware that these first graders could be head of the 6th grade class, so we were allowed to freedom to learn other things (and sit in a few other classes once a week - mostly English, math and history).<p>Oh, right.  College.  That was our responsibility.  They would help with loan payments a bit, but they certainly couldn't afford to even put us through a state school.  We were expected to get scholarships.  If we didn't, well, it was that much more we'd have to borrow.<p>Honestly, I can't blame them.  We were certainly a lower-class family.  They couldn't afford to move near a nice school district, private schools, or help with private colleges, so they decided to get us WAY ahead of the curve (even though I have memories of crying because at 3 years old I was having obvious difficulties with multiplication.    ultimately we were incentivized with spare change).  Even then, the nice school districts aren't all that great.  What my folks did will still allow any child to get far ahead of any child in the best private schools in your area.<p>In the end we ended up with extremely large scholarships (that I didn't bother with because I'd still have to take out the equivalent of a home mortgage) and teenage years with an enormous amount of free time.  Cost to my parents who only had a high school degree (mom) and a GED (dad)?  Some of their free time every night.",1265927150

You can, of course, do whatever you want to with the credit card data at the risk of not being PCI compliant. Small startups are rarely at risk for a breach, but I'd personally prefer not to be in a position to deal with that liability. As it relates specifically to those companies, they need to apply to be on that list. I know that Recurly is currently working on it and Chargify is still in private beta, so I'm assuming it's something they're working on. That said, I have confidence that some of these companies will ""do it right"" and obtain PCI compliance/validated service provider status by the time it becomes a legitimate concern.<p>I've talked to both Recurly and Chargify directly. Recurly is apparently PCI Level 2 compliant and working on the external audit to reach level 1. Chargify is outsourcing storage ( <a href=""http://chargify.com/blog/adding-payment-gateways-while-maintaining-data-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chargify.com/blog/adding-payment-gateways-while-maint...</a> ) which addresses a lot of concerns, but I'm not sure if they've gone through the necessary compliance process otherwise. As for CheddarGettar, the only mention of PCI compliance I can find on their site is this - <a href=""http://support.cheddargetter.com/discussions/questions/39-pci-compliance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.cheddargetter.com/discussions/questions/39-pc...</a> - which doesn't really indicate an understanding of what is actually required to be compliant. I can't comment on Spreedly as I didn't look at their solution, but I do know one of the devs previously worked at a large PCI shop.<p>So a service provider like these guys can technically be PCI compliant, but not be on the service provider list if they haven't applied to be. If you use them, though, they best be on the list by the time you reach the point that the PCI assessor (they don't like to be called auditors. ;)) is knocking on your door. This isn't likely to be for a while for most startups, though.<p>In some of the early data I've seen in a survey I'm doing (shameless plug: <a href=""http://www.untitledstartup.com/2010/02/payment-security-survey-for-startups/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.untitledstartup.com/2010/02/payment-security-surv...</a> ), most companies are implementing their own system directly to paypal or similar, but have not actually gone through the process necessary to become PCI Level 4 certified. Most feel that the benefit of keeping the payment flow on their site is more important than the relatively small risk of being compromised. Can't say I agree, but I'm more paranoid than most.",1265926426

The problem with scalable incomes is that they scale down as well as up. Say you found a system that has a 1% chance of making you $100,000 a year and a 99% chance of making $5 a year. For the average person, that's a pretty shitty deal since it's only got an expected value of $1000 a year.<p>But sell the system to 1000 people and you can find 10 who enthusiastically talk about the wonders of scalable income and ponder wisely about the various choices they made that got them to where they are today and how everyone should join them in the wonderful scalable utopia.<p>It's all bullshit, without accounting for the hidden failures, it's impossible to determine how much pure luck played a role.",1265926272

The answer may be specific to you.<p>One area that&#x27;s getting some awareness in the literature is that some people are normally sensitive to insulin and some people are resistant to it.

Thus, &quot;an attacker [who] can purchase mining power&quot; needs to be able to do so at a lower cost than the value of the bitcoins he will spend for the second time. Obviously, considering the hashrate and the fact that you need around 51% of it, or, 30% of it according to some calculations, I can&#x27;t envisage any scenario where such a cost would in any way be justified by simply spending your own coins twice.<p>Moreover, one has to consider that if such hashing power was used to simply do what it is meant to do, then the attacker would be supplied with fresh new bitcoins, probably to the tune of far more than any amount he can double spend.<p>That is why &quot;the Bitcoin protocol is a stable Nash Equilibrium.&quot;",1432238122

By starting with a small niche, your goal will also be small. So it will be easier to figure out whether you are on the right track.<p>3. You will be able to become the market leader in a small niche much faster than you can become the market leader in the coaching industry. Once you have validated your business in the niche, it is much easier raising funding for the larger goal.",1432237546

But the thing is that with 1:1 multi-threading you can build many abstractions on top and for example on top of the JVM frameworks using Erlang&#x27;s model like Akka [1] and Quasar [2] are very popular. Either way, you can&#x27;t compare Erlang with platforms whose notion of parallelism involves POSIX&#x27;s <i>fork</i>, but lo and behold, I&#x27;m comparing it with Java because I can.<p><i>MOST</i> problems are not easily parallelizable and you&#x27;ll end up with concurrency. Concurrency means synchronizing and sending messages between processes. For example sending messages between processes means opening a socket of some sort, serializing the data you want to send and deserializing it on the consumer&#x27;s side. That&#x27;s extremely inneficient and there&#x27;s no way you can end up with a pipeline of tens of millions of messages per second, but with 1:1 multi-threading you can [3]. Erlang can&#x27;t cope with this load btw.<p>One other thing I like about working with threads is the user-friendliness. Yes, skipping over the perils of multi-threading which you can sort of avoid by using better libraries, you can easily do things like number crunching using &quot;parallel collections&quot;, combine actors with reactive streams and futures, or fake asynchronous I/O by blocking threads. People nowadays tend to underestimate the utility of blocking threads, but it&#x27;s pretty cool having an interface like `def fetchData: Future[Result]` that could be implemented on top of Netty (asynchronous I/O) or with JBDC (blocking I/O), only suffer a very small penalty and your process to still be able to reach 80% of CPU utilization.<p>So I think OCaml getting multi-threading support is a pretty big deal.<p>[1] <a href=""http://akka.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akka.io/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/puniverse/quasar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/puniverse/quasar</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/</a>",1432236900

9584939,comment,9581186,9584551,0,0,pron,,,"> has given us more fruitful and abundant insight into the world and our lives in it than any other approach ever tried<p>But this is yet another argument over definition or a value judgement. I have spent most of my life studying math and science, and yet reading Dostoyevsky has given me much more abundant insight into my life than anything science ever taught me. The point is, of course, what do &quot;insight&quot; and &quot;relevance&quot; mean? Their meaning can be entirely subjective, and is certainly not scientific. For that matter, what does &quot;meaning&quot; mean?<p>There&#x27;s no doubt that science has improved our lives, but so has politics (which has often been very much influenced by contemporary science). True, technology&#x27;s effects are quantifiable and measurable, but being quantifiable and measurable is not the only way of assigning value.<p>As to non-naturalist ethics, I see absolutely no problem with concepts that are irreducible to atoms. Neither is math, even though math was created/discovered by humans, which live in this universe and are composed of atoms. I think that you&#x27;re misrepresenting those ideas when you&#x27;re describing them as &quot;essential components of the universe&quot;, when the universe is merely the arena where these concepts form. The fact that you can find a causal chain -- a reduction, if you will -- does not mean you can always describe the end of the chain in terms of the first link (I&#x27;ll get to that again later).<p>In short, I don&#x27;t think you can reduce, say, literature, to atoms and forces even though the author and the reader are composed of atoms, and the reading process involves photons hitting receptors that start a chemical reaction in the retina. Doing so will teach us nothing of value about literature.<p>I think that it is your position -- that only that which can be reduced to atoms -- that lacks justification. Saying that science and technology are quantifiably or &quot;physically&quot; useful is <i>almost</i> (not quite) a tautology. A shovel is more useful than a pen for digging holes, but who says digging holes is more worthwhile than writing? Even if you <i>think</i> it is, you cannot prove it scientifically, because science can say nothing about values, only point at relationships between causes and outcomes.<p>> As we learn more and more fundamentally independent propositions and unite our disparate magisteria: wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen! And this will extend to the moral realm as well, so that when we say torturing puppies is wrong, we will know that we are describing a matter of fact.<p>That doesn&#x27;t follow. First, I don&#x27;t know how science can teach us that something is &quot;wrong&quot;. I don&#x27;t know by what scientific or mathematical mechanism you can ever make the jump from the &quot;is&quot; to the &quot;ought&quot; -- at the very best science can teach us that if we seek a certain outcome, we should take a certain action, but can it tell us what outcome we should seek?<p>But it&#x27;s even worse than that because there is another philosophical, unscientific mediating factor here, which is &quot;understanding&quot;. Being able to describe the universe and understanding it are two very different things. We can know without understanding. In fact, I can even give the last statement a more mathematical facet: that a process B reduces to a more fundamental process A, does not guarantee that fully knowing A will let us predict B because of intractability. We already know that most &quot;interesting&quot;, i.e. complex processes in the universe are intractable, so at best, they are theoretically reducible, but rarely practically so. Our understanding of particle physics can teach us little about psychology (although it may assist in building instruments to study psychology).<p>So I disagree both with your assumption that we can know (or rather, that knowing means fully understanding or predicting), as well with the supposed consequences of knowledge.",1432236843

I saw it consistently being brought up in conversations regarding minimum wage, which is very interesting to me for some reason.<p>So this is the report that was supposed to show that minimum wage increases don&#x27;t affect employment rate (infact, they actually might improve it), however, when you look at the data presented within the study itself, you find that indeed, the NJ employment rate seemed to increase, and the PA employment rate seemed to decrease slightly.  However, when you look at the number of employees per fast food restaurant, you&#x27;ll see that the NJ restaurants started at a much lower number per restaurant than the PA restaurants, and then that employees per restaurant metric raises up by the end of the study but it never reaches the same number as the PA restaurants.<p>What that study actually seemed to show to me, is given the ample notice that business owners had about the minimum wage increase, they thinned out their workforce.  Then the minimum wage increase came (the study actually started shortly after the increase had already been put in place, I believe), and the business owners realized they over thinned out the workforce, hired a few more people to get to the right number which was still less than the PA number with lower labor costs.<p>And since we don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum, once a business owner realizes their store in NJ can run on 18 people, why should they run their store in PA with 20?  It could probably make due with 19.<p>However, no one ever brings up the point that per restaurant, NJ never had as many employees as PA, essentially stating that PA was using more employees to accomplish the same job as NJ, which is exactly what you would expect to happen from an increase in labor cost.<p>Instead, everyone only focuses on the jobs added/lost during the short time of the study.  It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m the only person in the world who actually looked at the data in the report, instead of just reading the author&#x27;s findings.

9584855,comment,9584325,9584325,0,0,clickok,,,"I love stuff like this, and I think &quot;unreasonable&quot; is almost an understatement.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;unreasonable&quot; mainly because it occasionally captures subtle aspects of the data source for &quot;free&quot;. 
If you&#x27;ve worked with procedurally generated content, Markov chains, and so on, you probably have had to perform a few tweaks in order to get plausible results[1].
From the article, an excerpt of the output from an RNN trained on Shakespeare:<p><pre><code>  Second Lord:
  They would be ruled after this chamber, and
  my fair nues begun out of the fact, to be conveyed,
  Whose noble souls I&#x27;ll have the heart of the wars.

  Clown:
  Come, sir, I will make did behold your worship.

  VIOLA:
  I&#x27;ll drink it.
</code></pre>
Sure, the individual blocks are similar to what you&#x27;d get from a Markov text generator-- <i>but it gets that after a full stop, there comes a newline, a new character name, and a new text block</i>.
To my eyes, this is a qualitative leap in performance.
It suggests that the model has figured out some things about the data stream that you&#x27;d normally have to add in by hand[2].<p>It&#x27;s also unreasonable that the same framework works well for so many different data sources.
My experience with other generative methods has been that they were fragile and prone to pathological behaviour, and that getting them to work required for a specific use case required a bunch of unprincipled hacks[3]. 
It used to be that when a talk started to veer towards generative models, I&#x27;d start looking around the room, wondering whether I could survive the drop from any outside-facing windows.
But with RNNs using LSTM (or neural Turing machines!) you can consider incorporating a generative model in the solution you&#x27;re putting together without having to spend a huge chunk of time massaging it into usefulness and purchasing time on a supercomputer[4]<p>1. I once wrote quick a Reddit bot with the aim of learning to repost frequent highly upvoted comments and trained it using a simple k-Markov model... it was not good at first, and in order to get it to work I had to do a lot of non-fun stuff like sanitizing input, adding heuristics for when/where to post, and at the end it was mediocre.<p>2. Alex Graves (from DeepMind) has a demo about using RNNs to &quot;hallucinate&quot; the evolution of Atari games, using the pixels from the screen as inputs. It&#x27;s interesting because it shows that same sort of tendency to capture the subtle stuff: <a href=""https://youtu.be/-yX1SYeDHbg?t=2968"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/-yX1SYeDHbg?t=2968</a><p>3. As in occult knowledge and rules-of-thumb, but you might also read this as a double entendre about myself and my colleagues.<p>4.

The natural condition of a free market is an equilibrium between supply and demand. If you have excess supply, it means the market is not at equilibrium, which means either (a) it&#x27;s in transition because of some recent change (not likely since the oversupply of low-end labor has been around for quite a while), or (b) the market is not free--something is skewing the supply-demand balance. The obvious candidate for that is...existing minimum wage laws.<p><i>> The minimum wage is just a needed correction for this oversupply of labor</i><p>Raising the minimum wage will not &quot;correct&quot; the oversupply of labor; it will make it worse.

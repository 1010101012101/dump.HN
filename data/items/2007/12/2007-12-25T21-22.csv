EVDO/UMTS/WiMAX will finally make the internet as ubiquitous as cellular phone technology. 2008 is the year of connected portable devices. Kindle, iPhone, and Dash are its origins.<p>3. The iPhone will gain a huge chunk of the mobile device market, and after the 3G version is introduced with a spiffy sdk, it will engulf Windows Mobile like a bear eating an ant.<p>4. This election will have the most informed voters in history due to the ease of research through Wikipedia. (Though the actual voting will be just as aimless.) <p>5. OpenID-based login systems will grow in popularity.<p>6. Michael Arrington will be punched repeatedly.<p>7. Ron Paul Graham will be elected president",1198619746

92629,story,,,24,15,gojomo,"Suggested YC News CSS patch",,"Currently, you can use a line-leading-space to create a PRE+CODE block in a YC News story or comment. This has an intended, usually desirable effect -- the PRE+CODE text does not wrap. If the PRE+CODE text includes a long line, however, there is another usually undesirable effect -- the width of the enclosing block element grows, and then even <i>non</i> PRE+CODE text anywhere on the page fails to wrap. Reading even simple unrelated paragraphs/comments then requires horizontal scrolling.<p>Here is the above paragraph with a leading space to trigger/demonstrate the problem:<p><pre><code> Currently, you can use a line-leading-space to create a PRE+CODE block in a YC News story or comment.

A simple fix would be be to add to the news.css stylesheet:<p><pre><code> pre {overflow:auto}
</code></pre>
Then, the PRE block will get its own horizontal scrollbar, when necessary.",1198617541
92628,comment,92607,92620,0,0,dcurtis,,,"The word ""startup"" is slowly converging into the phrase ""internet company.""<p>A few years ago, all internet companies were startups. It's hard to differentiate between what is or is not a startup now that the market is growing older and startups are becoming either endups or part of Google.<p>This is a great list though. Dash looks very promising; it also represents a trend we'll probably start to see in 2008, which is the convergence of wireless data and portable devices (kindle and dash-type products).<p>23andme, while interesting, probably isn't a startup to ""watch"" this year, but maybe further down the road as the tools for genomic research become cheaper. <p>I've used FON, and while it's a great idea, I'm not sure how ""everywhere"" it really is. How often do you sit at a coffee shop and, by some miracle, happen to connect to a FON device someone else is using? It has never happened to me.<p>LinkedIn is probably a good one. Even though the interface is (or used to be) a hideous monstrosity, it's a great idea and I hope it succeeds wildly. If for no other reason than I want my professional network completely and absolutely separate from my Facebook network.",1198617321

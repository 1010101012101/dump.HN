6949522,comment,6949326,6949446,11,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> It&#x27;s just weird old thinking that has nothing to do with how the technology actually works.<p>It has nothing to do with the technology at all. A cable modem has perfectly adequate performance for a lot of commercial uses and the telecommunications companies want those customers to have to pay 50X as much for a leased line.<p>Which is why it doesn&#x27;t make any sense for Google to be doing it. Their purpose isn&#x27;t to upsell business customers, it&#x27;s to demonstrate demand for high bandwidth connections so they can pressure other telecommunications companies to increase capacity.<p>The whole &quot;heavy users&quot; thing is bunkum. Yes, 20% of the users transfer 80% of the data. That&#x27;s how pretty much everything works. \u0010\u0010People are diverse and have non-uniform usage patterns, and if you sort by consumption level then the high end tautologically uses more per capita than the low end. But bandwidth is <i>by far</i> not the predominant cost of providing internet service. The predominant cost is getting the wire to the endpoint whatsoever, once it&#x27;s there you can send as many bits as you can fit and upgrades are a matter of replacing terminating equipment rather than going back into manholes and bucket trucks. If bandwidth consumption were to quintuple it wouldn&#x27;t require any significant rate increase -- it has been increasing exponentially for years with no real trouble.<p>The only reason telcos talk about heavy users is that they want to engage in price discrimination and they know it confuses people who are used to dealing with commodities whose dominant cost is the unit cost rather than ones whose dominant cost is the fixed cost of building a distribution system.",1387691834

6949520,comment,6946491,6949458,3,0,charlieflowers,,,"I&#x27;ve seen projects that regretted going down those roads. I can&#x27;t say they failed because of it (sad truth be told, several of them failed because they were in such a dysfunctional corporate environment that they were doomed before the project even started).<p>CQRS can go wrong if you try to do only 90% of it instead of 100% of it. A crude analogy: consider a nation choosing to change the side of the road its cars drive on. So the US wants to switch over to driving on the left. Well, it pretty much needs to be a universal switch, or there are going to be ugly problems. CQRS is sort of like that. It changes so many assumptions that &quot;percolate&quot; through the whole architecture, that it&#x27;s pretty much an all or nothing thing. So if there is any dissension amongst the team, you&#x27;re likely to end up in a 90% (or less) situation and start having problems.<p>Plus, CQRS is complex, especially if you try to do it with a relational database. And the complexity is something you will have to carry, and it will weigh you down. (The ever-present caveat -- there are situations where CQRS can be a good approach).<p>DDD is interesting. It has so much appeal to it. Parts of it almost read like developer-porn. And there is a lot of wisdom there. However, it too brings complexity. It is not &quot;the simplest thing that could possibly work.&quot; Rather, it suggests you and your team really invest some mental cycles projecting the future and trying to design a domain object model that will suit your business for a long time.<p>That analysis could be valuable. It&#x27;s hard to argue that thinking ahead is a bad idea. However, many teams, in the process of performing that deep DDD analysis, have lost their way and gone overboard with unnecessary complexity. Maybe the flaw is with developers&#x27; innate vulnerability to the siren song of complexity moreso than with DDD itself. And I&#x27;m sure many have succeeded with DDD. But many teams have lost their way with it too, and usually by letting complexity get out of hand.",1387691816

6949496,comment,6949291,6949418,1,0,chimeracoder,,,"> I was surprised to see black heterosexual women ahead of any group other than homosexual men--and by a large margin<p>Me too, though for a different reason. At least at one point, I believe black and Latina women (not men) were more likely to be HIV+ than gay men[0], in certain parts of the US.<p>For gay men, a huge part of the problem is age. Notice how the infection rate for 13-24 demographic is disproportionately high. For this age group, HIV is a seemingly &quot;curable&quot; disease, because they never saw the terror of the 80s and early 90s in the US. They see HIV as an &quot;old man&#x27;s&quot; disease, and something that they don&#x27;t really have to worry about.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t believe the frustratingly obtuse reasoning I&#x27;ve heard from young gay men who <i>should</i> know better. I recently heard someone mention how he doesn&#x27;t need to practice safe sex, since he only hooks up with men his own age (under 30).<p>It&#x27;s not just the young crowd, though. Another person I know (in his late 40s/early 50s) believes that pre-exposure prophylactics[1] are an excuse for encouraging unsafe sex. In his words, &quot;there is no reason not to bareback anymore[2]&quot;.<p>Every time I see these stats, I start to worry that we&#x27;ve bottomed out and infection rates have begun to climb again. Perhaps it&#x27;ll take the next superbug (incurable gonorrhea?[3]) - history always seems to repeat itself.<p>[0] This was only for a short period of time, and I can&#x27;t remember if it was new infections during that time period or extant infections.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/prep/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/prep/</a><p>[2] He was actually a bit more graphic with this line, but I&#x27;ll keep this comment G-rated.<p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/incurable-gonorrhea-hits-north-american-shores/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/incurable-gonorrhea-hits-north-a...</a>",1387691022

What people typically want is the best of both worlds, to charge onto the grid when the produce more than they use (and get paid for it) and have the grid available to supply power when they generate less than they use.<p>This ought to be the best of both worlds for the electric grid, too, since solar generates electricity when load is at its highest.<p>However, the grid is not concerned with running efficiently, or with minimizing environmental damage.

6949452,comment,6948117,6949272,4,0,trrocket,,,"For many years it seemed likely it would be the Euro. At least Russia and Iraq circa 2002/3 publicly threatened making the switch, there may have been others. However, it seems that Iran stopped trading oil in USD (as of 2012) and apparently now uses a variety of other currencies[0], although I haven&#x27;t looked into this to see if it actually happened yet. I am under the impression that China currently buys oil from Iran in Yuan/Renminbi.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to know if Iran went ahead with its plan to stop accepting USD altogether. I&#x27;d personally be surprised if threats and posturing regarding Iran&#x27;s nuclear program went away without some sort of agreement on USD oil trade.<p>If Iran has stuck to its plan to stop accepting USD for oil AND the US backs off I think that signals a pretty significant loss for the US not just in terms of its relationship with Iran but ultimately, in the long term, in its attempts to remain a dominant force in the global economy. It would be a result of pressure from an international community that the US government feels it needs to keep on side, but also conversely an international community that may have an interest in reducing the economic dominance of the US.<p>Your second question is an interesting one. I think the US&#x27; next move - or Iran&#x27;s (potentially changing its mind about USD oil trade) - will tell us how strong the US is at this moment in time. The position of economic & military dominance the US currently enjoys (which helps its &quot;intelligence&quot; agencies to get away with actions that would be otherwise considered acts of war) is bound to end at some point. I&#x27;m not willing to stick my neck on the line and predict the end of US hegemony is nigh (I&#x27;m not really a crystal ball kind of person) but I&#x27;d just say that the signs of a superpower fighting for its position should be evident. There will come a point where the US can no longer risk such interventions.<p>EDIT:<p>Having read a bit more (though not much, to be honest, so I&#x27;m happy to be corrected) it seems the Oil Bourse is for oil-derived products not crude oil (it actually says this on the Wikipedia article, doh). Also part of the agreement that reduced sanctions on Iran was to stop taking gold as payment for oil[1]. So there&#x27;s no need to worry about the US&#x27; position in the world just yet.<p>Anyway, hopefully in 2014 some members of OPEC will be seriously advocating trading oil in dogecoin ;).

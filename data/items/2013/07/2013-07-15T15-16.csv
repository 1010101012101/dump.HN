I couldn&#x27;t find his quote, but I found an NEJM piece that references the same thing, although I think its in a nutrition debate.<p>&quot;The first published report of a clinical trial has biblical origins. In the Book of Daniel,5 reference is made to the unwillingness of the Israelite Daniel to accept the diet offered by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar. The king&#x27;s official had put a steward in charge of Daniel and his three friends (Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego):&quot;<p>&quot;Daniel said to the steward . . . Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king&#x27;s rich food be observed by you, and according to what you see deal with your servants. So he hearkened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days. At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king&#x27;s rich food. So the steward took away their rich food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables.&quot;<p>(<a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200301023480120"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200301023480120</a>)",1373903996

Not that it makes it somehow better or worse, just my opinion.<p>For example we have flexion system working smilary to that in sanskrit (you glue up pre and postfixes to the word to change the tense, mark the gender of the actor (mandatory), or depending on the case of the noun). German has sth similar only in a few places (past tense), and in concatenating nouns together. Most of the time word order and &quot;keywords&quot; decides on the tense, like in English. Polish have 7 cases (1 rarely used), sanskrit has 8 (1 rarely used), German has 4 IIRC.<p>Polish only recently (a few centuries ago) lost dual plurality that exists in sanskrit, and we still have relicts of that in many places, like proverbs, names for body parts, the way nouns change with numerals, etc.<p>And these all things aren&#x27;t specific to Polish - almost all Slavic languages share them.

Of these, reason A does not apply when talking to the authors in person.<p>I would like to hear if you have further explanations for what is behind this.  For example, I read in [2] that reading is much more complex operation for the human mind as compared to seeing or hearing because, assuming you believe in biological evolution, reading and writing came to humans only about 6000 years ago while verbal language and hearing came a few millions years back.

Attractive young women are desirable as they make other (especially male) employees happier as well as having advantages in certain roles (e.g. sales). This &#x27;premium&#x27; they enjoy is despite the risk of child birth being at its highest.<p>I know that this is very cynical point of view, but is it unrealistic? I have definitely witnessed it and it could well be a significant factor. Male attitudes to women are an extremely strong force in shaping society, and we might well expect them to go as far as distorting the job market as well. I know it is a little bit sad to undermine female accomplishment in this manner, but it is quite plausible.<p>This mechanism would also contribute the glass ceiling.

The wage gap has always been structural: women tend to be prevalent in lower wage jobs or are penalized more for default expectations about raising children or domestic work.

I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the Android documentation.<p>Let&#x27;s take just one example from literally hundreds that are scattered all over the API reference alone. The delete() method in SQLiteDatabase -- arguably, a mature part of the Android API, considering it&#x27;s been there ever since version 1 and is something that almost every application uses. Here: <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html#delete(java.lang.String"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sql...</a>, java.lang.String, java.lang.String[])<p>The method takes three arguments, but only two are documented. The description of the whereClause states that &quot;Passing null will delete all rows&quot;, while the function description says &quot;To remove all rows and get a count pass &quot;1&quot; ass the whereClause&quot;. I presume the difference between the two cases is that passing null as the whereClause will delete all rows without giving a count of how many, but that&#x27;s really poor taste in describing what the function returns.<p>This simply isn&#x27;t ok. It&#x27;s barely enough for internal use, where you&#x27;d probably Skype the guy who wrote it, ask for clarification, and kindly ask that they fix it when/if they have time (or you fix it yourself if possible), but this is <i>very</i> far away from what you want from a serious framework. Let&#x27;s not even stick iOS here. Look at Qt -- which optimistically would have, what, 10% of the users Android has, and a lot fewer developers -- and their documentation is <i>at the very least</i> complete.<p>Edit:<p>> The most annoying part of Android development is probably Eclipse, but I&#x27;d rather have a resource intensive IDE that&#x27;s cross platform than one that only runs on OS X<p>It&#x27;s definitely Eclipse, but in its description don&#x27;t forget &quot;unstable&quot; and &quot;<i>still</i> lacking a decent UI builder&quot;.",1373903073

See: <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00....</a>.<p>This is not to undervalue the statistic presented in the article, but I&#x27;m always a bit wary of comparisons involving &quot;equivalent education and experience.&quot; In Denmark, for example, 20-30% of women (depending on the study) work part-time, versus 8-10% of men. How do you compute &quot;equivalent&quot; experience with a part-time worker? Is 5 years of working an 80% work-week &quot;equivalent&quot; to 4 years of working full-time? Does a 30-year old woman who took 2 years off after college for childcare reasons have &quot;equivalent&quot; experience to a 28-year old man who did not? Mathematically that works out, but part-time work and time out of the workforce are death-blows to a resume, far out of proportion with the resulting differential in actual amount of experience.<p>I appreciate the ideas discussed in the article, but as the father of a daughter and the husband of a very ambitious woman, I have as slightly different perspective on the issue. Yes, it is important to avoid bias that results from the perceptions of men higher up in the hierarchy. At the same time, it&#x27;s crucially important to look at the other irrationalities in the system. I think it&#x27;s irrational that a women who takes a year off after the birth of a child is viewed by HR managers in a worse light than a man who took a year to backpack across Asia. I think it&#x27;s irrational that men are never expected to be the ones who downshift their careers for a time to help raise kids. I think it&#x27;s irrational that a period of downshifting is perceived as such a negative light in the first place.",1373902082

6046132,comment,6041625,6044024,1,0,omaranto,,,"Maybe you mean functors instead of endofunctors (an endofunctor goes from a category to itself)? But that&#x27;s a minor quibble, the main problem is I don&#x27;t understand which categories you mean? What are the objects and morphisms? My best guess (and I have to guess because you didn&#x27;t say) is that you mean to treat String and [String] as monoids and thus as one object categories. That is String is the category with a single object, the morphisms from that object to itself are all the possible strings and composition is concatenation; and similarly for [String] with list concatenation. If that&#x27;s what you meant several things are wrong:<p>1. split(&quot; &quot;) is not a functor because (x+y).split(&quot; &quot;) is not equal to x.split(&quot; &quot;) + y.split(&quot; &quot;), for example:<p><pre><code>    &quot;a BC&quot;.split(&quot; &quot;) == [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;BC&quot;], but
    &quot;a B&quot;.split(&quot; &quot;) == [&quot;a B&quot;] and &quot;C&quot;.split(&quot;  &quot;) == [&quot;C&quot;].
</code></pre>
(At least join(&quot; &quot;) is a functor, which here just means monoid homomorphism.) I guess this problem could be fixed by replacing String with StringsThatAreEitherEmptyOrEndInSpace (you need the empty string to be the identity for composition).<p>2. They are not adjoint, even after fixing the monoids to make them homomorphisms! It&#x27;s easy to easy that if f and g are adjoint monoid homomorphisms, with unit  and counit , then the functions m   f(m) and n  g(n)  are inverses of each other. This does not happen here since, for example, join(&#x27; &#x27;) is not injective.<p>Can you fix the example, maybe by regarding them as categories in some other way? My gut feeling is that this won&#x27;t work, but I haven&#x27;t thought about it very much.<p>If, as I suspect, this adjointness is wrong and not easily fixable, does it still have value as an explanation?

Because the different compilers are almost certainly not functionally identical, the various Bk should not be expected to be bitwise identical.  However, because they are compilations of the same source, they should be <i>functionally</i> identical, or one of the original compilers was broken (accidentally or deliberately).  So now we can compile that original source with the Bk compilers, and because these compilers <i>are</i> functionally identical, the results (Bk(S))should be <i>bitwise</i> identical.  There is certainly some chance of false positive, due to bugs in the Ck compilers or exploitation of undefined behavior in S, but if you do get the same output (Bk(S)) from all of the (Bk) compilers then you can be pretty confident that there is no Trusting Trust style attack present: exceedingly so, when the various compilers have diverse histories so that it&#x27;s exceedingly unlikely that all Ck compilers contain the <i>same</i> attack.  If there are any differences, you can manually inspect them to determine what the issue is and either issue a bug report to the appropriate compiler, change the source (S) to avoid undefined behavior, or notify people of the attack present in the compiler in question, depending on what you find.  This does involve some binary digging, but quite targeted compared to a full audit and it may well not be necessary at all.<p>Obviously, if you do have a trusted compiler, including it in the mix is great, but the technique doesn&#x27;t rely on this, nor on any two compilers returning the same binary output except when they are compilations of the same source.",1373901286

The answer to the question is: &quot;because OS vendors have stopped doing their job&quot;.<p>Have you not noticed that the OS no longer provides the features of an Operating System?  Wouldn&#x27;t a &quot;true OS vendor&quot; have added peer-to-peer and file-sharing-across-multiple-networks/nodes to their feature set by now?<p>What I think has happened is that the OS vendors: Microsoft, Apple, and to a much lesser extent, the Linux crowd - have forgotten that they, themselves, define what the &quot;OS&quot; is, but it is the users who require it.<p>Why on Earth some OS vendor hasn&#x27;t solved this mid-80&#x27;s problem of network file sync, is simply this: there is no profit in it. In short, the bugs and holes in featuresets provided by the current OS vendors have been filled in by an industry far too furiously devouring itself to care that they&#x27;ve gone off-task.<p>The fact is, we should&#x27;ve had DropBox -like features integrated into our OS&#x27;s, already.  We should definitely have had Bittorrent-sync like features, implemented already.  We should definitely be demanding these sorts of features from the OS vendors - but do we?<p>The answer is, no.  We don&#x27;t.  Because, every 5 years or so, newcomers to the computer scene, the teenagers of the now who will be the next-bright-new-thing of the morrow, fail to keep up with the state of the art just well enough that they end up re-inventing the very thing that their much-hated &quot;prior generations&quot; have been, literally, on the cusp of inventing .. for years.<p>So yeah, we have this situation because there is no longer a &#x27;true OS&#x27; out there in the world, but rather &#x27;front-ends to a business model&#x27;.

I found this &quot;we are architecturally guaranteed a reseed&quot;  a bit confusing ,  maybe someone with more experience in random number generation and encryption makes some sense out of it .. if you check the code there&#x27;s a ASM call if the feature is supported and that&#x27;s it.

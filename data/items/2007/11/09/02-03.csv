What do you type?  Where do you click?"").\n6) hand the ""wireframes"" from the UI consultant off to our graphic designer\n7) review the sketches; decide to pick a new graphic designer\n8) get sketches back from second graphic designer; tell him ""No, make the color scheme more like Netflix"".  Repeat this last step in 100 different steps: feedback on size of elements, etc.  The engineering team provided the feedback, the graphic designer provided the expertise with fonts, layout, etc.\n9) done!<p>...well, actually, nothing is every done.  We've got to revamp the tabbed navigation, the RSS customization buttons, and a ton of other stuff...but it was well enough done to go live!",1194574257

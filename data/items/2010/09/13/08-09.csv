I'm a very extroverted individual (makes sense since I focus on the actual business part of startups - non-tech) and I can say I have this same ""shy and sheltered"" personality about entering the engineering scene.<p>God knows, how much I would love to get into it, as I'm sure you would love to get into the whole social scene.<p>Don't worry about ""where to start"" ""who to talk to"" ""what to learn and how"".  Just fucking do it.  Although I'm not encouraging underage drinking, pick up a cup, don't get too crazy, have a good time.<p>While you are trying to be social and extroverted for maybe the first time of your life, the ONLY thing that is going to make you look awkward to your frat brothers or any other people is how YOU see yourself.<p>Don't hesitate, get out there, get knee deep into the scene and pretty soon you'll have friends who appreciate you and you will be able to be real open with all of them.",1284368189

I wasn't being an asshole about it, I did it very carefully, it was a very hard thing to do because I'm usually very nice to everybody, it's second nature to me to not ruffle any feathers, I really framed everything in objective terms, made sure to tell her why I did it etc.<p>Next thing you know I'm sitting there in the conference room with a crying girl, and I'm not talking a silent tear crying, I'm talking full-out wailing in a way that the secretary from another company 2 doors down (!) came to check up on us, to see what was going on. So I come out like a bumbling idiot trying to make up an excuse for what was going on to that secretary, trying to calm down the girl I was interviewing, and she probably still went back home telling everybody what a heartless bastard I was.<p>So now even when people ask I'm very careful to phrase any feedback in the most general terms. It sucks for those who could handle the honest feedback, and I hope that others that I will interview with in the future are braver than I am, but this 'giving honest feedback' hasn't worked out for me.",1284368128

In Switzerland that meant a starting salary of at least six figures but money was not really a factor in my decision it was mostly based on the fact that I wanted to do what I liked.<p>In the year between my Bachelors and Masters degree I interned 6 months for a Swiss web/technology consulting company and 3 months for Accenture. Both experiences bored me to a degree I had not thought possible. It wasn't that I had no responsibility - which I had - or that the tasks were repetitive - they were only slightly - but I just wasn't faced with the challenges I was looking for. From quite early on I loved to create my own things and I realized that just was not possible in a corporate environment and I had to do something about it. My first plan - following conventions - was to be a part-time entrepreneur. I wanted to work at one of those strategy consulting companies and have my own thing on the side. When I look back that idea seems crazy but at that time I was convinced I could do both. But in March I talked to a successful Swiss Entrepreneur and he convinced me that this is an all or nothing game. Either I went all-in or I had to fold. I decided to go for it and haven't looked back.<p>As I said before money wasn't really a factor in this decision and that is for a few reasons:<p>1. I have a safety net through my parents. This obviously is a very comfortable situation that not everybody has.<p>2. I looked at my potential salary as opportunity costs and decided that it was worth the costs that I could do what I wanted.<p>3. If I need to I can still go work for those companies I decided to forgo now or another company. I have an excellent education and I see my entrepreneurial endeavors as an extension on that. Obviously after having been an entrepreneur for several years I probably won't fit into the mindset that Strategy consulting companies look for but there will be plenty of opportunities if need be.<p>4. I never had massive amount of money available to me. I always lived comfortably and still do but I was never a big earner and therefore don't have an expensive lifestyle to support. Also at the moment I don't have any responsibilities, no family, no children to support.<p>On a side note: The consequences of my decision to start my own business have not always been easy. One of the harshest things is that many of my friends now almost can swim in money but once I talk to them about their Job I am convinced to have made the right decision.",1284366625

The speakers from other countries tended to mumble, not make their point clear, and were downright boring. Part of the disparity might have been the language barrier (international speakers tended to have thick accents), but I wonder whether part of the difference is cultural (i.e. US speakers prepare for presentations more and are taught on how to give good presentations).",1333608175

3801549,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"Tips for successful gay surrogacy",,"Childrens are integral part of any ones family life and today there are many options available for people who got fertility issues, single parents and people who are gay. There is still not much acceptance in many parts of the world for Gay couple and in such situations gay surrogacy seems to be very feasible solution. Surrogacy is an option for gay men who wish to have a biological connection to their child. In a gestational surrogacy arrangement, one or more embryos would be created in an IVF cycle, using donor eggs and the individual or couples sperm.<p>Adoption and surrogate parenting are the only two options available for gay male parents who want to perceive the journey of parenthood. Adoption offers a couple the opportunities to give a baby who already exists, a loving home that the child may not have otherwise enjoyed. Surrogacy is an option for gay men who wish to have a biological connection to their child. In a gestational surrogacy arrangement, one or more embryos would be created in an IVF cycle, using donor eggs and the individual or couples sperm. Surrogacy offers a couple the options to be biologically related to the child, to cause this particular genetic child to come into existence, to actively participate in the pregnancy and to be recognized on the original birth certificate as the legal parent of the child.<p>Both adoption and surrogacy process allows the gay couple to enjoy parenthood. Adoption is not an easy process for gay couples as the process is very long, all the countries do not allow this option for gay couples and above all very few percentage of childrens are offered for gay adoption. Age also plays a major role which prohibits the intentional parents from adoption.<p>Such parents are not in ease with adopted child because of their genetical history. Secondly the intended parents always live in fear of the changing mindset of the mother of the child in crushing their healthy and loving hopes. Thus in light of all the positive options egg donation, sperm donation and surrogacy is the only reliable counter for gay who prefer genetical relationship over adoption. Hence surrogacy becomes the preferred journey for gay couples who want to enjoy the fatherhood.\nThere is much to learn about Gay surrogacy that the prospective gay parents must keep watch before entering into this type of arrangement. When the gay couple wishes to get the ball rolling towards obtaining a surrogate to carry a child for them, they need to consider following important steps before deciding for surrogacy.<p>1] \nConsider surrogacy versus other options like adoption, foster care, shared parenting.<p>2]\nConsider Traditional Surrogacy (TS) versus Gestational Surrogacy (GS). These options vary considerably in process, cost, duration, legality and likely future relationships with the surrogate /egg donor. In TS, a surrogate is carrying a baby conceived through artificial insemination using the sperm of one of the intended parents. In GS, a carrier is impregnated with embryos created through IVF, using the couples' sperm and donated eggs. The donor of the egg can be known, unknown from the family or even a friend.<p>3]\nThe most important thing is to decide is that who is to be biologically related to the child. The options that a couple can consider are One partner will become a parent for the first pregnancy and the second partner will parent the second child or should you mix your samples before the insemination /fertilization or One partner can be genetically connected by choosing a relative to be an egg donor and the other partner then donates the sperm. If you are doing IVF, you can fertilize half of the eggs with each sperm sample, so that the paternity of each embryo can be known, and you can choose to implant embryos from both dads.<p>4]\nDetermination of surrogate is equally important. Surrogate can be either your relative or friend or from the surrogacy agency. If the surrogate is through a surrogate agency then both the partners will be matched with a surrogate. You need to make it sure that surrogacy clinic offers Gestational Surrogacy to people of all nationalities including gay, lesbian, single mom and single dad.<p>India is one of the top destinations for gay couples and singles seeking a surrogate child as it is far more cost-effective than other countries.<p>5]\nOnce you are ready to make this commitment to start creating your family and be a proud parent, make sure to cover all the legal grounds for your surrogacy arrangement. A sound surrogacy and surrogate contract with no loopholes is utmost required.  \nMake sure you seek legal counseling to understand your rights and make sure your rights as intended parents are well-protected in your legal agreement. You must find out prevailing laws in your own country or from your respective consulate in country where you intend to start surrogacy process to facilitate and expedite the process for you to carry your baby back to your hometown.<p>6]\nIt is equally important to make it sure that you and your partner are both screened for infectious diseases and all other test along with surrogate. Thorough check of surrogate with respect to her past reproductive history, education, health, family support and her background should be done.<p>7]\nConsider the option of embryo freezing for the embryos that are not used in your first IVF attempt.

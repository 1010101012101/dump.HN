8976613,comment,8976451,8976451,0,0,ebiester,,,"Did you ever notice that nobody ever talks about how to cultivate disciplne? If it wee as easy as &quot;just go do it&quot; than everyone would.<p>The latest analogy of discipline is of a muscle. Do more and it gets bigger, right? Not exactly. While true in some aspect, it leads to bad choices on later decisions you make, at least in creative work.<p>Three ways to improve discipline:<p>1. Develop a mindful meditation practice. It will produce more awareness, which in my experience helps me get started and work through to the edge of where I am making bad decisions, and recognize if I&#x27;m bored or actually tired and adjust accordingly. You will know if it helps you within a few weeks.<p>2. Develop a choice minimal lifestyle. Arbitrary choices seemingly come from the same pool as discipline. Where possible, turn choices into a habit. &quot;I start at 9 because I start at 9&#x27; not because I choose to start at 9.&quot; It seems odd but it works.<p>3. Closely related, excersise will increase your mental endurance, which is as good as discipline in many cases. Diet also increased it -- while a quick glycogen hit can help for 15 minutes, I have found great benefit to dropping sugar and simple carbohydrates out of my diet while working. It&#x27;s worth seeing if it works for you.",1422709160

IT was insecure in the corporate space for a few decades (despite it being as fundamental to most companies as, say, the finance department) and many people fell into the trap of making it <i>sound</i> harder than it is in order to insure some job security.<p>The funny thing is, you don&#x27;t need to make it sound harder than it is by making up confusing buzzwords, <i>it&#x27;s already pretty hard!</i>. Especially in the enterprise space.<p>Imagine if the logistics department, or the aforementioned finance department decided to rebrand their standard practices every few years. It would cause ridiculous levels of confusion amongst the older workers, as they&#x27;d assume they needed complete retraining in this <i>new thing</i>. In reality, they probably just need, at maximum, a refresher  course to bring their skills up to date with the newer procedures.<p>If you ever find yourself describing your latest project to a non-IT-savvy friend or relative, then you quickly realise that the buzzwords and branding are unnecessary to get the concept across.

I would like to share a story of my own journey in this.<p>For a long time I had wanted to lose some weight and to remove some bad habits. It dawned on me that I could eliminate the habit altogether by scaling back to extreme levels. For example, I completely stopped eating sugary foods such as chocolate for 8 months. I stopped buying coffee from coffee shops every day. I replaced my meals with crazy simple meals such as rice, tamago kake gohan, potatos, eggs and vegetables. It is surprisingly easier to just cut something out of your life and then add things back as necessary.<p>It occurred to me if you can do this, you can do anything. You&#x27;re replacing daily motivation - which can be depleted (ego depletion) - with a unwavering commitment everyday - to eat simple things or forego things you did not even think twice about before. You just don&#x27;t do X. There is no way for you to self justify any more.<p>It is surprising how after a while, you do not really even miss the daily coffee or chocolate because you feel happy that you were disciplined enough to give it up. You&#x27;re strong.<p>In my case, my journey cross fertilised another goal: to cut down on expenses. It is shocking how much money we all spend for very little benefit!<p>I am sure someone will reply saying &#x27;life is for living&#x27; and all that. The question is, are they strong enough to do the same?",1422708077

I love to read about those kind of things.

You need to figure out your expectancy of accomplishing tasks, you need to figure out what&#x27;s valuable to you, you need to engineer your environment, you need to choose the right peers, and you need to have a vested interest in doing all of that in the first place.<p>The one thing that compasses this all is, in my opinion, this:<p>1) The ability to break things down to their bare minimum
2) The ability to execute those tasks
3) Keeping the goal in sight, always.<p>Humans are stupid. I am stupid. We are all stupid. We forget trivial stuff. We have to constantly remind ourselves why and for what we are doing something. This is not bad per se, just a lot of people don&#x27;t. A lot of things can help you in your goal. Motivated peers are, to me, a HUGE motivator.

I&#x27;m always looking for really good material on the subject. Unfortunately for some strange reason, most of the posts I&#x27;ve seen that get to the front page of Hacker News are woefully oversimplistic.<p>Even discipline is something that requires some sort of motivation to cultivate. It is something that you have to want to do, and getting yourself to want to do something isn&#x27;t (in my opinion) nearly as trivial as a lot of people pretend it is.<p>So screw motivation, screw discipline, what you need is a comprehensive, holistic solution that encompasses almost everything– that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so difficult to change your life.<p>1- You need to figure out your expectancy of accomplishing tasks. Discipline won&#x27;t help you if you bite off more than you can chew.<p>2- You need to figure out what&#x27;s valuable to you. There&#x27;s not much sense in getting disciplined at doing something you hate. PG wrote in one of his essays- paulgraham.com/love.html, I believe, where he talks about a doctor who became a doctor because she was so focused and disciplined– despite the fact that she never actually loved medicine.<p>3– You need to engineer your environment + choose the right peers. This is way more than half the battle, and it also involves taking more drastic action than a lot of people are comfortable with.<p>4- You need to chop up your tasks into things that have nearly-immediate feedback, because otherwise hyperbolic discounting makes things seem irrelevant and unimportant to us (especially bad if you have ADHD).<p>5- You need to have a vested interest in doing all of the above. That means having some sort of reason or motive... which you might also call &quot;motivation.&quot;<p>TL;DR:<p>Motivation / discipline / getting-stuff-done is a lot more complicated than &quot;screw X, do Y&quot;.<p>PS:<p>&quot;Screw X, do Y&quot; seems to be a rhetoric device writers use when want to drum up strong feelings in people, dividing people into Camp X and Camp Y. Once you learn to see it, it actually gets rather boring and underwhelming. If you skip all the rhetoric, what the writer is saying is to develop habits. &quot;Start small&quot;, that&#x27;s it.<p>Would&#x27;ve been more interesting to read a post about the specific development of habits.

If they are standardized, they are usually very application specific and not really general enough. For example lambda calculus has a nice graphical representation as string diagrams, since it corresponds to calculations in a cartesian closed category. Typed lambda calculus has a similar representation, but with multicolored strings.<p>Pretty much any problem easily modeled as data flow has a nice a nice representation in an appropriate (traced, braided) monoidal category, examples would be electrical circuits, chemical reaction networks (simple atmosphere models, so called &quot;Box models&quot; are an example), hardware control software (LabVIEW), general ODE/Statemachine simulation (SIMULINK), &quot;business processes&quot; (forgot the name of the vendor), not to mention the various video/audio/shader programming environments.<p>Probably the intersection between the people capable of building a &quot;generic&quot; programming language for graphical programming and people who know enough category theory to inform the design is zero, even though software that solves subproblems of this kind is very successful. Ultimately you really want at least a 3d graphical language, because you want to express relations between 2d processes (for example the equation a+b = b+a, should be really understood as such a 3d process). Coincidentally relations between functions is something even programming languages like Haskell fail to address, it has type classes, but no way of specifying the equations that are required to hold.<p>The only language I&#x27;m aware of that does that is Magma, which unsurprisingly is based on Operads (essentially multicolored monoidal category with a fixed set of monoidal functors and natural transformations) and was designed by mathematicians and to a lesser extend Mathematica and Prolog.",1422705761

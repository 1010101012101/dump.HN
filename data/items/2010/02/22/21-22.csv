But they have a strong incentive to have bad content! If your article on ""how to make pancakes"" tells someone how to make pancakes, they close their tab and make pancakes; if it's 300 words of ""original content"" that makes no sense, you'll end up clicking through to another site (that has to pay for the privilege).<p>When you think of how many struggling freelancers use those long-tail guides to build their business (""How to shoot a commercial for a gym,"" or ""How to write brochure copy for life insurance,""), you can see the magnitude of this problem. People who could trade their time for traffic now have to trade their <i>money</i> for traffic. When they're just getting started, money is harder to come by than time. The result: fewer people creating this kind of content, more of them joining organizations that pay for the traffic instead.",1266875961

What with increasing reliance on IDE assistance (and I'm guilty of this) I can easily imaging feeling overwhelmed with just a sheet of white in front of me.<p>I've tried to do thing mostly verbally, testing their underlying understanding of CS concepts, and hoping this is a decent proxy for development ability.<p>If you design the questions carefully, the <i>way</i> the applicant answers tells as much as the fact that it's right or wrong.<p>For example, in a C tech interview I'd ask what you need to if you want to pass variables into a function, and have the function change those values for you. There are a range of correct answers from ""put an ampersand in front of the variable"" to ""call by reference rather than call by value"", and these shows different levels of understanding.<p>I also liked to ask about what the difference between single quotes and double quotes were. A simple correct answer is ""one's a character, the other is a string"", but somebody who really gets C would tell me that one will lead to the generation of an integer value, while the other results in a pointer.<p>So it's not just right/wrong, it's shades in between. With some careful design, you can ask questions that tell a lot about how well somebody <i>understand</i> programming.<p>But occasionally I'd bump into somebody who just couldn't get any of my questions at all, and I'd feel really bad as I tried to think of something simple enough that they wouldn't feel completely awful.",1266875362

It is vital to have legal separation between your company and yourself--whether that be in the form of an S/C Corp or a Limited Liability Company. I just incorporated in Illinois and it cost me about $400 through LegalZoom. They took care of everything and all the rest was handled through my accountant for another $200. That amount is trivial given the structure and protection I now have with an S Corp.<p>As far as the stock option package--they messed up and shouldn't have formed an S Corp. S (Small Business) Corps are pass-though just like LLC's--the shareholders pay personal taxes on the profits of the company.

IMO asking someone whether they can program a loop that demonstrates the use of a mod operator is a 'gotcha' test because it proves nothing as far as their suitability as programmer and as an employee and is designed soley to weed people out based on one thing.

Lots of programmers don't do well in high-pressure situations... which incidentally programming is <i>not</i> most of the time.<p>How about asking someone how they got interested in programming, or what sort of things they've created with their knowledge in and out of work, or what languages/technologies they've taught themselves in their free time, how they go about fixing puzzling software problems, or what they consider to be good vs. bad programming practices, or even what their hobbies are? - those kinds of things that will tell you IMO whether they are smart, passionate, and will make a good employee.",1266875261

The adults in the Peanuts cartoons were ""voiced"" by a trombone with a plunger mute, which gives the impression of a voice without necessarily sounding like it's saying anything in particular. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanuts#Television_and_film_productions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanuts#Television_and_film_pro...</a>)<p>Second, it's actually possible to make it sound slightly like specific words by altering the shape and size of your vocal cavity while playing a note. When this is combined with slight glissandos, it can be made to sound a lot like speech. In fact, there is a piece for solo trombone called ""General Speech"" which uses this technique to recreate General MacArthur's farewell speech at West Point on the trombone.

And they're even significantly cheaper than the originals. I'm not the type that cares to bother with more than one portable device, so the iPhone being a gaming device that is popular with big developers is quite the plus.",1266872612

Another difference between the iPhone and Android platforms.  If an app is <i></i>not<i></i> in the iPhone apps store, there is literally no way for a user to install it on a non-jailbroken iPhone.  With Android, it only requires checking one checkbox in the Android settings to allow you to install non-market apps on an Android phone.  No rooting, jail-breaking, etc. required.",1266872591

There are plenty of places that could use more cheap produce in their towns.<p>It's understandable that Bloomingfoods (the local organic grocery store) is so expensive since they are paying for the prime retail location space in town compared to Wal-Mart which is out in the county.  You are paying for the luxury of walking or biking to their stores - Wal-mart is only accessible by Car or Bus.  Trading convenience for price.<p>For a slightly different trade-off, there are about 40 or 50 people who just started buying in a food buying club once a month directly from the distributor that Bloomingfoods buys from (UNFI).  They don't have much in the way of local fresh produce (we get that from the farmer's markets and CSAs), but the canned goods, bulk items and hosehold items are typically between 30-50% cheaper than Bloomingfoods and the pickup is right in town.  If you are interested, let me know and I can get you the info.",1266872590

One quibble I would have is that I think the pleaserobme phenomenon is less ""culture of fear"" and more just part of the age-old Internet game of gotcha.

This would be mutually beneficial for the actors involved through the typical mechanisms of revolving door politics. It would seem almost delusional to me to think that those typical motives wouldn&#x27;t have been present in this case.

This in itself all kind of makes sense once you know it, but the danger lies in that it&#x27;s code that worked in py2, and even now it will still run because most functions that work on bytes also work on unicode. It&#x27;s not until you try to combine these variables with data from other sources(like string literals) which were/weren&#x27;t unicode you notice this and then you don&#x27;t know which side wad correct so you randomly just shotgun either decode on one side or encode on the other side.

This article flat out admits that they have no idea what the motive is. Apparently this strange manipulation was not significantly more profitable than not performing it.<p>I have no illusions about the morality of the players involved in the financial crisis. But this article is trash. Presumably by publishing a piece in a popular news site, the author is at least claiming to have done some researched and gained at least some understanding of the topic beyond what a typical layman might achieve.  If that is the case (and I seriously doubt it is) then the only rational conclusion that I can form from this article is that they might not have been engaging in illegal activities purely for profit. People aiming to earn billion dollar payouts and playing with the volatile fire that is public opinion don&#x27;t engage in needless games and risks &quot;just to fuck with us&quot;.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t doubt at all that something seriously wrong was happening, but this article should never have made it past an editor.",1450606328

Those two agencies? RSA and NSA. They paid both of these organizations for the privilege of getting insight.<p>NSA had been pushing for Dual_EC for a couple years at this point, and wanting people to take the bait, they secretly gave $10 million to RSA for them to start using it in some of their products and for them to tell NIST that they thought it was cryptographically sound. All completely behind the back of NIST and the public.<p>So NIST is consulting out with two of the biggest names in cryptography, one of which had been championing Dual_EC for years (NSA), and one of which started using it in their products (which are primarily sold to government agencies that MUST use NIST-approved crypto, and presumably stood to lose a lot of money by &quot;betting&quot; on Dual_EC).<p>NIST never saw it coming.<p>And that&#x27;s the irony of the whole thing. NSA is supposed to make the US, especially the US government, more technologically secure... yet they directly undermined cryptography that was predominately used by government agencies. Meanwhile the rest of the tech world saw it for the bullshit it was. The only people who were hurt by it was our government.<p>Thomas Massie gave a great speech to congress about this earlier this year, and pushed through a vote that now prevents NIST from contracting out with NSA. I wish I could find it.<p>(Aside: Thomas Massie, a congressman from Kentucky, graduated from MIT with a BS in EE and a MS in ME, founded a successful tech startup, and now serves on the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. One of the few cases where I feel someone in our government is adequately educated in what they rule over.)",1450605992

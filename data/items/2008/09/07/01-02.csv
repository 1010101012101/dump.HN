Working with weights is about repetition. Too much and you overtire or worse, injure yourself.

Probably the only really performance sensitive ones were to our SOLR-based search.<p>Yes, you can easily move chunks of the address space around, but we decided that the pain that results from remapping (like when you add a new machine) is worse. We very rarely had a problem with our master (which we ran in master-master replication, how's that for term overloading). The few exceptions were times that our own bad code ran amok driving load. It was way better to invest in an automatic query killer.",1220751393
297161,comment,297054,297054,0,0,aaroniba,,,"I think the user interface for data entry is the key problem in using software to track gym workouts.  I lift 4x per week and have tried various workout logging software, but have yet to find anything that works better than a simple notebook and pen.<p>A typical session's data includes 6 exercises, 4 sets each, weight and rep count for each set, so 48 numbers altogether, all related to each other in different ways.  Plus I like to keep notes in the margin like ""grip the bar wider"" or ""slower negative movement"".<p>If you can create an iphone app with a user interface that makes it really really easy to enter workout data, then I think you would find a large market.  I payed for gyminee.com because I thought it might deliver this, but the data entry was still too annoying.  The built-in Notes program on the iphone was actually better.<p>Also, as other people have mentioned, ""overtraining"" has negative connotations, so I'm curious why you picked this name.<p>Best of luck. I think this is something people want.",1220751388

297152,comment,295304,296118,0,0,thwarted,,,"I read that as an observation, not opinion.  The interfaces that are the best end up ugly, not that ugly interfaces are the best.  Not because they need to be ugly, not because quick and efficient means ugly, not because ugly means doesn't require training, and not because there is a bias against aesthetics among hackers.  They are ugly because no one actually cares what the admin interface looks like as long as it gets the job done.<p>As for hackers having a bias against aesthetics, I find this to be false.  There is beauty in efficiency independent of looks.  Getting the job done and being able to go home gives people pleasure.  Concentrating on the veneer of the UI while ignoring user productivity is not providing a decent user experience, because a large portion of the user experience is based on getting the end results, not on the trip to get there.  The chore of going to the supermarket is not made significantly better by taking the scenic route or having the building that houses it be designed by some big name architect, it's made better by minimizing the time it takes to perform (efficiency).",1220750646

So not a <i>bullshit</i> thought.<p>You only need the muscles to <i>position</i> the body. Structure and grounding toward the earth is the source of strength, not actual muscle exertion. If you can properly use your body you will not need the muscles for more than position, <i>not</i> resistance.<p>Real speed and strength comes from complete <i>relaxation</i> and not tension, which weight lifting only promotes.<p>The problem, in my eyes, of current weightlifters, is that they believe that they are <i>healthy</i> because they can lift certain weights under certain conditions. Move to a different context and that ""strength"" does no good and generally is a detriment both to coordination and to speed.<p>Let me add that this is from a martial artist perspective. Of course muscles are needed to do <i>work</i> like climb a mountain or such, but your are better at growth trying to climb that mountain than some form of gym weightlifting activity.",1220750500

A lot of coworkers are pretty hardcore developers but still insist on using OS X.<p>Anyone who tells you that Macs ""just work"" and that linux takes too long to setup (or hardware isn't supported, etc) haven't used linux, and specifically ubuntu, in the last couple of years.  It does what OS X should be doing -- easy to get started, but doesn't go out of its way to shield you from advanced features.<p>Quick side rant -- OS X does in fact ""just work"" if you're doing basic to intermediate things (checking email, digital photos, etc).  As soon as you want to do something slightly advanced, it isn't the beautiful experience anymore at all -- a coworker of mine got so frustrated trying to setup PGP in mail.app that he switched to using Thunderbird.  Planning on doing any serious C development?  There's no ldd command for OS X.  Want to really tweak your terminal (see parent)?  Good luck.

To me, it seems something like this could have a societal impact on the same order-of-magnitude as the internet, yet the story only has 16 upvotes, and it will probably take over two decades, if not longer, for this manufacturing system to materialize in, for example, my neighborhood. Why is that? I realize there are certain costs to introducing it and it does have its risk (and some problems, as gibsonf1 mentioned), but wouldn't this be a marvelous investment not just financially, but in general for humankind?

Pick up the pace.  It's almost always just porky nerds who have notebooks.<p>A structured planned mentality to lifting is counter-productive.  In terms of how much and how hard to go, you really need to listen to your body on any given day.  Some times your immune system really is telling you to take it light and easy and wrap it up in fifteen minutes.<p>Also, it's most effective to dramatically vary routines and volume/intensity quite randomly from a large repertoire of exercises to prevent habituation.  This simply doesn't produce useful time series, so notes are pointless.<p>Perhaps the biggest problem with a structured and planned approach to exercise is that it's not playful.

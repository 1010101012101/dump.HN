5805087,comment,5804237,5804237,3,0,davismwfl,,,"First, just a general comment: Good companies rarely find their employees searching for a union because they take care of people and communicate often.  So the real question is if you are unhappy or have had a rash of bad employers/issues, maybe look at which vertical industry you are in or how you are selecting your next job.  Not a dig on you, just something to ponder.<p>IMO, a union would be the worst thing for our industry and profession.  Like someone else pointed out, wages are generally good, benefits are flexible and we have the ability to freely move and negotiate with any employer based on our ability and value. If knowledge workers give up the right to negotiate what is fair and equitable for them and the value they can deliver then you will see a significant number of engineers etc looking for other professions where they can still do that.<p>I do agree that there are wide ranging salaries/benefits, but it is because people all bring a different skill set, knowledge and capabilities to the table, and not everyone deserves the same pay in what we do.  We are not all assembling the same 22 parts on an assembly line with the same training and therefore deserve equal compensation.  I will happily pay a software engineer that is super talented and been in the industry for 10 years significantly more than what I would pay someone who has just gone through the motions for the last 10 years and is good but not special.  If there was a union though, I wouldn't be able to do that because every person has to fit in a pre-defined box and each person in that role gets x, y and z regardless of their value to the organization.  And over the long haul companies generally deteriorate employee morale and benefits even more when a union is introduced, because if it isn't in the union contract it won't happen.  There are some pretty awesome exceptions to that rule, but not many.<p>I have worked in software basically my entire career, and have been at companies that had significant groups of staff unionized, and a few years ago I was contracted to a company that was being unionized for the largest group of staff.  I can tell you that employees there were promised a panacea by the unions, and they finally selected one and when negotiations came down to it, the employees lost and now a fair number of them regret it.  Others are still fighting saying it was a good thing cause now everything is fair and in writing, but really all they did is take the great employees and force them to fit the mediocre box, and take the bad to mediocre employees and give them a pay and benefit increase.  Guess which ones are on which side?  I had no stake in that fight, but talked to people about both sides of the coin.  Now all discipline is equal and ""fair"".  So real example in their case, a guy that makes a minor non-critical mistake after 20 years of loyal service gets punished equally as the guy who has 1-2 years of service and bad mouths the company at every chance.  Is that fair?  I don't think so, maybe you do.<p>To be up front, I generally dislike unions, but feel they did have a place in a previous time when employers abused their employees, and in rare circumstances still do. Please don't get me wrong, people in unions are generally good, hard working people; but I feel the union itself on the other hand is only out for its own interests (not yours) and that means raising dues and collecting more money, which they do by getting higher wages and more retirement benefits etc.  Look into unions that your County governments has to deal with, look at the terms in those contracts etc.  See what it costs taxpayers.  It isn't that the people in the union are undeserving of fair treatment, but look at both sides to see what is reasonable and fair.<p>TL/DR: Unions generally suck, the stifle employee value and drive costs up on employers.",1370109587

5805074,comment,5802474,5804384,11,0,entropy_,,,"I highly doubt it. The behaviour has nothing to do with bad drivers, it's mostly because of lack of enforcement. The only thing you can get a fine for is speeding, and even then most speed traps are easy to spot. Otherwise, just do whatever the fuck you want and you won't get a fine. I'm serious, anything goes.<p>I've seen people burn red lights right in front of police officers and get no reaction. Heck, I've seen police cars burn red lights(for no reason, sirens weren't on, they were driving pretty slow, they just felt like it). I have a friend who got rear-ended by a police car and then verbally abused for being an idiot by stopping at a red light at night.<p>We didn't use to have speeding tickets a couple of year back. Then they started enforcing speed limits. Lo-and-behold people started paying attention and generally trying not to speed. But going the wrong way(even on a highway, I was once almost killed by a guy doing that because there was a traffic jam at the only exit and he didn't feel like waiting so he just U-turned and went the other way, but that's another story) will not get you fined.<p>I'm pretty sure that if traffic rules were enforced properly then people wouldn't so easily ignore them. But we don't have the necessary amount of police to even do a significant fraction of what's needed.",1370109385
5805073,comment,5804854,5804854,0,0,robomartin,,,"There are far more significant problems to solve in transportation than this.  The most significant of which, in my opinion, is working to move container transportation onto next generation land-based alternatives.<p>The fleet of container ships traversing the globe is huge.  If I remember correctly it is in the hundreds of thousands of ships.  These ships burn the most horrible fuel known to mankind: bunker fuel.  This stuff pollutes like nothing else.  The pollution created by these ships nearly dwarfs that produced by all automobiles in the world combined.  On top of that, the ships also contribute to species pollution by accidentally relocating marine fauna through their ballast tanks.  It is a horribly inefficient mode of transport screaming for a land-based solution.<p>This is where high speed rail could make a huge difference in the US.  Huge cargo only trains reaching average speeds in the 200 to 300 mph range could move all cargo from coast to coast and keep tens of thousands of container ships from going through the Panama Canal.  Power could come from nuclear, wind and solar.  Beyond that, such a project could also be leveraged to install the massive power distribution network needed to support millions of electric cars in the future.",1370109380

My wife and I are starting a company trying to help people live their dream of living in other countries and that's a very hard thing to do. You (if you're really brian) know that I write <a href=""http://www.overseas-exile.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overseas-exile.com/</a> and I've been writing that for <i>years</i> trying to help people move abroad because I love being an expat. We created this company because now we have a chance to really help people do what I'm so passionate about, but when someone tears down our work it also threatens to take away another chance for people to experience life abroad. The fact that we're doing this with IT companies is almost incidental: it's our background and it's what we know best.<p>What we <i>don't</i> do is throw CVs at a company without telling the candidate what the location and the company are like because it's important for the candidate to decide for themselves, rather than simply rely on rumors. We get to know the companies we work with so we can make sure that the candidate is happy with the company and the company is happy with the candidate. Everyone we've helped move abroad has thanked us and I don't believe anyone has any illusions that we're promising them a gold-plated Ferrari and a personal masseuse.<p>Regarding your comments about Booking.com and my reasons for leaving, people have asked and I publicly stated my reasons at <a href=""http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2011/12/moving-to-paris.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2011/12/moving-to-paris.htm...</a>. However, I was very cagey about that because much of the reason was intensely personal and nobody's darned business, but since you're attacking me by saying it's a ""sad"" thing I'm doing, I'll say it now: my wife had just had a baby, was very tired, and wanted to move back to her home country. I love my wife very dearly and I would do anything to help her. So off to France we went. Making a decision to move to another country is very hard and there are always many factors that come into play, but that was the primary reason and I've already told a few people about it privately, but I didn't shout it from the rooftops because it's nobody's business that my wife was tired and wanted to go home. Did I gripe about other issues from time to time? Sure, everyone does. But my primary motivation was my wife and daughter and it worked: my wife is very happy.<p>There are still plenty of well-known senior Perl developers who are at Booking.com: Yves, Rafael, Ævar, and many others who are known by first name to much of the community. Booking.com isn't a good fit for everyone, and not everyone is good fit for Booking.com -- that describes every business on the planet.<p>I also see that you linked to that ""truth about Booking.com"" post. I've never publicly commented on that simply because people have strong feelings about that company and just like vi versus emacs, I saw no point in wading into the debate.<p>So I'll say this about that post: that was clearly an anonymous disgruntled employee and that should be a warning sign to anyone who read it. Whoever they are, they've never been willing to stand up and take responsibility for their words, though if they're still working there, I could understand why. Their post was a mixture of truths, half-truths, and outright falsehoods. Plus, I felt there was a lot of lying by omission. Note how many Booking employees responded (all but one of whom I know personally). They were honest about the company and generally positive about it. Some people don't understand why so many extremely talented Perl developers are happy to work there, but that alone should give people pause.<p>By now most people probably know that Booking.com isn't a ""modern Perl"" shop, but they're not ""treating their employees like dogs"". They're <i>extremely</i> business-oriented and while I don't always agree with their decisions, the fact that they've managed to become one of the largest internet properties on the planet says something about what they're doing right. And if you work for them and do well, you'll get plenty of advancement opportunities if you want it. And I also know plenty of programmers working for them who have earned fantastic bonuses by producing great results. They pay a fair salary for Amsterdam, bonuses, and if you qualify for the Dutch 30% ruling, you get an extra several hundred euros a month.<p><i>TL;DR</i>: They're not for everyone, but the rumor mill is just that: a rumor factory.",1370108000

5804939,comment,5804930,5804930,4,0,norabean,,,"In case you can't view the article, here is the full txt:\nArticle by ALEXANDRA WOLFE<p>""As we try to talk by Skype, Jaan Tallinn is fading in and out on my computer screen. Sitting in his living room in Estonia, he is having trouble with his connection, which may seem ironic for a co-founder of Skype, the wildly successful video chat service. But these particular technical difficulties are not Mr. Tallinn's problem these days. Since Skype was sold for $2.6 billion in 2005, making him tens of millions of dollars, he has moved on to bigger issues—like extending the span of a healthy human life and saving the species. And those are just this spring's initiatives.<p>When the screen finally clears up, Mr. Tallinn comes into view. A youthful 41-years-old, with short blond bangs and fair skin, he could be a poster boy for his latest venture, MetaMed, which promises customers personalized health-care research and analysis of their medical conditions.<p>Health care is a relatively new focus for Mr. Tallinn, who has been interested in computer science and technology since he was 10. Born in Estonia to an architect mother and a father who directs for film and TV, he didn't get access to a computer until he was 14, when the father of one of his schoolmates selected a group of them to work in his office. There he met the friends who would eventually join him in developing Kazaa, the file-sharing application turned music-subscription service, in 2000 and then Skype in 2002.<p>He launched MetaMed last March after a $500,000 investment from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. So far, the New York-based company has about a dozen employees and 20 clients, half of them friends who are trying it pro bono. The idea emerged from another of Mr. Tallinn's goals: ""surviving as a species this century."" He has also been developing a new nonprofit called the Cambridge Project for Existential Risk with two academics.<p>What risks worry him? ""The first one is artificial intelligence,"" he says. ""The second is the things that technological progress might create that we're unaware of right now.""<p>He has just read an early draft of a book by his friend Max Tegmark, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, arguing that the only reason nuclear bombs can't be made from instructions downloaded from the Internet is that the laws of physics luckily make it hard to do. ""There's no guarantee that wouldn't be possible,"" he says, referring to homemade nuclear bombs.<p>His third fear is biological risk. ""There could be synthetic viruses that evolution doesn't even know how to create,"" says Mr. Tallinn. For all practical purposes, he suggests, evolution stopped with the advent of gene technology. ""The future of the planet depends much more on technology than evolution,"" he adds.<p>Having five children with his wife of 16 years has made many of these ideas more concrete for Mr. Tallinn. ""When somebody goes all abstract on me ... saying things like, 'Perhaps humanity doesn't deserve to survive,' I say, 'Look, do you have kids? Do you realize you're talking about the death of your kids or my kids?"" Mr. Tallinn says he's always glad to hear when technology developers have children because it makes them think in the long-term.<p>Glancing away from the screen to the trees outside his house, Mr. Tallinn laments that most people don't take these longer-term risks seriously.<p>""In general, it seems to me that people in society are bad at dealing with things that have never happened and overreact to things that have happened and happened recently,"" he says. As he notes, more people die slipping in the shower than in plane crashes, train accidents and terrorist attacks combined. ""Since 9/11, more Americans have been killed by falling furniture than by terrorists,"" says Mr. Tallinn.<p>And these, in his view, may not be humankind's only blind spots. Mr. Tallinn is open to the possibility that our lives and consciousness are all part of a computer simulation. ""As our computers and technology get better at making virtual worlds, it's reasonable to expect them to be able to create virtual worlds that are indistinguishable from the real one,"" he says. ""So if you're in a single-history universe, with one real one and many simulations, the chances of being in the simulation are higher than the real thing.""<p>If we are indeed living in a simulation, should we behave differently? ""What we should do depends on what kind of evidence we have that we are in a simulation ... and then the critical question is why the simulation is being run."" Mr. Tallinn won't say whether or not he believes we are in the real world or a computerized fake. ""Once you're in a simulation you don't even know—it could be that it's not even you.""<p>At the moment, Mr. Tallinn's virtual presence is getting fuzzy again, and his image finally fades from my screen. Calling back with his video turned off, he assures me that he is no pessimist. He looks forward to self-driving cars, which ""might completely change the logistics of civilization."" he says. With MetaMed, he's excited by the prospect of more advanced biomonitors. And then there's the possibility of cheap gene sequencing.<p>As Mr. Tallinn sees it, his career, from Skype to MetaMed to the Cambridge Project for Existential Risk, has followed a progressive arc. He recalls how he introduced himself at a recent party: ""First I saved about one million human relationships,"" with Skype, but it ""doesn't make sense to save human relationships if you don't make sure [people] live longer, and then make sure they don't get destroyed.""",1370107511

5804896,comment,5802295,5802867,7,0,mturmon,,,"Don't worry.  The comment that surprised you is not really true.  The 81k figure is for ""overtime-exempt"" employees (often just shortened to ""exempt"").  I.e., if you make less than that, you are considered ""overtime-eligible"" (opposite of exempt), and in that case, if you work more than 40 hours per week, you have to be paid overtime.  Also, the 81k figure pertains only to software people.  There <i>is</i> a figure for other occupations, but it is much lower.<p>There are also differences in how business travel is treated.  Overtime eligible employees have to be paid for all time spent in transit, but exempt do not get extra pay.  (Of course, in both cases, travel expenses will be paid by the company, I am speaking of pay for travel time.)<p>In fact, the 81k figure is a marker and not a bright line.  The actual separator between overtime eligible (""OTE"") and exempt employees considers several factors, including job responsibility and experience.<p>The OTE/exempt distinction has become more rigid in recent years because of lawsuits by attorneys representing low-paid (e.g 60k/year range) employees who had been considered ""salaried"", and asked to do extra work for free (e.g., the travel time mentioned above) because they were salaried.  These suits resulted in the distinction between OTE and exempt shifting.<p>If you ask me, it has in general hurt very early career engineers making 70k per year, because they have to account more strictly for their time than before.  For instance, they cannot redistribute their hours between work days the way salaried employees can.<p>(Only speaking of California here.)",1370107071

5804812,comment,5804258,5804258,7,0,mindcrime,,,"Part of the problem is that there's a mismatch between the education being provided and what employers need and want.  A brand new Computer Science graduate isn't usually terribly qualified to do what most employers, who hire CS graduates, want them to do, which is to write code and build programs / systems.<p>Why is this?  Well, part of it is because, as always, a liberal arts degree isn't meant to be job training in the first place.  This gap is especially pronounced with software people though, since a CS degree can be very theoretical and:  A. might teach a lot of ""stuff"" that most programmer's don't use (or don't use very often), B. doesn't always include enough of the ""stuff"" that programmer's <i>do</i> need, and C. can be overly general, when ""practice"" in this field is highly specialized and includes lots of niches.<p>Another part is because employers don't do enough to fill in the gaps and help train younger employees. Ideally, employers would hire new CS graduates and spend a year or more grooming them, teaching then the specialized skills they need in that specific domain, and helping them ramp up. But American employers are so averse to providing training, taking a long-term view, and ""playing the long game"" that it's ridiculous.<p>One thing that might help, would be if more schools started offering a <i>Software Engineering</i> degree in addition to <i>Computer Science</i> degrees, and if more students started choosing the SE degree.  But even then, again, a liberal arts degree isn't supposed to be ""job training"" and the SE degree would still probably turn into more theory and not enough ""how to actually build something"" than what employers would want.<p>Net-net, I think employers are going to have to bite the bullet at some point, and accept that you have to hire and groom ""green"" people if you want to compete.  And maybe universities should start offering a few more classes on the ""nuts and bolts"" aspects of building systems.  Perhaps some partnerships between universities and local community colleges could be involved.<p>No matter what, though, I don't think you're going to be able to look for fresh graduates who, for example, walk in the door knowing Hibernate, Spring, PostgreSQL, Camel, JMS, Lucene, Maven, Ant, JUnit, SAX, JDOM, STaX, JSON, Hadoop, etc.  But, unfortunately, employers are largely looking for folks to walk in the door ready to contribute with highly specialized skills from day one.",1370106270

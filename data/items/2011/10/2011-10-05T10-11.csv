He also makes implicit value judgements and doesn't tell you.  For instance, both phones are on AT&T and Sprint, but the Droid is marked the winner of the category because its 3rd carrier is T-Mobile while the iPhone's 3rd carrier is Verizon.<p>All the above said, as someone in the market for a phone, there are more relevant factors that are too specific to the individual for a website breakdown.  For instance, I spend 8 hours in a pre-war building with sub-optimal cell service and most of the rest of my day in the suburbs outside of 4g coverage, so 4G isn't crucial to me (but is to other people).  Similarly, how much the overall plan costs per month may determine which carrier, which has an impact on which phone.  A $10/month difference in calling plan prices is $240 over the life of the contract, swamping any difference in phone price.  Or you may need a phone which works with Linux/iTunes/whatever, which also limits your decision.  There are a lot of these factors which vary person to person and make it impossible for anyone to say which is the best phone in all circumstances for all people.",1317811948

I chose a job as a restaurant worker $8 an hour and I don't get what its point was when someone is trying to unionise the workforce and says something like ""people in low income will often avoid opportunities to better their income"" or some crap.<p>All I'm left with thinking is if your wage is <$3 from your employer, there's slim-to-nil chance you're going to unionise. Your employers response is simply FIRED, because there'll always be a dozen more people looking for a no-skill job.<p>The other things that pissed me off were the gimmicks. Like I got a speeding ticket and by contesting it in court I got charged a $40 court fee, which where I live doesn't happen. If a cop gives me a speeding ticket, it costs the police to bring the motion, not me. Furthermore my landlord increased my rent illegally and the option was ""take it"" or ""move"", and then illegally increased my rent again when a roommate moved in. What I don't get is why when I'm broke, don't have internet etc, why I wouldn't go down to the library and find out how to file a tenancy board complaint to have the guy nailed.<p>As I too ended with over $300, this was just an illustration in how stupid people make stupid decisions.

These agreements are made by the executive alone.<p>In most European countries this is a well-established legal situation, and it has been applied to no end of sordid practices, from ""bigamy"" for unemployment checks (e.g. a muslim comes into the country, works for a week, gets fired, then he and his family have the right to unemployment. 20 women come in, are ""married"" to him (but also unofficially married to someone else) and all get permanent residency and unemployment), to not applying country constitutions, or laws to their own political officials, and now extending into copyright.<p>No doubt software patents won't be far behind.<p>But this is a way lots of unconstitutional laws have been applied in the EU (in a Belgian court decision in 2003 a judge agreed that, yes, the constitution states that no laws are in effect in Belgium except those voted on by (one of the) parliaments, but it was ruled that international treaties, like all EU directives <i>override</i> the constitution).<p>Given the structure of the EU commission, this de-facto means the EU has the legal framework of a dictatorship (the EU commission is not elected) with a few local semi-democracies below it.<p>It is my hope that the EU does fall apart.",1317811773

I guess that means you need to hit a screen/hardware button when not using the headset.<p>In the Android video, most of the screens that echo back the text time out and activate without interaction.<p>Many of the interactions result in information on the screen (e.g. the detailed weather forecast, or navigating to a webpage) so there's no need to build an interface that works without a screen.<p>The difference (if there even is one, it's hard to tell from these videos alone) is less drastic than you seem to be claiming.<p>Apple's approach could well go the way of Applescript where they dress something that is fundamentally not natural language up as if it was, and while it initially seems neat in carefully controlled situations it only leads to problems in reality. Time will tell.<p>edit: just rewatched the ad, the non-screen responses are often useless e.g. Q: ""Is it going to be chilly in Napa Valley this weekend"" A: ""doesn't seem like it"", Q: ""How many cups are in 12 ounces"" A: ""Let me think. Here you go"" (displays answer as text on screen).<p>It's hidden by the editing but the woman who dictates her text clearly hits the ""I'm going to talk my phone now"" button, then says ""send"" instead of just hitting the send button that sits an inch higher (obviously this would actually make sense if you were using a headset to hit that button). Because of the editing I thought that the Apple way was smoother than the Android one which requires you to hit a button, then speak, but after a careful review it's clear the differences between the two systems regarding the need to consult/interact with the screen of the phone are mostly in the editing and/or the viewer's imagination.",1317809357

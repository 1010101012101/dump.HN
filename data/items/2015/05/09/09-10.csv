9515969,comment,9515756,9515756,0,0,atmosx,,,"Hello,<p>You need to break the problem into small steps. One step at the time. Then you <i>unify</i> the code. This is not a straight-forward process. For complex problems you might try to grab a problem from many different angles... That&#x27;s why each user on Reddit gave a different solution. Not all solutions follow the same logic... But that&#x27;s the good thing with programming, there are usually more than N solutions for each problem. Of course some are faster than others, some are <i>better</i> than others...<p>To give a practical example to the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve:<p>1. Given a text, we need to separate the words. So we do need to &#x27;split&#x27; a phrase into words.<p>2. It would be nice to have the words into an &#x27;array&#x27;. Arrays are a very handy data structures for this kind of problem.<p>3. Now we need to iterate through the words and given a word, find the consonants. In order to do that, we need to split each word in to letters.<p>4. Then we need to iterate through each letter of the word, test if it&#x27;s a consonant. How will you do that? I would create a list of consonants.. (Another Array! Too many Arrays you might think right?) and try to &#x27;match&#x27; each letter with that &#x27;array&#x27;.<p>4.1 Now if the &#x27;letter&#x27; doesn&#x27;t match with any item listed in &#x27;consonants&#x27; array, do nothing. If it does match,  substitute the consonant following the rules given from the problem.<p>6. Now we need to &#x27;join&#x27; our letters together, with our substitutions.<p>7. Then we need to join the &#x27;words&#x27; together adding spaces in between to re-form the phrase.<p>8. Then we need to print the final output.<p>That&#x27;s a first version of this program which you can optimize later on... Until you end up with something that you like.<p>Later you might add exceptions and checks. Then you might find another way to make your program iterate through each letter/word faster using an algorithm (well python will do that for you probably, I wouldn&#x27;t know as I am a ruby programmer but... I can guess it has already optimized functions for all these actions).<p>Good luck!",1431165114

9515965,comment,9515613,9515893,0,0,igravious,,,"L.E.J. Brouwer emphasized that he regarded that some mental procedures are either language-less or pre-liguistic. Intuition is an imprecisely defined notion but I think the main thing to understand is that immediacy is a key component. If we grasp something by intuition there are no steps involved. Also, I don&#x27;t think that apprehending something by intuition means proving it, proofs always involve rules and mental (or machinic) operations, in this sense knowing something by intuition is not proving that thing in the formal (or informal) sense of the word.<p>Given all that I think the Oxford dictionary&#x27;s definition is actually quite spot on.

I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;ll pick up on social cues, so he might make people in the office uncomfortable. Sometimes he doesn&#x27;t communicate well. He can&#x27;t explain what he&#x27;s thinking, and his words are a jumble. I&#x27;m not sure he could publicly speak, like give a presentation, and I sure wouldn&#x27;t want him to represent my company to customers.&quot; Is it discrimination to pass and choose another candidate who is comparable in other ways, and not hindered in those communication and interpersonal ways?",1431164995

I suppose that&#x27;s why the term exists separate from &#x27;competence&#x27; and &#x27;mastery&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;d say &#x27;grok&#x27; generally means that you truly understand something in a fundamental way, rather than just being &#x27;competent&#x27; or &#x27;masterful&#x27; at that thing. It&#x27;s a crucial step on the path to mastery, but mastery might still require a lot of practice.<p>I find &#x27;Your problem with Vim is that you don&#x27;t grok vi [1]&#x27; to be a classic example of proper usage. It explains fundamental principles of vim&#x27;s &#x27;grammar&#x27;. Once you&#x27;ve read and understood it, you &#x27;grok&#x27; vim. But even though this knowledge is crucial in being a &#x27;master&#x27;, it does not make you one. That would require a lot of practice (in this particular case, for me, a few weeks).<p>I&#x27;ve had similar experiences with functional programming. There was a point, after much reading, where I felt that I truly &#x27;grokked&#x27; the approach, but I&#x27;m still far away from being a master at functional programming.

Watching video is fine as long as disk read speed greater than video stream bitrate. Music does not require that either. When you download huge archive, you don&#x27;t need high write speed, HDD write speed will be more than enough, it&#x27;s probably higher than network speed anyway.<p>Unless SSD will become better than HDD by all parameters, HDD&#x27;s are very suitable as part of disk setup for anyone who need more than 200 GB data. And there are millions of people who don&#x27;t use all that cloud things and prefer to download, store and watch/listen their content locally.",1431162485

More specifically:<p>* Do you write the code or just &#x27;compile it on your mind&#x27; and go?<p>* Do you re-read the same chapter over and over again if you feel that you missed something, or you go forward even if you feel something is missing?<p>* Do you do all the exercises listed at the end of every chapter (this doesn&#x27;t apply to every book, but most programming books do have exercises)<p>I&#x27;m curious, because usually by 50% of the book I feel that I can do <i>everything</i> I wanna do and my attention drops. I just wanna start my project using book&#x27;s X framework/language.<p>ps. I&#x27;m generally speaking a <i>slow reader</i>. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I literally read &#x27;slow&#x27; and it bothers me speeding up my <i>natural reading rhythm</i> but it also bothers me the fact that my GF usually finished the page/article while I&#x27;m still in the middle. On the positive note, I read much more carefully most of the times. I&#x27;ve seen people here stating that they read Flanagan&#x27;s JS book in 5 days... Which to me seems kinda impossible (if you have no prior DEEP knowledge of JS and OO programming).<p>Regards :-)",1431162391

Recovery of one pitot occurred at 02:10:36, and the other at around 02:11:03. That's about 30 seconds to recover one pitot, and 57 seconds to the recovery of the second. When you consider that this all boils down to melting off ice, that's not so bad, really. And if they hadn't royally screwed up their manual handling, it wouldn't have downed the plane - there is, in fact, a procedure for maintaining safe lift when airspeed indications are lost; somehow the copilots in command managed to screw it up, and continued to screw up even after the pitots recovered. The BBC tried replicating a pitot failure in a simulator, and when the sim pilots went by the proper procedure, there was no problem: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=JqTPbPlyX5E#t=545s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v...</a><p>So basically, this is human error, but exacerbated by a lack of training in cruise problems and poor feedback from the controls when the copilots gave conflicting commands.",1323320392

3327698,comment,3327232,3327426,1,0,wcarss,,,"Good point about efficiency gains becoming a more direct incentive; I look forward to it. However, I doubt that optimization would trend solely toward high capacity vehicles - think of taxis airport taxis as two classes of hireable fare, divided into single user single destination and multiple user single destination. What we need is a multiple user multiple destination system.<p>Taxis are for in-city travel and occasionally nearby inter-city travel, and the regular car has ended up being fine. They do have a few larger vehicles for big groups, but those are special case vehicles. On average, they tend to get 1-2 people at a time wanting to go places.<p>Airport taxis tend to be closer to a commute-oriented vehicle. Several people are going from here to somewhere else, so they tend toward 5-6 person vehicles which operate through the night on >1hour long trips.<p>Corporate transit systems like Microsoft's Connect system are essentially multi-user multi-destination. Those make buses make sense, but there are a relatively small number of buses making set route transfers while a hive of taxis provides last-mile service.<p>The ""Future of Transportation"" article from a few days ago [1] suggests that the average vehicle has 1.2 people in it, and that apparently takes commuters into account. Now we must consider: will behaviour change to increase carpooling?<p>Specifically, what is presently preventing people more people from taking buses to work? (lots do take buses and trains already, but many people drive 10 to 100 minutes)<p>It could be that a bus doesn't get you /right/ to work. It could be that you would never think to contact everyone in your neighbourhood and figure out that you could buy a bus and run it just for you guys. It could be that the cost of owning and using a car is just low enough that it doesn't really save you anything. It could be an aesthetic sense of independence.<p>My bet is that this will work out like Microsoft's system. Major transit routes can scale passenger levels up and move efficiently between well placed bus-station/pickup hubs, and armies of taxis will shuttle you to your final destination. Google's bikes are nice, but last-mile service will have to deal with a broader sprawl. Most of them will be focused on getting from hub to delivery and vice versa during morning and evening, but then, what happens during the day? Even weirder: what happens at night?<p>1. <a href=""http://swiftprt.com/blog/2011/12/the-future-of-ground-based-transportation-systems/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swiftprt.com/blog/2011/12/the-future-of-ground-based-...</a>",1323318959

3327604,comment,3327202,3327202,115,0,runningdogx,,,"I've followed the discussion of the AF447 investigation on several flight discussion forums.<p>The PF (Bonin) apparently never became aware of his angle of attack (once the airplane fully stalled, AOA was absurdly high).  He did not seem to be aware that his constant inputs had caused the Airbus's THS (trimmable horizontal stabilizer, horizontal flaps on the tail) to deflect to maximum in order to try to keep the nose up.  Therefore when he tried to input stick up (nose down) several times briefly, and there was no obvious response (the computer takes a while to reduce THS elevation in response to opposing input), who knows what he thought -- maybe that all readings were incorrect.<p>Strangely, Bonin was the one pilot who had significant recent glider experience as I recall.  The Airbus computer even in ""alternate law"" functions nothing like a glider (only ""direct law"" is sort of close to direct input), so maybe that further confused him.<p>In my opinion, at night, over an ocean, in a storm, with no visibility, in possibly significant turbulance, a modern aircraft cutting off Autopilot for any reason other than computer failure is completely unacceptable.  A computer should be able to fly as well as a human under those circumstances.<p>People suggesting that on airliner forums get flamed.  But it's true.  Most pilots kept up the refrain that a computer cannot safely fly by gps and gyros unless they also have airspeed.  Which is true.  It's dangerous to fly if you don't have true airspeed (gyros and gps cannot accurate provide relative wind speed).  However, if pitot tubes are frozen and the computer no longer has valid airspeed, the pilots no longer have valid airspeed either.  Pitch and power is all they can do.  The computer can do that just as well.  All it needs to know is aircraft weight, which can be entered (maybe it is entered) before takeoff and automatically adjusted to account for fuel consumption.<p>There are a bunch of factors that contributed to the accident:<p>Pitots shouldn't have frozen.<p>Lack of Air France training for controlling an aircraft at altitude with the computer in ""alternate law"" (mode without full flight envelope protection; it's therefore possible to stall).<p>The command structure in the cockpit without the Captain (who had just gone on break) actually had Bonin in command, even though the co-pilot in the left seat outranked him... AF has since changed that.  CRM (crew resource management) was poor; the co-pilot in the left seat didn't try to take control until way too late.  The co-pilot was preoccupied with where the Captain was rather than offering constructive input on how to fly.<p>Bonin was not adequately aware of what his inputs were doing, or what the plane's Angle of Attack was, and did not react properly to the stall warning which in almost every case at high altitude means drop the nose, not raise it (though without valid airspeed there's a risk of overspeed which can cause a new set of problems).<p>The Airbus computers had some quirks; stall warnings stop if airspeed drops too low (due to some computer programming logic involving low airspeed, AOA sensors, and the result being silencing the stall warnings).<p>Nobody believed a passenger aircraft would be so stable during a full stall.  This undoubtedly contributed to confusion about whether they were actually stalled.  The Airbus's computer setting the trimmable horizontal stabilizer to max nose-up deflection, in response to Bonin's almost constant nose-up input, possibly contributed to the stability during stall.<p>Angle of Attack information may not have been adequately displayed to the PF (Bonin) -- the black box doesn't record data from the right set of instruments, so nobody knows what Bonin had on his screen.<p>There was poor notification on the co-pilot's side of what the PF (Bonin) was doing.  Unlike traditional aircraft, it is not easy to see what the pilot in the other seat is doing with the stick.<p>There was poor notification on either side of the cockpit when the other pilot took control.  When the co-pilot took control, Bonin almost immediately took control back, and it's not clear either of them knew what the other was trying to do.  Apparently there's a light that indicates override, but who would notice such things under that amount of stress?<p>IOW, it was a disaster from top to bottom.  Usually in aircraft accidents there's a chain of events, but in this case there were so many possible contributing causes that other than having better pitots that didn't freeze over, solving any one other problem may not have broken the chain.",1323317433

An important aspect of cockpit resource management is to know who is controlling the airplanes, and part of that is always positively verbally transferring control, with confirmation.

I committed to and completed three projects and nothing ever came of them.  Thankfully it only amounted to ~1000 hours among the three projects, but it's still time I wasn't paid for.<p>A technical co-founder with no work experience doesn't sound like much of a ""technical"" co-founder.  Has he worked on any sort of open source projects, done research at a university, or anything that could be considered experience?  If not, then it's not a good sign.<p>If you can afford to spare the time, then by all means take the opportunity, but I'd ask for 33% and wouldn't settle for less than 25%.  Just state that you feel you'd be playing an important role in the product's creation and expect a more equitable share.  You're allowed to put any price you want on your time.  If they're confident the venture will succeed, then they should relinquish some of their share, otherwise they're being a bit greedy.",1323316882

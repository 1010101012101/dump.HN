The only ones not being acquired are those who have the ambition to be giants themselves (Dropbox, Snapchat), it seems this was not the goal of Oculus. So now it&#x27;ll just become another tentacle of the Facebook Empire.<p>Although I guess this is how most other businesses operate too. Finding a hit product allows you to become a multi-millionaire, but if you want to become a billionaire you have to have conviction as well. (Which has considerable risk as you might be killed. I can certainly imagine myself selling out when a billion-dollar deal is on the table, so I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad move to sell out, it&#x27;s just sort of sad)",1395784301

They&#x27;re slapping together a bunch of Spring components to make some dull business app while waiting for 5pm to roll around so they can escape the tedium of that dreadful existence.<p>Average programmers don&#x27;t learn Java because they&#x27;re deeply interested in increasing the quality of their craft. They learn Java because it&#x27;s what they were taught in school and/or because it will get them a job most easily. The bottom 80% of the programmer bell curve really doesn&#x27;t give a shit about what kind of tools they use, as long as it keeps them employed.<p>When you get to programmers who really <i>love</i> programming, who want to write the best code possible and are willing to go out of their way to learn tools with very little chance of landing them that next corporate job, you&#x27;re most likely in that top 20% already. So anyone who has learned Clojure, or at least can explain rationally why someone <i>would want to</i> learn Clojure (ie understands the benefits of functional programming), is <i>probably</i> not a benchwarmer idiot.<p>As a hiring founder who has absolutely zero interest in hiring below that top 20% (really, below the top 5%, ideally the top 1%), and has limited time to peruse a thousand basically identical resumes, applying a filter that gets rid of 80% of potential applicants is a Good Thing.",1395783957

The &quot;gcutil&quot; command line tool is more intuitive, Google&#x27;s Cloud Console is more responsive than the AWS console, the general performance is better (especially disk and startup time), Compute supports live migration of running VMs (avoid downtime), and finally Compute bills by the minute, not the hour, so you can spin up a bunch of high-spec VMs for a quick test without running up big charges (I got a little burned by this with EC2, in the past).",1395783837

You could get equivalent gaming performance by buying two of the GTX 780 Ti for about $1500.  That level of performance is roughly what you want if you want to game at 4k resolutions at 60 FPS, so there are gaming applications for this card, even if it falls into &quot;insanely high-end&quot;.  The niche for this sort of card is in mini-ITX and similarly small computers, where there isn&#x27;t enough room for a pair of cards and the builder wants &quot;throwing money away&quot; levels of performance.<p>That said, the selling point of the Titan cards is that their GPUs don&#x27;t have the same restrictions put on their general-purpose compute performance as the standard gamer cards.  NVIDIA locks this performance on their geforce cards in order to protect their lucrative GPGPU business, so this is really more of an entry-level card for scientific computing and other applications.<p>Cryptocurrency mining would be an obvious application, but a quirk of NVIDIA and AMD&#x27;s differing architectures means that AMD cards are vastly more powerful at the specific functions needed to mine cryptocoins.",1395783042

7468965,comment,7466711,7467814,11,0,ANTSANTS,,,"You saw them a lot in old games (the kind likely to be written in assembly), because not even C, let alone a general-purpose scripting language, was acceptable for performance reasons for quite some time, yet there has always been a need for greater abstraction and expressive power. Look at any Japanese RPG of the 80s and 90s, for instance, and there&#x27;s probably a simple bytecode VM (or state machine, if you prefer) for scripts that move characters around during story sequences, one for displaying text in menus and dialogs, and so on. Look in an arcade shooter, and there&#x27;s probably one for defining enemy movement patterns, etc. Tiny bytecode DSLs not only boosted expressive power for programmers, they also allowed non-programmers to script behavior. 6502 assembly might be out of reach for non-programmers, but `SETANIM PLAYER1 PLAYER_WALK_TICK; WAIT 20; SETANIM PLAYER1 PLAYER_WALK_TOCK; WAIT 20; LOOP;` is not. If you only have to remember a few simple rules to get the behavior you want, even learning to hand-assemble bytecode is not out of the question for a dedicated professional.<p>Nowadays, you&#x27;d probably be better served by embedding a general-purpose dynamic language in most of these scenarios, but hand-rolled bytecode can still win in certain situations that <i>need</i> high performance and/or low latency. Imagine, for instance, one of those fancy &quot;danmaku&quot; shooters with hundreds or even thousands of bullets on screen moving in intricate patterns. You just might want a language more dynamically manipulable than C to script the behavior of those bullets, but using a dynamic language that furiously generates garbage and demands collection pauses for something that <i>must</i> happen 60 frames per second on so many objects is probably going to cause hitches eventually that <i>will</i> get your player killed (in the game, at least). You&#x27;ll then be subject to a very harsh but valid criticism: &quot;I played games like this on my PlayStation back in the day with no slowdown, this guy must be a crappy programmer if his 2D game stutters on my monster PC.&quot; Sure, it&#x27;s great that you don&#x27;t need to break out the optimized assembly to do a Breakout clone anymore, but at the same time, <i>you should feel bad</i> if a 1Mhz 6502 provides a considerably more reliable experience than your game on a modern x86.<p>A certain popular 2D shooter series made by an ex-Taito arcade game programmer uses a bytecode DSL for its intricate bullet patterns for this reason. It was probably an easier decision to make when the series started in the late 90s, but today it lets the author be productive without adding wildly variable latency into the mix that would kill the gameplay. People should not forget that running smoothly even on poor hardware is a real feature. Even in 2014, I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of people out there still using Pentium 4s and Windows XP. If you make the only new games/apps/whatever that run well on these computers, you have a captive audience.<p>At the same time, I think you could extract 99% of the performance benefits of the bytecode approach if your language had a well-defined heapless, stackless &quot;tasklet/microthread&quot; subset that centered around mutating existing objects and making certain limited kinds of allocations (allocating from a memory pool and manually &quot;freeing&quot; by marking the object as unused later). Knowing that a piece of code will never generate garbage and that a garbage collection cycle will never happen during its execution makes a huge difference.",1395781570

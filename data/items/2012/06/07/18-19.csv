4080709,comment,4079977,4080488,2,0,jedbrown,,,"Unsalted was not ""state of the art"" in the 1970s. The database would be far more secure if it had used a weaker hash with salt.<p>To migrate, Unix-like systems generally support database migration through a modular format (see ""man pam_unix"" and /etc/pam.d/passwd). The next time the password is changed, the field that looks like $1$<salt>$<md5hashedpasswd> will be converted to $6$<salt>$<sha512hashedpasswd>. I guess you could change it at the next login if you allowed modification to the password table during login. If you were eager, you could just salt and rehash the hashes current hashes. To check that password, you would do the old unsalted md5, then apply the salt and sha512 (or whatever) before checking in the database.",1339095546

4080694,comment,4079934,4080634,2,0,mtgx,,,"Google could've really used a similar approach for tablet apps. I find Google's lack of attention towards Android tablet apps very frustrating. It's one of the main reasons, if not <i>the</i> main reason why Android tablets are generally still not considered very good competitors to the iPad. And if the situation really is better than we think its, then they are doing a very poor job at promoting it. This, plus the botched launch of Honeycomb and the expensive tablets running it, really hurt the momentum for Android tablets, and they are still suffering for it.<p>Google needs to learn how to do launches properly, and they should keep in mind that developer support from day one is extremely important. Apple had like 2000 apps for the iPad in the first days or weeks after launch, because they announced the tablet 2 months ahead, and made the SDK available right away, too. And made the iPhone developers very excited about porting their apps to the iPad. In contrast, Google released the SDK like literally a day before the Motorola Xoom launched (which cost $800 at launch - another extremely dumb move. Asus Transformer was $400 a few months later, and a better device, too), and then everyone started talking about the lack of tablet apps on Honeycomb. Would it have killed them to get the developer support <i>before</i> launch, like Apple? I get really frustrated when I see Google making obvious mistake after obvious mistake like this.",1339095430

4080687,comment,4080074,4080074,5,0,simba-hiiipower,,,"""...the selling and downloading of song files is a vestigial consumer behavior leftover from the physical media era. Consumers are still transitioning out of the idea of 'owning' their music, and downloads happened to be that natural and convenient next step in the 'digital' age. But the clouds are forming, and the storm is bound to rain (apologies for the blatant metaphor). Between Youtube, blogs and Spotify, you can already find just about any song you could possibly want to hear. Anecdotally I hear more and more kids who cant be bothered to download anymore - the gratification is so much more instant on YouTube. Increasingly, the main value of buying or pirating an MP3 these days is that its a mode of cataloguing a personal music library (and sloppy one at that). Even this distinction is eroding under the increasing maturation of cloud music.""<p>People have been saying this for years and it hasnt happened and I still dont see it happening anytime soon. I think this type of analysis is flawed on multiple levels, but in particular in how it looks at consumers as a whole.<p>Looking at the industry post-2000, the way I see it is people tend to fall into one of two buckets as music downloaders: (1) people who tend to discover and consume music passively (i.e. hear a song on the radio, download the single for repeat enjoyment), and (2) people who actively discover and consume music (i.e. discover a new artist, download their album to hear more).<p>Regarding bucket (1), Id say the post is pretty spot-on. These consumers, who Id easily say make up the majority in the market, are switching towards platforms that deemphasize ownership, and thus render sales from iTunes and the like obsolete. But these people never really wanted to own the content in the first place; I agree with the post that, for them, ownership was just the more natural and convenient option to consumption.<p>But for bucket (2), I dont see this type of transition occurring. These people werent just downloading content as a means to enjoy it; the process of discovering, downloading, building-out a collection, and being able to play-back from an exact catalogue of music you like is all part of the experience. For these consumers one of the values of a platform is the ability to get all the music they want and enjoy it exactly as they chose. These consumers may not be as numerous as those in bucket (1), but putting aside the means of download (i.e. iTunes sales may be mostly singles downloaded by bucket (1), but Id guess a larger portion of total digital music downloads across the web come from bucket (2) with torrents and the like included), they represent the majority of the digital music market. And 'platforms' like Pandora, Spotify, YouTube (if you can even consider it as adequate at all in this context), and others will never replace the ability to build a personal collection.<p>iTunes may become obsolete soon enough as the less intensive consumers switch to such platforms as described, and the whole system of managing a collection may move to the cloud as well, but I dont see the act of downloading and maintaining a personal music collection in general going anywhere.",1339095377

4080685,comment,4080074,4080594,8,0,freshbreakfast,,,"The ""music industry"" is whatever the market and enabling technology defines it to be.  Before the 1950's, selling sheet music defined the ""music industry"" for decades.  Before that, patronage by European royalty defined the ""music industry"".<p>But I agree that at the heart of this ""experience"" is the music itself, and the performance that manifests it.  But I still feel music is beyond the products that have defined it as a record industry.  Music is a primordial organizing principle of human societies, always has been.  In a lot of ways, I think these future direct-to-fan experiential products return music to the primordial function it served for humanity, and all that entails.  And sure, selling it seems sort of cheesy now, but that's a zeitgeist sentiment, which can and will change.  Remember, 70-100 years ago, it was cheesy to sell recorded music.  Lot of world renowned musicians, orchestras and performers refused to be recorded, for some of the same sentiments you share here today about ""BS 'experience'"" products.",1339095361

This is also where callbacks for things like button clicks live<p>* You can use sqlite on Android, but there isn't anything like the Django ORM built-in<p>* SharedPreferences can act as a key-value store for small data (sort of like Redis I suppose)<p>If you can expose all of your app's functionality through an API, then you can just treat the Android app as an API client.

Those services were almost as universally reviled as Spotify is currently lauded.<p>The truly unfortunate thing, for my listening habits at least, is that  finding what I want on Spotify is always a crap shoot. They may have it and they may not. What I end up doing at the moment is paying $10 / mo for Spotify premium (primarily because I hate their ads and genuinely prefer the higher audio quality on my home stereo system). and end up supplementing with another $10 / mo in iTunes bills to buy the songs that aren't available on Spotify.<p>While I do enjoy the ""instant gratification"" of Spotify and the ability to get an ""all-in-one"" package, people's expectations and habits around music consumption are fundamentally different than other forms of media in that music is primarily a passive experience with reading or watching television / film content are both very active experiences.

I know you don't <i>need</i> blend, but you can't just go in and add a single line to change the color of an invalid toolbox border--the alternative to blend is to (afaik) copy the entire style resource that the element uses from MSDN, dig into it to find the appropriate 10 lines of useless markup that surround one word property.<p>CSS is infinitely more simple than XAML style resources.<p>I'm also very partial to the pseudo separation of concerns where HTML is for semantics, and CSS is for style, and JS is for effects.

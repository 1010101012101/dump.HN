Pity that the high phytate content of whole grains binds to minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, significantly reducing their absorption by the body[6-8]. While they increase the dietary content of zinc, iron, magnesium and calcium when compared to refined grains, they also promptly increase the excretion of these minerals from the body. The end result is that overall mineral status improves only marginally, remains unchanged, or even worsens[7-12]. If you want to increase your mineral intake, whole grains are a pretty poor way to do it. Far better choices would be fresh non-cereal, non-leguminous plant foods, mineral-rich waters (look for a high magnesium:calcium ratio), ionic mineral solutions such as those sourced from Utahs Great Salt Lake, and highly bioavailable mineral supplements such as those complexed to citrate, picolinate, etc.</i><p>I will not. :-)",1311206014

2787770,comment,2786066,2786066,3,0,ghoul2,,,"The blog post provides some fascinating data, thanks Backblaze!<p>$2100 per month for an entire rack worth of Pods (space, power, connectivity)
$74,000 is the cost to build 10 Pods to fill that rack.
If the Pods are assumed to have a lifetime of 3 years (most will last longer, but lets depreciate at this rate), and if the cost of capital is 20%/year, this equates to a monthly ""payment/amortization"" cost of $2750. Thus leading to a total cost per rack of $4850 ~ lets say $5000.<p>1350TB of <i>raw</i> storage is provided by this rack, which can be scaled to 13/15 to account for RAID6 (as revealed by brianwski here) - thus leaving 1170TB available for use. FS overhead etc, lets take this to provide 1PB of storage.<p>So, essentially, storage <i>costs</i> backblaze about 0.5 <i>cents</i> ($0.005) /GB-month. There are other costs ofcourse, Sean (amongst others) needs to get paid, etc. To go by a common thumb rule, for a minimum sale price, one third of sale price should be profit, another third should be org expenses/marketing/everything else and the remaining third should be the actual cash cost of the building/providing the product/service.<p>So very roughly, Backblaze could provide storage at about 1.5 cents /GB-month. Factor in 3-way software-level redundancy of data, and you are now upto 5 cents/GB-months for a very high quality storage service.<p>Contrasting this with 15c/GB-month that Amazon charges (in addition to transfer charges), I do have to wonder why Backblaze wants to stick to the ""unlimited desktop backups"" business. Even Google storage charges 17c/GB-month, in addition to per-request charges.<p>Its quite possible I have some factors wrong here and If anyone can spot anything wrong, I'd like to know. Nevertheless, it seems from the numbers provided that backblaze could make a killing in this market. I know I would be interested in using a pure storage backend - equivalent to S3. I use tarsnap and if tarsnap could reduce its backend costs by two-thirds, I know I'd be very happy.<p>What am I missing?<p>edit: wrote PB instead of TB. Numbers remain correct, though",1311203113

It would be fun to sue for massive amounts one of the fake users and then the company that generated would be liable:))) If ever proven so through.",1222559837
317262,comment,317170,317259,0,0,aneesh,,,"Yes, we got the joke.  But suppose in 50 years we come up with a cool technology that is so good it drives cell phone penetration down to 1% (ie young people growing up then never buy cell phones).  Then cell phones can make a comeback and double to 2%.  And double <i>again</i> to 4%, etc.",1222559800
317261,comment,316886,317119,0,0,Eliezer,,,"I don't object to ""backpropagation"" aka gradient descent, which is a bit of simple calculus-based optimization.  What I object to is the widespread public perception that saying ""neural networks"" is a brilliant new paradigm-overthrowing Key to General Intelligence, after over three damn decades.<p>Biologically inspired stuff?  I applaud it to the extent that it works.  It's not a magic key to anything, and it doesn't avert the challenge of understanding.",1222559783

317259,comment,317170,317195,0,0,rocha,,,"It depends on the unit that is doubling. From how I read the claim, Peter Norvig is using penetration percentage as such unit. Once you reach 50%, doubling means 100%, which is very unlikely since it is almost certain that somewhere in the world there is someone that does not use certain technology (meaning writing, clothing, radio, cellphones or whatever...). In short: the claim is just a clever joke :)",1222559695

An interesting coincidence is that the power itself, 43,112,609, is also prime.<p>The definition given by the improper formatting of numbers in the article: (2 * 43,112,609) - 1 = 86225217 = 3 * 13 * 2210903 and so is not prime.",1222557638
317241,comment,317155,317219,0,0,rms,,,"This idea that neutrality is something to strive for ends up marginalizing the correct point of view by giving equal time to the opposing point of view. In this case, the correct answer is obvious, that gay marraige should be permitted at the federal level. Being neutral about gay marriage is like being neutral about evolution -- it only ends up making the creationists look more legitimate. They don't deserve any attention or neutrality. In this case, Google has no bias because they are right.",1222557493

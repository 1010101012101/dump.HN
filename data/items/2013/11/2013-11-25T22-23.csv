6797697,comment,6797697,6797575,14,0,cocoflunchy,,,"Actual memo:<p>Hello Yahoos,\nEarlier this year we asked you to move to Yahoo Mail for your corporate email account. 25% of you made the switch (thank you). But even if we used the most generous of grading curves (say, the one from organic chemistry), we have clearly failed in our goal to move our co-workers to Yahoo Mail.\nIt’s time for the remaining 75% to make the switch. Beyond the practical benefits of giving feedback to your colleagues on the Mail team, as a company it’s a matter of principle to use the products we make. (BTW, same for Search.)\nFor some reading this email, you are saying, “Jeff, shut up, you had me at hello.” <i>hug</i> Jump over to yo/dogfood, click “Corp Mail/Cal/ Messenger” and you are ready to join our brave new world at yo/corpmail or <a href=\"https://mail.yahoo-inc.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mail.yahoo-inc.com</a>.\nFor others, you might now be running in your head to a well worn path of justified resistance, phoning up the ol’ gang, circling the hippocampian wagons of amygdalian resistance. Hold on a sec, pilgrim.\nFirst, it doesn’t feel like we are asking you to abandon some glorious place of communications nirvana. At this point in your life, Outlook may be familiar, which we can often confuse with productive or well designed. Certainly, we can admire the application for its survival, an anachronism of the now defunct 90s PC era, a pre-web program written at a time when NT Server terrorized the data center landscape with the confidence of a T-Rex born to yuppie dinosaur parents who fully bought into the illusion of their son’s utter uniqueness because the big-mouthed, tiny-armed monster infant could mimic the gestures of The Itsy-Bitsy Pterodactyl. There was a similar outcry when we moved away from Outlook’s suite-mates in the Microsoft Office dreadnaught. But whether it’s familiarity, laziness or simple stubbornness dressed in a cloak of Ayn Randian Objectivism, the time has come to move on, commrade [sic...go deep in this pun, it is layered].\nUsing corp mail from the Y Mail web interface is remarkably feature rich. It supports booking conference rooms, folders, calendar, filters and global address book. Plus, you get built-in Messenger, smart conversation threading, powerful keyboard shortcuts, the new quick actions, attachment preview and our beautiful new rich themes. In the rare case you do need Outlook, like adding a delegate for your calendar, you can still fire up Outlook for 30 seconds.\nBut wait there’s more. By using corporate Mail, you’ll automatically get to dogfood our new features first. I’m especially excited about a new feature premiering in just a few more days: smart auto-suggest, powered by a platform from the still-have-that-new-acquisition-smell Xobni team. We have been testing this feature with select users in and out of the company and the response has been fantastic: “Whoa!”, “Amazing”, “Already in love with it. Woot!” and, my favorite, “So nicely integrated that it appears as if it’s always been there. I already can’t imagine it not being there again.”\nFeeling that little tingle? Take a deep breath, you can do this. We want you on board, sailor!\nPlease note, on the mobile side, corp mail is not yet supported in our Mail app for Android or iOS, but that will change (PB&J!). And, like all dogfood offerings, there is a feedback link in the product. Use it generously so we can make the improvements to make Yahoo Mail the unquestioned inbox champion of the world. I pitty [sic] the fool who resists.\nThanks for your support. It really does matter and we appreciate it.\nJeff Bonforte, SVP Communications Products\nRandy Roumillat, CIO",1385420117

It feels like they are punching themselves when walking forward. Their current goal is to provide a comfortable integrated experience.

Totalitarian eugenics was the zeitgeist among the progressives of the 1930s and 40s, growing directly from the just-recently-settled implications of Darwin; and America, as in many other intellectual movements in the 19th and 20th centuries, was one of the central participants in the discourse.<p>However, we never <i>did</i> any eugenics. We <i>thought</i> about it: explored, in all its Consequentialist glory, every facet of the avenues available to us at the time; had our strategists and think-tanks outline hard-nosed evaluations of the pros and cons of such actions; but, then as now, it never came to anything. There was no top-down governmental push to <i>force</i> sterilization, or death, by active selection from the population. And as far as I can tell, with the way the US government is designed, there <i>could</i> be no such push; there isn&#x27;t an arm of the government from which it could legitimately originate.<p>Even without the Nazi example to reflect upon, the deepest into depravity the American system would likely have sunk would be something like sterilizing entrants into our dystopian prisoner-industrial complex. :)<p>---<p>Seperately, I must just point out, your last paragraph reeks of Reactionism[1] -- just because we <i>were</i> wrong, does not mean that we will be wrong <i>in perpetuity</i>, and there is no reason to flinch away from even <i>evaluating the consequences</i> of things like eugenics when those consequences are constantly changing alongside advances in technology.<p>There may come a point where there will be no negative consequences at all -- a point when, say, a mother can just take a pill to ensure that from then on she will conceive completely genetically-healthy children. To flinch away at <i>that</i> point would be madness. The question is, how close must we be before flinching away is not madness, but just sub-optimal in the net-present-value of global DALY[2]?

But, you can remove a lot of your dependence on luck by getting better at the game over time, as well as by playing a lot.  Just ask anyone that plays Texas Hold&#x27;em.<p>Want to score more? Get your number of shots on goal up. Luck is just the positive result of chance being realized.  Chance to succeed vs chance to fail. So as long as you don&#x27;t care about the number of failures you stack up, you just keep rolling the dice until you succeed.<p>Perseverance is sufficient as long as it is accompanied by adaptability.  You simply need the ability to recognize your strengths/weaknesses/personality type and play the game accordingly.  Either invest in improving your weaknesses, or spend time networking to find a partner to complement them. Even better, pick an idea where your weaknesses will not be a factor.<p>What makes startups so hard is all the opportunities to fail that come along as you try and build something new.  Every month, or every week, there is a new thing that wants to kill you.  Sometimes these things have nothing to with the company.  But, there are sooo many ways to mitigate these problems and you learn how to do so better and better the longer you play the game.<p>If you&#x27;d like me to go into some more personal details to show some examples, just let me know.<p>Edited: minor edits.",1385418325

Bob goes to buy house insurance and they can predict with certainty that he&#x27;ll eventually get $400,000 paid out (presumably because his house got destroyed somehow) while Steve is predicted to have nothing paid out.<p>If the insurance company has access to these predictions, they will naturally charge Bob about $400,000, plus a profit margin, while they&#x27;ll charge Steve next to nothing. In this situation, insurance policies become nothing more than elaborate savings accounts.<p>On the other hand, if the clients have access to these predictions, Bob will buy the best policy he can find, while Steve will naturally not buy any policy. In this scenario, insurance companies all go out of business instantaneously because it becomes impossible to make any money, or even break even.<p>Yet both sides have huge incentives to try to approximate these scenarios as best they can. The better insurance companies can predict people&#x27;s insurance usage, the more profitable they can be. The better clients can predict their own usage, the less they spend. But let both parties achieve their predictive goals and the whole thing falls apart utterly.<p>Medical science is driving relentlessly toward that goal, to the extent that many people were being shut out. The ACA tries to attack both sides of it, by preventing insurance companies from charging differing prices based on certain predictive information, and by preventing clients from refusing to purchase the product.

The filesystem should be interacting with the VFS layer using <i>runes</i> (Unicode codepoints), not octets.<p>And then, given that all filesystems route through the VFS, it can (and should) be enforcing preconditions on those runes in <i>its</i> API, expecting users to pass it something like a printable_rune_t[]. (Or even, horror of Pascalian horrors, a <i>struct containing a length-prefixed</i> printable_rune_t[].)<p>And for the situation where there&#x27;s now files floating around without a printable_rune_t[] name -- this is why NTFS has been conceptually based around GUIDs (really, NT object IDs) for a decade now, with all names for a file just being indexed aliases.

Other people see what happened to the bad driver, and modify their behavior accordingly.<p>People who have pre-existing health conditions are not immediately taken out of the pool of people who are healthing (i.e. euthanized). There is no alternative to living. If they don&#x27;t get insurance - or it&#x27;s harder for them to get insurance - they go on living, with increased misery, until the costs hit everybody with trips to the emergency room. It is very unclear whether that example will influence others to be more healthy - most diseases are effectively random, or strike with the kinds of probabilities that most humans are bad at integrating into their decisions. Even alcoholism has a component of genetic predisposition, and some people might even become addicted as children.<p>This is, of course, setting aside the moral argument, but this is is HN.",1385416833

2981759,comment,2978027,2978398,4,0,spacemanaki,,,"> Cyberpunk is largely an expression of fears about an Asian (Japanese more often than not) ""takeover"" of Western society. It's actually very xenophobic but it does reflect the dystopian fears of the time. Cyberpunk has waned in recent years as the xenophobia has and the realization that this isn't the future.<p>This is way off base, and really does a disservice to those authors. Cyberpunk in the 80s may have inherited some economic xenophobia but there were a lot of other ideas in there that I think were more important and continue to be, around the internet and technology.<p>It also hasn't waned the way you describe. The Deus Ex games are examples of cyberpunk that doesn't have as much to do with Asian takeovers of Western society as Neuromancer or Snow Crash perhaps does. Aside from the technological themes, the demons are thoroughly all-American: media propaganda, military contractors, corporate regulation, big scary government, war on terror, police actions... I would argue a lot of that came from the dystopias envisioned by sci-fi in the 80s, some of it from the cyberpunk authors.<p>I agree about Neuromancer being fairly average in quality, and that CJ Cherryh should be on the list.",1315670092

The typical response is ""I don't really care. I just want to do x"". Try selling them on spending a $1000+ on a computer that will only last 3-4 years. They don't see the value proposition and, for those that do, will buy an Apple product because of the brand image. The PC has lost the high end for almost a decade now and I don't think they can get it back. This, along with Apple dominating the supply chain, makes it difficult to compete.",1315669931

Where is this based out of?  I went through the web site and it doesn't seem to mention this.  Is he really who he says he is?  A 17-year old who built a sophisticated web site in 1 week by himself?  Why did he say that he built the web site himself, but in the blog of bitcoinica, it's written as ""we""?<p>2) Why do they deposit everyone's money into a single account?  Who owns this account?  How do they keep track of everyone's money?  REAL brokerages have people's money in segregated accounts, meaning that the brokerage firm CAN'T TOUCH THE MONEY even if they collapse.  How do we know they won't one day turn around, transfer the money to China or Singapore and disappear?  How do we know this isn't another Madoff case?<p>3) How the heck does he afford to give everyone 5:1 margin?  The simple story of using the money that no one else is using doesn't fly, it's not that easy.  You need to have excess capital in order to do this.  What is bitcoinica's excess capital?<p>4) They do NOTHING to ensure counter-party risk!!  What if Bitcoinica implodes and goes under?  Again, what is their excess capital to ensure that customers don't share in any losses?  If they suffer a catastrophic loss from bad trades, is that loss divided amongst all the customers?<p>I'm not saying they are crooks.  I'm very interested in their platform, because I do a lot of algorithmic trading, so I'm familiar with this.  I just want answers to these very basic questions before I deposit any money into this thing.",1315667397

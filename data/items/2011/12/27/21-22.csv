3397602,comment,3395061,3397270,3,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Guyenet is pushing the same idea that most of mainstream nutrition science pushes: playing with the composition of a diet may affect your willingness to stick with a diet.<p>This is pretty well known, and has a fairly simple mechanism. By imposing artificial restrictions on your diet (no carbs, no acidic foods, nothing brown to yellow in color), you reduce the amount of calories you can consume. I.e., where you previously saw ""ooh, lemon cake, let me eat"", you now say ""no yellow food"". Caloric consumption goes down, and so does bodyfat.<p>This is why basically all weirdo diets work in the short term.<p>The fact is that Taubes theories about insulin have been shown to be false. His theories that obese people retain more fat has also been shown to be false. His theories that obese people have a lower metabolic rate have also been shown to be false. He continues to push them in spite of this. That's the definition of charlatan.<p>Another experiment: go read this article of his. <a href=""http://garytaubes.com/2010/12/inanity-of-overeating/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://garytaubes.com/2010/12/inanity-of-overeating/</a><p>Then based on his presentation, state what you think his hypothetical fat person and thin person are eating.

3397584,comment,3395344,3395344,2,0,SatvikBeri,,,"I'm going to assume you're at least open to the idea of computer programming. I was in a very similar situation at 20. I had a very hard time finding a job, and when I did it didn't pay very well. I later moved, and repeated the experience. Finally I figured some things out, and 3 years later I'm making 3 times as much and jobs are applying for me.<p>Here is my step-by-step advice:\n1. Look at the job postings in your geographical area and try to find out what languages/technical skills they are looking for. There should be a fairly common job title, such as ""SAS Analyst."" You are going to paint yourself as the ideal candidate for this job title-it should be pretty common amongst different companies, but also specific enough that anyone will know immediately what you're looking for if you say ""I'm looking for a position as an XYZ."" Being overly broad (""I'm looking for a position as a programmer"") is the kiss of death here! \n2. Learn at least one of those languages/skills really well, and try to get some proof. This may be a certification or some sort of app you build. I recommend SAS if it's desirable in your area-it's very easy to get SAS certified and get SAS jobs in my experience.\n3. Follow this approach to applying for jobs:\ni. Network. Talk to people in your local area, especially those who are interested in the skill you learned. Tell them you're looking for a job as a XYZ (your chosen job title). Since you have a specific position in mind people will very easily be able to refer you if someone they know is looking for a person in that field. \nii. Learn how to write a good resume. One very important tip is to add the keywords\nrelated to that job. I found the advice at this site [1] very useful, although beware that some of the other content on the site is a little out there.\niii. Apply to jobs using your improved resume and network. Note that even with a great resume maybe 10% of job postings will reply-don't be discouraged, this just means you have to apply to a lot and network a lot.<p>This advice is not optimized for getting you your ideal dream job-it's optimized for getting a $50k job that will help improve your situation and give you the resources to continue improving your life from there.

And in the mean time you've added three or four different error result formats because even within Facebook nobody knows what an error result should look like.<p>Sure, you moved ""support"" over to stackoverflow, which is at least better organized.  But the problem was not the software.  Today's problem is the same problem you had before: knowledgeable Facebook engineers are not present answering questions.  Combined with the sparse and often wrong documentation, this leaves the community playing ridiculous guessing games.<p>This is a <i>world</i> of difference from the Google APIs I have experienced:  Maps and App Engine.  In both cases, there are forums where the actual engineers who work on the features hang out and respond to user questions.  These people have names and they're not afraid to talk about the design issues involved.  If Google+ inherits this attitude towards developer support, we're going to drop Facebook like an abusive spouse.<p>TL;DR:  Answer questions.  Respond to inquiries, even if the answer is ""I'm not sure yet"".  Treat documentation as a first-class citizen.  And whatever you do, DON'T CLOSE BUGS UNLESS YOU'RE 100% CERTAIN THEY AREN'T BUGS.  Nothing pisses off a developer like spending hours isolating a test case only to be ignored or given the F-U of Won't Fix without an explanation.",1325021319

You might also want planets/asteroids/moons that are 'good' for colonization (easily terra formed or already life sustaining).<p>You probably wouldn't see many fights where you are firing at the resource itself. No one with the money to fire at earth, will actually fire at earth, because it is more valuable as an inhabitable planet. If each side can obliterate whatever is being fought over, you basically have an instant MAD scenario.<p>Similar with moons/asteroids. I'm not going to fire a massive kinetic weapon at a moon or asteroid (and blow it to pieces) if my objective is obtain that object to profit from it. More likely I'll pay people very well to infiltrate and sabotage it, repeatedly. I wouldn't even bother trying to invade.<p>Why not an invasion force?\nWell, you could send an invasion force, but that would be fairly pointless. It is easy to defend an entrenched position that your enemy does not want to shoot at (sabotaging just the defenses might be too obvious, and i think would have too high a possibility of failure). On top of this they can use massive force to repel you, and you cannot (you don't want to obliterate your objective). So an invasion fleet is probably not likely.<p>A far more likely scenario would be to simply drive your competitor out of business. If they keep getting sabotaged, it becomes unprofitable for them to operate (it becomes a 'cursed' outpost, wages go up, you have to make repairs). Then you can easily take their stuff (or buy it on the cheap when they are going out of business).<p>This gets you into interesting things, you would end up with extensive background and history checks, genetic tests to prove that you really are who you say you are, mental/psychological screening, mind-reading, brainwashing, complex hacking of the computers that do background checks, genetic 'doping' to make  a person pass as someone else, brainwashing.<p>Your competitors will also likely try to assassinate you if they every figure out that you are the one ordering the destruction of their outposts (it should be easy to figure out, as there will be few entities with resources to profit from this).",1325020548

But spacecraft are going to follow a post-industrial revolution paradigm of being materially expensive as well as skill-intensive.

I am curious about what would happen, should you get singled out for ""enhanced screening"" there by their staff.<p>Prior to 9/11, I went to Japan on vacation.

Me and my sister got pulled from the line and led to a small room, with dozens of people.<p>We were only let go 4 hours later (after 27 hours flying, that wasn't exactly pleasant). And that's only because they were checking our story with out uncle, who was a native Japanese and went looking for us when we didn't show up at the airport.<p>And don't even get started on their multiple-page form, in Spanish. I asked for an English version because I couldn't figure it out (I am Brazilian, so they probably figured it was ok).<p>Also, my posessions got searched and I even got inquired about my religious beliefs - there was a postcard from my grandmother to my aunt which had a christian image. I guess that sort of thing would not happen in the US - at least not to a citizen, anyway.<p>Needless to say, while I loved the country, I hate the screening to this day.<p>In the US, a couple of years ago, something similar happened. I got pulled to the ""yellow room"", because my fingerprint didn't match the Visa (my brother's went on the record insted, probably due to confusion, as our names are similar). In any case, I was let go in a couple of minutes, after the officer inquired who the guy showing on the monitor was, and I pointed to my brother waiting a few meters from us. No idea what would have happened if I wasn't travelling with him tho.<p>He also mentioned I will always have that problem (until the Visa expires, that is).

DNS propagation is directly controlled by the TTL setting on a domain entry.<p>TTL stands for Time To Live, this is the number (in seconds) that the DNS entry tells people to keep it active in the DNS server cache's (presuming the DNS server will not over-ride this for either a higher or lower number, which is entirely their choice but not common.) This is done so that any request to adomain.com will not have to require a DNS lookup to the main serve for every page request.<p>It is true that if you have not done a lookup on the domain, then your computer and DNS servers would presumably not have any active DNS records for the domain. So you can make a change and ""viola"" within 5 minutes (the next time you visit the site) you will have the updated record. However,  if you had recently done a DNS inquiry and eceived the record for the old DNS entry, you will need to wait for the old DNS entry to expire before the DNS server you are using will choose to look it up again. This doesn't go into any of the fun of what happens when you have 2 or more DNS servers setup, but ultimately what people are seeing is that the ""48 hour"" waiting period is substantially less, however most ISPs will stick to this default number to reduce worrisome support from their clients who think otherwise but don't know anything about how DNS works so support will never be able to explain this in laymen terms (or wait, did I just do that?)",1325020024

Bullying is correlated with acts of violence, but violence and bullying are different things.\nI think our in-group out-group behavior and all the brutal tendencies stem from our very evolution.

It seems like an paradox, how do people who are extremely anti-social form a group, wouldn&#x27;t they just be bunch of isolated loners ?

Claims are drafted by, or for, the patentee.<p>The patent description must, in order to comply with the relevant laws, disclose the invention in a way that makes it possible for a skilled worker in the art to repeat the invention. If it does not the application should fail. Patent description must include at least one concrete implementation of the invention but the invention itself can cover many different implementations. The description needs to support the breadth of the claims.<p>Yes, practically - especially in the USA in the past - so-called submarine patents could surface out of the depths.

But I&#x27;m not going to sacrifice my time for them either.  If I need to cut time commitments from my hiring pipeline I will do it at the interview component.  I would gladly trade 4 hours of work sample time for a half day of onsite interviews for instance.<p>As far as eliminating obvious misfits, I&#x27;d argue that a mechanical suite of tests (I like to provide say 70% of them to the candidate) gets much lower false negatives and much higher true positives than any &quot;simpler&quot; test you can devise.<p>The Guerrilla guide is a very good starting point btw, but I think it misses the central problem, which is, interviewing is not a reliable way to filter candidates for software development jobs, no matter how you do it.",1424961158

9112657,comment,9111866,9111866,0,0,pjungwir,,,"These are some very nice tips! One of the things I like so much about ActiveRecord is that it plays nice with pretty much every example here, e.g. `Product.where(&quot;title ~* &#x27;title&#x27;&quot;)` or `Product.where(&quot;title ~* ?&quot;, title)`. A few other remarks:<p>- I&#x27;m so glad to see someone talking about `generate_series` for time-series reports. I often see queries that are `GROUP BY date`, which is <i>usually</i> okay, but will skip an output row if you have no data for a certain day. If you want to force one-row-per-day, use `generate_series`.<p>- His `GROUP BY` query can be rewritten with less repetition like this:<p><pre><code>    SELECT  sku,\n            SUM(price),\n            date_part(&#x27;month&#x27;, created_at) m\n    FROM invoice_items\n    GROUP BY m\n    HAVING m = 9\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` can reference expressions that are aliased in your `SELECT`.<p>- Also on this query: In Postgres if `sku` is a primary key, then you can `SELECT` other columns from `invoice_items` without including them in `GROUP BY`, e.g. `SELECT sku, name, supplier_id, etc`. I <i>think</i> even joined stuff is okay: `SELECT sku, suppliers.name`.<p>- One more nit on this query: I think this is backwards from what he meant?: &quot;having to be sure that whatever you GROUP BY is in your SELECT clause.&quot;<p>- Usually I don&#x27;t use window functions where a `GROUP BY` will do, but to me the biggest value in window functions is they don&#x27;t force any particular structure on the overall query, so they don&#x27;t constrain you the way `GROUP BY` does. He kind of alludes to this when he shows per-sku monthly sales combined with total monthly sales. Good example!<p>- I&#x27;m not sure his CTE example shows much added value from the CTE, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something. The three places I really like CTEs are (1) recursion, (2) with INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE and RETURNING, (3) very big queries. But a lot there depends on taste.<p>- When you use `string_agg` and friends, you can give an ordering for just that function: `string_agg(downloads.title, &#x27;,&#x27; ORDER BY products.sku)`. That syntax works for every aggregate function (I believe), although it&#x27;s especially useful for the *_agg family.<p>Thanks for sharing these tips! I wish more people knew the cool things you can do beyond SELECT x FROM y.",1424961104

After about one week of searching I found only one job for junior Java developer(maybe I am searching wrong). The next idea came to my mind was to get certificate, that way I will have better chance of getting a job right ? The oracle Java SE 8 Programmer I cost about 150 pounds, which I think are too much money for person that is not working. Next idea I have was to work for open source project just to meet people, but I think I don&#x27;t have necessary skills for that.

Either a developer writes good code, or they don&#x27;t.  Further, I take getting my next job very seriously.  I take hiring my next colleague equally seriously.  I&#x27;d hope that this seriousness (in combination with me asking for a reasonable amount of work sample) would encourage everyone involved to put their best foot forward.<p>> How would you feel about, say, providing a candidate with a chunk of [source] code and 30 minutes to read through and grok it.<p>I have never tried this so don&#x27;t have any experiential recommendations.  My instinct is to think that this would be problematic, not because it is wrong to judge someones ability to learn foreign code, rather because the evaluation step would be very hard to filter for someone who learned foreign code quickly, from someone who is great at talking about stuff generally.<p>If I wanted to judge someones foreign code ability, I would as part of the code project, expect them to interact with a provided set of foreign code.  I&#x27;d set explicit boundaries about how much they could or could not change it and then judge the candidate on how their new code interacted with the legacy code as well as what and how they changed the legacy system.<p>> I know reading code is in some ways easier than writing<p>I don&#x27;t think that is in the least bit true.  I think evaluating a candidates ability to interact with legacy code is a hugely valuable thing to filter on in most environments, it&#x27;s just very hard to design a fair and repeatable work sample problem around it.",1424960498

However, almost no one agrees what that body of knowledge should be per position (and it&#x27;s never going to be the same across positions or companies). Part of that is because you need to be able to practically communicate to someone about the things he&#x27;s going to be responsible for. The other parts are actually doing the job and reducing the ramp up time.<p>The more accommodating positions will need less up-front knowledge (e.g. hiring any junior developer). They&#x27;re okay if you don&#x27;t know a few basics but you need to demonstrate <i>something</i>. You can&#x27;t be too accommodating or what is the difference between him and someone from another field with no knowledge?<p>You also can&#x27;t require too much knowledge up-front, or you just end up hunting for purple squirrels. Everyone (that is sane) already accepts that there is some ramp up time.<p>&#x27;Hitting the ground running&#x27;, which is what people with a lot of up-front knowledge should be able to do, should be a luxury, not a requirement. Asking it of someone who isn&#x27;t prepared is asking for a technical debt loan from the mafia loan sharks. The reason hiring managers seek people who can do this is because it means more work done in the same amount of time.<p>The conventional way to break into the industry is a CS degree and an internship, but that&#x27;s not set in stone (contrast: medical doctors/scientists/etc).

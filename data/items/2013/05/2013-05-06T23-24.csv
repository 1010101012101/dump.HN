It's not like Ubuntu (or any project) has hordes of developers who're just too lazy to tackle your bug: maybe not many people have that model, or don't tend to switch between speakers and headphones much. Maybe people couldn't reproduce the bug, or maybe just no-one could see how to fix it.<p>There's a whole host of reasons why bugs don't get fixed, but it's rarely because the project as a whole 'just decided to shelve it'.",1367884752

5665560,comment,5664839,5664839,3,0,jarrett,,,"After reading your list of professional habits--writing tests, contributing to open source, reading lots of technical literature--I think you're head and shoulders above a lot of employed programmers. I've been the technical interviewer before, and if you told me all that, I'd recommend hiring you, assuming you have a reasonable background. It sounds like you have a real appreciation for craftsmanship, which far too many programmers lack.<p>I don't know what your code's like, but I'm going to take a guess that it's above average. In my experience, people who think about the stuff you mentioned tend to write above-average code.<p>Let me tell you what I always looked for in technical interviews. I wasn't trying to determine whether a candidate was an utter genius who would offer novel and clever solutions to hard problems. That's too high a bar; most companies can't expect to consistently attract those types of candidates.<p>Instead, I wanted to see if candidates would write <i>maintainable</i> code. In other words, my #1 concern was whether the candidate was going to create a big mess for the rest of us to clean up. Will they pollute my functions with a bunch of special-case if statements because they had to add a new feature that doesn't fit into the current architecture? Or will they recognize the situation for what it is and start a conversation about changing the architecture? Will they take a class named Car and use it to represent a House, just because it exposes the method .door? Or will they recognize the importance of logical naming, create a new House class, and break out the .door method into a mixin? Stuff like that.<p>Not every interviewer makes that the #1 concern. We all have our pet peeves. But my point is, there's usually some very mundane, practical thing they're looking for. Not super-ninja-rockstar coder status. If you can determine what that practical concern is, you can then try to convince the interviewer why you're exactly what they need.",1367884402

They read a lot of papers, they know a lot about the inner workings of many common and obscure programming languages. Many know and love development process theory and they contribute to open source projects. Here is the but: when push comes to shove, they can't deliver to production.<p>I've seen many smart coders falling short in real-life scenarios, where they refuse to take the shortcuts and make the trade-offs that most high-paced production projects need to deliver on time. And on the other side of the fence I have seen mediocre programmers deliver quality apps on schedule by allowing themselves to take what to a purist would look like shortcuts. More often than not, companies prefer the latter one.<p>Perhaps many employers have a process of surfacing stuff like that during the interview phase? Every time I interview someone to fill a position working with developing and delivering applications written in X, and all they want to do is tell me about the awesome type system in Y, alarms start to sound in my head.",1367884340

Most of the time, the student is taking the blame that belongs to the education industry.<p>Last week, my son had a ""Chapter 9"" math test here in a top-ranked Silicon Valley public school. His teacher pointed us to an official study guide PDF, which we went over carefully. I was not at all surprised to find that it covered a random grab bag of unrelated topics: sorting a half-dozen fractions, each with different denominators, two different silly algorithms for multidigit multiplication, how many $2.30 widgets can you buy for $9.00, and a few others.<p>This incoherent, random presentation of unrelated topics within a single chapter is totally characteristic of the ""reform math"" so beloved by our ""progressive educators."" They despise the approach of methodically working through a small number of carefully sequenced topics, making sure that the foundation of layer N is solid before getting to work building the closely related layer N+1 on top of it. They call it, ""drill and kill,"" ""soul-crushing,"" and ""creativity destroying.""<p>Instead of mastering a few closely-related concepts each year and systematically building expertise, they prefer ""exposing"" kids briefly to lots of unrelated math ideas, trusting that some kids will get some of it, and telling the rest to ""trust the spiral,"" meaning trust that when they hop, skip, and jump over multiple topics the following year and the year after that, most of them will eventually ""get"" most of the stuff.<p>The result is that many parents just teach their kids real math outside of school. Many in our neighborhood send them to Chinese school, which teaches them math in addition to Chinese. The Chinese school buses line up in front of all of our local elementary schools at the end of each school day. (A lot of blond kids board those buses.) Some send them to Kumon, which is getting to be as common a sight around here as McDonalds or Starbucks.<p>I teach mine myself, using non-US curricula (Chinese, Japanese, and Singaporean in my case.) I feel terrible for the kids who don't have parents doing the schools' job for them, whose math skills are limited to what they can pick up from their classmates in ""group discovery"" sessions, since the ""professional educators"" have now decided that kids learn best what they discover for themselves and now serve merely as ""guides on the side"" in edu-speak.<p>My son took his Chapter 9 test and reported to me that, with the exception of testing the two different, useless multiplication algorithms, the test was a DIFFERENT grab bag of unrelated math topics, bearing little resemblance to the study guide. Totally typical of ""reform math."" He did fine, but only because he had learned all of it outside school. His friends who rely on what they learn at school think he's a genius.<p>So kids go through this ridiculous joke of a math education and can't do math. The school points at their friends who did just fine (because--shh!--they learned math elsewhere), the school takes credit for having taught them so well and tells the others and their parents, ""well, not all kids are equally good at math, but many of your classmates learned quite well,"" clearly implying that the kids who didn't are somehow defective.<p>The result is that those kids will soon be saying, ""I'm just no good at math.""

Firefox/Flash/Phonon/Skype all route through PulseAudio, which gets sent to JACK. all ALSA-only applications get routed through Loopback, which gets sent to JACK. And you can route all of this sound (visually, if you use the Claudia app) to whatever processing or recording application you want.<p>Two weeks ago, I spent 20 minutes with 3 KXStudio Laptops and a master KXStudio workstation, and got all the laptops acting as input slaves to pipe live instruments and mics to Ardour running on the workstation using Opus as the transferring codec. all it took was loading the network module into JACK, and making sure there was gigE/cat6 for networking. we had mp3's and FLAC's of the concert ready for the band to review before their roadies were done packing up the gear.<p>As for high-end hardware, the laptops are using M-Audio Fast Track Pros and 10/10's. None of the hardware goes for more than $150, and we're using ultra-cheap AMD Fusion laptop slaves sourced from alibaba with an AMD A10-based workstation as master. We're at $2800, including 3 monitors.<p>Because an AMD A10 with 12GB of RAM is stupid overpowered for audio production, we installed MacOS X via KVM and routed that output through JACK as well. WINE loads quite a few professional digital audio workstation packages, and a ton of VSTs, and wineasio makes them all work with JACK.

Then you can talk about those, how you designed them and why, and that can fix a poor technical interview. Those also help convey your passion.<p>10 rejections is insignificant, I think nobody has faced fewer rejections than that for anything, whether it's finding a job or finding funding for a startup or even finding a date.<p>I would need more information to know what's going wrong, but 10 rejections isn't even an indication that anything is wrong. If the technical interviews are not going well then it ""could"" mean:
- you're not applying for the right position
- you're looking for something you don't have experience in
- you don't show passion or a good attitude
- you seem desperate and mostly care for the money
- you show a lack of interest in the company and their products<p>Maybe you are missing out on a lot of opportunities:
- You can do freelancing
- You can find a non-tech company to work for, you'd be surprised by how many need developers: hospitals, government, transportation companies, airlines, insurances, banks... Have you sent your resume to Bank of America?
- You can find a startup that's in a field you kinda know and offer your help
- You can talk to a staffing company, they make money by finding you a job
- Go to events (eg. PHP event, Ruby on Rails, startups events, conferences...) and do networking. It's the easiest way to find a job, though you need to be good at talking to people.
- Look for jobs on angel.co, monster.com, dice.com",1367883350

I saw enough graduating students and multi-stint postdocs failing to ""make it"" in academia and struggling to transition out that I realized it wasn't a road I could afford to go down.  Better to start a new career at 26 by choice than at 36 out of desperation.<p>Also, the money issue does matter.  You might think it's worth radically diminished wages it to live the ""life of the mind"" (I certainly did at one time), but be aware that it may have significant long-term impact on your earnings.  After a couple years of seeing the lifestyle and economic milestones of friends who started careers after college I felt like I was being left behind socially and economically in enough ways that I might never be able to catch up.  The contrast between successful college friends with my older academic friends ""aging out"" of the academic system into financial chaos and despair couldn't have been more clear.<p>The whole experience has made me somewhat anti-credentialist in my outlook.  Since leaving with a masters and changing fields I've met a lot of genuinely smart people that I never would have run into while living in an academic silo.  Now I tell everyone to learn whatever they want, whenever they want, and don't be intimidated by anyone's PhD in bullshitology.  Because being an expert in some tiny ultraniche does not make them smarter or better than you.<p>> When i go into the office and talk shop with students/other professors/my advisor i get to talk details (math, different approaches, similar work, etc) as opposed to having to setup the problem over and over again, simplifying the idea and methods... Ideas move fast, and with a good advisor and research group it's easy to stop caring about who is on what publication and be excited about contributing to a solution<p>It sounds like either your dept is a lot less cutthroat than mine was, or you're early enough in the program that the novelty hasn't worn off yet.

These streamers also make money from donations, so keep that in mind. I've heard that some donations were as high as 10k, which is insane. Not all streamers get that much. I've also heard that one popular streamer showed his Paypal account on stream and had upwards of 90k. Speculation, I know, but I don't think it's far fetched. You can also go on certain streams and read off the donations that they post, add it up, and extrapolate to a month's salary. Just from donations!<p>The LoL streamers earn A LOT of money from streaming. A team may get 30K viewers PER MEMBER. TSM did this for a while. Their members would barely focus on team practice, they'd stream most of the day to upwards of 20k+ viewers. TSM also does an online invitational tournament which also gets a ton of viewers.<p>Simply put, the market is growing and a lot of that growth is coming from Twitch. They have a ton of power now and it's scary. Sure, if Twitch went away, e-Sports would still be around because that part of the industry is built around tournament and sponsorship money. What would happen, though, is a lot of people would lose their jobs and e-Sports would be destabilized for quite a while. Not that Twitch will go away suddenly, but they have way too much power and I would not be surprised if they started abusing it even more.<p>Twitch has an agenda now. Talk to any Admin and you'll know this. Their agenda is to appear professional. Thus, anything deemed unprofessional is going to get you in trouble. This means, essentially, that any non-gaming content is barred completely. Streamers will usually take breaks from their games (they play for 6+ hours in one sitting) by watching stuff on stream or just talking and relaxing with the viewers.

I'm a mechanical engineer and have gotten pretty good with ""math tricks"" (e.g. 103x7 is difficult, but I can compute 100x7+3*7 much easier and know to rewrite the problem to be done in my head).<p>A trick like that should be pretty simple to figure out, but grade school math is taught in such a rigid fashion that students (who later become full grown adults) don't think to try it.  Think about the last time you went to dinner with friends.  How many calculators did it take to figure out the bill?  Here in New Jersey, tax is 7% and 18% gratuity is pretty standard.  Add up your meal and add 25% which you should be able to do in your head since you just need to divide by 4.  Yet, last time I went out to dinner, the lawyer, accountant, and two physical therapists (i.e. 3 years of grad school) all pulled out their iPhones and then looked at me with confusion when I tried to explain the 25% solution.  I'm not sure they need to be able to do the math in their heads (part of my job involves doing quick math in my head, so I have more practice), but the logic behind it shouldn't confuse them.<p>I often hear people talk about the need for high school classes that teach people how to balance a checkbook and other questionably useful skills.  If you have to teach someone to balance a checkbook, you've already failed them.    You've missed the part of education that should teach and develop the logic to make the checkbook lesson take 1 minute.",1367881414

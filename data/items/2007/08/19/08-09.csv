When he says sound, he means that a field is worthwhile, both because it has problems that are interesting in a purely technical way and because solutions to them are in some way actually useful to non-CS humanity.  When you say sound, you mean pedantically verifiable for the benefit of other theorists. Graphics is sound because not only does it have interesting math, it aids or entertains laymen; PL research isn't, because nobody except PL researchers cares. ",1187510996

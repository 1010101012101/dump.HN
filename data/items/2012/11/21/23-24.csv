This means<p>a) It's possible that not all of the statements he ever made about the Hyperloop will be true for the final design (if any). I'd be especially cautious about the comment about right of way issues. This might as well just mean that he found an unused railroad track or something. And<p>b) Nobody knows if it can be done. Keep that in mind when debating the ideas. As far as I'm concerned, all ideas are constructive at this point.<p>I'm not a physicist and it's very likely that this solution is completely impossible, but let me ask anyway. If you just had a 1200 mile long train and you somehow got the mass going in a circle at 1200 mp/h, how much energy would you need to keep that momentum going? Could you cover that with solar panels covering the 1200 miles of track?",1353542143

They ended up with radios there users are unable to use.  Why they are unable to use them again is not detailed and I can imagine many on here who would love that challenge to work out how to use a new peace of technology.<p>There is also the prospect that they got training and it was either not very good or clearly not targeted at the level of customer understanding.<p>With all that if these chaps landed planes then it would get rather dangerous too fly.

External companies know that statistically these teams don't finish so many races, and the attention to detail in the design and finish for these teams is much less than those premium teams receive.\n==<p>Not true. I have worked for several lower rug F1 teams (purely by chance - I live in Oxfordshire and I am not interested in relocating to Marnello). Suppliers love lower order teams - and its because they punch above their weight. Take for example the Saubers - low budget (~USD80 million?), high skill engineers. Also, suppliers provide standard components - they do not affect the race outcome - they are standardized - take for example CF brakes. An F1 race outcome depends on car balance w.r.t aero maps. Nothing more.<p>>>It is sadly a vicious circle. Statistically, they will have worse drivers, who are more likely to crash or damage the cars early in the race, so often the cars in the lower order teams don't have the required staying power for the entire race.\n==<p>Not true.

[4:9] means indeces [4][5][6][7][8][9], in other words, ""martin"".<p>The camry example was just an illustration of the power relationship of something moving through water. Nothing more than that.<p>The comparison of a container ship with 5,000 TEU (2,500 40 foot containers) vs. a train is, of course, different.  And, of course, it isn't as simple as looking at cross-sectional area.  That would be a gross oversimplification.  Sometimes you have to assume that a cow is a uniform sphere of milk just to start to have some numbers to talk about.<p>Imagine a train design to carry containers at 200 miles per hour.  Single file.  So, now, the cross sectional area is that of a single container, which is very small.  If the train is designed to minimize parasitic drag and all of the frictional components of the rolling system it could be incredibly efficient when compared to a ship pushing some 4000 square feet (400 square meters) of cross sectional area of water at 20 miles per hour.<p>And, as I have said multiple times, this isn't really solely about pure energy efficiency as much as a forward looking idea to that hopes to deal with the grotesque level of environmental pollution these ships produce as well as what might happen over the next 100 or 200 years with fossil fuels.  One really has to start looking in at least a 50 to 100 year time scale to understand that what we are doing today is not sustainable in any way at all.

4816867,comment,4814249,4814249,0,0,grellas,,,"Mr. Stallman's proposed solution is both simple and elegant: take all software that runs on a general purpose machine and legislate a ""safe harbor"" from patent claims for software falling in that category. This essentially would return the state of the law to what it was through the early 1990s, recognizing that software patents are fine when tied to specialized hardware or when they pertain to a special-purpose machine but not otherwise. Such a proposal is ""radical"" in dealing with the problem once and for all but is also remarkably conservative in only singling out for elimination the one category of patents most vulnerable to the potent objection that its retention does little or nothing to further the progress of science and hence doesn't warrant the monopoly protections afforded by the patent laws. The logic here <i>should</i> enable Congress to support it <i>if</i> it chose to reexamine the issues purely from a social and legal perspective.<p>Still, the <i>practical</i> issues remain daunting. What becomes of existing software patents, for example? Purists may say these are not ""property"" but massive dollars have been paid for the rights to own them and there will be <i>huge</i> resistance, not to mention constitutional objections, over any idea that these suddenly should be rendered worthless by legislative action. If these stay intact for the next 20+ years, what good does a safe harbor do in applying only prospectively? More important, those with a stake in the game - even relatively benign players such as Google - want to hedge and trim on the issues in order to protect their investments, and this means that inordinate pressure will be put on Congress <i>not</i> to single out software patents for elimination, emphasizing instead more limited measures to help fight trolls and so on.<p>With so much resistance, and with an apathetic public, how to build sufficient momentum to push Congress toward a true solution? Developers might lead this charge but I wonder. Founders are mostly not directly affected by software patents and neither are employees at bigger companies who are conscripted to keep churning them out. And those most directly hit in the patent wars resist reform to protect their own investments.<p>So Mr. Stallman finds himself alone in his position at this conference: not because his solution is bad but because of inordinately difficult practical barriers. At least we see in this conference that persons of influence in this area are finally willing to begin seeking incremental reform. If the worst of the abuses can be fixed (e.g., the troll issue), that at least is a start. And, who knows, maybe radical changes can occur after initial progress is made. Time will tell.",1353540822

If you're a founder or CEO, you will have to, but make sure you build a company where every engineer does not have to.

The people pushing the RMS-approved term hardest have no concept of presentation, and it turns people off of listening. I would be instantly associated with the worst pushers of the term if I started using it, so it's a nonstarter.<p>Edit: GNU would get more attention if the FSF partnered with major Linux distribution vendors to give GNU a prominent placement in installers, documentation, and marketing. RMS peeing a line at the unmarketable ""GNU/Linux"" is only going to alienate people.",1353539698

4816806,comment,4813416,4816654,3,0,robomartin,,,"No, the calculations are exactly right given the conditions I presented.<p>The nice little boat you are linking to can do what it does largely because at a certain speed it will start to plane.  These are very, very different conditions.<p>Two of the components of drag on a boat are form and parasitic or frictional drag.  The first can be thought of as simply the drag created to push water out of the way.  Here the shape of the boat is important.  The second is the drag created by water ""rubbing"" against the portion of the hull in contact with it.  Think of sandpaper against wood. More wood and more sandpaper means more resistance to motion.<p>As speed increases both friction and form drag increase with the square of the speed.<p>On a planing hull --one that can generate lift and get the boat up and partially out of the water-- form drag decreases significantly once you are ""on a plane"" (off the water) and friction drag increases. As it turns out, each boat has a sweet spot where it operates best.  And, of course, as you get on a plane the power required in order to reach or sustain a given speed decreases significantly when compared to a displacement (non-planing) hull.<p>A Panamax ship carrying 4,400 TEU does not plane.  It is, as far as a know, a pure displacement vessel.  So, yeah, you need a tremendous amount of power to counteract significant components of both form and parasitic drag.<p>A Panamax container ship can have up to nearly 400 square meters of cross-sectional area under water.  That's about 4,000 square feet.  So, while it isn't exactly the same thing, only for the purpose of visualization, imagine a 100 foot long x 40 foot rigid piece of plywood fully submerged in water.  Not try to push it forward at 20 miles per hour.  Right.  That's why they have to burn nearly a million and a half dollars of bunker-C fuel to get from Los Angeles to NYC.<p>Physics can be really inconvenient sometimes.",1353539597

When a new theme is released, if it's good/attractive enough, it'll get many many sales. Then, you should provide ongoing support to your items. When you have 1-2 themes that's good, but having 6 or 7 themes, all of them with ongoing support turns out quite hard to maintain.<p>Eventually, the themes stop selling, unless you've created some sort of product that sells like hotcakes all the time (there are a few). But, most of the themes sell for a few weeks/months then you have to start working on a brand new product again, to keep up with the competition, and to promote your previously released products.<p>I had issues scaling the business since I was not able to cope with the amount of work that needed to be done (and also because I couldn't find anybody competent enough to provide support / fixes).

Not to mention having 0% time to work on side projects.<p>It's not a fire and forget scheme, each product has its own ongoing support service that has to be provided. There are people that purchase the theme just because of your support, not mainly because it looks good enough. For a single person (doing everything) becomes quite a lot to handle, even if the profits are quite lucrative.<p>If all you ever want to do in your life is sell themes, then the marketplace is great for you.

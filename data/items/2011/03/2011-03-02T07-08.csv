2278804,comment,2277831,2277831,0,0,Stormbringer,,,"From the article:<p><i>""Being effective in a company also means working hard, being reliable, and being an excellent member of the team.""</i><p>Translation: keep your head down, don't rock the boat and don't have any passion for what you do.  This is the recipe for 'success' (i.e. continued employment) at big companies.<p><i>""As a result, a company needs lots of smart, super engaged employees who can identify its particular weaknesses and help it improve them.  However, sometimes really smart employees develop agendas other than improving the company.""</i><p>No.  These so called 'agendas' don't just mysteriously appear.  What happens is that the big company goes to great lengths to hire smart people, and then even greater lengths to ignore them.  At this point, the smart employee has two options (1) stay or (2) leave.<p>From sarahmccrum's comment in this thread: <i>""I saw that most of the clever people who were around left, often when they were most needed""</i><p>That's the second scenario, the smart person says ""screw it"" and leaves. Sometimes that is the most mature decision.  If some behaviour that is bad for the company is deeply engrained, is it really worth the futile tilting at windmills quest to get it changed?  Perhaps they have gone on such crusades before only to get burnt (at the stake).<p>In the first scenario, where they stay, what are they going to do?  They can (a) decide to ignore the thing that is bad for the company, (b) decide to keep banging their head against the wall in the same way, (c) escalate - by trying to change the way that they communicate the seriousness of the problem or the audience (brass didn't listen, maybe the grass(roots) will?).<p>(a) shows low levels of motivation or commitment to the company (but hey, apparently that is a good thing so long as you hide it (sarcasm)), additionally, it can be genuinely difficult for smart people to ignore situations that are sub-optimal.  If you're a programmer and your job basically boils down to 'fix things' ... it is very hard to draw the line and not try to fix a broken process.  It is that itch that needs to be scratched.<p>(b) is just going to continue to get them ignored, or perhaps labelled as 'not a team player'.  Way to go corporate culture.  Eventually they'll get fired or tired and switch to a different strategy.<p>(c) is the 'problem'.  Smart people aren't always good sales people.  And it is fundamentally a sales problem, where they need to identify the right people to make the change, and then sell them on the idea (by convincing them they will save money, and that it was their idea in the first place).  Now the geeks with low social skills is a common cliché, lets ignore that tired and played out meme...<p>...consider if you will the problem of identifying exactly who the people are to get on board with the change.  Power flows in strange ways in big companies, it isn't always just a linear thing directly from the top to the bottom.  In my experience it is almost <i>never</i> linear.<p>Identifying the true power structure in a corporation (for a particular change that is required) is <i>enormously difficult</i>.  Moreover, the underlying power structure can change depending on what the problem is, or over time, or any of many different variables can effect what the true power structure is on day X for problem Y.  Becoming a better communicator is practically <i>trivial</i> compared to the problem of identifying the correct power structure to address the problem.<p>So you might think the moral of the story is that geeks need to become better communicators.  But NO!  Certainly not!  Becoming a better communicator is the path to either management or architecture, neither of which is a fate that I would wish on anybody.<p>For the smart person stuck in a stupid situation, the smart thing is just to move on.  It doesn't matter that you are not loyal to the company, you gave it a good shot.  Try to leave on good terms (itself a marketing problem (blah blah professional development etc)).  Loyalty doesn't matter, because the company has <i>zero</i> loyalty to you.  And true loyalty <i>must</i> be bi-directional.",1299051996

MtGO players are largely also paper card players - in particular, the intensely competitive ones who are willing to pay $4 per virtual booster for an online venue to test out competition decks - so matching the paper rules was essential. At the same time, the way they avoided problems with the paper distributors was to cater to the hard-core players and ignore the casual market.<p>TL;DR: Wizards is too dependent on paper card sales to design a next-gen online TCG.",1299050450

We do have choices or at least the ability to influence the market by our own choices. I don't see any problem with these folks raising some valid issues, even if they do it in less than tactful fashion, but ultimately they are fighting a losing battle. Android, in its most accessible form, is not going to be the open platform some people envisioned. Google is not going to magically become as adept as Apple at selling things. Google isn't doing these things because they want to piss off developers and neither is Apple. They're doing it because they either just don't get it or they are putting their own best interests first. I think most of us relate to this because it's the same basic choice individuals make managing their own personal/financial affairs.

Apple (I imagine) spends a ridiculous amount of time on user interface, paying experts to go over their UI and making sure it sparkles. Whereas the programmers who donate their time to open source are a lot more involved in their projects, and don't spend as much time on the ""useless"" end sparkle.<p>To be fair, this is a very broad statement, and thanks to projects like Ubuntu focusing more on user interaction it's starting to make headway, but even just looking at what a mark of pride it is to be using something non-intuitively difficult (vim, emacs, cli interfaces, hand-rolling operating systems and packages...), the realm of UI design on open source projects is vastly underpopulated.<p>As to Windows, that's anyone's guess. It may be they're just relaxed enough in their market superiority that they don't feel the need to bring as many designers to the table. Or it may be the other way around: Apple knows that one of the only things that sets it apart from other companies (and Microsoft in particular) is snazzy design, and they've chosen that niche to run with as far as they can.",1299049519

The best solution, to my mind, is to allow the receiver ('wants-to-know person') to verify.  How do you prevent people from 'griefing' by repeatedly saying a major event has just occurred, thus SMS spamming a bunch of people who want to know, say, when Spore is released?  You could wait for multiple people to say something just happened, but then you create a sort of latency, especially for less-heavily-watched items, and you totally blow the chance to get inside scoops.<p>-Define 'timely manner'.  And do you get points even if you're not the first to say that an event has occurred?<p>Your idea would be viable in terms of income, though, I would think.  Charge software companies to become members, and then create a few never-expiring general-purpose event types for 'exploit found', 'POC posted', 'Code Stolen', etc., while giving them, say, a 3-day advance before anybody else watching those things or similar ones gets notified.",1187891897

It's the first time I've read all these things in one place and it is so very true in my experiences.<p>At my old company, one comment you'd always hear from team members with a new idea was ""Hey, I thought of this in the shower this morning, and I think we should ...""<p>",1187891863

45731,comment,45616,45616,0,0,bmaier,,,"I think the more interesting question would be: What techniques do you use to develop a completely unique solution to a problem?  <p>Most of what is being done today is incremental problem solving.  What are some techniques that can be used to de-construct a problem so that you can get past previous experience bias and find new ways to solve it?<p>I guess what I'm asking is, what techniques do you guys use to get a view from ""10,000 feet"" above a problem rather than the biased view you get when immersed in the middle of it?",1187891598

45727,comment,45698,45718,0,0,vegashacker,,,"I totally agree, and oftentimes, I don't even need a whole night.  Just now, in fact, I left my laptop frustrated, thinking, ""Shoot, what the heck is going on with this bug?!"".  I went to the bathroom and ""forgot"" about my problem during my pee.  Then, one minute later, walking back toward my laptop, I paged the problem back in, and realized my sub-conscious (I guess) had already solved the problem -- I knew exactly what was going on with the bug.<p>It startles me how often and well this works.  It seems like cheating, too, because it feels like I'm not doing the work! :)",1187890743

45719,comment,45698,45698,0,0,mhartl,,,"> Oddly enough, scheduled distractions may be worse than unscheduled ones. If you know you have a meeting in an hour, you don't even start working on something hard.<p>God, how I wish more people understood this.  It might seem like programmers overreact to even the most minor demands on their time---""What's the big deal?  It's only a half-hour meeting!""---but a half-hour meeting can easily kill several hours of productivity.",1187890030
45718,comment,45698,45698,0,0,adamdoupe,,,"> Sometimes when you return to a problem after a rest, you find your unconscious mind has left an answer waiting for you.<p>This happens to me on so may occasions in may different areas.  While programming, if I have a problem I'll sleep on it, wake up, and see the problem in a whole new light.<p>Also, before writing an essay for class, I will read the prompt throughly. This way my brain starts form sentences without conscious thought. ",1187889957

Interestingly, the one I am more passionate about oscillates -- and is nearly always the project I have most recently worked on for a large chunk of time.

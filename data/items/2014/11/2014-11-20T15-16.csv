8636322,comment,8635466,8635466,0,0,joeyh,,,"You know, programs could version their UI&#x27;s.<p>I was struck in Bram Cohen&#x27;s interview by how much care he&#x27;s taken to avoid changing vim&#x27;s behavior at all, while still letting nice new features be added. In the case of vim, you have to learn about features and enable them to change the UI. That works, but it does mean that the default vim experience for a new user lacks a lot of its cool features, and it can be hard to learn about features. (I only learned that vim has persistent undo from that interview.)<p>Imagine if say, firefox, had a UI version number. New users get the current version, and firefox writes that to its config. So upgrades don&#x27;t have to change the UI the user has gotten used to. It could prompt on upgrade to let the user try out the fresh new version, and if they don&#x27;t like it, they could revert back. Even if this were only limited to the &quot;chrome&quot; around the web page (no need to version UI for preferences pages etc), I think it would be a nice win.<p>Gnome 3 sort of did this with its legacy mode, but it&#x27;s a poor imitation at best of gnome 2.<p>I&#x27;m sure that UI developers would hate this. Having to maintain old UI code, or implement pixel-perfect imitations of it using the new UI code. Needing to worry about how to shoehorn new features into an old UI that was not designed for them. Etc.<p>It&#x27;s much easier to put the cognitive load on the shoulders of the user, who is forced to unlearn old habits, develop new muscle memories, and generally grit their teeth and bear it until the new UI fades into the background and stops distracting.. Just in time for a UI refresh to come around!",1416499172

As others have stated, if they can sustain 9% MOM (not trivial beyond the very short term) and keep that $90k cost constant, they will be profitable shortly after going off runway. Even with a 1-2% MOM cost growth they still reach net profitability by the end of the year.<p>I think the blog post is particularly focused on Series A Silicon Valley VC firms. With as easy as it is to get Seed funding at the moment (in SV and with decent connections, anyway), they’ve got multiple companies with – to quote another poster here – 15-25% MOM growth at similar levels of revenue. They’re not looking for the thing that will be making $25k/mo in profit a year from now. They’re looking for the thing that will be sold for millions of dollars.<p>I think this company would be a great investment for somebody who wants to put $100k+ into a long-term, strategic venture.

8636295,comment,8635543,8635561,0,0,Chevalier,,,"As a 1v1 fighting game with a comparable roster of character genres, Street Fighter seems like a better analogue to Smash Brothers than League of Legends is. And like you said, Street Fighter II remains unpatched... versus the regular patching of the Street Fighter IV series. The comparison seems perfect.<p>Street Fighter IV started the series with a ridiculously overpowered Sagat, who was then arguably overnerfed in Super Street Fighter IV. New characters introduced in Super Street Fighter IV AE, Yun and Yang, were overpowered to the point of breaking the game.<p>I&#x27;m pretty glad that Capcom has, however reluctantly and at whatever expense, continued to balance the characters with each release. The series would have been pretty damn bland if anyone could win by spamming Sagat&#x27;s fireballs since 2008. It&#x27;s given me the opportunity to experiment with relatively underpowered characters, which is WAY more fun -- and since they&#x27;re not (completely) helpless against more powerful characters, I&#x27;ve been able to come up with game-winning tactics that baffle friends who rely on the usual shotos like Ryu/Ken/etc/etc.<p>I&#x27;ve never gotten into Smash Brothers, but I&#x27;d love to hear about the Ice Climbers. I&#x27;ve tried playing them at parties and got absolutely destroyed. Why are they such a powerful character?<p>- - - - -<p>Edit - To answer my own question about the Ice Climbers:<p>&quot;The Ice Climbers aren&#x27;t very good at using their standard arsenal of attacks for continuous hits, normally speaking. With weak throws, small hammers, and slow movement in general (slow falling, air, and dash speed), the Ice Climbers can usually only manage one or two good hits in close before they need to resort to Ice Shots or Blizzard again. With both Climbers present, KOing generally isn&#x27;t too much of a problem, although their Smashes are generally better at racking up the damage than at KOing. With all this in mind, they wouldn&#x27;t seem like the best character choice, if it weren&#x27;t for the following...<p>Chaingrabbing and Desynching<p>Many would consider the Ice Climbers to be &quot;the King and Queen of all Chain Grabs&quot; due to the fact that their two-in-one property allows a variety of chain-grab options. For example, the lead Ice Climber can grab onto one opponent and use the forward throw. In the middle of the throw animation, the player can gain control of the CPU Climber, commanding him/her into performing a forward-air spike, or grabbing again with the CPU Climber while once again bringing the original, player-controlled Climber in for a new grab. Such strings create long and extremely damaging chain grabs capable of being performed at nearly any percent, on nearly any stage. A down side is that the ice climbers don&#x27;t have a very good grab range and because of how much they slide it&#x27;s almost impossible to grab an opponent when they hit your shield unless you powershield his or her attack.<p>For further two-in-one hi jinks, it is even possible to &quot;desync&quot; the CPU partner by confusing it with erratic movement (such as dash-dancing), putting the player in control of both Climbers for as long as they are capable of maintaining it. Once the partner is desynced, the player can have it perform any move while the main Climber is in the middle of one, providing for all sorts of possible attack strategies that can be exceedingly difficult for opponents to escape from (alternating Blizzard, alternating Ice Shot). While desynced, the partner Climber has restrained movement within an invisible box around the main Climber; should he/she be separated or removed from this box, the CPU will take over again. This invisible box makes it so that if you desync yourself from the AI so that it charges a smash attack and you start walking or running away, the AI will slide in your direction while charging the smash. A unique thing that you can do when desynced is that if you desync the AI to charge a smash attack, your belay will cancel the AI&#x27;s charging sequence and teleport it into the belaying sequence.<p>It should be obvious that such techniques are almost impossible to perform in combat, regardless of the player&#x27;s skill, due to the constant string of precise commands required for the Climbers to move/attack as intended. This level of obscene difficulty is what has prevented any seemingly-unfair IC techniques (outside of wobbling in Melee) from seeing competitive bans, especially given that very few professional players maintain or even use them at tournaments. This lack of appearance has made their tier ranking, and whether or not it should be higher, questionable for the time being. Nevertheless, these techniques are the backbone of playing a good pair of Ice Climber; without them, they aren&#x27;t particularly great, so it&#x27;s essential for players who plan on using the Ice Climbers to master them as they are not worthy of their tier placement without these.&quot;<p><a href=""http://supersmashbros.wikia.com/wiki/Ice_Climbers_(SSBB)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supersmashbros.wikia.com/wiki/Ice_Climbers_(SSBB)</a>",1416498928

It was the first time I saw how excited and fun they were having because they just felt cool using the system.  The experience had a huge impact on me.",1416498605

But most (all?) added routes that exhibit that behavior are routes that would exhibit that behavior when run as a regex (and hence converted into a DFA) <i>on their own</i>. (I.e. generally if you would shoot yourself in the foot with this method you&#x27;ve already shot yourself in the foot.)<p>Your worst case is O(n<i>d + O(constructing the new route&#x27;s DFA)), where &quot;n&quot; is the number of nodes in the previous DFA and &quot;d&quot; is the number of nodes in the DFA of the new route.<p>Note that constructing r&#x27;s DFA can be done beforehand, and hence the actual time the router will be offline is only O(n</i>d).<p>(Assuming a simple 2 DFA -> 1 NFA -> DFA merge. Your worst case is that every possible pair from the two, and singleton of the two is present in the final DFA, i.e. ({node from old, node from new} -> n<i>d + {node from old} -> n + {node from new} -> d) -> O(n</i>d + n + d) -> O(n*d). Note that this isn&#x27;t the classic O(2^n) behavior, because we know that, due to the old DFA and new route DFA being DFAs, only one node in n and one node in d can be present at a time in the final stateset.<p>A better bet may be to use the classic &quot;lazily-constructed DFA&quot; approach. In other words, keep it as an NFA while only converting (sets of) nodes to DFA nodes when necessary. If you are worried about memory, you can even do this only for &quot;hot&quot; sections of the NFA, or only for those sections of the NFA that have the most performance gain for the number of nodes added.",1416498574

Google Maps is useless as soon as I leave the house.) OsmAnd/Maps.me do offline properly, but their UIs are lacking and both have serious GPS issues on my Nexus 5.<p>HERE just works great. There are many lovely little features.<p>Like, if I click on a subway station nearby, Google Maps (Lollipop) will show me the name of the station and how long it takes to get there, and if I swipe up it will also tell me the lines going from that station and show some share/depart buttons and street photos.<p>If I click on the same station in HERE, it will overlay the routes of the station&#x27;s subway lines on the map so that I can at once actually see where they are going. Incredibly more useful, especially in big cities like Paris or Berlin where there can be a dozen subway lines or more.<p>I wonder if small features like these and the whole offline thing reflect where the developers come from? It seems like the Google Maps team doesn&#x27;t take public transport very seriously, and that they can&#x27;t imagine people ever being without Internet access.",1416498534

When games set out from the start to be competitive, balanced, and cater to the professional&#x27;s feedback it takes away that element of discovery and letting the game grow organically. If something is obviously broken then A game in recent history that did this was StarCraft 2. StarCraft 1 became a huge competitive game well after the last balance patch came for it. This allowed the players and the community to grow through strategy and map making. In StarCraft 2 once something powerful (and fun) was discovered, players went the route of complaining online so the developers would change it. For myself and many others, this took away a lot of the fun and hurt the longevity of the game. Strategies/races/units falling out of favor did not happen naturally, a patch directly caused it. In StarCraft 1 you could not complain and expect a patch to save you, and you had to come up with something to deal with it.",1416497782

That said, if I have a device that can send a message quickly, I don&#x27;t want to pull it out of my pocket and find out I have to re-learn how to do it. I don&#x27;t care if the interface is better - I want a 5-year interface, not a 5-month interface.<p>When you make statements like &quot;helpful for users&quot; you can&#x27;t stop at a simple focus group. You have to think about how added complexity hurts the reliability and speed of the device.<p>It seems standard that phones older than 1 year are getting slower and slower. I&#x27;ve had the same Android phone for about 22 months, and it&#x27;s been getting unusably slow (mostly, Google Apps (Gmail, Maps, Hangouts) take between 10-15 seconds to open on a white screen.) I&#x27;m willing to believe the hardware has degraded over the time I&#x27;ve had the phone. But primarily, I think software has been pushed out that was designed for flagship phones released in the past 8 months without looking at the performance impact.<p>This is not the kind of innovation we need.",1416496599

Since I got a new job recently, and switched from PHP to C# .NET, and therefore have to use VisualStudio, I feel totally dumbed down, as I have barely any idea what is happening most of the time.<p>And I started to blame myself for this. So this piece really speaks to me, and confirms me that it might not be my fault here.",1416495858

The reality is, they just aren&#x27;t optimizing for you, <i>especially</i> if advertising is their main source of revenue.<p>I do think it&#x27;s important for them to make the power users happy enough, because they are the influencers and early-adopters that the others will follow, but they&#x27;re going to have a hard time putting some nerd rage before the piles of cash flowing in.<p>(This post wasn&#x27;t specifically aimed at you, I do agree with much of your argument, but we have to keep in mind that we aren&#x27;t the only user class, we&#x27;re actually a relatively small one.)",1416495819

Settings in Chrome turns off the tab integration.
On the lock screen you can slide up from anywhere on the screen (which then takes me to the slide code screen).
The rest of the stuff - I guess some personal preference comes into it? But I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying 5.0. Made a few tweaks to the default settings and it&#x27;s great. Feels soooo much faster.",1416495665

Trust was built bottom up, and authority came top down.<p>The way it worked was that clients used a &#x27;coldstart&#x27; file which was the (small number) of servers you trusted to provide your namespace lookups. You to their public key and you put it into your coldstart file. Similarly, a server put the key(s) of the servers it trusted above it in the name space in its coldstart file. And at company &#x27;root&#x27; level was a set of servers run by a trusted authority.<p>Locating the authoritative name server for x.y.z from p.q.z (same as DNS root is rightmost) client in x.y.z asks its server for a trusted y.z server, gets it, and asks that server for a trusted z. server, then asks that server for a q.z. server and finally for a p.q.z. server. Once this has happened once you know trusted servers can can jump to the nearest one to start resolving a new path in the namespace.<p>It was slower on initial lookup and then just as fast as DNS on later ones.<p>It had the downside that compromised (or borked) high level servers could send you on a different path to different root if the server above them was incorrect.<p>It is one of the more fun problems in the whole name/directory service space.",1371699015

Although I don&#x27;t agree with the thesis, any systems article is a great article :)<p>> Also, the container types you mention don&#x27;t support independent, fine-grained choices of isolate-or-not for networking, the file system, user IDs, process IDs, and scheduling of system resources.<p>Granted, containers have gotten better over time. My beef isn&#x27;t with containers, just that they&#x27;re often compared to virtualization as if they&#x27;re a substitute or replacement. I really disagree with that.<p>Containers are still one kernel, with a huge attack surface. Forget about other OSes (including other versions of linux -- system calls <i>do</i> change over time, e.g. -- epoll, inotify, etc.). It&#x27;s still a single buffer cache, so policing memory (beyond RSS) and disk I/O is tricky. It&#x27;s one thing for a platform like Heroku, but containers don&#x27;t make sense for a general purpose, multi-tenant infrastructure.<p>> It&#x27;s unclear why you think such optimization would appear in hypervisors but not kernels, especially given how much more insight a kernel has into the workloads it directly runs compared to a hypervisor running a kernel running workloads.<p>Re: The long-term performance of virtualization.<p>It&#x27;s a different abstraction which I believe lends itself better to using all the resources of large physical machines.
We&#x27;re talking future here (so to be sure, we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see), but as a philosophy it makes sense to me. The same way we hit the limit on cranking the frequency of CPUs and eventually starting adding cores, a single operating system won&#x27;t scale linearly forever. (Not that Linux isn&#x27;t doing a laudable job).
The optimizations I mentioned specifically apply to the use of virt hardware (i.e. the VT extensions effectively give you multiple TLBs because they are tagged) because there are different set of semantics associated with how those threads of execution run on the hardware. The restricted physical interface presented to VMs can free the hardware by shifting some low-level problems of scale and co-ordination into software  (effectively achieving performance by forcing a more scalable software architecture).<p>> Even if hypervisors achieve CPU performance parity for running systems, you still haven&#x27;t addressed the memory and storage overhead (in terms of resident footprint) of running full OS images instead of containers.<p>There are techniques to reduce these overheads, but you&#x27;ve got a good point -- there is a price to pay for full virtualization. But fundamentally, I think this is part of the trade-off of better isolation. A common buffer cache in Linux will improve performance of containers, but it becomes very difficult or impossible to enforce exact resource policies.<p>> You&#x27;re portraying virtualization as having benefits versus containerization while ignoring that containerization also has many benefits over virtualization, especially w.r.t. cost efficiency.<p>I acknowledge that containers can be more efficient -- I just don&#x27;t think it justifies giving up the benefits that full virtualization provides. I also think that virtualization is valuable because it enables some additional technologies, but that&#x27;s a different story...<p>Ultimately, I think it boils down to the fact that I just don&#x27;t think containers and VMs are comparable. I don&#x27;t see how containers could displace virtualization for infrastructure use cases beyond a platform for specific applications. The EC2+Heroku model makes perfect sense -- some people will run containers inside VMs on a general purpose infrastructure, some won&#x27;t.",1371698775

After all, its your project now, not the old developers. This will take time, but if you plan to stay with the codebase for a while, it might be the better option.<p>3.

There&#x27;s no good answer to this question, which is why I don&#x27;t see why Manning would want to be known as the instigator of it all.<p>The rest of your points, even if we simply specify them as true, don&#x27;t really explain why Manning&#x27;s own supporters engage in lies and propaganda. So while it&#x27;s nice to see them again after so long, we pretty much do already know about those claims.<p>E.g. the maltreatment; the trial judge agrees with you and Amnesty International, so why was that not put on the website? At least that would have been truthful. I would think it would also further the cause of the site in getting the &quot;aiding the enemy&quot; charge dropped, if that&#x27;s really what they were about.<p>> I know the reason why they put him through that - it is because Manning was expecting life in prison or to be executed for what he did.<p>If what you say is true, then the military would also have mistreated Sgt. Bales, but they didn&#x27;t. Murder is a capital offense too, in the military.<p>On the other hand, Manning&#x27;s own lawyer said that Manning &quot;joked&quot; about killing himself, which is typically a fairly solid plan for landing yourself on Prevention of Suicide Watch status in a military prison. Doesn&#x27;t excuse keeping him in that status after his military psychiatrist deemed him not a suicide risk, which is why the judge reduced his sentence, but nor does it require some massive conspiracy to explain his treatment.<p>So, if <i>I</i> were a supporter of Manning I wouldn&#x27;t even worry a bit about the charge of &quot;aiding the enemy&quot;, which is almost trivially proven by the prosecution given the way the UCMJ is written. All they really have to prove is that there exists at least one classified document that Manning felt would be posted to the Internet by WikiLeaks, and that there exists at least one enemy of the U.S. with direct or indirect access to WikiLeaks.<p>Instead his supporters should focus on getting his eventual sentence reduced (though Manning himself is doing far better to help his cause than his supporters are, IMHO).",1371697996

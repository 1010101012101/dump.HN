4832755,comment,4832098,4832098,8,0,c0riander,,,"More than just expecting to break your habit, I think the crucial piece is <i>planning</i> what you will do once you have.<p>The most dangerous moment in building a new habit is the moment when you realize that the best case scenario (aka sticking with the awesome new habit) is just not going to happen.  For me, unless I have my Plan B ready to go, I tend to just revert to the status quo or worse (since I already failed, why not go all out).  Having the Plan B - a glorified ""if failure to complete Plan A, then do B"" - already articulated lets me immediately move on to the next thing without beating myself up.<p>This was really helpful for me when I was getting going with  a regular early morning jog.  If I didn't get it in before work, plan B was a quick run after work before I drove home.  The latter wasn't the habit I wanted to stick, but it helped me forgive myself the lapses until morning running became a habit.",1353949151
4832754,comment,4830232,4831216,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"For the most part, I agree - I'm using Windows 8 on my personal computer, and at this point I have absolutely no desire to go back to 7.  But I'm a computer guy.  So despite my initial frustration at having to go through yet another round of Redmond Musical Chairs, it didn't really take me very long at all to get back up to speed with the new UI changes.<p>That said, I do think that is a serious issue for businesses.  Half the folks I work with still aren't up to speed on Windows 7, and it has a much more discoverable UI than 8 does.  Not only is 8 an even bigger widget mover than XP was, but having everything hidden offscreen so you need to be able to independently think to hover the mouse against an edge of the screen to find what you're looking for is going to be an absolute discoverability killer for these users.  No, I don't know why it is that so many people have a hard time learning new UI. But they do, and it's a reality that can't be dispelled with dismissive remarks.",1353949149

4832749,comment,4830858,4830858,1,0,vampirechicken,,,"In the olden days (circa 1995) there were precious few Cert providers (Verisign, Thawte, and few others) and they vetted you, because SSL certs are about trust, not about encryption. As a result, Certs were bloody expensive.<p>In order to get the cert for dsac.dla.mil (the computer shop inside the US Defense Logistics Agency) we provided reference to the act of Congres establishing the DLA, and then the command chain that proved that my boss had the rights/responsibility for the SSL cert for the domain.<p>The process could take weeks, but in the end you could trust that the server on the other end was who they claimed to be.<p>Fast forward tot he internet boom, and everybody needed a cert, and there folks realized that generating certs was physically easy, and could be lucrative, so they started selling cheaper and cheaper certs.  but you can't vet an organization for 29.95, so that aspect of SSL Certs was conveniently forgotten as the masses rushed onto the web.<p>Everybody thinks SSL Certs are about the encryption. We know that the Cert only establishes the identity of the other party. The encryption is performed using a key which is shared after the cert is used to establish trust.<p>So now, people are starting to realize that cheap certs don't provide trust, and we're seeing $1500 vetted certs again, and browsers that change colors to signify trust levels.<p>However, to make this personal, I have a Comodo cert that I got for free with domain registration at namecheap, and a bunch of browsers don't want to trust it.<p>So I'm stuck between not having revenues to buy a super-cert, and having people refuse to use my app because their browser is saying my app's cert isn't trustworthy, and they aren't technical enough to override the warning.<p>So will these $50 wildcard certs fare any better?",1353949070

4832735,comment,4830352,4830888,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">Given a system like that I'd be curious what the numbers might really look like. How high a tax would we need? What would the actual tax burden look like for different amounts of cash-back?<p>It seems like the math is fairly straightforward, but dependent on how much money you need to raise. The big question is to what extent you would want something like that to displace other taxes. If you wanted to displace <i>all</i> other federal, state and local taxes then a sensible rate would likely have to be in the nature of 20-30% (depending on the size of the exemption and how much money the government is to spend).<p>>Could we replicate something similar to the progressivity we have now?<p>It seems to me you could achieve an arbitrarily large degree of progressivity by playing with the size of the exemption. In the extreme case you pay everyone something like $50,000/year and then have an extraordinarily high tax rate, but then you get a different kind of distortion where people quit their jobs because they can live off the tax rebate.<p>On the other hand, having a substantial unconditional rebate (not that large, but say $5000-$10,000/year) would eliminate the call for many need-based programs, because those in need would then have that money with which to buy food and shared accommodations, etc. That would significantly reduce government expenditures for those programs and allow such a large rebate to be had without the need for a prohibitively high tax rate. (It would also eliminate several redundant government bureaucracies dedicated to administering now-redundant need-based programs.)<p>> Why are goods taxed but not services? I've never been clear on that.<p>I think it's jurisdiction dependent. But as to why, it's almost certainly only because that's what has been successfully lobbied for by someone. There isn't any sound economic rationale unless you want to encourage the purchase of services over goods for some reason, at the cost of exactly the sort of distortions you're talking about.",1353948935

4832733,comment,4831475,4832430,1,0,king_jester,,,"There's nothing wrong with having children and having that experience be a great one. However, that kind of story is the dominant narrative in US society and people deserve to hear alternative points of view and experience for those where it didn't turn out OK or as a positive experience. Those kinds of stories and experiences don't get a lot of exposure, esp. in regards to media representation and cultural norms.<p>> Why don't those unhappy parents give up their kids for adoption?<p>The article went over this, as there are a wide variety of reasons someone has a child, planned or not. Some people may have children that they were forced to, or may find that the life they imagined having with children never materialized and that they do not want to continue being a parent. Also, cultural norms and representations of parenthood and expectations of how to interact with children heavily influence the perception of being a parent, so when these norms leave out the experience of people who regret or are not happy with being a parent, we are misleading people. Adoption and foster care systems are not a perfect solution, it would be better to provide more information and experiences for people to help them evaluate whether or not a child would be for them.",1353948903

I train as an advanced Crossfit athlete 5 days a week and it's <i>very intense</i> exercise!<p>Diet is more important than most people think! If you are truly training hard and you don't have a hard time getting your last few bites per meal down, then you're not eating enough.<p>At peak training (for me) an example diet would look like this:<p>Morning: 6 eggs (free-range), 4 strips of bacon (only happy pigs), two apples, one pear, and a little cup of almond butter.<p>Pre-lunch snack: half a bag of cashews and/or a few Kind Bars and 48 grams of protein in a shake.<p>Lunch: usually something I've cooked the night before, like Coconut Curry, Chili, steak or chicken. I always eat bacon to get my fat - some of these dishes will have been made with it, if I'm just eating steak I'll have 3-4 slices of bacon with it. To get my carbohydrates I fall back on fruits and sweet-potatoes. I'll have two sweet-potatoes and an apple, usually, with the above type of meal.<p>Pre-dinner snack: 48 grams of protein in a shake.<p>Dinner: similar to lunch, it will be some paleo meal that has been cooking in the Crock Pot all day or something I already made with enormous amounts of protein and fat in it. Again I get a lot of my calories from sweet-potatos and fruit so for dinner I'll usually eat a lot of berries, pears, sweet-potato fries, &c...<p>This type of diet is 100% gluten free and 100% refined sugar free and HFCS free; I also try to eat organic/free-range where I can. There are some instances where it just gets too expensive for me and have to buy some veggies/fruits that are not organic.",1353947351

[...] Not so low they are not worth doing, but low enough they won't support a rapid growth and investment seeking startup.</i><p>I think we agree on the basic situation, just perhaps have a different idea of the scale.<p>To me, having a business that has merely millions of potential paying customers, but where those customers have a particular interest in what you're offering and there is relatively little competition because you really are  doing something new, is worth more by any metric I care about than having a business with billions of potential paying customers who have no particular interest in what you're offering and dozens of competitors offering something similar. About the only metric where this doesn't come out on top in B2C world is ""probability of hitting it out of the park"", which is of interest to VCs and serial entrepreneurs playing the long game, but possibly not so relevant if you're just trying to start a successful business for yourself.<p>Your comment about ""in an efficient world"" is interesting, because I think this is where the received wisdom breaks down: the real world is nowhere close to an idealised efficient economy. Many people have the skills to use modern technology effectively, but a lot of them are working for someone else in some large business, and the overheads of that large business make many of these smaller projects commercially unappealing. The ""correct"" economic response for the people with the skills to take advantage of the market that would pay for them is for those people to break away and set up their own small, efficient businesses that can then make a very tidy profit by genuinely helping a lot of people who are below the radar of big business.<p>Of course, that requires skills other than technical ones, and an awareness of the possibilities, and a willingness to take a risk with your income when perhaps you have a mortgage to pay and a family to support, and all of those things influence what actually happens. But that is why there really are still a lot of very lucrative (by individual/small business standards) opportunities out there for those who are willing and able to make that jump.",1353947000

4832527,comment,4831566,4832332,8,0,nlavezzo,,,"ACID and NoSQL are not mutually exclusive, although that is a common misconception due to the fact that almost all NoSQL databases gave up ACID in exchange for BASE (eventual consistency), making the development of their distributed databases much easier. However, ACID is simply a set of properties that allows you to group a set of reads & writes to a database into a transaction that is Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable. That set of reads & writes does not need to be SQL - in our case, it is a set of reads from and writes to a database of ordered keys and values.<p>For example, you could read the values associated with keys ""a"" and ""b"" and ""c"" and based on that information, make a change to the values associated with keys ""c"" and ""d"" and then commit the transaction. The transaction then either fails completely (if one of the keys you read had been written to since your read, in which case you re-try the transaction) or succeeds completely. That is an ACID transaction in a (NoSQL) key-value store.",1353946289

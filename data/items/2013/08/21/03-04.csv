Little seats that don&#x27;t recline <i>all the way</i> are a recipe for back pain, neck pain, or just general low-grade misery, as if air travel isn&#x27;t annoying enough.

The same thing happened with Saturday stay-overs on round trips (I don&#x27;t know if they still do this) or one-way tickets being as or more expensive than round trips, because business customers often prefer to be home on weekends.<p>All that said, I generally book business and upgrade myself to first, so I&#x27;m not feeling the full $10-15k pressure myself.  Also, I only book international first on vacations, when it&#x27;s miles/points anyway, for which the spendy fares help out a lot.<p>Plus, I really don&#x27;t want to fight with 500 people over two toilets.

I would strongly recommend dealing with a good therapist.  I am not anti-medicine in general, but the pill-pushing side of psychriatry is very primitive and not really helpful.<p>Basically all of the medicines work by tweaking how your neurons react to various neurotransmitters, either at transmission or reception.  The problem is, these don&#x27;t target, their effect is throughout the entire neurosystem.<p>One of the best sources of information I have seen it Sapolsky&#x27;s lectures on YouTube, he is a professor at Stanford.  He does a really good job explaining what is actually going on inside the body, although it can be difficult to read further without a solid grasp of biochemistry.  I did pretty well in organic chemistry in college, and got A&#x27;s in it, but never took actual classes in biochemistry, only read books in my spare time on that, and I have had some difficulty sometimes.<p>Basically what I am trying to say is be careful, psych meds can really ruin your life if they aren&#x27;t perfectly balanced, and it it almost impossible to get them perfectly balanced even if you have the best psychriatrists in the world, and you probably won&#x27;t have the best.

First are the actual tablets themselves.<p>Paper is cheap and reliable; a restaurant dropping a lot of money on a number of tablets is going to be a tough pill to swallow for many. In a tiny looking place like Bumble, not a big deal. But what about a sixty seat restaurant -- do you need one for every table? How many extras do you need to keep on hand? Does it stay on the table the whole night (which would make sense)? Do you have to spray them all with that new hydrophobic stuff to keep them clean and working? Do they all need otterboxes to survive the fall from the table? Are they going to be completely locked down so there&#x27;s no incentive to steal the tablets?<p>I see the color coded table thing. When are servers going to be looking at this, is there a &quot;server station&quot; tablet, too? This also means that the expo in the kitchen is going to have to be trained and be running this device. Will there be a screen in the kitchen, paper dupes for the line cooks?<p>How much time do customers have to change their order.. is there some final check or something before it becomes an official &quot;order?&quot; Do the customers have to worry about seat numbers; how does this not turn into a food auction?<p>While I hope this would let service staff be even MORE knowledgeable about the menus (as they have less work to do), I hope it doesn&#x27;t make them lazier (&quot;I&#x27;m just a glorified food runner now&quot;).<p>Concerns aside, it&#x27;s very cool to be able to update things in real time and I always think reading specials is preferable to hearing the speech from the server.<p>edit: Okay well I was quick to post and did the further reading which answers some, but not all of these questions. I still think it&#x27;s an interesting idea that will have a niche for sure (there&#x27;s plenty of wine lists on tablets and the like), but the execution will play a major part in the success, I think. Also, even if Buttersystems is the best freaking thing since sliced bread, getting restaurants to train and use it effectively is the real tricky part of this, I think.",1377056407

This is why cookbooks don&#x27;t have recipes with &quot;if you cooked it too long here, switch to this recipe...&quot;<p>Hell, this goes so far as to how we currently give people directions to cross a state.  Consider <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/4F89Z"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/maps/4F89Z</a>  This clearly doesn&#x27;t work because there is not a car that can do that trip completely non-stop (well, that I know of).  Yet, it would be silly to even try and account for all of the random stops that a person making that trip would want to do.  How is this the fault of &quot;embracing integers, strings, lists and trees?&quot;<p>Having looked over all of the various ways that we give directions to kids lately, I&#x27;m becoming more and more convinced that the higher theories of programming are missing something (for a great presentation on this idea, see [1]).  Look at how music is written.  Look at how lego directions are written.  Ikea directions.  Shampoo directions.  Cooking recipes.  All of these are relatively successful methods for communicating often complicated sets of directions.  None of them necessarily encode things to the level of detail that our programs require.<p>Are you concerned that all of my examples are not necessarily life and death detail oriented?  See the blueprints of rockets.  Sail boat designs from ancient times.  Heck, sailing routes.<p>If anything, I would say that our programs should, instead of offering fancy ways to escape the consequences, programs should offer ways to &quot;get back on the desired path&quot; of what was supposed to be accomplished.  The canonical &quot;FileNotFound?&quot;  Don&#x27;t put my program somewhere where I have to somehow set things back up to try again.  Resume right here once the file has been found.  (Sadly, I don&#x27;t have any good thoughts on this.  Just late night ramblings.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/We-Really-Dont-Know-How-To-Compute"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/We-Really-Dont-Know-How-T...</a>",1377055025

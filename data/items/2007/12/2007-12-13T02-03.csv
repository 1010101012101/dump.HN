88979,comment,88946,88946,0,0,boucher,,,"""Is there any reason to code the pages by hand anymore for a frequently updated site?""<p>There hasn't been a reason to hand code anything that is at all dynamic or frequently updated for a decade.  There's a reason PHP is so popular after all.<p>That being said, any HTML/CSS that has to do with layout is still best done by hand.  <p>On the spectrum of tools available, what most people are looking for is a hand-coded layout/template with something like wordpress/moveable type generating the content.",1197513753

Lame isn't respectable, interesting, or memorable. It's not even failure.<p>Failure is privilege. I hope everyone out there keeps working hard and keeps hopeful even though A and B couldn't quite get to X this time.",1197513634

On the assumption that you're given the array length (or else that the array is of fixed size), you don't need to hand-unroll the loop, which wouldn't handle a variably-sized array anyway.<p>But I agree that it's a bad interview question.",1197513545

All of the ""personals"" on the main page are clearly fake, only there to sucker people in to join the site.

88963,comment,88711,88711,0,0,abossy,,,"You are telling me that I have to learn to code in Javascript? Are you serious? I've been avoiding Javascript for years. Abstractions such as libraries make this possible. This seems like a step backward. <p>What I saw ""Make Simple Web Apps A Breeze,"" I expected Infogami done correctly. Drag and drop some buttons to make a website, publish it to an account, and voila, I have a website. <p>Don't get me wrong, the premise is very cool. It gets my computer science geekery excited. But this is a business here, and it seems like a tool built for geeks by geeks. I don't know what the business model, but based on every other venture YC has backed, it depends on the typical Web 2.0 paradigm: get users --> get funding --> ultimately get ad-based revenue or other branch out to other forms. If your only target is geeks, then good luck. Otherwise, I suggest a little more ease-of-use.<p>From the few examples I quickly browsed, nothing is out of the ordinary; a chat program, a wiki, a ""notes"" page, etc... All common Web paradigms that can be abstracted.<p>Again, very cool, and I look forward to playing around with it once my semester ends. But at the moment, I don't think anybody but the hardcore techies will enjoy it.",1197512258

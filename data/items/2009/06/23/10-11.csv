670118,comment,669761,670063,0,0,dave_au,,,"Google Reader is Google's feed reader, and its users can choose to share items that they read.  The sharing is/was done by clicking ""Share"" on relevant items in your feeds, and you could give other people a unique URL (containing random looking characters, possibly just an obfuscation of your username, who knows) and they could check your shared items or even subscribe to them.<p>People used it for all kinds of things - political news pieces for likeminded friends, some spouses shared raunchy things, some dude even made it part of his business.<p>One day Google decided that all of your friends should be able to see your shared items.  And that your friends are everyone you've ever sent email to from your gmail account.  This caused a bit of anguish for a fair few people - family rifts, job issues, etc...<p>The official workaround was to either unshare the items or delete people from your contacts list.  Sometime after that they added the ability to not have everyone you've every contacted be your friend, and now I believe there's an option to opt-in to the feature and then select who gets to see it.<p>No trace of an apology to anyone, and the thread of angry people in the reader google group basically got admonished for believing that the pseudorandom looking URL that only the user had access to in anyway implied that the data was private.  If the shared page was www.google.com/readers/[username] that'd be fair enough I guess.<p>For some people it was as big a deal as making everyones email readable by any and all, and there wasn't any kind of official response that acknowledged it was a misstep, let alone apologizing.<p>I figured since it was around a month after the Beacon fiasco at Facebook that they'd decided that an apology would get them bad PR and so they just ignored the upset people.  I switched to Bloglines, and I imagine quite a few of the people who were effected by or noticed what happened did as well.",1245754413

I have no idea how the mathematics professor calculated his odds, but they're not correct.<p>A collision happens any time two seven-digit numbers are identical.  They don't both have to be 3511587.  They could have just as easily been 3511586, for example.<p>If the lottery ticket contains a 7-digit number and only the digits 1-9 are allowed, then the probability of a collision is 1 in 9^7, or roughly 1 in 4.8 million.<p>Of course, I agree with the commenter above who hypothesized that it wasn't truly random chance; the ""current time as random seed"" sounds awfully likely.",1245752200

She may well be wrong, but he needs to explain why he thinks so.\n3) MS may be willing to invest heavily in search, but throwing money at something does not guarantee results.\n4) Yahoo can afford deals such as the one MS has made with Verizon - especially as the wording he quotes implies that the payments are being made over a period of years and are likely to be covered by the revenues it generates. If MS is willing to make unprofitable deals to gain share it will make Yahoo weaker in that market, but he gives no evidence of that.\n5) Yahoo has huge amounts of traffic, and a lot of good products.

Even if one could, what exactly are they trying to show? Relative popularity? There are better measures that do not include grosses.<p>The biggest issue though with comparing a movie that came out a month ago with a movie that came out 80 years ago is that movie has had 80 years of releases and re-releases in which to make that sum. It would be much more fair to compare everything to how it did in the first month of availability (though even then you have problems with judging how widely distributed a movie was initially). Also, the site doesn't make clear if, when taking into account re-releases, they adjust everything at the price level of the original release or if they judge each re-release at the new price level.<p>In the end, though, any sort of historical comparison is a silly exercise that tells us little.",1264571490

Even more unfortunately, most books are written in the following style:<p>1. Here's a paragraph-long definition that makes no sense to you at this point.<p>2. Here's a proof of this thing you don't yet understand.<p>3. Oh, you want to practice? Here's an example problem and a solution. When you see a problem like this one, plug numbers into this formula in the bold box.<p>4. A bunch more problems to try plugging numbers into yourself.<p>5. The discussion on what this thing is actually useful for is outside the scope of this book. Read about that somewhere else.<p>The best teachers actually explain how the thing they are teaching works. They start with a limited concept the student can understand, and then refine it to make it more formal. Good textbooks do this too. The bad ones start with the definition in a box.<p>The problem is that by the time a professor writes a textbook, this stuff is second nature to them. The prof is an expert. So he/she starts with the definition, since that is how the professor commonly communicates this concept. The book then ends up looking like the author is trying to make him/herself look smart at the expense of the reader.

Bing! of course, is owned by the company that Canonical seeks to upend with its 2-3% market share in the Operating System Market.

The reason was that I felt comfortable enough with their current skill set that I knew I could not only mentor them to transition in another language, but they could become really strong. Truthfully speaking, I never once saw a negative recourse from one of those decisions (thank goodness!).""<p>Contractors have even more reason to identify themselves as an X developer.  Most contractors get paid for what they can do ""right now.""  They don't get paid to learn a new language  or for any transitioning period.  In most cases, a contractor just needs to get the job done.",1264568946

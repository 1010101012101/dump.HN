It is an excellent read which explains how the container came to be - it&#x27;s really fascinating to think that this ubiquitous thing was only invented about 50 years ago.<p>The book is very entertaining and informative, though it has a rather US-centric approach (being Danish, I obviously looked for when Maersk would be introduced, but they are barely mentioned). I especially enjoyed the explanations of how shipping worked before &quot;the box.&quot; Dockworkers&#x27; unions were extremely powerful, to the extent of introducing ridiculous rules. E.g. &quot;seven people must be assigned to each hatch on the ship, even if there is not enough for them to move there, and they are not allowed to help crews at other hatches.&quot; They went to extreme lengths to protect their jobs, and ultimately failed because they would not accept that they could not stop the container.<p>[1] <a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/Box-Shipping-Container-Smaller-Economy/dp/0691136408/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423655225&sr=8-1&keywords=the+box+marc+levinson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smile.amazon.com/Box-Shipping-Container-Smaller-Econo...</a>",1423655814

9032350,comment,9029301,9029301,0,0,greggman,,,"I&#x27;m firmly on the &quot;legalize drugs&quot; side if only to get rid of the crime since that&#x27;s more relevant to me.<p>That said, one of the &quot;keep drugs illegal&quot; guys from this debate (<a href=""http://www.intelligencesquared.com/events/versus-drugs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intelligencesquared.com/events/versus-drugs/</a>) basically claimed legal drugs kill people. Tobacco is used by 1/3 of humanity and kills 5 million people a year. Alcohol is used by 1/4 of humanity and kills 2.5 million people. 1/20th of humanity uses illegal drugs, that includes people who claim to only use it once a year, and the drugs kill 0.5 million people a year. In other words legal drugs kill 10x the people of illegal drugs. So he extrapolates that if we legalize drugs real deaths by them will go up by as much as 10x.<p>He also believes after you legalize it the full force of big pharma and VCs and banks and big tobacco will be unleashed on promoting and marketing it. He claims you can google these plans and you can google the lobbyists talking to politicians about all the tax revenue that will come in by making it as big as alcohol etc.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I agree. I have no idea. The idea of it being promoted can be argued away by saying only the government will sell it. Maybe? Here in California there are plenty of shady stores offering instant consultation with a doctor to get your medical approval so you can then buy from them. The point being businesses are popping up. I have no idea what it would take for a giant company to decide to run this stuff.<p>Others claimed the crime deaths offset the drug deaths although if you check the stats they arguably won&#x27;t be close. Even a doubling of drug deaths will be far more than drug related crime deaths.<p>You can also just claim you&#x27;re more interested in a reduction in crime and even if more people die from drug related accidents. Of course if it&#x27;s a reduction in theft related crime that&#x27;s great but of course more intoxicated people could mean more unintentional deaths like drunk drivers?<p>Anyway, like I said I&#x27;m still firmly on the &quot;legalize&quot; side.

Combined with the fact that I was writing OSX software, it made sense to buy a MacBook and virtualise all the OSes I was running, so Windows and my ancient comfortable version of Linux have their VMs still running.<p>You&#x27;re right though - it&#x27;s impossible to change the UI on OSX (other than grey or blue for the buttons, that is all, and now with a &quot;dark&quot; menubar which I like) and Windows is limited. I too keep my proper Windows dualboot partition for playing games (hurray for Homeworld Remastered this month eh!).<p>I think once we&#x27;ve been exposed to other OSes and use them daily for different things (I used to maintain racks of Linux and Windows servers of differing ages, some ancient machines along with new), the differences sort of fade and the rabid fanboyism for each OS gets wearisome.

I mean, GP&#x27;s first complaint, my emphasis:<p>>Windows is a <i>proprietary ecosystem</i> where choices are made for the benefit of microsoft&#x27;s shareholders and nobody else.<p>All software distributors make choices for someone&#x27;s benefit, maybe sometimes even for the users&#x27;, but the difference with <i>non proprietary ecosystems</i>, like Linux, is that users can make their own choices if they don&#x27;t like the ones made for them. Sometimes this requires coordinated effort (like forking gnome2) that can sometimes be so effortful it might as well be as out of reach as changing choices in the closed ecosystem, but many other times it&#x27;s as simple as installing a different desktop environment through your distro&#x27;s package manager. What if I don&#x27;t like the new look of Windows or OS X? I can choose not to upgrade <i>the entire platform</i>, but that&#x27;s it, unlike in Linux land where I can upgrade piecemeal. It&#x27;s even worse if I don&#x27;t like a webapp&#x27;s new look -- I can&#x27;t even use the old version. I can of course stop using it. Great choice that, when it&#x27;s the only alternative to &#x27;tolerate&#x27;.<p>I agree with you that it&#x27;s silly to say no one genuinely in a non-fanboy way likes Windows. (I live with such a person.) Personally I find Windows intolerable for anything but playing games on Steam and NoMachining into a Linux workstation. If my day-job was programming C# applications, I&#x27;d probably tolerate Visual Studio too. If that was my hobby and all my time was with Windows, and I forgot all I know of the Linux world, and like my housemate I installed various 3rd-party tools to change the boneheaded choices Microsoft occasionally makes (this does make my last paragraph hyperbole) then I might even like Windows as a whole.",1423652513

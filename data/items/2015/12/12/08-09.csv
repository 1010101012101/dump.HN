It seems to me that the more hours one spends solving real problems with AI, the less likely they are to believe an apocalypse is imminent.  Conversely, the more dependent a prognosticator is on book or film sales, the more likely they are to predict or depict a near-term AI apocalypse.<p>[1] Google Talk: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nDdqGUMdAY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nDdqGUMdAY</a>",1449910638

10722183,comment,10720349,10721473,0,0,crdb,,,"My experience hiring and working with Haskell developers - and those trying to get up to speed - is that one cannot just &quot;learn Haskell in 2 months&quot; as you might say, pick up Ruby after you already have significant Python, Java and C++ experience.<p>It is however relatively unique to Haskell and similar languages whose paradigm is very different to what most of the market is used to.<p>Everything is an optimization over a number of variables.<p>The upside of Haskell is that (if you make an effort) you get very good people and they don&#x27;t cost as much because there is comparatively less demand for the language, so even on a greenfield project it makes sense to give it a shot. This is aside from numerous language-specific benefits which have been discussed to death in the never ending language wars.<p>The downside is that only a portion of the self-defined Haskell community can truly be more productive in Haskell than say, Python; and these people have many options and are themselves making trade-offs and optimizing across a variety of variables when picking a job (e.g. interesting machine learning work in Python vs boring CRUD work in Haskell, given the same salary, might rank about the same). If you find these people, if they want to work for you, you get good results. But you&#x27;re bidding against Google and hedge funds, so you need to find an edge that they cannot take advantage of. For example, I saw almost no CVs with prestigious universities on them, because that&#x27;s a common filter in prestigious organisations, who tend to miss out on the self-taught talent and the less well ranked alumni; those with &quot;prestigious&quot; CVs wait for organisations to get in touch rather than having to sell themselves. So it&#x27;s probably a good idea to avoid using university as a filter.<p>One reason there are many Haskell job openings in comparably fragile settings (low budget, bad politics, low stakes etc.) is because in cases where resources are ample (thus allowing for time for senior people to learn a new language or junior people to learn professional software development skills), the risk-taking appetite is less and managers will hedge by going for the popular instead of taking a &quot;Python paradox&quot;/blub bet. A cynical reason for this might also be that you do not want to be dependent on a small number of talented people - having a large team of replaceable junior talent hedges against the developers acquiring strong negotiating power by virtue of adding too much value, or even just the risk that a car crash wipes out half your codebase.<p>In some ways the survivability of the organisation in the low-resource setting is then dependent on the Haskeller - if you help your employer increase its conversion rate or customer lifetime value 10-fold, or reduce dev ops and infrastucture cost by a factor of 10, you might well change the very dynamics of the business and justify your team and salary; so it might make sense to take a less attractive posting if you know this is a possibility. At the same time, there are numerous companies arguing this to try and get you to accept a pay cut.",1449908783

10722162,comment,10721371,10721934,0,0,mitchellh,,,"As the founder of HashiCorp, I feel qualified to answer this.<p>The adjacent comment about Atlas is correct. Atlas itself is admittingly poorly marketed (something we&#x27;re working on right this very moment) right now. The best way to describe how we make money is: we target the enterprise user and give them the features, integrations, and support they need in their regulated, legacy-encumbered, etc. environments. Atlas in particular is focused on giving enterprises a flexible application delivery pipeline that is opinionated in a certain way, but flexible enough to support their diverse environments (all at once: containers, VMs, physical machines. Windows, Mac, Linux. Etc.)<p>Due to our adoption we have the rare benefit of primarily letting open source adoption happen organically, and having large companies approach us as they get more serious about our software.<p>Vault, in particular, is a good example of this. Vault suffers from an issue where most impressive people who use Vault can&#x27;t actually publicly say they use Vault. So we have a hard time talking about how widely adopted it is. The best I can give you is from what I said at our HashiConf keynote: &quot;If you traded stocks, used a credit card, or did anything involving a bank, then you&#x27;ve interacted with Vault-secured data.&quot; As specific as I can be as to how widely spread Vault is right now.<p>Anyways, a digression from the original question: enterprises have interesting needs they&#x27;re willing to pay for. We address those needs in enterprise products (Atlas, others that aren&#x27;t public yet) and support. We don&#x27;t have any SaaS-like &quot;enter your credit card and pay us&quot; (other than the Vagrant VMware plugin which predates all of this), and instead do deals with larger companies in a way that most of HN would likely perceive as old school in some sense. :)<p>Note when I say &quot;enterprise&quot; I&#x27;m not trying to exclude anyone. If you&#x27;re a relatively small company (I didn&#x27;t click your name to find out), then still feel free to email us any of your concerns and we should be able to either help you ourselves or route you in the right direction.",1449908025

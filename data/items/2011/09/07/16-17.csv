In biology, it's similar to blood.  I'm not sure a transportation analog works but it might (I need to think about that).<p>Money works when it is exchanged for goods and services.<p>When money stops moving, the economy ""stops"".  There isn't any exchange going on (or there's far less than before). Economic activity slows, employment slows, etc.<p>Credit and leverage, done right, allow more work from a given initial money supply (technically, credit increases the money supply), but this is predicated on the borrower repaying the initial investment. Done wrong, credit is extended for activities which don't allow repayment, and not only can't the the interest be paid, but the initial principle is lost -- and the money supply contracts.<p>Money is <i>not</i> wealth (value imbued in goods/services), but it can be (with a stable currency) a <i>measure</i> of wealth.<p>If the amount of money in circulation is decreasing (or the real wealth of an economy is increasing relative to a fixed money supply, say, with a gold/silver standard), then the <i>value</i> of a given denomination of coinage increases. Hoarding coin/currency/money becomes a wealth-accruing activity, while facilitating economic activity (by spending money) largely <i>loses</i> wealth. Hence the problem with a highly deflationary currency.<p>Economic theory says you want a currency whose value tends to be stable, or slightly inflationary, with time, in order to encourage spending rather than saving.<p>Note that none of this addresses the underlying physical economy, resource limitations/depletion, or other criticisms of traditional orthodox economics (most of which are highly valid -- we live on a planet of limited resources and good planets are both hard to find and the commute is a real drag).<p>Regarding your comments on savings: yes, there is a well-known ""savings paradox"" where individual incentives to save are opposed to the overall economic goals of growth. This is one of many such individual/group paradoxes, and is one of the principle reasons for laws (legal, moral, or otherwise).  The 1971 book <i>The Logic of Collective Action</i> by Mancur Olson is one of the better illuminations of the concept: <a href=""http://economics.about.com/cs/macroeconomics/a/logic_of_action.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economics.about.com/cs/macroeconomics/a/logic_of_acti...</a><p>There are numerous other conflicts and paradoxes within economic theory and reality.

It started in 2006 when I started a web development firm with my room mate. (Disclosure: Partnerships are hard.)  We had a couple of clients then things were shaky. This lasted until 2007 in which he enrolled back in school and I followed suite. Personally, it took me a while to get into school as the intro classes held such little interest to me, could have been the teachers, to me they moved at a slow pace.<p>Then in 2008 after completing two years of my undergrad, I landed upon an interactive agency (start-up) through my connections I made with my own company earlier (Never underestimate the power of networking.) I invested in the company and we had a very nice office and great client database. That was certainly a peak time for me and were fruits of my freelance labor.<p>I cut out some of the rough times I have had, as they were certainly there, being a freelancer or being involved with a start-up is a lot of grunt work. Sometimes it was bill collecting or having to deal with unrealistic demands from clients, etc.<p>It all really depends what you want out of life. Do you want a structured and not so shaky career path? Are you will to take risks? Is anyone financially dependent on you? If you have a good deal of freedom then I say go for it, because those times will change and you can always go back to school.<p>I also agree with ziyadb, if anything drop the music.  You can program a computer to play music anyway. :)",1315412881

2970082,comment,2969568,2969960,3,0,danenania,,,"""The answer is yes (with qualifiers). Many late adopters are late adopters because they are holding out for a cheaper price for those goods. From personal experience, I've done this very thing (waiting for prices to come down on a TV before I bought it). I put that money into something with a higher return for the time being.""<p>But you could have kept waiting and prices would have kept falling. Eventually you spent your money anyway. This seems to indicate that it wasn't the situation of falling prices that prevented you from buying a TV, since that never changed, but some external factor.<p>""But, the reason that's not exactly a fair comparison is that the currency itself (in this case, USD) was not deflating. Ergo, my ""hoarding"" was actually putting it into something with a better return for the time being, which was available because the currency was stable. If the best return I could get was holding on to my money (instead of putting it in some sort of investment vehicle), then that would be deflation.""<p>The currency was deflating relative to TVs. Holding cash <i>does</i> provide a better return than holding a TV. The value of a TV depreciates much faster than cash. That's the point--why would anyone ever buy a TV when if they just held onto their money for a month they could always get a <i>better</i> TV for the same amount? Since TV prices are <i>always</i> falling, this question reduces to: why would anyone ever buy a TV? The answer is pretty simple--people want TVs. At some point if they want one, they're just going to buy one regardless of what the prices are doing, just like you did. So where's the problem?",1315411851

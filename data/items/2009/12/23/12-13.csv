1011969,comment,1011685,1011685,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"And the distraction of MS continues.... Microsoft really needs some focus. Their incessant desire to go after every single area of the consumer space (no matter the cost) is a massive drag on their ability to execute. Contrast that with a company like Oracle, who as far as I know makes zero consumer-facing products. Likewise, both Google and Apple are just not competitive with MS in the corporate space. Nibbling around the edges? Sure. But serious competition? Not really. Google's mail hosting is probably the only spot where MS faces genuine competition from google, but they are at a disadvantage there because IT shops (especially ones in places where privacy is paramount like healthcare) are very reluctant to let all that email go outside their walls.<p>What MS really needs, is to make Windows Server so compelling that even a unix guy like me looks at it and says, ""You know, that would be way better than putting my stuff on Linux"". That's a tall order, but it's possible (at least with the non-religious side of the Linux user base).",1261571289

But we hit a philosophical problem. If clojure is object oriented because it can do all the stuff that oo languages can do, then oop becomes a meaningless metaphor, just a name for a set of common sense ideas. Oop NEEDS to be defined in terms of traditional object systems(with classes and methods and stuff like that) in order to make sense as a paradigm. If you define oop as ""a general metaphor in which everything is an object and objects interact with each other via message passing"" you can implement it in a variety of ways, all of which would be object oriented.<p>Simply put, if you don't have the concrete mechanics, the name you had for the result doesn't make sense anymore. Wow, i knew oop was a vaguely defined term, but i didn't know just how fragile its definition was until i started writing this comment.",1261571147

I work in web development, and I see <i>every single day</i> confusion and problems caused by a mismatch between what someone asked for and what someone else understood they wanted.<p>When you're writing computer code you <i>should</i> specify exactly what you want - architects don't design a house by drawing four walls and a roof and some rough, to-the-nearest-metre dimensions on the back of an envelope, because then houses would fall down and kill people.<p>We shouldn't design software this way for the same reasons.<p>The main problem is that people are lazy, and think in generalities.  That's fine for socialising, but many things in life require precision (especially in our increasingly-complex society)... and lazy people used to relying on implication and inference find it a great effort to be as precise as is required.<p>The solution is not for programming languages to guess what people want based off their imperfect, imprecise and un-thought-through requests - it's for people to learn to request <i>what they actually want</i>, instead of asking computers to essentially ""do some stuff with a thing"".<p>It's not a question of success of communication - it's a question of imprecise requirements, lossy communication methods and inescapable rules of information theory.",1261570860

Idiots won't succeed anyway but inconveniences harm professionals and novices.<p>I think you've misunderstood - the argument is not to keep inconvenience <i>in</i>, it's to avoid taking things <i>out</i> which aren't actually a problem in practice.<p>As you rightly said, ""human languages are geared towards interactive communication not towards describing problems and solutions precisely"".  Therefore any attempt to turn a programming language into English is not going to address the real difficulties of programming - specifying the problem and solution in enough detail, modelling the desired system in your head, avoiding/considering/handling edge-cases, etc.<p>All it's going to do is to make the experience of programming fractionally easier for people with effectively zero programming skills, and hence give them unwarranted self-confidence.<p>It's like making a bike easier to ride by gluing the rider to the seat - sure it's technically ""harder to fall off"", but the problem isn't usually the rider falling off the seat - it's the whole bike falling over, taking the rider with it.<p>Likewise, the hard part of programming isn't remembering precise and finicky syntax - it's making sure your own thinking is precise and finicky enough that you can accurately <i>express</i> it in such a finicky, precise language.<p>I'm not arguing in favour of long function names (I'm not entirely sure how you got that from my post) - I'm arguing against people who think that by changing ""print('Hi there');"" to ""print 'Hi there'"" they've somehow solved the problem of ""programming being hard to do"".",1261570409

You don't even have the ability to disengage your alpha limiters until mission 5 or 6 (the one presented in the demo).  As for the HUD vector thing?  It's useful at certain points in the game, but it's best employed in the campaign during a couple of really awesome sequences where they require you to use it.<p>My biggest gripe is that it was short.  But I think there's some major replayability in there, particularly if you get some buddies to fly wingman.",1239939969

566350,comment,565703,566070,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I have a (rather battered) signed copy of Jackson. Some friends of mine in grad school heard he was coming to town for some physics seminar, so we all went to the Ithaca airport, waited for him to come in, and got his autograph.<p>Man, was that my all-time personal peak of geekiness. Jackson himself was quite bemused.<p>If we're going to name-drop great physics teachers and texts, though, let me recommend Roald Hoffman. His course in bonding in solids was my favorite science course ever -- and he even wrote a book! (""Solids and Surfaces"") It was the highest-numbered course in the chemistry department -- the one where chemistry and physics become aspects of the same thing -- and he used a deliberately simplified but intuitively clear computational model and a great many examples to give you a mental picture of how bonding works, and how band structure is a special case of chemical bonding. One of these days I've got to reread that book.<p>Amusingly, I signed up and took Hoffman's course without even knowing, at the time, that the guy had won a Nobel prize and hosted a PBS series. Cornell could work that way sometimes.<p>(God, textbooks are criminally priced. I just discovered that my copy of <i>Solids and Surfaces</i> is worth $100, <i>used</i>, on Amazon. That's awful. As if recommending graduate-level science textbooks wasn't hard enough...)",1239939890

566343,comment,565206,566305,0,0,bokonist,,,"I haven't read the books you've mentioned, although I'm pretty familiar with the debate, and the latest arguments.<p>I think it's interesting to make an analogy with a sport like running.  If you measure running ability in a group where every person has absolutely no training, all the differential in running ability will be genetic.  But a person will be able to train and improve, and so a change in environment ran result in gains in ability.  If some people in the group start to train harder, then the differential in scores will be a mix of environmental and genetic.<p>If you compare members of a cross country team who all endure the same grueling training, the differences in their running speeds will be genetic.  If one member tries to train even harder, he will probably be unable to raise his speed even higher.  At some point, he maxes out and no training will raise his speed even further.<p>The subtests that have a flat trend were vocab, math, and general knowledge.  What this indicates is that the environment of a century ago maxed people out at these skills a century ago.  This is not surprising, as these skills are the most culturally common skills.  Even in 1900 a person had constant exposure to reading, math, and general knowledge.<p>The subtests that have seen the greatest rise are all obscure skills - object assembly, picture arrangement, similarities.  My guess is that the great increase in schooling resulted in more training in these obscure skills.  Increased availability of games and puzzle books also helped.  In 1900 if you were a genius kid, you read the classics.  In 2009 you can play all sorts of fun puzzle games online or in books.  As a result of this, scores on these obscure puzzles have gone up.<p>The net of this may mean that the hardcore hereditarians ( Murray, Jensen) are wrong about the specifics but right about the big picture.  They are wrong to think that differences in the Raven test <i>by themselves</i> mean that one group has more natural cognitive abilities than another group.  But they are probably right that individual and group differences in the <i>economically and socially useful</i> cognitive skills are mostly genetic.  The differences in the obscure cognitive skills ( Raven's, picture arrangement) may be much more environmental.",1239939220

566339,comment,566086,566329,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I actually later managed to play the first 4 missions on a borrowed copy... I stand by my impression of the game :) It's decent fun if you have no other game to compare it with, but coming in as a fan of the genre (Ace Combat et al) it was a sore disappointment.<p>Aircraft handling felt sticky, and I found myself fighting it constantly just to point the plane in the right direction - which may do well in a realistic sim, but this is an arcade game. The ""evasion vector"" feature is also kind of pointless - if you relied on it to get an attack vector on every opponent you would <i>never</i> pass the missions, seeing as it takes a solid 30 seconds to lock onto your opponent.<p>Both art style and setting could use some work also. Ace Combat 6 (which is the only real same-gen same-platform comparable game) had the skies filled with hundreds upon hundreds of enemies, and it felt like a real <i>battle</i> (unrealistic as that may be). HAWX felt like miles of nothingness with a few bogeys (which is more realistic, but less fun).",1239938559

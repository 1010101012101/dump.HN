Many would rather be accepted than exceptional  At some point in your life, you may have to make that choice.<p>The problem with public opinion in our times is this idea that the crowd is always right.  Something is true because the crowd says it is.  The crowd saying it is, makes it true.  Sane is not the same as true.\nSane just means many people believe it.  The person who believes something no one else does is considered insane.  When the lone &quot;insane&quot; person is vindicated, great wealth and success seem to follow.",1451667575

Many students believe [...] that they should just sit back,</i><p>The important thing is not to take notes per se, but to make sure to engage with the lecture and focus, and fully follow the mathematical argument being presented. Personally I pay attention much better without writing notes, but I know other people who pay attention best while drawing unrelated doodles, or by writing down everything that goes on the chalkboard. If I try to write everything down, the action of mechanical symbol copying takes up brain cycles and prevents me from thinking about what I’m hearing/reading.<p>The “strong correlation” you noticed is because taking notes is a clear signal that the student was paying attention at least enough to write something down. However, you’re looking at a symptom rather than the root cause of the problem. For those students who don’t take notes, some of them might be fully mentally engaged, and others might be daydreaming or checking facebook on their phones. Of course this group is going to do less well on average than the note-taker group when you lump them all together.",1451666993

(Mike also started a product company that utilizes Sails called Treeline.  Full disclosure, I&#x27;ve been to some of their meetups in Austin, they seemed like clever guys.)<p>LinkedIn paints a slightly different picture (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p?f_CC=2604050"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p?f_CC=2604050</a>) with a few more employees listed, including listing both Mike and Travis Webb as &quot;CEO&quot; (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/onnhqqO.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/onnhqqO.png</a>).<p>Given the size of the company, and the fact that the staff seem to be doing other things, I&#x27;d assume someone told Travis, &quot;Hey you can be CEO, but you have to hit some metrics... and if you don&#x27;t you can&#x27;t be CEO any more...&quot;  And given some of the bickery on the other threads... maybe it wasn&#x27;t clear or maybe those metrics weren&#x27;t possible given the range of projects Mike and the other people were working on.  We&#x27;ve all been there... Client says, &quot;Yeah we&#x27;d like to work with you, but... Do A, B, C, and fix X, Y, Z first...&quot; maybe Travis needed Mike&#x27;s help and didn&#x27;t get it.  But who knows, and regardless it sounds like Travis was shown the door.<p>So, and you can see this in the numerous videos where Travis has been promoting Sails the last few years (just Google, he comes up for all the training / discussions around Sails), Travis really liked Sails, and had his feelings hurt because he couldn&#x27;t work on the project he really liked.  And in response, he&#x27;s now saying, &quot;Burn the ships, Sails is dead, everyone come with me to Trails.&quot;<p>Guy goes from being a huge Sails fanboy in hours and hours of videos that are posted online, to coming here 2 weeks later saying, paraphrased, &quot;I&#x27;m going to build my own Sails... with blackjack, and hookers.&quot;  This scenario sucks for everyone.<p>You hire a good dev, someone who knows how to get the technology side done... he offers to step up to a bigger role... but who knows, maybe he can&#x27;t make sales, can&#x27;t retain customers, he isn&#x27;t a leader, or isn&#x27;t focused on the company needs because he&#x27;s only interested in being a dev... but wants the title of CE-something because he&#x27;s 22 and it&#x27;s an ego boost... so rather than leave with dignity, and move on to his next job going back to what he was good at, he is out to sink the people he had been working with.<p>That&#x27;s my read.

He was mightily confused because the man on the other end of the call was asking him questions he had no idea how t answer. After a few moments of confusion, my father told the man, he was pretty sure he wanted his son, Kevin, not him.<p>On the other end waited Ian Murdock. He’d taken the time to call me up to do my Debian maintainer identity interview. It was, and is, a big deal, from a security standpoint, to verify the identity of new Debian maintainers. But the task is tedious, calling up new maintainers and talking to them for half an hour. Imagine my surprise, when, the man doing my interview was <i>the</i> Ian from deb<i>ian</i>. One of the co-founders of the entire project had taken the time to call me. I was Impressed.<p>Years later, I got to meet Ian in person at an ExactTarget conference, and I thanked him for calling a nerdy high school kid to verify his identity. He not only confirmed my identity for security purposes, but he affirmed that I mattered, and could help. At the time, I don’t think he remembered the call, and I don’t think I was sufficiently able to convey what his call meant to me.<p>Last Monday, Ian Murdock was found dead in his home. The details are few, the speculation rampant. Police may or may not be involved. The proximate cause might have been Suicide. Was his Twitter account hacked? Regardless of the details, I’m reminded that all too often our culture judges people by their actions in the worst moments of their life. Those who have killed are forever murderers branded by their actions at the worst moments of their life. We don’t seem to have a cultural construct for good people who made mistakes. Not where suicide or the police are concerned. I’ve already started to see Ian eulogized not for his contributions to the world, but as a “crazy” and someone who gave up. I don’t know how Ian died, it’s likely you don’t either. It doesn’t matter; Ian was more, is more, than the unknown actions at the end of his life. He was also the kind of man who’d not only call and verify my identity, but reaffirm an insecure high school nerd’s ability to meaningfully contribute to the world at large.<p>To Ian, Thank you for all that you were and did.",1451666653

This format is almost always the product of some kind of committee process rather than a primary author with a strong voice.<p>Just because it’s more effective for someone to {quickly skim, think a bit, read the chapter, then think a bit more} doesn’t mean that including those features explicitly in the text is helpful; it’s like taking a full meal and blending it into a smoothie, so the eater doesn’t need to chew. Some students will skip the main text and just read the summary bits, assuming (usually correctly) that that will suffice to pass the next quiz. Others will try to read the book but be distracted by the disjointed presentation and lose track of the shape of the arguments.

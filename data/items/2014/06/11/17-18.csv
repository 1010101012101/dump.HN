I still don&#x27;t understand how this isn&#x27;t industry standard. The process of buying a computer (non-Mac) these days is still as confusing as it&#x27;s ever been without doing hours of research.<p>For instance, how do I compare two PCs:<p>A: Intel Core i7-4770 3.4 GHz and NVIDIA Geforce GT 620\nB: FX-Series Eight-Core FX-8350 4 GHz and NVIDIA GeForce GTX760<p>Even when you clarify some of the parts, it&#x27;s frustrating. What Apple does well (and frankly Dell and some other companies within their own ecosystems) is to add a bit more clarity even if it&#x27;s still a bit opaque (iPhone 5 > iPhone 4, and the fact that all mac parts are relatively similar, just with stair-stepped upgrades).",1402509590

We only have a /10 remaining, and we&#x27;ll only be handing out /24 - /22 allocations!&quot;. Which does seem an awful lot like &quot;flowing freely&quot; (I&#x27;d be happy with just a personal /27 myself) until you put it in context with those early non-aggregable /24 allocations in 192/8 being generally viewed as a mistake for router memory, and the subsequent move to only give out portable allocations to larger service providers.<p>IMHO all of the IPv4 exhaustion articles are basically scaremongering attempting drive adoption ahead of the real pressing need. Which isn&#x27;t the worst goal, as it encourages people to become familiar (have YOU setup a tunnel from he.net, sixxs, or with 6to4/miredo and started playing around?). But I suspect we&#x27;ll be hearing variations on the same &quot;we&#x27;re out! (but not really out)&quot; story for the next 5 years at least.<p>But besides a larger address space, v6 doesn&#x27;t really give new features (besides plausible deniability of what constitutes a host address) and just adds to packet overhead. So the only compelling reason will be the ever growing number of endpoints that are v6 only, and behind NAT (from businesses who decide that providing v4 addresses to new customers by default is too expensive). Other businesses wanting to better serve/track those customers (avoiding NAT64 etc) will then finally have a real reason to treat IPv6 as a first class concern.",1402509316

This was from a time period where there was almost universal consensus that Microsoft&#x27;s horizontal business model (sell the OS and let other companies create hardware to run it on) was thought to have utterly and completely demolished Apple&#x27;s vertical business model (create and sell both the hardware and the software that runs on it) for all time. The narrative was that Microsoft had beaten Apple in large part because the horizontal model was always going to beat the vertical model.<p>In hindsight, it obviously isn&#x27;t that simple- there&#x27;s room for both models in the industry, and each has its own set of risks, rewards, strengths, and weaknesses, all of which are constantly changing as the industry evolves. But yeah, that particular item isn&#x27;t telling Apple to outsource assembly and components, it&#x27;s telling Apple to stop even thinking about hardware and to try to become Microsoft circa 1997.",1402509302

As you found, there&#x27;s a lot of history here. As I remember it, T-Mobile was originally pitching NAT64 because it required no support on the phone at all and DS-Lite would require the phone to do encapsulation. People pointed out that DS-Lite supports v4-only apps and NAT64 does not, but it seems like T-Mobile chose not to hear that argument. Then, having already committed to the NAT64 route, they added a stateless NAT46 agent on the phone to fix v4-only apps.<p>I think that agreeing on a standard is more valuable than continually iterating towards perfection, so I wish the industry had just declared DS-Lite &quot;good enough&quot; and stopped, but now we have this menagerie of transition schemes.",1402509219

7879211,comment,7873414,7873414,1,0,todd8,,,"The discussion of types here is all over the place. This is because they are handled so differently in various programming languages. Pascal included array bounds in the type annotation for arrays and subscripting was enforced (at runtime) to be withing bounds. In C (and C++) arrays are almost equivalent to pointers (the full answer is complicated see [1]) and there is a real danger of buffer overflows. Python doesn&#x27;t include type annotations, but the run-time enforces strong typing, lists carry their type information and will throw an exception if subjected to a non-list operation. The type system in Haskell is perhaps the best example of a really expressive and really effective system for ensuring that the compiler can catch as many error as possible at compile time.<p>Haskell programmers sometimes say that if a program compiles it almost always works. This is interesting, but unfortunately, types and type annotations in use today don&#x27;t fully capture the formal specification needed to guarantee program correctness.<p>Just writing down specification in preparation for a proof of correctness can be difficult. The specifications have to be expressed in a formal system, for example some form of mathematical logic like predicate calculus. Working with anything less than a formal specification is like trying to solve a mathematical set of equations without using math symbols. Natural language is just inadequate to the task. See [2].<p>Getting the specifications right isn&#x27;t easy. I remember my first attempt at proving the correctness of a sorting program. I understood that I needed to insure that A[i] <= A[i+1] for all elements in the array, but I forgot that the final result had to include all and only the original elements (i.e. that it had to be a strict permutation of the input elements). I don&#x27;t believe that type systems are currently useful for these kind of specifications and verifications of program correctness.<p>Real programs interact with the outside world (e.g. GUI&#x27;s are hard to describe mathematically). Real programs often have distributed or concurrent execution for which new logics (like Temporal Logic) may have to be employed. Proving that a program will terminate or make progress or not deadlock or not livelock or will meet some real-time constraints are all exceptionally hard.<p>Many years ago (in the 1980&#x27;s) I worked on this research area at University.  I had the hope that eventually, programming would be more like an interactive exploration with a sophisticated program prover. I thought that the programmer and software-prover would work together to produce a correct program. Today, we are still programming in pretty much the same old ways as back then. The languages are much better, but it&#x27;s a harder problem than I thought it was going to be.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3959705/arrays-are-pointers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3959705/arrays-are-pointe...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/E...</a>",1402507803

With minor tweaks all kde 4 series themes are still usable.<p>Also, the inconsistencies are mostly due to app developers themselves. The difference between plasma and the software compilation can exemplify that - you use two entirely different application stacks if you are developing for one or the other (qt widgets enhanced by kdelibs vs qml enhanced by plasma). And then there are multiple ways to actually develop the app interfaces - you can use anchor based widgets, ui files, or raw custom positioning which I find in reviewing a lot of codebases a bit too common for my liking.<p>When I have the time I try to fix it, though. The problem right now is that while the Qt world&#x27;s future is QML based, the KDE applications and libraries were developed for over a decade around widgets. So when I develop something new I&#x27;m using QML and it can scale, animate, and orient really well for arbitrary window sizes and devices, but some widgets applications just anchor a toolbar to 50px indents and then it looks like puke on high DPI.<p>I mean you can still do that in QML, but the anchors and layouts are so easy to use it seems insane to do so.",1402506433

It is clear that different versions and interpretations exist, especially now we have moved on from behaviorism that was popular during the time Turing wrote the paper.<p>From your quotes it only says that player A is to be replaced with a machine, not that player C is to be made aware of this replacement. I do agree that that is the popular interpretation, but it isn&#x27;t written down, leading to this ambiguity.<p>>the interrogator has to decide which is human and which isn&#x27;t.<p>The interrogator has to decide which is female and which is male. Replace the female or male with a computer, not making the interrogator aware of this and see if the interrogator is wrong as often as before.<p>Kurzweil questions this bot, as if it was a bot. He is aware that he is talking to a bot, and doesn&#x27;t even have to choose between A or B.<p>Kurzweil&#x27;s line of questioning is not fair or normal or productive communication even if it was between two humans. A 13- year-old boy would have told Kurzweil to bugger off when tasked to answer 2+2 or wouldn&#x27;t have responded at all.<p>Repeat questions like that in a random chatroom and people will think that <i>you</i> are the chatbot.",1402506081

It’s getting more common here.<p>In other cases I’m also disturbed by the broken scrolling but in this case my only complaint is the space bar not working. This is a slideshow, but it feels like scrolling because it goes vertically and the scroll bar works. I’m pretty sure if the scroll bar were completely disabled and there was a [next] button with a different transition you wouldn’t complain because you wouldn’t think of it as broken scrolling, but just as another slideshow.<p>So, my suggestion to the author: make it slide horizontally.",1402506065

Redirecting does nothing to reduce excessive traffic, because nobody notices they&#x27;re doing anything wrong. The traffic just keeps coming, and I keep having to redirect it, which doesn&#x27;t help me at all.<p>Displaying an annoying message, on the other hand, gets fast results, because _everyone_ notices and complains.<p>Both rawgit.com and cdn.rawgit.com are completely free (the former paid for out of my own pocket, the latter generously donated by MaxCDN). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask that a person read the prominent instructions before using this free service.<p>For more background on how rawgit&#x27;s abuse prevention works, read this article I wrote about a particularly painful incident: <a href=""https://medium.com/the-javascript-collection/the-naughtiness-score-9a61872c61cd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/the-javascript-collection/the-naughtiness...</a>",1402506046

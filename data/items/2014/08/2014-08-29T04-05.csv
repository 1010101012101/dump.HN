I would even settle for the details of how she did the bucketing, correlations between words and numbers of entries per person, etc.<p>The short answer to why I think that this article isn&#x27;t a real source of data is that the study in it has about the statistical power of just asking everyone who&#x27;s a friend of a friend on Facebook for people with a moderate number of friends.<p>Everyone already knows that there&#x27;s a problem with gender in tech.

8241149,comment,8240886,8240886,2,0,splat,,,"Here in Ohio towing fees are regulated by state law.  Some towing companies were trying to get around the maximum fees they could charge by tacking on an extra &quot;administrative fee&quot; just because.  Fortunately a judge recently ruled that the idea that these fees were legal was &quot;ludicrous.&quot; [1]<p>Even still, tens of thousands of people were charged these fees and many of them will probably never see their money back.  Not to mention the fact that having to pay these fees invariably screwed over some fraction of the victims and led to them losing their jobs.  Just getting their money back won&#x27;t fix that.<p>Luckily the towing fees here in Ohio seem pretty cheap compared to the Bay Area.  I had my car towed once (illegally) and it came out to around $130.  But towing companies here aren&#x27;t required to accept credit cards or checks, so they don&#x27;t.  It is cash only and they don&#x27;t make change, which is especially aggravating given that the total always works out to some odd amount like $134.72.  That&#x27;s perhaps the sleaziest part of that sleazy business.<p>Fortunately a bill was recently passed aiming to reduce predatory towing practices. [2] Among the changes it&#x27;s going to bring is to provide a streamlined process to dispute towing charges; victims of illegal towing can collect double the towing fees.  Victims of towing will now also be able to retrieve items from there car without needing to pay a fee.  And the bill will now (at last) require that towing companies accept credit cards.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/04/10/two-towing-companies-fees-illegal-judge-rules.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/04/10/two...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/03/20/house-oks-bill-to-tighten-towing-rules.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/03/20/hou...</a>",1409287016

All the best on the platform for distribution.<p>Please don&#x27;t take the advice to downplay rspec.  I think in chapter 8 you update the User model.  It was so incredibly nice that, having been a week or so since I was able to work on the project, I was confident that the introduced changes did not break any functionality of the app.  It is very easy to not see the benefit of testing when learning, only to curse your luck when you look at code later.<p>I have recently read a good article using your test suite as an example of how to improve tests.  The author criticized the terse nature of your tests, with subject and nested describes.  He felt that you write once and read often, so there is great benefit to making the tests verbose.  It is, in effect, a contract that any User model must satisfy to be a valid user model.  Going DRY and code golf on it only helps to frustrate the person looking to acclimate themselves to a project rather than saving a few minutes during test creation.<p>Again all the best and thanks for the wonderful tutorial and interesting distribution network.",1409286976

Just like with regular non-free software, you have to trust what it is doing.<p>This is, sadly, not true at all. You have to trust<p>1) that the actual author of the site is playing fair<p>2) that you are not being mitm attacked by anyone in this list [1]. Note that 3 organisations on this list are known to have issued false certificates with the express purpose of stealing login credentials. They did this by sending through &quot;amended&quot; login javascript bundles.<p>> I agree that server-run non-free software is neither safe nor private, but I still believe that this is the flaw of particular programs, not web-based software in general. It only emphasizes what a need there is for further development of open standards in web apps.<p>No. Web apps can be replaced by malicious software every time you use it, and there is nothing you can do to prevent this. It is a fundamental design flaw of web based systems. And, of course, &quot;cert pinning&quot; simply means that a few organisations (google, facebook) get isolated from a few kinds of attacks.<p>The flaw is that control is placed entirely in the hands of the remote side. Needless to say, this is not secure.<p>I don&#x27;t get where this idea of open standards being the solution to privacy problems comes from. Cookies are an open standard, the web is an open standard, TPMs are an open standard, the SSL certiciate chain principle is an open standard. Hell, microsoft palladium is an open standard. All are complete disasters for privacy and freedom.<p>> But the ability to use a cross-platform browser as a universal client and run software that is built on the advantages of networking is a huge bonus for software in general. Free software just needs to catch up in a few areas, but in general it is dominating the backbone of the web. Now we just need to push that freedom forward to the user.<p>I disagree. The web has brought back the &quot;freedoms&quot; of the mainframe era, only with a much bigger dependency on the mainframe system. Mainframes also in many cases ran free software. Can you claim with a straight face that a non-root account on a mainframe system is in any way free and private ?<p>If you don&#x27;t decide what software runs on your machine, like on the web, you have ZERO security guarantees. Zero. Nothing, nada, zilch, ... no matter how secure anything built on top of that is.

Cars with double clutch transmissions do not have a &quot;neutral&quot; setting and cannot be easily towed (when you put a BMW DCT into neutral it becomes park, for example).<p>If towed in the wrong way, it can severely damage an expensive car, and considering Ferrari owners can also afford lawyers, it&#x27;s safer to tow the Civic, especially the towing fee is the same either way.",1409284994

Cars are expensive to own and operate (let alone deal with unforeseen expenses like these). In my city, our &quot;public transit&quot; is a joke that consists of buses that run every hour or so and stop running at 7:30pm—hey, at least they have free wifi?<p>After seeing Europe&#x27;s transit system first-hand all summer, it makes little sense to me why the investment has not been made in the USA—especially in larger metropolitan areas like SF.",1409284928

Protein fibers include animal fibers such as silk, spider silk, wool, alpaca, and many more.  Another approach to novel fiber qualities might arise through bioengineering and process improvements around cellulose fibers.  In fact, this is exactly what&#x27;s happened with rayon fibers.  Rayon is a now-broad category of cellulose based fibers.  Lyocell (branded Tencel) is one variant that was specifically designed to be pollution-free amongst other qualities, eliminating some serious environmental concerns with the chemical production process of early rayons.  Likewise, you&#x27;ll find &quot;bamboo&quot; yarn and fabric, which is a kind of rayon based on bamboo cellulose vs. the more usual wood chips.",1409284924

This is not a system that is well understood, and one that is difficult to model. This type of intervention might be successful, but you could also kill off large amounts of marine life, making a bad situation significantly worse. That doesn&#x27;t mean geoengineering shouldn&#x27;t be explored, but it&#x27;s potentially risky. A wrong move could lead to mass starvation of not only marine life, but the numerous human populations that depend on that marine life.",1409284894

The amounts charged are not in proportion to many people&#x27;s ability to pay. This imbalance doesn&#x27;t make society, which we all inhabit btw, any more stable or functional.<p>Of course, if fines were lowered self entitled assholes would do whatever they please and laugh off the fines. I think the solution is this... first offenses should be a very very small fine and the amounts should double on each subsequent offense. That should stop the self entitlement fairly quickly. Of course, this is assuming the intent is promote proper parking, not to strong-arm money out of people&#x27;s pockets in order to finance an army of bureaucrats and general wasteful spending. That is the intent...proper parking behavior, right?",1409284812

You have more domain knowledge about the objects you&#x27;re creating so you can special case and beat malloc()/free()(which can be extremely painful in some cases).<p>2. You need to control the <i>memory layout</i> of your objects so that the data access patters line up with memory layout. The speed improvements here are on the order of  50-100x depending on your case.<p>Usually(but not always) GC&#x27;d languages don&#x27;t give you value types that let you do #2. C# and a few others happen to be a nice exception.

        y if y < 0 => “negative”,

and wonders if there is some kind of &quot;algebraic data values&quot; to notice that the previous case is exaustive.<p>In Haskell they solve this particular problem with an &quot;Ordering&quot; ADT:<p><pre><code>    data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT

        LT -> &quot;Positive&quot;
        EQ -> &quot;Equal&quot;

Using a richer datatype instead of boolean predicates solves most problems. For some more advanced things you need extensions to the type systems.

9547387,comment,9546382,9547047,0,0,eridius,,,"More commentary:<p>> <i>Another feature where a pragma seems out of place is inlining, although in this case I can’t really blame Rust for it. [...] I’ve always thought it should be up to the caller to say which functions they’d like inlined, and the function should just mind its own business.</i><p>It should actually be up to the compiler to make that call. And for all functions <i>within a crate</i> it is up to the compiler. Every function (that&#x27;s not marked as `#[inline(never)]`) is a candidate for inlining anywhere else it&#x27;s called within the same crate. The #[inline] attribute is a hint to the compiler that it might want to inline it more often, but the compiler is free to decide not to inline it.<p>Where #[inline] really matters is when calling it from other crates. The compiler can only inline functions that it actually can see the definition of. This should be obvious from the fact that inlining requires the compiler to copy the definition to the point where it was called. So what the #[inline] attribute does, besides hint to the compiler that you might like to inline it, is include the AST for the function in the library. This is actually the same thing it already does for generic functions (since generic functions need to be instantiated by the caller for arbitrary type parameters). So a generic function doesn&#x27;t actually need #[inline] at all to be inlined. But non-generic functions do.<p>> <i>(but five function calls (from_ptr, from_utf8, to_bytes, unwrap, to_string) just to convert a C string to a Rust string seems like an excessive amount of ceremony</i><p>You&#x27;re right. The std::ffi module is relatively new. There used to be a simpler way to convert from a * const u8 into a &str but it appears to have fallen by the wayside.<p>> <i>Rust won’t read C header files</i><p>You should check out <a href=""https://github.com/crabtw/rust-bindgen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/crabtw/rust-bindgen</a>. It&#x27;s a tool that can generate the Rust extern interfaces from C headers.<p>> <i>A function that does something unsafe (e.g. pointer arithmetic or calling C libraries) can be exported as safe.</i><p>If this weren&#x27;t true than large swaths of the standard library would be unsafe, including anything that calls into libc or makes system calls.<p>When you expose a safe interface that uses `unsafe`, you&#x27;re promising that you will guarantee safety yourself in a way the compiler cannot verify. If you do not want to (or cannot) guarantee that your interface is safe, then you should mark it as `unsafe` and let the caller deal with it. But the ability to wrap `unsafe` code in safe interfaces is absolutely crucial for lots of things, including much of the standard library. The hope is that most people writing Rust code won&#x27;t ever have to use `unsafe` themselves because the standard library (or other people&#x27;s libraries) will provide the necessary safe interfaces. But people writing safe interfaces around unsafe constructs need the ability to do this.<p>> <i>but until a few days ago, Cargo didn’t understand linker flags</i><p>I believe this was already addressed in another comment, but this is not actually true. Cargo build scripts can provide flags to give to rustc, and `extern` declarations can be annotated with attributes specifying certain linker flags (such as the name of the library to link to).",1431635331

That used to plague me mentally far more than the idea of &quot;non-existence&quot; does. Hell is a rough concept that can keep one awake at night.

This shim receives a single event and then reconnects.

Hence, if something can work with spamassassin then it will be capable to talk with rspamd at some extent.<p>Multiple database drivers are in plans for rspamd 1.0 (along with personal statistics and advanced rules planner). The tricky stuff here is that rspamd uses non-blocking model currently which is hardly supported by database drivers (excluding redis and some others). However, rspamd has a concept of asynchronous threads executed in thread pool.

667059,comment,666809,666809,0,0,notirk,,,"I'm a contractor working on the new NYC 911 system and the supporting IT infrastructure. The current system, at the desktop level, is all old IBM AIX boxes and every single one has one of these keyboards. The monitors, mice, etc have all been replaced due to wear and tear, but these keyboards have put up with the abuse of 24/7 constant typing for the last 15-20 years. Pretty amazing. I wouldn't mind grabbing one or two once they cut over to the new system.",1245552900

As an outside spectator of the ""silicon valley hype machine,"" it seems that none of these sites really fit their mold. I.e, ""Changing the world in one fell swoop!"" Their mass impact is exponentially more subtle than Twitter, but still quite effective and important.<p>At the site I co-founded we are in a similar situation. We provide bank rates, reviews, news, etc. and we know that these are important issues to the average consumer. However, this doesn't necessarily translate into TechCrunch writing stories about us. We're just not that cool...<p>But, as we all know, you don't have to be cool or change the world to be profitable.",1245552387

What makes your metabolism tick?<p>What you're going to find is that excersizing, and eating a LOT of proteing (so that your body doesn't metabolize muscle tissue [like your heart] while you're on your uber low cal diet) are the best way to lose weight.<p>Don't eat anything (or very little) for like 2 days and the thought of eating a black and blue burger will start to seem repulsive.

667044,comment,666809,666809,0,0,msluyter,,,"No, this is not a great keyboard. Not even close. It's terribly unergonomic.  When I worked at IBM, I had this keyboard, and it seriously hurt my hands. I pulled off the keys and purposefully crimped the springs so that they'd be weaker and it would have a lighter action.<p>IMHO, most modern non-ergonomic (straight) keyboards are bad for you because they force wrist deviation (bending). That would include Apple's, and this is the one area where I really dislike Apple's design principles.",1245551028

No interpreted code may be downloaded and used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple's Published APIs and built-in interpreter(s).""<p>The key phrase here is ""other executable code""- i.e., code that isn't already in the application bundle. There's nothing wrong with running an emulator or interpreter. You just can't have it dynamically download new games or apps that weren't already bundled. It's understandable why Apple would have this restriction, or else there would be a lot of people trying to build their own app store within an app.<p>If the C64 app didn't allow new games to be d/l'ed then there's no reason for the rejection. Perhaps it wasn't clear to the reviewer (it certainly isn't to me, after reading that article) whether it allowed new games to be loaded or not.",1245550306

For my second pass I go back and look at the examples to see if they answer any of the questions I wrote down and write down more questions referencing the examples. For the first two passes I don't try to answer any questions. I simply try to engage the material. Finally I try to answer all the unanswered questions and work some of the exercises and write down more questions if there are any left.",1245550030

I jumped on it when I started having wrist pains and waking up with numb hands (first signs of carpal). Since using the keyboard, the pain and numbness has gone away.<p>I will point out that it took a good 2-3 weeks to get used to the layout, though now it feels quite natural.<p>For more info, I highly recommend the stack overflow thread on keyboards:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/687/keyboard-for-programmers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/687/keyboard-for-programm...</a>",1245549784

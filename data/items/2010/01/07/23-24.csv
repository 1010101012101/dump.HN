I think there's very little chance they will ever hold that type of dominant position in the SmartPhone market so whatever they choose to do with the iPhone & App Store doesn't really impede the consumer's ability to choose an open platform. I think choice is a good thing. If someone wants an open platform they can get it. If someone wants a nicely packaged, but extremely functional and trouble free, platform Apple will sell it to them.",1262908790

One (big name, big time) has rigorous build/commit processes, the other one (startup) uses ""checkstyle"" and ""findbugs"" but lacking of code-reviews process and best-practices/standards.<p>During my time in the first company, I thought there were too many bureaucracies/processes revolving code policies.I felt that those rules were slowing me down. After I spent time with the second company, I took my words back. We wasted time arguing about code-style and best practices/standards.

People have speculated about it being a MacBook replacement but there's a huge difference in the type of consumer buying a $350 net book and a $999+ MacBook. I think Apple has insulated their computer business from being cannibalized from lower end devices. Lots of people say ""if I already have an iPhone and a MacBook why would I want a tablet?"" and the answer probably is you don't. This product is not aimed at you. It's for the people who don't want a $999+ MacBook and are currently buying PC net books instead. As such I think the price will be <$499 (maybe a bit higher on launch just to cover supply & demand)",1262908509

I think it's a nicely succinct collection of relevant guidelines that, if used by a beginner, would yield a more aesthetic result than if they just winged it. I'd rather someone read Bringhurst (there's a cool version of the book applied to the web here: <a href=""http://webtypography.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webtypography.net</a>), but unless a person is serious about getting into design I doubt they'd spend the time.<p>I'll concede it's not the best - but most of it is decent advice. The only real exception I take is with his suggested practice of underlining text for emphasis; obviously that's a no-no, especially on the web.<p>Also, I think we can reduce the author's assertion that one should use Fibonacci numbers as a model for type size down to something more basic and useful: choosing to use a mathematical sequence to inform structural design decisions can assist one in creating work that has stronger internal relationships. If there's a rhythm and harmony to type size that is congruent with the spacing of the underlying grid, I think the work will tend to feel tighter and more elegant than if there's no underlying intelligence informing those decisions. Not to say that one can't shoot from the hip and win a few, or that a little chaos isn't beautiful - but using a regular system will tend to produce more regular results, particularly if it's one (like Fibonacci numbers) that are visible in the world around us and have been informing art for hundreds of years.<p>Common sense says that a culture's views on what is aesthetic and acceptable are largely informed by its environment and history. I don't think we necessarily need a study to tell us that the Fibonacci/golden ratio thing has a certain inherent beauty; the evidence is out there in all the art that's been produced using those numbers as a foundation.",1262906109

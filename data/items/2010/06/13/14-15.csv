If I need to analyze some data, say in a logfile, I'll often write a trivial bit of Python to load it into SQLite and do my work in SQL. For a few 10s of Gs of data, this works brilliantly. I'd go so far as to say it's the least-buggy program I use day to day, and that includes the OSs I run it on and ""real"" commercial databases.",1276441114

Selection pressure doesn't operate on species, populations, organisms, or even cells. It operates on genes. What appears to be organism selection is actually gene selection operating in the special circumstance that all of your cells were created by the same genome. This is also why bees, which will gladly commit suicide to sting you and protect the hive, aren't an example of group selection. The bees that sting you are sterile. The reproductive potential of their genes lies entirely outside of their bodies, so they're disposable.

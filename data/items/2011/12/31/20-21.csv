I used to cycle everywhere in my small town, and take buses after that. For a year, I used to commute by train to college; a distance of about 54 miles took about 1 hour total.<p>Now that I can drive, I still have no interest in a car. Mind you, I live in London, where driving a car is very expensive; just congestion charges and parking alone would make it more expensive than public transport, never mind fuel costs, insurance and depreciation.<p>But scooters in the city: that's another game altogether, almost literally. In the UK, filtering / lane splitting is legal, and nowhere is it as gleefully taken advantage of as in London. Getting from A to B is such a joy I frequently go out into the evening rush hour (I work from home) merely to entertain myself, cutting through the traffic.<p>Two wheels: no congestion charge, much better fuel consumption, significantly cheaper insurance, parking is cheap or usually free outside of Westminster,  and the weather is almost always mild. It's very hard to beat. And overall, the cost is less than public transportation if you're not living in central London (where you'll take the hit in rent prices or living circumstances instead).",1325365194

3411824,comment,3410773,3410773,0,0,rglover,,,"I'm glad to see this being discussed. As a designer/front-end dev, I find working remotely to be personally rewarding and immensely productive. Going to an office all day is not fun and with all of the distractions, it makes work even more difficult. Being remote removes these barriers. This is great because when you need to get a project done, you can have hours of uninterrupted time and knock stuff out.<p>There is one major caveat, though, in that IT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE. Whether it be that you thrive in a communal environment, work better in teams, or just can't get your work done without being babysat, some people just don't cut it.<p>For companies, it's an excellent way to diversify your team and build an international presence.<p>It's 2012.

3411815,comment,3409171,3411703,0,0,MatthewCampbell,,,"There are cases where covariant return types are abused, so it's fine that you treat it as a code smell. However, C++ does make them necessary for several valid patterns. This does include alexgartrell's example, but here's a popular one:<p>I have a polymorphic type that should be copyable. Because of the limitations of C++ copy constructors and operators, my only option is to expose a virtual method (call it ""copy""). The non-smelly semantics we want are such that if you call ""copy"" on an object, you get an identical copy of the same type. So if you call ""copy"" on a pointer of type A, you get an A. Call it on a B, you get a B.<p>The contract itself is polymorphic. It doesn't commit to returning any particular flavor of A.<p>We can implement this method if we return naked pointers. But if we want to be safe and return a smart pointer, we have to introduce dynamic casting or other worse smells.",1325364773

Every shoe can get photographed exactly the same way, doesn't need to demonstrate fit, doesn't need to communicate a larger style vision. I think they do all their photography when the product enters the warehouse, and the photos don't get much of a touch-up.<p>-- Macy's, on the other hand, has a creative vision of the various customers and lifestyles we're selling to, and the photos generally have to communicate that. That means: model selection, pairing with pants/shirts, posing, etc. Same with home products like bedding or towels. It's a fine line to walk between making sure to show all the product's features and attributes such as fit, fabric, pattern/embellishment, etc, and communicating the aspirational style vision-- who the customer wants to be when they buy that shirt. It's a tradeoff.<p>-- Photography is expensive. It takes a lot of people and stuff to create a good fashion photo: model, photographer, hair, makeup, wardrobe stylist, art director, digital capture tech, retoucher, studio, lights, cameras, computers, catering, .. the list goes on. We're ruthless negotiators on this stuff and really efficient, but on a per-product basis it ain't cheap.<p>-- Macy's fashion is highly seasonal so we might not buy as deep into a given style since it's only good for 6 months or less, so that cost is amortized over a fewer number of sales.<p>All that said, we're working on it for sure.

Our American society lacks the idea of planning for the future since post WWII, and only focuses on the 'now'. Where are the great cities in America?

One is returning a pointer to A, and the other is returning a pointer to B (which just happens to be a subclass of A).  It matters, and just because you <i>can</i> do it with a naked pointer doesn't mean that you <i>should</i>.  The problem you've described is a code smell.<p>If I hand you a pointer to B, you (client code) can do everything that is exposed by B.  If I hand you a pointer to A, you can only do the set of things exposed by A.  And that's a fundamentally different interface guarantee.",1325362168

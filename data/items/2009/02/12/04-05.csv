In a standard business reorganization all contracts are capable of being modified by the judge or by consensus of the creditors.  There's really no good reason for homes to be an exception and it's one of the more direct ways to keep people in homes.  Frankly, this is probably better for all of us considering the massive overallocation of resources to housing investment and the current existence of too much housing stock.  Either we help people stay in them and they cover a percent of the mortgage or we kick them out and sell the house to... oh wait.  Yeah.  I'm more scared of the knockon effects of allowing a massive devaluation in housing than the potential knockon effects of judges modifying mortgages in bankruptcy just like they modify all other obligations in bankruptcy.<p>Further, Phil was talking to people with $2 TRILLION to invest?

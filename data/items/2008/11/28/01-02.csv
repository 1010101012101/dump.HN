379038,comment,378582,378898,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"The ""Organic"" in Organic food refers to the method of farming rather than the food itself, and thus is entirely valid.<p>I think the chemists have a point, but at the same time trying to be over-protective of language is often an exercise in futility.<p>There have been plenty of articles about an older generation complaining about the appropriate of the word ""gay"". For younger generations it's not something we have a problem with.<p>I would suggest that for chemists they might consider that the common usage of ""chemical"" is actually an abbreviation of ""manufactured chemical"" or some similarly accurate term.<p>Many parts of science are constantly misrepresented by those not involved in the specific subject area.

379023,comment,378167,378468,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"Use of the term ""the singularity"", particularly your use here sets my teeth on edge. It's not about technology, it is about our models.<p>The North Pole is a singularity - coordinates converge there to become a single point (singular). They only do this because we chose a coordinate system that makes this happen. It is silly to talk about how you coils go there and then not be able to go any further north, as if that means it is the edge of the world.<p>Likewise ""the singularity"" is not a magical threshold of AI and immortality or transhumanism, it's where a given model of the future predicts nonsense because you have pushed it too far. Pick a different predictive model, get different results.<p>To claim, then, that the singularity may never happen is to claim either that change with feedback will stop, or a perfect model.<p>Better to claim that AI or genetically enhanced people, or neural prostheses, or smart matter, or superconductivity, or antigerones, or quantum computing, or virtual reality or whatever game changing technology won't happen - if that's what you mean.<p>(I for one think good PDA keyboards will never happen. :( hurry up Gunilla Alsio and senseboard, and that new t9 thing)",1227834666

As fate would have it, one of the founders (Srini) was actually living in the building next to us and we started having informal hacking lessons where heÂd teach us how to hack... Once the three months were up he rejoined the YouOs guys to work on their new product, Project Wedding.""<p>The synergies and group dynamics provided by Ycombinator is amazing.

13374,comment,13312,13367,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Search is a business with notoriously <i>small</i> lock-in and network effects.  Eric Schmidt comments on this all the time, it's a significant risk factor for Google.<p>Brand loyalty is a cumulative advantage, but it's pretty fickle.  Customers will stick with a trusted brand as long as they continue to trust it, but all it takes is one or two screwups or a competitor coming out with a noticeably better product, and your brand evaporates.<p>I first used Google in 1999, and it was <i>much</i> better than the existing search engines.  Not a little better, not even just noticeably better, but orders of magnitude better.  I could immediately find results that I'd previously have to dig through 10 pages of links for.<p>They may not have that advantage now, but I don't care.  Google is good enough.  Until someone comes out with a search engine that's <i>noticeably</i> better, I'm not going to switch.  I've already got my Firefox toolbar setup, and my habits - I see no reason to reevaluate them until there's clear evidence that I can do better.<p>Google almost pulled off the same thing with GMail, but Yahoo and Microsoft stopped them.  When GMail came out, it was orders of magnitude better than the existing webmail solutions.  It gave you 1GB of space instead of 4MB, it had Google search integrated, and it had a clean AJAX UI.  Like many early adopters, I switched as soon as I could get my hands on an invite (you only got 1 or 2 back then), and have since made GMail my default e-mail client.  But it didn't completely penetrate the mass market, because Y!Mail and Hotmail immediately upped their storage space to 400+ MB, and Yahoo came out with a new UI.  IMHO, GMail is still better, but it's no longer an <i>order of magnitude</i> better, so people who are just getting GMail invites now often choose to stick with their existing e-mail.",1176753604

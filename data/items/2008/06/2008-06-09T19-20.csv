I'm sure that the best way to do things the Silicon Valley's way is moving there, but where's the innovation apart from the product ?<p>But I have a Silicon Valley tale : Steve Jobs, if he distorts reality and makes his twisted ideas of reality become the real reality, it's not by conforming to established things. He creates his battleground, convoke his enemies on it and then fight. 
There's some ""second order"" risk to take : not only you risk to fail in your venture, but you can take a higher risk by failing in the way you start your venture.

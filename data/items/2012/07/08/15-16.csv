What I said.<p>I think we should just agree to disagree on both, because we are not getting anywhere.<p>EDIT: I just want to add that IMO - you can call something 'good' without comparing it to something else.

Sometimes you have good people who just don't work well together, or who could be assets to the company but aren't communicating well. These things become common at scale. I actually find ""performance"" rhetoric to be insulting and imbecilic, so I think it's better to discuss <i>impact</i>... but if you have 100 good people, at least a couple are going to fall below an acceptable level of impact, even if they're capable people working hard and in good faith.<p>This is one of the problems with typical HR mediation practices. In most companies, HR is worthless. That comes from the implicit assumption that one party or the other is ""bad people"" and that they have to assign fault: if an employee gets a bad review, for example, they have to conclude either (a) that the manager gave an unfair review, making him look bad at this job, or (b) that the employee actually sucks. There's no alternative. This rarely works well, because unless there is a legal reason (e.g. a sexual harassment complication) that impels them to side with the employee, they'll side with the manager every time.<p>This is one of the biggest problems with performance reviews. They force the manager to take a definitive stance on each employee, and because to disagree with a review is openly to call that manager incompetent, people are afraid to do so even when, by rights, they should.",1341762388

However, the OP and most of the other foreigners who visit India, visit places or deal with people that are known to be hostile.<p>I, as an Indian, will be utterly shocked if I visit a ghetto in downtown Detroit. Heck, there are more chances of getting mugged or shot in such ghetto. However, I will not visit such places as they are known to be hostile.<p>India is a weird place and to survive you need to live as Indians live. Some insights -<p>a) Yes, we have highest number of beggars. But most of them are cheats. Most of them will walk away if you offer them a job instead of money or food. Also, a lot of them work for beggar mafias.<p>b) They say that all of those 33 crore Hindu Gods, Buddha and Allah have left India ages ago. Religions are more customary than spiritual and Indians follow 'em just for the sake of customs. It's a common sight to see a young guy driving by a temple reciting a few shlokas while driving and offer a customary mini version of prayer.<p>People who come to India on a spiritual tour make me laugh. If you think that you can attain enlightenment or get more spiritual by travelling thousands of miles and spending a couple of weeks at a 500$/night resort near Haridwar, then you need some serious help.<p>c) Tourists buy ""Indian"" stuff that no Indian buys. The clutches or carpets or the wooden elephants are made specially for foreign tourists and are freakingly overpriced. The best way to buy Indian stuff, would be to go to regular markets with a local friend.<p>d) Garbage is a big problem. Its in our nature to litter. Take an Indian to US or Australia and he will not spit or litter. While the same person might even pee on a street back in India. The only option is to live/stay in relatively cleaner localities.<p>e) Drivers, hotel staff, guides, store keepers and public servants are dishonest because they are virtually unaccountable to anyone and the legal system ain't efficient enough to nab the dishonest. A ""x"" star restaurant can continue to function despite serving cockroaches or hair strands in their dishes. Apparently, identifying the trait of dishonesty is easier if you know the local lingo/culture.<p>People know a lot of about American culture because of Hollywood and American sitcoms. I am not an expert in American culture, but I can identify whether a person is playing me. I can not do that in any other country (say Italy).<p>Same logic applies to foreigners who visit India.

Proving completeness in the syntactic framework becomes a matter of showing that any combinatory rewriting rule can be expressed in terms of your base combinators. This in turn can be done if your combinators allow arbitrary permutations to be expressed in addition to duplication and dropping of symbols (cf. lengthening and shortening rules in GEB). For example, K is a dropping combinator, and rather than viewing S as a substitution operator on the semantic level (as is done when translating lambda calculus to SK calculus), it can be viewed as a hybrid permutation and duplication combinator at the syntactic level. If these dual roles are split into separate combinators, you get alternative axiom systems.",1341761993

Some people are just slimy; they will be slimy no matter what industry they are in.<p>I think this is a bit defeatist. Professions can and do regulate their own culture. It's a question of having the will to do so. I'm going through the process of being admitted to the bar right now, and I have to say it's instilled in me at least a healthy fear. It's incredibly invasive. The character & fitness committee not only digs into your public data (speeding tickets, etc), but reaches back into things like expunged juvenile convictions. And it starts from Day 1. I had professors who were on the C&F committee who told me horror stories of people with $200k of debt failing to be admitted. There is a honor code culture. If there was cheating going on at my law school, it was below my radar, while it was fairly common at my engineering school.<p>I feel medicine is the same way. I have family members who are surgeons who feel incredibly uncomfortable just when drug reps bring in lunch. Even in engineering, at least in the traditional disciplines like mechanicals, etc, (I was an aerospace major), there is a strong understanding that when you go into work, peoples' lives are on the line.<p>I'm sure there are a lot of slimly people in these professions, but the difference is that the strong cultural condemnation forces such behavior under the radar.

While I agree with aspects of poor governance and garbage accumulation and many other observations, I realized the author was out to represent a preconceived notion of a nation, when I read, ""homeless people sleeping on the tarmac, the city is so crowded and disgusting that people decide theyd rather sleep on the airport runway.""<p>I will pick on that lie to state my point. If you have been to any of the smaller metros in India, you generally get thru immigration at Mumbai before taking a flight from the domestic terminal. Getting to the domestic terminal from the international terminal is cumbersome. You are escorted in a bus operated by the Airport Authority of India, accompanied by security personel.<p>The aspect of the ride that is of interest is the route taken by the bus. The bus operated within the premises of the airport often running along side the tarmac and taxi way thru numerous and repeated security check-points while it meanders to or from the domestic terminal. This gives you the best view of the runways at ground level in slow speed often around 15 kmph and includes a section of the ride around the cargo terminals.<p>Most international airlines operate to and out of Mumbai during the night often after 12 AM. I have taken this ride on at least 3 occasions and have not seen a single individual sleeping on the tarmac on even one occasion.<p>What the author might be referring to could be the people you find in a semi sleep state around the terminal, more so near the cargo terminals. These are employees in the cargo section often on a break. The employees are usually uniformed and any one can observe the security batches hanging around their necks.<p>You would then have to assume that the intent of the author is intentional mis-representation and sensationalism.

In the US the infrastructure is a requirement for even moderate population growth.<p>The same applies to shelter.  In India, a hut made of newspaper is adequate shelter year round.  Try that in the Northern US and you'll freeze.<p>The result of this is that there are more poor people who do not rely as much on large scale planning and infrastructure for their basic survival.<p>Yes India's government is corrupt, but not all that much more corrupt than the US government.<p>If you want to talk about rights for the poor, in India if someone isn't using land and you set up a tent on it and start living there, you can't be evicted.  The shantytowns that the author found so disturbing are actually a side-effect of India's weak property rights laws, which themselves are a result of democratic pressure from the poor to continue living where their families have lived for generations.  Contrast this to the genocide the US conducted against native Americans who were in the way.<p>Basic infrastructure (roads, sewers) is lacking in India, but those are not easy projects to bootstrap.  Bangalore has a massive sewer construction project going on now.<p>Frankly, it's not all that bad.  Sure the garbage smells bad, but it's mostly just a matter of learning not to keep inhaling after you catch a whiff of something rank on the breeze.<p>If you are concerned about India's political infrastructure, notice that India's rulers are forming alliances with the US to help thwart Pakistan's nuclear ambitions.  Note that once the US has a stake in one ruling party it tends to do much to prop up and empower that party, even if there are horrible human rights consequences.<p>When I go to India I notice the energy.  People sit happily beneath a dirty tarp in a roadside food stand, enjoying Manchurian Gobi... sometimes 4 or 5 people sharing one bowl of the delicious spicy food.  Smiles everywhere.  These are extremely poor people.  Also I notice the tiny businesses, some retail locations are only a few square feet in size but sell a variety of goods and are staffed by a single motivated shopkeeper who works 18+ hour days.<p>India is full of hard working people and ingenuity.   I found the author's generalizations about dishonesty, etc., quite offensive.<p>Consider how much effort is undertaken in the US to hide poverty from view.  Sadly the US ends up putting a very large percentage of its poor population in prisons and has relocated many to horrific housing projects, where the violence and horrors are contained away from view.<p>Consider how much effort is undertaken in the US to present the appearance of legit, non-corrupt institutions.

They all want to know how to 'look for a job' online. Show 'em how to use the mouse, what icons represent the internet, how to get email, and see they're having trouble. Slowly begin to understand they're only memorizing shapes and patterns of letters, and don't really know how to read or write.<p>We're all so hyper literate, I can say that about everyone here.

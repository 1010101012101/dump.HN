All of this is incredibly fast and ergonomic as opposed to move your right hand to the arrow keys every now and then. ""<p>This explains it so perfectly.  The arrow keys are not a penalty.  They are 1. clearly labeled, and 2. available on every keyboard.  Using them is intuitive.  They require no knowledge or memorization.<p>Yes, I have to move my right hand to them, just as I have to occasionally move my right hand to the mouse and/or trackpad.  I am not performing data entry. I am editing a file, often a configuration file of some sort.  Speed is not the issue; accuracy of the changes being made are.  Even when I'm coding in an IDE, I'm not touch-typing like a 1960s typist. I spend more time thinking/contemplating than typing.<p>It's not a vi/vim thing. Emacs was just as confusing to me. I'm not proposing or suggesting anything so much as observing how a new, less effective technique of consuming HN was given praise ""just because it's done in Terminal"". There is a perverse hatred of the GUI or even things considered intuitive in the linux world, which I understand are inherited from the unix world, which is very, very old.<p>I just don't understand why we can't pay homage to that legacy, but still advance the needle.

It's not that difficult to implement and all the tricky conditions still have to be checked by people - for example my auto-parking car will completely ignore people in its way, anything on the street, will abort if it's on a slope down, will not check for lots of issues that you're supposed to correct manually.<p>Collision avoidance is for now a simple break when some object is getting close fast.

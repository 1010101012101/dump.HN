10562360,comment,10554657,10561394,0,0,moonchrome,,,"One thing that seems strange to me as an outsider is how all your tech startups and companies are clustering in areas with very high cost of living. I don&#x27;t know much about the US since I&#x27;m European but I do keep track of stuff around here on HN.<p>I can understand it from employee point of view - large city - big job market and naturally those places are also more desirable. But if you&#x27;re going down the startup route you&#x27;re already going to sacrifice things for a potentially big payout down the road (assuming you have stocks - right ?) which is why I would have no problem relocating to a cheaper/less desirable area in order to lower the operational costs and increase the chance of success.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m thinking about it wrong but unless you are doing B2B or direct sales location shouldn&#x27;t matter more than having funds to stay operational/becoming profitable ?<p>One explanation I can come up with is that if you are looking for investors instead of profitability it makes sense to be closer to them - but at the same time that kind of feels like perverting incentives.<p>I was under the impression that the costs differences can be huge (2x) between regions - maybe that&#x27;s not the case ?",1447448311

10562314,comment,10559776,10559776,0,0,hibikir,,,"Scala is my favorite language. I use it every day. And yet, the language, and its ecosystem, have big problems nobody wants to tackle. They have nothing to do with the myths people talk about though.<p>For me, the biggest problem is how fractured the community is. Scala is not a very opinionated language at all, so work from different subcultures barely looks like the same language. Working with scalaz? You won&#x27;t touch the standard library at all. Finagle? Twitter came up with a Futures library before it came standard with Scala, and there seems to be no interest in migrating out of that, so you have multiple libraries for basic concurrency (along with the scalaz version of course). Those groups, that use the language so differently, do not share many interests when it comes to the evolution of the language, what parts are good and bad. This leads to much infighting, and an environment where instead of learning Scala, what people learn is that the community is divided, and often very rude. It makes learning a challenge. Each community also has a different idea of what it is considered acceptable behavior to other human beings. The scala mailing lists has postings that make your average Linus Tovalds post seem sensible and polite.<p>Another part that makes learning a challenge is how different application level Scala and library level Scala are. In a language like Java, it&#x27;s easy to go into the standard library, or into whatever popular library you want to use, and look under the covers, even and a newbie, and learn how to write idiomatic Java (whether that&#x27;s good or not). In Scala, the standard library, and pretty much every major library out there, use language features that are not needed at all for regular use, but are very valuable for building libraries, and yet make the code very hard to understand for someone new. For the worst case of all, look at the source code of Shapeless: Even very seasoned Scala programmers find it difficult to understand, because it&#x27;s attempting to do things that the designers never even expected people to do with the language.<p>Another problem, related to the previous one, is that since it&#x27;s so easy to build DSLs in Scala, pretty much every major library does it. Internal DSLs, implemented around a bunch of implicit conversions that you need to understand pretty well to solve syntax errors. For instance, say you want to use json in your spray web service. There are two ways to do it: Follow a tutorial without understanding it and hope you do not have errors, or spend the time to understand the type class pattern.<p>And that leads to the last, problem: There are basic intro articles out there. There&#x27;s information for experts. But the route from basic knowledge to mastery is a big cliff with very little information, and it&#x27;s easy for people to give up. As it is now, Scala is a language better learned tribally: You have a few gurus, and when complicated questions happen, go ask one of the gurus to see if he can teach you about whatever problem you are having, or about how a feature really applies to your problem.<p>I love Scala, I really do, but if the community problems are not resolved, the rest of the problems will not get resolved. It will remain a hard language to learn, and other languages that right now do not offer all the rich features of Scala will just steal what they can and replace it instead, just because they have better, less fractured communities.",1447447744

That&#x27;s why everyone is having such a fun time speculating when it will raise the FFR, thereby raising short-term interest rates for the entire economy.<p>In a traditional economic model, raising the short-term interest rate deters spending in the real economy and encourages saving as it allows a return on low-risk activities - savings accounts and bonds.<p>Clearly, having the interest rate at 0% has not spurred spending/consumption as the Fed had hoped post 2007. So they embarked on QE to push money into banks with the hope that these institutional gatekeepers would find good things to do with the trillions of newly minted dollars. Now banks are sitting on lots of money and have inflated the stock market and have most likely made an outsized number of dumb bets in the emerging country debt market, as well as the Chinese real estate market.<p>In my opinion it makes no sense for the Fed to either raise or lower the interest rates. While this would spur the banks into action (lowering would make them take riskier bets, raising would allow them to put more into bonds) it would not fix the underlying deficit of aggregate demand. The Fed keeps pushing on the supply side. We need the government to push tax dollars efficiently into sectors that will spur aggregate demand. R&D, infrastructure, education, and war are all examples of long-term investments that will grow demand over decades rather than a few years before another bubble (as we&#x27;re finding out now).<p>I doubt we&#x27;ll see either hyperinflation or hyperdeflation because the supply of money in the real economy is efficiently limited by the banks. Unless the Fed was to conduct a helicopter drop and start a round of QE that fed directly to the consumers, we won&#x27;t see a meaningful change in the currency in circulation, which is what causes hyperinflation/deflation.",1447447303

The release of Clair proves this will continue without me.<p>While much of my work at CoreOS was seen through the eyes of people attending conferences and readers of my blog entires, my true contribution was helping grow a community around containers, and more importantly exposing the benefits of distributed computing to a much larger audience.<p>Based on feedback, I consider my community efforts largely successful for many reasons including the following:<p>* I&#x27;ve been willing to help anyone learn this stuff by doing 1:1 hangouts, engaging in social media, or writing a book on Kubernetes. Whatever it takes.<p>* Building and sharing open source projects like confd[1], and my collection of prototypes such as motorboat[2], or exploring new integrations between tools like Docker Compose and Kubernetes[3].<p>I also spent a fair amount of time hacking on open source projects at CoreOS including rkt, etcd, and working with the community to ensure they could adopt our technologies, then incorporating feedback from users when we (CoreOS) made it hard too. As a result I gained Product Management responsibilities to go along with my advocacy work.<p>During my time at CoreOS Kubernetes came out, which represented a turning point for what I consider the majority of the industry (well the part that cares about application containers). Kubernetes represented many of the ideas we had been working towards at CoreOS, and in many ways was the perfect addition to the CoreOS stack.<p>I was an early code contributor of Kubernetes, which resulted in gaining commit access. But once the number of outside contributors grew, I felt I would have a larger impact building tools to fill in the gaps between Kubernetes and people adopting the platform. One of those tools being kube-register[4], which made it easy for people to automate the scaling out of a Kubernetes cluster using fleet.<p>Overtime I started to shift focus towards education, because what use is a platform for next generation infrastructure if no one knew how to use it? So came the workshops, book, and more conference talks.<p>In many ways I&#x27;m doing the exact same things -- working to improve the future of computing based on containers and core concepts of distributed computing, but at a different company, Google, which has many of the same core values regarding open source, community, and vision.<p>What happens to CoreOS?<p>I expect CoreOS to keep shipping stuff based on the same core values that attracted me there in the first place, and regardless of who provides my paycheck I&#x27;ll always be a member of the CoreOS family.

Values within this range but outside the range of precise integers are rounded to a multiple of 2.<p>Similarly in the range -67,108,864 to 67,108,864, all integers which are a multiple of 4 are represented precisely.<p>Basically, as you go outside the range of precise integers, values get rounded to a multiple of 2, 4, 8, etc. as required.<p>When the mantissa overflows the available precision, it is shifted to the right enough so that it fits without losing the most significant bits. Instead, the least significant bits are discarded, and the exponent is incremented by the number of discarded bits.<p>Of course you could choose other values where the rounding doesn&#x27;t work out in your favor, and then you&#x27;d get the unequal comparison you expect. A simple example:<p>33333333.0f + 1.0f != 33333334.0f<p>Here, the value 33,333,333 is rounded down to 33,333,332. Add 1 to that and you get 33,333,333, which is again rounded down to 33,333,332.<p>33,333,334 <i>is</i> represented precisely, so the comparison fails.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format#Precision_limitations_on_integer_values"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-poin...</a>",1447447075

Ship one package, view everywhere. And the plugins can be made for that medium safely from scratch.

I don&#x27;t see why we should be upset that the government took civil action without filing criminal charges; the civil burden of proof is lower than the criminal burden of proof because things like imprisonment, execution, loss of voting rights, etc., aren&#x27;t on the table with similar actions; consequently, the level of evidence with which it makes sense to initiate criminal process is different than that for which it makes sense to initiate civil process.<p>> The problem is that legal standard is that the government merely has to establish &quot;reasonable suspicion that there was a crime&quot;, while the person has to establish &quot;a preponderance of evidence that there was not&quot;.<p>The <i>initial seizure</i> proceeds based on reasonable suspicion, but the goverinnment has the burden of proof to show, by preponderance of the evidence, that the seized property is subject to forfeiture under the law.<p>(The owner may have the burden of proof for defenses that apply to prevent forfeiture of property that is otherwise subject to forfeiture, such as the &quot;innocent owner&quot; defense, where the property was subject to forfeiture because of its relation to a prohibited act, but the owner was uninvolved in the act.)<p>> A quick summary is that a couple was indicted of a crime and successfully defended themselves. In the process the government seized a home through civil forfeiture, and the forfeiture stood because the couple was unable to prove the crime did not happen.<p>Er, no. What that source reports on is not that at all. It reports on the couple being indicted of a crime, and, as a consequence of the indictment, property that would (according to the government) be forfeitable under <i>criminal</i> forfeiture (which has the criminal burden of proof) being seized so that it would be preserved. The couple, arguing that the seizure order was overly broad, sought a hearing on whether the seizure was in error, arguing that the broad seizure impaired their right to counsel of their choosing for the criminal trial; this is what the Supreme Court turned down.<p>This isn&#x27;t a case about civil forfeiture (the original seizure was to protect civil forfeiture, but the appeal was about the broader seizure under the superceding indictment which was to protect assets targeted for criminal forfeiture), it doesn&#x27;t address a target acquitted of a crime and where forfeiture still occurred (this does happen in civil forfeiture, but this isn&#x27;t an example), and it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the owner not being able to prove a crime didn&#x27;t happen.",1447445487

10562088,comment,10559724,10560233,0,0,graycat,,,"> They&#x27;re essentially saying that no one has a legitimate cause to hold thousands of dollars in cash, so they must be doing something illicit, so we have cause to take it.<p>IANAL, but I&#x27;d suspect that\nthe usual logic goes:  Usually\na person carrying a large\namount of cash is a criminal\nwho got the cash illegally.\nSo, anyone with a large amount\nof cash is likely a criminal,\nand we will treat them as such.<p>The gap here is that the person\nso treated need not have done\nanything wrong and are being\nprosecuted due to the crimes\nof others.<p>I doubt that there is a law\nsaying that having $20,000\nin cash is illegal.<p>So, \nif are going to\nprosecute Joe, then need to\ndo so from something Joe did,\nand prove he did it.  That\nmost people with a lot of\ncash got the cash illegally\ndoesn&#x27;t mean that Joe\ndid anything illegal, and\nthere&#x27;s no law against\nhaving a lot of cash.<p>I&#x27;ve learned my lesson:  Often\nthe police are enforcing \n<i>social norms and attitudes</i>\ninstead of laws and are enforcing\nthese against people who\nare not in the center of the\n<i>respectable</i> middle class.<p>E.g., since I&#x27;m doing a startup,\nI&#x27;m keeping down spending and\ndriving an old car.  Since the\ncar still, with a lot of maintenance, is fine, I can\nkeep driving it.<p>But recently I had occasion to\ngo to a poor, largely Black,\nsection of town.  On the\nway out of that section,\nI was followed closely by\na police car.  I just \ndrove in a very legal and\nnormal way, and, by the time\nI was out of that section of\ntown, the police car quit\nfollowing me.  But, I learned\nmy lesson:  At least with\nan old car, stay the heck out\nof a poor, Black area of town --\nthat&#x27;s the <i>real law</i>.<p>More of the <i>real law</i>\nis to participate in \nchurch, JAYCEES, Lions,\nschool board, be well known\nand liked,\nmake contributions to\npolitical campaigns,\ncontribute to the Fraternal\nOrder of Police and any\npolice charity drives,\nhave some associated \ndecals on the windows of\nmy car,\ndrive a late model, family\ncar, dress well, no beard,\nhair short, be known to the\nlocal\n<i>political power structure</i>,\netc.  Be known to the police\nin my neighborhood.  Ah, they didn&#x27;t tell me such things\nin civics class.<p>For more, get rich and be\na very anonymous donor to\nsome legal efforts to \nmount well funded challenges\nto such highway robbery in\nthe courts.<p>AFAIK, that&#x27;s just basically\nhow things work in the US.\nIn some other countries,\nthe citizen either (A) is too\npoor to have anything \nanyone would want to steal\nor (B) has some money and\nkeeps paying off the political\npower guys.<p>Apparently that we could \nactually follow the Constitution\nseems to be mostly a long\nshot.<p>In the meanwhile, the power \nstructure wants (A) bend the\nConstitution and slap down\nthe drug dealers, and likely\nanyone else they don&#x27;t like, \nso that\nwhen anyone looks at all\nsuspicious just steal any of\ntheir valuables and (B) \nput up with excesses by the\npolice, especially since the\nexcesses are mostly toward\npoor people.<p>So, the <i>real law</i>\nis, for any poor and/or Black stopped by\nthe police, look like the \nold movie character stepin\nfetchit, be passive,\nsubmissive, subordinate,\nsubservient, obsequious,\nact like a harmless child,\nhang head, don&#x27;t make eye\ncontact, keep hands in plain\nview, make only slow motions,\nand let the egotistical, bully thugs, with their dark, aviator sun glasses, SS like\nuniforms with lots of\nshiny metal attachements, get their jollies and let \nthe power structure be\nhappy with an <i>orderly rhythm</i>\nto the community.<p>Otherwise\nthe police have wide latitude\nto <i>enforce the laws</i>, act\nas prosecutor, judge, and jury,\nproscribe and execute sentences,\nall on the street, based just on\nanything, no charges, no due\nprocess, nothing.  So, all with\nno due process at all, the police\ncan embarrass, insult, humiliate\ninnocent citizens, steal their\nvaluables, insert things into\ntheir rectums and/or vaginas, \nbeat them with clubs,\nshock them electrically,\nand, for any reason or no real\nreason, just shoot and kill them.<p>The power structure and the\npolice can expect that some\ncitizens will object.<p>Our Founding Fathers \nunderstood kings, dictators,\nsecret police, bullies, thugs,\netc. and gave us a good\nConstitution.  We need to\nstop making incredibly\ncontrived, complicated\nrationalizations why \nthe very clear words in the\nConstitution don&#x27;t mean\nwhat they very clearly do say.<p>Of course, the solution is\ndemocracy:  When enough citizens\nget angry enough, there will\nbe changes.<p>Another solution is a lot\nmore video from smartphones,\ndash cams, etc.<p>And, just now, that the\nmainstream media (MSM)\nlikes ad revenue from\neyeballs and stories about\nscandal so much, the recent\nexamples and video of police killing\nunarmed citizens has gotten\na lot of attention.  \nNow in courts, commonly\na community with some police\nwho went way too far\ngets slapped with a judgment\nof several million dollars.<p>So, any layer of government with\na police force will need\nan insurance policy, and the\nrates will tend to show the\nrisks.  A police chief whose\nforce causes such a several \nmillion dollar judgment will\nget to look for a new job\nfar from police work.  Or,\nmoney talks, and it will\nbe talking loud and clear\nsoon.  And along the way,\nthe increased attention \nmay also stop the highway\nrobbery.",1447445121

(Of special import to me after all my zoology classes seemed to dwell on that difference to excess).<p>I think too few past investigations of cognition, especially AI-motivated and abstract / computational models of cognition, have approached the topic from assessment of human higher cognitive functions like creativity, invention, and genius.  It seems there&#x27;d be a lot of value toward understanding the mechanisms of cognition by recognizing patterns of extraordinary performance and then decomposing them to consistuents (as neurologists do clinically), rather than starting with the constituents and trying to compose them into higher models of cognition (as biologists or AI folks do, systematically or synthetically, respectively).<p>IMHO, AI approaches to cognitive synthesis have been largely a no-go.  Perhaps more dissection of high-level cognition could help?<p>I do know some folks have pursued research agendas somewhat like this -- cognitive scientists like Doug Hofstadter, or cognitive psychologists like John Anderson (ACT-R) and AI engineers like John Laird (Soar) or cognitive modellers like Thad Polk.<p>But has anyone seen continuing progress toward more than building bottom-up synthetic models that demonstrate an occasional human-like cognitive pattern, or bottom-up observational psych/neuro research papers on phenomenology, using this focus?

But they&#x27;d still do it, just because it&#x27;s part of their &quot;budget&quot;. Even if it doesn&#x27;t work, no one is really that accountable. They&#x27;re doing what they&#x27;re told and in reality no one knows what&#x27;ll stick so it&#x27;s hard to point fingers.<p>That will continue for a while, but some people ARE seeing the writing on the wall, and even advertising agencies that are profiting from the current situation can see it. That&#x27;s what I felt, and I could see the work I did getting less and less relevant.<p>The move I&#x27;m seeing is not just towards brands realizing they&#x27;re running a lot of fuel to move at a slow speed, but also towards agencies becoming more &quot;studios&quot; than &quot;agencies&quot; (an irony in itself considering it&#x27;s the opposite of what started happening 8 or so years ago), and building things FOR and WITH clients rather than some on-off forgettable new shitty online campaign or &quot;viral&quot; crap no one cares about.<p>A great site or application for, say, booking online flights does wonders towards a customer&#x27;s perception of a flight carrier. It makes sense for Delta or Jetblue or anyone to create the best damn flight checkin/booking/etc app so people want to use it. So instead of spending millions in yet another online campaign, they can spend a portion of that creating a damn good app that will be with them for a while. Same applies to so many other businesses.<p>That&#x27;s the kind of move I&#x27;m seeing, at least in the kind of work I do. Advertising won&#x27;t die, banners won&#x27;t die, but they&#x27;ll be the loan sharks of the web.<p>Of course this move also creates a problem, like newspapers that insist on creating their own useless apps.

Also the recent move from Assembla to JIRA clearly doesn't help for now, but I'm confident that things will get more streamlined in the ((hopefully) near) future. I've personally stopped trying to contribute to core/contrib because of the slow process and JIRA (which I've not spent time learning yet (not even sure I've got the right permissions)) so that I can concentrate on libraries.

These ""scientists"" who sell their models of how software development is supposed to work are mostly, in my experience, hucksters. They haven't actually figured it out (no one has), but there's a market for software processes because software is hard and unpredictable, many people want to be told how to do it, and some are prepared to write cheques. People may go into the authority game with good intentions, valid experience, and talent, but without the discipline of hands-on work on real systems (and no, an occasional trip to the client doesn't cut it), it's too easy to fall for one's own hype. All the more because you are surrounded by people who are paying you to tell them what to do and thus themselves have a vested interest in believing that you know.<p>The deep problem underlying this is that we are a long way yet from having large-scale economic organizations suitable for developing software efficiently. My money's on small autonomous units (a.k.a. startups), but that's still a minority view. There's an impedance mismatch between how most people want to fund and run software projects, and the work itself. The markets this mismatch creates (like the market for software processes) are unhealthy ecosystems in polluted environments. But it is very difficult to see that from the inside, especially when you're a high-end consultant with more money and higher status than lowly practitioners.<p>I know of only one way around this conundrum of how to tell bullshit apart from knowledge, and it goes like this: write nontrivial programs and show me the code.

I like to have the tightest possible scoping of names, but a common pattern makes that difficult. If you've got a function that produces a good value or indicates that it couldn't do so one way to write it is:<p><pre><code>  Type theVar;
  if (theFunction(theVar)
    { /*do something with theVar*/ }
</code></pre>
theFunction returns true if it set theVar, false otherwise.
The problem is that theVar's visibility extends beyond our interest in it. The ZQ template lets me write this:<p><pre><code>  if (ZQ<Type> theQ = theFunction())
    { /*do something with theQ.Get()*/}
</code></pre>
and all of a sudden I don't have to come up with anywhere near as many meaningful names as before.<p>To me it's neat because I've found many unanticipated uses for it e.g. wrapping the values in option-specifying structures where a default is cleanly indicated with a default-inited (or subsequently Clear()ed) ZQ, rather than having a separate 'use default' boolean, or 'set default' function.<p><a href=""http://zoolib.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/zoolib/trunk/zoolib/source/cxx/zoolib/ZQ.h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zoolib.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/zoolib/trunk/zoolib...</a>",1293769236

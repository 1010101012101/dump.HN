Assume you're being attacked by a wild animal, which attitude is more helpful out of the following?<p>1) I will do anything to overpower it and kill it, or any acceptable substitute such as distracting or trapping it, or escaping in any other fashion.<p>2) Well, it might be too powerful for me, and maybe I'm too tired, and if it's getting dark I can't see it as well, and I guess I'll try, but it's unreasonable to think I can win, and in this situation having precisely accurate beliefs <i>is</i> my highest priority, so I'll start off by assessing how energetic it looks and estimating how powerful it is before I start doing anything, if it's too big I won't bother.<p>It's ""duh"" obvious that in a survival situation, the former might get you out, the latter might not. It's ""duh"" obvious that <i>you might not win, whatever you do</i>, but that's <i>not relevent</i> because you don't get <i>points for trying</i>, you either survive, or you <i>die</i>.<p>Now, comparing a survival situation to a project, or a company, or any everyday life situation, isn't really a fair comparison. But comparing the attitude you hold <i>can be</i> a fair comparison.<p>By your reply you are implying the OP is so dense they don't understand that some things can't be done. Do you honestly think that's true? You're giving zero credit to their intelligence at all.<p>The ""just do it"" attitude is not <i>supposed</i> to be telling you that ""you can do anything rah rah just will it and it will happen, laws of physics and human limits be damned"".<p>It's <i>supposed</i> to be telling you that hurdles are OK, you will meet them, and you can jump them, or go round them, or plough straight through them, or move them, or pay someone else to move them, or rent a car and drive through them, or burn them down, or argue the race to different track with different hurdles, or setup your own athletics federation and recruit athletes and viewers for races without hurdles, they're all fine, but doing nothing won't help, nor will giving up. If you want to solve a problem, getting points for trying won't get the problem solved.<p>""Just get it done - you can"" isn't meant as a literally true fact you have to <i>agree with</i>, it's a helpful attitude to hold and act on <i>even while knowing it's not literally true</i>.",1321552502

The answer to that debate is always: it depends.<p>For example, looking at mobile web page transitions, jQuery Mobile is way behind the competition in terms of optimization. The slide transitions in Sencha Touch 2 are <i>way</i> smoother than jQuery Mobile. I recently had lunch with one of the Sencha Touch developers and learned that they optimized this by not using CSS3 transitions at all and instead use a different approach with much better results.<p>To pick the best mobile web framework for you, you really need to evaluate what you're looking to get out of it. Then go with the one that has optimized those things which you care about most.<p>I've used both jQuery Mobile and Sench Touch and ultimately I decided I value a small framework codebase and full control of the framework most. Thus, I use a handrolled solution and it's been a great decision for me.",1321552367

Using a mice monoculture model is really bad for this, because there are lots of drugs that would work great in humans but that never get tested because they don't work in mice, and similarly there are tons of drugs that we waste millions of dollars testing solely because they were effective in mice. When looking at the results of mice studies is less predictive of what will work in humans than just looking at anecdotal reports from people, then it means that the scientific model of drug development has basically become less effective than 'alternative medicine' as a source for new ideas, which is problematic for obvious reasons. I have no idea what percentage of drugs with a history of enthnobotanical usage end up being able to demonstrate real efficacy, but I can guarantee it's a hell of a lot better than the 10,000 to 1 figure cited by this article as the rate of drugs that successfully go from petri dish to mice to humans.<p>So then I think we have to ask ourselves, why are we spending our money on mice when actually going out into the rainforest and talking with indigenous people could be literally two orders of magnitude more cost effective. And, much more importantly, why are we genociding indigenous cultures in favor of 'scientific progress', when empirically preserving traditional knowledge is so much more conducive to real progress and understanding. Hundreds of thousands of people throughout history have been willing to die in order to at least try to figure out which drugs work and which don't with the very limited tools they had, so ignoring what they have to teach us is a tragic waste, especially since we probably aren't going to go back to sacrificing millions of people in the name of scientific research any time soon.",1321550065

In order to eliminate spam you'd have to get everyone to completely change the email protocol habits usage etc. There is no way to patch over it. That hasn't and isn't going to happen. Major providers who control access aren't going to go along with any alternate root. And getting people to program in individually alternative dns servers or do anything ""technical"" in nature won't create enough critical mass. (Majority of domain names registered even with the availability of alternate tlds and cctlds are still .com)",1321549377

They have a wealth of data on how I <i>intentionally</i> interact with other Facebook users.<p>But most of the manual features for managing friends are already in place - you can update particular lists of people through groups, events and private messages. It's really not that tricky to decide who you want to invite to that awesome house party or on the cheap trip to Vegas.<p>Other features, such as the ""how do you know them?"" and focus on work/school/city networks seem to have actually been removed due to lack of use despite offering very intuitive and automatic categorisation of friends. Facebook's trajectory towards openness probably reflects a lack of desire towards using it in a structured way.  A hypothetical startup whose main strength is removing the spam in the newsfeed and adding in the features they chose to remove probably isn't going to keep Zuck awake at night. I preferred Facebook before Zynga and gratuitous ""liking"", but I'm not going to persuade my closest friends to move to a clone to get rid of the bloat.<p>FWIW I think Dave's example of friend bloat is probably more a reflection of his social circle than underlying changes in Facebook itself. He'd have had a lot more friends in 2006 if he'd been attending university, and considerably fewer now if he was working 9-5 for an unglamorous small business and nobody read his blog. The number of friends I had grew far faster in early 2006 than in any subsequent period, and people I shared fleeting conversation whilst waiting for lectures with were arguably far more tangentially connected to me than, say, my sister.",1288618732
1856361,comment,1850750,1855544,0,0,roel_v,,,"Well you don't have the uncomfortable feeling, because you rationalize it away by declaring coffee (caffeine) something entirely different from (other_ neural enhancers (in pill form). Cognitive dissonance is, like you say, the uneasy feeling of having two conflicting views at the same time. Your are 'pills are bad' and 'coffee is ok'. (If I may speculate, I'd say the both come from social conditioning, or rather, accepting the mainstream or conventional views on these issues without thinking about them critically. For which nobody can really blame you, I mean if everybody had to second guess every single thing we see every day ('regular' people drinking coffee), we'd get nothing done at all.)<p>Anyway so those are the two views, but when you link them through 'they're both cognitive enhancers', a problem arises. Why is one bad, and the other not? So this is then 'glossed over' or 'smoothed out' by the brain by internalizing a third cognition, namely 'they're not the same'. Note that this third cognition does not have to be elaborated on very much (actually this elaboration is what I asked for, because I don't think any argument in it can hold) to put your mind at ease and 'resolve' the cognitive dissonance.<p>Anyway, my point still stands. I challenge you to explain what is the fundamental difference between taking a chemical in pill form versus taking it in liquid form (this is what it, in my opinion, boils down to). I guess the most obvious argument is going to be that one is man-made and the other 'natural' (which somebody arguing this then usually interprets as ""the precursor is readily available in nature, and extensive treatment in the form of drying, grounding, and preparing with hot water is 'pure' enough to all be 'natural"".) I won't put any words in your mouth, I'm just pre-empting the usual first response and indicating what I see as weaknesses in that argument ;)<p>Finally, for the record, I didn't downvote you as far as I remember, but your comment did rub me the wrong way. The reason being that it states a very strong opinion or position, but offers nothing to rationally substantiate that opinion. On the contrary, the only attempt at convincing the reader seems to be in a 'proof by assertion' strategy, repeated across multiple posts. Furthermore from your claim that people only downvoted you because you hold a different opinion it seems that you are not very willing to critically examine your own position, nor to put in the effort to really (as in, rationally and in a dialectically sound way) defend it. I hope I'm wrong on this of course, I'm just letting you know how these couple of posts came across to me, hoping that this may help you understand why people reacted to your post the way they did (well, 'people', just 3 really, but still).",1288618724

China is in most respects one giant black box. My main concern is that they've done a fairly similar thing to what Britain did back around 2000. When the US hit a recession from the .com bust we responded by opening up the credit taps and made doing anything and everything on cheap credit very easy. We avoided recession but in doing so we caused one hell of a banking/housing/credit bubble ten years later. I suspect the chinese have unfortunately done the same, they've opened up the credit taps hugely in order to glide through the slowdown in the west, but with that much credit sloshing around there will always be problems. I think those problems are China's regional and local governments, who more or less run their own little fiefdoms and have been financing much of their operations from land sales and off balance sheet investments vehicles...",1288618231

Ugly not intelligent?<p>The dating game in this country is broken, as evidence I point at the 50%+ divorce rate.<p>I propose a better solution.  One where a dating website has ""ground rules"" that if you break, you get three strikes and your out.  Rules like you have to respond to the suitor with a reason why you are incompatible.  Rules like if you are chronically offending other people, you get restricted rights.  If you are beautiful and get hundreds of messages and don't respond to any, you get removed from search.  If a suitor comes up, fitting all your criteria for a date, and you don't like them, and can't quote a reason why you don't like them, you get a emblem on your profile that says: ""Profile criteria inaccurate, this person doesn't have any idea what they want"".  Which would encourage one to actually put down what they want in the mate, instead of the fluff that women/men actually put down.<p>This article describes many of the failings of the current dating website methodology and how it could be improved:

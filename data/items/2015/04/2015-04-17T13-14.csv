In a state of non-being one cannot worry, influence, toil, think, experience, or suffer.<p>I look at death very straightforwardly: it is irrelevant to me. I will never experience death. I will therefore, from my perspective, never die. My experiences are bounded by my being and non-being, and self-referentially we are each immortal within the bounds of our own experience.<p>I may one day experience the act of dying, but one does not know one is dying unless one is terminally ill. More often than not one simply either goes to sleep and does not wake, or one goes &quot;gosh, what&#x27;s that thing that&#x27;s about to hit my head?&quot;.<p>Of course one might worry for those one leaves behind - but in most cases, this does the living a disservice, as to think one essential in the life of another is egoistic at best, and controlling and damaging at worst.<p>Hare today, goon tomorrow, and the world will keep turning.",1429279196

The resulting law only allows €1 charges for people under 35 and it does nothing about the other expenses that stifle small businesses:<p>- the payment of anticipated VAT for the next fiscal year as estimated by the government based on this year&#x27;s ledger<p>- the market studies that establish the average income of a similar business in your field and then taxes you according to this hypothetical income if your documented one is bellow average<p>- certain taxes that have a fixed minimum forcing you to reach a certain income immediately or dig yourself deeper into debt<p>- an aversion towards bankruptcy - you are usually guilty of fraud until proven otherwise and the legal process is long and costly<p>- insane fiscal policies like the one forcing retail shops to only have large price reductions 2 months per year, at the season&#x27;s end, after communicating it to the local authorities and only being allowed to charge bellow the acquisition price in certain conditions, as to maximize the state&#x27;s return (they reason that reducing the price also reduces the taxes)<p>While small timers have to deal will all this, big businesses get public money in order to &quot;save the jobs&quot; or protect strategic industries, they get to use the government&#x27;s resources to secure deals abroad and they get to negotiate with the revenue service when they are caught red handed.<p>The signs are clear: become an employee or pay the price of your foolishness.

9394291,comment,9390812,9392734,0,0,taeric,,,"In the example case, though, it isn&#x27;t about giving it a name.  It is about using the name in the first place.  Is no different from:<p><pre><code>    class Foo {
        void test(String arg) {..}
        main(..) {
          Foo foo = new Foo();
          Object s = &quot;sd&quot;;
          foo.test(s); // Boom
        }

Note that if that were instead:<p><pre><code>    class Foo {
        void test(Number arg) {..}
        main(..) {
          Foo foo = new Foo();
          Long n = 4L;
          foo.test(n);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
Then things work, because the subtyping is chosen.  In the generics case, there is no relation between Foo<Number> and Foo<Integer>.  If there were, then the capture could potentially treat Foo<?> as Foo<Object> and then depending on if you went co or contra, could allow the call.",1429279074

This ends up being DMA to pagecache from the file and hopefully DMA to network socket Eg. zero copy. In reality the TCP stack will have some overhead (segmenting).<p>If they have a network stack in userspace you need to make syscalls to for disk IO and you end up making copies from the page cache to your application buffers. You can do DMA from disk to your userspace buffer with O_DIRECT, but then you lose the page cache (and you&#x27;ll end up having to re-implement it in userspace).<p>If you don&#x27;t have disk IO that needs be performed. Say you have a in-memory hash table then you might be able to get a measurable improvement in performance by using a userspace network stack.<p>Lastly, you still need (some) elevated privileges for networking to a TCP in userspace so you end with a vulnerability vector there.",1429279022

Starting from simple things, variable function declarations, so many ways to declare functions, so much theory on var/val/def/lazy/ and how they differ at some corner cases. Function vs. Method stuff in combination with currying/partial application makes things so overcomplicated with so many corner cases which I will never be able to remember. I mean I have many pages of my notes from time I studied Scala, consisting just of corner cases and explanations of why they are present.<p>If you consider how Golang is viewed by many - as huge step back in our knowledge of language design. I consider Scala as step back in what is known in clean code, overall lessons from designing nice products. It just makes me feel like, it betrays everything I care internally and if Scala becomes dominant platform, it would just show to me that we as an industry just don&#x27;t have standards and can accept just anything, we will never have something nice, close to perfect.<p>So my stance on Scala:<p>* If you just want to learn functional programming - pick something else, F# for me looked a lot cleaner and much closer to &quot;1 to 1&quot; - you can just apply functional theory without fighting the language.<p>* If you looking for language to make you happy - don&#x27;t pick Scala. Unless you&#x27;re into &quot;The Abyss&quot; thing @ Crockford.<p>* If this is for the money or because it sucks less than X (e.g. Java) in some ways - Scala is good consideration.",1429278818

Simply put, don&#x27;t avoid the warning signs that it is failing, even if others feel that it isn&#x27;t. Here are a few personal examples:<p>1. You believe that your company will get paying customers (or investors), after &#x27;this thing&#x27; or &#x27;that thing &#x27;happens. You feel like you are holding out too much for these things to happen.<p>2. Your partners seem to act oblivious to the failings of the business model and tend to cling to it. They fail to understand that admitting defeat sooner than later is more important that an idealistic goal and business plan. This failing would be coupled with a dedication that &quot;we need to hold on and keep going if we want to make this happen.&quot;<p>3. Your partner/s do not recognize the importance of their own or your personal welfare, because the goal of the startup is more important. This can be true despite not making any strong sales or establishing investor relationships in the time span of at least six months or more. (I personally say &#x27;six months&#x27; because you have personal finances to attend to. Frankly, six months with absolutely nothing is a sign in itself, in my personal opinion.)<p>4. You feel guilty for giving up. You are also guilted into not giving up.<p>Stop believing you lost your life. At this time, you need to fail fast. Realize that sinking yourself more into risk will create more problems down the line. Leave now. Take your skills and maybe get a job somewhere else and build up your wealth again. I was almost broke myself, with my wife, in another country (which I still am in now.) I failed fast; got my resume out there and a month later, had the movers come to move where I got the job. It was fun, it was sad, but it was a life lesson to be more attentive to this stuff in the future.<p>As a side thought, there might be a lot of glamour around startups these days, but business is still business. If you are going broke, your DOA-startup is nothing to glamourize.<p>I wish the best for you.<p>EDIT: Just as a follow up to this ... I went from the startup to one of the most interesting jobs I have had, given the new programming challenges to work with. Life can lead you down interesting paths. :)",1429277890

Reviews of (in descending order) comics, books, films and albums, for diverse print and digital media. It is possible that those who approached you sincerely would like your take specifically. That does happen, but more often, I have found, is the case of reviewing being a cheap effort at adcopy.<p>Honestly, I feel that aside from family and friends of those responsible for the source work, reviews generally go unread by the bulk of the masses. I really think most PR persons are incredibly lazy, and instead of making efforts to think outside of boxes, rely heavily on the old standbys of reviews, interviews, and press releases (ready for copy and pasting among the blogging elite). If the creator responsible is not &quot;a name&quot;, then PR persons are compelled to get someone, anyone, to view the work. And then, more often than not, the PR persons pray that such person will do the selling for them.<p>I realize this sounds bitter. (I&#x27;ve spent far more efforts on promoting indie creators than I have on developing my own works, to very mixed results.) But ultimately, composing review articles is essentially unpaid adcopy work. I think a strong review should be handled along the lines of a high school book report. The habit can be a neat exercise unto itself, as far as writing in general. But there are many snakes in the grass.<p>All said, if the work/s in question truly strike you (for good or ill), then by all means have a go at formulating your opinion on the matter for others. If only for the sake of trying something new. But be weary of getting locked into it. You do one review, then the publisher or producer may well send you another soon enough.

9394137,comment,9389520,9389520,0,0,htormey,,,"A great documentary miniseries about this topic is War: A Commentary by Gwynne Dyer. In particular, the episode anyone&#x27;s son will do:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28miniseries%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28miniseries%29</a>
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DShDaJXK5qo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DShDaJXK5qo</a><p>The episode covers what goes into training young people who enter the marine core. It features candid interviews with drill sergeants and the recruits themselves about their motivations. Well worth a watch.<p>One of the main points the episode makes is that the job of being a soldier is ultimately about killing and dying, something that doesn’t come naturally to most people. The method for turning young men into soldiers is basic training.<p>According to Dyer the secret of basic training is that its not really about teaching people, its about changing people.
He claims that if you want to change people quickly and radically, you put them in a place where the only right way to think and behave is the way you want them to. You isolate them and then apply enormous physical and mental pressure. i.e basic training. Essentially he claims that basic training is all about brain washing.<p>In the linked interview Sebastian Junger talks a lot about what it means to be a man. In particular:<p>“In that kind of environment,” Junger continues. “If you dare talk about what it means to be a man, what you’re saying is men are different from women.”<p>and<p>“We aren’t asking, ‘What does it mean to be a human being?’” he says. “‘What’s it mean to be a man?’ Once you have that conversation you offend a lot of academics.”<p>and<p>“Men are clearly wired for [war],” he continues. “The male response to war is an evolutionary adaptation that clearly works for our species.”<p>He doesn&#x27;t quite claim that young mens desire to go to war has its roots purely in biology but he comes close. Personally I don&#x27;t buy it.<p>I think the concept of going to war as a rite of passage, particularly in the USA, is a social construct that’s largely the result of pervasive propaganda. The US military has an impressive marketing budget and aggressively recruits in schools right across the country. In the US, joining the military is not seen as a weird or embarrassing thing to do. In contrast, in my country (Ireland), joining the military is seen as a somewhat odd choice.<p>What’s interesting about Dyer’s documentary is that it interviews recruits before they go through basic training. Many of them are poor with few job prospects and no sense of direction. The military gives them a sense of purpose and is socially acceptable thing to do.",1429277459

If you build a big service, something will eventually fail, Bloomberg is no different, if anything they are much better than Reuters or CapIQ for availability.<p>I saw this quote from another comment here:<p>>  but the widespread reliance on the $10k+ per year terminal in the financial services industry means that this thing is ripe for disruption.<p>I completely disagree, Bloomberg isn&#x27;t some slow lethargic big company.  They iterate relentlessly, their help desk is the best I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of dealing with.<p>If I&#x27;ve got a problem with the trading system, their first level help will get me to a technical specialist in that area in under 30 seconds.  If they can&#x27;t solve it then I&#x27;ll talk to a developer in 30 minutes.<p>Bloomberg is the leader in teh financial space, not only because their tech is the best in teh business, but because they listen to their customer better than their competitors, they release more frequently, and when they want to enter an area( say risk management) they go out and buy someone who is already a leader in that field.<p>In short they never stop running, if anything they are increasing the distance between them and their &quot;peers&quot;.<p>As one example, they just posted a message to every Bloomberg terminal user telling us that the issue was an internal networking issue that has been solved.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> to answer this question:<p>> How do they protect the ticker tape thing from attacks, like say, a DDOS?<p>2 things:<p>1) This question really doesn&#x27;t make sense.  How do you DDOS a one way line?  They send you quotes for the tickers that you request.  You can&#x27;t really DDOS them, unless you do something like request tickers over and over again in a tight loop, in which case their api will rate limit you.<p>2) its a closed system.  Only terminal users can access it and only through the bloomberg terminal or their api, so they control all the access points.",1429277424

While these cases are always launched claiming to be on the side of the angels, they ultimately ignore that all that extra legal overhead is not free, and only the currently large companies will be able to manage it, essentially barring any smaller competitors from entering the market.

Once you set this precedent, it will only be the deep-pocketed companies that can afford to put drivers on their payroll.

So they begrudgingly choose it because it has some of what they want, but they are forever wishing it was better & making their frustrations known.<p>Then there&#x27;s the other side, which are developers coming from Java (or other OO languages) after hearing about the benefits of FP/Scala.

To me, this usage of sharing a math graph is just a Schelling Point.[1]<p>Twenty years ago, residents had these huge paper phone books.  It had the yellow pages listing businesses (the pre-internet version of Yahoo! directory pages).  It also had blue pages in the front with all kinds of information:  time-of-day phone number, first aid instructions for choking or ingesting poison (along with phone# for poison control center).  In Florida, it also had maps with emergency evacuation routes in case of a hurricane.  When the phone books expired at the end of the year, they could be repurposed as cheap door stops or booster chairs to feed toddlers.  The phone books were something universal that <i>everybody had shared knowledge about</i>.  Maybe it seemed like the phone company had a monopoly on disseminating non-phone related information but those books were yesterday&#x27;s Schelling Point.  Society has moved away from them.<p>I think this method of sharing a url from google is another harmless Schelling Point but I can be convinced otherwise.  Monetizing people&#x27;s curiosity about &quot;x sin(y)&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of a threat.  Wikipedia and Youtube are other Schelling Points.  If I&#x27;m curious about an obscure music track; I just go to youtube.com because I&#x27;m conditioned to think that somebody somewhere already uploaded it.<p>Not sure what people expect the alternative should be.  Should users who want to share graphs alternate URLs between google.com and wolframalpha.com?[1]<p>To me, the real threat from Google Inc isn&#x27;t the Shelling Point aspect but the mountains of behavioral data they collect on users from search + Android location data + Gmail that can be used against them.  The data can be misused to discriminate employment to job seekers or deny health insurance for the sick.

If you need to work to earn a living then work. Don&#x27;t mind what people might say if you put your startup on hold. Who cares about them? Do you think they care about you or your startup? No. They probably would talk behind your back for awhile. But who cares. What is important now is for you to live your life the way you wanted to. Life won&#x27;t be back in an instant.

It is harder to raise money in a poor country. It is also sad to realize that unlike the Western countries where angel investors or incubators/accelerator are willing to shell out money just to test if there is a market for the idea even if they have no product at all. In a poor country, even if you have a prototype ready and you need funding to test it to the market, your prototype is nothing and you will be valued way way less than what you really are. Until you can actually prove that it is a viable business or maybe you have actual customers, then that&#x27;s the only time they are willing to risk it. In a poor country, nobody feels safe to invest on you. It&#x27;s all about risk management.<p>It is also sad to see that investors (from other countries), doesn&#x27;t believe that the next billion dollar company can come from a third world country or maybe from a third world country founder.<p>But as a startup founder and as an individual, those &quot;facts-for-now&quot; doesn&#x27;t stop me from building things, nor does it stop me from innovating, or stop me from building my startups, and that doesn&#x27;t stop me from believing that I can build the next billion dollar startup. I know I have to step up my game and give 2-10x more the effort provided by the privilege people, but that won&#x27;t stop me from fighting and believing.

True, you could change the return type of them (which would require you to do just as much refactoring as if you changed a public internal data structure) or change the internal data structure and cast to the return type but many times that will make the getter/setter meaningless.<p>This is all not to mention that since the setter is public, you don&#x27;t have any protection of your internal data structure anyway since anyone can modify it.<p>It&#x27;s true that getters/setters offer thread-safety; I&#x27;m happy to concede that.<p>However, the performance impact is not FUD (or at least, I did not mean it as such); ask any systems programmer and they will happily tell you that one of the most common optimizations you can make is removing function calls where they are unneeded. Another comment mentioned that the JVM can JIT this problem away through inlining; I honestly do not know if that it is true—if it is, then great; that would be a significant benefit over this same kind of formulation in, say, Cxx.<p>Finally though, I don&#x27;t really understand why Java programmers cling to backwards compatibility so when their own language shows you what happens when you commit to never removing anything to avoid breakage (i.e., you build in a huge amount of cruft).<p>Keep in mind, none of my posts are meant to be flamey here; I was just giving my opinion of one of the patterns displayed in the FAQ that I find distressing.",1429276230

9394019,comment,9393551,9393551,0,0,ericssmith,,,"I have used Scala for building business solutions since 2012. I had been maintaining PHP and Rails systems of 50k to 150k LOC prior to the switch. I still have to maintain PHP and Rails systems. The move to Scala was driven by the need for better performance, system resiliency, and to mitigate the effect of multiple developers coming in & out of a codebase. It turns out to be ideal for this.<p>Idiomatic Scala is not a grab bag of features or paradigms. It is firmly based on programming with expressions and using the type system to improve abstraction. Statements and mutable data structures show up when interfacing with external systems or for performance reasons. The Collections libraries are arguably &quot;object-oriented&quot; as that term is commonly understood, but this is not typical for application code. However, object-oriented features such as objects, classes, and traits are the basis of Scala&#x27;s module capabilities.<p>For programmers coming from 20th century mainstream languages that are all based on programming with statements, mutable variables, and are arguably a thin abstraction over the machine itself, programming with Scala can be a challenge. If you want to do your familiar imperative style of programming, Scala is going to be painful. Use another language. But if you would benefit from a type system and good support for expressions, then Scala is possibly the best choice currently for growing business applications. We are not in 2005 any more.<p>Scala is not ideal as an introduction to functional programming. Other languages, such as F#, SML, OCaml, and Haskell have better, simpler syntactic support for features associated with functional programming.<p>People who dislike on Scala are probably either stuck in the past or don&#x27;t have pain that Scala would solve.",1429276137

The problem is that while you can find negatives of the normal network, you can&#x27;t find enough positives for bitcoin. Also, the failures seem much bigger -- when MtGox failed it was the biggest exchange, and everyone lost everything. Such a thing has (in modern times) never happened with the normal monetry system, and couldn&#x27;t happen (because governments wouldn&#x27;t let it).<p>I trust my bank to look after my money more than I trust a bitcoin exchange, or myself not to misplace a vital private key / get my wallet stolen. The idea that bitcoins are largely untraceable and unrecoverable does not to me (I&#x27;m afraid) seem like an advantage.<p>Further, from a technical viewpoint, it seems to me I&#x27;m just replacing one series of masters with another -- 2/3 of all bitcoins are already in circulation, so the &quot;1%&quot; (current users) of bitcoin are already extremely wealthy. The idea that bitcoin is uncentralised and uncontrollable seems false, when 2 or 3 (or 1?) large mining groups effectively control the bitcoin network, and can (and have) just &quot;stopped&quot; it for a while to sort out problems.",1429276034

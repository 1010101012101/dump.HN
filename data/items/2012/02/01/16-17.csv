This just inserts 1000 words into a <ul> in three different ways. With jQuery, by appending each item separately, with jQuery through string concatenation, and with Serenade. I tested this repeatedly with different numbers of words, in different orders and on different browsers.<p>jQuery with append is around 5x SLOWER than Serenade\njQuery with an entire template is around an order of magnitude FASTER than Serenade<p>In other words, the difference in how jQuery is used is way bigger than the difference to using Serenade.<p>I then did another dirty benchmark: <a href=""http://pastie.org/3296747"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/3296747</a>. I've only added a primitive event binding so that clicking the <li>s pops open an alert. A really interesting thing happens. In IE (7,8,9), the difference shrinks to around a factor 5.

3538729,comment,3538134,3538392,10,0,jherdman,,,"There are a few comments in this post that touch on the flaws of this API. Here's the gist:<p>1. HTTP methods are improperly used. The documentation states ""All API calls should be sent as a GET HTTP request"". GET is used to retrieve resources, and should be cacheable. It should NEVER change the state of a resource. Yet we see in that it's used to delete, create, and modify resources! Examples:<p>GET <a href=""https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder.aspx?op=create.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder.aspx?op=create..</a>.<p>GET <a href=""https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/file.aspx?op=delete"" rel=""nofollow"">https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/file.aspx?op=delete</a><p>These <i>should</i> be as follows:<p>POST <a href=""https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder.aspx</a><p>DELETE <a href=""https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/file.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/file.aspx</a><p>HTTP verbs have specific semantics that allow for intelligent, scalable architecture.<p>2. Individual resources are not identified by an unchangeable URI. Let's say I want a folder:<p>GET <a href=""https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder.aspx?op=get&id=123"" rel=""nofollow"">https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder.aspx?op=get&...</a><p>Nope. This is more RESTful:<p>GET <a href=""https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder/123"" rel=""nofollow"">https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder/123</a><p>Two things to note: 1) no 'aspx' bullshit, that's implementation and shouldn't be visible to the user, and 2) the ID is in the URI itself as opposed to the params. URIs should seldom, if ever, change. Parameter names may change, URIs shouldn't.<p>3. Violation of content type retrieval. Let's say I want a folder as XML:<p>GET <a href=""https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder.aspx?op=get&id=123&fmt=xml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder.aspx?op=get&...</a><p>Wrong. This is the request I should be sending as a curl:<p>curl <a href=""https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder/123"" rel=""nofollow"">https://subdomain.sharefile.com/rest/folder/123</a> -H 'Accept: text/xml'<p>Note that I'm using the Accept header. This allows for flexibility in accessing my resource. With any luck, the server will give me an XML file, and its content type should be ""text/vnd.sharefile+xml"" (vendor specific content types are best).<p>4. No link relations in the body. I'm mostly assuming this because I haven't seen sample response bodies, but almost <i>no one</i> does this even though is a crucial aspect of a RESTful service. RESTful services describe the relationship between resources. Suppose I have an ordered collection of files. When retrieving a file, it should describe its relationship in this ordered collection. This is done either via the LINK header, or some sort of scheme in your response body (e.g. JSON Schema describes 'link' attributes).<p>A pretty good RESTful API is Github's (see <a href=""http://developer.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.github.com/</a>).

But, that effort needs to be balanced with continuing to meet the needs and interests of users. Every business finds its own balance and attracts users who share those priorities.

Love creating awesome user experiences?  Keep reading.<p>THE MISSION<p>Swipely revolutionizes how local merchants do business, arming them with innovative technology that puts the clunky, archaic systems used by big retailers to shame. We're the Robin Hood of business, disrupting the payment space to enable the little guys to do what only the big guys can, and then some. We interact directly with both merchants and their customers, impacting the personal experience on both sides in deep, meaningful ways. We turn rewards and loyalty upside-down (or, as we see it, rightside-up!) by giving points and discounts to customers through their credit card, without the need for special cards, mobile apps, bar codes, or anything else that gets in the way of the experience. We analyze every payment transaction, providing intuitive reports and automated tools for merchants that use them to grow and deeply engage their customers. And that's just the beginning of the possibilities with our passionate team, unique resources, and mission to make our merchants successful!<p>THE OPPORTUNITY<p>Combine a world-class front-end team with a powerfully creative atmosphere, and you get a compelling culture that liberates us all to envision and realize innovative product ideas every day. You will push your own limits of what you think is possible with a user experience. You will propose and refine new concepts, comps, technologies, and solutions, and get the support needed across the company to realize the untapped potential we have yet to discover.  You will work with top sales, marketing, and product talent that deeply values innovation and the engineers that drive it.<p>Evolution is our greatest ally. We built the first incarnation of Swipely with jQuery, experimented with Backbone yet quickly realized we needed more structure, and now cruise on YUI3, with YUI3.5 around the corner. We rock MVC-driven, single-page applications, fully templatized Handlebars views, restful JSON persistence to our Rails backends, frontend unit and integration tests, and (soon!) a pushState architecture with hot data visualizations.<p>We always track and contribute to new technologies like D3, Node.js, Ember, Harmony, CoffeeScript, and Less. Exploration and collaboration are part of our culture, and any topic that can improve our engineering efforts is fair game, including NoSQL storage, Nginx/Unicorn architecture, and deployment and continuous integration tools.<p>THE REQUIREMENTS<p>You love what you do. You wake up every day more passionate about the webs IxD models and UX than the day before. You demand the highest quality of your projects and want to work with people who demand and inspire the same, from the code down to the pixels. You get energized when opening new Fireworks and Photoshop comps and diving deep with designers.<p>You are self-directed and take initiative with confidence, yet know when to include others. You communicate effectively and thoughtfully. You appreciate the value of documentation. You are accountable for the entire user experience, from conception to production.<p>You love contributing to opensource. Your Github profile is a hive of exciting collaborations. You strive to learn and shape emerging projects. You lead and inspire others with your own applications and sites in your free time. You go out for drinks with your friends and have engrossing discussions about the web. You love freenode.<p>Your JavaScript knowledge is one of your greatest assets. You instinctively understand where native JavaScript ends and frameworks begin. Your extensive experience with MVC and design patterns guides you to insightful and intuitive solutions. You are eager to define new TDD and BDD frontend flows. Youre gratified that your language of choice is currently the most popular on Github and is evolving in leaps and bounds on the server-side. You love your backend developer. You regard as common knowledge that robust, performant code is integral to a compelling UX.<p>Your HTML5 and CSS3 expertise expands as fast as the specs are updated. You shiver with anticipation for Level 4 CSS selector support, consistent gradient rule syntax, and native grid layouts. You rock the Chrome Dev channel and wish the Safari updates were out already. You crave responsive design. You know when to go web versus native.<p>THE BENEFITS<p>Swipely is small yet growing rapidly with explosive signup rates (seriously, off the charts!) offering Silicon Valley style startup perks and more. We've got you covered on hardware -- configure your own laptop and bring on the Happy Hacker keyboards, dual-monitors, and pairing stations. Travel expenses, conference tickets, industry and social events?  Check!  Aeron chairs, daily catered lunches from the finest restaurants around (they are our merchant partners, after all!), all the snacks, beverages, and happy hours you can handle?  Done, done, and done!<p>Residing at 39 Pike Street in the Creative Capital that is Providence, you'll find us strategically located between the humming downtown and the vibrant campuses of Brown and the Rhode Island School of Design, a block away from the best coffee shop in the city.<p>Everyone in our company, from sales to engineering, is searching for you RIGHT NOW and wants to be working with you yesterday. Do us a favor; reach out and tell us about yourself.<p>Please send your resume and github profile to uxeng+y212@swipely.com  include a portfolio if available.",1328114158

3538661,comment,3536713,3537845,1,0,drostie,,,"I thought you were arguing <i>against</i> the magic of Python. :P<p>The point I'm making is I suppose one about personal mental hygiene, but I am choosing an odd language for it. Because I am talking about how computers can reason for us, and can help us reason. Python will not complain about x.lower() until it actually occurs; it doesn't reason at all about x. On the other hand, the Python interpreter gives you some leeway to sit inside the code as it's being run, to say ""okay, what can I do with x now that I have it?"" -- which is a start.<p>It's especially pivotal for me when I'm working with an external software package which isn't well-documented. I hate working with someone else's packages in Lisp. With Python, I can usually reverse-engineer what they were thinking pretty easily. With Java, your code editor provides another method to do the same thing, preventing you from writing things which wouldn't have made sense to the package designers -- this helps you know what <i>does</i> make sense, to help you understand what they were thinking.<p>Like I said, my broader point is about mental hygiene, and there is a missing connection between mental hygiene and what computers can do for me. I think this is best summarized by Minsky and Sussman's reminder: ""programming is a good medium for expressing poorly understood and sloppily formulated ideas."" That's the missing connection. When I have a function which I don't completely understand, assigning it to a namespace helps me to be formal and precise about the situations where it is useful, and allows me to reason about the situations where it is not useful.<p>So for all that it might pride me that I can just look up the array API on developer.mozilla.org and quickly learn the difference between ""shift"", ""splice"", and ""unshift"", that's not as important to me. It's something more poignant that interests me, something about how, when I have a string, my brain quickly reasons about what functions are correct for it. I don't know how much Hungarian notation you've worked with, but the property-based notation has some Hungarian quirk to it where you can just feel that you've got the right sort of expression.",1328114125

I purchased it used, owned it for about 27 months, and it was covered under the original warranty for the first 12k miles I put on it, then under a powertrain-only warranty offered by the dealership. Ultimately, I came out of pocket twice to get the automatic passenger window functioning again, and had to replace a fuel canister -- total out-of-pocket for me: ~$1000. I also had the coils replaced (under recall), and ultimately ended up in the shop with a major engine problem, totaling ~$2400. Fortunately, the 2nd powertrain warranty covered it.<p>All said, I was so tired of the ""check engine"" light coming on that I put it on Craigslist for a reasonable price, and sold it in a week. Incidentally, the day before I was to meet the new owner at her bank -- after all, it had been 3 months since the major engine problem -- the electronic display in the center console started to flicker and dim. The new owner was financing it, and was to hand over $500 in cash, but I told her about the problem and said she could keep the cash -- ""You're likely going to need it"" -- if she still wanted to proceed with the purchase. She did, and I am so happy to be rid of that car.<p>I've been driving my wife's '99 Honda Civic since, and while I've had a couple of minor problems with it, I wouldn't hesitate to drive that car anywhere today. So, if you can live without luxury, buy a reliable brand -- e.g., Toyota, Honda -- that is several years old, or if you have more to spend, most 2009 and newer vehicles will be reliable or perhaps still under warranty. If you desire used luxury, pay more for a Lexus or Acura, and stay away from a German car not made in the last couple of years or not under warranty with a dealership (read: repair shop) just down the street.<p>One last note: that Audi was the best car I've ever owned when it was running.

As with all things beautiful, this is tough to illustrate, so I'll use an analogy here from Physics.<p>Page ""xv"" of the book ""A course in mathematics for students of physics"" (volume 2) by Paul Bamberg and Shlomo Sternberg contains a table (do a ""look inside"" on Amazon) that shows four forms of Maxwell's equations as they evolved over the course of history. Each change expresses what the previous one did, but contributes something more that wasn't possible or was very difficult to express with the earlier form.<p>The <i>first</i> form explicitly uses cartesian coordinates. The <i>second</i> form is the vector notation, which helps conceptualize and work with the equations in any coordinate system appropriate to the problem (circular, cylindrical, etc.). The <i>third</i> is the relativistic ""four-vector"" formulation, which, though it says the same thing as the vector form, allows extension to curved spacetime. The <i>fourth</i> exterior calculus formulation (which just reads ""dF = 0, and F = J""!) covers all of the preceding ones, and <i>also</i> takes exactly the same form when applied to circuits (the kirchoff laws, etc.) which is not something you can say for the preceding forms, while allowing generalization to higher dimensions. The mathematical machinery invented for that simple looking expression is incredibly beautiful (and that book does a great job of its exposition, imo).<p>This kind of beauty in software is <i>very</i> desirable in my opinion and we do have examples like MapReduce to show for it. Yes the machinery to do a distributed MapReduce is complex, but the concept is simple and flexible and has a bit of the ""exterior calculus"" fragrance to it. Another is continuations in Scheme - which not only can replace any ""mundane"" control transfer (break, continue, throw, catch, and ilk) but can do much more than just those and lets you roll your own too.<p>I believe <i>that</i> is the kind of beauty we should be striving for in software, not just the ""pretty code"" kind.<p>(minor edits)",1328112428

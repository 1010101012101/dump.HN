Our management team really does try to help out, but there is also some pressure to participate in lab-wide activities that leads to tension (e.g. no, I don&#x27;t really want to sing, dance  at the gala this year). While working, side conversations are often in Chinese (I speak Chinese better than most of us, but still not enough to participate very well), and there are all sorts of comical culture shock experiences even after being here for 7 years. And really, what can be expected when the workplace is 90%+ one way? I think our lab handles it as best as it can.<p>Here is the twist: there is no pressure to assimilate because well, I could never be Chinese. But back in the states (or even Europe), I don&#x27;t feel like I really fit in either despite matching the ethnic and gender standard. There is not much to match me to my colleagues, and there is a lot of pressure to assimilate since at first glance, I should be able to.",1415145228

This is my full-time project, and I&#x27;m paying another full-time dev (less than he&#x27;s worth) out of my own pocket, but we&#x27;re more than happy to welcome contributions from others.  An interview with my co-founder was just published in Linux Magazine: <a href=""http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Snowdrift.coop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Snowdrift.coop</a>  Drop in on IRC if you want to get involved!<p>I&#x27;ve also got a chore tracking site that I put together for my household, which my wife and I have been finding valuable.  It needs some work before I do anything substantially public with it, but I&#x27;ll share if anyone&#x27;s interested.<p>Aside from that, there are a few things I&#x27;d like to have or see explored:<p>I&#x27;d like a notification daemon that lets me review recent messages and batch notifications by priority.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a file system (I&#x27;ve been calling it &quot;cronfs&quot;) that lets you place filesystem objects in time.  Working right, you could implement cron atop this in a couple lines using dnotify to watch a &quot;now&quot; subdirectory.  A big advantage of this is that you can trivially do level testing (&quot;should this service be up?&quot;) instead of just the edge triggers that cron supports, but I&#x27;d also like to see what else would grow out of it.<p>I&#x27;d like to see exploration of &quot;genies&quot; and an implementation of more of them.  Genies are a framework (conceptual more than code, so far) for long running individual tasks requiring repeated interaction in the shell.  The name is meant to invoke &quot;not quite a daemon&quot; or &quot;a kind of daemon&quot;.  The idea is that when you invoke a genie it registers with your shell before dropping into the background, future commands can be easily sent to the genies associated with your current shell, associated genies can be polled for updates before rendering the prompt, and the meaning of commands doesn&#x27;t shift between polls/commands.  I have a (hacky) libpurple client implemented this way, as well as associated scripts: <a href=""https://github.com/dlthomas/genies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dlthomas/genies</a><p>Something I think would be worthwhile, but might be sticky politically/socially, is adding a couple new capabilities in terminfo and building out support in screen/tmux and enough terminal emulators to be meaningful.  There&#x27;s two things I would like to see here.  The less controversial is a way of signalling &quot;this is a notification, get it to the user appropriately&quot; - which urxvt should send to dmesg, ConnectBot should turn into an Android message, screen/tmux should forward if they&#x27;re able and just note if they&#x27;re not, &c.  More controversial is a way of rendering graphics within a subset of characters that are then still treated like characters - there have been a few attempts in this area, none has quite worked out.  Rich terminals in general - historical and future -are an interesting research topic.<p>I also have some things I&#x27;d like to blog about, but they probably <i>are</i> too personal to hand off, at least in the sense that explaining them in enough detail for someone else to write them would basically be writing them myself.<p>I may add more as I think of them, but I should go do some cleaning...",1415144150

Not to say that I could have possibly articulated <i>why</i> I felt such a need to get away from the employers of the day, but one can reminisce...<p>Back then I was doing on-site tech support for a market-data software company serving the major investment banks of the time (a major partner and competitor to Knight Ridder, DTN, and Reuters for those who might have any idea).  My days we very full, supporting DOS-based servers and workstations; In the evenings I spent my hours working on an intranet, which, as I understand, still remains in what&#x27;s left of the expired once-incredibly-successful company.<p>Soon after, I was laid off as the company downsized to almost nothing.  As I took on a couple jobs from former customer contacts, I found it far too easy to waste time on the clock.  I hated it.  I hated the water cooler.  I hated the extended lunches.  Getting paid relatively well for little output was nice in a way, as I had plenty of friends my own age back home who would kill for such a position and wage.  But it wasn&#x27;t for me.  I didn&#x27;t care as much about wasting company resources (though I did care), but I felt it was a complete waste of my own time.<p>Within a year of being laid off, I went full-time freelance, and within three years I was able to pick my clients.  Most of the time, my contacts at my clients&#x27; companies were as incredibly intelligent as they were underutilized.  At odd hours, we&#x27;d get into the nitty gritty of what was <i>really</i> needed for the client to succeed and I was able to propose interesting solutions, not only to offer what was asked, but what would take them further.  And my attempts to give credit to said employees usually (not always) seemed to fall upon deaf ears.<p>As a freelance developer, I was able to continue to pick clients, work on interesting things, meet incredibly interesting people, get the job done, all from my own desk on my own time, and when it was done - move on.  Meanwhile, I saw friends and contacts fall into stagnation as they remained underutilized.  Some happy, with the stability to support their families and lifestyles.  Many, less so.<p>I&#x27;m obviously very lucky as a programmer - someone who can jump into almost any industry, learn as much as possible about their needs, remain busy for as long as the project exists, and then move on.  I think that&#x27;s what drives my interest in software more than anything.  Provided I can ask the right questions to the right people, there is never a shortage of interesting things to figure out for a good wage.  I don&#x27;t pity those who don&#x27;t currently have such an option, as that would undermine the respect I have for them.<p>But I do firmly believe the closer we get to enabling such a world for those of us who are not so well versed in translating business requirements to tech solutions would be a societal benefit.  I certainly don&#x27;t think everyone should be a business entity unto themselves.

8559665,comment,8556578,8559601,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>&quot;The post I was replying to seemed to imply that Hans Christian Andersen somehow had economic incentive to create his works even though they would enter the public domain because later Disney would create Frozen.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s not what I said, and not what I meant to imply. But if that&#x27;s what you inferred from my post, then I&#x27;ll accept full responsibility for having been unclear. That&#x27;s my fault. I think you and I are in less disagreement than you might think.<p>What I meant to say:<p>1. Andersen created &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; 169 years before Disney released <i>Frozen</i>. In pretty much any copyright regime around the world, Andersen&#x27;s copyright would have expired long before Disney started work on <i>Frozen</i>. That includes any posthumous copyright periods, during which the IP presumably passed to Andersen&#x27;s heirs. [1]<p>2. My point about the public domain, and economic incentives, had more to do with Disney. It is sometimes claimed, by Disney and by others, that the public domain is a bad thing. If works fall into the public domain, or so this argument goes, then they enter a sort of &quot;deadpool.&quot; Nobody will touch them again. They&#x27;ll become commodities. They&#x27;ll lose their inherent value. Only the original creators (or heirs) of a property have a rational economic incentive, and the necessary creative skill, to profit from the property. I reject this logic. By way of example, I pointed to two properties -- Sherlock Holmes and &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; -- that fell into the public domain, and whose public-domain status has not stopped others from coming along and revitalizing them. The case of &quot;Snow Queen&quot;/<i>Frozen</i> is particularly interesting, in that you have a party (Disney) reaching into the public domain to find gold (<i>Frozen</i>), yet still fighting tooth and nail to keep its own properties out of the public domain. There&#x27;s a wonderful irony there.<p>On a separate note: Hans Christian Andersen and/or his heirs absolutely deserved a royalty from any profits earned off of &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; during the lifetime of their copyright to it. By any legal measure, that lifetime had come and gone by the time Disney got around to making <i>Frozen</i>.<p>[1] To the best of my understanding (IANAL), current US copyright law holds that a creator of a work owns the copyright for his or her lifetime, plus 50 years after his or her death -- during which time the copyright passes to whomever the creator designated as an heir. After those 50 posthumous years are over, the work becomes public domain. I&#x27;ll admit, however, that I have <i>no</i> idea what copyright law looked like in Denmark in 1844. :)",1415143049

Hence a tech company in Copenhagen has as a &quot;feeder&quot; not only Danish schools but also to a significant extent Spanish schools, Greek schools, Romanian schools, etc.<p>(If not rectified in some way that will produce other problems, since countries like Greece and Romania are spending a bunch of money to train engineers, many of whom emigrate immediately, going to contribute to the economies of places like Denmark, Germany, or the UK rather than finding a role in the local economy.

Since both iOS and Android are unicode-based, the easiest thing was to get them officially added to Unicode.",1415142547
8559630,comment,8552296,8555607,0,0,eridius,,,"> <i>With iOS 7, Apple took a step backward and started letting others lead.</i><p>What do you mean by that? iOS 7 saw the introduction of a new design, with new design language, created entirely by Apple rather than mimicking other companies. Superficially it may appear more similar to other companies because of the loss of skeuomorphism, but once you look past the fact that it&#x27;s flatter than before, it&#x27;s still quite distinct from Microsoft and Google and everyone else. So given all that, what does &quot;letting others lead&quot; mean?<p>> <i>suddenly everyone had a flat boxy design</i><p>Apple&#x27;s design is flatter than before, but it&#x27;s not <i>flat</i>. If anything, the blur and parallax create an even deeper design than it was when it was skeuomorphic. Microsoft is definitely going with the very flat design. Google&#x27;s new design language I haven&#x27;t looked at very much, but I think it&#x27;s safe to say it&#x27;s relatively flat as well, though probably not as flat as Microsoft.<p>> <i>Meanwhile Apple had lost Steve Jobs and fired Scott Forstall, the two people who were pro skeumorphism and would have never allowed Apple to go down that path</i><p>I find it rather distasteful to invoke the memory of Steve to try and make a point like this. Did you know Steve personally? I doubt it. Similarly, I doubt you can predict what he would have done. Steve was rather (in)famous for his ability to change his mind and do things he&#x27;d previously said would never happen. Without Forestall, I think it&#x27;s quite possible that Jony could have convinced Steve to go with the new design.<p>As for Forestall, yes, he would have never let this happen. But that&#x27;s usually considered to be a point against Forestall, not a point for him. The Mac / iOS dev community, and the wider tech press, generally had the opinion that Apple kept going with skeuomorphism for much longer than they should have, and that it was Forestall&#x27;s fault, and that the ousting of Forestall was a change for the good. So I find it quite odd to see you implying that Forestall&#x27;s ousting was a bad move.<p>> <i>A lot of people liked the skeumorphic designs.</i><p>Who are these people? Serious question here.<p>Skeuomorphism is generally considered a good thing to have when introducing new interaction metaphors. It allows people to recognize the widget and instinctively know how to manipulate it. See a button? Push it. A slider? Slide it. Etc. But skeuomorphism is also considered to hold back design and be visually clunky and distracting once users have learned to feel natural with the interaction. This can be seen time and time again in the evolution of GUI platforms. Take for example Mac OS X. The original OS X was full of skeuomorphic touches, such as the very blobby shadowed buttons. And successive versions of OS X slowly kept reducing it, removing the visual distractions, removing the excess skeuomorphism. It was a slow evolution, but if you go back and look at screenshots of OS X 10.0, and try to imagine a new platform introducing that look today, it should be obvious that it would be widely ridiculed.<p>The iPhone introduced a brand new interaction metaphor to the general population. Yes, the technology existed before, but almost exclusively stylus-based, mimicking desktop OS interaction, and only used by a fraction of the population. The iPhone was, almost everyone, their first experience with handheld touchscreen devices (and many of those hadn&#x27;t used stylus-based devices either). Beyond the novelty of actually touching the screen, Apple also had to come up with new gesture-based interactions that they had to teach users. In this context, skeuomorphism is very useful. It makes it obvious to users what can be tapped or dragged or swiped. But as the years went by, and as every other smartphone manufacturer immediately started copying Apple, the skeuomorphism became a hindrance. People didn&#x27;t need the visual affordance to tell what was a tappable button anymore, or to understand that the colored navigation bar at the top was a distinct UI element from the content below it. Skeuomorphism outlasted its utility, and thus, once the last holdout (Forestall) was gone, it was excised from the OS.<p>You can certainly argue they went to far in some cases. For example, the navigation bar buttons lost their borders and just became text. Was that a mistake? Well, that&#x27;s a highly subjective question. But from a usability perspective, it certainly seems like it wasn&#x27;t, since everyone has already learned that content on the left and right edges of the navigation bar is tappable.<p>> <i>Not to mention textures work way better than transparent colors when you&#x27;re watching, say, a video with a white background so you can&#x27;t even see the controls.</i><p>What are you talking about? The OS-provided video controls are displayed on top of a neutral grey background (with blur). This is easily readable no matter the video content. The only video player that comes to mind that might have this issue is the YouTube app, which uses custom controls (which has no relation to the OS design).<p>> <i>Oh and hey, try swiping up from the bottom in the Camera app - Whoops!</i><p>Whoops? What whoops? It behaves exactly like I thought it would; the little arrow control shows up indicating that a second swipe will pull up Control Center. That&#x27;s exactly what I expected to happen, since the Camera app hides the status bar. And in the Camera Roll it brings up Control Center with a single swipe, since the status bar is visible there.<p>What are you seeing that elicited the &quot;whoops&quot;?<p>> <i>And what&#x27;s with the puke neon green for status bars during phonecalls that you can hardly read white text on?</i><p>I hope you aren&#x27;t seeing &quot;puke green&quot;, because if so you might need your eyes checked. As for reading text, that&#x27;s fairly hyperbolic. White text isn&#x27;t as readable as it is on a black background, but it&#x27;s still quite readable. I just tried it out, and the text was just as readable on that green background as it is across most of the OS. Besides, what are you actually trying to read on it? The only text on it besides the status bar is &quot;Touch to return to call&quot;.<p>> <i>What&#x27;s with the complete breakage of the browser UI with a subsequent &quot;minimal-ui&quot; apology all of which is then reverted back in iOS 8?</i><p>I have no idea what you&#x27;re referring to here. Can you elaborate?<p>> <i>For that matter, sending group messages in apps is still horribly broken since iOS 7.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about here either. It works fine for me and everyone I know (and we use group messages a <i>lot</i>).<p>> <i>And iOS 8.1 was a disaster and was recalled quickly.</i><p>What are you talking about? Perhaps you&#x27;re referring to 8.0.1, which was replaced a day later by 8.0.2? The issue with 8.0.1 has not even the slightest shred of relation to design.",1415142538

These jobs can suck--these are the ones where you can end up working 100+ hour weeks on occasion, and 80+ hour weeks for months on end.  Ironically, I find these are also the places where people are most likely to &quot;look busy&quot; in an attempt to protect themselves.<p>Some companies overcommit on a short-term basis, but make an attempt to average 40 hours in the long term.  A lot better, and <i>way</i> less likely to burn people out, but still periods of suckiness.  But there&#x27;s a lot less need to look busy--and there will be periods of undertime, where people are just kind of dicking around.<p>The best job I ever had, the manager attempted to commit to 40 hours of work during peak times.  But during down times, instead of letting us idle, he had us actively work on infrastructure and self-improvement.  Build better tools, evaluate new tools, benchmark things, upgrade things, document things, etc.  He was good at making this productive, and not &quot;busy-work&quot; (which is the pitfall).  As time went on, these investments paid off, and we got faster and better and our 40 hours of work went a long way.  And as far as I can tell, nobody ever attempted to &quot;look busy&quot;, as the actual job was enjoyable.  Sadly, this could not last, and when the dotcom crash took us down the group was dissolved. :(",1415142307

301293,comment,300902,301266,0,0,axod,,,"I can see why CO2stats may be successful, phrases like ""purchases renewable energy to neutralize it, so your visitors feel good about staying longer."" are quite compelling for some people...<p>Ah this website uses a ton of power. CO2 is evil. CO2Stats ""neutralizes"" it so that it's all fine.<p>Wouldn't it be a better idea to help companies reduce their power usage, rather than ""buying renewable energy"" to offset it? Or encouraging them to install their own renewable energy sources.<p>If I murder 2 people, and offset it by having 2 children, is that fine? :/ (As long as I display a button on my T-Shirt saying I'm ""Person neutral"")?.<p>Given the wild inaccuracy of geo-ip lookups and the million other factors at play, I don't see any value in guessing at numbers here...",1221130607
301292,comment,300920,301188,0,0,shiro,,,"It may depend on your style.   I know some programmers who can just construct a complete function in their head during thinking.  For them, typing is just a mechanical step to dump the code into a computer.  You know, those who claim they can code with cat >foo.c.  If you're one of them, probably typing speed doesn't matter much, since it is not the major part of development.<p>I'm more like an oil-painter.  I have to put something on canvas to think.  Always typing small expressions into REPL to see where they take me.  Writing down a function from top of my head and see if it <i>looks</i> right---I mean, not only logically, but also whether it feels natural and straightforward on screen.  Emacs is an extension of my brain.  If I have to type slowly, it really gets in my way.  If some bad setting on driver or some slow connection to a remote machine puts a delay in the response of keypress, it drives me crazy.  I couldn't stand if my own fingers are the cause of the delay.<p>(BTW, the original article claims ""Slow-typist => Bad-programmer"".  Saying some fast-typist write bad code has nothing to do with the claim.  You have to show a good programmer who types slow to refute it.)",1221130311
301291,comment,300920,300920,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"i just realized that i may be a fast typist, but i use only 4 fingers. Left pinky for shift, ctrl,alt, left index for left letters, right middle finger for right letters, right thumb for space(sometimes left). I can type with a descent speed in two languages(English, Bulgarian) and i can even mix em and still type pretty fast. But i look at the keyboard pretty often and i my backspace key is the most clean one. This blog post has inspired me to just load KTouch and practice(KDE 4 came with a fast typing teacher, cool). I don't actually have a problem, because i make many mistakes, but i got really good at correcting them fast, so i still have a pretty good WPM count, haven't measured it, but its descent for a person who types a lot. I hope KTouch can help. After just 20 minutes with it i feel uncomfortable typing the way i used to, seems inefficient.",1221130058

Code reading is a skill that many developers skimp on.<p>I have NEVER liked this advice. Why? I've never found it the least bit helpful. Either I didn't understand the code or it sucked so much, I was too ill to work the rest of the day. Better: find something cool (on the outside) and figure out how to code it yourself. Ask for help or suggestions if you need it.</i><p>Your advice is bad.  Programming is like writing -- you get ideas from reading.  Did you learn to write by ""figuring things out"", or did you learn to write from imitating what you've read?<p>Personally, I think the #1 problem with programmers is that they are afraid to read other people's code.  They treat libraries like they are magic.  They aren't, they're just like the code that your app is written in.  Finally, if everyone else's code looks really different from yours, you are probably doing it wrong.<p><i>If you have time to blog, then your project isn't big enough. Code now, deploy, and blog later. Frankly, I don't want to read about your ""adventures in development"" until you're done and have something to say about your (completed) work.</i><p>But you have plenty of time to get 12000 karma here?",1221128863

Not exactly bootstrapping (though it sounds like they used to).<p>* Working late hours?  I highly doubt that's any different than any other group of business litigation lawyers.<p>* Agressive approach?  Again, it seems as if they are known as more aggressive since they only do litigation.<p>* T-shirts, jeans, Starbucks in the office?  Sure, that's a startup stereotype now.<p>I would argue that they're a highly focused firm that's a bit relaxed in their actual office environment, and a bit more collaborative than their peers.

I know it used to take me about 2-3 months between contracts or jobs before I got relaxed and hungry enough to want to dive back into really hard work.

It's amazing how much dexterity and foresight is needed to manage things when they're moving at such glacial pace, but timing is critical. An hour could mean the difference between eating next month or closing up shop.<p>2. Some items will succeed quickly, but only temporarily. You need to burn the kindling, but you also need some good wood. This is especially critical when you're in a service-based company. Your first few clients might bring you a lot of bacon, but the clients you build relationships buy you a pig farm.<p>3. You can't do it alone. Whether it's financial, technical, social, or moral support, you're going to need it eventually.<p>Overall, I think this list petered out a bit in the end, and some of the points missed the mark.

1634270,comment,1633892,1633892,0,0,adamt,,,"I've interviewed hundreds if not thousands of programmers over the past 15 years.  I am coming from the perspective of a UK based internet infrastructure/software startups of 1-100 people, much applies to other situations but there are some cultural differences over size of companies, geography etc.<p>CV/Resume Stage (getting an interview)<p>* In your CV/Resume be clear about what you've achieved.  What I look for is somebody who has achieved 'stuff'. Either in jobs, their education or their career. Try and display an ability to problem solve and make a difference.  It doesn't have to be massive achievements, but if you word it properly it can sound impressive, but don't exaggerate. For each job position talk about what you accomplished, were responsible for.  For your education, give a paragraph about your projects. Talk about stuff you've done in your spare time, taught yourself. As well as demonstrating what you've achieved it also helps steer an interview to stuff you will be strong about.<p>* If you struggle to talk about interesting things on your CV/Resume, then that is perhaps an issue. Write some code in your spare time, get involved with an open-source project etc.<p>* People form impressions within a few seconds of looking at your resume. Format and layout matters, but also make it easy for them to scan through it.  For HR people this does often mean some relevant tech buzzwords, but put yourself in the position of someone recruiting for the job you're looking for. What would give them confidence?<p>* Don't hide details. I personally like to see dates of jobs/education and grades. If you had a career brake or dropped out of college, don't hide it, think about how you can present in a positive manner.<p>* Find interesting companies and apply direct to them. This saves recruitment fees for the company, but it also shows you are interested in them. Write a short covering letter that is tailored to them, and (without being smarmy) make it clear why you are a good fit for them. Sell yourself.<p>Interview Stage<p>* Take your resume, and look at what obvious questions might come up. Work out what you can address in your resume, and what you would answer when asked. Be prepared to admit short-falls rather than bluff your way through them, but be prepared to spin them to your favour.<p>* Be prepared to deal with the standard generic interview questions ""where do you see yourselves in 5 years?"", ""what makes you enjoy your job?"", ""what do you like doing in your spare time?"". In most cases when asked this sort of question, the interviewer is just looking to get your talking to find out more about you.<p>* Ask intelligent questions.  This (if managed properly) helps the flow of the interview and allows the interviewer to feel in control. If you're tested on some technical thing and you don't know the answer, feel free to ask them 'if you don't mind could you just explain that to me?' rather than just shrinking into your seat feeling stupid when you don't know the question. An interviewer goes into the interview with 4-5 set questions in their mind, and if they spend 10 minutes explaining to an intelligent curious person the answer to one, they leave feeling good. If you just say ""sorry - i don't know"" and look sheepish, they move onto the next question, and mark you poorly on it.<p>* Get comfortable being put under pressure, explaining things on a whiteboard and coding whilst you talk.  One can imagine some brilliant programmers who might get agressive if challenged, or who are not used to explaining their thinking as they go along.<p>* Most technical interviews involve some technical questions. Some will be detailed specifics (in this language how do you that?) for these there is little prep you can do bar knowing it. For others, there may be more generic questions. A class Microsoft question used to be something like ""Why are manhole covers round?"".  Imagine an interviewer asking you that kind of question. If you just say ""I don't know"" and show no curiosity it won't reflect well. If you go into silence and think for 10 minutes it won't make a good interview.  Learn to enjoy the question rather than feel threatened by it. Learn to think allowed and articulate your thought processes. Ask gentle questions like 'am i thinking along the right lines here?'. These questions are more designed to test your problem solving and analytical skills. The third type of question is open questions like ""is garbage collection a good thing?"" or ""is agile the right approach to development"".  In this case the interviewer wants to have a balanced, rational, pragmatic opinion on the subject. Don't be shy with stating a view, but preface it with 'it obviously depends upon the specific application/product/requirement'.<p>* Understand the business of the company you are interviewing for. For example, if you're interviewing at Google for a product management role, expect to be asked questions like 'which search terms do you think think have the highest CPM rates?'. They don't want a perfect answer, they just want someone who can have an intelligent guess.<p>* Treat everybody you meet at the company with respect and confidence.  You never know who are the decision makers, and don't underestimate the importance of the receptionist, junior-HR person in having some influence.<p>* Make an effort. Turn up on time. Dress appropriately. Understand the company.<p>* Don't take rejection personally. People tend to recruit in their own image. There are some companies where they you won't be a good fit, and you won't come across right, or fit in. To some extent it's a numbers game.",1282772801

Basically, this formula says: when will 50% of the customers be left?<p>You can solve for t:<p>0.5 = (1-churn%)^t<p>ln (0.5) =ln(1 - churn%)^t<p>ln (0.5) =t x ln(1 - churn%)<p>t = ln (0.5) / ln (1 - churn%)<p>You can test this math by calculating how long t is for a churn of 50% (it's 1 month).<p>Using this math, the average tenure for a monthly churn of 1% would be 60 months. The average tenure is useful because you can then do a discounted cash flow analysis on 100% of the cash flows until time t, to calculate the lifetime value of the average customer. So in this case, you would be discounting 100% of 60 months of cash flows.<p>The average tenure goes down rapidly as you increase the churn rate. At 2% churn, the average tenure is 34 months. At 3%, it's 23 months. At 5%, it's 14 months. And at 10%, it's 7 months.<p>If you have enough data, you can use a non-constant churn rate as well, as churn rate definitely goes down over time.",1282772398

1634160,comment,1632629,1632934,0,0,joelhaus,,,"I joined a firm that owned and operated a portfolio of around 1,400 mixed-use units after college. The firm was small and so I was able to get involved in almost every aspect of the business. In addition, I'm currently getting a M.S. in Real Estate. I suspect our firm had better success because we had skin in the game. Personally, I would have difficulty handing over those responsibilities to someone without a long term financial stake.<p>Conversations about real estate investment are so localized and situation specific, it's difficult to make generalizations, but I'll try making a few anyway:<p>1) <i>Motives </i> - consider carefully when drawing up a contract what financial incentives are being created for your manager. Our top priority was always filling vacancies, but as an owner, your sign-off should be always be required before a new tenant is approved[1].<p>2) <i>Kickbacks</i> - if you expect your manager to handle hiring of contractors, he <i>will</i> be offered money to award the contract. You will also need contractors more often than you think. When a tenant moves out, you'll either renovate or at the very least, re-paint their apartment... depending on the local rental market, this can be the difference between a one month and a six month vacancy. The smaller the property, the more important it is to get apartments rented quickly.<p>3) <i>Repairs</i> - if something can go wrong, it usually will go wrong. Appliances, doors and other fixtures will break, capital improvements will get pushed ahead in your schedule and tenants will misbehave, sometimes even breaking the law and requiring the police to get involved. When you see a property with a high cap rate, expect more of these issues[2].<p>4) <i>Emergencies</i> - if you don't live very close by, you should have someone on staff that does or, even better, have someone on payroll that lives on-site.<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg, feel free to get ask any questions.<p>[1] Personally, I would also want to deposit all rent checks myself and sign off before any invoices were paid.<p>[2] Another ""high cap rate"" problem you'll be faced with is landlord-tenant court. These properties tend to just have more 'problem' tenants.<p><pre><code>  P.S. Some last thoughts for investors:

  a) *You make your money when you buy.*

  Putting all your eggs in the appreciation basket is risky; 
  if the cashflows are there, many of the above issues won't 
  be keeping you up at night.

  b) *If your strategy is to hold for less than five years, 
  your management time just increased 10x.*

  Commercial real estate loans generally have a balloon 
  payment after 5, 7 or 10 years. You'll need to roll your 
  loan over at this point and any equity built up above the 
  lenders required loan to value (c. 65% these days) can be 
  extracted. Don't put yourself or your investors in a 
  position where you are forced to sell at a loss. 
  Credibility in this field is hard to gain, but easy to lose.

Android is free for anyone to use, but if you want the Market and the Google branded Apps, you have to go through a round of certification. The process is testing for compatibility, among other things.<p>(This is the reason we keep seeing cheap Android tablets pop up without the Market application installed - they haven't gone through the process.)<p>Most carrier/OEM customization of Android is at the UI level. As a developer, it's understandable to not have all the different devices with different capabilities, but if you code as recommended and don't make assumptions about what the user has / doesn't have available, your application will work pretty much anywhere that the Market is installed.<p>Null Pointer Exceptions don't happen because the phone's OEM or carrier changed something - they happen because the code went ahead and assumed something worked correctly that did not.<p>(NPEs are the most common reason I've personally seen applications crash on my own devices, I have no data to support an assertion that that is the main cause of Force Closes, however)",1282770167

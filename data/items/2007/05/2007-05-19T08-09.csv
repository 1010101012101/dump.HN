Unfortunately, the site is unusably slow and the man living in range of the paintball gun is nowhere to be found.<p>The disturbing thing here is that I really wish I could actually shoot this moron with a paintball gun over the internet. Now, I don't know what art is but I really doubt this guy is getting enough donations to make this thing worthwhile. He exposed himself willingly to the sum ignorance of humanity.

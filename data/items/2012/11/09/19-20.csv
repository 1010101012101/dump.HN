Of course in an academic research center, no one makes any money and prestige is reserved for grant-winners and first authors in Nature.<p>Publications would be hard as a non-PhD.  If you wanted to focus on that, I have found that PIs welcome outsiders into their research groups.  I'm certain you could put yourself in a position to publish with the same amount of credit as a grad student on a team (not much?).  Especially with good data hacking skills, someone will be willing to help you scratch that publication itch.  I think it would be like having a major side-project in addition to a fulltime job though.<p>Oddly enough, even though the work I do here is less technical than what I have done in the private sector, I seem to perceive a slight up-tick in respect from enterprise software groups.",1352491103

The argument went that if your biggest customer is only worth $200/month, it prevents you from getting confused about who you work for. If Coke paid 37signals $2,000,000 a month for Basecamp, it would turn into Cokecamp. When Coke takes their business elsewhere they'd be stuck with a weird product highly customized to Coke which nobody else wants.

I see and acknowledge the power they can wield in the right hands, but for mere mortals it's a terrible experience.</i><p>You've asked the question and answered it yourself ;-)<p>Using a GUI over the CLI is probably preferred for 90% of the tasks 95% of the users typically perform. I don't agree with all the drawbacks you listed, but I can see where they are coming from. The CLI is simply not so great for typical computer users.<p>That said, a good CLI is absolutely invaluable for power users, system adminstrators, developers, etc. There's only so much you can conveniently do through a GUI, as soon as you need to compose multiple complex actions into a script or perform advanced data extraction, search operations, automate tasks, etc. there really is no alternative for a good CLI.<p>The funny thing about a powerful CLI is that it isn't very accessible unless you invest quite a bit of time mastering it, but once you do, you'll find out that you can do many (most?) things more efficiently by typing up commands and composing them into scripts. Once you get proficient using the CLI, you'll find yourself using the CLI for all kinds of things you used to do through a GUI before. For example selecting and copying around files or extracting archives, personally I think CLI tools (in my case unix CLI tools) to be much more flexible and convenient than something like WinZip.<p>But just like most people will never use their computer to write scripts or computer programs, they will also never invest time in learning the CLI. And usually they don't really need to anyway, just like most people don't need (or want) to learn how to change the oil on their car themselves, no matter how easy it is if you know how to do it. It's not something they enjoy learning about, but that doesn't mean changing oil is useless or difficult.<p>The lack of a proper CLI in Windows 9x and XP has always bothered me a great deal, as a developer and power user. It was one of the main reasons to switch to Linux and later OS X. Apparently these days Windows has a pretty good CLI with PowerShell, but the Windows train has already departed a long time ago for me. But it's still a good thing Microsoft finally decided they had to provide power tools like a CLI, it's one reason less blocking me from every going back to Windows (a lot of others still remain though ;-)",1352489280

Kant's categorical imperative.  The harm principle.  It's all about how you affect other people -- you shouldn't do them harm, and perhaps on a good day, you should do them good.  Beyond that, who cares?<p>This isn't a Christian way of thinking, though.  To a Christian, the object of central importance is God.  How he views things.  How your actions show your love for him.  The pursuit of righteousness, for its own sake, because it is important to Him.<p>This is not just my opinion, by the way.  A central prayer in Judaism is the Shema (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael</a>): ""Hear, O Israel: the LORD is our God, the LORD is one,"".  And Jesus affirms this as the central and most important command, and expands it (Mk 12:19):<p><pre><code>    ""The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; \n    The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the \n    Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, \n    and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this \n    is the first commandment."" \n</code></pre>\nThe <i>central</i> commands of both religions don't say a thing about other people.<p>There are a lot of external, moral things we agree upon.  But consider, for a moment, even the most famous set of rules, the ten commandments:<p><pre><code>    1. You shall have no other Gods \n    2. You shall make no artwork to be used as an idol\n    3. You shall not misuse God's name\n    4. You shall rest on the seventh day\n    5. Honor your father and mother\n    6. You shall not murder\n    7. You shall not commit adultery\n    8. You shall not steal\n    9. You shall not give false legal testimony\n   10. You shall not be jealous of your neighbor's things\n</code></pre>\nThink about those for a second.  The secularist is right there with us on 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Those are external, measurable, harm-related.  But look at the rest of them!  1, 5 and 10 are purely internal; thought crimes, if you will.  2 and 3 are purely religious -- who are you hurting exactly if you break these? -- and 4 sounds like a good idea, but making it a commandment that bears the death penalty seems rather like overkill.<p>Is it that Christians are dumb for thinking these are important?  No, it's that we <i>think about ethics differently than you</i>. To suppose Christianity approaches ethics like a secularist is to seriously misunderstand Christianity, and to project your own way of thinking onto it.",1352489113

Hess is updating info every 2 hours.<p>Other apps for this problem are: \nhttp://www.gasbuddy.com/sandy/Default.aspx\nhttp://mappler.net/gasstation/<p>If anyone knows the sources of retail fuel inventory data, we can process and make them available in our app today. I googled government and gas companies sites and came empty handed (except for Hess of course).<p>Please help.\nP.S. any feedback on the app is appreciated.",1352487961

Often, they glorify suffering itself.<p><i>>> If two people consent to engage parts of their bodies in various ways, that doesnt seem to raise any ethical issues of its own.</i><p>Sex in modern Western society is wholly different than how it was thousands of years ago. Today we are radically more educated about the workings and consequences of sex, we have access to condoms and numerous other forms of birth control, and we are dramatically less likely to act violently as a result of sexual impulses and emotions. In addition, having a child is more of a personal lifestyle choice, rather than being a decision that affects the entire tribe or community.",1352487941

For IE < 9, generally it was pretty easy, though we had to do a few extra things we needed to work around:<p>1. remove the use of SVG groups which are not supported in VML (though I think r2d3 has had a recent update with some level of group support) \n2. Avoid selecting features paths by class (e.g. us d3.select('path') instead of d3.select('path.state') Class selectors just wouldn't work for us.\n3. for performance, we used only the most simplified geographic data in IE < 9 4) \n4.

Given that there were 37k 'Project ORCA' volunteers in swing states, the author estimates that if each had brought only 20 additional voters to the polls the election could have gone to Romney.<p>Now, I think this is rather unlikely, and reminiscent of the 'Bargaining' stage in the Kubler-Ross model of the grieving process; polls last weekend in critical states like OH and FL showed strong support for Democratic senate candidates and >70% support for Obama's handling of Hurricane Sandy, and the poll momentum was already headed Obama's way. Likewise, Republican voters who can't stand the President were highly motivated to go out and vote against him anyway and likely did so with or without a phone call - indeed, I heard from some Romney supporters that the campaign relied far too heavily on robo-calling in the leadup to the election, to the point that they were sick of getting reminders.<p>But having 37k field volunteers confused and dispirited on election day is still a disaster. It's very ironic that a campaign that was nominally against 'trickle down government' was run in such a centralized, dictatorial fashion. Psychologically, it seems like a classic case of projection - unconsciously ascribing one's own personality traits to other people in one's life. Romney's reported preference for abundant data and tight control robbed tens of thousands of his most enthusiastic supporters of their autonomy and initiative.",1352487867

The point of making things like sex, gluttony, etc taboo is that it's a pleasure that you're putting above God that detracts from the worship of him. In many western societies people tend to think ""victimless crimes"" are of no consequence. I'd also like to point out that you seem to be working off the assumption that there is no God. If in fact you were operating under the assumption that there is in fact a God or deity, etc. simply this higher order being commanding it is enough to follow his word.<p>I would also say that on a personal (non-religious) note, I (and many others) consider sex a highly personal and special act that becomes less so the more people it's done with. Valuing modesty isn't such a bad thing, and I believe that being select about who you have sex with makes it more valuable of a gift to share with someone.",1352487865

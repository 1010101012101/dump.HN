It&#x27;s entirely possible that there is a company out there looking for a junior web developer, so don&#x27;t discount that possibility.<p>Secondly, try to find some more experienced web developers to advise/mentor you. Where are you located? There may be an appropriate location (e.g. Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, the Noisebridge Hackspace in San Francisco) or a meetup (check meetup.com for Meetups aimed at Ruby, JS or web developers in your vicinity). Having someone who can advise you face-to-face will be better than relying purely on our advice here on HN, and there&#x27;s the possibility that they&#x27;ll be able to point you in the direction of potential clients/employers.<p>Thirdly, think about what sort of work you want, then create a showcase web site/app to demonstrate the fact that you have the skills necessary to do that work. Put all the source code on Git so people can review it if they want to, then approach potential employers and clients with the following approach:<p>Potential employers: &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m a self-taught programmer. I&#x27;m looking for an opportunity to use my Ruby/JS/web skills. Here&#x27;s an example of the sort of work I can do. Could I come in to meet with you to discuss whether there might be a position for me with your company?&quot;<p>Potential clients: &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m a freelance website designers. I think I could design a great website for your business. Here&#x27;s an example of the kind of work I can do. Could we arrange a meeting to discuss?&quot;<p>Fourthly, expand your skillset by learning how to do more stuff that will improve your chances of getting hired. For example, if you don&#x27;t know anything about databases, then learn how to set up MySQL and use it to store data as part of a webapp.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t worry. All web developers were self-taught until comparatively recently. There&#x27;s plenty of scope for a young, enthusiastic, self-taught developer to build a career without having finished school!<p>Feel free to contact me directly (e.g. via <a href""http://jackgavigan.com/contact"" rel""nofollo"">http://jackgavigan.com/contact/</a>) if you&#x27;d like to discuss your situation in more details without posting personal information publicly.",1389628787

Encoding requires making choices about what to throw away, but decoding is just putting them back together.  Mathematically you can think about encoding as converting to some matrix representation that has a lot of zeros -- the process to take that matrix and reconstruct the image doesn&#x27;t depend on how many zeros there are, but the efficiency of the encoder does.<p>Perhaps an easier way to think about it from a programmer perspective.. a decoder is a programming language interpreter that takes a program and generates the data.  The encoder is something that generates a program in that language.  So you can see that the decoder is quite straight-forward, while the encoder has a lot of choices to make about how best to represent the data as a program in the decoder&#x27;s language.",1389628434

The key difference is that I know cryptozoology is largely pseudoscience whereas I merely suspect it in the case of anthrozoology. At least the word, &quot;cryptozoology,&quot; is a reasonable description of what they are trying to do: the study of hidden animals. Anthrozoologoy translates roughly as man animal study, a term pregnant with meaninglessness. So, let&#x27;s see what Wikipedia has to say about anthrozoology:<p>&quot;Anthrozoology . . . is the study of interaction between living things.&quot;<p>Hey, I have friends who work in that field. They call themselves . . . &quot;ecologists.&quot; Or, if you want to limit it to the types of interactions in the article, &quot;animal behaviourists.&quot; They might even say that they work on &quot;inter-species communication.&quot; So, I apologise for being dismissive of a term I have never heard before used in a context where there are other widely used terms that would seemingly be appropriate.<p>And to any genuine scientists out there studying human animal interactions, I genuinely apologise for my snark. It is unfortunate that my first encounter with the field of &quot;anthrozoology&quot; has been tainted by the inane nonsense in this article. That said, I don&#x27;t think human-animal interactions have been nearly as neglected as the wikipedia article implies.",1389628239

I finally accepted that there are losses in this world that can never be reversed. If there&#x27;s something on the other side, then I look forward to seeing it. Joining the 120 billion people who have already died can&#x27;t be the worst thing. If there&#x27;s nothing on the other side, and death is the end of existence, then there&#x27;s nothing to fear in it. I know this is an unpopular opinion here, but a total end seems unlikely. I don&#x27;t believe in religion or gods in the anthropomorphic sense of &quot;god&quot; but whatever causes brought me to exist in a world can occur again.<p>As with religion, this <i>idea</i> of a perfect future (heaven?) in the Singularity can become a dangerous distraction from the real problem. It&#x27;s not death that is a hard problem. It&#x27;s life. Economic scarcity is the real enemy. That is what we should be fighting with all our force. We should fight first to make life better, and second to prolong it.<p>If we &quot;solve death&quot; and still have to live with scarcity and inequality, then we&#x27;ve just failed in a way that lasts much longer.<p>(On practical grounds, of course, I&#x27;m all for life-saving medical advances and research that reduces or eliminates costly illnesses. In fact, if rejuvenation were an option, I&#x27;d probably take it. I&#x27;m OK with death, but I hate getting sick. My point is that the <i>real</i> purpose of technology should be to kill <i>scarcity</i> first, and then aim for immortality second.)<p>Ok, done ranting.",1389628172

I for instance, got my first computer around 15 and had to learn how to drag a mouse around a screen, touch type, and use the internet.<p>What you need to realize is while you also need technical skill, when you&#x27;re starting out, that&#x27;s really not the most important thing. Very quickly you will learn that many people are looking down on you or see you as an incredibly cheap deal. You&#x27;re a dropout, and it may sound crude, but no one cares about your life or your problems. They really don&#x27;t. They probably think you&#x27;re some lazy kid who is money hungry. But it doesn&#x27;t matter. Most of these people will NEVER hire you. And that&#x27;s okay; ignore them. Many people still need the skills you have, no matter how refined those skills may be. Now you have 2 main barriers to getting them to pay you.<p>1. How do these people find you? Do they type into &quot;the Google&quot; and find your beautiful portfolio and contact you? At this point, perhaps not. Perhaps you need (shocking, I know), to get off the internet and meet them before they even do that.<p>2. Can you solve their problem? You may not have a portfolio, and it wouldn&#x27;t matter, except how do they know whether you can solve their problem? I don&#x27;t care how you accomplish this, but that&#x27;s all really all they want to know. You&#x27;d be surprised how a simply/ugly static HTML page can blow the mind of certain people. Many do not even know what they need to be able to hire someone online to do it for them. Just using email is enough of a hurdle.<p>Some information about myself. I got my first computer around 15 years old, learned to use it, and was interested in web development, so by 16 I was doing simple websites in PHP/HTML/CSS along with small bits of copy/paste Javascript. I moonlighted during high school (at which time my poor family got sued for no legitimate reason), paid off a lawsuit, and started 2 small side businesses.<p>One was a private server for a small online game. A small online game you say? What does that have anything to do with web dev? It doesn&#x27;t, I enjoyed the game and did it. But it did help me immensely with not ending up on the streets, I used my web dev skills to improve it and built a community around it, and made a bit of money. Most importantly, I met many people who could later act as testimonials to their friends and family of my web development skills. Most of this stuff happened the same time I was refining my technical skills.<p>The second venture was started because of one of the players on the server. He referred his friend to me who had a business idea but was unable to execute without programming knowledge. We built 2 large online communities and made a portion of a million dollars in advertisements and sponsorships. This later allowed me to officially start the freelance business I have now (I just turned 21). Which allowed me to secure multiple full-time offers at reputable companies despite my (lack of) credentials, speak at some local events, and charge significantly more (aka bring more value) than I ever imagined I would back at 15.<p>Enough about me, let&#x27;s get back to you. At this point, the biggest skill you need to learn is not technical, it&#x27;s learning how to influence, persuade, and prove to potential clients that you can do the job. I have to get going so I&#x27;m going to stop here, but you most definitely have everything you need to be successful as a freelancer, don&#x27;t let anyone tell you you don&#x27;t.<p>But it takes a heck of a lot of determination and hard work.<p>P.S: If you&#x27;re really unable to find your first client, I do have a small project making doing some front-end work for a website. Very simple HTML/CSS/JS stuff that I was planning to give off to a friend to learn. But please, do everything and anything you can to find that first client yourself. It will help you a lot more in the long run than people on HN feeding you projects. Good luck!",1389627518

It so happens that our current level of computing was possible with the amount of effort put in, but I don&#x27;t think it was possible to predict that the amount of effort that could be devoted could produce the results we have, in the 1970s.

Is the `arguments` implicit variable being passed in some place? (EDIT: yes, via `Function.caller`.) Are the argument values accessed through the result of calling `Args`?<p>For a non-macro implementation of this, it might be interesting to use function decorator syntax instead, to put the argument processing <i>outside</i> the function body entirely. Basically, the argument processor decorator function would take an options array and a target function, which has all possible parameters, explicitly named. The decorator would spit out a new function that invisibly does all of the wrangling of `arguments` and then finally calls the target function. An advantage is that I think this would be the most minimal pure JS solution from a syntax perspective, and it would keep the actual function body uncluttered. A disadvantage is that it could only really be used with function expressions (not declarations).",1389627414

7051010,comment,7049668,7050295,2,0,oleganza,,,"Investing in BTC as a collectible unit <i>is</i> a huge speculation, I have no doubt about it. No matter how other Bitcoin supporters talk about &quot;such a useful ledger&quot;, there&#x27;s no way to deduce how much all BTC <i>units</i> should be worth. Bitcoin-as-network is as good at $10/BTC as at $1000000/BTC. You still can cheaply move dollars across the globe, or timestamp your contracts, or whatever.<p>The productive discussion would be about what is the basis of that speculation, or whether it can be equally huge with any other asset like a tulip bulb or dotcom stock.<p>I&#x27;d argue, Bitcoin is unique in a sense that it can (already does) easily act as money itself. People were investing in tulip bulbs, ponzi and dotcom stocks in order to <i>cash out</i> big way. Current stock market is no different. There&#x27;s a lot of &quot;bad&quot; money pumped by Fed and from pension programs and no theoretical sustainability while all fundamentals say it&#x27;s going to crash hard.<p>On contrary, Bitcoin is a risky long-run bet that it will be useful as a world money, so there would not be any need to &quot;cash out&quot; into some single asset at the &quot;maximum&quot; price. If Bitcoin succeeds, then there&#x27;d be no need for dollars, euros, yen, gold and silver. You&#x27;d be calmly selling portions of your BTC to buy food, travel, shelter and invest in business.<p>Some portion of investors bets on that exact outcome. Those who bet on short-term price increases to &quot;cash out&quot; produce that pyramid-looking effect (huge bubble and then huge price drop), but every time there are more and more long-term investors. This time BTC went from $140 to $1200 and quickly crashed to $500 (then, getting back to $800-900). Clearly, everyone who wanted to cash out already did and what&#x27;s left are those holder who are not selling for some time now. When BTC goes to $5-10K this year, then they might sell a portion of holdings to newcomers, but keep the rest for a really long time. If everyone continues to follow the same logic, this &quot;pyramid&quot; will lead to a situation when almost everyone has some BTC, everyone values BTC a lot and everyone is ready to trade this BTC between each other for whatever goods and services they desire.<p>Right now, most investors in Bitcoin are economically disconnected (do not trade directly with each other), so you don&#x27;t see much transactions. Bitcoin is used like gold: a speculative &quot;store of wealth&quot;. But at some point the density of investors will become so big, that more and more direct economic relations will appear between them. Tomorrow you might find that your local baker is BTC investor and you can pay him in BTC. Later he will discover that his supplier also invested in BTC and thus will be able to accept even more BTC and pay his bills directly with BTC. As this second phase (increased trade bypassing fiat currency) progresses, people will see how Bitcoin is no longer just &quot;gold 2.0&quot;, but actual <i>money</i>. More and more will invest in it and thus become payers and payees in BTC. As this goes on, reservation demand for USD will start to go down quite noticeably and people will rush to BTC even faster (as prices in USD grow quicker and quicker). Ultimately, USD will hyperinflate and become worthless. All tax collectors will go looking for another job (they want to be paid in BTC, but government can&#x27;t just print it or buy it). In the end, inflation and taxation will become impossible. Police will have to be sponsored voluntarily on district-by-district basis. Armies will abandon their bases and poor islamic nations being raped for decades will be paid a handsome retribution as an anti-terrorist protection measure by the wealthy Bitcoin holders in U.S. Bitcoiners outside the U.S. and U.K. would not need to worry about being blown up that much, yet still will contribute greatly to protection of whatever cities/countries they reside in.",1389626417

There&#x27;s only two options there: import power from another time zone where the sun shines, or store the energy during the day.<p>The first is very lossy: HVDC is the most efficient way to transport bulk electricity, and it loses 3.5% per 1000km. You would need to transport electricity about half the way around the earth of the earth&#x27;s circumference, or about 20,000km, meaning you would lose about 50% in transit. So this would depend on a drastically more efficient way of transporting power (superconducting power lines?).<p>The second is not possible with current battery technology.<p>And that still doesn&#x27;t answer why this arrangement would be better than a nuclear (base load) + solar (daytime variable load) + natural gas (nighttime/cloudy conditions variable load) mix.",1389626397

I have written a fair bit on my HN account about freelancing/consulting but feel free to contact me.<p>The main thing I wish I knew at your age was the difference (and progression) between the stages of freelancing, contracting, consulting and beyond.<p>I&#x27;ve helped several of my friends start their own freelancing businesses who are full time now, I&#x27;ll echo what&#x27;s been said many times on HN:<p>It&#x27;s not what your education makes of you, but what you make of your education.<p>With the below, you can embark on a path of adding value to the world with your skills in a disciplined way to find long term clients whom you can help grow, and you can grow yourself.<p>The below only has value if it&#x27;s contemplated, practiced, and reflected upon regularly.  You&#x27;ll find other things to add to the list but I think the list below is my first principles list of being successful, freelancing or employed.<p>The below, also, is how I approach anyone, and it turns into leads and work on it&#x27;s own.<p>By remaining genuinely curious, thoughtful, and interested in how people are solving their problems (including excel sheets, access databases, or doing it manually), customers are validating the need for software in their lives and you need only pay attention and support them along.<p>I&#x27;ll share with you the business model I was given at 18:<p>Find 10 customers who are willing to pay you $1000 a month for basic app support or development.  If they won&#x27;t spend $500-1000 a month making their business better, they&#x27;re not a customer, but someone who wants to hire a free student. I was able to start in this way in the late 90&#x27;s to 2001, and had a foundation from which to explore, maybe do more work in one place than another. Today, everyone&#x27;s online and expects for software to exist for them. The key here is many places that can&#x27;t hire a full time developer or person can probably afford a part time one who creates value for them.<p>Things that I wish I understood deeply much sooner:<p>Solving B2B problems solves the cash flow issue: Businesses that make money every month have money to spend.  Getting people to spend their own money can be quite different.<p>Discipline: This will decide how our lives will go. It is the single most important master skill. The more we work at developing and keeping discipline in more and more areas of your life, the more successful we are.<p>Self-educate: The fact that you can self-educate is the single biggest skill that is needed in terms of your technical ability.  This means learning things that weren&#x27;t in my core, but rather becoming an extremely strong problem solver, which made me attract lots of interesting (and paying) problems to solve for which there might not be a lot of solutions.<p>Nothing gets easier: You just get better, if you want to.<p>Self-directed: Contemplate this phrase -- you&#x27;ll be self-directing and self-educating for a long time, and it&#x27;s the best journey you can imagine to get to know yourself in the midst of any uncertainty.<p>Date before you get married:  You&#x27;ll be hired in the beginning by people who will be taking a chance on you or simply like you because you&#x27;re young, ambitious and have a positive attitude.  So, do fixed fee projects for $1-3000 that cover risk for both you and the end user, even if you have to break down a big project into small $1-3K phases.  This is a huge trust building technique with customers.<p>Value: This is the word I had to learn when I was 18.  If I couldn&#x27;t generate more value than what I was paid, I wasn&#x27;t rehired.  Value is saving or making a customer time or money. So I learned to find and be good at what was valuable to a customer, that I could do.  What you&#x27;re selling is helping the customer add value to their company in a way they can measure and is meaningful to them, which you can do for them.<p>Networking: This word looks like it&#x27;s foreign sometimes.  My networking is simple, before receiving, there must be giving.  Help, help, help, share, share, share.  You&#x27;re not just out for a quick hit contract, but any long term ones you can find that are meaningful for both parties.<p>Track Record: Your education, and experience are second to the track record of solving problems you can build up.  I spent 10 years working in as many industries as I ended up in, sometimes at the same time because I liked the variety.  I aimed to get 20 years of work experience in 10 years of living.  Now, on the flip side, I have more experience than what I know what to do with and it helps me understand anything I face more and more, it&#x27;s the best snowball effect.<p>Attitude: I know we like to do things that interest us.  If you can find helping improve the quality of others lives greatly by using a tiny bit of your skill and writing the software they need, for example, never saying no, and saying &quot;let me think about it&quot;, those 5 words have gotten me more work, introductions and opportunities than anything.<p>Problem based thinking: Never, ever think solution first.  Learn the problem and know the data better than anyone else before writing a single line of code.<p>You&#x27;re not alone: I went through starting a freelancing life largely alone and endured a good 5-7 years of doubters and supporters.  It&#x27;s good you&#x27;re putting yourself out there, and that there&#x27;s a place like HN to put yourself out there.<p>Don&#x27;t let others self-doubt infiltrate your mindset.  Creativity and innovation happen in a mindset of possibility, not shooting ourselves down or letting others.",1389626181

Right now, the only credible competitor to Windows for a user-facing business PC operating system is OS X, and even then a lot more of the serious business software is better on Windows today so Apple&#x27;s penetration seems to be mainly laptops for management and sales roles.<p>There are plenty of ways Microsoft could develop Windows that would play to their existing customer base and their established strengths; I&#x27;ve argued at length in previous posts that Microsoft are the best positioned business in the world to push a &quot;private cloud&quot; trend, for one possible example, and that they could offer genuine benefits to businesses that would justify upgrading their installations. All they have to do is regain the focus they had a few years ago and play the cards they&#x27;ve been dealt to best effect, and as far as desktop Windows goes, I believe that means not rocking the boat trying to be too clever and &quot;consumery&quot;, but instead building out the technical strengths under the hood and making them easy and familiar to access.<p>But if their next desktop OS is another turkey, I suspect their luck will start to run out. It will take them several years to even try a different strategy, and by then I expect at least one major competing platform will have reached enough maturity to take them head on and start stealing away the big business software market. Apple could do it -- they have the technical smarts, the war chest, and the scale to pull it off -- but I don&#x27;t think they will under their current management team. I suspect a more direct challenge might come from a start-up with a big name backer building something on Linux. While &quot;year of Linux on the desktop&quot; is still a running joke, the likes of Android phones/tablets, Chromebooks, and probably soon Steam Machines show it can work as a non-geek&#x27;s OS given the right front-end.

The primary way is finding a business owner and convincing them that you can build them something which will make them money.  Having something you have made which you can demonstrate is of benefit (and as sibling comments have mentioned, you should probably get <i>something</i> which you&#x27;ve made into a showable state ASAP), but mostly, it&#x27;s about being able to sell yourself convincingly to people who, primarily, could not tell you that Baker&#x27;s Yeast is not a well-known Javascript framework for building web pages out of REST-over-XML transport engines.<p>Also, don&#x27;t sell yourself short with regards to getting jobs.  While you likely can&#x27;t get hired at a Bank of America or what have you, if you approach a local e.g. Rails consultancy, not having an Education section on your resume will probably not be a total disqualifier.  Many people don&#x27;t.  You will probably be able to pass a FizzBuzz test, which actually makes you substantially better than many people with Bachelors of Science in CS in the hiring pool.  I think a standard W-2 job -- heck, pitch them on an internship and just upgrade after showing you can do the work -- is likely a better fit given that you do not have the connections/experience likely to fill a freelancing pipeline at the moment.  You can always revisit that decision when you&#x27;re 20, at which point your high school career will never come up at a job interview that you&#x27;d actually want to pass.",1389625438

6617799,comment,6617551,6617551,5,0,drugcite-com,,,"An easy way to enter the name of a specific drug or side effect to see its effects as reported to the FDA. One of the primary ways that the United States Food and Drug Administration monitors the safety of marketed drugs is the collection and analysis of reported adverse events (an event that was not the intended outcome of the prescribed drug and has a negative impact on health) through the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS). These reports are submitted by physicians, healthcare consumers, lawyers amongst others, and then the FDA scientific staff will assess these events in the context of other databases to determine if a particular safety concern is associated, and possibly caused by, exposure to a particular drug. Since this is a public database and useful to prescribers and patients alike to know if &quot;has what I&#x27;m experiencing been described in patients taking this drug before?&quot; DrugCite has created a more friendly interface to answer that question. The data can also be sorted by Age and Gender in most cases giving a more detailed view.<p><a href=""http://www.drugcite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugcite.com/</a><p>We use several data sets including FAERS, Meddra, Medical Device Data, UMLS/RXNORM and DAILYMED/Structured Product Labels to name a few.",1382802993

Cars attempting to enter the road which arent self-driving, or too old of a version, would not be able to pass the tollbooth, and will be fined for attempting to and wasting everyone&#x27;s time at one of the booths.<p>2) Parking tickets and metermaids should go the way of the dodo. Cars can easily be detected at the side of a curb, and the money deducted from the EZPass or whatever account.

The shorter the period the worse off you are. I can&#x27;t be sure, but I think you have a predictable, short period.<p>Even more interesting, read up on RC4: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4</a> -- there were small but detectable biases in the initial part of the key stream, which allowed an attacker to break the algorithm. The solution was to advance the key stream a bit to discard the initial, biased part.<p>And thus we get to the hardest part of cryptographic algorithm design and why these exercises are so hard. It is very easy for someone to build an algorithm they can&#x27;t break themselves. Obviously, you did everything you knew how to do to prevent it from being broken. It might even take an experienced cryptographer a while to break it (the key stream bias in RC4 was not found for a long time). Check out some of the WEP attacks.<p>Another thought for you: <a href=""http://www.rickwash.org/papers/stream.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rickwash.org/papers/stream.pdf</a> -- just how easy it is to be wrong. Page 8: If the swap operation of RC4 is omitted, the keystream becomes cyclic with a period of 2\nn+1 -- very small changes can introduce non-obvious periods, etc.<p>Final thought: check out how WEP got broken. Stream ciphers are hard. This is why it is often very good as an educational exercise to write your own ciphers (I have done it), but you sort of do it once and either decide to get good at it or realize it takes a LOT of knowledge and it is better to just know the attacks and not invest a lot of time in it.<p>Anyhow, hope you had fun with this. Read up on the various ways stream cipher design can be broken, and check out how AES can be used as a stream cipher. Not sure I had a point, precisely, just wanted to share some thoughts having seen a dozen or more of these crazy algorithms in use in live code meant to protect truly sensitive data. Some programmer always thinks he is clever and ends up creating some XOR cipher (I know that is not you as you have the right goals, in my mind, for doing this).",1382801794

I imagine this will have all sorts of weird effects on people&#x27;s habits. Right now you spend the price of a car upgrade every few years, taxes & insurance once a year and petrol every week or two. You don&#x27;t really feel the cost of a supermarket trip. If you drive your niece to the airport, you don&#x27;t think about the cost at all. A drive to the woods with your family counts as free even if you use 20 worth of petrol and 20 in depreciation.<p>Governments might be more inclined to get the full cost of roads from transport companies one step removed from the public than directly from them.<p>The effects of a new mode of transport are hard to predict.

That would reduce the unsightly clutter on so many American streets, colloquially known as &quot;parked cars&quot; and alleviate congestion on city streets, much of which comes from cars circling around the block &quot;looking for a spot to park&quot;.<p>Sure, it would cut into the revenues of parking lots and car manufacturers. But IMHO no one has done more to pollute the environment than the latter. The number of people on the planet has increased and - even as Europe cuta down on its car population thanks to the high price of petrol - we US folk continue to purchase our gas guzzlers and have a car culture in many cities. Some like LA are perpetually covered in smog, so we can see the effects of this car culture.<p>Thankfully, after decades of polluting the environment for our individual joyrides, things are changing - the younger generation isn&#x27;t into owning cars as much, and self drivi g cars are on the way. An unfortunate victim of this trend will be the venerable macho tradition of the man picking the lady up in his OWN shiny ride, which he drives. Now it will be about renting the car for the occasion, and both occupants can interact with each other while the car is in motion.<p>In short:<p><pre><code>  Less pollution\n  Less congestion\n  Less wasting time looking for parking\n  More equality between sexes in terms of driving\n  Less unsightly clutter on streets\n  Less revenues from car manufacturers from producing CARS,\n  so they can focus on recurring revenues (eg renting stuff\n  inside their fleet)\n</code></pre>\nHopefully this will lead to a more sustainable form of transportation.",1382800314

They might as well be tieing and untieing knots on a piece of string, leading an existence depending on the generosity of others. I am not sure if there is a better definition for 'society would be better off without them', even if this is hidden from them. I am all for finding useful tasks a human of IQ 80 (whatever that means) can accomplish, but withholding progress and providing a fraudulent sense of accomplishment does not strike me as the most respectful approach one can take towards solving this problem.",1226267598

But even so, could you imagine what it would do to the startup community if you required every company regardless of size to offer its employees health insurance?  I don't think that Palo Alto would end up looking anything like it does now.  There are risks involved in launching a startup the first few years.  Everyone knows this.  But, with the risks come proportionate rewards, which brings us to:<p>> Instead, he gets spooked that he might have to give more of his precious precious money away.<p>You have it backwards.  It's been said a lot recently that the ""hard working middle class middle americans"" are the foundation of our country; actually, the entrepreneurs and business leaders who end up making tons of money are the foundation of our country.  Without them, no one else would have jobs.  You can offer as much welfare or unemployment benefits as you want, but the people you really need happy are the founders of the world.  If you make it totally unprofitable or fail to recognize the risks inherent in going out on a limb with no safety net to offer a service to others, we'll either stop (well, slow down or find a new model to do it) or move elsewhere.",1226266739

Because there will always be a need for stuff that ""really compiles"" rather than ""compiles with respect to the JVM"" for both performance, and reliability issues.<p>In my personal opinion, Java is a fad for children. However, that may be a bit harsh. Perhaps Java too has its place. But just as sport cars, loved by teenagers, won't ever replace the need for a reliable sedan in one's more mature years, similarly, there will always be grownup applications that need the speed and reliability of c/c++, even if they are not as ""easy to program"" (read: rely on plug-in libs) or are not as ""flashy"" in terms of the ui. Just as I personally no longer fancy swing sets, I really haven't a need for SWING either. :-)<p>(Oh, one other thing I almost forgot: Java doesn't have pointers. No programming language without pointers should be taken seriously by people who have reached age 21. It's kind of like having a car without a combustion engine. It's just nonsense.)",1226266397

Whenever someone in the country works hard and produces something, it benefits every person in the US, including you and me.

That it has allowed (by this point) a generation of mathematicians, scientists, and increasingly tens of thousands (at least) of others writing structured documents, particularly academics, to also create beautiful books and journal articles, and is the backbone of mathematical publishing these days, is incidental.<p>If corporate documents are mostly created with Microsoft products, it is certainly not about the ease with which those products can be used to create structured documents (hint: it's nearly impossible to use them for that), but rather about market-share network effects, highly effective monopolistic tactics on Microsoft's part, and (a wrong) general perception about the relative merits of different methods.<p>I'll agree with you that TeX (or even LaTeX or ConTeXT) is no walk in the park, but to suggest that it has a particularly high barrier to entry, especially compared to the knowledge required to, e.g., write out a high-level mathematical formula longhand and have any clue what it's saying, is so overblown it becomes absurd.<p>The market for document preparation systems is brutal, and TeX has never had effective evangelism or much real attempt to make it ""newbie-friendly"".

""Indoctrination"" is a bit of a loaded word, perhaps I should have said ""assimilation"" or ""acculturation"".  But it was definitely a major factor.  I remember reading a long paper about the movement establishing universal high school in New Haven in the early 1900's.  It all revolved around dealing with the massive flows of immigrants who had no grounding in American civic culture.<p>As for credentialing laws, pretty much all professions rely on some level of book knowledge plus on the job training.  The book knowledge can be provided for by reading books and passing an exam.  You don't need to attend three years of law school in person to become a great lawyer.  Nor do you need four years of university to be a great engineer.  The architecture profession seems to have been much better off without any degree requirements.  Just compare the architecture of the 1800's to that of the past few decades.<p>30% of jobs in the U.S. economy now have legal credentialing requirements.  That includes everything from hair dresser to interior designer.  Even jobs like parole officer now require a four year college degree.

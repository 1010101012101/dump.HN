To avoid being bad, you don&#x27;t have to overcompensate; that just creates reverse biases. Just don&#x27;t have a bias: for instance, don&#x27;t make a decision because someone is a woman, or Asian or whatever. Any decision: hiring, awarding a raise or promotion, etc.<p>A discriminatory bias cannot be measured by simple proportions, like how many women work at Company X out of the total, and therefore it cannot be eliminated by something naive like a hiring quota or similar. Such a program <i>necessarily</i> involves making decisions based on gender, and so on and so doesn&#x27;t avoid being bad.<p>The concept of &quot;workforce diversity&quot; is basically rooted in poor understanding of statistics, together with a willingness to apply a corrective discrimination.\nEven if half the software developers in a country are women, and there is no bias anywhere, it can still so happen that men constitute, say, 80% of the developers in some organization.

I suspect that if he thought he were being ripped off, he would easily move to either a large corporation or a startup where he was getting a better deal.<p>As for 95th percentile developers making their own products or businesses, that&#x27;s a completely independent skill with little correlation to software development ability. Beyond writing the software, you&#x27;ve got to market and sell the product, set up distribution channels, support the product, etc. I&#x27;d consider myself a respectable developer, but I have no delusions that my development skills translate to any of the other skills required to build a business. I&#x27;m generally content to execute in a software development role for someone who has the broader vision and skills to build a business around that product.<p>And lastly, I wouldn&#x27;t base an assessment of your skill as a developer on your compensation. In current and previous roles, I&#x27;ve seen a number of salary lists, and there was zero correlation between pay and talent. Some of the most highly-paid developers were near worthless and some of the most solid developers were paid 25-40% less.

This seems to be a fair statement with a lot of empirical support.<p>An alternative theory for explaining Keynes&#x27; mistake is just that people&#x27;s consumption is driven by desire for relative status, a zero-sum game, and therefore people will continue to work to consume more no matter how productive they become.  But what is the evidence that free markets <i>generate</i> these desires rather than merely fulfill them?  Yes of course marketing will have a hand in determining which goods are high-status, but I don&#x27;t know much reason to believe that people would stop consuming for status in the absence of marketing.

That&#x27;s because the Java and C++ people can create bidding wars every year and spike their salaries, whereas using a better but more niche language makes that career strategy untenable.<p>I haven&#x27;t found the same to be true for other languages, but in my experience the Average Haskeller is so caught up in academic exercises, technical one-upmanship, and code golf shenanigans that I&#x27;m surprised they find any time to contribute any business value at all. Having a discussion about acceptable levels of technical debt with a Haskeller is like having a discussion about acceptable levels of meat products in your diet with a vegan in a world where there are no plant foods...<i>&quot;everything is technical debt, and none of it is acceptable, and we absolutely can&#x27;t move on until we change all relevant functors to applicatives and all nested record accesses to lenses!&quot;</i><p>And it is squarely a cultural issue, not a technical one...it is quite obvious that Haskell is a fantastically powerful language and capable of mowing over most enterprise-y languages with ease for a very wide variety of domains. Its just that Haskellers are so nitpicky about elegance and style that they don&#x27;t know how to let shit be shit and get something done when it is needed.<p>This obviously isn&#x27;t the only case for Haskellers.

This is great advice about kickstarting your networking.  When I did a retrospective on my career, I realized that the various jobs or gigs that I had were directly related to my informally-developed network.<p>Networking is a bit time-consuming, but it will serve you well in the rest of your career.<p>The other thing I would say (as one who has gone through this more than one time.  The actual number of times is a trade secret) is don&#x27;t delay the start of the search. For example, if they parted company with you on Friday, start working on it on Monday. And it sounds like you have a jump on it already.<p>The other thing to keep in mind is to not spend more than say 30 hours a week on a job search.  Despite your relatively positive outlook, it will be quite stressful and it is important to break away from the search activity regularly.<p>Edit: typos",1450463712

(As an aside, something like 70% of people say the most stressful part of their job is their boss.  So if there are ways to screen for working with someone who is willing to take the time to cultivate you, amazing.)  I think it&#x27;s tough, especially for the generation of students graduating from college right now (millennials coached to believe they need to have a HUGE impact wherever they go and to believe that their contributions are insanely important), to understand that a first job is just a first step and is not career-defining, in my opinion.

This amount includes all construction elements, but does not include land acquisition.<p>Elsewhere I gave links to places which said the installation costs for a roundabout were more expensive than signals. I don&#x27;t know if the extra 5-10% price of the &quot;box with a computer&quot; changes the balance.<p>I tried to get numbers for the cost of a intersection. from <a href=""http://azdot.gov/business/engineering-and-construction/traffic/faq/pros-and-cons-of-traffic-signals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://azdot.gov/business/engineering-and-construction/traff...</a>:<p>> A modern signal can cost taxpayers between $80,000 and $100,000 to install, depending on the complexity of the intersection and the characteristics of the traffic using it. On top of this, there is the perpetual cost of the electrical power consumed in operating a signalized intersection 24 hours a day. This cost now averages about $1,400 per year.<p>However, that appears to be for the dumb light, and not one with &#x27;cameras and network connections&#x27; or even magnetic sensors. From <a href=""http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/02/450000_traffic_light_cost_eyed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/02/450000_traffi...</a> :<p>>  A request to spend $450,000 to install a new traffic signal on Easthampton Road remains an option for the City Council.<p>> And while the price tag might seem high for one traffic light, city officials insist that&#x27;s the going rate to design and install such an item.<p>> &quot;They&#x27;re smarter controllers than they ever were in the past,&quot; Department of Public Works Superintendent William D. Fuqua said yesterday.<p>It&#x27;s definitely not clear to me that the high-tech, interconnected system you desire is cheaper or more effective than roundabouts. (Again, there are clearly place where signals are more effective. I am not saying to only use rounabouts.) I would be happy to read any evidence you have which says otherwise.<p>This also means I don&#x27;t think you can call out &quot;environmentalists&quot; for not yet pushing for your high-tech dream to come to fruition. Mind you, some of those environmentalists are pushing for &quot;complete streets&quot;, which is yet another way to achieve comparable goals of more effective use of public roads.",1450463468

I can only hope you&#x27;re exaggerating (well, I know you&#x27;re exaggerating, the universities that matter still do vet their intake relatively rigorously).<p>By very definition most people go to universities or institutions that &quot;don&#x27;t matter&quot; in your eyes. You can&#x27;t rule out the majority of the population in a discussion about the nature of higher education just because it doesn&#x27;t fit your narrative about what college should be.<p>Moreover, to assume that everyone at top tier institutions is there or is trying hard because they are deeply passionate about learning is absolutely ridiculous. I am at a lab at MIT currently and interact with undergrads here all the time. The community has a HUGE problem with self-imposed stress over grades and course load to the point where individuals are committing suicide because they falsely believe that if they are not successful in college it will prevent them from being successful in the work place. Why do many people put themselves through this pressure? Because they know having the words MIT on their resume will get them a great job.<p>> Incorrect. For 9 out of 10 professions it is not true at all.<p>I don&#x27;t know how they do things in the UK, but in the US employers want to see proof that you can do what you say you can do or that you are a serious worker when applying for a job. For a lot of industries, it&#x27;s really hard to demonstrate this when applying for a first job because you have no relevant work experience. A relevant college degree (rightly or wrongly) serves as validation for employers. They feel safer taking a chance on employing you. Even having ANY college degree shows that someone has (theoretically) validated that you can work intelligently.<p>The problem with not having a degree is that it&#x27;s very difficult to gain demonstrable domain expertise in most fields without being employed (as you lack access to resources), and most people won&#x27;t employ you until you can demonstrate some competence, leading to a situation where it&#x27;s very difficult to get your foot in the door. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to have a degree; it gets your foot in the door so you can gain experience. Most people in the US who do not have college degrees or technical certifications are working poorly paid jobs. Most people go to college so that they do not have to do that, not so that they can seek enlightenment.<p>> It is a filter. Doctors must conform to quite harsh endurance and resourcefulness requirements, and the more such filters applied - the better. This is not a profession for everyone (just like most other professions, really)<p>Putting someone through a 4 year arbitrary filter is a ridiculous practice which should stop. Unqualified students would wash out during the first year of medical school anyway; that should serve as the filter. Making someone rack up 80-120K in additional student debt just to go through a filtering process is absurd. A friend of mine is currently a resident and has 320K dollars of student loan debt.

I don&#x27;t think you have anything to worry about skills-wise. PHP is still in high-demand. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aren&#x27;t going anywhere anytime soon.<p>Relax. You are in a fantastic position. You will hopefully even get a salary increase with your next job. The local paper couldn&#x27;t have been paying much. : )<p>The only concern might be your location. &quot;Local newspaper&quot; makes me think &quot;rural&quot; or &quot;suburban.&quot; If you don&#x27;t live in a city, that might not be a problem (teleworking jobs abound), but where I live (Northern Virginia) I can quit my job today and have recruiters begging me to start somewhere else tomorrow. So just keep that in mind.<p>Otherwise, I hope you will find yourself very happy this time next year in a new career and all this worry will just be a fading memory.",1450463061

If you came in as a frontend dev want to do more about backend work, go find gossip about new projects and express your areas of interest to higher ups. If you want manage people, offer to improve the technical hiring test. If something is stupid (maybe there&#x27;s burnout due to too much overtime, or a process is over-bureaucratic, or some aspect of development is too cowboy), be proactive and offer solutions.<p>The unique thing about small companies is that there are enough people that narrowmindedness and complacency start to appear (and with it, process problems), which gives you plenty of opportunities to prove yourself with out-of-the-box thinking, but not enough bureaucracy to prevent you from being able to make changes.",1450463031

Human psychology works in ways not completely anticipated by classical liberal economists like Adam Smith (although Smith deserves more credit than he gets for a deep understanding of human psychology). One interesting paragraph in the review tells the tale: &quot;To support this claim, Akerlof and Shiller point to an uncanny prediction by John Maynard Keynes in 1930. Keynes expected that by 2030, the standard of living would be eight times higher. We are on track to get in that vicinity. At the same time, Keynes made a profound mistake. He predicted that the workweek would plummet to fifteen hours and that people would struggle not with financial problems, but with a surfeit of leisure. That isn’t going to happen. What Keynes missed is that free markets generate new desires. In Akerlof and Shiller’s words, markets &#x27;do not just produce what we really want; they also produce what we want according to our monkey-on-the-shoulder tastes.&#x27;&quot; In other words, producers can act jointly more effectively than consumers can in exploiting weaknesses of human psychology. This seems to be a fair statement with a lot of empirical support.<p>I think the reviewer does a good job at the end of his review of critiquing the book&#x27;s view of behavioral economics by asking for more specificity about which mechanisms most lead to &quot;phishing&quot; (dishonest marketplace behavior to fool consumers). To say that free markets take advantage of consumers does not guarantee that making markets less free is any better for consumers, unless some new form of regulation is based on careful research and an affirmation of commonly held human values.",1450462813

I guess I&#x27;m quoted in the article too. :-)<p>All I can say is that the market is actually a lot more efficient than most people give it credit for.  I remember coming out of school and thinking &quot;Why would anyone work for a big company when the payouts for startups are so much better?&quot;  After a bunch of experience, I&#x27;ve found that:<p>1. Those big startup payouts are much rarer than a typical new grad conceives.  They&#x27;re also more widely distributed: perception is that startups are &quot;go big or go home&quot;, but a number of companies end in talent acquisitions that are just slightly less or more than what the founders would&#x27;ve earned at a big company.<p>2. Compensation at big companies varies wildly, and people with the effort & effectiveness levels that you&#x27;d expect from a startup often are actually making startup-level money.  There is <i>zero</i> reason for anyone doing this to publicize that fact, and oftentimes they&#x27;re contractually forbidden from disclosing it.<p>For people trying to decide between these - forget about the financial rewards and ask yourself &quot;What would you like your working life to be like?&quot;  I&#x27;d also forget the common wisdom about startups = no life & big companies = drudging pace; both of these are inaccurate on a micro-level, and you can find startups that prioritize work-life balance or teams within a big company where everyone&#x27;s life revolves around work.<p>Instead, think about the problems you would like to solve.  Do you want to do cutting edge research that pushes humanity&#x27;s knowledge forwards?  Work for a research lab or big company&#x27;s research department.  Do you want to bring new technologies to the masses?  Then you want a startup, probably one that has spun out of a major university with a couple professors as founders.  Do you want to put social hacks in motion and bring technology to ordinary lives?  That&#x27;s probably also a startup, probably one with young founders.  Do you want to scale technologies and work with big data or machine learning?  Big company; startups usually lack ownership of enough data, unless they&#x27;re a consultancy.  Do you want to apply technology to an industry that currently does things backwardly?  Join a startup whose founders have significant domain knowledge in that industry.<p>If you work on problems that you believe in, you&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;re much more effective at solving them.

You may be thinking of the &quot;/dev/random vs. /dev/urandom&quot; argument, which says it&#x27;s stupid to _block_ on reseeding based on some arbitrary heuristic (and which I agree with). However, that doesn&#x27;t mean reseeding is unnecessary. Even a CSPRNG cycles and you need to reseed before it does so or the wheels start to come off. Generators become less random looking even before cycling. The general rule is that you shouldn&#x27;t use more than sqrt(cycle length) from a single generator.<p>If you use a secure n-bit block cipher in counter mode, for instance (generally considered a &quot;good CSPRNG&quot;) then the generated numbers start to become distinguishable from random after 2^(n/2) generated blocks due to lack of collisions. This is a weak statement, but the point is any proofs that assume randomness (likely all proofs of hardness of crypto reversal) no longer hold. If you don&#x27;t reseed before this point then you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Other desirable characteristics of CSPRNGs, like forward secrecy, may require periodic (or frequent) reseeding depending on algorithm.<p>Best practice for a source of secure &quot;randomness&quot; is to use an entropy accumulator that finds as much &quot;true entropy&quot; as it can and constantly mixes that into a pool (while protecting against injection attacks), then to use a good CSPRNG algorithm to &quot;stretch&quot; the available entropy since true entropy is a scarce resource. That&#x27;s what urandom and OpenSSL do, for instance (see Yarrow/Fortuna for a good design).<p>A lot of thought has been put into the design of urandom. Pulling one random seed from urandom and stretching it forever in user-space is _not_ equivalent. You could probably design something in user-space that _is_ as secure, but it&#x27;s not trivial.",1450461669

There is nothing wrong with that, and a great deal right with it. It&#x27;s the basis of market segmentation.<p>Selling &quot;shrink wrapped&quot; software is a different business than SaaS. Support infrastructure is different...and probably less efficient. Distribution infrastructure is required. More importantly, customer expectations are different. The software company starts owning client decisions regarding platforms and hardware and configuration that are out of their control. And your client has told you that they want to run your software on configurations that reflect decisions that are outside your control. These could be dynamic, e.g. your company on the hook when they move from in-house hardware to AWS or Azure or Bob&#x27;s Discount Cloud Mart.<p>As far as pricing, my take is that it should cover the costs of going into an entirely new market segment. That means covering the cost of additional engineering, support, and sales. It should be priced for <i>serious</i> buyers, i.e. at <i>many</i> thousands of dollars per month. It should reflect the value the customer places on running your software on their hardware.<p>To put it another way, the approach to a client who runs your software on their hardware is as a consultancy. &quot;Nickling and diming&quot; is the core of successful consultancy. It&#x27;s a linear growth activity. The price should be just slightly less than the probable cost of the client reproducing your service with it&#x27;s own developers times the time value of money divided by the probability of it being successful. This is a big number which is why they are willing to pay for your service.<p>So my gut is, go big if you want to be in the consulting business. Otherwise, stick to product.<p>Good luck.",1450461640

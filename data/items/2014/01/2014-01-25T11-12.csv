Some similar cities have addressed this by merging with their surrounding county (Indianapolis, for example, which is about 368 sq/mi), but even those that haven&#x27;t (e.g. Kansas City) still cover a much larger portion of their region (316 sq/mi for KC).<p>It&#x27;s very easy to exit the city-proper in St. Louis and not feel at all as though you&#x27;ve left the core of the city.

That is to say, if you define almost any city as only its most inner core, then you&#x27;re going to end up with much higher crime rates than if you include its suburbs.

You can do better than ok with $400k in Seattle if you are willing to go condo.<p>Texas has bad schools, high Crome, dumpster divers everywhere. Washington state is a first world country in comparison. Even some boondocks place like Spokane where houses still go for $150k compares well to Texas (though the tech jobs are all in Seattle).",1390648114

Before oo&#x27;s (I&#x27;ll leave the asterisks out) bid, the highest bid amount was $89&#x27;100 by e7. oo then bid an amount between $89&#x27;900 and $90&#x27;000. At this point, eBay only displays $89&#x27;300 bid, the higher amount is retained as a (non-displayed) maximum bid.\nLater on, another bidder (probably ss) upped the price in $200 increments: they bid $89&#x27;300 (to which eBay publicised oo&#x27;s <i>previous</i> maximum bid of over $89&#x27;300), then $89&#x27;500 and so on.<p>In this system, the highest bid always wins -- bid amount being equal, the <i>earlier</i> bid prevails.",1390647961
7120497,comment,7120348,7120478,8,0,hackinthebochs,,,"Ebay only shows the leading bid any time a big is placed. So when someone bids higher than the currently visible bid, but lower than that person&#x27;s max bid, the leading bidder is shown as placing another, larger bid. You end up with the appearance of someone outbidding themselves repeatedly.",1390647854

It allows you to distill a complex world to a simplified negative caricature that justifies not making an effort yourself (or makes your efforts seem more extraordinary than warranted).<p>My personal counter anecdote: 2 weeks ago, I lost my camera (with a nice new lens on it) in the subway. Worth more than $700. Everyone I told said almost the same thing: &quot;you&#x27;ll never see it again, someone would have to be stupid to give it back; I would, but I&#x27;m stupid.&quot;<p>Well, 2 days later I picked it up at the lost&found.",1390647804

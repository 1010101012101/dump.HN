I am someone who raised two very challengin children and whose advice was valued by Harvard graduates and similar ilk when I was able to help them deal with their kids, sometimes after all kinds of paid professionals failed them. I write. People send me emails and gush at me about how wonderful my writing is and all this crap. I find out later that they are big names, in the news, etc. Every last one of them refuses to promote my work. They tell me it is amazing, awesome, their life is so much better for knowing me etc etc. None of them will tweet about it, blog about, and so on. I have asked. I have been pissed on for asking. If I named names, you would likely recognize some of them. If I do, I am cutting my own throat. If I don't, I am viewed as a delusional egomaniac and teller of tall tales. If half the people who gushed at me promoted me eben once, I would have traffic, probably of the kind that crashes servers. Instead, I get called a troll for trying to figure how to get money out of something which ckearly has value to people. It is extremely crazymaking and at the moment I am pretty goddamned bitter about it.<p>But thank you for the feedback.",1341687454

When I first started out I talked to several successful entrepreneurs who were living in Vancouver at the time and got some rather interesting advice. Paraphrasing: Move to the valley. There are too many reasons to be there. Don't be a patriot - and don't be a martyr.<p>Lack of critical mass in any of these ""tech hubs"", overall aversion to risk, lower paying jobs, and ease of moving to the valley are all cards stacked against you before you even start.<p>Many smart people realize that and they leave - critical mass is incredibly difficult to achieve when you're still bleeding all that talent. This is why having anchor tenants - large companies that draw talent in is so important. We can just never seem to have more than one at at time, and then they're mis-managed into oblivion.",1341687327

Styuli have been used by humans for a few millenia now with no real issues, until one prominent human decided he didn't ""want a little scribble thing"" and subsequently wiped out the market for them.<p>If you're using touchpads, going from touchpad to stylus is exactly the same switch as going from finger paint to pen. If you're using a mouse, then using a stylus allows for less awkward wrist motion.<p>Absolute positioning is AWESOME for static or mostly static UI elements: menu bars, browser tabs, buttons on websites since your brain can calculate 'ahead of time' how much it needs to move. It's also much more accurate when performing small motor movements (hence why it's used for drawing, but this also comes in to play for highlighting text).

Doing a hybrid app correctly can in many cases require much more work than simply doing a native app, both technically (there are a lot of very tricky caching issues, since UIWebViews don't properly handle cache manifests) and design-wise in terms of nailing the behavior and feel of a native app. Hybrid apps are neither a complete usability disaster nor a silver bullet that gives you a 'write once, run anywhere' utopia.",1341685673

The labor theory is no longer a part of mainstream economics, replaced by marginal theory [2], but I suppose many people still imagine value of things as equal to the labor put into them.<p>Uh, what? Why do people that have never read Marx think they can get away with this kind of thing? You only have to read the same wiki page you have linked to to see that what you claim Marx never thought about is in fact very much so part of the theory. According to Marx commodities under capitalism have different kinds of ""values""; one of them is their ""use-value"", which measures whether the item is in fact useful for a given purpose for anyone. In a market economy a commodity only realizes its value (usually seen in the monetary expression of its exchange-value, or price) when it is actually sold: ie, value is realized at the point of sale, not production. Thus no matter how much labor you put into something, if nobody actually wants it for anything it has no value at all. This kind of misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the LTV is so popular it has its own nickname: the mud pie fallacy, see for example <a href=""http://kapitalism101.wordpress.com/2010/05/13/law-of-value-3-das-mudpie/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kapitalism101.wordpress.com/2010/05/13/law-of-value-3...</a><p>This whole thing is explained, plain as day, in all of Marx's works on this topic, including the most famous one, Capital.

4212325,comment,4212153,4212153,9,0,peterkelly,,,"I'm of the view that in general, it's better to code directly to the iOS APIs rather than trying to implement everything in a UIWebView. Having said that, I've just spent a substantial amount of time developing a word processing application (UX Write), which uses a UIWebView for all document layout, and a large amount of ""backend"" code in javascript for performing editing operations. All the UI code however is written in Objective C and the Cocoa Touch APIs.<p>The advantage of using native controls it it provides a much greater integration with the rest of the operating system, and makes it easier to make your app work in the same manner as other apps. For example, there are many features of iOS that are not exposed through javascript APIs, and for that you have no option but to use native code. Nonetheless, I like what Microsoft is doing with providing javascript APIs for metro development, and though I haven't tried it myself, it looks like a good approach.<p>There are a number of serious problems with the current UIWebView which are also holding it back as development tool:<p>- You have very limited control over touch events. In my case, I completely disabled all default event handling on the web view, and implemented my own touch event handlers in Objective C, which pass the events through to javascript.<p>- Selection is broken. You can access the selection, but not modify it. I spent several weeks completely reimplementing the selection & cursor mechanism because of this. One positive outcome though was it gives me much more fine-grained control over user interaction issues.<p>- contentEditable is also broken. I spent probably 3-4 months reimplementing this functionality myself in javascript to make it usable<p>- Interfacing between Objective C and Javascript is tricky. Going from ObjC -> JS is fast, but going in the other direction using the technique from the article is painfully slow. There a ways to work around this but it's inelegant and doesn't allow return values from callback functions.<p>- Lack of Nitro support, as discussed elsewhere. It turns out that for my particular needs performance is quite acceptable, but for more compute-intensive apps like games it's a must. I can understand Apple's desire to prevent W+X permission on memory, but this could be solved by running JS code in a separate process and communicating with the host process via shared memory.<p>Apple have done some amazing things with WebKit, but the iOS port leaves a lot to be desired. I would really like to see them improve these apps so people can better integrate web content & backend functionality. But I still think you should be using Cocoa Touch for your UI.",1341685564

4212272,comment,4209406,4210604,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"All digital goods have infinite supply and yet even for goods that can be acquired for free (say Ubuntu distributions), there are markets (the $10 starter DVD). Once a digital good is 'produced' replication costs and distribution costs approach zero, or at least to a marginal cost of zero given the sunk cost of the infrastructure (one pays of internet bandwidth but doesn't normally charge it against digital purchases).<p>So my claim is that in a digital marketplace the quantity supplied of a good can meet any quantity demanded. Thus classical Keynesian economic theory doesn't work well. Since by the math if supply is infinite even selling for a small cost can give good returns (cost to produce is now zero after all) there is no compelling reason to sell at a fixed cost, but demand isn't infinite.<p>So why do people pay for 'free' information? (and yes some don't, this isn't a piracy discussion). Given these sorts of questions I've been working on what it is that gives information value. What are the economics of information?<p>One answer to that explains Google's success. Information can become valuable if it is timely, which is to say it meets a need in a very time efficient way. So high frequency  stock market traders pay through the nose to know a few milliseconds earlier what the trades are. Google sells the fact that someone has just looked for <query terms> to someone who thinks they have an answer related to <query terms>. Someone is looking, the advertiser can provide, so what makes a search advertisement so valuable is that the intent behind the search is 'known.' Previous venues tried to sell the 'kind of people who are looking at these pages' the demographics. A less precise form of targeting but similar.<p>But back to the Parse discussion, one of the factors that appears to influence information value is its rarity, or difficulty in obtaining. So a picture of some celebrity's new baby is 'rare' and 'hard to get' so a paparazzi gets a big payday when they get that picture. But a picture from the agent's press packet on the birth? Not so much.<p>Applications seem to be more valuable if they are perceived as being 'hard to write' (perhaps this is a variation on bike shedding) than ones that are perceived to be 'easy.' And that affects personal statements of value as well, how many developers refuse to buy an app they feel they could write in a weekend and yet non-developers flock to it?<p>My claim is that classic economic supply and demand models don't apply to digital goods because the supply of the goods can be infinite and the classic model suggests prices would go to zero in that scenario.",1341684409

I assume local regulatory boards will respond to any economic impact caused by the law by setting regulations that they intend to be followed consistently. I expect a period of confusion and litigation to give way to a much safer, saner roadway.<p>The current system of semi-arbitrary rules with extraordinarily selective enforcement is utterly inane, and has nothing to recommend it except that it may be somewhat safer than having no rules at all.

1797581,comment,1795415,1797048,0,0,euccastro,,,"""Minding your own business"" may be a loaded phrase there, though. Much of the misery in Africa is a direct result of western exploitation. That includes much misery the proximate cause of which is corrupt leaders. Guess who keeps many of them there.<p>She has a point that truly letting Africa ""take care of itself"" may be more effective than any aid. But that statement is not primarily about aid, and withdrawing aid doesn't help with the subjacent problems.",1287215859

There were many mentions about the ""fractal set"" just being ""fancy"" maths. He learned from the community while remaining unique in the community. But now there are many relationship with other model like ""diffusion-limited aggregation"" (DLA) and the fractal set is now one of the many models to describe our environment.",1287215651

It does turn on instantaneously from sleep, as does my MacBook Pro (aside from some significant caveats, such as the time it takes to re-join a wireless network). The trick with the iPad is that sleep is the state you get when pressing the button that looks suspiciously like a power button.  The iPad also does not have a Safe Sleep or Hibernate state like the MacBook does, so it will drain battery until turning itself completely off.<p>Is the solution to design a laptop that you never turn completely off except in rare circumstances?",1287214250

In a society where most people have varying notions about programming and network security, it is easy to con people and make money by giving them false promises and hopes of becoming a ""hacker"".
The people who are conned can hardly be blamed(which is not normally, always the case), as not everyone can be expected to understand the art of programming. It is this weakness that is being exploited by security courses which promise to teach ""Ethical Hacking in 30 days"". Ankit Fadia and his course AFCEH, India's most famous (fake) hacker, is yet another example.<p>As a programmer, what do you think is the right way to give people a realistic, if not accurate picture of the current state of networking security around them?

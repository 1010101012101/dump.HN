This sounds very similar to a ""magic cloud"" that exists in many architecture diagrams :)<p>ADD: And if you're looking at software providers, I'd be interested in running the numbers to see how their business model would work. They'd have to take payment. They'd have to be bonded. They'd have to collect from the states, provide a categorization system, keep files updated, file paperwork along with monies. Would they have to work internationally? Be categorized as a money Exchanger by treasury department? It doesn't sound cheap. But it certainly sounds like something Amazon would be happy to provide as an API.",1366825734

There is also data you produce your like your holiday pictures, your running itinerary and performance...\nThis is very convenient simply to access it, but the real value lies in letting users total control and freedom in the way they decide to use it.\nThere is no restriction for the user to access its data, no restrictive API, it's there and ready to be used. Programmers can develop their own tools to do quantified-self for instande and mashup any data they want. Also applications can develop like for instance, a ""travel"" app. Everything related to your travel, from pictures, to receipts to persons you met are in your private cloud, and this hypothetical app would be a way to remind a journey differently. Because everything run in your personal place you control, there is no need to communicate your data in many case hence the bonus for privacy.\nThat doesn't mean you isolate yourself from companies, data disclosure project aims to give users a way to correct information companies hold on the user, to update their information in one place, and to let them remove information they don't want. More trust is good for business. Users could decide to share more data with companies and receive discounts, or directly give feedback on the product.\nUltimately it is all about giving users the same tools that companies have to deal with the relationship. It brings more transparency and control over privacy.\nIf I sparked your curiosity, I highly recommend you reading about project VRM by Doc Searls, and visiting the Personal Data Ecosystem Consortum. All this could seem crazy right know but this is really happening pushed by government's Data disclosure projects.

This is indeed an actual problem, but it's one with an easy solution: you just make each backend process listen on multiple ports, and list them all as separate entries in the nginx's upstream{} section for that backend. One backend with 1024 ports open = 67M connections nginx can make to that backend.<p>Again, you're not ""using up"" local ports, just (IP/port, IP/port) pairs--so increasing the number of <i>remote</i> ports you want to talk to allows you to make more connections just as well as if you could increase the number of <i>local</i> ports used to talk to them.<p>(This might not be so simple for some servers which expect to only listen on one port; the workaround is to use multiple <i>IPs</i> for the backend server, and make sure the backend process is listening on 0.0.0.0. They don't have to be real IPs--you can just as well do port-forwarding on the backend box from one-IP:lots-of-ports to lots-of-virtual-IPs:one-port. It's simple enough to listen on multiple ports in both Node and Erlang, though, so this probably doesn't matter for most people writing websocket servers.)",1366824989

Long version: <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-pro...</a><p>A personal anecdote: In 2006 I wrote CRUD apps, talked to people, and read a lot of documents.  In 2013 I will write CRUD apps, talk to people, and read a lot of documents.  I'll also get paid probably in excess of 10X what I made in 2006.  To the extent that the difference involves programming, it's largely not because I've suddenly graduated to Guru Rockstar Ninja and more because I figured out how to apply programming to a few of capitalism's pressure points.  (Mostly involving selling more software.)  This turns out to be fantastically more valuable than writing CRUD apps to e.g. manage student lists for university back offices.  This difference is a <i>lot</i> more important than other competing explanations like where I live, what industry I work in, or the fact that I changed from J2EE to (mostly) Ruby on Rails in the interim.<p>There are many HNers whose programming skill is a key asset to their line of work and yet would not be classified as programmers, by the way.  I encourage you to not see their jobs as out-of-scope if your goals are making a lot of money while continuing to program.  That's quite a bit of the solution set.

Once they are withdrawn there is nothing paypal could do, of course this removes the immediacy of payment aspect of bitcoin so merchants may not want it.<p>Really because bitcoinoffers low fees this sort of service would be of benefit to the buyer only.<p>Alternatively PayPal could use bitcoin as their backend for transferring money internationally.

That means no penalties or fees for mistakes.</i> -- What the bill actually provides is that a business that uses a certified provider will not be liable for errors ""if the liability is the result of an error or omission made by a certified software provider."" (Section 2.b.2.E of the bill) The business remains fully liable for any penalties, etc., that are due to errors or mistakes that originate with errors or omissions the business itself makes.<p>Other notably imprecisions: \n<i>There is a ""small seller exemption"". If you collect less than $1,000,000 a year from out-of-state customers, you will have no new obligations under this bill.</i> The small seller exemption applies based on remote sales the <i>prior</i> calendar year, so you'll <i>never</i> have any obligation the first calendar year in which you have remote sales, even if you have $10 million in sales out the gate, and you'll never retroactively become liable for taxes for sales earlier in the year as a simple $1 million/year threshold would suggest. OTOH, you also can will liable for remote sales taxes in a year where you have less than $1 million in remote sales, if it is preceded by a year in which you had more than $1 million in remote sales.<p><i>Online sellers will be required to collect, report and pay sales taxes in all of the states (once the states meet certain requirements), rather than only the states the seller has a physical presence in.</i> Well, all of the states that (a) have sales and use taxes, and (b) choose to apply them to remote sales. Presumably, all the states that meet (a) will eventually do (b), but not all states have sales and use taxes to start with.<p><i>Each state that wants ""remote sellers"" to collect sales tax must establish a single entity to manage tax collection and audits for the entire state. Sellers wont have to deal with all 5,900+ separate taxing municipalities in the country, just 50.</i> This makes the typical mistake of assuming that there are 50 'states' in the sense used in the act, but that's not correct; 'state' in the bill are defined to include ""each of the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United States."", so there are not less than 57 potential taxing authorities.",1366823986

5602665,comment,5602028,5602028,1,0,Mz,,,"I think the trend towards educational choice and diversity will continue.<p>I have an AA, a couple of certificates (one from a technical college that my former employer sent me to), and I am a few classes short of a BS. I have taken plenty of classes on a college campus but have also taken online classes, condensed classes aimed at adults, and other stuff. I have also homeschooled my kids and what I know about running websites and writing code comes from books, educational CDs, websites, online discussion and other forms of uncredentialed ""independent"" or self study.<p>For my websites, I don't need any credentials. The king's stamp will not make them gold. Either I put up something good that has value to other people and I figure out how to get traffic and monetize it or I don't. A diploma makes zero difference. That doesn't mean taking courses would do nothing. That means if I took a class and it taught me something useful it would make a difference. But listing my educational credentials will have little to no impact on usability, appeal, etc for my websites. I get it right or I don't.<p>Since I don't plan to get a regular job again, credentials are not terribly important to me. I was STAR student, a National Merit Scholarship winner, inducted into Mu Alpha Theta in 11th grade (that's a college math honor society), state alternate for the governor's honors program, blah blah blah. None of that made very much difference in my life in terms of employability and income or certain other critical areas. I was a homemaker for a long time. My educational background and typing, math etc skills helped me get a better than minimum wage job while going through a divorce but I never got a promotion in part because of my health issues. Since I have special needs in that regard (and for other reasons), credentialing is of little importance to my life. Credibility is something I need more and that's a completely different animal.<p>So it depends a lot on your goals and needs. With a few billion people on the planet, we can easily support a diversity of educational approaches. There are plenty of people to fill both roles of provider and consumer. Even a fairly niche area or approach can routinely fill a class. That wasn't always true.",1366823798

I believe that friction starts to occur on somewhere around 10+ fields.<p>Here's a couple of other theories as to why your new approach works better:<p>Commitment: When you initially ask for JUST an email address from a prospect, it's kind of like starting a conversation with someone by saying ""Hey what's your phone number"" without even caring to ask for their name and a proper introduction. Basically their email is the most valuable piece of information they have to give you, and immediately going for it sends the wrong message. Presenting them with a full form (that includes their name, company, maybe a job function) conveys that you really care to know about them and sets the expectation that they will get something useful out of any interaction with you.<p>Convention: I've encountered more signup processes where the request for contact information is front-loaded. It's simply what internet citizens are more accustomed to. In fact some users may have thought that by giving you their email address, they were done, and didn't even carefully review the ""verify your address to proceed"" email.

Yesterday, I received a takedown notice from Amazon that advised me to contact Rubik's Cube's security team.  Their representative sent me this note:<p>> (Y)our images of the cube is infringing our designrights. Please see attached certificate. You will have to change the design of your cube or get a license from Rubik's Cube.<p>> Attachment: http://goo.gl/08Cq6<p>I'm based in the US and they are based in Sweden.

I don't know what the rules are in Europe.<p>The name, design, and logo of Cognicube are distinctively mine.  I don't believe the concept of sliding colored bricks to solve a puzzle is protectable in the US.<p>The only thing I can see in their application that is even remotely similar to Cognicube is their logo.  It's is an isometric projection of a Rubik's Cube from the corner.  In the tablet version of Cognicube, there's a view that shows all six faces of the cube displayed in quasi-3D.  It's not my logo, and it's drawn from a different angle than the image in their trademark.

When I gave them an initial estimate for this project, it was based on two assumptions:<p>1. The API would be documented.\n2. The iOS source would be reasonably well constructed.<p>Having received access to both the API and the iOS source, neither of these assumptions have proved true.<p>The API is barely documented, there are redundant methods (with some deprecated or discontinued, but not mentioned), data is repeated across models without any reason, and worst of all most calls return silently without any indication of success or failure.<p>The iOS application is the result of several years of low-budget contractors throwing together code. None of it is commented, there is code duplication all over the place, and it aids very little in the construction of the Android application.<p>Because of this, it now looks like building an API client alone will take me almost as long as the original project estimate. Further complicating things is that I start a new job at the end of the month (the original project would have been finished much before my start date), but now there's no way I can get the whole application done before that date.<p>I'm not sure what to do.

Those that have a specific knowledge, most often, can charge higher, often ridiculous, rates. It doesn't even have to be languages or frameworks. It could be implementing large scale  ecommerce solution with Magento. Companies that need that level of focus are willing to pay.",1366822878

5602559,comment,5601912,5601912,26,0,jlarocco,,,"I have to say this article really annoyed me.<p>Maybe I read too much into it, but he seems to be snubbing people who take vacation.  I'm glad not vacationing works for him, and it's his life to live, but that's not for everybody.  I wouldn't write an article snubbing people who work all the time, and I don't see why he needs to snub people who take vacation.<p>Second, he seems incredibly proud to be working all the time.  A good portion of the article is basically, ""Hey, check me out!  I'm working all the time!  How cool am I?"".  Get over it.<p>Third, the author has a hugely exaggerated sense of self-importance.  Reading the article, you'd think he's curing cancer and AIDs and cleaning up the environment all at once.  Take this, for example: ""But startups are different.  Startups are a mission; a belief that something impossible is actually possible.  Its being part of a team that is working toward some distant horizon.  Its this competing against the impossible that makes it so much fun.""<p>And what is the distant horizon he's working toward?  From the 42 Floors home page, it's ""The best place to find office space.""  That's the impossible he's making possible?  That's why he's working 100% of the time?  What a joke.",1366822839

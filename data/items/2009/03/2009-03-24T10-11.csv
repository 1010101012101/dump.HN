Where major languages interact, you'll likely get hybrid support languages between.<p>This article confirms for me that dev tools are worth investing time in developing (and crappy is OK); that languages wars in the abstract are pointless, as you can only evaluate language utility with respect to a 1. specific task; and 2. specific users. It's better to ignore anyone who goes on about any particular language being ""better"". Better for <i>what</i>? Better for <i>whom</i>?<p>I found the writing a bit dry; and the in-depth examples were mostly of the languages that the author himself wrote. Although they were successfully adopted for their task, and they are examples he can speak authoritatively about, it's a small sample from which to generalize.",1237892178

And please use encryption appropriately.<p>In the US at least you are dealing with HIPAA which has a deep set of requirements your system will have to meet.<p>And you are dealing with crucial information, if you screw up medical records such that crucial information is left out or garbled or lost you could potentially kill people.<p>So use tools that give you a clear view into the development process and let you track, record and correct the system as you are building it.<p>Use whatever language the team is most familiar with and don't think that any framework will make your work easier unless you already know that framework well.",1237891898

Dishonesty is a losing strategy in the long run, and no one is likely to try it.<p>Furthermore, customers get scared off by contracts that they don't understand, because they could be held to some obnoxious clause that's hidden in there.  Enforcing contracts is inefficient, and we should stop doing it.<p>Is there more to ESR's argument than that?",1237891763

I find it both amusing and mysterious that people here in the U.S. talk about ""community"" so much. I really don't get it.</i><p>Alexis de Tocqueville (1805 to 1859) said in Democracy in America that was one of the characteristics of Americans, to self-organize to help their communities. It still is. This results partly from European persons who had this tendency immigrating to America while other Europeans stayed in Europe.",1237891322

Looking at the diagram, cold water is heat exchanged with the drain water which means it will be heated but to less than what a boiler does.<p>This heated stream is then pumped directly to the shower to be mixed with the boiler water, which should cool it a bit. Anyone else find this odd?<p>Personally I'd redesign the system to put the exchanger upstream of the boiler water inlet which means that the boiler would need to expend less energy to heat the water going to the shower head.",1237890726

Ethically your number 1 issue is security now, and it may be legally also depending upon where you're building this.<p>While a web framework is a great place to start for things like this, I do implore you to keep the medical records that it stores as far away from the Internet as possible, if you can.  At least consult really good security guy if you must have them on the net.<p>Opinions:<p>Both are notionally MVC web packages.<p>* Joomla: Joomla is actually a CMS - and most medical records are text, so - maybe it'd work - but I'd be worried about the burden of the cruft, as well as laying your own security over something that's designed for publishing stuff.  It'll be quick to get something up, though.<p>* Django: You can build any kind of database, CMS or virtually anything you can see on the web in Django - so I'd start there.  Django has usable security out of the box, too.<p>Joomla is PHP and Django is Python, so in the interests of code reuse I'd personally go Django every time.  Some quite big desktop apps are built in Python, so you'd be in good company.",1237890723

I've stayed with many of my family members in different parts of Southern Germany and I find it to be similar.<p>This, contrasts highly with South Africa where the idea of community does not exist.

The idea for that site is it pitches exactly ONE thing with laser focus.  The idea for the advertising campaign was ""Get this in front of technically aware moms, have them blog about it, win"".<p>I received overwhelmingly targeted traffic.  They loved it.  I got plenty of thumbs.  95% of them left within 2 seconds.  The remainder did not give me the blog links I was hoping to get from the experience.<p>I got much, much better results from the concurrent campaign I did on AdWords.  User engagement was much higher (downloads, comments, clickthroughs to my site, time on page, etc).  If you compared prices per interested user (defined as someone who didn't bounce in 2 seconds or less) AdWords was something like a twentieth the price of SU.  And I wasn't even using it for conversion related purposes -- if I had, I think I'd probably have spent about $10,000 on SU for every $25 sale I made.<p>I will not be using SU again for this site this Christmas, or for any of my similar promotions.

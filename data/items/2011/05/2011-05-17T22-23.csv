2558318,comment,2557754,2557997,2,0,lyudmil,,,"Well the weird thing is that in this particular situation, bureaucracy <i>could</i> indeed create some economic value.<p>The current situation is this - we have a financial crisis set off by the collapse of the US housing market (the biggest single market in the world). Because of the financial instruments involved in financing US mortgages from 2002 - 2008 it's difficult for banks to tell how much any of their investments are indeed toxic debt, which means they don't know if they are solvent or not. Furthermore, they know all other banks are in the same situation, which means they are hesitant to lend to other banks, let alone consumers.<p>So, we have a stagnant world economy even though we have production capacity and we have people in need of goods and services, because the money supply is essentially being hoarded by the financial institutions. In this situation the government is the only source of demand left. It could create this demand by investing smartly into infrastructure or paying someone to dig a whole and another person to fill it up. One is clearly better than the other, but in the short term they're both better than austerity.<p>I hope I wasn't unclear. I think it's important that everybody realize this. These people might not have sophisticated reasons to protest austerity, but they are actually correct.<p><i>EDIT</i>: I hate to bitch about being down-voted. Please don't think this is about the karma, but it is disappointing. I think what I wrote clearly adds to the discussion. I suppose it's okay to vote down if you simply disagree, but I spent time constructing a thought-out response and I think at least a discussion of where I got it wrong is in order...",1305673120

People are mainly protesting against bipartidism not addressing the country's problems and working together for the greater good of the country, since they only play dumb and fight childishly.<p>The party in charge hasn't done shit about the whole economic crisis. First they tried to fool the people into thinking there was no crisis. When it was so obvious they couldn't keep lying, they passed some stuff that didn't really address the main problems (rigid two-tier labor market, too much spending on pointless bs, almost no-value added economy, too much regulation, and so on). They prefer to spend their time battling oh-so-important problems as fierce copyright laws or populating our roads with pickpocketing speed traps. Oh yeah right, and wether we should be able to speak to a civil servant in any of our languages (spanish is not the only language spoken in spain, almost every state has its own regional dialect/language, which are for the most part mutually intelligibility, but hey, let's make a big deal out of it anyways, who the fuck would care about easing conditions for the self-employed or the start-ups, right?).<p>The opposition, luckily in such a good place to just play the nice guy part and thus get the job with a few good proposals, are drowned in their own pile of corruption-related shit and instead of making easy proposals to win voters back, they prefer to try countless aggressive ad-hominem attacks against the prime minister and his clique wishfully hoping they'll eventually step down.<p>And while they all are pulling each other's hair as if this were a playground, there's +20% unemployment, +45% unemployment for young spaniards and a whole lot of just plain misery sweeping the country.

Both had a major feature release every 4-6 months with minor releases every month or two. At Piehead, most of our projects are less than 2 months from client sign-off to launch. Based on talking with other developers in the Boston area, these timeframes seemed pretty similar to what they were seeing at start-ups and agencies.<p>I didn't list a huge number of start-ups because I felt the post was getting a bit long and didn't want to jam a bulleted list of start-up names in the middle of the article. There are about 20,000 start-ups listed in the BizSpark directory. Granted, they aren't all web start-ups, but I've only got 5 fingers on one hand and I bet there are more than that in the directory.

In the end, these are just tools and the power comes from what we build with them.<p>You use the phrase ""all evidence is to the contrary"" a lot. If you only see evidence supporting open source tools, you're likely not looking too hard. There are pros and cons to both ecosystems and blindly tying yourself to either one will only hurt you in the long run.

That was that.<p>This summer, I decided I wanted to return to work at Google again, but I had a specific project in mind I wanted to work on.

However, the reasons that make it a good enterprise stack work against it in the startup space.<p>Take the example of a web page returning JSON. In Rails there's a prescribed way to do this. It is generally straight forward and one gets it done literally after 5 minutes of tutorials.<p>In .NET, you have to install the WCF REST stack, learn about endpoints, bindings, the difference between Raw, and wrapped formats, then there are authorization behaviors (tokens, windows integrated etc etc). Mess around with service hosts in IIS and then pray it works. With everything being pluggable, there is no simple prescriptive method to get code working and moving on to the next feature. The stack is so complicated that blog posts even by MS employees contain errors which stay uncorrected. I have spent two days trying to figure out what is the best practice for uploading a large file to a web service and the combination of options are simply bewildering and with so many parts one wonders if it is going to work at all.<p>Now imagine this struggle being repeated in every aspect of your development. You will spend the day stepping through Factories and Hosts and Locators using Reflector.exe before finding the little bit of code that does what you want. Then you swear at MS because it is marked ""internal"" and you can't monkey patch it.<p>This syndrome is in part due to the size of Microsoft. MS would never dare release software that wasn't pluggable because it has a big audience and big audiences want a clear delineation between what is their code and what is maintained by Microsoft. The startup ecosystem just wants to hack code until it works and get things done. No startup developer can really devote the necessary time to the study of large software stacks before sending out a piece of string.<p>MS has done an outstanding back-to-basics job with WebMatrix and its PHP-like simplicity. However, it is still a long way behind in other respect.<p>For example, MS doesn't cultivate a community the way open source projects do. There is no central place to find able consultants, or centralized Planet-style feeds, or given provide a site where users can contribute tutorials. The employees are answering forums in their free time (I saw some post at midnight, and this is devotion, but the msdn forums are literary broken - you can see the answers being doubled up in the rendered page but no one fixes them). The experience simply reeks of helplessness on the poor MS-employees' part because someone else in the company has created such a shitty place for developer interaction.",1305670640

    Bizspark program for a few years, which 
    eliminates most of the startup costs normally 
    associated with employing a .NET framework.
</code></pre>
The problem with BizSpark is that it is a ticking time bomb.<p>When starting a business, you don't really know what will happen in 3 years, but only one thing is certain -- the path to success usually takes more than 3 years.<p>And unless you've got VC money to burn irresponsibly, why build on top of a stack that you'll probably have to replace? Does it provide more value than the alternatives? When it comes to web services, all evidence is to the contrary.<p><pre><code>    At Piehead, we build web applications on a faster 
    pace than almost any startup
</code></pre>
This is an unsupported anecdotal evidence.<p>It also seems incorrect based on the sheer number of businesses I've seen doing kick-ass work with non-MS technologies.<p><pre><code>    programmers start to choose technologies based
    on that cultural perception, rather than focusing 
    on the best approach for the kinds software they 
    want to build
</code></pre>
This implies that .NET is the best approach for certain kinds of software - the article does nothing to name them. Which is IMHO, not the best way to advocate for the usage of .NET.<p>And again, all evidence is to the contrary - most popular web-services online are not built with MS technologies, with a few exceptions that you could count by using the fingers on one hand. And what else, other than ASP.NET-powered web applications? For client-apps targeted to consumers? For mobile apps? Again, all evidence is to the contrary.<p>Besides the price and the interoperability story - another reason would be that Microsoft is currently a follower.<p>Besides a couple of exceptions, which are small in scope, Microsoft currently does nothing but to copy ideas taken from (shock and horror) open-source projects. Sorry, but innovation happens somewhere else.<p>I also like being able to be in control. Even if I don't know the internals of some component I'm using, I like being able getting in touch with the core developers of that component and ask them nicely or pay them directly to fix it for me. And if that component is valuable to me, I also like being able to improve it myself.<p>Open-source gives you that, Microsoft software doesn't.",1305670552

Hugh Hoppes research on vertex cache optimization and SHPRT has been a shipping part of the DirectX SDK for years for example.  Recently MS Research published a paper that greatly reduced Kinect latency that is likely to make its way into games and other applications.<p>I'm not as aware of other research to product transitions, but I imagine a lot of MS research's work has moved to .NET (I think F# might have started as a MS Research project?)  Microsoft Research is one of the strongest divisions right now, they produce a lot of cool stuff, practical or not.",1305669673

To add to this, in the US system:<p>-- the vast majority of bureaucrats with power over the average man are not elected or even subject to firing<p>-- we do not truly have a system of one man/one vote. the guy who writes the new york times  headlines on election day literally controls at least a million votes.<p>-- the candidates who are dubbed ""serious"" by the media are not chosen at random. By any quantitative theory of political voice, that up front winnowing from 300 million to ten or so is more substantive than the election itself.<p>-- in the business sector, power is wielded with far more responsibility. there is a CEO and an identifiable company behind a product, which can go out of business if it displeases its customers, and which is subject to feedback on an instantaneous basis through purchases. by contrast most govt projects are products of committees, with permanent funding and diluted accountability only in the form of the 2-4 year election cycle.<p>in short, voting with your wallet or voting with your feet means far greater efficacy and voice than going through the ceremony of voting with a ballot.<p>-- Rule by an elite is inevitable. The process by which that elite is selected is everything. The US used to be much more aware of this, referring to itself as a ""republic"" rather than a ""democracy"".<p>-- The Chinese model is a lot easier to understand when comparing it to Apple. Should Steve Jobs choose his successor through a plebiscite in which he ostensibly has the same voice as a retail store employee hired yesterday? Or should he choose a leader who he thinks will follow his path? In the latter case legitimacy among Apple employees ultimately rests on the bottom line success of Apple, with the necessary safety valves being exit (freedom to quit) and market (revenue growth) rather than voice (noisily protesting Jobs' successor).<p>In the same way, most Chinese believe that Deng was the best qualified person in China to choose his successor. And legitimacy comes from continually posting solid bottom line numbers, something the US has not done for a while.",1305669664

I had an offer with another great company, and they told me to let them extend it for another week. I did the interview process at Google, and did two phone interviews and one onsite. I thought I did pretty well, but I was waiting for their reply back for a week, and no reply. Then I pinged them, they apologized and said they are waiting for references. I pinged them again for another week, no reply yet. Then I accepted the other job because Google's Hiring process sucks so much, that it tells you right there that they don't care about their employees. I spent time out of my own work life to do interviews, and they can't bother to email us in the recommended timeframe. They said within 4 days, but 14 days ...

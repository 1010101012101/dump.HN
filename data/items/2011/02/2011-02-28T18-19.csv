2272341,comment,2270466,2272062,0,0,tel,,,"Apologies there, I was reacting to the exaggerated choice in anecdote, but actually meant the ""practical"" line favorably. Science and practicality can be at ends, but at the end, practicality wins by definition, right?<p>3. I agree that complex model building is fertile ground for hand-waving, this-is-too-complex-to-understand-so-just-accept-it false justification. I don't think large models are endemic to either Bayesian or Frequentist methods, though Bayesian methods do allow them to be built more easily. In both cases, I think simple sanity checks form a foundation that is necessary for the presentation of complex models.<p>1. I think the idea of being ""interested in results"" is a false hope. Experimentation does not always produce results, and when it does you probably don't even need statistics because the results are so obvious. In all other cases, uncertainty has become a major factor and demanding clarity is foolish. Tempting, but foolish.<p>4. I think under-modeling is dangerous, too. At the very least, it can rob you of the ability to quantify educated conclusions short of doing meta-analysis. At least with priors you're telling everyone you're a bit tipsy instead of stamping a bar chart down and having people  swallow assumptions under the stamp of 'objectivity'.<p>It's kind of like Python 'import this'. Explicit is better.",1298919373

You do this most often by a likelihood ratio test: you divide the probability of data given null hypothesis by the probability of data given alternative model, and then you compare the value of the negative log of the resulting ratio to an expected distribution of said statistic assuming the alternative model is false and taking into account degrees of freedom (how many more parameters the alternative model contains). If it turns out that, under the null hypothesis, the probability of the ratio statistic being larger or equal to the one at hand is <= 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. The alternative hypothesis <i>is not automatically</i> accepted yet but it is said to explain the data better than the null model.<p>Basically everything you wrote is correct, it's just that I misinterpreted what you referred to as ""model"" to mean ""alternative model,"" while you actually meant ""null hypothesis"" or ""null model.""

2272185,comment,2271287,2272074,0,0,jessriedel,,,"When trying to find out how an object is going to interact with the electromagnetic field, it's generally useful to decompose the charge distributed on the object into ""multipole modes"".  It turns out that any arbitrary distribution of charges can be expressed as a sum of such multipoles, and the interaction of each multipole with the E&M field can be solved even though the object itself may be too complicated.  Usually, only the first few multipoles are important, which allows efficient computation of the objects behavior by summing up the contribution of the first few multipoles.<p>The first multipole (""monopole"") is just the net charge of the object.  The second multipole (""dipole"") is the degree to which the object has positive charge distributed toward one side and negative charge toward another.<p>A single isolated point charge is a perfect monopole, with zero higher-order multipole components.  An object composed of two opposite charges of equal magnitude, separated by a distance, is a perfect dipole, with zero monopole and higher-order multipole components.  And so on.<p>Apparently, the point is that objects which are electromagnetically simple (such as a single point charge) cannot be pulled by a tractor beam.  Instead, the object must be complicated such that it has several large multipole components which interact in the right ways to produce a net pull.",1298917192

I think VZW uses a system like this where they can push contacts to a new phone if you lose your old one?<p>My vote is yes, keep doing this.  I love that Android currently gives me the option of saving to the phone or to my SIM card, something like this I would most definitely use.<p>Here's one question: if you continue this, will there be plans to export this data in a human readable, highly portable format?  i.e. synchronization with an email application like outlook or Thunderbird?<p>I hope more people see this post, I nearly skipped it since it was on the bottom of the ""new"" page.

Both of these together make the whole enterprise of web development burn up far more time than is reasonable. What makes this even worse is that the w3c doesn't bother to step up and make clear the ambiguities of how CSS SHOULD BE interpreted. They're in a perfect position as an arbiter of correctness, but they squander that power and are content to leave everything up to variable interpretation.<p>Sure, there are frameworks that abstract away the bullshit of CSS, but these are the result of COUNTLESS wasted hours of suffering that have propelled people to create layers of tooling for something that could have been VASTLY more simple in the first place.",1298916233

These kinds of rants usually come from programmers who don't want to take the time to understand how CSS works, and when it doesn't ""just work"" the way they expect, they blame CSS. That said, CSS definitely needs improvement. I hope the flexible box model gains traction. I find that to be a more natural way to lay out pages, although the syntax seems a little clumsy.",1298916212

That's Compass/Blueprint.<p>Complaining about CSS is like complaining that the register names in x86 assembly have too many 'e's and 'x's in them. Don't write CSS; write something that compiles down to it. People argued about macro assemblers. Then they argued about C compilers. Then they argued about high level languages. People are always going to argue with replacements to technologies they've grown expert in. That doesn't mean you have to listen to them.",1298916017

As of now it&#x27;s somewhat messy and requires lot&#x27;s of manual tweaks besides changing the DPI.<p>See <a href=""https://community.kde.org/KDE/High-dpi_issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://community.kde.org/KDE/High-dpi_issues</a><p>However one should be careful when getting monitors with such huge resolution since they put more requirements on the GPU. For example if you want to play games in native, it will require dual GPU at least which is a very pricey overkill otherwise. Current video cards don&#x27;t cope with such resolution well yet. That besides the fact that such monitors are very expensive on their own.<p>Also, ergonomics wise, for me personally 24-27&quot; is a sweep spot. Anything larger than that becomes uncomfortable to use unless you place it in some distance.",1418583599

I&#x27;m actually quite impressed with some of the problem types that show up in more advanced mathematics lessons on Khan Academy that go beyond the eighth grade level implied by current United States curriculum standards.</i><p>Thank you.<p>> <i>Common Core, and good mathematics curricular around the world, expect reasoning and explanation from pupils in mathematics lessons already at elementary school age. That currently is indeed difficult to automate.</i><p>This is definitely true. By no means is Khan Academy a complete solution for mathematics instruction, nor is it likely to become one in the next few years. Our site should ideally be used alongside other materials that test reasoning and explanation in a non-automated way, as well as projects that allow students to apply their knowledge. We have early experiments that take a much more interactive approach to teaching certain concepts and encourage more experimentation, but we&#x27;re probably years away from developing them into a shipping product.<p>> <i>The author&#x27;s comments on development of Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBC) as a new platform of online mathematics instruction is of course especially interesting. I will be curious to see how this program continues to develop, and I would be glad to hear from developers of that program in this thread too.</i><p>If I&#x27;m not mistaken, many of the SBAC problems (especially free-response ones) are hand-graded, which can work if you charge for each test taken, but can&#x27;t work for us when we have millions of problems done every day, all graded automatically. That said, we&#x27;re exploring strategies like peer grading in other subject areas (particularly our programming curriculum) and would be excited to bring them to math as well.",1418583598

The size and weight of an air-breathing system will be lower due to greatly increased Isp of the 1st stage, the largest stage by mass.<p>A smaller 1st stage fuel tank might mean that heat-shielding or higher temp materials is more of an option, which means you can raise the 1st stage separation velocity closer to what is &quot;optimum&quot; in the rocket sense and still recover the 1st stage.  This puts the 2nd stage closer to <i>its</i> natural optimum design point.<p>Overall size might not be a show-stopping problem now, but for building space colonies or Mars missions, overall vehicle size <i>does</i> eventually become concerning.  Think of trying to build a jig to friction-stir weld a 180m long, 14m wide fuel tank.

In theory, this should be possible. My employers might agree to this (they do it to other colleagues of mine in different countries). However, the taxation laws in India are not straight forward around this. You can explore to see if this is a legit option for you. If you have a solid profile as in open source contributions and you can pull off working remotely (definitely not easy), this is the most lucrative option for you. Trust me, living in USA is not what it used to be. The whole political climate with so many wars, government snooping, highly variant economy and things like Ferguson make it less attractive. If I were considering a move today, I&#x27;d definitely think 10 times. Plus the stress levels here are amazingly high. Everyone seems to be lost in their &quot;careers&quot;.

8749103,comment,8747521,8748343,0,0,fab13n,,,"Your comment addresses many things at once, some insightful, others more botched IMO. However I find them wrong in a very interesting way, so let me try to counter them.<p>First, seeing &quot;programming&quot; as a generalised activity is barely more accurate than bundling &quot;doing stuff in front of a screen and keyboard&quot; together. You wouldn&#x27;t bundle together writing a novel and doing mechanical simulations on Mapple, would you? Same for programming. More specifically, the intersection between fun+unpaid open-source programming and corporate programming is tiny. Nobody&#x27;s going to write an open-source SAP module for fun. As for big, strategic open-source projects, they have their many unfunny parts done by employees, who typically work for companies who want to commoditize something on their vertical market, by enabling an open-source product.<p>I do hack some stuff for fun, some others for money. I reasonably often manage to write fun stuff for money, and sometimes I even get to open-source it. But my open-source programming? I do that because it&#x27;s more fun than _World of Warcraft_ or TV watching in my twisted mind; it has little to do with my job (most of the time, and unfortunately).<p>The &quot;I&#x27;m no Senior Software Architect I&#x27;m just a coder&quot; thing: OK I&#x27;m guilty of that one, but it&#x27;s no modesty, it&#x27;s just instinctive rejection towards a corporate system we often despise. We have a urge to reject the Dilbert ladder, the way you might reject a medal proposal from a country / organization whose ethics you condemn. Think of the people who declined the Nobel prize, nobody ever believe anyone did that out of modesty. An important point of yours still stands though: not playing along with the corporate charade is going to hurt most of those who indulge in it, in the long term.<p>About ageism, and as a not-so-young person anymore: when you age, you get a broader picture of what you work on, and why, while you lose some sharpness, most notably in speed of learning. This broader view has some value for the company, but only as long as it comes with some managerial skills: your better synthetic view is of no value, if you can&#x27;t effectively share it with others. Your caricatural Aspergerish programmer doesn&#x27;t have the interpersonal skills required to transform the insights of maturity into value for a company, and that kind of person is over-represented among the people who still call themselves &quot;coders&quot; when they hit 40. Successful mature hackers hide under other titles, in companies.<p>As for the &quot;everyone can be a programmer&quot;, I don&#x27;t remember having ever witnessed that, quite the opposite. Actually, I&#x27;m here because a decade ago, I enjoyed reading some smug essays, from some openly elitist guy who was trying to figure out what made hackers such special bunch ;-)<p>About the dangers of boot camps: if you need to teach someone how to program, he won&#x27;t be serious competition for any hacker. You&#x27;d have to teach a hacker how _not_ to program. Cue that famous story about Mozart [<a href=""http://betweenletters.quora.com/Mozart-How-Do-You-Write-a-Symphony"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betweenletters.quora.com/Mozart-How-Do-You-Write-a-Sy...</a>]. OTOH, H1B might be more of an issue, I don&#x27;t know. Sure it&#x27;s cheaper competition; but what makes the Silicon Valley such a wealth generator is a critical mass of smart people. It might well be that allowing a thousand super-smart foreigners creates interesting jobs for hundreds of thousands of merely-smart Americans?<p>About programmers being typically unsavvy with politics and human relationships, there sure is a strong correlation here. Not being American, I don&#x27;t understand why you typically despise unions more than the other lobbies which serve wealthier interests, but I can see the savviness in avoiding a name that triggers knee-jerk reactions in many voters.<p>So, back to the core argument: why don&#x27;t we organize into unions, optionally under a less unamerican name? An issue is that many of the smarter programmers already have a fun job at a decent pay. In Europe, they also typically enjoy a healthy life/work balance, but the American relationship with &quot;work ethics&quot; is yet another thing I won&#x27;t pretend to understand. Anyway, when you have fun doing something you&#x27;re good at, you aren&#x27;t tempted to enter a field you neither like nor master, such as politics, be it the genuine or the corporate kind.<p>And why aren&#x27;t we typically good at it? Well, we typically enjoy deterministic things with explicit rules, like computers and unlike politics. We also typically can and love to fit complex models in our minds all at once, to design and debug them; I guess it often comes with a solipsist / introvert character.<p>Would I want a programmers&#x27; union? I&#x27;m not sure. I fear that it would favor a bureaucratized view of development, and suck the fun out of the job. I navigate the anarchic development job market just fine the current way, favoring what I personally care about (lots of from-scratch / exploratory developments, moderate workload, mutual trust with my hierarchy). I don&#x27;t want to think of my job as a permanent struggle against my nasty overlords, the way automobile workers seem to experience their workday. But sure, there needs to be someone to kick the companies&#x27; asses when they implement no-poaching cartels.",1418582604

I do suspend when I take a short break. Congrats on the fast boot time without systemd, but it&#x27;s not the easiest way :-) My systemd starts a minimal debian testing in 700 ms.

That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life, because I know and love the person who did that.

Medical doctors who work in emergency rooms have more been-there, done-thats on this issue than I have.<p>On a statistical, national population level, it does appear that alcohol (legal but regulated) is more dangerous to more people than LSD (currently basically illegal). But individual personal risk profiles vary, and I would not want LSD (for example) to be more readily available to the general public than the typical prescription medicine. If a knowledgeable physician prescribes LSD for an indication for which LSD is generally safe and effective, then fine, but I hope nobody I hope to see live a long and healthy life is obtaining LSD from current &quot;street&quot; dealers or &quot;friends.&quot;<p>On the broader topic of drug regulation, there does appear to be some cross-national evidence to suggest that &quot;decriminalization&quot; (which is not the same thing as &quot;legalization&quot;) may help set up systems of drug regulation that actually reduce societal use of dangerous drugs, which sounds like a very good idea to me.

I have no inside knowledge of Khan Academy’s operations or vision.&quot; Actually, here on Hacker News we have had public discussions blessed with direct participation by Khan Academy developers, so I think I have some sense of what Khan Academy intends to do as it continues to develop online lessons. I&#x27;ve even had some off-site email interaction with Khan Academy developers after threads here in which I have &quot;met&quot; them while we discuss our common interest in mathematics education. I certainly hope that Khan Academy staff will join the discussion of this post.<p>The author also writes, &quot;I find it more likely that Khan Academy’s exercise set draws an accurate map of the strengths and weaknesses of education technology in 2014. Khan Academy asks students to solve and calculate so frequently, not because those are the mathematical actions mathematicians and math teachers value most, but because those problems are easy to assign with a computer in 2014.&quot; I think this statement is correct. The Khan Academy developers have devoted a lot of thought to how to computerize problems rather than exercises, and they are still working on building new problem types for the mathematics lessons. I&#x27;m actually quite impressed with some of the problem types that show up in more advanced mathematics lessons on Khan Academy that go beyond the eighth grade level implied by current United States curriculum standards. But the author&#x27;s point is well taken that the Common Core, and good mathematics curricula around the world, expect reasoning and explanation from pupils in mathematics lessons already at elementary school age. That currently is indeed difficult to automate.<p>The author&#x27;s comments on development of Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBC) as a new platform of online mathematics instruction is of course especially interesting. I will be curious to see how this program continues to develop, and I would be glad to hear from developers of that program in this thread too.<p>(Disclosure: I am a teacher of voluntary-participation prealgebra mathematics classes to advanced pupils of third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade age, using the Art of Problem Solving prealgebra textbook by Rusczyk, Patrick, and Boppana as a core text with many supplementary materials from around the world. I do not view Khan Academy as a competitor to my classes, but rather as a helpful supplement for many mathematics learners around the world. My daughter, who is of a younger age than eighth-grade age, is currently doing many of the same Khan Academy lessons as those just reviewed by the blog post author. I recommend Khan Academy to my friends, and it will probably stay in the mix for the mathematics studies of my three minor children for quite a few years yet.)",1418581028

8748997,comment,8747935,8748395,0,0,TylerJay,,,"While I expect the death rate of psychedelics/hallucinogens to be much, <i>much</i> lower than that of alcohol, it should be noted that the analysis you presented here doesn&#x27;t really provide solid evidence that it is so.<p>Given that an average LSD dose is 50-150mcg and because of the &quot;Cascade effect&quot; nature of the drug, LSD is often not measurable in the blood even when someone is heavily under the influence. And even in the cases where it <i>would</i> be detectable if they tested for it, LSD is not included in coroners&#x27; postmortem tox-screens unless it is specifically suspected. Movies and TV get this wrong frequently.<p>Basically, I&#x27;m saying that since it isn&#x27;t routinely tested for (and is often undetectable anyway) the published statistics have no reason to be accurate.<p>But really, how much more common (even after adjusting for frequency of overall usage) are &quot;Hey, watch this. Hold my beer&quot; deaths than any deaths from LSD? My estimate is &quot;a lot.&quot;",1418580704

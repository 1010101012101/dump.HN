It&#x27;s stuff the junior guy on the team learns in his first few months.<p>Moreover, I think there is a reasonable argument that of your chosen examples, testing is the only one that has sufficiently common requirements for building large but general tools to be worthwhile. The other design principles are valuable, but how best to use them will be highly project-specific, and therefore any widely useful framework will tend to be over-engineered and over-generalised for most applications. See also the Java nightmare I mentioned previously, the trend toward lightweight frameworks on the server side, etc.<p>Edited to add:<p><i>The myth that front-end developers are not &quot;necessarily from a programming background&quot; is poisonous thinking and it unfortunately usually comes from older programmers or non-front-end developers; the very people who could help guide the front-end world into maturity.</i><p>There <i>is</i> a difficulty in the industry that significant numbers of people are coming into this kind of front-end development from some sort of HTML/CSS and/or design background. They used to use a bit of JS here and there that they copied off a demo site to get their buttons to animate, and now they&#x27;re being asked to move into more of a mainstream programming role, but neither they nor the people asking them necessarily appreciate what that involves.<p>That&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s fault. It will be fixed over time as the industry matures, both because knowledge will spread and because more specialised roles than &quot;front end developer&quot; will probably evolve. But right now, today, it <i>is</i> the situation in large parts of the industry.",1389974152

Why? Because no matter how great a company is, if you&#x27;re an employee, you&#x27;re still just an employee.

A parallel argument against writing the Bill Of Rights was that it was completely redundant: every enumerated right was <i>already</i> protected by the <i>limited</i> granting of powers to the government. Remember, the US government starts as nothing and is <i>granted</i> highly restricted powers (not the imposition of limits on an otherwise unlimited government, as most seem to think). There are plenty of other rights, regardless of enumeration, which likewise the government is not authorized to limit.<p>The problem is there&#x27;s an overlooked difference between <i>positive</i> rights vs <i>negative</i> rights. Positive rights, enacted by legislation, require others to facilitate one&#x27;s actions. Negative rights, requiring no legislation save for active protection thereof, require nothing more from others than benign neglect. The whole premise of the US Constitution is full recognition of negative rights: lawmakers <i>are not empowered to hinder anyone&#x27;s actions beyond a small and specific delegation of powers</i>, much less compel others to facilitate someone&#x27;s alleged positive right.<p>The &quot;create new rights based on their personal conceptions&quot; you worry about are wholly positive rights, anathema to the Constitution and core American principles because they are based on compulsion of others to facilitate that new legislated/adjudicated &quot;right&quot;. Rights, as understood in the Constitution, are nothing more than people doing what they see fit so long as others are not wronged in the process, and the legislative & judicial processes exist solely to identify & resolve these conflicts when they do arise.",1389973998

We started out with OsC, played with Magento, and saw, 8 years ago, that the strategy of these platforms was, well, broken.<p>How? Well. Let&#x27;s consider the typical scenario. Joe sells kites. Joe wants a website that helps him sell kites. Magento looks like it does what he wants, as it&#x27;s got a cart and all that stuff. Joe finds a contractor who looks good, and has decent references from his current clients. They start work. Part way through the build, Joe realises that he wants to sell custom-printed kites, and to do this, he needs to take a deposit, and then charge the customer the balance. &quot;Uh-oh&quot;, thinks the developer, &quot;I&#x27;m on fixed costs, and there&#x27;s no plugin for that. The architecture is a nightmare... screw it, I&#x27;ll just chuck it in the core and worry about it later&quot;. Joe is happy, as his site does what he needs it to, and the developer is happy because he got paid.<p>Six months later, Joe reads about a security update, and wants to apply it. His developer sucks his teeth, and applies it, manually re-patching in his previous hack, because making a plugin is hard, m&#x27;kay (never mind that in many scenarios, you <i>can&#x27;t</i> make a plugin to make whatever you need to happen, happen). Joe wants another addition, and another hack is born.<p>This cycle continues for a while, until the developer fears looking at Joe&#x27;s code-base, and Joe is pissed off that everything takes a long time, and that upgrades can&#x27;t be done/take forever, because the developer is having to re-implement, and re-implement, and re-implement, rather than move forwards.<p>The other side of this is that a magento install will run a magento site - not ten, not two on different databases, and no mix-and-match of either, meaning that you end up with a whole bunch of code-bases, many of which differ, even if you&#x27;re a shop exclusively running magento for your N clients.<p>It&#x27;s not clear who Magento is built for. It&#x27;s not for developers, as it&#x27;s painful to work with... it&#x27;s not for the end user, as the front-end experience is so-so at best, and again, hard to customise without screwing up upgradability... and it&#x27;s definitely not for the merchant, as it&#x27;s featureless, barren, slow, and ultimately expensive to run.<p>So what we did was build an eCommerce platform where everything is extensible and overridable. Core method doesn&#x27;t quite do what you want? Not a problem, write a client-specific one, just keep your interfaces consistent, and you won&#x27;t break maintainability. You can upgrade the core with impunity. You can hang as many sites as you can grind out off a single install. We deploy continuously.<p>As a result, we&#x27;ve been able to focus on building features marketeers and merchandisers want, by being able to build something once, respond quickly to market and client demands, and roll it out widely with minimal effort - rather than being stuck on the terminal treadmill of broken upgrade paths.",1389972287

The solution was not deploying twice but telling the `.(js|coffee).erb` file with the asset_url links which partials it depended on (this seems like it should be unnecessary and handled automatically simply by using asset_url but it isn&#x27;t).<p>The `//= depends_on` directive handles this for you. You can read the issue I filed here for more information: <a href""https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/issues/9"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/issues/95</a>. From the issue it looks like they are working on improving this too.<p>We also started out with the more granular module design recommended here but actually found it cumbersome. I recalled over-modularity also being problematic when I used to do .NET. I&#x27;ve found (as have many others I talk to) that most projects should just have a &quot;core&quot; (for services, shared directives and controllers) and &quot;UI&quot; (mostly controllers and application specific directives).<p>In our project we have a &quot;core&quot; which is mostly services and directives and then we break up the rest of the application into separate &quot;app&quot; or &quot;UI&quot; modules which depend on that, these are mostly just controllers. We&#x27;ll only create other modules if there is an obvious reason to break them out. The easy test is would you package the module up and let it live in it&#x27;s own repository (maybe as a bower package) in the future. If in doubt, it goes in core.<p>Another thing that helped a lot was switching to using <a href""http://rails-assets.or"" rel""nofollo"">http://rails-assets.org</a>. This made bower integration of 3rd party dependencies far, far, easier.<p>I have not had speed problems with Sprockets yet though I&#x27;ve run into them in the past. We are even passing our bower assets through Sprockets so I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s running well. I suppose this could be a version thing (we&#x27;re using Rails 4).<p>Finally we use Teaspoon to run our tests and I don&#x27;t bother with AngularJS style integration tests, we test our services mostly and avoid browser automation based testing right now. It is generally cumbersome, slow and unreliable. We try to keep as much logic in the services anyways.<p>All-in-all, I second the sentiment that using AngularJS with Rails has been great and I actually really like Sprockets/Asset Pipeline for working with it.",1389972182

It is entirely up to you; actually, it has only ever been you, because it is you that rolls out of bed early to bring it. No one is going to do that for you. If you want to do it, then you will figure out a way to make it happen.<p>Like some of you, I have a family. That makes things a bit challenging at times, and you will likely have to work even harder to find the time, to make the space, so that you can bring it. And, I will add, those that are parents, this is a great example to set for your children. You want to be, &quot;The Daddy that brings it.&quot; You want to be, &quot;The Mommy that brings it.&quot; Because, you want to instill in them that they can, too. It&#x27;s a valuable life-lesson. In turn, it is psychologically healthy for you as well, to know that you are a parent that is firing on all cylinders. In addition, it is incredibly gratifying when your child sees your work. &quot;Wow... that&#x27;s the new game that you&#x27;re working on!

Watch a mason build a wall one day. You will observe that he or she lays one brick at a time.<p>This is how you have to view your project. Sure, it would be amazing to have an entire day, every day to devote to your project. However, the reality is that most of us simply do not have that luxury. So, strive to think of it as a mason: lay one brick at a time, and eventually the wall will be built. Every character that you type into Xcode, Visual Studio, etc. turns into a keyword, a variable name, etc... that subsequently turns into a line. Those lines build up, day by day, and before you know it, you have a program, and you look back and think, &quot;Wow, why did I ever think I could not finish?&quot;<p>Also, let go of &quot;Internet Time.&quot; That is to say, we all read HN and see these impressive &quot;Show HN&quot; posts, and submitted stories about the Next Big Thing... and it seems like things are happening so fast, and we think, &quot;Why even try?&quot; Well, the reality is nothing is happening fast. It is an illusion. Most all of these stories have an incredible amount of time and work behind them, so let go of that illusion, get started, and stay focused.<p><i>&quot;There&#x27;s only this moment and the next moment.

We are all struggling in some way, whether it be through failure, health issues, personal issues, family issues, etc. No one is immune from the grip of suffering through his or her struggles.<p>You are not alone.<p>Embrace the grind.

I&#x27;m failing. I&#x27;m not motivated. I can&#x27;t finish.&quot;<p>The clock is ticking for all of us... fight! You never know where your work will take you.

They take peoples&#x27; opinions and petty desires (such as business requirements and deadlines that are arbitrary) and assume them to be objective truth. I worked at a startup that was cargo-culting Scrum (badly) and people started talking about &quot;Iterations&quot; as if they existed objectively and had real, phallic, meaning. They don&#x27;t.<p>Engineers insist on truth and struggle with the fact that most people who succeed in human affairs are extremely dishonest.<p>&quot;Shortage&quot; just means, &quot;we can&#x27;t hire talent at as low a wage as we&#x27;d like to pay&quot;. It is not an objective condition. It might qualify as a true shortage if companies were reducing the pay of executives and non-techs to make space for engineers, but that is happening almost nowhere.",1389970958

As a middle name, I named my 1-year-old after Countess Ada of Lovelace in order to encourage her to view computer science as a positive, welcoming field.<p>Try explaining to a 15-year-old or 21-year-old woman why the presence of booth babes shouldn&#x27;t impact their choice of a career.  In an industry with an overwhelmingly male population, with a (deserved) reputation for cultural quirks that tend to follow those of adolescent males, and few widely acknowledged and celebrated female successes, the contextual message of booth babes is pretty clear. And that message, based on the evidence, is: your gender is not welcomed here.<p>I know you believe that your private pleasures have no public impact -- you enjoy booth babes, so what&#x27;s the problem?<p>I&#x27;d say the problem is that my goals are different from yours.<p>I don&#x27;t think a professional event should appeal to the sexuality of either gender, and should support the professional development of both.<p>I don&#x27;t think your private, personal enjoyments have all that much relevance to the success of the industry as a whole.<p>I don&#x27;t think waving off the high turn-off value of this marketing mechanism is warranted on the facts.<p>And I don&#x27;t think, in an industry that prides itself on being rational, scientific, and logical, that booth babes reflect well on the marketing choices or expenditures of our industry&#x27;s leaders.<p>With our different goals, we will come to different conclusions.

This is simpy to confirm that you are the owner of your e-mail address (we are sending an automated registration email afterwards). In addition, you can give a small profile which will make the UI a little more user friendly (profile image, etc.). This is also transferred to our server. However, this is completly optional and is currently not used anywhere. We may offer some collaboration features in the future, but this will also be opt-in to share your profile.<p>Besides that, we only log some serious errors which occur in our runtime, but we never send any data of your inbox out!

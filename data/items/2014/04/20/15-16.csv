7617221,comment,7615567,7615567,11,0,RogerL,,,"I went to an engineering University. Besides having a wide variety of math required (3 semesters of Calc, 1 semester of either stats or probability, 1 semester of either linear algebra or matrices), we also had to take 3 semesters of physics, and 2 of chemistry. Most of us (those not just looking for a piece of paper) went considerable deeper in at least one area.<p>No, you don&#x27;t need to understand organic chemistry to write a CRUD app. But, you don&#x27;t need university to write a CRUD app.<p>I think I received an excellent education that prepared me for about any job out there. And, I&#x27;ve done it. I&#x27;ve done cancer statistics for the NIH. I&#x27;ve worked in avionics and simulation. Well, blah blah, no one cares about my resume, I&#x27;ll just say I couldn&#x27;t have done any of it without the education I received. I haven&#x27;t done financial quant stuff, as an example, but how could I without the math background? Or how could I program a controller in a factory without understanding PID (done that)? How can I get a piece of that neat drone project (done that)? Hey, that computer vision stuff looks interesting, all I need to know is ...derivatives, statistics (done that too).<p>For most of us, university is the last and/or best chance to really understand how the world works. For that you need quite a bit of math and science. Another example. We have a voluntary Arduino robotics workshop going on at work, coupled with 3D printing. Naturally, people are excited, and have all kinds of ideas. But, how do you execute on that if you don&#x27;t understand how to design an op amp circuit, or filter data with something more sophisticated than a moving average? Robotics spans a number of fields, and to actually produce something more than a gimmick requires a lot of knowledge. Knowledge that you can pretty easily pick up in University, but knowledge you mostly just long for as you have to rush home at 5:30 to pick up the kids and make dinner.<p>I guess this is a cranky rant from an old guy. But I hear about University programs that are nothing more than Java voc ed systems and I despair. $100K in debt to learn something most anyone on here could just pick up on their own. You don&#x27;t need university for that stuff.",1398009551

And you know what that led to.<p>When he claimed that the mean old gays were bullying poor Brendan Eich, and his friend Russell Nelson took up and defended his argument, it made me recognize a pattern that explains their motivation very well:<p>Eric Raymond and Russell Nelson and Brendan Eich all served as the head of major free open source software companies: Eric Raymond was the first president of the Open Source Initiative, Russell Nelson was the second taking over when he resigned, and then resigned himself shortly thereafter, and Brendan Eich was CEO of Mozilla.<p>All three of them made bigoted statements and performed bigoted actions, and as a consequence of their own speech and actions, and of their high visibility leadership positions of free open source companies, they each felt compelled to resign from their jobs, and now feel very sorry for themselves because of how other people reacted, not because of how they acted.<p>It&#x27;s disgusting how Eric and Russell are now whining about the mean &quot;intolerant gay bullies&quot; who didn&#x27;t respect Brendan&#x27;s right to be intolerant of oppressed minorities. They&#x27;re just projecting from their own experiences as ousted bigots. The mean old community just couldn&#x27;t tolerate their bigoted divisive beliefs which were embarrassing and damaging the free open source software movement.<p>Russell Nelson goes as far as to disagree with Karl Popper and other philosophers about The Paradox of Tolerance, which states that it&#x27;s justified to be intolerant of tolerance: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance</a> -- Russell argues that it&#x27;s &quot;baby thinking&quot; to &quot;tolerate everything but intolerance&quot;:\n<a href=""http://blog.russnelson.com/politics/tolerating-intolerance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.russnelson.com/politics/tolerating-intolerance.h...</a><p>That&#x27;s their standard operating procedure, of ignoring criticism and calling their critics names instead of responding with logical arguments. So Karl Popper is a baby thinker in Russell Nelson&#x27;s mind.<p>So naturally Raymond and Nelson both feel sorry for Eich. They&#x27;re birds of a feather, cut from the same cloth: they all lay down with the same dogs, and wake up with the same fleas.<p>So what does it say about Eich that two of his most sympathetic and vocal defenders were also kicked out of their leadership positions in a Free Open Source Software company, because of divisiveness and bigotry, just like he was?<p>Eric Raymond and Russell Nelson are far beyond redemption. And Brendan Eich finally put himself into the same boat as they are, and it&#x27;s all his own damn fault, so of course those guys are his biggest advocates and defenders, and they all deserve each other.<p>And now Eich&#x27;s legacy is not just tarnished by his donation to support Proposition 8, but by the fact that two of the most notorious douchebag in the free open source software community have come out of the woodwork screeching a full throated defense of him.<p>I think it&#x27;s wonderful that the community refused to be led or fooled by people like them, who would pay money to make TV commercials demonizing gays and destroying sex marriages, or race bait and call the victims of their own bigotry bullies for standing up for themselves and exercising their right to free speech.",1398009460

7617209,comment,7613566,7614425,2,0,krschultz,,,"My guess is because the decision is made at a high level that a whole project is to be killed, and in order to keep that decision compartmentalized the decision is made to lay off the entire staff rather than bringing in mid-level managers to make decisions on who should stay and who should go, which would probably cause the news to leak early.<p>It also makes it a bit better for the laid-off employees. If you keep 50% and fire 50%, the ones that got let go have a much harder sell to their next employer. If you can shrug it off and say &#x27;the whole project got canceled&#x27;, no negativity is cast on that particular employee.<p>There is also some HR/legal things related to the difference between eliminating positions and firing people. It is easier to claim that the positions are eliminated if you axe the whole project.<p>Then what typically happens swiftly after the lay off is the company offers to re-hire the best performers from that team immediately. I have seen that in 20 person startups and 100,000 person companies.<p>The whole thing is always ugly. In my mind the worst part is when a company heavily recruits a top performer from elsewhere in the company or externally to come work on this project when it is 80% of the way to the cliff, generally by mis-representing the situation, and then axes the whole thing 3 months later. I have seen many people burned by that scenario.",1398009432

What Stalin and others did not appreciate is that the free market produces a &quot;hidden order&quot;, which was understood by many 18th and 19th century economists. Another major error of the era was the belief that central planning of an economy - socialism - could replace capitalism. There was a major debate at the time, now known as the economic calculation debate[1], between socialist economists Harold Laski and Oscar Lange on the one hand and liberal economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek on the other. In the 20&#x27;s Mises had made the stunning argument that allocation of capital was impossible without the price function that is inherent to the capitalist system[2]. Laski and Lange obviously disagreed and provided the socialist counter argument. It was many years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, that socialist philosopher and historian Robert Heilbroner admitted in the New Yorker &quot;It turns out, of course, that Mises was right. The Soviet system has long been dogged by a method of pricing that produced grotesque misallocations of effort&quot;.[3] Still, many do not understand or appreciate the importance of economic calculation and the price function in the rational allocation of capital, which has implications not only for states, but for corporations[4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://mises.org/econcalc.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mises.org/econcalc.asp</a><p>[3] Reflections after communism, Robert Heilbroner (apologies to those without a subscription) <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1990/09/10/1990_09_10_091_TNY_CARDS_000357236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1990/09/10/1990_09_10_091_T...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/rae9_2_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/rae9_2_1.pdf</a>",1398008623

Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have a secretary or a girlfriend so ultimately this responsibility falls on me and I hoping to make it as easy, fun and functional as possible.<p>It&#x27;s also a multi-merchant marketplace, so if other designers are interested they can open a store profile and sell their cards within the app.  It&#x27;s web based, and cards are sent via text message or email. You can also add a photo and personal message to every card before it is sent.<p>I&#x27;m using Braintree to process my payments and I just moved the app to Rackspace.<p>This is a small part of a bigger product idea, and hopefully in the next week or so I&#x27;ll add a couple other features to make the cards more gift like in nature.  Hopefully these features will help distinguish me from the other online greeting card apps already in existence.<p>Thanks for your time.  Any feedback is much appreciated.<p>https://happyfnny.com",1398008292

TVs possess none of these attributes.&#x27;<p>Each of these statements could equally apply to TVs (except, possibly, portability) and the fact that they haven&#x27;t is merely circumstantial.<p>Yes, for the first 50 years of television&#x27;s existence people tended to keep the same TV around for half a decade or more. But that&#x27;s because fundamental changes happened between fifteen and thirty years apart - the switch from black and white to color, then the switch from broadcast to cable and satellite. The rate of innovation, and thus the turnover rate of individual devices, is increasing - just like with the telephone, which remained basically the same for the first several decades of its existence as well, until modern computer technology was invented.<p>Come to think of it the same thing is possibly true of desktop computers. My family was on the same computer between 1984/85  and 1993 - a Mac 512k. Then in 1994 or 95 we got a Performa 475. That lasted for about 5 years until I got a Mac clone - a Motorola Starmax 3000, which had a PowerPC processor. This laster about 2 -3 years. Then I built my first PC - that lasted for about two years. And each year since then I&#x27;ve used the same computer for 1 to 2 years at a time. The turnover period halved exponentially as computers got more and more sophisticated.",1398008291

There are a variety of areas where there can be considerable stream lining or reduction to the net benefit of all parties involved.<p>That said, the myoelectric device at a minimum falls under some level of regulation since it is a biopotential device. The moment you start measuring potentials on the human body, you add the risk of injecting current across the human body - obviously bad. If you wanted to ensure that the myoelectric device was safe, you would at a minimum ensure that a) sufficient isolation between the sensory and actuator circuits b) a safe sensory circuit. Now, while doing that is probably relatively trivial to actually design, you do need to verify it.<p>So, once again, I agree that there&#x27;s probably too much regulation piled on, but there is a good reason to regulate/verify in some form or way at least the myoelectric device.<p>More generally, notice that the examples that you and sister component pointed out are relatively simple, especially compared to a prosthetic hand.

Currently, you have two options:<p>a) Buy everything separately - tank, filter, heater, plants, fish. You have to find out whether your fish and plants are compatible and your tank is big enough for what you want etc. You have to figure out where to put the heater and filter so that it doesn&#x27;t look unsightly.<p>b) Buy a prebuilt tank with the filter and heater etc. pre-installed somewhere not too ugly. You still have to figure out which livestock you can keep, based on tank size, filter type, plants, and whether they can live with the other livestock you want. You also have to live with the prebuilt tank company&#x27;s design decisions, which you might not like.<p>The solution: a company that offers minimalistic, sleek tanks with a modular system for adding filters, heaters, skimmers, lighting, etc. that keeps the equipment out of the way and not looking ugly. Also, an online service where they can select and order the modular tank and equipment that they want, and be allowed to choose from compatible livestock and plants. Alternatively, they can start with livestock that they want and they can be recommended the right modular tank and equipment etc. They can pay for everything all together and the items would be delivered as they are needed (with marine tanks, for example, you have to let the tank &#x27;cycle&#x27; for a few weeks so that the water parameters normalise before you can add livestock).<p>What do you guys think?",1398007565

The Ukrainian famine is neither unique nor that bad by world standards. The reason why it was shocking to the West is that it happened decades after most other major powers developed trade systems robust enough to deal with similar catastrophes in their own empires. Russia like always was lagging a decades behind the rest of the West. Much the same way the cultural revolution and great leap forward are shocking, they happened at the same time that men were circling the moon, but in a country which had much more in common with the England of the 1830&#x27;s or the Russia of the 1910&#x27;s than any other power then.",1398006763

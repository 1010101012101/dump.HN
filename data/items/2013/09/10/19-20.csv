College rankings hurt low and middle-income students. &quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to argue why offering aid on the basis of merit as opposed to need is a bad thing.<p>&quot;2. The rankings ignore job prospects.&quot;<p>True, but mostly irrelevant. The rankings are broadly correlated with job prospects.<p>&quot;3. The rankings don&#x27;t care about learning outcomes.&quot;<p>College isn&#x27;t about learning, and it&#x27;s not clear there is much difference between colleges in this regard anyway. You don&#x27;t go to Harvard because you think it&#x27;ll teach you better than Penn State. You do it to associate with the other people who got into Harvard.<p>&quot;4. U.S. News runs a beauty pageant.&quot;<p>The side-effect of the beauty pageant is that it tends to echo preconceived notions hiring managers already have.

In part, this is because the majority of these folks do not reside near silicon valley. Average wages in metro areas, excluding &quot;slums&quot;, are significantly higher tha the US average. Stratify Manhatten south of 96th street, for example, vs Metro New york. The support for H1Bs is higher amongst the &quot;manager&quot; class than the working class. The working class gets no benefit from H1Bs. To the working class 64k may be an enourmous salary, but it is not to the manager class. So again, the idea that &quot;workers&quot; have any interest in supporting this is silly. Alternatively, if they had any interest in this area, they would be already working in it, an thus not consider 64k &quot;real money&quot;, because their housing costs are likely 10x that, given the areas in which they need to reside.  Lastly, the h1bs don&#x27;t apply to the type of low-skill labour that concerns the immigration/green card dynamics that the urban minorities/poor do suppor. H1Bs are supported primarily by wealth white suburbia and the &quot;landed gentry&quot; of upper management in urban areas.",1378842858

So why would anyone expect them to take a margin hit pitching a more attractive $450 model (and at the expense of having any clear $550 offering) when they haven&#x27;t soaked the early adopters yet?<p>Next year, the 5C will flow down naturally to the &#x27;good&#x27; slot: 6/5S/5C.

The first is whether our public education system is preparing youth to seize future opportunities. On the whole, I think the answer is at best mixed--but it seems solvable. We can improve our schools and make the students next year smarter than the year before. At least we have the concept of free public education as a platform.<p>The second is what happens to adults who lost their industries? Can a 40-something factory worker or lumberjack learn how to create Android apps that generate revenue? The answer here seems a lot worse.

The words &quot;make me a sandwich&quot; aren&#x27;t powerful because someone of the majority (in, say, a school context) said it, but because of the wider implication that that&#x27;s a woman&#x27;s place--making a sandwich for a man. In fact, these sorts of words can be used by people who have little power in a given context because they derive their power from the wider cultural norms. The power dynamics of whatever isolated group under consideration is what is irrelevant. The fact that they chose to bully her <i>in that specific way</i> indicates a sexist train of thought and that must be addressed separately from the issue of bullying. One can bully based on gender without it being sexist. This was not such a case and that fact is meaningful.",1378841910

6362766,comment,6357317,6362332,5,0,lambda,,,"OK. Let&#x27;s start from the beginning. The post you are replying to was a reply to the general tenor of a lot of posts, like yours, in this kind of thread. Posts which try to deny that there&#x27;s a real problem, that the only reason that there aren&#x27;t as many women in tech is that they have chosen not to.<p>Anecdotes like the original article, as well as many others that have come before, demonstrate that there is a real problem. There is some seriously problematic behavior out there. Now, how much of the gender disparity in tech is due to these kinds of problems, and how much is due to simple self-selection? That&#x27;s hard to say; there may be arguments either way. But that doesn&#x27;t really matter; even if the entire gender disparity can&#x27;t be explained by odious behavior, at least some of it can, because there are very clearly women who are being off-put by very obnoxious, sexist behavior.<p>And furthermore, people are offput by defensive behavior, where tons of people come out of the woodwork and deny that there is any problem whatsoever. If you mention that some behavior makes you uncomfortable, and then a lot of people come out saying &quot;there&#x27;s no problem. It shouldn&#x27;t make you uncomfortable. You just aren&#x27;t all that into tech, you don&#x27;t have thick enough skin&quot; is that going to make you feel welcome and safe?<p>He&#x27;s saying that we need to stop being defensive about it, stop trying to deny that problem, and start taking responsibility for hostile and off-putting behavior. Taking responsibility can include not doing it ourselves, and can also include not treating it as if it&#x27;s acceptable behavior, not turning a blind eye to it, and not denying that that it actually exists.<p>So by telling him that he was discussing imaginary problems, you were doing exactly that. You were ignoring the actual, real, live example of the problem in the original post, and saying that what he was talking about is imaginary. That&#x27;s why I brought up the original post; in order to claim that RyanMcGreal&#x27;s problems were imaginary, you must be claiming that the original post is imaginary.<p>Now, in other posts, you seem to be trying to make the distinction between bullying and sexism, brushing this off as mere bullying. What you&#x27;ve missed is that it can be both. There is racist bullying. There is homophobic bullying. There is sexist bullying. There is bullying just for the sake of bullying. Just because it&#x27;s also bullying, doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not sexist, and part of the pattern of behavior that drives some women from the field.<p>Taking responsibility does not mean saying &quot;oh, I&#x27;m an oppressor, thus I should be ashamed of myself.&quot; It means speaking up when you hear someone being harassed, it means stopping bullying that&#x27;s going on right in your classroom (and being aware enough of your classroom to notice it going on), it means trying to understand why someone&#x27;s upset or offended and try to think of reasonable, fair ways to fix that, rather than immediately jumping to the conclusion that the problem they are describing is not actually a problem.<p>> There is a strong correlation between increased freedom to choose &quot;non-traditional&quot; professions and fewer people choosing them. More women worked &quot;men&#x27;s jobs&quot; when they were told they were men&#x27;s jobs than they do now that they are encouraged to seek those jobs.<p>So, where is your evidence to back up this claim? It&#x27;s a pretty strong claim, so you had better have some pretty good evidence to back it up.",1378841726

6362714,comment,6361323,6361323,3,0,jacobquick,,,"Your CEO is like 10 years too late on this one, companies who offshored or outsourced mostly brought those projects back internal since. The companies that were successful got there by starting a development office in the country they wanted to ship work to, that&#x27;s the only way to do quality control long-term. I&#x27;ve seen companies with less than $3M in revenue do it and then rent the team out to other people for projects. The contract outsourcing teams that were good realized how few of them there were, and then like any good American tech worker those teams raised their price. So the &quot;myriad benefits&quot; are: cost cutting by scraping the bottom of the barrel and accepting that in 3 years you&#x27;ll have to pay an expensive grown up to redo it...and that&#x27;s it.<p>If your CEO is bound and determined to warp you back to 2005, it helps to understand what you are renting when you contract tasks out. If you get a team of 10 people there&#x27;s: one great coder, one pretty great coder, and 8 random shlubs they grabbed off the street. This absolutely includes contract development teams in the United States. The two good coders are the only ones you will be able to communicate with before you sign a contract. The money you pay them (cost: 1 good coder x10) goes straight to paying the two good guys and then the contracting company makes their margins off underpaying the 8 shlubs. Note none of these are management, project management, or anything else. At best one of the two guys is a Lead Developer but that isn&#x27;t management.<p>So in order to do it effectively, you have to have an extra manager in your location whose entire job is to manage the offshore/outsourced team directly. Not a project manager, a literal manager of software engineers. He absolutely has to be able to do weekly code reviews because the two good guys aren&#x27;t going to do it for the 8 other guys who need it. He has to watch that each of the 8 guys are doing work, checking in their own code (some of them will have their sister do it because that&#x27;s how they got through college), and you have to have language in the contract where this in-house manager can jettison anyone who can&#x27;t keep up. The price of that guy needs to be factored into the &#x27;cost&#x27; side of the cost/benefit, along with the regular project manager and tech executive time at your end. These people will work twice as hard communicating everything twice to the remote team.<p>At this point you should be thinking &quot;why don&#x27;t I just hire this theoretical Managing Developer and then give him two mid-senior recs in-house and let them do the project themselves?&quot;<p>You can try to offload trivial coding tasks to them but palidanx is right, do not dump infrastructure, foundational tech, or release engineering on them. They will screw it up and in the process they will screw up all your in-house people&#x27;s work, too.",1378841412

I regret that I am not at liberty to disclose most specific results, but gradual engagement is <i>really</i> tricky to pull off well, and has often roundly failed compared to the traditional get-their-email-first signup screen.  This is true even at companies which don&#x27;t do anything very sophisticated with the email address once they have it, which is (IMHO) generally a mistake in the sort of markets I usually work in.<p>The one product I can talk about: Back in the day, Bingo Card Creator had one-click guest accounts.

(From the perspective of most of my users gradual engagement means &quot;The Googles ate my work and now you have ruined the day of a room full of third graders, you monster.&quot;)  The engineering to support them was fiddly, and ripping it out made the application better.  (Despite several attempts to improve them I don&#x27;t think I ever had near the UX work invested to make the experience not be awful.  Again, gradual engagement UX is <i>quite challenging</i>.  In particular, the handoff between guest accounts and &quot;real&quot; trial accounts is of paramount importance to my business but is meaningless to customers who have guest accounts <i>until they get to school</i>, at which point they will often discover, to their surprise, that failing to make the decision yesterday to give me their email address now means their cards are totally inaccessible.  I never successfully figured out a way -- copy, design, workflow, etc -- to avoid having huge numbers of people fail at this use case.)<p>Discontinuing guest accounts increased signups of &quot;real&quot; accounts and also sales, if I remember correctly.

But the point is that <i>you can make it</i>. You can take their contract, alter it, sign the altered copy, and send it back, and then they can accept or refuse. The important point here is that <i>you are not considered to have agreed to the original because you signed an altered copy</i>.<p>A more thorough way to do this electronically would be to modify the DOM, save the modified agreement, click Agree to sign your end, and then e-mail the modified agreement back to the originator and let them know what&#x27;s going on. Of course, their automated systems have given you access in the meantime, but that&#x27;s hardly <i>your</i> fault.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand how making a modification you know won&#x27;t be sent back to the server is &quot;fraud&quot;, but sending the user an agreement you know won&#x27;t be read is &quot;not fraud&quot;. Seems like either we base both scenarios on what people <i>should</i> do (read the original/modified agreement), or on what people <i>actually</i> do (not read anything), but not base one scenario on one and one scenario on the other.<p>You say you don&#x27;t see why an agreement to the original is invalidated because you couldn&#x27;t make a counter-offer, but that&#x27;s how contracts work. Negotiation is inherent to the process. Big companies are trying to hide that with form contracts that everyone is expected to sign as-is, but it&#x27;s still supposed to be present.",1378840995

Similarly with countries. These metrics refer to real data corresponding to the actual, real-life experience of people living in these places. If the number of emergency rooms per capita in a country is low, for example, that corresponds to actually higher likelihood that you&#x27;ll be unable to get to one if you live in that country and are in an emergency situation. The data is real - the author might not like that it seems like a simplistic representation and glosses over a lot of nuances, but then why else do we measure and quantify these trends than to tease out meaningful information from an otherwise incomprehensible, highly complex system?<p>Even though a single year snapshot of college rankings  isn&#x27;t completely meaningful by itself, you can glean a lot from the movements in the rankings, even with small movements. If a college goes from 200 to 190 in a single year, you can probably determine precisely what changed how by looking at the changes in the internals that they used to derive the number. And sometimes even a small change in ranking does reflect a significant, concrete change in the experience of students attending these institutions.<p>Similarly, with countries.

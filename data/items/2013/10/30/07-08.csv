6639997,comment,6633400,6639927,1,0,Weltan,,,"Yeah, asking why you do something is as much a question about an action as asking whether you&#x27;d do it. You&#x27;re not asking &quot;Would you pay it?&quot; you&#x27;re asking: &quot;Would you pay it if condition x were false?&quot; You&#x27;re taking it out of reality, where condition x is true. I agree, you could ask: &quot;Would you pay it?&quot; but the response from the person to that question would be useless without the necessary conditional you&#x27;ve put in it. However, as soon as you put in the conditional about a state of affairs, the person is not analysing their action as it is, but is instead analsying their action according to a state of affairs that may exist. It&#x27;s as much a mental trick as it is in a case where people convince themselves it&#x27;s a good idea if it&#x27;s inevitable.<p>That goes back to what I said before, which you ignored, if you were to ask me: &quot;Would you still work if you were a millionaire?&quot; I might say: &quot;No.&quot; That&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s not true for any useful purpose, because I&#x27;m not a millionaire. If you ask me: &quot;Why do you work?&quot; I might say: &quot;Because I like making money.&quot; In fact, the latter case is a more truthful statement than the previous case, because I don&#x27;t actually know what Millionaire-Me might do whereas I do know what Non-millionaire Me would do (work). In any event, the previous question doesn&#x27;t tell you whether or not I consider the fact I work voluntary, in fact, it doesn&#x27;t tell you very much anything at all. I personally do consider the fact I work voluntary, but you&#x27;d have to ask the latter question to find that fact out. If you just had the previous question and left it, you might as well assume I believe that I work involuntarily.<p>In the end, you ARE asking for an opinion, the way you propose is a less honest way to do so considering what the inquiry at hand is. Remember, I said that people might have multiple reasons why they pay taxes. This is a sociological fact. Even one person might have multiple reasons why they pay taxes.<p>If you asked me your question:<p>&quot;Would you pay taxes if you weren&#x27;t forced to?&quot; I&#x27;d say: &quot;Yes.&quot; That&#x27;s all you get.<p>My question:<p>&quot;Why do you pay taxes?&quot; &quot;Fear of jail if I don&#x27;t, because they pay for roads, social services, because I believe they are a legitimate exercise of function of government.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not lying, no reason to, I pay taxes for multiple reasons and so do most people, and these preferences themselves may be ordered, maybe on my scale of preferences the fear of jail is in-fact less than the fear of potentially unmaintained roads if I have a nice car, for example.<p>Actually, an idea: Presumably we can synthesise the inquiry, ask &quot;Why&quot; and then ask &quot;Would you still do it&quot;, or do it in reverse order. Then, ask people what their preference scales are, etc, etc. You&#x27;ll find out more information about the reasons people pay taxes, you&#x27;ll also find that what I said before is true: people pay taxes for multiple reasons.",1383117649

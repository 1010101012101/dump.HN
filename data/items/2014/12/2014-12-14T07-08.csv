It sucks but it happens everywhere. It is really really hard not to be evil as a big company, hence it&#x27;s probably better to just stay small if you have that goal. In some companies you have a social net to catch you; I believe companies, when hiring/acquihiring, should be held responsible for those people. But I understand this is not (always) possible. The staff being the most important asset of a company (as they like to say) usually only goes for the super-human part of the staff, not for the rest.",1418543921

8747690,comment,8747057,8747373,0,0,manover,,,"In other words, OpenCL supports this very limited buffer interface due to compatibility issues, i.e. this kind of MMIO is the lowest common denominator that has to be implemented by any GPU claiming OpenCL compatibility. Although, this does not preclude most desktop discrete GPUs from mapping their whole internal VRAM onto host&#x27;s memory address space through PCI bus. It seems to be the common mechanism for a host to access VRAM in the modern ATI and NVidia GPUs from what I understood after skimming through several technical documents. It is, by the way, as far as I can tell, the main reason behind the infamous &#x27;memory hole&#x27; in 32-bit Windows OS&#x27;s (inability to use more than 2.5-3G of RAM).
So, I guess, the correct answer to my initial question as to why it&#x27;s not possible to use tmpfs with VRAM would be because that will require special memory allocation made in VRAM. Meaning, a patch to tmpfs code that can properly allocate memory in VRAM buffer would suffice if we are willing to limit compatibility to 64-bit x86 architecture with AMD/NVidia GPUs.",1418542963

    ; now define a curried foldr:
    (define cfoldr (curry3 foldr))

    ; and finally:
    (define sum ((cfoldr +) 0))

I mean, I&#x27;m all for holding those responsible to account, but, firstly, nothing will change unless the US itself holds those people to account. Second the UN are firmly on the side of human rights violators that make Hitler look like a beginner, and the UN itself also feels the need to commit massacres and mass-rapes on a regular basis. No one has even been held to account, not even in Northern Europe.<p>I mean, I understand the concept of realpolitik, but this is driving things very, very far.<p>Furthermore, there is no such thing as international jurisdiction, despite what the UN would want you to believe. It is about as legal as the US&#x27; execution of Bin Laden. If countries were to start persecuting each other&#x27;s armies it would quickly end very badly, obviously. Hell, the half of the Saudi royal family would probably be sentenced to death in the US in the first month (because half of them have tortured and killed servants [8] [9] [10]). Do you think it&#x27;d be smart to do that ?. Also note that this is normal practice in Saudi Arabia [11].<p>Personally I find the UN&#x27;s distasteful double standard an atrocious joke. Since 1994, the majority of UN member countries have constitutions in direct contradiction with human rights, the biggest one being China (well, in terms of power and population), and the biggest block being islamic nations, that disallow freedom of religion and equality of sexes (and usually equality of ethnicities as well, ie. direct legal racism, like it exists in the majority of islamic nations, as well as in China and other nations).<p>And that&#x27;s ignoring the many, many, many human rights violations perpetrated by the UN itself [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]<p>As you can see on the Human Rights Council&#x27; wikipedia pages [6], the biggest human rights issues are :<p>1) Israel. Since 2006, EVERY meeting of the human rights council has over half of the time dedicated to Israel&#x27;s human rights abuses. The person currently in charge of setting the agenda for this part of the meeting felt the need to publish this picture : <a href=""http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/AS-Cartoon.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/AS-Cartoo...</a> (note the kippah on the dog)<p>&quot;There has never been a single resolution about the decades-long repression of the civil and political rights of 1.3 billion people in China, or the more than a million female migrant workers in Saudi Arabia being kept as virtual slaves, or the virulent racism which has brought 600,000 people to the brink of starvation in Zimbabwe. Every year, UN bodies are required to produce at least 25 reports on alleged human rights violations by Israel, but not one on an Iranian criminal justice system which mandates punishments like crucifixion, stoning, and cross-amputation. This is not legitimate critique of states with equal or worse human rights records. It is demonization of the Jewish state.&quot; [7]<p>2) Defamation of religion (dozens of resolution calling for world-wide introduction of blasphemy laws)<p>And internal politics concerning who gets a seat (and over a million bucks per year, free travel, a staff, ...)<p>These are the guys you&#x27;re asking for help.

They learned to program or create art to make games, not vice versa. Many programmers began coding because they wanted to make games, including myself. But I think most people don&#x27;t find game code interesting after they make some initial demos, outside of a few areas like computer graphics, which is pretty centralized nowadays in engine vendors like Unity and Unreal.<p>But there are those who believe in games, who live them day and night, who idolize famous developers like rock stars. They would like nothing more than to work at $GAMEDEV.<p>As a result, they might not be comparison shopping with other company types like other programmers between financial, startup, BigCo, and others.<p>I myself considered entering games for a long time, but growing fear of entering such a predatory industry, as well as a growing interest in PLT and other CS topics, led me away from that path. I still would consider joining or starting a small indie team, and participating in game jams or game hackathons. But I personally don&#x27;t see the appeal of AAA jobs - the artistry isn&#x27;t there the way it is with indie games, and the pay isn&#x27;t either.<p>One note - the movement to F2P games like Dota2 and LoL seems to be improving this trend.

The games industry feeds on exploiting the idealism of youth. Young guys who grow up with &#x27;making games&#x27; as their dream job, but no idea how the sausage is made, are hired up for QA jobs and junior programming jobs with promises to do just that. And when they burn out or realize they&#x27;re just going to be doing bug testing for the rest of their lives because they don&#x27;t actually have the experience to be anything else, the industry shrugs and hires one of the thousands of others lining up at the door with the same dreams.<p>The whole reason the indie market in games has exploded is precisely because of this, I think. The ones who burn out but still have the talent, or who&#x27;re smart enough to avoid the AAA system to begin with, just say fuck it and make their own games like almost everyone once did in the 80s. Market standards have shifted from necessarily expecting only the AAA experience, and while few indie games are going to rival the sales of the next hoorah-FPS game, if you&#x27;re lucky, talented, and willing to spend a fuckload of time self-promoting, you can eke out a living without the meatgrinder.",1418541859

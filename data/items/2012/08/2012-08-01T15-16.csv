They also probably want that person to eventually be placed full-time (if that's what the position is for) because that typically means more $ for them.  If that person leaves the company in 1 year (bad for the company), the recruiter probably doesn't really care as they can rep them again and the $ cycle continues.<p>I'm not knocking recruiters, I've been employed full time via them since 2008 (on my 2nd gig now).  It does get me, though, that my current recruiter has been getting paid since January and literally all they did was set up an interview.  She told me she didn't even check references, that ""my resume was enough"".  Granted, I've been in the game for quite a while, but literally, she's still getting paid for setting up an interview.<p>They do everything, and nothing.",1343836798

The ""results"" include the ""output"" but are not limited to it: they also include things like state changes, possible exceptions, and I/O. That's why Haskell is so big on Monads, because that's the best way to embed these results into a return value.<p>In a systems language like C or Rust, a type represents the size and meaning of an area of memory: is it an int, a float, a pointer to a float that stays constant, or a pointer to a float that someone else can change?<p>In languages like C# & Java, a type represents something like the allowable operations on a value, usually represented as the list of methods on a class.<p>What this article is basically doing is taking a type system of the third category (C#, allowable operations), and embedding into it a type system of the first category (result of computation).

Concurrency & parallelism have often been given as rationales, but I suspect the real reason is the need for programs (and libraries) to behave as intended and the desire to express complicated processes more simply. And the driver for that may be that a 'commodity programmer' mindset for businesses is faltering as the rate of change and complexity of technology increases.<p>In my hiring experience, readily available programmers are well-versed in the technology of several years ago. This makes sense because they've spent their time maintaining and extending systems designed and built years ago. But as requirements increase and become more exotic (due to competitive business pressure), such systems get used beyond their original design, and become more difficult to work with. I believe a 'testing culture' developed to mitigate this risk (along with the rise of dynamic language use to address the need for development speed). The hope was that the cost of testing (which can be pretty heavy for a business) would outweigh the cost of maintenance. But the overhead incurred may go to trivialities (ie, test that are easy to write) or struggling to implement more complex (and probably more valuable) tests which themselves are prone to trouble.  Wouldn't it be nice if the parts of the program did what was intended and that testing be used more selectively to ensure the integrity of the system? I think correctness is one of the things functional programming languages encourage.<p>Types are an important part of many (most?) functional languages and are arguably an important part of the puzzle of building correct program components. I think we'll see a lot more articles musing on what they mean for engineering.",1343835215

4323433,comment,4321001,4322363,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That is a great question. And I think the wrong one. But let me share my reasoning and you can tell me if you agree with that or not.<p>My reasoning goes like this, if you believe the smartphone and tablet is how people will be consuming the types of services Google would like to offer (Search, Social, Etc) then Google needs to be able to deliver and innovate in that market. If the market leader in devices is hostile to Google, then Google needs to either enable a new leader that they can control or be the new leader. Android's strategy of being open has been excellent at acquiring hardware partners but it has not been able to compete in terms of user experience. Apple has demonstrated for three generations (3G, 4, 4S) that user experience dominates the smartphone decision. And the user experience is dominated by graphics and graphics performance.<p>I don't think three years ago Google could have appreciated just how much the impact that solid graphics support would have in consumer's minds, but now it seems painfully clear to me (and other bloggers who do these types of articles and Anandtech Etc etc) that this part of the equation is key.<p>I claim that if Google's Android can nearly match Apple software feature for feature in Smartphone OSes, but they don't have a hardware partner that can deliver graphics performance. So by the same reasoning that said ""we need to create an OS for smartphones that we're able to compete with"" they should now know that ""we need to create the complete platform that enables a competitive user experience."" The biggest and most stubborn nail sticking up from that problem is effective, high performance, graphics drivers. What is perhaps more important, the emergence of the tablet as a viable platform makes that problem stick out more.<p>So Google spends 1.8 Billion dollars over 5 years, and as a result goes from having Android devices being 1/10th to 1/8th the market for tablets to being 1/2 or 2/3rds? If they achieve that objective then yes, the rate of the return for that investment will swamp any other use of that money.<p>The 'do nothing' strategy of having that 1.8B$ sit in cash and cash equivalents for the next 5 years looks to return less than 250 M$ (with at most a 5% annualized rate of return in the kinds of securities they would hold it in)<p>Makes it look like a simple call from the outside, I completely recognize that it is painfully hard for at least one member of the OC [1] to spend like that, and they've had way too much say on how money was spent for the last 5 years.<p>But the reason I think it is the wrong question, is that once you start thinking about it in rates of return your value system is dollars for dollars. I think the right question would be to ask ""Is there anything holding back the growth of Android that <i>only</i> Google with its resources (cash, brainpower, etc) can fix?"" And I think the answer to that is yes, this one.<p>[1] The ""OC"" or ""Organizing Committee"" is Google's equivalent of the 'executive staff' or the 'executive management group'",1343835123

Programs that start at age 13-14 have those early years to fight with in order to create an interest in software and instill self-confidence.  It reminds me of an old article on gender imbalances from 1970, where it argues that while we say people have free will when they choose their careers, they combat 20 years of social molding that's difficult to break. [1]<p>It'd be interesting to see the differences in upbringing that allowed for the Soviet Union back in the 60s to have a stat where ""one-third of the engineers and 75 percent of the physicians are women."" [1]<p>Having been in the role of a guy in a computer science class at a large public university with roughly similar ratios, I wouldn't say that the motivation that people don't work with women is mostly due to the stereotype.  It's likely due to the social ineptitude of engineering students.  I definitely could relate to Max Levchin talk about how PayPal had difficulty in hiring women because they were nerds that didn't know how to relate to women. [2]  Granted, as the author points out, the stereotype threat exists due to the outcome being perceived as social bias.<p>Perhaps a solution as well is to help nerdy guys interact with girls in high school while the gender balance is fairly balanced.  Perhaps projects with ""random"" (assigned) partners.  Looking back at some of the things I did, I can't believe I was that socially awkward.<p>[1] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=dwTvE44DOgQC&lpg=PA145&ots=sQrKj_1REh&&pg=PA183#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=dwTvE44DOgQC&lpg=PA145&...</a> pg 188<p>[2] <a href=""http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/21437840885/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-5-notes-essay"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/21437840885/peter-thiels...</a>",1343835029

4323303,comment,4322767,4323163,9,0,prawks,,,"I believe the reason people feel it's difficult is that a blank prompt is inherently not intuitive. There's no way you can hand someone a command line interface with an empty prompt and let them fiddle with it. They need to know <i>what</i> to type to start doing what they want to do beforehand, there's no way you can really ""experiment"" when you don't know where to start.<p>It's very similar to many mainframe interfaces with non-intuitive commands. Many legacy IT departments have these. Questions like ""How do I do X?"" have answers from experts like ""Type XKY= and then hit PF3"". But that sequence of steps is nowhere on the current screen's list of commands, or in it's help documentation. You just need to know it.<p>This is in contrast to a GUI where every single thing you can do (aside from keyboard shortcuts) is visible. I can hit a random button and see what happens. In a CLI, there are too many possible alphanumeric strings to try, so I can't do the same thing.<p>(This is of course different if the prompt is not blank, and   says ""Type 'help' for help"")",1343833873

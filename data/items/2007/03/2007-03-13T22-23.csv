Actually, the cheapest macbook pro costs the same as the high-end Toshiba. If you make good money, it's not a big deal. But when the girl in the coffeehouse asks me what kind of computer she should get to go along with her minimum wage, I'm basically scum to recommend an Apple.",1173826613

I'm in the market for a new laptop, and I'm hard pressed against picking one up because they aren't that much more expensive than the laptops that I am looking at.",1173826140
4013,comment,4006,4012,0,0,JMiao,,,"I definitely hear what you're saying (my background is in interactive games)...aside from MMOs, this is another compelling reason why a unified online framework like XBOX Live works so well.<p>Things like Gamervision are more focused on networks for gamer interests (""life outside of the game""), i.e. discussing things that matter to gamers.  There's another one specific to WOW called Rupture that is VC-backed and founded by Shawn Fanning of Napster fame.<p>Again, I'm not defending things like Gamervision.  I'm more keen about Raph Koster's work.",1173826105

4011,comment,4007,4007,0,0,JMiao,,,"I would imagine such a situation to be dicey.  Startups are forged around shared passion, trust, and ability to work well together, not too different from marriage.  Using the marriage metaphor, I think going into business together on a first impression puts you and your cofounders in a tight spot.",1173825512

4009,comment,3804,3804,0,0,cbueno,,,"I saw Boord last week at a startup panel at Florida Intl Uni. It reminded me of Garcia-Marquez's book ""In Evil Hour/La mala hora"", in which a town is plagued by anonymous character assasination.<p>There are two problems that everyone latches onto when they hear about it: posts are anonymous, and you can't opt in or out. The model is coercive. If someone wants to attack you you are given no choice but to register and marshall your friends.<p>On the other hand, I discount objections that everyone immediately latches onto. Often that means the idea is simply strange or taboo, not unworkable. Remember that the first proposed application of anonymous digital cash was an assasination pool.",1173824868
4008,comment,4006,4006,0,0,JMiao,,,"I'm curious how this stands a chance in light of XBOX Live and popular gaming sites like Gamespot.  Facebook has an ongoing petition for a ""Favorite Games"" profile category, but I know that Gamespot has had a tough time getting people to interact outside of commenting on news articles and previews.<p>Sort of bothered by the site's cluttered design -- the blog posts on the left hand side are colored to look like cheesy, forgettable advertising.",1173824742

Probably why he was glad to sell it and get rid of the company.<p>- Create your own open source project, as soon as it is used by other they will want additional feature and fixes.<p>- Working with others to create something means that there will be trade-offs on what everyone does.<p>""If you have to ask permission or answer to anyone then you don't have the kind of freedom I want.""<p>Not sure what kind of freedom you want, but unless you are living on an island by yourself creating software that no one uses it seems your lying to yourself if you think you have achieved.",1244681559

However, I think he and others have missed out on the significance of the 'URL on facebook' as opposed to the 'real domain that you can own'.<p>The reason that people are excited it about it is because it's <i>starting from scratch</i>. That is, I may actually have the chance to get a username like 'scott' or 'sdt' rather than scott-siliconvalley94043. Since facebook is already a fairly canonical place to go for personal contact info, interests, etc, this is fairly huge.<p>The other important bit is that because facebook is a fairly canonical reference point, and it has very good search rankings, having your name established is going to be important. If some random 6th cousin of mine got the facebook.com/my.full.name and started ranking higher than my personal site for googling ""my full name"", I'd be pretty pissed.

652078,comment,651695,651695,0,0,sounddust,,,"Owning a domain name sounds like the best choice for one's online identity, but realistically it's not the best choice for about 198 million out of the 200 million people who use Facebook.<p>First of all, for many people, the only online presence they have is their Facebook account.  Why would they buy a domain name?  So that they can point it to their Facebook profile?<p>Secondly, owning a domain costs money and requires work to maintain (a lot of work if you are not tech-savvy).  I'd guess a very small percentage of Facebook users would be willing to pay $10/year to use the site.  So why would someone expect them to pay $10/year for a domain name?<p>Finally, what's to say that a facebook vanity URL is not a better choice than a domain name?  Musicians often advertise using their myspace URL because it's easy to remember than a domain - you only have to remember a single word.   It's entirely possible, depending on the success of Facebook, for people to be asking each other in 5 years, ""what's your facebook address?""  as it's easier than the current method of searching Facebook by name and sifting through 100 people with that name",1244680305

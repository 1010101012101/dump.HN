The baby boomers are retiring now, so lets use them as an easy 'oldest' generation.<p>The US currently has 300 million people. So according to this guy, just before the boomers, there were only 3 million people.<p>Truly, it is a testament to the industriousness of the American public how with only 3 million people, they managed to send 16 million to serve in the military in WWII, and still have enough people left over to manufacture military hardware to supply the Allies.<p>The guy has a point about home environment being important, and that endemic poverty for blacks in the US is a problem, but you can't just carve those out of the results. For a start, those blacks are <i>still</i> American, born and bred for generations. Secondly, every country has sections of entrenched poor. In the US it's much easier to divide along race lines.

I'm not advancing the exact opposite of what Joel suggests. I'm suggesting something very moderate.<p>So yeah, checking in every week or two works. That's fine. Religiously following news is just as bad as not following any news. So we can agree on that part - the checking in part. I'm not sure how often is necessary but picking up a newspaper or watching a news cast here or there is enough.<p>When you say ""Heck, why think?"" you seem to say it with disdain as if it were a bad thing. It certainly can be and these days it's doing more harm than good but part of what was great about the news is that it took the burden of thinking away from people. So then when you hear news, instead of trying to make sense of it yourself all you have to do is ask two questions:<p>1. ""Do I trust the way this reporter has put together this story and why?""<p>2. ""Do I agree with the viewpoint presented"" (applies for opinions mostly)<p>News was biased from the start and news anchors did the a lot of the legwork of thinking for the viewer and it was okay because they could be trusted. It was only once ""the powers that be"" caught on to the fact that Americans trusted what they heard and once they mostly stopped evaluating it that they took advantage.<p>There was a time when Edward R. Murrow presented the facts to the American Public and very plainly presented his own <i>opinions</i> to the viewers and it was valuable and trustworthy. He used his position to help take down McCarthy when the House Unamerican Activities investigations were going on. In that situation it was well worth staying informed. People felt it was their civic duty to do so. It was also a situation where me opinion had merit and the other was clearly wrong. The news used to have nuance and it wasn't childish like today's choice of either ""everything has to seem equal"" or ""all our biased opinions are right"" type news networks/shows.<p>But I digress and romanticize the news. You're right. You're basically saying news in moderation is good. I couldn't agree more. Being a news junkie and ignoring the news is detrimental while moderate news intake is helpful. That's all I'm saying.",1347756649

4527809,comment,4526243,4526758,1,0,esonderegger,,,"The DRM argument for piracy is a bit of a straw man.<p>Music hasn't been sold with DRM for over three years, but it still makes up a sizable portion of The Pirate Bay's offerings. You could say that musicians are being tyrannical by choosing to distribute their recordings in the way that maximizes their profit instead of choosing to give it away. I would reply that some people do choose to give away their work. I'm happy to live in a world where people get to make that choice of what to do with something they've created.<p>Obviously movies, tv shows, and books are another matter. Personally, I think it's only a matter of time until those go DRM-free too, but a ""matter of time"" might longer than any of us would wish for. This is more of a matter of business model. There never really was a rental model for music in the physical media era, however, consumers seem to have a demand for a digital version of renting movies. With books, I think the parallel is libraries where you could sign out a book and return it. In any event, consumers seem to prefer paying a lower price for the ability to consume a movie/tv show/book for a limited time window to paying a higher price for the ability to keep it.<p>It should go without saying in this community that a rental model for media without DRM simply wouldn't work. Because there would be no means to return the movie/tv/show/book other than making the user promise to delete the file, a DRM-free ""rental"" would become equivalent to a sale. The result would be less consumer choice.<p>As for when the ""sale"" option goes DRM-free, I think someone will come along and offer movies in three tiers:<p>1. rental (with DRM, obviously), for about $4\n2. sale, with DRM limiting how many times it can be copied, for about $8\n3. sale, DRM-free, for maybe $12<p>It will be interesting to see how many people opt for #3. Getting a critical mass of people to choose to spend a little more for a DRM-free product is how we'll get to a future without DRM. The number of people using sites like The Pirate Bay won't even be a major factor in those discussions.",1347755817

I'm going to assume that a designer wouldn't use your service, nor probably higher-end presenters; too much is riding on their presentations to leave them to an outside service. Your target is more likely business folks who give presentations sometimes, its not a primary aspect of their job, and sometimes these presentations mean a lot and they want design help.<p>But what does design help mean? Layouts, fonts, and colors? Assets, structure, and story telling? If the former, the client could easily game you by having a few slides done and repeating the style; these aren't posters after all! The latter is much less gameable, but also much more involved, I don't see how that could work at all without a tight feedback loop between the designer and client.<p>I dislike ""name your own price"" models personally. You might get the occasional sociopath who pays little, and everyone else will agonize over coming up with the right price to pay. Sometimes its easier to just set some kind of price, you might put slides into different buckets based on their complexity/work needed and compute a price dynamically (use per-word, per-graphic, speaking time specified by the user, etc...).

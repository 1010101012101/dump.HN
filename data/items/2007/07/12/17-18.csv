33873,comment,33848,33864,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I thought that Godin's point was that you need to make something <i>one</i> person will want before you can make something <i>lots</i> of people will want.  If you don't have a useful product, it doesn't matter how much advertising or PR or scalability you throw at it, nobody will use it.<p>You need to scale before others push you out of the game, true; but before you need to scale, you need to have something worth scaling.  A complex system that does everything for everybody and can stand up to a million users isn't worth anything until <i>somebody</i> finds it useful.",1184262952

A similar pricing structure in the online world is web hosting for only $7/month<i></i> ""WOW!! That's cheap!!!""  (<i></i> your signup choices are $7/month for 36 months + $120 setup charge, $15/month for 24 months + no setup fee, or $20/month for 12 months + $40 setup fee) It's a strategy of getting the typical customer to spend more per sale.",1184262903

33870,comment,33738,33798,0,0,martin,,,"It could be done this way, but frankly, Abiword's Word importer isn't very good. OpenOffice's, while not perfect, is much better. Unfortunately, unlike Abiword, OOo doesn't come with a nice command-line utility for doing those conversions. OOo has a VBA-esque language that allows you to automate tasks like that, but it's a lot more suitable for more ""interactive"" purposes than as part of another app's backend.<p>Another thing to note is that some of Scribd's backend is written in C#. Maybe if your app is Windows based, there are Office API calls that let you do stuff like this. Just a guess, though.",1184262567

I'd sign up for something but I  wouldn't buy anything through it.",1184261899

Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to purchase on the spot.",1184260648

33864,comment,33848,33848,0,0,startupper,,,"Extrapolating these little nuggets of wisdom to every situation is meaningless.  For instance it simply does not apply to a startup that is looking to build something complex.  And in that case you absolutely need to scale before someone else does and pushes you out of the game.  Small before big does not make sense, unless small is a meaningful and reasonable number.<p><p><p>\n",1184260179

The page content would have to say something like ""you can buy the item we reviewed through this banner, the vendor is reliable"". <p>I think it's still a bit of a stretch...",1184259897

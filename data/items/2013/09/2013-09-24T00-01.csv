They need to offer a compelling reason to purchase a surface over those other brands of tablets. The windows desktop with a decent selection of apps (because of the removed signature lock) would offer that.<p>The thing is I don&#x27;t actually specifically want a pro. All I want is a device that I can create content on. For me, creating content means I want it to run Visual Studio, Photoshop and Blender, along with some toolchain type apps like Git, Dropbox and Filezilla. These apps are just not ever going to appear as Metro apps. So currently, I choose to buy a laptop for half the price of a Surface pro.<p>The problem is the competition they have targeted. They&#x27;ve pitched the RT against the IPad and Androids and it loses on functionality, and they&#x27;ve pitched the pro against Laptops and it loses on price. An unrestricted RT would win against the IPad/Android on functionality and the win against the laptop on size and flexibility while matching it on price.",1379984352

It isn&#x27;t very hard being a &quot;10x&quot; engineer if you look at the average programmer profile :<p>Arrive at 9:30, start out with 30 minutes at the coffee machine. They get mad if you discuss work at this point, or god forbid, talk about interesting algorithms or the like.
They expect to be told exactly what to do, or they won&#x27;t even sit down. If you don&#x27;t give them an exact list of methods to implement in a class, nothing will happen.
You can give them documents about the design, but they won&#x27;t read them, let alone provide feedback. Not even after asking them 5 times.
Similarly, when I started my recent project, I asked one of the customers for the canonical book on the subject and read (most) of it. I do not consider this special behaviour, but I&#x27;m definitely the only one to have done this.
They treat this as normal, and if they make basic problem interpretation mistakes that would make you think a highschooler had mental problems, the reply is &quot;it&#x27;s in the design&quot;. Similarly classifying bugs correctly is impossible. A letter out of place in the UI they treat as equally serious as getting the wrong outcome in a financial calculation. If some programmer put &quot;fucking&quot; in some UI text (the one I talk about below), then we drop everything else, right ?
They work to satisfy the exact wording of the policies, and never ask for (or tolerate in code reviews) exceptions. If you don&#x27;t have 5 exceptions to the style guide and 5 things where they claim &quot;sure, but the obvious unit test would be worthless, so I tested ...&quot;, chances are you don&#x27;t understand the problem, don&#x27;t understand the language well, or there is something wrong.<p>Of course, this is the &quot;average&quot; programmer at a place like a bank. I&#x27;m sure at Google or a few other places, it doesn&#x27;t quite work like this. Being a 10x programmer is easy in a team filled with this kind of staffers.<p>I once had a guy that I&#x27;m totally unsure whether he was a fantastic programmer, or totally worthless. He&#x27;d be sitting behind his desk for the first week of the project. Almost without exception he wouldn&#x27;t have his IDE open, but have an ipython notebook with some part of the problem open. Alarmingly often, he&#x27;d have hacker news, or dzone open and would be reading articles (I mean 50%+ of the time, not once or twice a day). Meanwhile his output in code was exactly zero for that week. Then, suddenly, in a little over a day (when he had claimed he could do it in an afternoon), he&#x27;d checked in the source for an entire module (that would have taken us probably a month to write, at least half a month). It wasn&#x27;t 100% bug-free, but it was good enough to make the product functional. And while he took care of any bugs pointed out to him in minutes flat, for the rest of the week it was back to reading and experimenting (I think) mostly unrelated things. The problem is, this guy is not failure-free. He has these bursts of productivity, and sometimes he writes something beside the point (all programmers do), however it is really hard to ignore the week of wasted time when something he does gets rejected. We have a -sort of- working relationship, but it&#x27;s not exactly smooth sailing. Any relatively independent and hard problem, he gets to do. And if something just needs to start working, we throw it his way. The result of that second part tends to infuriate other developers, but at the demo the UI works, with the project only half finished, which is something customers and managers appreciate. He tends to have his IDE open, modifying code, often while we&#x27;re walking into the demo room, which doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence to me. His reputation with the team is on a constant change. He&#x27;s lazy, self-centered bordering on egoistic, can&#x27;t follow instructions (granted, he generally makes good cases that the problem is with the instructions, not with him. But the frequency of him not following instructions is just so much higher than with the rest of the team it&#x27;s not realistic). He ignores his coworkers, and of course they can&#x27;t deal very well with the fact that there regularly are weeks with his productivity at zero. They don&#x27;t feel to well about his productivity being off the scale for a few days either, by the way. Oh and once, he wrote 10 pages of code that implemented a complex algorithm, when we needed it, and all variable names were girl&#x27;s names. Every single one. As in &quot;for (int debby : kaithlin) {&quot; type code. Why ? Because he had an argument with the architect.<p>So tell me, is this a good engineer ? Great ? Or a disaster ? He&#x27;s not exactly a stabilizing force, that&#x27;s for sure. There regularly are times when I wouldn&#x27;t want to do without him, but most of the time, I&#x27;d like to make a hole in the window with his exact silhouette. More than one of his coworkers have mentioned something along the lines of &quot;can&#x27;t we fire him 4 weeks out of 5 ?&quot;.",1379983583

UTF-8 is important but it is the natural evolution of Unicode.

It takes plenty; I should know. But the problem isn&#x27;t that Amazon is necessarily less expensive, or more expensive, or more reliable, or less reliable. All of that depends on the context. The problem is that the context is rarely reported in this genre of blog post. These posts tend to fixate on the size of the hosting bill.

6435100,comment,6431573,6434193,10,0,jdlshore,,,"So, for anyone following this saga...<p>In researching this issue, I found recommendations that 2.5mbps is probably the most you should plan for in North America. I&#x27;m not sure how accurate or current that recommendation is, but since I was seeing problems at 2.8mbps, it seems reasonable. (It also might explain why I have such a large proportion of international subscribers.) That said, I&#x27;d really love to get my bitrate below 2.0mbps, because that&#x27;s what my actual videos come in at.<p>I went into my video export settings and fiddled (and fiddled, and fiddled) and ended up finding a compromise that gave me 1.94mbps at the cost of slightly-visible artifacting during transitions. [1] Bingo! Uploaded, deployed, done.<p>Well, not <i>entirely</i> done. I&#x27;m still using my old settings for most videos, because it doesn&#x27;t have any visible compression artifacts at all, at least not until you get out the magnifying glass. (I can get away with such high quality because, although my screencasts have more transitions and motion than average, they&#x27;re still mostly unchanging text.) But I don&#x27;t want to run into this problem again. It&#x27;s embarrassing. And I like killing problems dead. DEAD!<p>So I modified my deploy script to run `ffprobe` and pull out the bitrate for each new video. If it exceeds 1750kbps, I get a warning. And if it exceeds 2000kbps, the script fails. [2] That&#x27;ll do it.<p>Of course, the real root cause here is that I don&#x27;t have visibility into client-side performance issues. Eventually, I&#x27;d like to modify the client-side code to report back playback experience. That would have detected this problem much sooner, and it will protect me against CDN/network issues as well, which are particularly hard for me to get visibility into.<p>Thanks again to tankbot and alecthomas for helping me find this problem.<p>[1] The settings I ended up with, in case you&#x27;re curious:<p>Video encoding: H.264; 24 frames per second; 2250kbps max bit rate; &quot;High&quot; quality; Single-pass<p>Audio encoding: AAC; 44.1KHz audio (mono); &quot;Normal&quot; quality; 64kbps audio bit rate<p>[2] These thresholds are pretty conservative, and I&#x27;ll increase them if necessary. I like starting with low thresholds because it gives me more visibility into what&#x27;s going on, at the cost of requiring me to be a bit more hands-on until I get things dialed in.",1379983047

There are literally no access controls of any kind.  Anyone can walk on the street; billionaires and homeless alike.  There are no societal conventions that privacy is assured on the street and if you end up in someone else&#x27;s picture it&#x27;s your fault, not theirs.<p>Houses are not the street.  They are private property.  We do have a reasonable expectation of privacy there (NSA notwithstanding) and a part of privacy is access control.  So the right of the owner of a house to control access to his house is fairly well understood and accepted even in the case where a house might be unlocked or a door left open.<p>The real question is this:  Is the internet like the street or a house?  The answer, in my opinion, is that &quot;it depends&quot; because websites can act both ways depending on how they are designed and implemented.<p>HN is basically a street in that it has no access controls to view content.

I can view their promotional materials without any authorization but in order to get to the good stuff I have to enter both a username and a password, then pass a captcha.  That is an access control.<p>What is the case with the AT&T website?  Did they do anything to secure the content with a technological access control like a username/password?  Did they filter the service such that the webservice would only return an email address if it was accessed by the same MAC address of the iPad that was sold to the customer?  No, they did none of these things.  Their only &quot;access control&quot; was a user-agent string which isn&#x27;t guaranteed ANYWHERE to be accurate.<p>EDIT: changed a couple of words",1379981532

I had enough money in the bank to retire indefinitely, but instead of simply walking away my aim was take as big a cut of the pile as I could get it.<p>Five years later I was sick as hell of the work, so I did walk away but the opportunities in that niche were rapidly fading by that point.  There was probably less than a year&#x27;s worth of work left anyway.",1379981005

We were using Hetzner but we ran into issues when our server was the victim of a DDoS attack, and Hetzner responded by null-routing our server&#x27;s IP address for a few days. OVH has better DDoS mitigation strategies (supposedly), so that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re switching.<p>I&#x27;ve used AWS before in corporate work, and I have to say I was very unimpressed with it. The prices for what you get are exorbitantly high. I&#x27;ve heard people say &quot;they are affordable for corporate standards&quot;, but my reaction to that is just that their previous hosts were even worse about it. Every hosting solution I have had other than AWS has been cheaper.<p>More importantly to me than price though is the knowledge. I really don&#x27;t like that AWS is a &quot;black box&quot; of mystery meat. I don&#x27;t know how most of the systems are implemented under the hood, which means I can&#x27;t predict what the failure points are and what I&#x27;m implementing. The way I would compile capabilities of AWS systems together was through anecdotal information via blog posts. We would have servers fail and be given no explanation as to why. And many of the interfaces are proprietary, which means that moving to an alternative is not an option. Not to mention the APIs are not particularly stellar (a lot of XML). The only options for persistent storage are network drives and local disks that go away on shutdown, which is not a particularly good choice of options.<p>With OVH, I get a server. I know what a server is, how to back it up, and what its fail points are. If OVH does something I don&#x27;t agree with, I can move to another company and have exactly the same environment.<p>I&#x27;m not saying AWS is useless (again, I&#x27;ve used it for corporate environments before), but it&#x27;s hard to justify the high cost when you&#x27;re on a budget, especially when you can&#x27;t even determine if the tradeoff is worth it.",1379980976

6434958,comment,6433908,6434591,13,0,_dps,,,"> A job market is where you rent someone&#x27;s life; then you command them.<p>This seems like a one-sided and unproductively emotional framing. One could easily flip the emotional bias and say &quot;A job market is where greedy people with skills stubbornly refuse to volunteer their help unless they get paid for it.&quot; In fact, I suspect that&#x27;s exactly how some might characterize the &quot;job market&quot; for independent medical services where the employer is the patient.<p>Here&#x27;s my suggestion for a neutral take: a job market is a mechanism where people who are willing to take on responsibilities are paid money by people who would like to delegate responsibilities. The current dynamics of the academic job market (and many other markets for people with conventional liberal arts education) suggest that fewer people want to delegate those responsibilities, and more people are willing to take on those responsibilities. This is not a market-created problem, it is a social problem (i.e. we have somehow encouraged far too many people to invest in educations that don&#x27;t line up with current and near-future demand for responsibility-delegation).<p>As to your point about intrinsic antagonism: naturally, in any negotiation there is a zero-sum element <i>on the margin</i>, i.e. while we both benefit we can still argue over how the mutual gains are to be distributed. On the one hand, this is a valid point, and the asymmetry of leverage in this on-the-margin zero-sum negotiation between employers and employees is an excellent theoretical argument for labor regulations and labor unions. On the other hand, framing the labor negotiation as zero sum <i>overall</i> is, I believe, counter to even Marxist [0] analysis of labor relations.<p>[0] My lay understanding of Marxist labor relation theory is that it argues capital obtains the lion&#x27;s share of the mutual benefits (or &quot;surplus value&quot;) arising from delegation, but it does not argue that the exchange is what we would nowadays call zero-sum on an overall basis.",1379980926

Rather, they&#x27;ve figured out some ratio of power users to non-power-users (like the oft-repeated claim that 80% of the users only use 20% of the features but in Excel&#x27;s case I suspect the ratio is even higher) and they&#x27;ve decided to implement only the basic features used by non-power-users.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why Google bothers to have a &#x27;share an idea&#x27; forum when they have no intention of implementing the 80% features.

6434955,comment,6430753,6430753,2,0,dkersten,,,"I often hear that the best way to use AWS is to host your 24/7 stuff elsewhere and use AWS for the spikes. This makes a lot of sense, but I always wonder what the recommended (ie most cost-effective, especially in regards to bandwidth costs) place to host te 24/7 stuff? For example, moving a ton of data between EC2 and S3 is free (for bandwidth; ignoring requests costs), but moving 10TB out costs $0.12/GB which seems quite costly...<p>I guess the sweet spot is to use external hosting for your web apps and such and AWS for any large spike-prone batch processing: moving data into S3 is free (though obviously moving data out of wherever else you&#x27;re hosting probably isn&#x27;t), use EC2 to process it (possibly on spot instances!) and then move the results (which are much smaller than the raw data for a lot of use cases) back to the 24/7 hosts?<p>Though my question still remains: where do HNers recommend to host these servers knowing that AWS will be used to pick up the slack and handle irregular/unpredictable workloads?",1379980866

5042157,comment,5041999,5041999,1,0,lolcraft,,,"So, if I get this, the ""party line"" was that C++ is great because it's OOP -- never mind if it actually does not provide encapsulation or modularity. Or garbage collection. Or reflection. But now it is that C++ is great because it's not OOP, it's generic. It still does not provide encapsulation or modularity.<p>And all of this is derived from the design choice of making it not-even-compatible with C. To me, that's ideology.<p>That the compiler doesn't load a bunch of .o files does not mean there's no dependency graph. There is, it's just on header files, which makes things worse. You just moved the ""modularity"" from the linker/loader stage to the <i>compilation</i> stage. Which is the opposite of modularity. You can't modify a template with LD_PRELOAD. You can't have pluggable templates. If you modify a template, you have to recompile everything that uses it.<p>The STL never had to be efficient. It just had to be convenient. Anyway, you won't get efficiency from generic code, because <i>real efficiency</i> requires knowing <i>what's the problem you're trying to solve</i>.<p>I think Go got generics much better. Pass an interface{LessOrEqual} to a Sort and you're golden.",1357901263

I love building out the automated scripts and processes that take your code, build it, and deploy it to one of these.<p>2. Packaging software. I love writing Windows installers for all sorts of software, and even more so, developing tools and build scripts that actually <i>generate</i> installers.<p>3. Automating stuff. I love writing scripts and software to automate anything and everything, from simple Microsoft Word document processing, to more complex Node.js scripts to send out hundreds of email messages per second via Amazon SES.<p>CONTACT ME<p>You can contact me via email: nik@niksci.com or Skype: ndabas.<p>On a side note, I like using Elance as a project management and escrow platform, and you can check out my Elance profile (work history + client reviews) at <a href=""http://niksci.elance.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://niksci.elance.com/</a>.

I guess that depends on whether one believes that fast failures should be total and lead to abandonment or partial leading to adjustment.<p>A safe strategy for the counterparty to hmexx's incubator option is to produce a minimum MVP and go passive, letting hmexx do all the heavy lifting if he wants to move the project forward.<p>What I see is that a 50-50 incubator split doesn't align with the interests of either party.

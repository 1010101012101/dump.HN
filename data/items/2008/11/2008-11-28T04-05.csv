379106,comment,378852,378957,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yes, that's right. His relentless focus on the product keeps <i>your</i> focus on the product. And it sends the message you want to send about any product: This thing is so damned fascinating that you could spend all day playing with it.<p>Also, eye contact is subliminally threatening. That's probably not good for sales, particularly in a big city like New York, where a stranger who approaches you and makes eye contact activates the Shields Up response. (The odds that he is about to ask you for money are really, really high. Especially if he starts some big, rambling story instead of just immediately asking you for directions.) Moreover, scaring people is not something you want to do if you want to have a decades-long career, in one neighborhood, doing something that is technically illegal. One's first on-street encounter with a squatting, potato-obsessed geek with a knife in his hand is probably scary enough without having to know that <i>he's looking at you</i>.<p>Finally, I'd guess that eye contact is risky because it turns the show from a monologue into a dialogue. What if the mark starts an argument? Or runs away in terror? How would <i>that</i> play to the rest of the audience? Even a friendly chat could be bad for business if it takes up too much time that could be better spent running the spiel for a fresh set of passersby.",1227847844
379105,comment,378658,378671,0,0,randomwalker,,,"A big part of the problem is that Chaitin is a shameless self-promoter. He is the Bruce Schneier of Algorithmic Complexity. Actually, no, Schneier is not nearly as bad. Let me quote from the highest voted Amazon review of his book:<p>""Let the author speak for himself. From page 7, ""Gödel's 1931 work on incompleteness, Turing's 1936 work on uncomputability, and my own work on the role of information, randomness and complexity have shown increasingly emphatically that the role that Hilbert envisioned for formalism in mathematics is best served by computer programming languages[.]""<p>Imagine if a working composer wrote, ""Bach's preludes and fugues, Beethoven's symphonies, and my own string quartets have shown increasingly emphatically..."" This man's reputation in his declared field is nowhere near his apparent stature in his own mind. The ideas discussed in this book are worthy of late-night musings over a nice brandy, or maybe a Scientific American article, but only after extensive revision. They are not ready for publication in a monograph. """,1227847383
379104,comment,379035,379100,0,0,flashgordon,,,"actually it is interesting you say that... writing up a todo list is a good way of procrastinating, but I find that if i have a todo list (assume it was ""magically"" generated), it helps me get through work a lot faster...  atleast so that it helps me not loose the context when switching between tasks...<p>to this end ive found the MyLyn plugins for eclipse very useful.. creating the todo list is not too hard or tricky.. (though i found the creator page a bit clunky), and it even saves the state of the editor (ie open files, current line in the said open files etc) and loads the state as is each time you switch between items on the todo list (or tasks as mylyn calls it)..<p>I am sure there are much better tools out there like those widgets on google desktop and all but that is just another app you have to install..",1227847142

379099,comment,378658,379058,0,0,ars,,,"I see what you are saying, but think of it in reverse:<p>If the only way to prove or disprove Goldbach’s conjecture is to try every integer forever until you find a counter example (i.e. you can never stop - there is no point at which you can say, I checked enough numbers).<p>Then the same would apply to calculating BB(100) - you can never actually calculate the value of it - you never know if you have run it long enough.<p>That's my point: there might not actually be a value for large BB's. It is simply impossible to know if you need to keep running the machine or not. You can only set a lower bound. You can't, even in principle, ever calculate it.<p>So you can define the meaning of BB, but you can't calculate the value of it. If you can't calculate the value of it, then it has no defined value.<p>That's what I am trying to say - it is impossible, no matter how many (finite) resources you have, to calculate large BB's. There is never the point at which you can say: this program is not infinite.<p>Edit: I just read the wikipedia page on it, and I'm not saying something new: it's well known that BB is not computable, and point is that if it _was_ computable then you could use it to calculate Goldbach’s conjecture and others.<p>He really should have made the point a little clearer than you can't actually calculate the value of BB(100) - he made it seem like it was hard and needed massive resources, but not that it was impossible even in principle.<p>And finally, I say that since you can not calculate the value of large BB's - they are not actual numbers, and thus can not be used for his large number game.",1227846414

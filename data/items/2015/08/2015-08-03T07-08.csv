It doesn&#x27;t nearly cover your full experience but helps break problems down.<p>Do you find there is an analog to this with theorems? If so what&#x27;s the essentials from your &#x27;grab bag&#x27; and, beyond just reading more, what practices help build your feeling of where to use them?",1438588795

It&#x27;s practically de rigueur in fashionable intellectual circles. And in this case it&#x27;s so easy, an amateur like me can make a decent stab at it.<p>First of all, we enter the text with a remark about &quot;mistakes of ego&quot;. One ego mistake is to conflate &quot;life&quot; with some activity that is taken to be &quot;life-defining&quot; or &quot;the meaning of life&quot;. This is a Western preoccupation that stems from Christian spiritual angst with respect to the relationship between &quot;good works&quot; and salvation (this is very complex, see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_S...</a> for details and note the differences between the Catholic and Protestant teachings. The psychological implications of the doctrinal differences are far beyond my ability to untangle).<p>So here this is applied as follows: conflating life with the process of gaining salvation through good works which in a Capitalist society translates into &quot;game playing&quot; a.k.a. using capital to innovate and earn a return on investment.<p>Of course none of this helps when it comes time to contemplate mortality. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you play nor how many times you win, you&#x27;ll still be stuck with this over-developed existential angst which was the thing that prodded you to work so hard in the first place.<p>> When you lose a game of chess, you don&#x27;t go and jump off a bridge, you reset the pieces and do it again.<p>> It&#x27;s a game<p>The game playing, the &quot;reset the pieces&quot;, the conflation of life with the game, and the talk of suicide seem to suggest an element unacknowledged in the text, the idea of the cycle of death and rebirth. It may be a coincidence, but I think the attitude of the Buddhists with respect to this cycle may be connected with their attitude toward games vs. the process by which wisdom arises, but who knows?<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buddha_games"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buddha_games</a><p>OK, that&#x27;s my critique.

I love finding discussion on random websites I find.<p>This extension appears to be better made and has more features. It&#x27;s nice to see discussion on HN too.<p>It does not work reliably. I clicked on a bunch of links from the HN front page. Reddit check did find that they had been posted to reddit before, but Kiwi did not. However all of those links had only been posted once, and had no discussion. Still it seems strange it would say they had never been posted before.<p>It was also unable to find youtube videos that had been posted before. Youtube is terrible at unique URLs, and I don&#x27;t blame it. However Reddit Check is able to find all the different places youtube videos have been posted.<p>I found a link that had been posted to reddit hundreds of times. It only found 11 results. There was also an option for &quot;fuzzy matches&quot; which included a few more links to the exact same URL, but also links that had nothing to do with it. Reddit Check also has a problem where it only returns the first 25 results.<p>Clicking on any of the links closes the menu, so you can&#x27;t open many links in new tabs at once. This is also a problem with Reddit Check.<p>It does not find http versions of https links. Also a problem with Reddit Check.<p>Clicking on the &quot;submit to reddit&quot; option opened a submission page, but not with the URL in it.<p>I tried to look at the code but it was all squished together. It does not appear possible to modify it anyway.<p>Anyway none of these are dealbreakers. I will be using this extension alongside Reddit Check due to the extra features it has. I am concerned about sending so many requests to reddit every time I open a new tab though.",1438585328

However, there is a shortage of programmers (of X skill level) willing to work at the salary that a company desires. And that is where outsourcing and H1B comes in.  Having a larger pool of candidates (at X skill level) will force the local candidate pool to lower their asking salary. In turn, this will allow companies to keep salaries deflated and profits up.",1438585254

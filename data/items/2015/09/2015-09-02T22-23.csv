10162468,comment,10157729,10162123,0,0,asgard1024,,,"No, it&#x27;s an artificial distinction (or perhaps better would be to say, there is an artificial distinction where you decided that physics is not a social science). In both cases, you can analyze two scenarios:<p>1. Car continues and hits the person / investor won&#x27;t move money out before stock market crashes<p>2. Car is stopped / investor will move the money out<p>In both cases, the physics or economics is no less applicable whatever the circumstances of the actual decision. And just like physics cannot tell you whether the car stops, economics cannot tell you whether investors will actually move the money out. But what economics can tell you, under certain assumptions, say, investors want to make money with this and this horizon, whether or not are they likely to move out.<p>Let me give another example. Water flows downhill due to gravity. Yet, people can decide to build water pump and aqueduct to get water uphill. In doing so, they didn&#x27;t break any physical laws. But if you ignore the pump, it may seem that the water flow downhill anymore and so the laws are incorrect. What happened is that now our model of the situation should include the pump, and within the expanded model, physical laws are again preserved.<p>Similarly for instance, if the society decides to regulate markets, the behaviour of the people can be changed, but they don&#x27;t necessarily have to break some universal economic law. The new behaviour can have a perfect economic explanation, it&#x27;s just that the frame of the model changed.<p>It seems that this &quot;infinite regress&quot; confusion (also called Lucas critique, if I am not mistaken) is caused by ignoring the fact that every model of reality only includes a portion of it and is never a perfect description (for example we ignore the physics of human brain when we model the car hitting the pedestrian).<p>Also, you should note there are situations where knowing more doesn&#x27;t actually change the behaviour (under assumption of certain rationality) - for example, getting to know the exact odds of casino wins won&#x27;t entice me to play.",1441234600

Yes, the hides are important, but we also eat their flesh and use their bones for stuff. Cows are not typically skinned and then left in the field to be picked over. Also cow leather has a larger range of uses than I imagine seal skin/fur does: the latter is strictly a luxury item and I think that would be true even if there was unlimited sealing. In short, comparing seal hunting and cattle farming is maybe not as helpful as the article&#x27;s author would like.<p>I do think the outcry over sealing is because they are cute. As the article points out, they are not endangered. This also affects the comparison with whaling. The whales everyone was most concerned about in the 80s definitely were (are?) endangered, and with whale birth rates being much lower than seals (and cattle, and poultry), killing an individual whale would have a larger overall impact on the species.",1441234516

The message is shown on all internal pages (not the homepage) when ads are blocked and asks users to consider allowing ads for our site with a link to a page explaining how to ad an exception or making a donation to help keep us funded. The small message uses the same fonts and colors as the rest of the sidebar navigation so it&#x27;s not distracting and has CSS that reserves space for it in the event of ads being blocked so the content doesn&#x27;t jump at all and distract from reading a page.  I realize it&#x27;s a bit of an outlier case, of course, but many users do then allow ads or make a donation.  Granted our ads are bit less intrusive than many sites with only a single sidebar ad above the fold, no banner ad, no popouts/flyovers, no download button ads, no ads that autoplay sound, etc and many of our visitors are open source/free software fans.<p>For the curious, here&#x27;s a link to an internal page so you can see it in action with your ad-blocker active:

10162445,comment,10158782,10158782,0,0,NumberSix,,,"The article raised some questions about how much time to spend for free on the interview process and also on free work whether at the whiteboard or &quot;homework&quot; for an interview process.<p>Here are my thoughts and experience and rules of thumb.<p>A rigorous interview process is something like:<p>1. send resume or CV<p>2. half hour phone or sometimes video screening interview<p>3. one hour in person screening interview (optional)<p>4. all day interview or equivalent with at least three different people including the hiring manager (unless there are fewer than three people at the company).  This usually includes free lunch with the hiring manager and/or his team.<p>5. company checks references after the interview<p>A really rigorous interview is about 6-8 hours of the candidate&#x27;s time, generally without compensation except for travel and often free lunch during the day.<p>In most cases, a lengthy interview process like this means about a 1 in 2 or at worst 1 in 3 chance of getting an actual job offer.<p>My general rules are:<p>Avoid phone screening interviews longer than 30 minutes unless the employer is out of the area.  I once had a lot of 60 minute phone screening interviews that went nowhere.  My feeling is if the employer is serious about you and in your area, they can and should meet you in person for a longer screening interview.  Longer being over 30 minutes.  Despite the many limitations of interviewing, it is easier and more reliable to evaluate each other in person than on the phone or even by video conferencing.<p>It is reasonable for a potential employer to have a longer screening interview if they are going to pay to fly you to an interview, provide a hotel, etc.  Prefer a video screening interview to audio only if you can get a good video connection.  Prefer the phone if the video connection is poor.<p>The potential employer should at least pay for travel including air faire, rental cars, hotels, any public transit.  If they won&#x27;t pay, they aren&#x27;t serious and you should not pay for the trip either.  A per diem or reimbursement to cover meals is nice, but not everybody does this and I would not turn down an interview if everything else was covered.<p>If they want more than at most eight (8) hours of free work whether whiteboard or &quot;homework&quot; to evaluate you, they should pay for your time.  It should be a &quot;try and buy&quot; consulting project for them to get to know you and for you to get to know them.  It is not just technical competence, but how well do the two of you work together; that is generally a bigger concern than technical competence.<p>Actually, I would be very cautious about more than three (3) hours of free &quot;homework&quot; or actual coding (not whiteboard) that they could directly use.  If they are serious, they can pay a reasonable hourly consulting rate (e.g. $50-$100/hour) to try you out and vice versa.  That is not that different from the cost of the time to interview you in person or cover travel expenses.  If they won&#x27;t pay, they probably aren&#x27;t that serious and may simply be conning you to get free work.<p>In general, avoid doing work for free unless you get something else of lasting value to you from the free work such as something for your portfolio, lasting credit and recognition, or valuable experience you cannot get otherwise.   Cash is king.",1441234264

10162436,comment,10157600,10158928,0,0,dharmon,,,"Since no one has really answered your question, I will chime in.<p>Firstly, investing is a very personal thing. The style of investing you follow will depend very much on your temperament, investment timeframe, investable cash flow, time you are willing to commit, etc. Basically, you need an investment philosophy. I don&#x27;t know any shortcuts for this besides reading a ton of investment books. You can try Damodaran&#x27;s Investment Philosophy course lectures on YouTube. He&#x27;ll give an overview of the main investment flavors.<p>Here&#x27;s my &quot;process&quot;:<p>- I get ideas by reading a lot: Barron&#x27;s, WSJ, Fortune, as well as looking at various screeners such as low P/E stocks and companies trading at their 52-week lows. I am skeptical of large cap stocks in the billions, as those are picked over fairly well. Large funds have too much money they need to put to work to invest in a $250MM company, so analysts don&#x27;t follow them much. These are prime candidates for gaining an edge.<p>- Then I pull their annual (and quarterly) reports. The AR will give you a feel for the business, how it makes money, growth strategy, etc. A lot of times I don&#x27;t feel comfortable with my level of understanding and just bail. Sometimes I&#x27;m uncomfortable but keep reading for educational purposes, but in the back of my mind I&#x27;ve already firmly placed this in the &quot;pass&quot; category. I also start looking at the industry as a whole and competitors. I start to formulate an opinion on where the business is in general and what the key variables are. Again, the default here is to pass.<p>- Once I have a feel for the business, I start looking at the numbers, very roughly. Growth, margins, ROC, debt levels, and similar tell the truth about how good of a business this is. I especially look at how these numbers change over time. I look at free cash flow (FCF), but always in tandem with the companies reinvestment needs. More companies go in the &quot;pass&quot; bin during this stage for various reasons, e.g., high ratio of debt to FCF, where one hiccup and they&#x27;re toast.<p>- At this point I have a good business with what looks like good numbers, but I need to know a) can I get it for a good price, and b) why?<p>I figure out what I think is a fair value for the entire business at current conservative levels. I use DCF (you could use multiples I suppose), but I am purposely fuzzy on the numbers, e.g., I round a lot as a constant reminder that I do not know the future! I also play with the inputs (engineers might call it sensitivity analysis) to get a rough range of a fair value.<p>- I can then see what it&#x27;s actually trading for. This is why many of my initial filters look for 52-week low stocks and the like, cause otherwise you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time getting here just to see it&#x27;s trading for 2x what you think is a fair value.<p>- The 2nd half of the question, is why is this trading at what I think is a discount? The best candidate company is currently unloved for some reason. Your job is to figure out why.<p>- Now you are at a point where experience matters, and why Buffet tells his fans to read, read, read. Whatever reason this stock is currently depressed; is it temporary or permanent? If it&#x27;s temporary, will the company survive (even if things get worse)? You need some kind of edge or insight here, and your general business experience will guide your thinking.<p>I try to evaluate all possible outcomes and what my annual return will be in each case, and am looking for a margin of safety. Basically, even if things stay bad, will I end up ok? Your best luck here is some kind of safety net to prop up the value close to where you get in, like liquidation value (but be careful here). Think like a business-person.<p>More often than not, I have no special insight into the current environment and I pass. Every now and then, though, the market gets it wrong. This is your fat pitch and this is the time to swing.<p>- To keep this somewhat brief, I&#x27;ll just say there is a ton of nuance, so read books to get more ideas on what to look for. Also know what you&#x27;re looking at: analyzing Collector&#x27;s Universe (CLCT, $160MM cap) is different than analyzing Disney, with different investment timeframes, so certain things matter more than others. And both of these are different than looking at a net-net (what Buffet calls a cigar butt, or Graham-style stock).<p>As the above suggests, not many companies make it all the way through, and that&#x27;s ok. I read an interview with Mohnish Pabrai recently, and he said something very smart. He said the investor should act like a lady / gentlemen of leisure, casually reading each and every day, keeping an eye out for opportunity, but without the constant impulse to act.<p>As a beginner, you can even tell yourself as you begin reading that you are not investing, you are just learning. Keep investing in index funds while you learn. You may surprised when a juicy one comes your way.<p>As for reading, someone else gave some good recs, and you&#x27;re already reading Graham, so if you&#x27;ve decided &quot;value investing&quot; is for you, I would recommend<p>- Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits - Fisher. The &quot;scuttlebutt&quot; method for finding good companies. This is good advice in general for learning more about industries.<p>- One Up on Wall Street - Lynch. High level advice, but good stuff.<p>If these 2 and TII are a chore for you, then (value) investing is probably not for you. If you like them, then try these:<p>- Investment Valuation - Aswath Damodaran. The grandaddy of technical valuation. Basically the textbook on doing DCF.

When a unit is vacated (or the last tenant on the original lease moves out), the landlord is free to set the price of that unit however he wishes.<p>Rent control was instituted in a time when rents were spiralling out of control. [0] AIUI, one of the reasons Prop 13 passed was that landlords made the claim that a dramatic cap in property tax increases would allow them to stop dramatically increasing rents; that the primary reason for the rent increases <i>was</i> property tax increases. Prop 13 passed, rents continued to spiral out of control, [1] and about a year later rent control was instituted. [2]<p>If it was the city&#x27;s policy to construct enough new housing to meet demand, I would agree that rent control had no place in the market. However, in the past five years, for every five people added to the city&#x27;s population, one new housing unit has been added.

A few years ago, it seems that workers of ex-publicly  held companies (France Telecom for instance) were the most affected with a few suicide cases that made the news. Recent studies said 2 workers out of 10 felt affected.
IMHO, the white collars of big companies feel affected because they have to do more than before to stay in the international race in less time since they usually have 6-10 weeks of holidays per/year (no sick days).
Having so many holidays is really challenging for an organization, especially in the summer, period of the year when people are off for 2-4 weeks. It means also long work days for workers.
Personally i&#x27;d prefer to have less holidays and come back home earlier.<p>Having said that, on a yearly basis, white collars work much less than their American counterparts on average.",1441234112

It would probably make more sense to me.<p>From the description of MVCC that you say, it looks like you&#x27;re storing the whole replicated state machine that you have via the Raft protocol. If txs are assigned such a timestamp, I agree that could operate as a full MVCC system. Good.<p>Regarding the overlapping txs, it makes sense once you say you&#x27;re aborting txs. Without that, it sounded really difficult to achieve without locking.<p>When you say reads only check the switch if there is a write intent, where is exactly that &quot;switch&quot;? I understood it&#x27;s not with the key, but rather at some other random location. If that&#x27;s the case, I insist that you require two reads: one for the key, the other one for the switch. Os is the switch co-located with every key?<p>Regarding the aborted txs, I can&#x27;t argue without numbers, but I&#x27;d like to see those. I mean: you may abort txs voluntarily (I want to ROLLBACK) or involuntary (there&#x27;s a concurrent conflict). That may or may not be a high number. But all of those would be written to disk, so it might become a high price.",1441233428

I&#x27;m saying that people need to get over the idea that everything they dislike or disagree with is &quot;a tax&quot;.  It isn&#x27;t.  A state monopoly on fuel would be almost impossible to avoid, and you could reasonably assert that it&#x27;s a tax (there would be debate, but your position would be reasonable).  After all, even if you don&#x27;t yourself consume fuel, almost every product you could possibly buy has to be transported from somewhere, and most transportation services available today use fuel.  A lottery is nothing like that.  The product, such as it is, does not form a component of the cost of any other product.  All you have to do to avoid giving the state money is not play the lottery, which should be very easy since they are very up front about the fact that a ticket is not only -ev but much more -ev than any casino or cardroom game you could possibly play.  If people stopped playing, the state would either give up its monopoly or (in a classic monopoly-monopsony dynamic) cut its prices.

10162365,comment,10157775,10158148,0,0,hosh,,,"You&#x27;re confusing realism for presence. Realism is not necessary for presence.<p>I&#x27;m using the conventional notion of realism: that set of coventions, idioms, beliefs, habitual expectation that form your set of what is &quot;real&quot;. This is easy to test -- if you were to go to another country with a very different culture, some things will jar you out of your expectations. Other things like catastrophic natural disasters tends to shock people into paralysis because the thing going through their mind is &quot;this isn&#x27;t real&quot;. You see a tsunami coming your way, it&#x27;s real enough, but because you haven&#x27;t experienced it, you might spent some time wondering if this was &quot;real&quot;.<p>Presence, on the other hand, is the experience of being embodied within a space, whether that space is tangible or not. It is quite possible to have presence within an artificial space whose laws of physics do not resemble anything that you expect. Presence is typically attained when the uncanny valley is crossed. In other words, it&#x27;s the <i>brain</i> that needs convincing for the presence, not your expectations on what &quot;realism&quot; is.<p>If you are finding unrealistic elements are jarring, that&#x27;s more likely that the tech has not crossed the uncanny valley for you. There&#x27;s a strong case that the current generation of VR tech works well for men, but probably not women, due to physiological differences in neurology.<p>However, if the VR experience has presence, but things don&#x27;t operate the way you expect, that leads to a different experience: an existential crises.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to where this is going. Our civilization needs this tech badly, to help break us out of conventionality and closed-mindedness. Some of the most interesting project includes a VR sim of being in a warzone as a bystander ... to develop empathy for people elsewhere. That&#x27;s something the current social networks don&#x27;t foster. We still have difficulty seeing things from someone else&#x27;s point of view.<p>If the world wide web brought information closer together, the mainstream adoption of VR can potentially bring people together.

If you&#x27;re interested, you can find a complete rundown of our strategy here: (<a href=""https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md#lock-free-distributed-transactions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/de...</a>). However, that is a very terse document: this blog post was an attempt to expand on one of the basic ideas behind our design. My goal to clearly explain how we approach atomicity, without broaching the complicated topic of Isolation.<p>That said, I will attempt to address some of the pain points you raised:<p>* Cockroach does use a full MVCC system; writes are &quot;append-only&quot; and we keep the full history of values for each key. Keys can be queried at a timestamp, and every write explicitly specifies a timestamp as well (each transaction is assigned a timestamp, all writes will use the same timestamp). With this system, each transaction operates on a snapshot of the database.<p>* Our strategy for overlapping transactions is straightforward: if two concurrent transactions have a conflict, one of them will be aborted and retried. Write intents (in combination with another component, the &quot;read timestamp cache&quot;) are used by conflicting transactions to discover each other. Once discovered, the decision of which in-progress transaction gets aborted is deterministic - each transaction is assigned a random integer &quot;priority&quot;, and the transaction with the highest priority always wins the conflict (unless one of the transactions has already committed).<p>* Every read does need to check the switch <i>if the key being read has a write intent</i>; reads of plain values (with no in-progress transaction) do not need to check a switch.<p>* Yes, aborted transactions can write intents to the database in our current system.  However, the second &quot;write&quot; (consolidation) happens asynchronously, and is not required for the transaction to function correctly. It should only be noticed if the key is accessed again by another transaction before it is consolidated. For committed transactions, I don&#x27;t believe this is a particularly high price to pay.<p>A system that doesn&#x27;t write aborted transactions to disk would be considerably more complex; I think it would involve two commit phases (I. The transaction has been &quot;committed&quot; in memory, and can no longer be aborted by other transactions II. The transaction must successfully commit all changes to disk in an atomic fashion). You likely could get some additional performance (if disk latency is a sufficient bottleneck), but it would be hard won in terms of complexity.",1441232372

There are many things wrong with state-run lotteries, but they&#x27;re not a tax.  If you don&#x27;t like the way the lottery is priced, don&#x27;t play.

The main points:<p>1) Set aside an option pool (e.g. 10% of issued equity) so you don&#x27;t need to go back to investors to approve each new grant.<p>2) Think about how employees value equity.  If someone values equity at zero, or much lower than how you value it, then maybe pay them x more cash instead of equity (where x>0).<p>3) For senior hires or others who you expect to contribute materially to the success of the business, make sure the equity is meaningful.<p>4) Everyone&#x27;s equity (even some of yours) should vest over time (e.g. 4 years).  Exception: equity which is paid for with cash money, like external funds.<p>5) Think about what you will do if someone underperforms, but isn&#x27;t terrible.  If an employee is doing their job well enough that you don&#x27;t want to fire them, but much less well than when you decided how much equity to grant them, what will you do?  (Distinguish this from the case when the equity rises in value significantly, so everyone&#x27;s vesting looks generous.  That&#x27;s great, and fair compensation they took on as early employees.)<p>6) Get proper advice about the tax stuff in your country/state.  Google stuff like &#x27;qualifying options&#x27;, &#x27;409a valuation&#x27;, and the different tax implications of granting options vs. restricted stock vs. stock with a repurchase agreement.<p>Those are the general things to consider.

I would hope that both sides could be a little more accommodating: Western countries allowing disadvantaged refugees safe harbor, and Muslim immigrant communities willing to adapt somewhat to Western standards. There is actual research done on integration in these communities, above and beyond this single poll that you&#x27;ve been hanging on to. [2] Despite what you insist on believing, immigrants do actually adapt to their environments.<p>Lastly, you seem to want to paint the issue as cut and dry: put special restrictions on entry for Muslims, and social conflict won&#x27;t arise between people who have differing values. That doesn&#x27;t solve any issues! What do you do about disaffected Muslim communities already in Western countries? What is the best way to ensure a harmonious society? I think the answer lies somewhere between your claims of &quot;don&#x27;t let them in&quot; and &quot;let them all in and Sharia law will come to the West.&quot; Instead of castigating existing Islamic communities and placing restrictions on them, why not give them a fair shake and see what happens?

It's one of many.  It's a proxy.  It's quick.<p>- This chart uses 2011 financial data.  Facebook is growing fast - their multiples would come down significantly if we used 2012 projections - which we don't have.

So just looking at the data quickly, I was disappointed that FB appeared to have higher multiples (his blog post: <a href=""http://bhorowitz.com/2011/03/24/bubble-trouble-i-don%E2%80%99t-think-so/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bhorowitz.com/2011/03/24/bubble-trouble-i-don%E2%80%9...</a>)<p>- DAYAM FB has a crazy operating margin<p>- And they're getting better at monetizing each user.

I don't know whether that's true anymore if it ever was<p>It used to be true. XFS has for a long time been the very fastest real filesystem available when it comes to moving data, and one of the slowest ones in real-world use when it comes to changing metadata. Untarring a kernel tarball a second time (on top of the first) is pretty much the canonical benchmark for metadata operations, and the one where XFS used to be at it's absolute worst.<p>XFS is in the news right now exactly because they have fixed that deficiency. It's still faster than ext*, zfs and btrfs in pretty much everything else, but now it's comparable to them when modifying metadata.<p>So this is exactly the right benchmark to use, because it's the one where there has been recent change.<p>Video of Dave Chinner presenting this at linux.conf.au: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FegjLbCnoBw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FegjLbCnoBw</a>",1328198196

3543147,comment,3541932,3542985,1,0,bermanoid,,,"<i>In my opinion it's not a matter of definition, it's a matter of understanding a real type of phenomenon.</i><p>That's fine, and there very well may be some issues here that are worth investigating that don't just involve figuring out a definition. But your specific questions, ""What makes something computation"", and ""What is it about a physical process that means it is performing computation?"", both hinge on a blurry notion of ""computation"" that needs to be pinned down before they can even be taken on.<p>Because if we take the first definition of the word from Google, ""The action of mathematical calculation"", then the answer is pretty trivial: a physical process is performing a computation if the states of the physical system reliably map to the result of a known mathematical operation, no more, no less. Now, we may quibble over what is a <i>useful</i> computation, whether a computation is happening if we don't observe it, etc., and that's the kind of tightening of focus that's necessary to get any answers in these situations. Those tightenings are not implicit in the word ""computation"".<p>This is a typical philosophical problem - questions like ""what is consciousness?"" and ""what about a physical process makes it conscious?"" may be answered in a straightforward manner by going to the dictionary (google (Define consciousness) -> ""The state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings""), but answers along those lines reliably fail to satisfy philosophers because they don't <i>actually</i> mean ""The state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings"" when they use the word ""consciousness"", they're using some personal tightening of the term that carries a lot of unspecified baggage (or perhaps they'll hide this baggage in ""awake"" or ""aware"", which just shifts the issue). Arguments then ensue about the <i>right</i> definition of the word, the one that matches the ""know it when I see it"" feeling that each person involved has about it, and little progress is made because nothing is pinned down concretely enough to actually discuss.",1328198192

3543044,comment,3541142,3542840,1,0,dangrossman,,,"I think you, and others, underestimate the enormity of the revenues the movie studios are generating.<p>The MPAA represents 6 studios that produced about 15% of theatrical releases last year. They only released 12 of the top 25 movies in theaters too. The MPAA studios alone generate about $40 billion in revenue a year; I didn't try to add up all the other studios, but you can imagine the total revenue is enormous. What they spend lobbying for these laws is a pittance in comparison.<p>Total box office gross was $32 billion last year. Let's be generous and say the MPAA got 50% of the box office sales despite having less than 50% of the top movies. That leaves $24 billion in revenue from their films each year not including the theater releases. That's $24 billion from physical discs, licensing to cable providers, licensing to TV channels, licensing to premium cable channels, licensing to the existing streaming services, etc.<p>If the MPAA studios launched a streaming service at $50 per month, this would displace most of their revenue from other distribution models -- people would buy far fewer DVDs and they simply wouldn't get the agreements with cable networks, premium channels, etc. if customers can already get the movie from this website a month after theater.<p>To make up for that revenue they would have to find 480 million subscribers at $50. Do you think they can? I doubt it at that price point; that's more than most people spend on movie consumption across all channels now. Even if they could do it, those 480 million subscribers would only replace the revenue of the 6 MPAA studios, not the other 85% of the movie production market.<p>Whenever I see a ""why don't they just give us what we want and stream everything like Netflix"" suggestion, I see ""why don't these companies just burn 85% of their profits"", because that'd be about the same as far as their financials go.",1328196846

Amdahl, various concerns raised by physical distribution present the proverbial hair in the ointment:<p>- CAP applies. If the requirement is for a highly-available and highly-consistent system, then scaling up is preferred as we can do away with the 'P' concerns altogether.<p>- Higher latencies are a given. Realtime distributed e.g. map/reduce algorithms are beyond the reach of most.<p>- Certain e.g. graph constructs are difficult to partition. A single node compute engine that can scale up <i>may</i> turn out to be the more economically attractive option.<p>> <i>My belief is that having a highly connected sea of general purpose compute engines, and some additional tools to factor algorithms along their entanglement borders into partial computation fragments will radically change the way things get done.</i><p>Right, so we're in agreement here (and I personally love to geek out thinking about that stuff) but with the caveat that such tools do not exist and it is not clear at all that the interface that will be provided to the end-user (read: your average programmer) will remain accessible.<p>1 - Not everyone can ""[think] like a vertex"" so Pregel is very nice indeed, but who will be coding for it? Where are these programmers being cranked out and how much will it cost me to hire and retain them?<p>2 - Not everyone can (afford to) manage a realtime m/r infrastructure (like Facebook).  [Oddly enough, there was recently a cry to revolution here by PG regarding the chokehold of ""Hollywood"" which imho effectively boils down to distribution -- any one can make content these days.]<p>3 - And a subset of above will not want to trust a 3rd party provider to manage the required infrastructure.<p>4 - (Subjective) I remain sceptical of the computation efficiencies of the current models which rely on high degree of redundancy and lots and lots of boxes.  You must know quite about this (per your HN bio), so I would like hear your thoughts on that.  Assume that tomorrow, the cost of running the HVAC and powering up the boxes goes through the roof.  What approach to computation will provide the most efficient compute-engine?  Let's flip this to physical delivery systems (to highlight the given /fixed cost/ of running a unit-engine) and consider what is more efficient: having a huge number of small cars deliver goods, or using trucks?  (You may counter that ""well, it is cheaper to train and hire n truck drivers than N mini drivers, but driverless cars will turn that equation upside down"".  If so, then see 2,3 above.)<p>In sum:<p>Not every company is Google/Facebook/Amazon -- with the attendant wealth of capital and human resources of these giants.<p>Further, not every computation need can be trusted to corporations.  Some of us haven't given up on data privacy and insist on it. There are critical ""social"" applications that need to be written and most certainly Google, Facebook (and may be even) Amazon are not trustworthy enough to host them.<p>Solving this at the hardware/OS level, imho, will be the more democratic way forward and will take it out of the user/devop land (where it is being addressed at the moment).  After all, wasn't that what the PC revolution was all about? We did, after all, already have mainframes and dumb terminals way back when.  And this back to the future of cloud and running m/r batch jobs is not democratic at all.<p>So I am personally rooting for the (future commodity) H/W solution to this problem.  Naturally, my 'biases' are clear per above.",1328196637

Firstly theres no entry barrier, young people from all backgrounds come and kids that don't have laptops we try have spares to let them use. Money we found generally complicates things (where is it going, is there transparency, some locations start wanting rent money, etc). Some people find it hard to grasp also, but free youth activities in Ireland are extremely common.<p>Regarding abuse, people using it as a glorified babysitting service, etc. We have a rule that if a kid is 12 or under, they must have a parent or guardian there responsible for them. As we're extremely over booked (waiting list of 200 in Dublin), we reserve spots for extremely interested kids, who keep coming back and producing things and leave other slots open. If a kid is being disruptive and won't stop, we tell the parent to calm them down (Extremely useful when working with kids that have autism as some have behavior issues that parents can address there and then)or to take them home.<p>To date, running it for free has worked extremely well and in every Dojo, theres been little, if no issues. People are volunteering, giving up their time for free and volunteers are normally blunt with parents if its being abused.<p>We try to remove as much financial dependency from CoderDojo so its easier to set up anywhere and run, individual Dojos can arrange donations or sponsor if they want.

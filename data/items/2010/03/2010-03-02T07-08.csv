1160853,comment,1158589,1160690,0,0,mquander,,,"I would agree with your first paragraph if we were all strictly rational machines.  But I think that the key to long-term progress and success is to give people the greatest degree of freedom possible, combined with incentives (i.e. salaries, grants, awards) toward things that help society.  When you start stigmatizing or punishing people for choices that aren't even bad -- they just aren't ""good enough"" -- then there's no way that won't backfire and just instigate (rightful) resentment and anger.<p>I really would not be frustrated that Superman was not doing superhero stuff.  It's very hard to herd someone smart or capable into doing something they don't genuinely want to do, and I doubt it's usually productive in the end.<p>I have to admit, I take this personally, because I may not be Superman, but I sit around writing little stories that nobody but me will ever read, reading books that do little practical good but to fill me with a sense of beauty and contentment; I shoot some pool, play some chess, and I work on software that exists primarily to satisfy my curiousity or to make me money.  Most of it doesn't help anyone else very much, and I like it that way.  I think I have the right to do whatever I please, as long as I take care of myself and my friends without doing harm to other folks on the planet.

I've written parts of Unix/Linux virtual memory, network stacks, process management, threads, interrupt handlers, synchronization primitives, TTY line disciplines, various kinds of device drivers.  I've debugged parts of block I/O systems, file systems, NFS client and server, CPU schedulers.  I feel like I understand those.<p>There are things I don't understand.  I don't know the I/O architecture of a PC nor how the OS integrates with the BIOS.  I don't know how the subdirectories of linux/drivers/ are organized, even at the first level.  I've never designed a filesystem, and suspect there are subtleties I don't appreciate.<p>I never bought Bill Gates' testimony during US vs Microsoft that an operating system includes its web browser.  In my arrogant opinion, an OS starts and ends with the kernel.  So the next question is, how much do I understand about the rest of the platform?  It varies.<p>I do know how the X11 protocol works, how the classic X server worked, how Xt intrinsics work.  Do understand the classic Unix utilities and libc and their modern GNU reimplementations.<p>Don't know how an RDBMS works inside.  Haven't kept up to date with compiler optimizations.  Don't know how debug info is stored in object file and executables or even exactly what it is.  Don't have any idea how that huge pile of libraries in GNOME (or KDE) is organized.  Have only a vague idea of how the current X server is organized.<p>Even though the last (and first) time I implemented a page fault handler was 1986, I feel like I understand what they have to do, why, and what data structures they need.  I'm sure the specifics are very different in any of today's OSes than they were in 4.3BSD, but I don't think that matters.  OTOH, I think most of my graphics knowledge is obsolete.<p>So, in sum, I partly understand my OS. (-:",1267516023

All of the anecdotes I've heard indicate that Google, Amazon, Facebook, and others weigh formal qualifications heavily in the case of an anonymous resume. Many of Google's job listings state a preference for an MS or higher.<p>I think at high profile companies like that, where thousands of unsolicited resumes are received every day, strict formal educational requirements is a necessary way to pare down resumes queued for review.<p>At lesser-known companies, the qualifications are generally much looser, mostly focused on a demonstrable background with applicable technologies.

Even if there are well-intentioned investors and helpers out there, I just assume that there's no point in preparing a custom big long proposal for them because they are flooded with so many other candidates that I will be ignored. Sometimes I send short feelers to people involved in things like this to see if I can actually get through, but these messages are (so far) always ignored.<p>Since this is Hacker News, I'll mention YC specifically.

I'm not a great marketer or salesman, but I can't get great marketers or salesmen as one of the masses posting vague promises about equity, especially not in ""bad"" job markets.<p>I've listened to a couple episodes of the recent set of podcasts on traction. To me, the gist of each one has been ""get lucky"" (i.e. noticed by Google or Mozilla) or ""get money"" (i.e. get a big or famous investor).<p>Meanwhile, it's frustrating to read of successes others achieve. Not because I'm not happy for them, just because it seems like many, many others, even those with what I feel are far worse ideas or skills, are able to grasp whatever I'm missing here, and get money and be not poor.<p>So what should I do? I know there are a lot of investors and founders here. I feel like there are probably others like me. Can anyone offer advice besides general platitudes? I know that the line is ""just keep trying"", but I've kept trying for a long time and it doesn't seem to work out.",1267513413

It just looks like a big ""Internet Drama"" piece:-/  I'm sure it's important to those involved, but it really doesn't affect my life.",1267513337

Yahoo's search engine is still their own and will be for the next couple of years.<p>The Bing deal is actually a very odd beast, and I'm not sure if I like it, but I will say this: Carol Bartz asked for and got a 88% revenue share. This is unheard of, like getting the Devil to cosign your mortgage.<p>Whatever you think of the deal, it's not a) a surrender and b) actually implemented yet. I realize that it is hard to make an informed comment when a snide remark will do. But give them a break, eh?",1267513329

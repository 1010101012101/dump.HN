4207232,comment,4205553,4206615,5,0,lloeki,,,"> People love to cite drugs as being a case where patents work well. But patents are far from a perfect fit for this problem.<p>Bringing drugs in the discussion has more of a relative role than any absolute metric though. We could subsume the reasoning as such though:<p><pre><code>    - patents work better on drugs than on software by leaps and bounds
    - patents are far from a perfect fit for drugs
    - it follows that software patents are an atrocity of abysmal scale</code></pre>",1341572362

True Pythonistas, when performance is critical, just drop into C for the crucial section and use Python to control it. When C code is running, the Python runtime isn't blocked - you can kick off a hundred native pthreads in the background if you want to.<p>This is also true in OCaml BTW, but it's trickier to make the call as when running single-threaded, OCaml code is as fast as C anyway.

If you are the odd one out telecommuting, then yes, issues arise.<p>But, anecdotal evidence to the rescue, here is my personal experience:<p>I work for a US-headquartered software company. I live in Austria. I lead a product team. My team members live in France and Germany. We <i>all</i> telecommute. We see each other in front of clients or at organized internal events. The rest is done through various online solutions.<p>Everyone is on equal footing. I, as a manager, am a telecommuter myself. I can relate, understand how to measure performance as I am measured this way myself.<p>Do <i>I</i> have a disadvantage against the colleagues in the US HQ? Absolutely, but they cannot do my job as I cover Europe. Which is fine. My team has no drawback.<p>And yes, by now, I am a strong advocate of tele-work for knowledge workers. A lot of reasons, but often overlooked is the ecological one. I actually use my home more. I don't have a separate office that sits around empty (still heated/ac'ed) for non-working hours. I don't waste energy hauling my physical presence back and forth to work. And yes, my company saves a metric ton of money on office space savings.",1341572031

4207216,comment,4205967,4206059,3,0,pwaring,,,"""You work from home so you can put in 2 hours work, accomplish as much as anyone else did""<p>Agreed. I'm the only technical person in the company - if I went into the office every day I would spend half my time being asked to fix printers, 'can you just take a quick look at this?' etc. which would kill my productivity.<p>The other problem for me with 'being seen' is that I spend a lot of my time planning relative to writing code - e.g. for a major project I might spend half the time thinking about how to break down the problem into chunks which can be dealt with individually, then chaining them together for the final result. From an outsider's point of view, it would look like I was just sitting at a desk doodling all day. So it's actually better for me to announce a new feature every so often, because that output looks productive, whereas the process of producing it doesn't.<p>Having done home and in-office working, I've found that if it's a company of engineers (including managers with that background) then I prefer working the office, because I get to converse with like-minded people, and they understand that sometimes days can go by without churning out vast quantities of code. If I'm working for a company where the technical side is less central, then working from home tends to win out.",1341571905

4207174,comment,4206673,4206954,15,0,zitterbewegung,,,"Think of it like this.<p>What if you represented your computer bits as a arrow on a compass. You have also the plane that the compass is on.<p>The arrow points in one direction for 1 and in another direction for zero.<p>Regular computation would have you doing operations on bits. You could only do one operation at a time on one bit and you are able to flip them given a recipe.<p>A probabilistic computer allows you to do some special things. For example you have this magical random source where you can add a magic variable. This magic variable is a random variable. This is used in the following algorithm. We call it fermats little theorem.<p>Given a prime how do we test its primality? We would have to at minimum divide each number lower than itself? (there are optimizations I am glossing over for this exercise).<p>What if we use this magical random variable. It can be a number from 0 to a natural number?<p>If we have a few other algorithmic tools we can make a probabilistic search of a array.
With a random variable we can do the following operation<p>findingA_LV(array A, n)
begin
    repeat
        Randomly select one element out of n elements.
    until 'a' is found
end<p>This will search a array A randomly and works with probability 1 (this is very important... if your probability is 0 then you probably don't have a working algorithm ;) )<p>Whats the advantage? Well, instead of having a sequential search of an array you can randomize the search. The probability of success is 1! So, if we are really lucky we could win very fast. If the array is SMALL then that might be even better right? If the array has one element then we will always win but thats not fun :(<p>But, a more useful example is the fact that quicksort with a randomized sort can get FAST {O(nlogn)}<p>Now, lets make a quantum leap. Lets go faster than FAST. Lets go ridiculous.<p>Lets say that we have a new magical bit. People call it the qubit. The more you have the better you are off.<p>Superposition can be described as follows. You can correlate two qubits together magically. Algorithmically no one cares how . On the Engineering side the ability to do this is worth trillions of dollars though.  The advantage has the following feature.<p>If we want to factor a number we can do it faster than any known classical algorithm. By classical I mean following the rules of your standard computer.<p>Quantum computers allow you to BREAK the rules of classical ones. They do this by doing the following things.<p>Lets review the two computers we have discussed before.<p>The first kind of computer is called a Turing Machine or a Recursively Enumerable Language / Problem. This basically follows rules due to a finite control (a CPU basically) and has a tape which you can write to, go left or right.<p>The second kind of computer has the magical randomness. This is a randomized algorithm. If you are feeling lucky you might get lucky and this reduces your runtime. In the average case you probably win more often than you lose hopefully.<p>Our magical quantum compuer allows for correlation of two or more ""variables"" (called qubits) . How is this better?<p>In quantum physics when you observe a particle you ""collapse its wave state"". This is making an observation. This is analogous to a return variable in any C like language. The difference is how it returns and while in your function it does some magical things.<p>The magic is as follows. A qubit can be observed in something called a computational basis. What does that mean? It means you make two vectors in the ""plane"" or the ""complex plane"" or basically you have a 3d arrow that points wherever you want. They call this the bloch sphere.<p>With this magic you can do magic tricks. This magic trick is called sorting a UNSORTED database in O(sqrt(n)). This sounds ridiculous right?<p>You are performing operations that are LESS than the size of the array...  You aren't LOOKING at every entry.<p>This is ridiculous. How do they do this?<p>Instead of thinking of the database as an array think of it as a function.<p>We are trying to invert the following function. Encode all of the elements of the database as a vector in an ""n-dimentional state space"" this will require a logarithmic amount of qubits.<p>Given a function which returns true or false if the element is there you can write an algorithm that searches it using superposition EXTREMELY fast O(sqrt(n))<p>It works by creating a correlation between the state space or basically all of the qubits are correlated together. Then you start rotating all of the qubits. Since they are tied to a function which tells you if they are equivalent to your target variable then this requires sqrt n operations to do so. They correlate this by doing a ""uniform superposition"" or entangling all of the elements and then you start rotating the state space to get what you want.<p>Thats why we want these things. They are just faster. They break rules but they are hard to build.<p>References

A well known model in my country was a good friend (long time ago) and she wore glasses in school; outside she would never wear them (this was long before digital cameras/phones, I think in this day/age she would just not at all wear them) because she thought they sucked. I thought she looked way better in them. But maybe that's just my fetish :)",1341569393

It was one (of many) reasons I live in nature; I don't really mind people taking pictures/videos with me accidentally in it, but it's too much to know that i'm getting recorded somehow 24/7 with every step outside my house. I saw the number of camera's in Amsterdam grow rapidly; both government and consumer. I don't give <i>that</i> much about privacy but this is just a bit over the top.<p>Then again, I never thought about it, because the goal of Glass is exactly the very LAST thing I would use Glass for. I don't take pictures as it is and doing it from my POV doesn't seem interesting at all. What I want is being able to walk (and sit without getting my mobile office out) and do some (!) work. Like for instance when I have team meetings via Skype and I need to see occasional demos and slides, there is NO reason at all why I cannot do that on the move. If I can walk through the mountains and occasionally look up/right or wherever to see a slide or screen, it would allow me to do a LARGE % of my daily work in nature while walking. And I see a lot more things which can be done <i>now</i> with Glass without needing complex and weird human interaction.<p>And when you need to do something real, you just sit down, flip open a tiny computer (openpandora is my poison) which you connect to the glasses (for instance, via VNC which is the most obvious option) and presto you have a full screen without opening some big laptop or disturbing the peace with (power) cables etc, nor do you appear to stare into a laptop in public; you never have to actually look at the pandora to do your work.",1341569249

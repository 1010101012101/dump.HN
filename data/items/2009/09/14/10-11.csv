It's a good thing!<p>You can argue all you like about whether they made good technical decisions but be angry that they released some code for free is just odd.<p>Sometimes people re-write already existing things, sometimes it's a good idea, sometimes it's a bad idea, sometimes it seems like a good idea at the time. Sometimes it works out quite well so it doesn't matter either way :p",1252925964
821444,comment,821365,821365,0,0,mahmud,,,"In the words of the great Walter Sobchak: ""you're entering a world of pain"".<p>The best advice I can offer you is to wrap up your application's functionality into a clean library that could be made into remote services (RPC, SOAP, CORBA, COM, etc. or preferably JSON-RPC or XML-RPC) then make a a VMWare image (or similar) virtualization tool of the app and its environment. You could still use the code that way from any platform, but it's pretty much stagnant and all new improvements and extensions will either have to be made on Win32, or as external interface wrappers to augment a limited shell.<p>Code reuse was already hard enough, but the RAD tools and IDEs made it considerably so. You can't believe how many shops keep Visual Studio 6.0 installation just to build their projects, because later version of VS frobbed the building process and screwed up old resource files.<p>I dread to think of the future that awaits stuff running on the Java stack that can't be built without tools from now defunct vendors.",1252925951

821434,comment,819942,821397,0,0,lsc,,,"saying there is no such thing as objective value is like dodging any other philosophical question with a 'but can you prove reality is as it seems?'  While in philosophy class you have a point, I can't define 'objective value' in the philosophical sense any more than I can prove I'm not a butterfly dreaming that I am a man, but I think that says more about philosophy than it says about the concept of objective value.  If you want to actually do something real, you must move past word games.  All men are 9/10ths empiricists.  I know what I mean when I speak of objective value.

Unfortunately that's pretty much completely been lost, which I guess to some extent because some of it was too hard to be realistically accomplished with limited resources and time (pulling your account data with software controlled by you rather than giving Wesabe your account password).<p>The core app itself has gotten continually worse. The ""v2"" that launched some months ago now was less usable, removed functionality (which may have been restored by now to some extent), was full of bugs, and was glacially slow and balky.<p>The only possible draw for Wesabe over Mint is the ""community"" part, which never interested me.<p>I guess I really see Wesabe as a money-management community with an app attached, not as a money-management app.",1252924262

I can probably compete with the best SysAdmins my competitors hire.  Yeah, some of them are better than I am, but it's at least a contest, you know?  I'm not completely outclassed.  I have a fighting chance.<p>Put me up against the best marketing guys my competition can hire, though, and I'll be humiliated.  I'm just not very good at manipulating emotions, so I'm better off if it appears that I'm not trying.<p>That, and I still don't believe I'm leaving money on the table.  my growth rate right now, (a bit over a server a month)  is probably about optimal.  It's fast enough to be exciting, but it's slow enough to be not overwhelming.   The hardware margins are fine;  a full server more than pays for itself in two months.  Really, any more than that is just silly.<p>I think what I need to be focusing on now is automating the bits of support we are currently (badly) doing by hand, that is, provisioning and re-sizing domains.  Next, I think, backups, as that's the biggest threat right now.   Data-loss events are horrible.",1252924032

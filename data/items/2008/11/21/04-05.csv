You can convert solar energy into carbohydrates, extract the carbohydrates and convert them into ethanol, transport the ethanol to thousands of gas stations (sitting on prime commercial real estate), and combust it to create pressure that's harnessed to rotate an axle. There's a significant percentage of waste at each of those steps, and you end up requiring, like, all of the Earth's surface area for growing biofuel crops. (Even with algae.)<p>Alternately, you can harness sunlight directly, distribute it across the existing grid (fairly unobtrusively), temporarily store it in batteries or capacitors, and directly power an electric motor with it. Electric storage also benefits from the same economies of scale as laptops and cell phones.<p>My opinion, a humble one, is that biofuels are better suited for niche applications where electricity can't be used.",1227243513

It's hard to see what it's like at the bottom if you're on top and there's dozens of layers between you and the people that actually get their hands dirty. It's even harder if you've done this job for years and have no idea how things have changed since you rose in the corporate structure, if you were even at the bottom to begin with. It's a perennial problem in large groups with hierarchical structure, and GM is one of the largest and most hierarchical groups out there.<p>What may seem to them as being a ""go-getter"" and exercising earned corporate privilege just makes them seem even more elitist and out-of-touch to the general public.<p>It reminds me of the importance of the consigliere in the Italian Mafia (or at least in the fiction surrounding it). You need a close friend that you can trust to tell you what is right rather than what you want to hear. If you don't have a way to back up and see the big picture, you won't be able to see trouble until it's staring you in the face, no matter how dangerous it may be.<p>Every time I hear of something like this, I remind myself to always be aware of the echo chamber that may be surrounding my own life and its affairs. What I think is real could very possibly be wishful fantasy.",1227242894

The idea that site operators have to be responsible for the live-feed user-content on their sites is absurd.   Yes, this kid killed himself, but if I was the CEO of justin.tv I wouldn't feel bad for the kid.  I'd feel bad for the tarnished name of my company.  Honestly, people commit suicide ALL THE TIME.  And it sucks.... for their friends and family, but suddenly it's broadcast across the internet and I'm supposed to have an interest in this specific incident?<p>But this story is a sensationalized love-in because other people witnessed the 'suicide'. I'm certainly not calling 9-1-1 every time I read a post trolling some web forums.  99% of the internet is NOT serious business.  Most of the internet is people trying to piss each other off and cause trouble.<p>Honestly, the best this CEO can hope for is if people forget his company was involved, and worse case is the family ends up on Opera bemoaning how horrible the internet is and calling the CEO out to get involved in suicide prevention and better moderate his company's web properties.<p>_This story shouldn't be about how the internet is a cruel place that forced someone to kill himself.  It should be about the real world being so cruel that not a single person in this kid's life cared enough to notice his problems._",1227242877

As much as we like to think that it's all about the code, these public perception things matter. Ill-considered comments - and even well-meaning comments that have the tone-deaf dissonance of stock boilerplate - have a direct, adverse effect on the public's image of your company. If you run a company like Justin.tv, that should matter to you, regardless of your personal feelings about the suicide itself.

They then displayed (and still do) chunks of the books for free, again without permission from rights holders. I have read multiple pages of my book there.<p>That seems to me just as much a violation of copyright law as having Daily Show clips on Red Lasso was. They're certainly not exempted as a service provider under the DMCA when they're uploading the content themselves.<p>As an author, I'm not opposed to this if I'm given the right to opt out, and I'm compensated for any sort of AdWords type stuff run along side it. But many authors will be, and Google didn't ask us or give us a way to opt out.<p>For me personally, I think it benefits me to have sections of my book there, so I'm happy about it. But I can certainly see why some authors wouldn't care for that at all, and it's not up to Google to decide how those rights holders' property can be used.<p>I talked to a former attorney who is now a literary agent (and who therefore may be biased) back when the suit first appeared and he said it was pretty much an open and shut case and that it was just a question of how much Google was going to lose.",1227242590

Ruby is a high productivity language, Java not so much.  The JVM is a very well engineered run time engine, Ruby's MRI not so much.  Unicode, threading, fast, reliable, portable, well understood and supported.  Pluses for Java, minuses for Ruby.<p>So in principle it seems JRuby could have the best of both worlds.

371495,comment,371349,371349,0,0,jyothi,,,"As many have posted below there is more to Adwords than just the auction - creativity in forming the ad, landing page, keyword list (yes get innovative, target tail etc) matters.<p>But when you mention of success stories I would assume there are 3 main aspects to measure your spend against:<p><pre><code>    1. direct revenue: actual money\n\n    2. quality of users: conversions, usage stat, repeat users/loyalty\n\n    3. scale: traffic volumes\n</code></pre>\nMost startups when they launch do it for #3 traffic, mid way focus #2 tune conversions, if they are still signed up #1 happens.<p>It is hard to represent or measure #2 and #3 in monetary terms. Yet every campaign value should be weighed taking into account of usage and traffic generated along with direct revenue. If you can figure out your formula - and see if adwords cost is less than value generated - it is a success. Good thing with adwords is it is a knob, once the wheel is set to operate at positive levels its easy to scale in terms of volumes by increasing spend.<p>In terms of when to start doing PPC I would suggest work backwards look at your conversion rates -<p><pre><code>    lets say for a random set of y number of users 2% sign up and generate x amount of revenue. So effectively you are fine spending x * 2 amount to get this set of y users.\n\n    Cost of acquisition = y/x with given conv rate.\n</code></pre>\nIf you can set up your adwords campaign to get a click at this rate it is promising. Of course there are complexities as conv rate would be different (mostly better) with adwords campaign than organic users. Revenue generate x is tough to measure with indirect revenue aspects - loyalty, usage, traffic etc and has to be dealt individually.",1227242128

The JRuby team have done some tricks to speed  up startup time, seems to respond almost as fast as MRI to me now.  Haven't paid attention to memory though, but if you are launching a script big enough that memory is a factor I don't think the JVM is going to matter.<p>With invoke dynamic around the corner (Java 7), it seems that JRuby is Ruby's best hope for a decent runtime.<p>What I don't get is why all there is such a strong anti-java sentiment in the ruby community.  Everyone wants to speed things up by writing native C code.  I for one would much rather write java code than C code.   It's just as fast and much less shitty.

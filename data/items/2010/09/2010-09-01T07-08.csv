1652173,comment,1649499,1651919,0,0,narrator,,,"Sometimes you can find concurrency bugs by reading logs during concurrent execution, along with a lot of sanity checks that throw exceptions when things go wrong.  You can also just look really hard at the code and simulate in your head what might go wrong.<p>IMHO, the hardest bugs are the ones where you have too much data and/or running through the test case takes a very long amount of time.  Usually the best way to chip away at these is to try and speed up the test phase by mocking things or to just do a good old stare at the code until the bug shows up.  It's a cut once, measure twice approach except with time.  You can either run the test again, or you can stare at the code for twice as long and not have the run the test multiple times.",1283327967

If he says something I disagree with, I'll happily engage in a discussion until we've laid out all our facts and ideas and found an optimal path. Provided a reasonable argument, PG will readily take your word. If you can't provide a reasonable argument to contradict PG, well, that's a good sign that you at least need to think about the problem some more.<p>I co-founded a games studio. Paul doesn't have experience in the games space. The ""worst"" outcome of a meeting with PG has been that he's given me an important new perspective, even if he isn't able to come up with specific prescriptive advice. His ideas and perspectives are hugely valuable. Not once has he stepped on our toes.<p>The key here is that startups receive tons of conflicting advice from all angles and discovering how to process this advice is crucial. Paul trusts that founders can decide for themselves whether his advice is, at face-value, good.",1283327795

You want the pain minimizing steps?<p>Dear Collector:<p>I am writing you regarding account number #12345, in response to your letter bearing $SOME_IDENTIFYING_INFORMATION.<p>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act says that you are not to contact any consumer who gives you written notice that they are inconvenienced by your contact.  This letter constitutes your official notice under the FDCPA.  You are statutorily permitted exactly one additional communication, delivered via the postal mail, indicating that you have received this instruction.<p>For your information, I have returned to $NATION.  It is not economically feasible to resolve our differences via the legal process at present, but I will contact you again in a few months to discuss disposition of this matter.<p>Regards,<p>You<p><i>a few months pass</i><p>Dear Creditor:<p>I am writing you regarding debt #12345, continuing our discussion of $DATE.  As you recall, I invoked the FDCPA protection against inconvenient contact, and you have since honored your legal obligations to not contact me.<p>I am prepared to extend you an offer to resolve this matter.  As of your last letter, you indicated that I owed $5,400.00 and that you were going to charge interest and legal fees in addition.  I am prepared to offer you $5,400.00, delivered immediately, in full satisfaction of this debt.<p>This is the best resolution your client will receive, and it avoids a costly legal battle which will be complicated by the international issues in this case.  I urge you to accept it.<p>You have my permission to contact me once, via the postal mail, of your final disposition of this matter.  If you accept, your acceptance should be in writing and include the language ""We accept your offer of $5,400 in full satisfaction of all debts between $YOU and $CLIENT.""  I will send you a cashier's check via courier immediately, and that will conclude our dealings together.<p>If you do not accept, please note that the FDCPA prohibition against contacting me outside the above exemption still applies.<p>Regards,<p>---<p>You'll note that they have an option not discussed, which is to sue you.  They will probably not do this, because suing someone outside the country very quickly becomes a six figure proposition even for the most trivial of matters.<p>As a foreign visitor, you may not be aware of how debt collection in the United States operates.  Many Americans are similarly unaware.  While they talk like bulldogs, their hands are <i>very</i> tied by consumer protection legislation, and short of suing you there is very vanishingly little they can do without your consent (well, report you to credit agencies).  They have no channel to the American immigration authorities and if they intimate that they do, they just violated federal law in a very serious fashion.<p>My expertise on the laws regarding consumer finance and debt collection is not that of a lawyer (and owes itself to a funny story about the difficulty of disambiguating names in a database), this is not legal advice, yadda yadda.",1283325763

Sure, the sunk costs are the same (actually writing the book), but the costs to produce, distribute and store the book are significantly less, so I'd expect a discount of a few dollars.  And yes, also because I'm foregoing the ability to lend it out or resell it.  Oh, also the technology is still pretty new, so I still don't think you're getting the same experience as with a copy of one of Knuth's books, or another well-made hardback.",1283324700

Had a baby and as a result of that got hit with a lot of health bills - that I am still paying although I went back to my home country.<p>I got promised a job when I graduated, but due to the recession - it didn't work out too well. I was able to work remotely, but that has since fallen through.<p>I had a car while I was up there and was making my payments consistently for a while - but after I moved and ran out of cash and income, I have decided to not pay it right now (mainly because I have to put my kid through school, etc.).<p>Now I am being notified by a debt collection attorney, and I have 35 days to reply in writing otherwise I will be liable for not just the outstanding debt, the interest and possibly the attorney fees of the company.<p>I no longer live in the US, and if I wanted to I could just walk away from it - but I believe in honoring my obligations (I have been doing that for my credit cards and hospital bills still outstanding).<p>What do I do? Do I contact the debt collection agency or do I get an attorney? I am kinda strapped for cash right now, so can't afford an attorney.<p>Once I get my cash and income situation taken care of, in the next few months, I would definitely be willing to settle it - but I don't want to just ignore it and then get hit with a big bill in a few years - or possible immigration issues.<p>I would prefer not to burn my bridges, and would like to go back to the US (if I need to) without having to look over my shoulder. So I would really like to get this taken care of.<p>Thoughts?",1283324503

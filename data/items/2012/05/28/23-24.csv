I use Filemaker for my actual, offline catalog. Every now and then I look for a solution that would let me get rid of the Filemaker db and just be able to do it all on a server, but most image galleries are geared toward photography - which usually entails more focus on the numbers than presentation, and the metadata fields are not easily customizable. As a painter, I need something that doesn't visually intrude on the image, ideally would automate thumbnail creation, be flash-free, possibly have a zoom feature. Suggestions appreciated.",1338249517

My gripes are tiny, things like in variation 13, I'd love to hear a little more leading through the phrase with the pedal, but honestly, that would probably break something else in the phrasing. I'm a violinist, not a pianist, so I don't know the Goldberg inside and out the way I do the Sonatas and Partitas.<p>However, I'm confused why Gould came up at all, since his recordings of Bach are lousy. His tempos are often so bizarrely fast or slow that the music is lost (particularly in the two and three part inventions). His voicing ranges from pedestrian to wrong. As for his messing with tuning and his piano, he was largely an eccentric crank who pretended that no one else was doing that, had been doing that, and was doing a better job than him. Look at the Goldberg recordings on harpsichord by Wanda Landowska (my favorite) and Anthony Newman for much, much better renditions than Gould.

So if a UAV shows up, and you're holding a .45 caliber handgun, we still have to presume you are innocent of the shooting (you may have picked up the gun from the street for example). However, if you take aim at a UAV streaming video back to base and start shooting at it, well that can and will be used against you in a court of law.<p>There is another issue which is that a hand gun is a poor weapon for shooting down an aerial vehicle. A good marksman, or someone very lucky might do it, but the weapon of choice would be a shotgun. Shot guns on the other hand are not effective at range so in a street fight they aren't a good weapon (great for close quarters, poor for engaging at range).<p>So in a completely lawless sort of situation I could see teams of shotgun toting folks keeping the UAV population down but not in the typical urban setting in the US.",1338247915

First of all, I'm not saying sysadmins are going away in any respect, but I do believe that with increased efficiency there will be fewer admins needed for any given business.<p>I currently support over 150 production systems on Amazon, so your estimation of 10 servers per sysadmin is outdated and inaccurate. Even by Instagram's own admission they manage hundreds of systems with only 5 sysadmins. By your calculation, Instagram would have needed at least double that.",1338246075

I don't want autoplay anywhere, but I really would not expect opening a web page on my phone to start blaring random audio out the speakers. I wouldn't call that ""sabotage"", I'd call that ""someone actually cares about what users expect"". (That's leaving alone data concerns, especially with limited and expensive 3G data plans.)",1338246004

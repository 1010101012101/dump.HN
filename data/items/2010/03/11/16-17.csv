It appears to me that the vast majority of men are literally looking to marry a supermodel, beyond that very little beside if she'll laugh at his jokes and be nice appears to matter.<p>Women on the other hand appear to have all manner of weird neuroses about what constitutes ""Mr Right."", so vast is the span of options it is not possible to really outline them all, they even conflict in many cases ""Works hard, financially secure, can take the kids to soccer practice and let me focus on my career"".<p>At any rate, I don't understand why from a man's perspective marrying a woman from abroad isn't the obvious option.

1184199,comment,1183828,1183951,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I partially disagree. The point of the PhD process is not to create knowledgeable, creative, courageous scientists. As you point out, they can (and do) come to be that type of person on their own.<p>The value of the PhD is to teach the budding scientist the <i>process</i> that surrounds modern science. It's an opportunity to learn what the social structures in the field are (societies and conferences), to meet fellow scientists and form a network of people to draw on for ideas and criticism, and to learn the vagaries of funding and formally writing up research. Having a PhD says ""I know how to do all these things... I know who the important people in my field are... I know which conferences are the most important... I know how to get funding"". All of these things are important things to know if you want to do science professionally, because you need the connections and the funding to put food on the table.<p>This isn't to say the PhD is some magical permission to do science. Lots of great science is done by amateurs, and more power to them. So scientists don't need a PhD to do science, but it is more than just a credential. It's a valuable training program on how to navigate all the social and bureaucratic things that surround the actual science.",1268326385

Claiming that gay marriage will lead to polygamy or bestiality is inflammatory. It's like saying that being religious is a dangerous choice because everyone knows it leads you to kill unbelievers.<p>Redefinition depends on how far you want to go to deconstruct the term ""spouse"".

1184114,comment,1183800,1183800,0,0,ccc3,,,"The only reason I can think of to make an interface that mimics a physical object is that the new interface is more likely to be instantly recognizable and intuitive to a user looking at it for the first time. In this case you're designing the interface to work best for a new user, which generally means it won't work as well for an advanced user. I would guess that designers of basic calculator apps, like the example in the post, are designing for the new or occasional user and assume that anyone doing lots of calculations will move on to something more efficient.<p>The problem with extending physical mimicry to more complex software is that the interface ends up adopting design compromises made for the physical world. I remember the idea of a ""virtual shopping mall"" where you would virtually walk through the mall, look around and pick a store to go into. But a shopping mall has to be a certain size because it has to hold a certain amount of stuff. It takes time to walk from one end of a mall to the other, but there's no reason to extend that compromise (made to gain physical space) should ever be made in software. For anything beyond a very simple application you're better off asking the user to learn a few things about how the software works and designing the interface for its medium.",1268325075

Taking some criticism is probably a good idea -- it can be helpful. Similarly passing blame even when the problem is your fault is probably a bad idea.<p>Say, for instance, you are on a project with a couple other developers. Your main responsibilities have been features a, b, and c. Further you noticed d and e were pretty messed up, and helped a junior developer start straightening them out.  Some milestone is reached, and you have a code review with the senior dev (who is one of those arrogant guys who may be pretty good, but is also a condescending asshat).

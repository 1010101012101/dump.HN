Also, they&#x27;re not trying to build a MVP and iterate. They&#x27;re trying to build Rome in a few years.<p>When you think about the hurdles these projects face, of course they fail.

Subsequently, Nutt and a number of his colleagues who had subsequently resigned from the ACMD founded the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs.[13]<p>Here are the citations:\n[12] Nutt, D.; King, L. A.; Saulsbury, W.; Blakemore, C. (2007). &quot;Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse&quot;.

These were respected scientsists originally picked for their qualifications & integrity. Their opinion was unpopular with the existing power-structures and so their leader felt he had to resign, and several of his peers followed voluntarily.<p>Up to this point, most governments have exhibited intent to ignore the suggestions and testable claims of researchers in this area, and to ignore the will of the people they represent.

Giving tax breaks to get such tend to pay back in that you get support businesses cropping up to support the original beneficiary.<p>That&#x27;s not really the issue. The issue is that these were tax deals done behind closed doors between government and businesses rather than the government creating a tax policy for all that is transparent and applied uniformly and fairly to all businesses, they created a tax policy for all except a handful of companies that could get private deals.<p>And that usually leads to bad results after a while. Yes it makes sense to have tax policy that treats different businesses differently. And it makes sense for there to be some flexibility and to be able to negotiate on certain things in a transparent and fair manner (e.g. a business &#x27;negotiating&#x27; over whether it applies for a sustainable energy tax benefit if it invests in a new green energy tech that happened to fall outside of the parameters of the sustainable energy programme the government created a few years ago when said tech didn&#x27;t exist, there&#x27;s some flexibility there to expand the programme for that particular company that makes sense. Such a negotiation fits with the aim of the tax programme, is transparent and will affect everyone equally who applies for it afterwards).<p>But simply negotiating some special tax rate just for you that doesn&#x27;t apply to anyone else, in a backroom deal that isn&#x27;t officially known to anyone else, that&#x27;s shady and corrupt, the kind of practices you expect from poor countries struggling with institutional development.<p>How you actually spend the money (e.g. to improve the area affected) is another topic altogether.

At first look, using functional programming it looks like you&#x27;re sacrificing the performance that you gain from mutations -- which to some extent is true. But when you look deeper, you&#x27;ll find that the data structures for functional programming languages have been adapted to work in a very performant way with functional programming patterns.<p>In the same way, when you look closer at the virtual DOM model, you&#x27;ll find that you can optimize the usage very well. For example, when you use React with immutable data structures (e.g., Immutable JS), deep equality comparisons can be done very quickly to reduce renders to the minimum subtree required, and to issue the renders for a given change in a batch operation.<p>With React, you often end up with even faster code than using manual DOM manipulations. Of course, your performance will vary depending on how you implement your code. Depending on which model you&#x27;re using, and how you program, you may end up with a faster or slower product with either methodology.<p>But at the end of the day, the performance gain from running code using state mutations just doesn&#x27;t seem worth the effort of having a significantly harder time reasoning about the code, and having to deal with the challenges of scaling a project where the complexity grows much faster with each line of logic.<p>And my feeling is that due to the time invested in managing a more complex project that deals with mutations, the &quot;performance per engineering hour&quot; gained for projects using a virtual DOM is more favorable for many projects.",1445429590

We define these conditions as Fair Open Access.<p>> Should Elsevier not accept our conditions, we will be forced to set up a new linguistics journal elsewhere.<p>Now it looks like Elsevier is not going to cooperate, so there&#x27;s hoping that linguists will now show solidarity and refuse to take on editorial roles with Elsevier [2].

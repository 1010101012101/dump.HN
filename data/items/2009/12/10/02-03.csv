This just sets everyone up for legal issues and hurt feelings later -- when you tell somebody an idea they may have already been working on it -- you then end up in a prior art mess.<p>NDAs are not something you should ever put into the CRM workflow for your sales people as a measured objective, i.e. I've seen quotas of, ""Get 20 leads to sign an NDA, get 10 POCs, get 5 sales.""  If you can't tell me about the features of your product without an NDA I'm not going to understand the product after I sign it.<p>NDAs make sense if you have an established relationship and you're working on something pre-patent or trade secret work together.  NDAs also make sense if you're hiring a consultant to come in and help with marketing, business planning, etc.",1260413928

If someone is downrating your comments, it's not me.<p>""If we already had clean energy, hypothetically.. would you be willing to take on all of the risks of global warming in order to be 2% richer? Honest answer.""\nNo, of course not.  None of my posts indicate a dislike for clean renewable energy.  I am an enthusiast of electric cars, passionate about ocean pollution, believer in locally based sustainability.  It would be my ideal to have a self sufficient home with no fossil fuels providing energy.  Hopefully I'll see that in my lifetime.<p>However, I stop at correlation=causation, I distrust any non-testable computer models intensely (be they of the economic or climatic type) I'm also dubious about the 2% - it's also based on computer modelling and government forecasts, none of which I place the slightest faith in.<p>The scientists are asking for peoples money - that's the whole point.  Directly through more research grants and funding.  Indirectly by asking for wealth transfers from people.<p>""if you don't have an alternative model that makes more sense, you don't have a dissenting opinion. You're just getting sucked into the politics of the situation.""<p>I completely reject that statement.  I don't have to have an alternative view on any theory.  Any theory on anything is completely rejectable without coming up with an alternative.  It's perfectly logical to say ""I don't have a better explanation, but you've failed to convince me"".",1260413844

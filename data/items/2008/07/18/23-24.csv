250344,story,,,4,3,JulianMontez,"Ask HC: What do you think about Java being taught in high school?",,"Hello Hacker News, I'm a high school student and have been taking Computer Science for two years. A lot of my classmates in the first year had a hard time understanding the concepts that the language carries. In between lessons, I would show them some Python and Ruby (other languages I was looking into). I was wondering what you all felt about Java still being taught as a first programming language.<p>As for me, I learned a lot of the concepts quicker and got more things done in Python than in Java. Why can't schools change the curriculum? I feel that doing this would make the classes easier and keep more people interested in programming.",1216425395

(And your life is supposed to suck, given your situation.)<p>1) You picked software development, the right career choice for you.<p>2) You've programmed at home for years, which is also right.<p>3) You entered college.  Very important and correct thing to do.<p>4) You left college.  Very correct thing to do, given that you had to pay lots of money but could not secure a loan in time.<p>5) You've tried to get work in a field you enjoy and are comfortable with.  Very correct thing to do.<p>6) You quit your work.  Very good thing to do given you were not treated like an adult, and underpaid.  Very important to recognize this.<p>7) You started another job, that pays you even less, but you were right to assert yourself and look for another job since the other had everything going against you.<p>You need to realize that it's not the lack of a degree that's hurting you, but your age.  If you were five to ten years older, you would be taken more seriously, as well has have better references--degree or not.<p>In the mean time, you may as well finish a C.S. degree at the most affordable college you can find.  You were right to investigate a community college, but I would recommend just attending a four year school because it might avoid transfer credit issues; however, since it's July, find and enroll in a  community college program that:<p>1) grants an Associate of Science degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Engineering;<p>2) has a charter with a four-year public school you might like, that has guaranteed admissions and full transfer of credits to a C.S. program at that college, allowing you to enter as a Junior.<p>The only thing you are doing wrong is whining (you were correct in this case, but I wouldn't do it from now on.  I would also not walk around thinking you've got the best plan for you, ever, being a software developer and possibly working for a high-tech company in four years, either.)  Just enjoy the experience.  Also, try creating applications for others to use while you're in college.<p>There, you're all set!  (The reason I don't recommend whining further is because sh*t happens to everyone.  And especially it being two years ago, don't stress over it, and don't even bring it up...  You started college, had financial aid screw ups, then continued college--a pretty normal occurrence.)<p>However, DON'T LOSE THE PASSION.  I can sense a lot of ""if I only had a chance"" energy and that (in my opinion) is the best energy one can have towards making something great.",1216424101

As the followup comment from the author indicates, his primary goal is to find someone to build his million dollar idea in exchange for shared equity. There's nothing wrong with that, but do him and yourself a favor. Respond only if you are interested in assisting with his million dollar idea or if you know someone who's a good lead for him to follow up with.

If an employee complains excessively about his old/current company during an interview then he's likely to complain about his new company too.<p>In the three times I specifically remember the interviewee dragging his old company through the mud, they ended up being a ""bad apple"" within six months of working with us. If they're not tactful enough to sum up any old employer problems with a wry, witty passing reference, then you should be worried about how they'll act when they run into differences with the rest of your team.",1216423704

250320,comment,249688,249688,0,0,jmatt,,,"Here are some of my personal opinions on the topic...<p>I completely agree shorter commutes create happier workers. I also think employees are less likely to leave a job if they live close, happy or not... And of course, for most people, commutes are a waste of time, and thus to be avoided whenever possible. But, when it comes down to it sometimes there is no way to avoid commuting (family, a great job opportunity, $$$$, inbetween homes, etc).<p>I prefer living in the city. I don't understand why most people prefer a ""McMansion"" as it's been referred to. To me it makes more sense to live in the city and have a cabin/condo to get away on the weekends and holidays. Then again I don't have any kids (yet). And it seems that the McMansion neighborhoods seem to have better school districts, family oriented communities and are safer. So I understand living in a McMansion for those reasons. What I don't understand are the single or kid-less couples who still insist on the commute and the McMansion. Maybe it is partially a societal difference. I don't see my residence as an especially good investment, and that may differ from most people.",1216423169

For the most part, it won't even be that hard. Don't waste time obfuscating it..<p>If it's at all possible, time would be better spent redesigning the infrastructure such that the client never has any data that you don't want the user to have.. The best way to do this is to generalize an API that the backend uses to talk to the front end. Then, modify your client to use this.<p>We do this with Chron X- We have a generic Card game API that we call from our Client.. It's not perfect, but we're actively making design decisions assuming that someday, other clients may connect, with or without our consent and blessing. We may never allow it, but we have to work under the mindset that the hackers can do anything our Flex can.<p>I'd suggest writing a middleware layer, which takes in requests based on a sessionID, and then allows only certain commands to go through, and only certain data to come back. That way, you minimize your exposure.",1216422356

When people try to claim competence because they have a degree, the most common reaction is laughter.

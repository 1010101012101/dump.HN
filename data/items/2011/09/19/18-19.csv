If you have 40 seats in your restaurant that turn say, twice a night and a group of 4 doesn't show up, you've just lost a considerable portion of your night's revenue.<p>Restaurants are typically living off scraps (5% margins are common), so OpenTable punishing you for not showing up is in the best interest of the restaurants. If you at least cancel, the restaurant can call up people on their wait list and hope to fill the vacancy.<p>And really, how hard is it to get online and cancel your reservation?",1316458795

Very expensive gift for an 11yo though, in my opinion.<p>I'd more likely get an e-ink kindle, not just because I think the screen is better for reading, but because it's essentially limited to books.

They can use stuff outside of blackboard if they wish. Also though, they may not have the time or skill to set up their own online course tools.<p>There are alternatives that many faculty are embracing such as wikis (wikispaces, etc.), blogs (wordpress), and even some universities are exploring more decentralized or cloud-based alternatives that don't box you into a walled garden, like wordpress hosting, drupal tools (harvard's openscholar), google apps, and see what BYU is creating (although I'm not sensing that it will be open sourced): <a href=""http://learningsuite.byu.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learningsuite.byu.edu/</a> (described in the educause article below)<p>The newest LMS tools like Instructure (and the newest version of Blackboard) are basically trying to emulate Facebook, for better and for worse, with dynamic streams of information and connections to social networking tools.

3014741,comment,3012214,3012485,5,0,lsc,,,"That is an interesting perspective, but it runs directly counter to my experience.  I've experimented with many different business models;  building hardware and selling it (and then renting co-location)   charging a setup fee that covered the parts costs (and then charging a just above cost fee for running the server)  and traditional renting.<p>Renting hardware, for me, has been vastly more profitable than any other option.<p>I can build a 32GiB ram server with an 8 core opteron, 4 'enterprise sata' disks, etc... for well under fifteen hundred bucks.   I could probably sell it for two grand, if I spent a lot of effort on sales.<p>Alternately, I can rent the thing for $300/month.  Heck I can rent a three year old server with similar specs for $300/month.   This is without really trying;  I thought I was going to have to part out those old servers, but people keep emailing me asking for high-ram dedicated servers.  I'm honest about the age of the hardware, and yet I still have more demand for old servers than I have old servers.  (I'm working on moving my xen customers on to new servers, so I will have more old servers shortly.)   Those old servers cost maybe $60/month for me to host; the new ones?  $30/month.<p>As far as I can tell, you can charge vastly higher prices if you rent your product rather than sell it.<p>From my perspective, renting is more profitable than selling even if I'm paying credit card rates on the capital.<p>I self-finance by offering people a discount if they pay 3, 6, or 12 months ahead;  5% for 3 months, 10% for 6 and 20% for 12 months.  It works quite well, new signups on a server will pay for the hardware the first month.   20% is kind of costly capital, but it still makes more sense for me to borrow and rent than to sell.",1316457930

Are we trying on clothes for a fashion show or are we trying to solve problems? Why in the hell do we need a new version of Mac OS, Windows, Linux, ...? Wouldn't the old version have gotten it done 1000000 times faster? Solving problems does not and should not involve new and shiny. We should all focus on: (1) our differences: we are not the same and we change- we should do work in a way that best utilizes our potential productivity- psychology/neurology should play into planning teams and projects, (2) better data collection and reporting: we should all be analyzing metrics about development and the services and products we provide, with A/B testing, feedback loop, etc. (3) Solving problems together: we need to limit forking to small R&D groups that do A/B testing and present their findings back to the core group, imo.

I guarantee it will make\nyou feel better, if you haven't read it.<p>One of the great problems we have as people, especially smart people who did well in school, is that we expect success to be the result of cleverness.  We put faith in _a crafty plan that is bound to work_.  This is not wise.  And, since the people you meet in elevators believe the same thing, they will be asking you for _the stupid thing that made it fail_.  But I know, and by the time you finish reading these books you will as well, that the thing you did wrong may have been nothing.<p>This is not what one generally tells people that fail.  And, goodness knows, many more things fail because people did something wrong than 'you were just unfortunate'.  So in general, analysing your failures in an extremely self-critical way, in order to learn from your mistakes is a beneficial activity.  What you aren't told, alas, is that sometimes the answer is _nothing_.  And beating yourself over the head for not being able to find out what you did wrong is not helpful if there is nothing there to \nfind.<p>I am in no way competing in your area, and have a bit of a problem understanding what ""social advertising ecosystem trending toward openness"" actually means, but for my money\nif you want to shut people up about your failure, there is\nnothing surer than saying we needed XXX amount of revenue\nby quarter Y, we only had YYY, and we couldn't get another round of financing because the market continued to be uncertain.  Techies, who generally want a technical fix,\ntend to shut up at this point.  Of course if your problem is that it is the financial people who want to rip open your wounds and comment on what is inside, then your pitch may be the cat's meow. :-)  Whatever works.<p>And you have to get up again, and start the whole damn thing\nover.  Which you may have to force yourself to these days,\nbut I promise you is worth it.  But, after reading these\nbooks, and learning all about hindsight bias -- there is one\nquestion I would leave you with.

Because your post did not make it clear.<p>Make-it-or-Break-its are often a good strategy, because if you are going to fail, you want to do so quickly so you can get up and do something else as soon as it is clear that this is not it.  But it's not the strategy for something you put your heart and soul into.<p>And something in your writing made it clear to me that you are hurting right now.  Been there.  Done that.

Now that it's a separate non-integrated service, it's an easier decision for me. I wonder is this is part of the plan though? If you can't add non-streaming content to the streaming queue in the first place you're not constantly being reminded of what's missing or how little is available to stream.<p>Every conversation of late about Netflix streaming seems to focus on the lack or pending lack of content when the Starz deal expires. A streaming service that didn't make lack of streaming content front and center to the user experience would seem to have a better chance of succeeding, especially for new users that quickly try and build up a queue only to find that particular item they now browsing isn't available to stream. Once you separate out the everything's availability of a huge DVD catalog, perhaps user won't miss what's not there quite as much.<p>I also wonder if those users that care about DVDs primarily care about having access to more than just recent movies and content that will never stream via Netflix (HBO shows?) and that perhaps the future of streaming is more about more recent movies and TV shows. However, if Netflix streaming doesn't progress to the point where it has a catalog breadth like the current DVD catalog, I worry what that means for those who enjoy having access to all of that long-tail content, especially now that local DVD stores with large catalogs are pretty much non-existent.",1316456546

Getting my students to get their own logins to some other site, take a quiz, scrape that data automatically somehow to some kind of password protected  database and get them to sign in to <i>that</i> and then check there)<p>Everyone gushes over the Kahn Academy approach of expecting perfection and permitting failure; they're right and I can run with it in Blackboard.<p>What I do:\nWrite random question pools using Blackboards obnoxious question writing web interface.<p>Randomly generate quizzes from a series of different pools by subject.<p>Let my students take the quiz as many times as they want; offer <i>zero</i> partial credit<p>Blackboard automatically puts the latest grade into grade center (which is almost always the highest since they stop taking it when they're satisfied with their grade) which they can then access with their university login at any time without revealing confidential information about other students<p>There is a terrible, ridiculous, hackery way to dump to question log files into excel, clean up the data (takes about an hour) and get feedback on how often each question in each pool is answered correctly, so I know which subjects the students are struggling with. We go over those topics in later lectures.<p>This has had a huge effect in my sections because it feels like the students work twice as hard but are half as stressed about it. They can fix just about any result for the better by <i>learning the material</i>.<p>So tl;dr I love learning content management systems and by implication Blackboard despite its many egregious flaws.<p>In terms of startup ideas, I think there's plenty of space to work with Blackboard rather than try to replace it i.e. I don't think their proprietary quiz formats would be difficult to decipher at all, which means a clever startup could make a ""We make making Blackboard quizzes easy!"" product and do big enterprise sales with it. Universities love to feel they are on the cutting edge of ""technology"" and clearly have deep pockets for this stuff (if you didn't click on the expensive link in the article you should)",1316456511

3014597,comment,3014039,3014275,13,0,nathanmarz,,,"You generally feed a Storm topology with a queueing system at the source. For example, we use Kestrel to feed Storm topologies. There's a setting called ""TOPOLOGY_MAX_SPOUT_PENDING"" which controls how many tuples can be pending on any given spout task at a time. This is more than sufficient for controlling bursts of data. If things back up, they will queue on the queueing server (s). In the future (not for a few months, at least), Storm will have auto-scaling where it will automatically scale the topology to the data.<p>If a tuple fails to be processed, the tuple(s) that triggered that tuple are replayed from the spout. See <a href=""https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/wiki/Guaranteeing-message-processing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/wiki/Guaranteeing-messag...</a> for more info on that. In that sense, Storm is an at-least-once delivery system (but messages are sent more than once only in failure scenarios). It is up to you to architect your systems to handle this. The approach I take is to build systems using a hybrid of batch processing (Hadoop) and realtime processing (Storm). With batch processing, you can run idempotent functions even with duplication, which lets you correct what's happening at the realtime layer. In that sense, Hadoop and Storm are extremely complementary. Here are some slides from a presentation I gave about this technique: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/nathanmarz/the-secrets-of-building-realtime-big-data-systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/nathanmarz/the-secrets-of-building...</a><p>Fields grouping uses consistent hashing underneath. So if you redeploy with more parallelism, it scales naturally and easily.<p>If a supervisor dies, it starts back up like nothing happened. Most notably, nothing happens to the worker processes. All state is kept either in disk or in Zookeeper. All daemons in Storm are fail-fast, and the Supervisor uses kill -9's to kill workers, so that makes things extremely robust.<p>I hope that answered your questions!",1316456220

So the applicability of the constraint is small.<p>And, I think all the constraint tells you is, don't suggest titles that are available on streaming for someone's DVD queue.  I think affirmative suggestions are much more interesting.<p>To me, your idea that people's streaming preferences are ""virtually identical"" to their DVD preferences seems like you didn't mean it seriously.  Hyperbole?<p>My own streaming habits are totally different from my DVD habits, not only due to limited availability of streaming titles, but also due to ingrained expectations.  It's kind of like TV versus movies.",1316455663

Opposing the minimum wage doesn't mean you hate the poor; opposing anti-discrimination laws doesn't mean you're racist; opposing generous maternity leave doesn't mean you're sexist.    Incentives matter, and often---probably much more often than not---the most straightforward and intuitively appealing solutions introduce incentives pointing in exactly the opposite direction.<p>Economic law is almost as immutable as physical law: trying to fix poverty using a minimum wage is like building a bridge using the wrong tensile strength for steel.  Intent is irrelevant, because you can't fool nature.",1201387890

104759,comment,104727,104727,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I'd consider hiring people right out of highschool.  I'm thinking of the kids who are obsessed about college admissions and are in that very intense competition to make into Harvard or MIT or what have you.  From what I've seen, the kids who make it to these plaaces worked harder in high school than in college, and they work pretty hard in college.  It's like, once they get in, they feel like they made it already.<p>A kid without a college degree is pretty undervalued nowadays, IMO.",1201386836
104758,comment,104733,104750,0,0,bmaier,,,"Yes I would say its really important.  If a person has the potential to earn money from a card submission they also have the incentive to start gaming the system (groups of people even) by rating their card highly even though it may not be the best card.<p>Also you really need to limit the voting by ip address, what prevents me from adding an affiliate link and then creating accounts with my 50 different email addresses and boosting that card to the top all for my personal gain...",1201386720

104750,comment,104733,104736,0,0,henryw,,,"thanks for the input. currently, i'm allowing users to use affiliate link only as an incentive for them to add more cards. i want to make sure all the details that they add are objective and no spamming occurs. in order to rate cards, you have to be registered, and can only rate once per card. i'll add a captcha to the registration to make sure no fake accounts are made.<p>do you think it's really important to not allow affiliate links?",1201385891

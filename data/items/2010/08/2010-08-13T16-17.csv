1601436,comment,1600521,1601027,0,0,whopa,,,"In my ten year career, I haven't found there to be a correlation between having a degree and being a good developer. I've worked with a number of awesome people, most with degrees, some without, and plenty of bad people, most with degrees, some without. To me, a degree isn't a positive nor a negative signal for anything. You can talk about value of the intangibles outside the education component, but in my experience, a degree doesn't necessarily confer this either.<p>EDIT: Actually, thinking about it further, I haven't come across many bad developers without a degree. This is surely selection bias: bad devs with a degree can hide in the bowels of BigCo with HR departments who don't actually know how to hire good people, but absolutely require a degree. The bad devs without a degree can't get these cushy, hard to be fired from positions, and therefore don't last very long and probably find another line of work.",1281718583

Having undiagnosed ADHD was a major cause of job difficulties in the past, as well as making poor choices (working short-term contracts in the late 90s, for example).<p>I have worked (via contract) for some nice names - Microsoft, Texas Instruments. I have a wide range of experience in tech support / helpdesk, web design, web applications.<p>I'm slowly increasing my programming skills, but I am self-taught. I speak PHP and Python.<p>I'm not amazing at web design - although my various clients have all been happy. But I don't have the skills to make those Photoshop templates I see. On the other hand, I think I do a pretty good backend... so I've been trying to focus on that.<p>I'm a computer generalist - I think I fit well in situations like I just found myself in: For example, the company wanted to take photographs of all their products. I'm not an expert photographer, but I knew enough to get the camera to get good results - and they were ecstatic with the results.<p>But right now, I'm looking at being out of work again - thank goodness my wife works. I can't afford college when I'm unemployed; and with my resume, companies looking for experienced developers overlook me - and companies looking for entry-level tend to want a degree.<p>If you were in my shoes - what would you look for?

Thus, the Java language as such is no longer a trap.""</i><p>This case is among few high-profile instances in which the GPL may not be free enough -- that is, Oracle may have a strong claim despite Sun's licensing of much of the JVM and JDK under the GPL, because the provisions of the license only extend to VMs which fully implement the Java spec. The license grant for the Java specification explicitly does <i>not</i> apply to VMs implementing a sub- or super-set.<p>See the patent grant released in Dec 2006 [1] – specifically the portion where it's stated that the implementor must ""not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space,"" and that the VM must ""[pass] the Technology Compatibility Kit."" Under this interpretation, Google's App Engine platform might also be considered non-compliant, depending on the underlying VM.<p>While I personally choose to release code under BSD or MIT-style licenses to avoid the GPL's viral restrictions, it is interesting to consider cases where liberal licensing alone is not enough to ensure the liberty of a platform.<p>[1] <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/jdk-6u21-doc-license.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/jdk-6u21-doc-license.txt</a>",1281718283

Meaning if you have $100,000 dollars in the bank, they need to have $10,000 in cash on hand. Of course, the 10% is all assets, not just yours, so 100 customers have a total of 1 million dollars, the bank needs $100,000 on hand for withdrawals.<p>That is just a broad overview that I remember from college. The numbers probably are wrong (10% is a nice round number) and I don't know how that works with a bank with 1000's of branches across the country.

It literally looks like a piece of paper morphs into new page when change page.  It is really out of this world.<p>Anyway, there are many reasons why the Kindle is more like reading a real book besides the display that looks identical to a piece of printed paper.  First of all, neither books nor the Kindle have a backlight which does, in fact, make the Kindle more simliar to a book than an iPad despite its lack of pages... You can read a Kindle on the beach or on a deck in the brightest sunlight you can imagine and the screen will just look better.  The same goes for a real book.  Just try that with iPad with a backlight and you will see a difference there.<p>Also, due to the lack of backlight the Kindle is much better suited for reading before sleep just like a real book.  The backlight of a computer monitor is the reason computer people struggle with falling asleep. A good fiction paper back is the best sleeping pill in the world and you just can't get that effect with a backlight screen.<p>Finally, just look the article we are commenting on.  Do you not notice how similar the Kindle character is to the newspaper, magazine, and book characters at 400x?  I would dare sare it is sharper.",1281718197

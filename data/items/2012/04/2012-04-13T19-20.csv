It immediately grabs me, peaks my curiosity, and makes me excited that I'm about to see a new product that doesn't exist yet.<p>But the image could use something to convey this is an audio product.  Something more clear than an angled shot of a music app.  Maybe some headphones next to the comp, or subtly work some music notes into the header somewhere. Just spitballin, but it would be nice if the header communicated music a little more clearly",1334347198

We chose to back MongoDB with EBS because that was the only reasonable way to get base backups (via snapshots) of the database. Although 10gen recommends using replica sets for backup, we also wanted a way to durably backup our database since there was so much important data in it (user accounts, billing, and so on).<p>On the other hand, we run PostgreSQL straight on top of a RAID of ephemeral drives, which has had good throughput compared to EBS so far. The reason we're able to do this is because PostgreSQL provides a mechanism for doing base backups safely without having to snapshot the disk[1]. Therefore, we just do an S3 base backup of our entire data (which uploads at 65 MB/s from within EC2) fairly infrequently, while doing WAL shipping very frequently.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/backup-online.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/backup-online.html</a>",1334346750

The more programmers can help each other to spend more time writing things that are great, the better off we all are.<p>The GPL fights proprietary software, but for things that are not products on their own, but are designed to be a component of or integrated into other products, it can also fight other programmers as well.

You had a situation, where an attorney told you that you had no remedy at law for some privacy breach, and you've turned that into ""any new law that eliminates privacy protections doesn't do anything because I already don't have any privacy"".  I don't think that was a good life lesson to have learned.<p>ECPA says service providers can access data ""as may be necessarily incident to the rendition of the service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service;"".  This is an narrow exception intended to make it legal for a sysadmin, doing legitimate work, to tail a mail queue or something like that.<p>CISPA grabs that exception with both hands and does a goatse.cx on it.  I think there's a big big difference between allowing providers access to data necessary for providing the service, and eliminating ALL civil and criminal liability for giving your data to, well, just about anyone, for just about any reason.<p>Again, CISPA is intended to legalize the wholesale sharing of your online activities FROM Google/Facebook/Verizon/etc. TO the MPAA/RIAA/Media Defender/government/etc., based on any tangible connection to the integrity of any online service (spamming? too many comments on HN?

Meanwhile, I was two hours into a client call negotiating turning functionality requests into deadline shifts, was simultaneously trying to triage a production issue to see if it was our problem or the client's problem, and had 50+ emails from developers and clients just from that day still un-responded to..  yeah, silent evidence is a bitch.<p>I do have to agree, however, that moving back to development released a lot of stress for me.  It's far less stressful thinking about whether or not I can get something done as opposed to wondering whether 15 other people are going to be able to get something done..",1334346552

It's likely worth is 0 and even in the case of a small acquisition, the amount you earn doesn't change your life in a big way (I was an employee in a founding team of a startup that was acqui-hired by Google) - you can earn similar amounts in a more straight-forward way as a hardworking consultant. All the other positive acquisition outcomes are such outliers that it doesn't make sense to estimate their likelihood.<p>That said, you can learn a lot about running a startup by joining one, and it's a good chance to build a good network of people. Raising angel money, getting advisors etc. will be easier if you already are known in your local startup scene.<p>Also, although I encourage people to start their own companies, it's much harder than you think.

A job is just another kind of mutually agreed relationship and you have the power to change its parameters or end it. But I guess some kind of Stockholm syndrome starts developing and some people need to be reminded that. Not only that, but their skill is in high demand so the is little to no risk in switching -- something that also needs to be said out loud. It's basically a form of self-help which isn't bad but should be labeled as such.<p>The assumption that only large consumer-facing products are worth working on is wrong. There is a whole world out there you don't know about and it doesn't run software on iPhones. It depends on the person, but you shouldn't need external confirmation to be proud of your work -- either you did it well or you didn't.<p>Generally, the problem isn't the project per-se, it's just the management. A horrible boss, ie. a horrible person will wreck your day regardless of what are you working on. If you are hired to write internal reporting software, don't be surprised you will work on internal reporting software. Make the most of it!<p>Software is depressing because that's the best you can do sometimes. There is this type of corporate developer that's just at the edge towards a good developer but he just believes he's the greatest. He'll always be unhappy because the Man just won't let him try the latest fad and if he only would be allowed he would make such great software. But what does he do? Crappy software! A certain degree of <i>modesty</i> is required in software because not everybody before you was an idiot, and if you had free reign you would make an even crappier solution with the latest fad and all.<p>But essentially, the kind of people feeling bad are just unmotivated because the job is not a good fit. That's it! As the RSA video said, they need more autonomy or a ""higher"" purpose or just want to get better at something else (mastery).

Evolution gave them all they need to thrive and be successful. Intelligence is, in evolutionary terms, very expensive, hi-maintenance and often counter-productive. So is individuality. These things are not the natural end-product of an evolutionary process like they are assumed to be. In fact, its normally the exception rather than the rule. Simplicity (seldom complexity, except for a short while and in niche settings) is the end result of a perfected organism in harmony with its environment.<p>You get what you need for the time frame in which you need it. After that, as soon as you don't need it so much, it will go. Like flight in birds. Dodo's didn't need it, lost it rapidly and then humans arrived. We killed them, tried to eat them and our technology (ships) brought vermin predators (rats and cats) to their world which they had no defence against -- and that was the end of them. Our `intelligence' didn't pan out too well for them. And they're just one example of this sort of thing. Its happening all the time.<p>When you are sitting in the shattered and burned-out remains of your world (literally or metaphorically), intelligence looks overrated. The same will eventually, inevitably, happen to us. An AI, or our own avaricious greed and ambition, will probably finish us all off.<p>Big brains, language and tool-making abilities are <i>not</i> necessarily the best or inevitable end outcomes in evolutionary processes. They happen because they need to. Then again, sometimes they don't, and that can pan out OK as well. When it does happen it also tends toward the self-limiting, as well.

by reading all the bad things seems that OrientDB would fit better than MongoDB for them:<p>- Non-counting B-Trees: OrientDB uses MVRB-Tree that has the counter. size() requires 0ns<p>- Poor Memory Management: OrientDB uses MMAP too but with many settings to optimize it usage<p>- Uncompressed field names: the same as OrientDB<p>- Global write lock: this kills your concurrency! OrientDB handles read/write locks at segment level so it's really multi-thread under the hood<p>- Safe off by default: the same as OrientDB (turn on synch to stay safe or use good HW/multiple servers)<p>- Offline table compaction: OrientDB compacts at each update/delete so the underlying segments are always well defragmented<p>- Secondaries do not keep hot data in RAM: totally different because OrientDB is multi-master<p>Furthermore you have Transactions, SQL and support for Graphs.

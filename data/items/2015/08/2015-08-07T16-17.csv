And while some of them are interesting, there are a few who are suggested by people who don&#x27;t really have any experience in language design, so usually we have to say no to a lot of features.<p>When someone knows what they&#x27;re on about, it&#x27;s probably the architecture of our project that doesn&#x27;t allow us to implement a specific feature; or would make it incredibly difficult to do so. And when you&#x27;re dealing with even larger projects like Nginx or something, you have to work on it to know if something would work in terms of the project, which is tricky unless you&#x27;ve worked on it extensively.<p>We&#x27;ve even had a guy who said we shouldn&#x27;t use LLVM because it&#x27;s slow (it&#x27;s not), and he didn&#x27;t like it. What I&#x27;m getting at with this point is that some people suggest ideas that a) change the entire course of the project, or b) are kind of silly and subjective.<p>TL;DR It&#x27;s complicated",1438966689

The language is really simple to learn and is generally easy to learn for speakers of the major language groups (Germanic, romance...etc). We waste millions of dollars on translators. Think of the UN where they have to translate complex ideas in real-time. There are numerous articles on how errors are frequently made. Think of the Soviet Union &quot;we will bury&quot; you really meaning we will outlast you. This also keeps us from infringing on other culture&#x27;s local languages.

10023520,comment,10022691,10022691,0,0,mindcrime,,,"The thing is, it&#x27;s not always about an &quot;unsolved problem&quot; per-se.  I think looking for &quot;unsolved problems&quot;, in a manner of speaking, is an overly simplistic idea.  The question is more &quot;where are the places where the introduction of some technological solution could (make some process more efficient | help somebody make quicker/better decisions | improve quality | reduce costs | drive revenue | etc).  In most cases, firms have <i>some</i> kind of solution to their problems, they may just not have the <i>best</i> solution.<p>I guess you could also say that this is arguing semantics, but they may also have places where things could be better using some new technology, but they don&#x27;t think of it as a problem, since they don&#x27;t know the technology exists, and therefore don&#x27;t even think in terms of applying it to their &quot;problem&quot;.<p>Also, as somebody else mentioned, people tend to &quot;normalize pain&quot; over time, to the point that something can be painful but yet if you ask them &quot;tell me about your pain points so I can help you&quot;, they don&#x27;t even think of $WHATEVER (because it&#x27;s become &quot;normalized pain&quot;).<p>My point is, it&#x27;s hard to just ask around for &quot;unsolved problems&quot; and find good stuff, even if you called up people in various companies and asked them flat out.   And that&#x27;s simply because they may not know what to tell you.<p>I think the best way to really identify areas for improvement is to have a deep knowledge of how a particular company (or at least, companies in a given industry in general operate) and identify the problems spots based on your own knowledge.  That, of course, is difficult for domains that you don&#x27;t know much about.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think there are any easy answers to this.  Probably the best answer I can offer is to say, build relationships with people in a given company / industry, spend as much time talking to them as you can, and bounce ideas back and forth until something seems to resonate.   IF you can find a company that has &quot;business process analysts&quot; on staff, some of those people may be able to help you, since they spend all their time looking at business processes and trying to find ways to improve them.",1438966592

There was a situation in which I needed a template class to be implemented such that I wanted only certain types to be accepted one way and others a different way.<p>I implemented a stream buffer that can accept different types into the stream.  Based on the type, the buffer would serialize and expand to accept the data.<p>To put this more succintly, an insert of unit8_t type would put a single byte into the stream buffer and an insert of uint16_t would put two bytes into the stream buffer.  And I needed a way to make sure the types were plain old data types (int, char, uint8_t, uint16_t, uint_32_t, etc...)<p>Here is sample code:<p>template<typename T>
class TStream
{
private:<p><pre><code>    typedef TBuffer<T> stream_buffer;
    stream_buffer mStream;
</code></pre>
public:<p><pre><code>    TStream();
    TStream(const TStream &rhs);
    TStream::~TStream();

    unsigned int Size() const;
    unsigned int ByteStreamLength() const;
    void     Clear();

  // some methods omitted for brevity

    const T&operator[](unsigned int idx);
    const T*operator[](unsigned int idx) const;

    TStream<T> &operator=(const TStream &rhs);
    TStream<T> &operator=(T const);
    TStream<T> &operator=(unsigned char);
    TStream<T> &operator=(bool);
    TStream<T> &operator=(double);

  // rest omitted for brevity</code></pre>
};<p>Doing this<p>TStream<unsigned char> ByteStream<p>causes ambiguity with<p>operator=(unsigned char).<p>I basically want operator=(unsigned char) to be omitted if T = unsigned char.<p>The way I solved this, without Concepts of course, was to use CRTP like so:<p>template<typename D, typename T, typename U><p>struct implement_operator_plus_equals 
{
  implement_operator_plus_equals() 
  {
    static_assert(std::is_base_of<implement_operator_plus_equals, D>::value, &quot;CRTP failure&quot; );
  }
  D* self() { return static_cast<D<i>>(this); }
  D const</i> self() const { return static_cast<D const<i>>(this); }<p><pre><code>  typedef D Self;

  Self& operator+=( U u ) {
    static_assert( (sizeof(U)%sizeof(T)) == 0, &quot;Non integer number of Ts in a U&quot; );
    T* b = reinterpret_cast<T*>(&u);
    T* e = b + sizeof(U)/sizeof(T);
    for (T* it = b; it != e; ++it) {
      self()->consume(*it);
    return *self();
  }</code></pre>
};
template<typename D, typename T>
struct implement_operator_plus_equals<D,T,T> {
  implement_operator_plus_equals() {
    static_assert(
      std::is_base_of<implement_operator_plus_equals, D>::value, &quot;CRTP failure&quot;
    );
    // Have an operator+= that cannot be called, so using ...::operator+= is legal,
    // but mostly harmless:
    class block_call {};
    void operator+=( block_call ) {}
  }
};<p>I believe I could have solved this without CRTP using Concepts.  Although my understanding is that Concepts follows a methodology of deny all, allow what is defined and there appears to be no way to allow all, deny what is specified as a Concept.  In other words, Concepts only tell the compiler what is allowed and there appears to be no way to specify what is NOT allowed without some further &quot;trickery.&quot;",1438966392

Modified slightly:<p>I think an interesting direction is figuring out how to leverage web tech (or just code in general) to interact with the real world. Consider companies like Uber and AirBNB. They&#x27;ve identified a real-world problem and set out to solve it using technology. A lot of the cutting edge stuff these days is figuring out how to take a real-world problem (genetics, taxis, mail), and writing some code to make it accessible, cheap, and easy to do.<p>IMO to find interesting projects, a better idea is to look backward: what industries are still in the 20th century, and how can you help bring them into the 21st with modern technological advancements?<p>What about farmers, truck drivers, construction workers? Why are they still driving tractors, trucks and bulldozers? Why aren&#x27;t robots doing those things more widely?<p>What about real estate agents and their legalese? Why are real estate agents still handing me stacks of paperwork? Can&#x27;t you Zenefits the crap out of that process?<p>What about community outreach programs and community centers? Why are community outreach programs still accosting me on the street and handing out fliers? Can&#x27;t they do outreach digitally? Can&#x27;t we automate scheduling basketball games and pick-up kickball games?<p>What about having to fill out paper applications or stand in line at the DMV? (Shouldn&#x27;t all that crap be automated by now?)<p>What about having to actually hand your credit card to the cashier at the drive-thru at McDonald&#x27;s? (Can&#x27;t they just magically detect who I am somehow and charge me accordingly? Why do I have to hand some punk ass kid my card or cash?)<p>What about planning weddings or raising kids?

Haven&#x27;t enough people had kids that we should have some solid data about what works and doesn&#x27;t work?)

Assume women will more favorably choose a mate the farther they are above some arbitrary standard (reasonable, though at the extreme end we see falloff--&quot;I don&#x27;t deserve him, he&#x27;d never date me, etc.&quot;--sames as we do in the other direction). Assume that these standards are the result of exposure to local norms (an example: as a friend returned from Kazakhstan explained to me, &quot;A good Kazakh man is one who doesn&#x27;t beat his wife after bedding down with a whore&quot;). Assume that mass broadcast and the internet have redefined what local is (reasonable).<p>It follows then that standards are being influenced by members outside of the physical local community of women (for an example of similar issues, consider the body image research done with Barbies and other deconstructions of beauty).<p>That being the case, it seems perfectly reasonable that these same standards can be raised above local market rates.<p><i>Ah, the &#x27;nice guy&#x27; argument.</i><p>Well, no, not really--the observation is that, at a time where there was a large supply of men looking for traditional arrangements, they held out, and now with the advent of technology, that supply has decreased because of the substitute good of hookups enabled by Tinder et al.<p>There&#x27;s no point in being mad, for example, that carriages are hard to come by if you didn&#x27;t buy until cars were widespread.<p>I&#x27;m a bit bitter because it all seems like such a waste: some of us were disappointed before, some of them are being disappointed now, and the sum total of unhappiness in the system (taken through time) has increased unnecessarily. It&#x27;s just unfortunate, and could&#x27;ve been avoided.<p><i>It disturbs me that you refer to women as &#x27;they&#x27; as if they all collectively decided to ignore you.</i><p>Don&#x27;t read too much into it...it&#x27;s just a useful and short pronoun in English to refer to women, saving a few characters.",1438966236

Consider companies like Uber and AirBNB. They&#x27;ve identified a real-world problem and set out to solve it using technology. A lot of the &quot;cutting edge&quot; stuff these days is figuring out how to take a real-world problem (genetics, taxis, mail), and writing some code to make it accessible, cheap, and easy to do.<p>The problem with &quot;cutting edge&quot; is that it&#x27;s often ahead of its time. It takes a LOT of time and effort to make even a tiny dent in the space of &quot;cutting edge.&quot; If that&#x27;s something you want to do, you might want to go back to academia and stay there. The &quot;real world&quot; is a bit more pragmatic -- there&#x27;s a reason the space shuttles tended to have tech from 20 years ago and not brand-new tech from last month.<p>IMO to find interesting projects, a better idea is to look backward: what industries are still in the 20th century, and how can you help bring them into the 21st with modern technological advancements?<p>What about farmers, truck drivers, construction workers? Why are they still driving tractors, trucks and bulldozers? Why aren&#x27;t robots doing those things more widely?<p>What about real estate agents and their legalese? Why are real estate agents still handing me stacks of paperwork? Can&#x27;t you Zenefits the crap out of that process?<p>What about community outreach programs and community centers? Why are community outreach programs still accosting me on the street and handing out fliers? Can&#x27;t they do outreach digitally? Can&#x27;t we automate scheduling basketball games and pick-up kickball games?<p>What about having to fill out paper applications or stand in line at the DMV? (Shouldn&#x27;t all that crap be automated by now?)<p>What about having to actually hand your credit card to the cashier at the drive-thru at McDonald&#x27;s? (Can&#x27;t they just magically detect who I am somehow and charge me accordingly? Why do I have to hand some punk ass kid my card or cash?)<p>What about planning weddings or raising kids? (Haven&#x27;t enough people gotten married that planning a wedding should be as simple as browsing Amazon for a few hours?  Haven&#x27;t enough people had kids that we should have some solid data about what works and doesn&#x27;t work?) (These two things aren&#x27;t really tech-related, but man, if you could figure those out...)<p>The best part about this approach is that pretty much <i>any</i> idea you come up with will be &quot;cutting edge&quot; as far as these areas are concerned.

I have a test sketch, it runs for 10 seconds and a transmitter send a string made by ID + LENGTH + 10byte string + CRC + ACKNOWLEDGE. The transmitter counts every correct and mistaken reception by the receiver:<p>What I mean with practical bandwidth is the byte sum of all the correct packets received that are useful (so the ID, LENGTH and ACKNOWLEDGE are not counted) / 10 (seconds of test) and so you get how many correct and useful bytes/s you can send in the fastest setup (for or while).
The absolute banwidth is the total byte count wihtout no exception.<p>You are right the difference is not enormous. 
fast_mode is quite near to the limits of delayMicroseconds(), micros(), function execution time. I left a standard_mode with a really solid behaviour to let people use PJON also with boards without an external oscillator (like using internal PPL clock to 16mhz on ATtiny) or equipped with ceramic resonator that is less precise in timing.",1438966200

The correct one is to statically link your native extension with your own copy of OpenSSL or include a dynamic (.so) copy of it in your APK. But some developers were retrieving the library from a random Android device to link against, but then relying on the OS to provide exactly those same symbols.<p>Even more painful is that native libraries that were pulled into your project by some <i>other</i> dependency can also cause the same issue.

You&#x27;re held without bail because it was a violent crime, and your presence in another state at the time of arrest marks you as a flight risk.

The technology does not exist yet to do so, which is why these things are still traded for money. This goal is unfortunately not relevant to commodity price movements on human time scales, and falling prices shouldn&#x27;t be interpreted as evidence of scarcity no longer existing. Commodity prices don&#x27;t fall because someone invented a great new way to get corn or oil without labor or fertilizer or land; they fall because of short-term supply and demand imbalances.<p>Upward prices does not only indicate supply scarcity. It might indicate supply scarcity, or it might indicate increased demand. There are two sides to the market, and either can move the price. Prices are not &quot;driven&quot; upwards by some teleological entity that just wants higher prices; the action of people buying and selling finds a consensus equilibrium based on supply and demand.<p>If one commodity price is going up, it might be the case that there&#x27;s a supply shortage. If all are going up, it indicates broad based demand due to a healthy economy that requires more inputs. Broad supply scarcity rarely if ever extends beyond a few specific commodities. Oil might be scarce, but <i>all</i> commodities being scarce almost never happens. Commodities are widely produced in many diverse locations all around the world by groups with widely different goals.<p>If the average price of <i>all</i> commodities is rising broadly, it&#x27;s demand-driven, not supply constraint. Barring events like a world war, there will never be a massive simultaneous supply shortage in oil, wheat, corn, soybeans, cattle, hogs, gold, silver, and frozen orange juice. A broad price rise is thus generally a good thing since it means lots of people have jobs producing things and are making money to buy things that require these inputs.",1438963255

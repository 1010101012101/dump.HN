8381419,comment,8380822,8381159,1,0,winter_blue,,,"Thank you for sharing this list of OS dev resources!<p>I would also recommend Andrew Tanenbaum&#x27;s &quot;<i>Modern Operating Systems</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</i>&quot; (the MINIX book), to anyone interested in OS dev. I read it when I was teenager (around 15), and I really <i>really</i> enjoyed it. Tanenbaums&#x27; books were one of the few truly addicting textbooks. As a side, &quot;<i>Structured Computer Organization</i>&quot; by Tanenbaum was also really great. It gives you a foundational understanding of how computers are architected that is indispensable if you&#x27;re going to be doing OS dev.",1411955960

All of the resistance just self-organized into multiple areas now. We are very very very upset with the government in Hong Kong right now. More and more people are joining the strike today. There&#x27;s reason to expect the situation will escalate peacefully, and hope will shine thru. Honestly, justice is on our side, this is the most civilized resistance I&#x27;ve personally participated. We even pick up our own trash after sit-ins!",1411955862

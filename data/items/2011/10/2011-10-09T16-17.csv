You know where he is, but he lives in a compound with 20 other people.  Drones are slow, use little fuel, and you can swap out the people flying them, so (depending on the model) a single drone can loiter over the guy's compound for up to 24 hours.  You watch him until there aren't any innocent people around, then you shoot a missile.<p>All this can be done with manned aircraft, it's just a bit more expensive because you have to refuel them every four to six hours and the pilot will eventually be too tired to continue.<p>The real change isn't automation, but rather the targeting pods that allow you to see what's happening on the ground from miles away at 10,000 feet and precision weapons (like laser-guided bombs and missiles) that allow you to hit exactly what you intend to hit.  Whether the aircraft is manned or not manned really doesn't change anything from the perspective of capability.  It just changes the cost.<p>None of this is a substitute for boots on the ground - the conflict in Afghanistan would have over years ago if we could put soldiers in Pakistan.

3090733,comment,3088739,3089858,3,0,bane,,,"It's a good question. Ideally, in a perfect world, your entire computer would be nothing but monstrously fast CPU registers.<p>But because building those (and the associated support architecture) are much more expensive than slower solutions, we've ended up with a stack of slower and cheaper memories to handle datasets that are too large for the register space, then too large for RAM, etc.<p>Right now data has to be moved up that stack of faster, but smaller, memories before it can be worked on (nonvolatile storage like a HD->volatile storage like RAM->CPU register) and then back down that stack to store the result (register->RAM->HD).<p>That movement has to happen across the system bus which on CPU bound operations is a word length for that system -- familiar numbers like 8-bits, 16-bits, 32-bits, 64-bits, etc. but for some older systems that work length might have been something oddball like 7-bits, or 36-bits or something. In other words, you don't move 2GB of data in one shot from your hard drive into RAM. You have to do it in chunks of ""words"" which means chunks of 32-bits or 64-bits at a time -- over and over again until you've moved the data into memory.<p>However, RAM is hideously slow compared to CPU registers. I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but lets say moving data from one part of RAM to another takes 160 cpu cycles (80 to read, 80 to write). This sounds impressively fast on a modern 3.6GHz computer, but that means you can only move 22.5 million ""words"" around.<p>By comparison, moving data from one register to another might take 1 cpu cycle.<p>Furthermore, you can't operate on data in RAM, you have to move it into a register anyways, do the operation, then move the result back out into RAM. So we might be restricted to slightly less than 22.5 million operations per second -- which is pathetically slow.<p>Clever compilers (and ASM coders) will try and keep things in register space as long as possible to avoid this and try and reach closer to 1 operation per CPU cycle. And modern CPUs have a number of enhancements that also help with this (pipelining, instruction optimization) etc.<p>But the most important bit are caches. Cache memory are designed to take fewer operations to store/retrieve data than RAM and transparently sandwich in between register space and RAM space and hold working sets of data too large to fit into register space, but are still being worked on so shouldn't end up in RAM space yet. For sake of argument, let's say it takes 20 cpu cycles to read/write from a Cache. If we're operating on data that can fit in a cache, then we can do 180 million instructions per second instead of 22.5. But again, if the working data is too big to fit into the cache, we get a cache miss and end up having to go back to RAM. But now we have to add 20 cpu cycles to a data round trip giving us 180 cycles to read that data and write it back out.<p>Because the speed difference between RAM and CPUs are so great, multi-level caches which are slightly larger, but use slightly more cycles to retrieve data than the main cache (L1), sit below the CPU cache stack. Even if it takes 30 cycles to read/write some data from an L2 cache (which would only happen on a cache miss in the L1 cache), 20+30 is still faster than 180 for RAM. And so son. Today we have L1, L2 and L3 caches which are all designed to keep the CPU from waiting on RAM.<p>In other words, all designed to try and overcome the delays of moving data across the system bus and into register space as introduced in the von Neuman architecture.<p>The system stack these days is something more like HD->RAM->L3->L2->L1->registers with the caveat that moving from one level of the stack to the other probably requires it to move across the system bus which again is likely 32-bits or 64-bits these days. That's <i>4 or 8 bytes</i> at a time.<p>With today's multi-gigabyte datasets, that's a ton of data moving across the bus, little of which will end up fitting into any number of caches, slowly eeking it's way into the register space so the CPU can do something like adding two number together. At 3+Ghz, the CPU is mostly just sitting around waiting on data to make it's way up or down this ridiculous stack that's all been designed to accommodate the von Neuman design.<p>If we had only one kind of memory, and it was fast, and the CPU could directly operate on any part of that memory like it was register space, <i>and</i> we could eliminate the difference between slow but large non-volatile memory (HD) and faster but smaller volatile memory (RAM) computers wouldn't do 180million instructions per second on a good day, they'd do closer to 3.6billion like they are capable of.",1318178310

This is a relatively recently recognized, milder form of a very deadly condition.  It has all the same issues, but they tend to be somewhat less severe.  It's still a very serious condition and I spent 3.5 months bedridden and a year at death's door, in part because I had to get pretty darn sick before doctors took me seriously.  I was just kind of low-grade sick all the time and doctors and everyone else treated me like a hypochondriac for most of my life.  Because it's genetic, they tested both my sons.  I told them which son had it before they ran the tests:  The one who was 'like me'.<p>While mostly bedridden and sleeping 18 to 20 hours a day, I was being routinely denied treatment while they referred me on to yet another specialist and more testing.  They were often unwilling to prescribe me anything because they didn't know what was going on.  So I ended up doing what I could for myself because I had no real choice:  I was being denied treatment and in serious danger of dying.  Then, after getting a diagnosis, rather than trying to get me well, doctors promptly informed me ""People like you don't get well.  Symptom management is the name of the game.""  I was kind of like ""Fuck that.  I survived using alternative treatments with NO diagnosis.  Surely we can do better than that now that we know what the problem is.  Yeeesh!""  So I intentionally turned something of a deaf ear to my doctors and the world and sought my own answers for a long time.  (People act like I am some whack job who is hostile towards doctors and refused to see them. Nope.  They largely refused to treat me.  Excuse me for being so gauche as to live anyway.)<p>I eventually figured out how to get myself (and my son) basically well.  Saying this on CF lists elicits two types of reactions: 1) I'm the second coming of jesus christ or 2) I'm a liar, a charlatan and a snake oil salesman.  There are more folks who are openly hostile than folks who are adoring fans.  Long experience has taught me that it's a very bad idea to engage the adoring fans.  It only inflames the haters more and convinces everyone this really is solely about my ego.  The fans also have a tendency to say things that are adoring but vacuous.  In other words, they basically fawn all over me but don't ask good questions about ""so, how exactly did you accomplish that?"" This is extremely dangerous, not just because it incites lynch mobs and provokes other people into attacking me all the more but because I don't want anyone doing anything on ""faith"" in me.  I want them to come to a better understanding of their condition and make more informed choices.  I don't want someone latching onto some detail of something I said and running with that, without context.  Some of the things people with CF have tried is pretty stupid and it shocks me what I have to explain because they are missing the background info.  So in order to help them, I need more info about what they don't understand and that means I need them to engage me in conversation, not just adore me and feel ""inspired"".  Making in roads into real conversation is a very hard row to hoe.<p>I think it would be a shame for what I have learned to not benefit others.  But I am also not interested in taking all kinds of abuse or trying to cram my help down the throats of people who are openly hostile and not receptive.  Since what I did is largely rooted in diet and lifestyle, unwillingness or disinterest is a show-stopper.  This doesn't work if it is not by choice and participatory.  I think the top-down medical model is part of the problem anyway.  In my experience, the top down approach amounts to ""you can't get there from here"" in terms of genuine wellness.  It simply doesn't work.<p>At some point, I concluded that one of the issues is that most people in the CF community simply can't wrap their brains around what I am talking about and one thing that would help would be a more information-dense delivery method than the written word currently on my website.  I think a simulation (aka ""game"") would be useful in that regard.  But for the moment, I have left most of the CF lists I was on due to the attacks (which often occurred with the backing of the moderators, who then treated me like a loon for suggesting the expectation of politeness and respect from other people which applied to everyone else should also apply to me) and have largely stopped updating the site (in part because I am just busy getting a life but also because the site has been used as a source of ammo by people who are openly hostile).<p>If I am unable to find a way around this impasse, I am willing to focus on other things and let this go.  I got myself well to get my life back, not to seek out new ways to be martyred.  I think it would be a shame if I cannot share what I have learned but I'm also not willing to put up with the level abuse that I've been subjected to and I can well imagine it escalating further into far more than mere name calling on some email list.  People with CF suffer quite a lot and people die from it, often at extremely young ages.  So emotion runs very high in the CF community.  I think some people are hostile in part because they have basically tortured their child to keep them alive and they can only live with it because they were told it was the only option.  Someone telling them ""there's another way and it's more humane"" is tantamount to calling them a child abuser.  Not my intent at all and I don't agree with that interpretation but I get the impression that's part of why I get so much hostility.  There are other reasons why I get such strong negative reactions but this is fairly long as is.<p>Thanks for asking.  It's a pleasure to discuss it with someone actually interested/curious.",1318177637

Wealthy and powerful people have been behaving badly behind closed doors since <i>at least</i> the Roman Empire, and probably before then as well. The problem is with us. Why don&#x27;t we hold them accountable for their misdeeds? Why do we buy into their rhetoric that they are the job creators? Why do we give equal time to their views that they are being persecuted like Jews during Kristallnacht, when the events of the last few years have show that, if anything the opposite is true?<p>I think articles like this, honestly, are a disservice. They&#x27;re comfortable. They&#x27;re easy. They put the blame on the wealthy -- &quot;Oh look, those billionaires and plutocrats are at it again!&quot; -- without asking the real question: what systemic changes can we work towards today to ensure that people like Vikram Pandit, Dick Fuld and Jimmy Cayne can&#x27;t wreak the same kind of havoc that they did in 2007? What can we do to ensure that people appreciate the impact that obscure financial regulations have on their everyday lives?",1392713878

You mention derisking - creating a proof of concept (a short sprint that proves you can do something you&#x27;re unsure about) is one way of eliminating risk. Agile however, includes no practices for identifying, analysing and managing risk. Similarly, absolute reliability requires upfront design, and documentation.

One cannot just ignore complexity and treat everything as black boxes and someone else problems. But so many do. This is the distinction.<p>You you got a motorcycle you better have to understand how it works and why important design decision has been made, based on what line of reasoning.

We&#x27;ve all seen exceptions, but by the time that meeting takes place, the employee has usually left already in their minds and counter offers are typically too little, too late.<p>If, as in your three cases, the employer has clearly failed, then the employee is in a position of strength. They probably don&#x27;t even want a counter offer, as they are already resolved to leave. If the employer is surprised, it simply further illustrates the problem and validates the decision to leave.<p>From the employer&#x27;s perspective, if the employee is just trying to leverage better comp opportunistically instead of through merit, it&#x27;s also unwise to match or beat the offer. In my experience, this only tends to happen with younger, inexperienced people who don&#x27;t have a long view of their career.<p>Either way, my policy is that when a person leaves, that meeting marks the end of their tenure at the company. Pay them for the two weeks notice they are always willing to give, just as if they were still working, and make all honorable accommodations. But once someone has resolved to leave, it&#x27;s just better for everyone if they weren&#x27;t around for an extended farewell tour.<p>This is often very difficult policy for managers, because they fear that a person is indispensable and will require the full notice period to train up replacements. They worry about the disruption to the business that it would cause. But if that&#x27;s the case, it simply highlights another management failure. I&#x27;d rather take the business disruption, which gives my team an opportunity to shine, instead of the cultural disruption of having someone there-but-not-there, anxious to move on.",1392712861

That library is enclosed in an &quot;actor&quot;, and it communicates with the other stages/threads via an application-specific message (not using data types from the library; you want the loose coupling).<p>If the library has non-reentrant code, then you can&#x27;t have more than one thread for the stage -- you can&#x27;t parallelize it.  But it generally won&#x27;t lead to correctness problems.<p>curl is actually a great example, because it has an event loop for parallelism (rather than threads).  So you would run a single thread for curl, because you wouldn&#x27;t want more than one thread anyway.<p>Say you are writing a web crawler.  From the network/curl stage, you just pass off pointers to blocks of memory to parsing threads.  Parsing threads will be CPU bound so you will likely want to run instances of that loop in multiple threads, and you will be able to do it with no problem, since they don&#x27;t depend on the curl library.  They just take in blocks of memory and output some data structure to another queue.<p>This is also a good way to compose say the curl event loop with event loops from other libraries (GUI libraries, perhaps).

For example, say you win a contract for $100,000, of what percentage should be paid to a subcontractor? Do you have to disclose how much the contract is worth and how much the subcontractor is getting paid? Would the subcontractor want to know how much he&#x27;s getting paid vs the contract, would this affect his incentive? How many projects would an average subcontractor (web programmer) take on, and is it possible for them to work on more than one project at a time?<p>Or should you hire one subcontractor for each new project and put him on it?<p>Before I did freelancing, at my last job position as an developer, our boss told us to make sure our hours are close to 40 hours a week because he got a contract for 1000 hours and that we don&#x27;t need to be pressured to rush through the project, is this cheating the client? Sometimes we would finish the work much faster (10 hours a week but bill for 40 hours), is the client getting ripped off? Should he be billed for less because we saved so much time?<p>When you are selling your development services, is it easier to sell when you have built a team of coders?<p>I actually really enjoyed getting prospects excited and explaining the technical details, and then asking for the sale.

The haskell version is deferring some of the work to when the object's actually used - but if you wanted to use that parser in a real program, you'd have to do that work. It's like those webserver benchmarks that you can do much better on by making the server print ""HTTP"" before it's done any processing.<p>This seems to be a common problem when benchmarking haskell. You absolutely have to use a program that outputs the real-world result you want, otherwise the clever compiler with its lazy semantics will optimize away all the work.",1346338650

But the submitted article, after all, was about treatment of human patients who have already been infected by the malaria parasite. For a top-level comment then to come in under that article that has nothing to do with internal medicine use of the advocated chemical is, at least, a sign of careless reading, and possibly a sign of greater tendentiousness.

4454922,comment,4454001,4454496,4,0,justinschuh,,,"Plugin management is actually a bit complicated, and in the case of Chrome we've had mulitple levels of it for years. The simplest is click-to-play, where the plugin is replaced with a graphic in the page that you can click to run it. This is the most convenient, but is vulnerable to click-jacking or other trickery. Then there's plugin blocking, which doesn't have the click-to-play weaknesses but is less convenient because you need to enable the plugin through a browser control (ie. infobar, page action, or context menu). Finally there's disabling, which just prevents the plugin from running at all.<p>For out-of-date and perennially vulnerable plugins (like Java) Chrome uses the second mode, which blocks the plugin unless the user accepts it through an infobar. It's not a perfect defense, but we've found it to be extremely effective at preventing exploits because the vast majority of the users don't let the potentially vulnerable plugin run. I'd really like to see this approach catch on more broadly, but other browser makers are understandably cautious about how they should handle plugins.",1346338534

The application will enable a student with a specific profile to find opportunities to volunteer at a school that needs his or her skills. For instance, a student who is proficient in French and have a couple of hours to kill can search my application's database and find a school that needs him or her right away.<p>The motivation for this is straightforward. The university I attend requires 60 hours of social work before graduating. Most students procrastinate on this and end up squashing all these 60 hours in one place where it is hard to quantify what they did. It is also rather unfortunate that most of these students, lacking a tool to find places to work at in the Atlas region (where the university is), end up doing social work in far less needy places in their hometowns. The schools in this region desperately need help.<p>I am think a stack of Rails and Backbone with cloud hosting. Student verification will be done through their emails, and expansion to other universities rests upon the condition that they offer emails to their students.<p>My current concerns are how to register schools and how to get them to provide feedback for the work students provided. The students are in a much better place to frequently check the service; the school teachers or managers, who most likely won't have access to Internet, don't. I was thinking of registering the schools rather manually, with optional online registering for those who can afford it. Any ideas on this and other remarks are most welcome.",1346337520

In Basic, a variable represents at the same time the data and its memory address, the two concepts are not separated. When you introduce pointers, you split that concept in two: address and data, and to complicate you say address is some form of data. In Basic, the variables are the memory. Each variable you manipulate is equivalent to a piece of memory you can store things in or get things out. With pointers, you loose that equivalence: memory becomes invisible through the code. I can have a memory block that exists in my memory that is no longer pointed by any variable. This means that you get a separation between the way memory is and the way the code looks like. What is difficult when learning pointers is to get that extra level of abstraction: you have to look at the code as an access route to the memory, not as the memory itself.",1346336964

Loops are not interesting on their own, but rather in terms of what you can do with them. So teaching them how to count (which is easy for children to grasp) is the proper beginning, followed by repetition (do something n times). They will learn loops, but only in terms of fulfilling a purpose. Things like functions come in later, as they are initially unnecessary. When they start to write the same lines of code over and over, you can point out the idea of reusing parts of code that get stuck in something called a function. Abstraction is thus quite easy to get them to understand (I speak only from experience, not a studied truth).<p>Basically, you teach them what they need in order to accomplish a specific task. Are arrays really useful to teach at first if they don't need serialized access to data? Better to wait until they need something like that. The goal is to give them problems that require those concepts and see if they ask for it. Initially, they might make 20 variables (where an array would do), and complain that it gets tiresome.

4454727,comment,4453500,4454564,3,0,arielweisberg,,,"Another Volt developer here.<p>Short answer, Volt establishes a global order across transactions. Transactions can't be executed immediately because their position in the global order isn't known when they initially arrive. The exchange of ordering information is driven by in-flight transactions. In the absence of sufficient in-flight transactions to drive the ordering process heartbeats are sent every 5 milliseconds resulting in increased latency and lower throughput as the system waits on heartbeats. 2-4x the concurrency should have shown different results.<p>We're finishing a different transaction initiation system that doesn't produce a global order so that people can do this kind of benchmark and get the expected result. You can switch the beta version on in 2.8.<p>I also wonder if they had clock skew. The global ordering process is always delayed by the amount of clock skew you have. With NTP properly configured this is 10s of microseconds, but with a typical out of the box NTP config it will be milliseconds unless you have a lot of uptime.<p>I don't really see this as an excuse and it is why we are eating the pain of a transaction initiation rewrite so people can use Volt the traditional way with small numbers of synchronous client threads.",1346336242

4454718,comment,4453500,4454564,2,0,jhugg,,,"There is an explanation for this. VoltDB latency is currently sub-millisecond for single-node deployments, but often several times higher for clusters. This is due to the current system of global-ordering-agreement that adds some latency. So for synchronous workloads, you'll see a big drop moving from one to two nodes. With enough parallelism, you will see close to double the throughput. Still, we usually look at scalability starting at 2-3 nodes, because a distributed system with one node is a different animal.<p>This is something we address in our docs, but people naively testing VoltDB run into it more than we'd like. So for the next major release, we've re-worked how we do global ordering and can now achieve sub-millisecond latency on larger clusters in internal testing. Note that there's no change to our serializable consistency to achieve lower latency. So this new scheme has a huge impact on synchronous workloads, but the scalability with enough parallelism has been close to linear all along.",1346336156

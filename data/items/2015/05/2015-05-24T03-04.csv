In the US you have a huge group who couldn&#x27;t afford med school but really want to save lives as a doctor. Under that system, they could do it.<p>That&#x27;s not entirely true.  The United States military is one example of an organization that will pay for your medical school in exchange for some of your time.  My wife is a physical therapist in the Army and this is how it worked for her.   The Army paid for her school and she earned a 1.5x service obligation for the time she spent in school.  It was a three-year school so once she finished, she owed 4.5 years of Active Duty service.   On top of the school cost itself, they paid her as an active duty officer while she was in school, plus they paid for our housing and subsistence allowance for our family.  All in all, she made about $75-80K a year to get her degree, then $100K+ once she was done with the school.  It&#x27;s not some front lines combat thing, either.  She works in a normal clinic like most PTs, treating Soldiers and civilian family members and retirees.   She&#x27;s in it for a career so she will receive a retirement pension after 20 years (how many civilian docs in the US get that?), plus lifetime healthcare for her and me and our children until they turn 18.<p>It&#x27;s truly an incredible deal for us, and it&#x27;s available to anyone with the grades to get into medical/dental/PT/OT/etc. school and who can pass a physical and fitness test.",1432437930

Housing is an issue to work around for sure.<p>Seattle - Yes (but also quite expense)<p>Austin - Yes to a less degree<p>Portland - Maybe.<p>All of these are great cities with plenty of dev jobs. You really need a strong CS program to build around if you want think about not moving to Silicon Valley. University of Washington totally fits that bill, as does University of Texas- Austin, but I would have to guess that Portland has a good local university (but I&#x27;m not familiar with it from afar like the others)",1432437114

Watson isn&#x27;t designed to be a single global AI system that will enslave us (well, at least not yet), rather it&#x27;s designed to be trained so it can go in depth on various topics to make humans smarter at their jobs - whether that&#x27;s medicine, finance, travel, cooking, or who knows what else.",1432437051

The anecdotal data around me shows that the people with food intolerance and I won&#x27;t eat X because someone in the newspaper misinterpreted a study have a even number of X chromosomes. To make sure there is balance - there is a lot of bronutrition in the opposite direction.<p>> I have yet to meet a person whose diet choices fall out of the range of rationality<p>Any person that observes religious restrictions - that is not rational. Also any person that refuses to eat X based on pseudo, improperly conducted or improperly understood science.<p>> I am vegan because I would rather not have had a sentient animal purposely killed for my meal - and it is a decision I came to after years of thought and consideration.<p>That will push you only to vegetarian.

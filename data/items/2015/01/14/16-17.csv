8887447,comment,8886041,8887409,0,0,fixermark,,,"&quot;Me&quot; in this context is the customer. I&#x27;m talking about pages I see in the wild; when pages can&#x27;t talk to their backends, they throw a &quot;We crashed; please refresh&quot; dialog, and I do what I&#x27;m told. ;)<p>Pages I write generally try their best to wrap calls that can fail in a reasonable retry envelope with some intelligent discernment of what response codes can be retried (429, the occasional 420 if someone thought Twitter was cute, the VERY occasional 500 if I just happen to know that the service in question is flaky) and only failing the error back to the user if the client can&#x27;t retry it. In contrast to the non-JavaScript forms-only sites I&#x27;ve used, which tend to just surface their 429s and 500s straight to the user and expect them to know what a &quot;back&quot; button is (and whether it&#x27;s safe to resend a form in this context), it&#x27;s a better user experience.<p>(Incidentally: I do find myself having to re-invent that &quot;retry envelope with a success handler, fail handler, and filter to determine if the response should be retried&quot; boilerplate over and over as I move among frameworks; if anyone&#x27;s built a smooth request wrapper for that, it&#x27;d be nice-to-have).",1421254745

It&#x27;s was a little disheartening to see an empty page loading and then making JSON calls and thinking that by then a server rendered page would have been already fully loaded.

If you have a million users looking at the same content, you can render the template once on the server or a million times on the clients. Obviously, that&#x27;s not always the case, but with things like ESI [1] the content does not have to be exactly the same to take advantage of caching (rendering the template once).<p>Also, keep in mind that content is compressed so the actual transfer time is often negligible, and the JS libraries could be bigger than the total html for the session.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Side_Includes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Side_Includes</a>",1421254658

8887440,comment,8886164,8887351,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"It&#x27;s somewhat less depressing than that, from a personal point of view, at least. Most interventions carry with them pretty significant risk. Therefore the choice is not between &quot;do nothing and see what happens, or do something with zero risk and see if it helps&quot;, but rather &quot;do nothing and see what happens, or do something really high risk and see if it does more harm than good.&quot;<p>Iatrogenic disease (harm caused by interventions) is by some measures the leading cause of death in the US, outstripping heart disease and standing at more than ten times the rate of death by automobile.<p>Under those circumstances, not doing anything until something horrible happens is not a bad policy, and the people engaged in it are not expressing cynical indifference so much as a due awareness of the real risks involved in almost any intervention.<p>Which is, admittedly, kind of depressing, but for quite different reasons.

8887438,comment,8886041,8887088,0,0,dpark,,,"> <i>The reality is that a lot of people (especially frontend people) don&#x27;t have the CS foundation to understand why and when the design patterns prevalent in Angular/Java are useful (or even what patterns exist to begin with).</i><p>That&#x27;s hardly fair.  Design patterns are not that difficult conceptually and in my (admittedly limited) experience Angular doesn&#x27;t really introduce anything new.  It&#x27;s not hard to pick up because devs are lacking foundational skills.  It&#x27;s hard to pick up because it&#x27;s overcomplex and difficult to adopt in pieces.  Despite claims that it&#x27;s easy to &quot;add as much or as little of AngularJS to an existing page as you like&quot;, there seem to be no examples of piecemeal adoption in the docs.  I&#x27;m sure someone with Angular experience could plug in a bit of Angular to an existing app, but someone just starting apparently has to choose to 1) go all in, 2) spend a lot of time learning Angular, or 3) use something else.  If many competent devs are &quot;hitting a brick wall face first&quot;, that seems to be indicative of problems with the framework.<p>Also, this is somewhat tangential, but I&#x27;m not sure software design patterns are part of computer science anyway.  They belong to software engineering, which is really not the same thing.",1421254612

8887436,comment,8885951,8886304,0,0,jccooper,,,"Dragon is &quot;berthed&quot; to the ISS, unlike Soyuz which is &quot;docked&quot;.<p>Berthing is what they do to ISS modules. It&#x27;s basically bolted on--which requires a fair bit of work from the crew on the station side, both mechanically and in getting the spacecraft in place (which they do by robotic arm capture). They do this for the cargo stuff because the berthing mechanism is wider, lighter, and cheaper.<p>Docking is what you do for a  manned spacecraft. They have fancy mechanisms to attach and detach quickly and mostly-automatically. It&#x27;s complex and the opening is enough to get people through, but it&#x27;s fast and easy. A docked spacecraft can leave on its own; a berthed one would require crew still on to help.<p>While cargo Dragon could take a person down to Earth, and they&#x27;d probably survive (probably nestled among bags of trash), it&#x27;s not going to do so in a hurry, and since you have a seat on a Soyuz already, and it&#x27;s designed for it, you might as well use that. Especially if you&#x27;re in a hurry. I think the only time cargo Dragon would be involved would be something catastrophic happening to one of the Soyuz--but not to anything else.",1421254604

I was a new-comer to the team when I became the remote lead, and one of the things I did was focus on getting folks to communicate electronically.

When you add all these compiler specific attributes and introduce a lot of preprocessor macros I think you are creating a situation where you&#x27;ve created code that is easier to write, but potentially harder to read as there is now a lot more abstraction that a programmer has to wade through (assuming they need to debug that abstraction and not just trust that it just works).

The low-skill labor it replaced was largely the large-scale manual labors of raising food, producing energy, and making basic everyday items.<p>The need for more educated, better trained, smarter workers during the Industrial Revolution led directly to the establishment of free, publicly funded schools for all through high school. That was a major cultural shift, a huge public investment, and a huge jump in the mental capabilities of the workforce as a whole.<p>I think it&#x27;s arguable that now we&#x27;re facing another similar shift, and we need to make another jump in how we educate people.

It&#x27;s easier and cheaper to keep these main engines ready for emergencies and let the docked craft perform altitude boosts.<p>As to the parent comment, burns are required because the ISS is at a <i>very</i> low altitude. It is still technically within our atmosphere and experiences significant drag from it. In addition, as the stations rotation changes, it&#x27;s corrected using gyroscopes on the station. Once these gyroscopes have stored their maximum momentum in the flywheels they need to be released, and thrusters are used at that point to cancel out the momentum.<p>Something a lot of people don&#x27;t seem to realize is that the station is moving all the time.

Word + track changes can get the job done for one-person-at-a-time as might be seen more often when making revisions.  (We haven&#x27;t compared word+revision control).  But the typical Word workflow involves emailing documents to collaborators - barf.<p>2) LaTeX+bibtex is better for references.  As far as I&#x27;ve been able to tell, EndNote is a steaming pile of pain that crashes frequently and takes Word for the Mac out with it.  And glitches in horrible ways.<p>3) Word users are more likely to get their table formatting the way they want it in less time.  I hate playing that game in LaTeX.

What sucked is like half the pile would be trash by that point and I missed dates for things etc.  She thought it was ironic because a number of my clients have given me compliments and sent me emails that say I am so organized and my code and project deliverables are so clean and well thought out. They just never saw my desk before.<p>She changed the workflow for me and has basically made me WAY better.  When I get stressed out I will tend to stack still sometimes, which tells me it isn&#x27;t yet 100% ingrained but I am working on it.

She also planned out our cleaning schedule.  So like my 16 year old does his laundry on Wednesdays, she does my daughters laundry on Thursdays, and ours on Friday.

See comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8887085"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8887085</a><p>I would say the upper bound on the amount of energy someone will spend on BTC is roughly the cost of (prestige of mounting a 51% attack) + (BTC market cap of one individual). If people allocate resources to BTC efficiently then one rogue person will just mount an attack and take over the network for the combination of prestige and fortune. Any person with large BTC wealth will want to have more security to protect his investment appropriately, and your security against said attacks is buying more hashing power. The fact that over time hardware becomes cheaper just means it&#x27;s a constant losing battle.<p>Other markets that allocate money to security I think can reach an efficient amount because the system they&#x27;re protecting does not, as a core part of it, require you to have more processing power than your user&#x27;s / people you transact with. The two security models are so drastically different I don&#x27;t think a comparison can be made. Perhaps the closest comparison is password hashing where it&#x27;s good practice to increase difficulty over time to slow down attacks, but with 2FA and lockouts after N attempts, you actually don&#x27;t need to allocate significant resources there.",1421252222

8887063,comment,8884837,8884837,0,0,bwindels,,,"I agree with the sentiment of the of the article. Dependencies should be isolated and not spread out all across your application. Even though both don&#x27;t have tight definition, I think it&#x27;s fair to say that a framework is usually larger in scope and API surface area than a library and usually impose a certain way of coding (and toolchain) on you. Isolating your dependencies (gui, persistence, ...) is a lot easier when you use a small library than using a framework that pretends to have all the answers.<p>It is true that you have to lay out more infrastructure yourself working this way but I feel that this is a really good thing because it makes you really think about the problem you are trying to solve, and don&#x27;t just think in terms of the patterns your framework offers (e.g. MVC: &quot;I have some logic, so I&#x27;ll put it into a controller!&quot;). This usually leads to code that is a lot easier to understand and is easier to test.

In the end, the law in this area is generally in the form of case law created by courts in response to novel situations. The courts have to make judgement calls. In my experience, LE agencies make a lot of effort to ensure their policies conform to existing caselaw and cover the gaps in it. Sometimes they get it wrong.

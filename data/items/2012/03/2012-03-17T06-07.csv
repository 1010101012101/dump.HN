For example, trucking, construction, even farming can be done by women, because of automation and advanced tools, that doesn't require much physical strength.<p>The more automation the higher chances of women to succeed.<p>However, automation itself is dominated by men. tech industry is an example.

3716549,comment,3707101,3707914,2,0,Gormo,,,"> I keep reading these sort of articles and wondering why the American people seem so opposed to basic employment law.<p>Because, for quite a few cultural and structural reasons - e.g. our strong culture of individualism, pluralistic civil society, and common-law as opposed to civil-law tradition - Americans are relatively skeptical of allowing a priori regulatory intervention into the immediate circumstances of their lives.<p>People here generally believe that they ought to be free to make their own arrangements without outside intervention, that law should only be used as a failsafe mechanism, and that legislation/regulation are only necessary where the existing constraints within civil society <i>and</i> case-by-case judicial process have not successfully averted a significant problem.<p>There are plenty of exceptions to this, of course, but what you call ""basic employment law"" is quite often regarded as an unjustified intrusion into people's private affairs.<p>> You all seem to agree that you work too long and don't get enough holiday.<p>Sounds like a case of ""the van is always at the corner"".

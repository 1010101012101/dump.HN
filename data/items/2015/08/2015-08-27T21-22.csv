10132420,comment,10131975,10132325,0,0,lucb1e,,,"I only know about the Netherlands, but European might be similar:<p>- When an organization collects data about you, they are forced to tell you about it (unless they&#x27;re police or something I guess) and tell you what they are going to do with it. In Dutch this is called the &quot;Informatieplicht persoonsgegevens&quot;.<p>- Upon reasonable request, an organization must give you all information they can reasonably give you. &quot;Reasonably&quot; means, given a normal amount of effort. If they need to contact the garbage collectors and dig up an old cassette they threw away years ago, that is unreasonable to ask. They may also charge a fee, but the limit is quite low I think.<p>- You can ask an organization to correct or remove your personally identifiable information if you have a good reason or if they have no reason not to. For example if you ask to remove your IP address from logs and they want to keep it for security purposes for 4 weeks, their argument sounds pretty reasonable (unless you have some better reason).<p>- They cannot keep personally identifiable information for longer than necessary. For example, log files from the web server may be kept for security purposes, but if you have ten year old log files, that is too long to be reasonable for that purpose and is thus illegal.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve always wondered about is how applicable this is to foreign organizations with websites accessible from the Netherlands. I&#x27;ve heard some people say that for companies with customers in the Netherlands, Dutch law applies and those customers have the above rights. Nobody seems to comply with that, though. Another thing I&#x27;ve heard is that if they have an office here, that office can be held to our laws. I should look that up some time.",1440712777

That kind of predeterminism is precisely a form of local hidden variable theory. Such a theory is disproved if we can prove the violation of a Bell inequality. The standard reference for understanding the connection is this laymans-terms paper by Mermin:<p><a href=""http://web.pdx.edu/~pmoeck/pdf/Mermin%20short.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.pdx.edu/~pmoeck/pdf/Mermin%20short.pdf</a><p>If we accept that this experiment is indeed a standard-loophole-free violation of Bell&#x27;s inequality, we then conclude that we must give up one of three things: locality, realism, or all free will. This rules out any local hidden-variable theory. The mainstream view is then to keep locality and free will. Some alternative theories (notably Bohmian ones) give up locality and keep realism, but this is strongly at odds with what we know from special relativity, and indeed locality is assumed in all work on quantum field theory (through Lorenz invariance) which has been verified to match experiments to a precision above that of any other physical theory. The third option, which essentially no-one supports, is that free will is impossible in our universe and that everything everywhere is predetermined.",1440712417

The attempt to deliver some statistics isn&#x27;t very helpful:<p><i>Is there any way to estimate the frequency of these episodes of violence committed by mentally ill person who were not being treated? There was then, and continues to be, no national database that tracks homicides committed by mentally ill persons. However, a small study published in 1988 provided a clue. In Contra Costa County, California, all 71 homicides committed between 1978 and 1980 were examined. Seven of the 71 homicides were found to have been done by individuals with schizophrenia, all of whom had been previously hospitalized at some point before the crime. The 10% rate was also consistent with the findings of another small study in Albany County, New York.

(I&#x27;m having trouble estimating this---the easily available figure is murder rate, but that&#x27;s not the same as probability of being a murderer) But let&#x27;s fudge this as being the murder rate of 4.7/100,000, which surely overshoots because some murderers kill multiple people [1]<p>P(Schizophrenic) = 15.2/100,000 [2]<p>Then we get P(CommitsHomicide|Schizophrenic) = 0.0986 * 0.000047 / 0.000152 = 0.0305<p>So very roughly three percent of people with schizophrenia would be expected to commit a murder. This is 649 times the probability of the average person being a murderer, which is quite a substantial difference.<p>However, in my opinion that increased likelihood of violence would not justify involuntary commitment in all but the most extreme cases. Otherwise we would essentially have to imprison tens of thousands of people for crimes that 97% of them are not going to commit. It&#x27;s like Minority Report&#x27;s &quot;pre-crime&quot;, but a horribly inaccurate version thereof.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intention...</a>

It&#x27;s becoming a point-fighting martial art in competition.<p>That&#x27;s fair. To be honest, the competition aspects of judo are what ultimately made me give it up. I respect that Jigoro Kano was trying to find a place in the world for these techniques, and that sport was one way to carve that space out, however I&#x27;m not in martial arts for competition.<p>Truth be told, I&#x27;m not really in martial arts for self defense either. The reality is, that there will always be someone with the capacity to bring greater violence to a situation than I can defend against. Even if I&#x27;m really great, there are always knives, guns, car bombs, and nukes that I&#x27;m probably not going to walk away unscathed from.<p>On a related tangent, my Danzan Ryu sensei had a self-defense illustration that has stuck with me. Just about the time we felt pretty good with our tanto (wooden knife) takeaways, she&#x27;d have us practice our knife fighting with sharpie markers. Lesson learned: even if you&#x27;re really good, you&#x27;re going to get cut, and it&#x27;s probably not going to be trivial injury. If someone flashes me a knife and asks for my wallet, my wallet is theirs. The only time I would consider a knife / gun takeaway would be if it was very clear that the person wielding said weapon was utterly intent on using it. I suppose if some random person were to try and beat me up on the street, my martial training would be somewhat useful in avoiding injury, but I&#x27;m most definitely not training for this scenario.<p>These days I train aikido, but do so for the fitness, the mental challenge, and the camaraderie of the dojo. Unlike judo or BJJ, I can imagine myself training into later life. That said, my first judo sensei was an old hippy who trained for many years in Korea and Japan and claims he never suffered anything worse than a sprained toe. So, maybe I&#x27;m just a nancy--a label I&#x27;m very happy to wear ;-)<p>> You can feel most joint locks, such as knee bars and arm bars, so it&#x27;s safe to know when it&#x27;s time to tap.<p>Arm bars, definitely. However, I&#x27;ve been told there is a significant percentage of the population that actually cannot properly feel a knee bar before the point of damage. When we trained them in DZR, we applied them <i>very</i> carefully, especially with people experiencing them the first time, in order to make sure we were dealing with someone who properly felt pain in advance of damage.<p>> Aikido does far more wrist locks. We don&#x27;t train them in BJJ very often because they aren&#x27;t very effective and are easy to get out of.<p>In terms of ground fighting, I&#x27;d reckon that&#x27;s definitely true. Aikido doesn&#x27;t do much of that, and so wrist bars are done more dynamically. My judo intuition about wrist bars makes me a very cautious aikidoka on these things. On the other hand, the vaulting throws from kote gaeshi sure are purdy! Like most things with aikido, I suspect it becomes reasonably &quot;effective&quot; after a decade or two of training.<p>> Most blood chokes, including arm and leg triangles, are easy to tap to and low risk. Sometimes someone may put on a choke that is a trachea choke, but the worst you have there is a sore throat. Neck cranks are also no-no&#x27;s for lower belts.<p>Yeah, I&#x27;d agree with that. Same as judo. Even a blood choke that results in unconsciousness isn&#x27;t crazy dangerous if the person isn&#x27;t also falling. Blood chokes shut the flow of oxygenated blood to the brain, and restore it instantly, so the risk of brain damage is low compared to wind chokes that deoxygenate the blood. There are similar rank restrictions in judo competition for chokes (and arm bars).",1440711853

10132295,comment,10130203,10131828,0,0,tzs,,,"> Besides the fact that measurement at that level is actually interaction, how can you prove that both particles were not having the same state from the start?<p>You can&#x27;t get the same results that you get with entanglement if there is some kind of internal &quot;agreement&quot; among the particles from the start. I think the clearest example of how that kind of thing cannot reproduce the results that you actually get with entanglement is a thing called the CHSH game.<p>The CHSH game goes like this.<p>You have two players, A and B. When the game starts, A and B are sent to separate locations, very far apart (say, a light-day apart), and the two locations will be at rest relative to each other (quantum is confusing enough...let&#x27;s keep relativity out of this!).<p>At each of those locations, there is a referee. The referee has a true random number generator, which he uses to generate 1000 random bits, one at a time. After each bit is generated, the referee tells the player the bit, and then the player selects a bit, 0 or 1.<p>Once the players have picked their bits, they are brought back to the original location, and they are scored. Scoring works thusly:<p>For i = 1 to 1000, the players get 1 point if and only if the AND of the referees i&#x27;th bits == the XOR of the player&#x27;s i&#x27;th bits. In other words, if the player&#x27;s bits matched, then the players get a point if either or both refs had 0. If the player&#x27;s bits do not match, they get a point only if both refs had 1.<p>Before the game starts, the players are allowed to work out a strategy for the game, and they are allowed to bring anything with them that they want.<p>Without using entanglement, the best strategy for the players is to agree to both pick 0 every time. They will get the point 75% of the time that way.<p>With entanglement, though, they can do better. They prepare 1000 entangled qubit pairs in the state (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2, and they each take one qubit from each pair with them when they are separated. They also agree on a common reference so that when they do measurements on their qubits they can orient their bases in a particular way as described below.<p>When player A is told the i&#x27;th bit, A takes the qubit from the i&#x27;th entangled pair, and if the ref&#x27;s bit was 0 measures this in the {|φ0(0)⟩ , |φ1(0)⟩}, and if the bit was 1, A measures in the {|φ0(π/4)⟩ , |φ1(π/4)⟩} basis. The result of this measurement is the bit the player chooses.<p>B does similar, except B uses the {|φ0(π/8)⟩ , |φ1(π/8)⟩} if the ref gives a 0, and the {|φ0(−π/8)⟩ , |φ1(−π/8)⟩} for a 1.<p>Here&#x27;s a diagram showing the angular relationships between these basis, in degrees:<p><pre><code>   B1                B0
   |                 |
   |        0        |        45
   +--------+--------+--------+ 
   -22.5    |       22.5      |
            |                 |
            A0                A1
</code></pre>
Notice that when either player sees a 0, then no matter what the other player sees, they are measuring their qubits using bases that are 22.5 degrees apart. When both players see 1, then they end up using bases that are 67.5 degrees apart.<p>The probability of their measurements agreeing is cos^2 of the angle between the bases. This terms out to be 85.4% of the time when either sees a 0 and so they use bases 22.5 degrees apart, and so they get the point 85.4% of the time in that case.<p>When both see a 1, and they use bases 67.5 degrees apart, the probability of agreeing is 14.6%, but since in the case of both seeing a 1 they want to disagree to get the point, they get the point 85.4% of the time in this case too.<p>So, overall, using their entangled qubits, they get the point 85.4% of the time, which is much better than the 75% of the time non-quantum approaches give.<p>If you replace the spooky entanglement with something where the qubits&#x27; state was determined at the start, the above does not work. You only win 75% of the time.<p>Obviously, no one has literally played the CHSH game as described above, but they have done equivalent experiments, and the result is a better score than you could get without the spooky entanglement.",1440711560

I do understand however how many people would be distrustful of his casual writing style.  He tends to sound like a lowly blogger, not like a respectable academic.

Start with the first few chapters of E.T. Jayne&#x27;s <i>Probability Theory: the Logic of Science</i>.  That&#x27;s more basic, less crazy sounding, and more generally applicable.<p>Now I don&#x27;t exactly know how physicists deal with quantum mechanics.  I asked one, and he didn&#x27;t even bother with any interpretation, sticking with the observable consequences of the equations (a more prudent attitude than either Copenhagen or Many-World).<p>Something however bothers me deeply: insisting on calling amplitudes &quot;probabilities&quot;, while they&#x27;re anything but.  That only makes teaching harder.  Seriously, I was tempted to mass delete every occurrences of &quot;probability&quot; from the &quot;Probability Amplitude&quot; article in the Wikipedia.<p>> <i>If I were to stipulate that the Copenhagen interpretation(s) is (are) silly philosophical daydreaming, could you do the same for many-worlds?</i><p>Err, it doesn&#x27;t work like that.  If I were to convince you, I would have learned nothing, and believe then what I believe now.  I can only give you my current best guess.<p>Which is, many-worlds is by no means certain.  At the very least we don&#x27;t have a Theory of Everything, and we could miss something.  Collapse postulates however are just crazy.  Rejecting the existence of the amplitude you didn&#x27;t observe is just as insane (no less, no more) as rejecting the existence of a photon which just passed the limits of our observable universe.<p>When we do find a theory of everything,  I bet the equations will predict the existence of things that can&#x27;t be observed —not even in theory.

A Copyright plaintiff actually has to prove that the defendant had access to the material and was inspired by it (or copied it).<p>BTW, substantial similarity acts as defacto evidence of copying in Copyright.  So, you might claim you didn&#x27;t copy Michael Jackson&#x27;s Thriller because you were on a desert island and never heard it, but if your rendition is really similar to the original, then that similarity is itself proof sufficient that you are lying.  Additional evidence isn&#x27;t necessary.<p>In software things could work differently.  I think one way the defense would be most aptly used is in cases like the notorious podcasting patent.  There you could see literally hundreds of independently written podcasting style applications, where literally every one of the engineers writing podcast software were willing to testify that they&#x27;d never seen the podcast patent or heard of the company that wrote the patent.  I think courts can take that as strong evidence of obviousness, as all of those engineers perjuring themselves is unlikely, and the simultaneous widespread invention of the same thing means its probably an inevitable and obvious advance.<p>I don&#x27;t want to go into too much detail about how I started my current patent work, because this account is anonymous.

Often, a reduction of fees by 25% would increase the bottom line by 25%.
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s at once the most remarkable and most precarious fact in this application. It sounds like you&#x27;ve discovered that in a typical metro area, nearly 50% of brick and mortar customer-facing businesses are food service, of which maybe 80% are single location, and that their margin is brutally low. You discovered this with loyalty cards too.<p>Isn&#x27;t that crazy? Main street is mostly one-location restaurants! And food service is effectively the lowest-but-positive margin business. It&#x27;s like the only thing you can&#x27;t make in China and ship is burritos.<p>There are so many startups chasing so many one-location restaurants. Loyalty cards, payments, jobs, delivery, backend business services like payroll and benefits, etc. Everybody else who&#x27;s even slightly higher margin scales radically and just does these tasks they&#x27;ve always been doing in-house. Can all of these B2B startups succeed chasing the same low-margin businesses?<p>It&#x27;s one thing if you&#x27;re making AWS and your customer is Netflix. They&#x27;re a huge, high-margin business—they can afford big B2B. But here, you&#x27;re trying to compete exceedingly few payment providers compete in: fees. And you&#x27;re asking for the lowest fees from the lowest margin business.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it just make more sense for the restaurant to be cash only?",1440711218

10132108,comment,10130512,10130512,0,0,Ologn,,,"> Challenge the when...for items on your critical path, it’s always useful to challenge the due date. All it takes is asking the simplest question: “Why can’t this be done sooner?” Asking it methodically, reliably and habitually can have a profound impact on the speed of your organization.<p>Sounds like a great organization - the person implementing something, who has the most knowledge of how long it will take to implement, needs to be &quot;challenged&quot; by someone who has no clue about how to implement what they are asking for or how long it will take.  What they are describing is a broken organization, or the beginnings of behavior that will break an organization.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s fine to say we need to prioritize implementing certain elements of business logic, so we&#x27;ll shrink the project scope so that those elements will be implemented faster.  But to advise people to &quot;habitually&quot; &quot;challenge&quot; every schedule given by implementers is pathological behavior.  It can work for a few months, but then the people doing the work get burned out and leave.<p>I have seen shops with confident IT managers who are not afraid to say &quot;no&quot; to unreasonable requests and deadlines, with a solid team of programmers and admins who have worked together for a while and get along, who have stayed at the company for a while and who have executed well on many projects together, with clean code bases and solid infrastructure, and who generally work forty hour work weeks, with the occasional marathon before a big release, or if things are breaking.<p>I have also seen shops with browbeaten IT managers, often new to the job, who are overrun by their bosses and business unit managers, with an IT team with a lot of turnover (except maybe 1 or 2 embittered people who have been there longer than the others), where people and departments are engaged in office politics, where projects have vague and ever-changing requirements, unrealistic deadlines, death march coding marathons by overworked coders, which are interrupted by putting out fires due to the code base with massive technical debt and broken infrastructure.  These are the kinds of companies where the executive &quot;habitually challenges&quot; deadlines the weak IT manager gives him, who gives in and dumps the new unrealistic deadline on his team.  This is the kind of company where a programmer is thrown into an existing project at the last minute, because the programmer who was working on it quit, and at your first meeting a Microsoft Project slide is shown and you&#x27;re told that you&#x27;re already three weeks behind schedule on your contribution.<p>Which of these two companies wind up succeeding, and which end up floundering or even failing?<p>(The only caveat I give to my own scenario, is that in companies where IT is not central to the business, they can often survive a broken IT department, when their core non-IT business is doing very well.  Their company would work even better if they followed the rational scenario, but their broken IT department is not always fatal to the company when they&#x27;re doing well in their core non-IT business.)",1440709703

I suspect if only a few engineers on the team actually enjoyed games and they were forced into a &quot;gaming company&quot; atmosphere they likely would have started putting in resumes after feeling like they were part of a &quot;bait and switch&quot;. You hired them to do one thing, and now it has become something else. There are other factors around the gaming industry that might cause them to jump ship (it&#x27;s well known amongst engineers that gaming companies are typically high turnover and low chance for long term success). Those engineers wanted to work on embedded systems and firmware, and have no desire to learn about gaming, so forcing them into it might backfire as &quot;just more bullshit from the manager&quot;.<p>I think forcing engineers to do customer support is a bad idea as well. You&#x27;re using something that should be seen in a positive light (helping the customer) as a punishment.<p>In both of these cases it seems like the solutions to things are to try to excite engineers about doing things they were not hired to do. Hire customer relations people to fight with the engineer FOR the customer. Bring in consultants to help plan what and how the gaming console should be done, and let the engineers code it.

I&#x27;ve struggled hard to keep it from impacting my work, but I still keep losing job after job.<p>It really seems like I can only invest half as much effort as my peers without experiencing severe burnout. I&#x27;m not talking about start-up people investing 80+ hour weeks, I&#x27;m talking about people doing 9 to 5 in big companies.<p>Programming is still on my short list of things I love, and I can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;d rather try to do for a living. It&#x27;s not my job that&#x27;s making me depressed--I still want to shoot myself on the weekends, too. I&#x27;m really at a loss as to what to do.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m in therapy and on medication (not that it seems to do a lot--I&#x27;ve lost count of how many medications I&#x27;ve tried). No, I&#x27;m not about to attempt suicide, though God knows I&#x27;d like to.<p>Is there any kind of a career that you know of that I might still succeed in? Something where a week here and there of being stuck in I-fucking-want-to-curl-up-and-cry mode isn&#x27;t a deal breaker?<p>As it stands, I&#x27;m broke enough that I can&#x27;t afford Silicon Valley any more, and I&#x27;m getting ready to pack up and move back in with my parents until I come up with something. I have a couple lifestyle business ideas I want to try, but I don&#x27;t have terribly high hopes for them. After that, all I can think of is trying some programming jobs outside the tech sector to see if they&#x27;re less stressful, or abandoning tech altogether and working Taco Bell or something.<p>Any ideas? Help?",1440709376

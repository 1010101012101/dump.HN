Then he digs up the origins of the concept in BCPL: the reason is that it made pointer arithmetic simpler. Oh.<p>And then he goes on a contrived (but still interesting) explanation of how it&#x27;s not because it made pointer arithmetic simpler but rather that it made it less CPU-intensive.

This is completely different than the fail-fast approach in Haskell or even Java, where the code is type-checked at the generic level.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - templates is an awesome, extremely powerful feature of C++, but it doesn&#x27;t play well with the rest of the language, and really feels tacked-on.",1382602110

For instance, in C you travel through an array using something like:<p><pre><code>    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n        a[i] = ...;\n</code></pre>\nWhere n is the length of the array. This is an idiom so common that if for some reason in some code the length of an array is (n + 1), instead of writing for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) I&#x27;ll write for (i = 0; i < (n + 1); i++).<p>Because the idiom is so strongly entrenched in my brain (and probably many other C coders) if I read the <= version there&#x27;s a great chance I&#x27;ll read it as a &quot;<&quot; and assume i goes from 0 to n - 1.<p>My point is adding several alternative &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; to express the same thing can end up confusing newbies because they&#x27;ll have to learn the difference between all version (and recognize them) as well as experienced coders because you&#x27;re more likely to mistake the meaning of an expression at a cursory glance.",1382602082

I&#x27;d seen these posters up with BASIC code on them and naively assumed that&#x27;s the kind of thing we&#x27;d do, only to turn up and literally to given print-outs going step-by-step how to use a word processor. &quot;Click Start&quot; (screenshot), &quot;Move the mouse to Programs&quot; (screenshot), etc. It was completely demoralizing for someone young and curious. And the teacher had zero interest too--no desire to hold a conversation or explain anything.

But I didn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m mildly irritated about that to this day--I&#x27;m only now picking up German again.

If you watch mainstream news after a massacre, you frequently see everything from video games, to the state flag, to national attitudes regarding mental illness, to bad parenting, to bullying, to nearly any other non-gun topic blamed for the tragedy.<p>As long as mass shootings are discussed as a uniquely &quot;US-issue&quot; and not simply as a uniquely &quot;Gun-ownership issue&quot; these red herring discussions will continue. Especially as the narrative that the US is different from the rest of the world is one we love to tell (even when negative). There is a difference, but that difference is only the # of guns. All other sociological differences don&#x27;t seem significant.<p>Now as I&#x27;ve said elsewhere in this thread, the issue of gun ownership has a heck of a lot more nuance than the two sides seem to recognize, and personally I find that I don&#x27;t have enough solid data to be pro-gun or anti-gun, and mostly just want for the country to finally agree this is an issue worth spending national dollars on studying.<p>But I think so far we&#x27;re much more likely to end up with studies on video game violence, mental health treatment models, etc, as NO ONE on TV utters anything but rhetoric after these events, and ironically these extremely rare and statistically insignificant (but anecdotally significant) events are the only time it comes up at all.<p>In fact, the leading cause of gun deaths in the US is suicide. And there&#x27;s actually some REALLY interesting data and discussion to be had there (such as extrapolating bridge suicide nets with successful suicides before and after), and with around 20,000 annually this is a much bigger public safety issue than a few hundred spree shooting deaths, but it&#x27;s also a discussion we&#x27;ll simply never have at a national level.",1436176427

That&#x27;s a distance of about 30 AU = 4.5 * 10^12 m = four and a half billion kilometers.<p>> The issue also crops up agian on some platforms that can do 128-bit float, but are then truncated down to 64-bits for storage.<p>Which CPU architectures use 128 bit floats internally? Is it common to use such platforms?<p>What comes to x87, I&#x27;d imagine that the difference in speed in comparison to SSE is already a good enough reason to not use 80 bit floats in most practical applications.<p>Perhaps some nuclear simulations or particle accelerator physics deal with numbers that vary in magnitude so greatly that increased precision may be useful but these cases are really rare (albeit important).",1436176335

For the last few years, I&#x27;ve found that Emotions vs Logic is very analogous to Magic vs Science.<p>&quot;Magic is just Science we don&#x27;t understand yet&quot;<p>&quot;Emotions are just Logic you don&#x27;t understand yet&quot;<p>When people believed Magic existed, and it was uncontrollable by the majority there were negative outcomes. Those with magic, exploiting those without it. Those without magic, fearing and killing those with it.<p>However, when the general attitude changed to: Although we don&#x27;t know the science behind it yet, everything happens for a reason. It gives people hope that they can uncover that reason. They are also less prone to being exploited by it and reduces the chances of fearing it. Succinctly, believing in Science democratizes access to &quot;Magic&quot;.<p>Similarly, if a person believes emotions are outside reason and therefore outside their control, they are more likely to succumb to them. Meanwhile, believing emotions are controllable, not only provides hope for people that dislike their current emotional state, but it is also directly proportional to increasing the belief that you are also in control of your response to those emotions.",1436173745

The only reason why the US has more of these shootings is because we have more guns, and reducing the number of guns will reduce the number of shootings.<p>However, the fact that these are extremely rare occurrences needs to be noted. Gun control has a lot more factors that are probably much more important than the rare issue of mass shootings.<p>To put it in perspective, doctors&#x27; sloppy handwriting kills roughly 7,000 people annually. That&#x27;s far more than combined spree shooting victims. Certainly mandating doctors to type out all communication would be much easier than the herculean task of ridding the US of guns.<p>And the broader gun control issue has other issues and data that would need to be examined. Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t have particularly good data regarding guns in the US due to the effective ban on government funded gun data (thanks NRA!).<p>Personally, I&#x27;d like to see the first step in gun control being federal funding directed toward research. Do guns (concealed carry, etc) actually deter other forms of violent crime? How many homeowners have used guns in self defense during a home invasion?<p>For example, a study in the 1990s found between 800,000 to 2.4 million defensive gun uses annually (Kleck & Gertz). And apparently while in the UK roughly half of all burglaries are when homeowners are present, in the US it&#x27;s only 13%. There&#x27;s also some data that suggests increases in crime rates in the years after gun bans, but the data comes from strong pro-gun sources and I&#x27;m a bit skeptical as to the validity.<p>Basically the data I could find regarding general gun control is spurious at best. We need better data on the pros and cons of gun ownership, and our decisions should be driven from that data and not anecdotal or tragic but extremely uncommon (statistically) events. So in my opinion, the rallying cry when national attention is on guns should not be taking head conjecture from all sides, but rather a national plea for better data so we can have an informed opinion on the issue.",1436173343

I did not set out to be an evangelist, more to educate myself about devops, and <a href=""https://sysadmincasts.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sysadmincasts.com</a> was the result. Ended up getting hired by one of the companies I created a video on (but not in an evangelist role).<p>Here&#x27;s some things to think about:<p><pre><code>  - you do not need to be an expert\n  - you can teach yourself to be an evangelist (probably the best way)\n  - 22 is *young* (I have 10 years on you)\n  - almost better if you know nothing as you learn from the ground up\n  - you will learn everything you need to know along the way\n  - possible to brute force your way into it via consistent hard work\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s my suggested strategy:<p>Start a blog or youtube channel where you review products around an eco-system. Boom, you now run your own evangelist company, congratulations! Keep at this consistently for a few years. Focus your reviews on a specific type of company or series of product lines. You will get on people&#x27;s radar. This will bring in job offers as you have proved yourself as an evangelist. A few things that I can think of off the top of my head re: the journey.<p><pre><code>  - pick an emerging tech eco-system (I chose devops)\n  - something shiny and new (devops)\n  - educate yourself about said eco-system\n  - educate others about what you learned (brain dumps)\n  - chunk these into small 1-2k word postings (blog or video)\n  - was doing a weekly text/video release (hope to get back on a schedule)\n  - it will be extremely painful in the beginning as you will suck (I did)\n  - you will quickly become better and improve your craft\n  - have a release cycle to keep you motivated with an end in sight\n  - set clear goals for what each posting will be about\n  - show examples (code, workflow, diagrams, etc)\n  - weekly cycle will force you to keep things small and workable\n  - just takes time and effort to research\n  - it&#x27;s easy to write simple brain dumps about what you learned\n  - this could take years (it did in my case)\n  - don&#x27;t write crap postings or spam content\n  - we are sick of corporate marketing/hype/vapor crap\n  - an unpolished human-to-human conversation works very well!\n  - show example use-cases (who, how, what, why, when, etc)\n  - think unboxing video for tech products (what does the gui look like)\n  - people will recognize you provide value\n  - this will open doors beyond your wildest expectations\n  - you will gradually become an expert\n  - very rewarding to help people from around the world\n  - can take over your life if you let it\n  - force yourself to keep quality up over all else (don&#x27;t be lazy)\n  - you can do this alongside your day job\n  - builds proof that you can be an evangelist\n  - you will become much better at distilling concepts\n  - this provides extreme value for time crunched people\n  - you taught yourself how to learn & keep current!\n</code></pre>\nThe trick is to keep yourself motivated. If you look at many information products today (podcasts, youtube channels, magazines), most of them follow a model like this, just copy it. Just the reward of helping others alone makes this worth it, so you really cannot go wrong! In that, even if you do not become a full-time evangelist, you have educated yourself, educated others, built a public profile, and that will pay off big time when looking for work in the future.",1436173258

To be honest I loved 37Signals approach to web apps and how they initially shunned outside funding to build their business. Granted that they started out as a consulting company? then morphed into a product company(which is an ideal route if you don't take oustide funding) But these days I'm finding it hard to use Basecamp(although they claim they produce easy to use software) I hope that they don't lose their initial focus. Their business model is sound so is their choice of niche market. Hope they don't stray away from that successful formula.",1177005595

14682,comment,14602,14602,0,0,madanella,,,"One important issue that seems to be missing from these discussions is that a lot of hiring is about internal team dynamics. The big fear I have is of people who don't want to hire employees that are smarter(broadest sense) than they are. One of the biggest benefits of working is the opportunity to work next to people you respect or enjoy. <p>For ambitious, smart people also known as 'A Players', it's not easy to provide them with an environment where they will feel challenged and inspired by their team members. But doing so greatly increases the likelihood of winning those hires. Why do so many 'A Players' want to work for Google? I believe that it's because there's a sense that other smart people work there. You get a network effect happening in the HR side of things. Think of reasons for attending Stanford and Harvard, it's not really about the quality of what will be taught but the assumed quality of the others in attendance. ",1177003136

Don't tell the squatter you have the .net & .org.  If you do, this will give him even more reason to keep the price high - he knows you want it!<p>2. Offer low, and make it sound like you don't really need the domain<p>3. Try to convince him that you've gotten an offer from someone else, selling a better domain, in your price range.  This works best if you know someone with a good domain name.  For example, I own odio.com.  I could send you an offer (from sam@odio.com) to sell odio.com for $500.",1177002438

14678,comment,14605,14616,0,0,dk,,,"A similar approach is so-called ""object prevalence"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Prevalence)."">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Prevalence).</a>  Basically, keep all the data in RAM and write a journal of changes.  On startup, the journal is played back, incrementally restoring the state.  Snapshots are taken periodically to keep the journal down to a manageable size.<p>It's a form of the Command design pattern and has some nice properties.  You can get transparent thread synchronization by executing queries in parallel but serializing commands that modify state.  For web apps, the HTTP request offers a natural representation for commands (but of course you'd want to strip them down to their essence).  You can get fault-tolerance and scalability by feeding the command stream to replica servers.  (State-changing commands must be executed by the master server but queries can be load-balanced across the replicas.)  And if you keep the journals around, you have a complete history of the application's state.<p>EDIT: See also <a href=""http://www.advogato.org/article/398.html"">http://www.advogato.org/article/398.html</a>",1177002371

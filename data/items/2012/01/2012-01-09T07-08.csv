I smell greed, regardless if people accept to be ripped of or not.<p>So, you expect Apple to manufacture in the States, and then sell it to you <i>without</i> a margin (over production costs)... And how exactly are those poor Apple engineers and Apple Store Employees are supposed to make money?<p>If some day Apple manufactures iDevices in America, then an iPad would cost $799, or Apple would go out of business.<p>This is not to say I'd like Apple's partner (Foxconn) to enslave chinese workers so I could buy an iPad cheaper...

Take city of million people. Take photo of one person.

I refused to buy anything new and would call a friend for his old iPod in a drawer when mine died.  This worked for a bit but has limitations.<p>I'm back in China now, after a two year break to the U.S.  Ten years in Shanghai was too much for me.  I needed some perspective from <i>home</i>.  Now I'm back, in Chengdu.  My rules are simple. In all aspects of my life, where I can, I incrementally raise the labor bar and try to provide more than <i>just a job</i>.  The IT projects I do, I tell my clients I only do high-end work and pay my talent well.  And I do pay them well; generally 50% to 200% over their prior jobs.  I also get to cherry pick the best talent and have very satisfied clients.  This approach has its limitations and I'll adjust my approach when I reach their limits.<p>For you, there are two things you can do:<p>1 - Choose wisely who you give your money to.  If you feel you can't easily raise the bar in the electronics you buy because all suppliers are playing the same game, do so in other aspects of your life.  For many, there is choice in food and other local things you buy.<p>2 - Get involved more closely in who your elected representative are.  These guys set the global and local trade rules.

Breaking even with co-op is out of the question for a lot of students, though it still helps a lot.<p>After all, without co-op, for most UW engineering programs you're now looking at $40-45K tuition + living costs + supplies/books... A $80-90K loan is not at all out of the question.",1326093204

Only trust open source peer reviewed products like TrueCrypt, GPG, etc.<p>If you want your data to be secure, use your own layer of encryption, preferably on your own physical disk or at the very least have the encryption executing in an environment you control. e.g. Not someone else's package of TrueCrypt running on their server, rather your verified package on your machine and then upload it.<p>Encryption is a major strategic issue and few governments will lay down and accept that their citizens or other countries have the ability securely store and transmit data.

My impression of the Canadian tech scene is that you've got a small number of innovative companies with great work environments amidst a sea of sweatshops and incredibly mind-numbing code outfits. When your alternative is <i>that</i>, of course retention is better.<p>For an employee it means you've essentially got them over a barrel.

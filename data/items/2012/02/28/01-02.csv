I live in Michigan and have known people who personally attest to all of the negative stereotypes about the Teamsters and the UAW.

Your true validation is recognition from the community, a ""watcher"" doesn't equate to a pat on the back, anymore than a ""like"" does. It's an inconsequential empty token. We need to get away from this notion of a like means anything more than an twitch response to something. It doesn't mean a person will ever return to your page if the project (or page or whatever) ever does anything again.

Your interests are never really going to change to the point that something you thought was spam one day would no longer be spam the next.  But with articles, what you might have found uninteresting one day may become interesting the next.  And what you thought was fascinating one day may become boring the next.<p>Thus, the need for continual training and re-training for spam is much less than it is for news articles and the like.<p>Because of this, the classification/reclassification process for news articles should be made as simple, quick and painless as possible.

3641442,comment,3636019,3638536,1,0,ekianjo,,,"Thanks for defining what you mean by exploitation. Now, exploitation can only exist in a market where workers have no choice but to accept the conditions of a single employer. This is typically the case when you are a slave for someone else and you have lost your freedom completely.<p>However, the have-nots (who are willing to work) can probably find several occupations, from different employers. They will have some range of choice concerning the salaries, the conditions and so on. Maybe not a large choice, but some choice. And one thing is clear: the less minimum wage there is, the more choice of occupations there will be, since there will be more employers generating occupations where profit can be made, since you lower the costs of labor at first.<p>Those occupations would not exist if it is easier or more profitable for people to stay on welfare.<p>And as it has been demonstrated in so many cases/countries, the longer one stays on welfare, the most likely one is not going to look for a job, welfare is actually a promoter of misery in the long term, especially for those who are at the very bottom, since they get no real incentive of getting out of it.<p>In a sense, politicians are guilty of exploitation as well, based on your definition. They take advantage of some voters' misery to promise them continuous welfare for which they are not responsible to pay for, and they further their own goals by getting rich in the process.<p>But, to come back on ""exploitation"" again. You are considering that is is a zero-sum game, basically. One, the exploiter, is gaining something while the exploited is losing. But economics almost never work that way. Both employer and employee have something to gain out of it. Both profit from the situation. The Employer makes money, can extend his business and ends up needing more people in his payroll. The Employee makes enough money to survive, has an occupation and has a social activity within society - they build relationship/reputation and somehow experience. They may not be making much monetary profit, but they are still gaining something out of it.<p>Please do not forget that all people who lived before us had to go through misery before reaching nowadays' living standards. If you come back a hundred years ago, then you may well consider that everyone then was being ""exploited"", but that is not how they would see themselves at the time.",1330393704

The Kronstadt Rebellion and Solidarity had nothing to do with ""refusing to work"", and all to do with fighting the state power for more freedom.<p>That said, it's not either corporate capitalism (as described in the article) or USSR.

If you've grown up and started your career in an atmosphere of tough working conditions and demanding expectations, then as an employer you're going to have similar expectations of the people you hire.

And we also need to acknowledge that the management in a company invariably enjoys collective bargaining rights, and that basic human decency demands that we allow non-management employees to have similar rights.<p>Which is not to say that all unions are well-behaved.  My time as a Teamster was both instructive and discouraging. They had secured a lot of provisions that I don't think should have been allowed to stand.  For one, joining the union was a condition of employment.  If that requirement didn't violate the principle of free labor markets, it at least cut close to the line. And they eradicated all traces of meritocracy; the only thing that could ever be rewarded was seniority. That was deeply discouraging for a new employee, and from the company's perspective it ensured that the highest-paid employees were also the least productive, by virtue of having spent the most time observing that hard work would never be met with any reward aside from itself.<p>However, we should not throw the baby out with the bath-water. Unions should be allowed to exist; history is rife with practical examples what happens if you don't do so.<p>And frankly, the potential problems posed by unions can naturally be addressed by the free market itself, if only we'd let it.  If a company's compensation structure becomes unsustainable due to more efficient competition from another company, then it is absolutely OK to simply let its more efficient competitors out-compete it.

In this specific case, running MPD into an Icecast stream means that I have remote access to my music library from anywhere, and using flacsync to make lossy copies of my FLAC files means that it's easy for me to manually manage the library on my MP3 player. All this without the pain of having to deal with the issues that this article talks about.<p>Obviously this setup is rather technical, and requires a nontrivial bit of setup work, but the fact that it is often easy to have ideas for substantial life improvements and then implement them well, with free software, has left me a bit disenchanted with the offerings from large, generally innovative companies like Google and Apple (a similar hack for streaming music to an AirPort Express from MPD can be had with the raop-play module for PulseAudio, for example).",1330391518

The concept of protecting workers from abuses by corporations is not in and of itself undesirable.  As we have seen all throughout human history those who wield power usually abuse it.<p>The issue with unions, as most people in America view them, is that they became to powerful themselves.  This allowed them to make demands that would ultimately lead to their organizations becoming hamstrung and unable to rapidly adjust.  Hence business look at them as the plague.<p>The issue as I see it is that business, labor, and consumers need to understand the concept of ""moderation"".  Consumers do not need an abundance of cheap crap.  Businesses shouldn't focus solely on short term profits.  Unions should seek to protect their workers and not pry as much money as they possibly can out of their employer.",1330391193

He may be referring to other projects on GitHub, but even Twitter Bootstrap[3] (the most popular GitHub project), almost never loses watchers. Granted, these projects could all be gaining just a few more watchers than they are losing per hour, but the net effect is almost always a gain each day.<p>I think the real problem is that watching a repository doesn't  engage a user in its contents.

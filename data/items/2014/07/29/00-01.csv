Given the fact that IR cameras in orbit can measure surface temperature, I think a significant amount of heat must be escaping.  This seeming contradiction may simply be my misunderstanding.  Can you clarify the point you are making with that article?<p>>water is already present in the atmosphere<p>Yes water in the atmosphere is at an equilibrium.  Adding more water has only a short term effect unless it somehow changes that equilibrium.  Water has a large greenhouse effect and without that effect Earth would be much colder.  If that effect were to increase Earth would get hotter, but fortunately the excess water simply falls out of the sky instead. That&#x27;s why it is so important that water falls out of the sky.  CO2 on the other hand is not at an equilibrium thus its effect can build up over time.<p>>It would, if it was fact<p>It is an observation.  We can literally observe it happening.  That does not tell us precisely how it would function under different conditions (such as increased CO2), so for that we must rely on theory.  That theory, because it is based on flawed human understanding is fallible.  Our conclusions about man made global warming are less than 100% certain.<p>>There&#x27;s no magic in greenhouse effect that would cause it important when proven unimportant. Having this, it&#x27;s way, way too early to panic about the greenhouse effect.<p>I am of course not recommending panic.  If the greenhouse effect were proven unimportant (and either I understood said proof, or some reasonable portion of the scientific community agreed with it) then I would stop worrying about CO2 emissions.  Given that theory explains why we should expect green house emissions to increase temperature, the strong correlation between the two and the lack of other credible explanations, I come to the obvious (though not completely certain) conclusion.",1406594834

Their primarily financial goal is to complete the sale. Whether this means that you are overpaying (or, for a seller&#x27;s agent, are under-asking), or are buying a home that isn&#x27;t right for you...that often matters less than simply closing the deal.<p>2) <i>Never</i> trust or take a recommendation for a home inspector or other service recommended by the agent. The home inspector has the motive of keeping the agent bringing the recommendations, and this means avoiding having findings that will compromise the deal. Remember, the agent only makes money when the sale completes, so if they spool someone along to buy a house, convince them to overpay to get a sale done, and then bring in the &quot;best&quot; home inspector they know to close the sale, that inspector had better not throw a wrench in it. Always consider conflicts of interest, and there is an enormous one if you use the agents contacts.<p>3) The legal work -- the bulk of the paperwork, and covering your back legally and so on -- is, in many jurisdictions, done by a lawyer, not a real-estate agent who is only responsible for the most cursory of forms. And that lawyer and his team of paralegals, who do all of the title checks and bank processes and the final close...they get a small fraction of what the real-estate agent gets.<p>I find real-estate agents to be a profound anachronism.

Much more important is build times.  That is compile, test, package loops.  I hardly ever compile in isolation.  I am usually running tests, doing code generation, building artifacts as well as compiling.  As soon as this is true, compilation times tend to be dwarfed by the rest of the process.  Thus my point about compile times being low on my priority list (though I won&#x27;t defend them).<p>For instance, lots of people mention Go compile times during discussions such as this and I find that argument non-compelling for the simple reason that on small projects the difference is imperceptible and on large projects the other factors I mention dwarf compile times in either case.<p>I will say thanks for the concrete time period definition though.  5-10 second turn around seems like a trivial time to argue about to  me.  If I have to look up from my editor for 1 second it might as well be 30.  Anything more than 30 is context switch time.  I haven&#x27;t had to deal with incremental build/test loops longer than 30 seconds in a long time and Scala certainly doesn&#x27;t require them.  Again, I&#x27;m perfectly willing to concede this could be a generational difference as I&#x27;ve worked on projects that had compile times measured in hours and (automated) test cycles measured in days.",1406593050

Our users are great fans of Vagrant and Packer, so +1 for those.<p>From a cursory overview, it looks like Terraform is basically LIKE a CloudFormation type abstraction.  Ansible contains declarative models for lots of cloud providers as well, but does not attempt to abstract out the different clouds.  We generally view wanting to show things in their natural state (figuring you will know you want to use feature X or Y, and want the knobs/buttons exposed).<p>But yes, we have similar features for saying &quot;X instances of this should be running now&quot;, make it so, all that don&#x27;t require use of CloudFormation.<p>For people that like Terraforms flavor though, I can see users using these tools together.   They could declare a cloud using either ansible or terraform, and then use ansible for the final configuration and application deployment, plus full lifecycle management.<p>I know things like Packer like to walk people down a more imagey road, but you can also use config tools to describe the recipes that build your images, and that would include Ansible, Puppet, Chef, or even (if you so wished) bash.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of bash though :)<p>I&#x27;m happy to see more efforts to make cloud provisioning accessible though, and like the idea that this would allow more easy migration between some cloud providers.  Ansible has a lot of the same declarative thingies, but will probably appeal more to people who aren&#x27;t looking for the DSL.<p><a href=""http://docs.ansible.com/list_of_cloud_modules.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.ansible.com/list_of_cloud_modules.html</a><p>It doesn&#x27;t look like Terraform is attempting to be a provisioner itself, so it wouldn&#x27;t do the things that Ansible or other config/app deploy tools do once you have a running instance, but does some of the things various config tools do to help you GET a running instance.<p>One of the things shown in the Ansible examples are how to do a cloud deploy in one hop, i.e. request resources and also configure the stack all the way to the end, from one button press, and can also be used to orchestrate the rolling updates of those machines, working with the cloud load balancers and so on, throughout their entire life cycle -- all using just the one tool.<p>As for where the future of this tool is, I obviously can&#x27;t speculate, nor should I.  But I do welcome more attempts to simplify beasts like the AWS EC2 API space, because I think we both agree nobody wants to really keep all of that in their head at all times.",1406593042

Maybe he was just playing dumb, I don&#x27;t know.<p>He probably wasn&#x27;t. That having been said, the inability to understand abstract concepts like the time value of money and being a kickass salesman are not mutually exclusive. Some of the best agents I&#x27;ve met aren&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call bright, but they&#x27;re quite successful and have <i>incredible</i> sales skills that smarter agents lack.<p>> Anyway, in my experience, most agents are happy wasting a bunch of time on a sale - having coffee to discuss &#x27;the status&#x27; (2 viewings scheduled for next week, the one from last Monday seemed genuine - could have send me a 2 line email.<p>This isn&#x27;t remotely irrational -- you just don&#x27;t understand his purpose. What he&#x27;s doing by spending 45 minutes chatting with you, in leu of a 2 line email, is building a relationship with you and giving the transaction a more personal touch. These are the kind of soft sales skills that are critical to being a successful agent, since despite the existence of sites like Trulia or Zillow, the majority of your clients will come not from online advertising but from word of mouth. So sure, a 2 line email might have sufficed, but a 45 minute chat where he tells you funny stories is going to leave you feeling a lot better cared for (because, well, you are), and leaves you more inclined to recommend him to your friends in the future.<p>Plus, you said it&#x27;s a bad market. It&#x27;s probably not the case that he has clients banging down his doors, so he needs to make sure that his existing clients are well cared for to ensure future business.",1406592206

I recently became an independent consultant after 10+ years as a salaried developer and while I&#x27;m happy with my existing clients and work, I have noticed some quirks in communication when advertising my services.<p>Specifically, when I have posted in the <i>Freelancer? Seeking freelancer?</i> thread, I have had the following happen twice:<p>1. High-ranking person from company X contacts me with a brief problem description and asks whether I&#x27;m interested. In one case they also asked for my rates.<p>2. I respond in a timely, enthusiastic and well-crafted (if I may say so) fashion with the info they requested.<p>3. I never hear from them again.<p>I&#x27;ve played the online dating game (happily married now), so I have a thick skin for rejection and not getting a response. However, this is quite a bit different. First, these organizations contact <i>me</i>, seemingly with a need and with questions. They are asking me to take the time to respond. I fully understand that they probably contacted multiple candidates, but I feel it would be proper etiquette for them then to notify those who they don&#x27;t select.<p>This is not like a job posting where the applicant initiates the conversation. The clients are starting and then abandoning the conversation.<p>In the dating game, my thoughts would be &quot;They&#x27;re flaky, you dodged a bullet&quot;, but these two requests came from a startup with a decent seed round and a large, established professional organization. So I&#x27;m wondering if this is an acceptable norm?<p>Would love to hear opinions from more experienced freelancers.",1406592023

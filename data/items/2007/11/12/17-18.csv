Unfortunately, studios have too much power and control, and not that many directors get the final cut on their movies.  As a result, there are many unhappy artists, as their works are greatly influenced, and changed by those in power.  Most studios have no respect for the art work and merely look at it as a business opportunity and will change the creative work to whatever that will potentially sell more and make them more money.  Therefore, this transition could be the end of all those ""Hollywood endings.""  (Blade Runner, Apocalypse Now, Once Upon a Time in America, American History X, are just a few examples).  <p>I have to mention though that this problem will not be even completely solved with Mark's proposition either.  Rebuilding Hollywood in Silicon Valley's image will have its disadvantaged too.  I believe doing so will not build Hollywood as today's image of Silicon Valley but rather an image of the Valley in the mid 90's, and the dot-com era.  (I am not suggesting there will be a bubble, but its possible, and I don't think it'll ever be as bad as the tech one, since the industry is already mature and the players are very experienced, so the chances of failure are a lot less.)  But in terms of the structure of the companies and the process there will be similarities.  As we have seen over and over, startups that end up doing whats to the best interest of the VCs (or at least what the VCs believe is to their best interest) instead of doing what the founders would like to do (there are thousands of these stories but my favorites are Jim Clark and Silicon Graphics, and to some extend Steve Jobs and Apple, which proves this could have happened to anyone at any level!).  But as there will be a lot more producers compared to the few currently available studios there will be better chances to find investors that think like you, so there will still be improvements. <p>Hollywood 2.0\nBut this transition will be a lot faster.  As the technology improves and all costs of production, marketing, distribution go down, eventually a lot less capital would be needed to put together a movie, which will lessen the power of the producers and set the creative minds free.  (similar to what we are  experiencing in Silicon Valley today!).  <p>I can't wait to see three different versions of the same story and movie coming out during the same year.  Or the redone of older movies with similar plots but different themes and endings.  I can't wait to see the personal touch of many creative people that never had a chance to offer their talents before.  And maybe one day in the future I'll be sharing movies with my friends that they have previously seen or know about, but can now see it with my touch on top of it, and from my point of view.  Maybe one day critics instead of pointing out what they like or don't like, they can modify the movies themselves and offer their own versions to their viewers (I might be getting really ahead of myself but I get excited when I think like this.)  And instead of movie guide you'll check digg.com to see what you should watch today.<p>But last time anything close to this happened (but not even close to the potentials here) some great talents came out of Hollywood.  We saw movies like Easy Rider, and great directors like Scorsese, Coppola, Spielberg, Lucas changing the way we think about movies.<p>Side Notes:\nWhat I mention above does not apply to all categories of movies, as many of them (such as most of TV shows, and reality shows) can be produced today for very little capital.  But for the feature length movies, and mostly those that are produced for theaters, you will still need a huge capital for production.\n",1194890196

In one of the lectures the professor talked about the degree to which the age of a counterparty matters to negotiators from different cultures.

78780,comment,78744,78744,0,0,geebee,,,"This is an interesting post.  There are a couple of points that I'm hesitant on, though.  I wouldn't necessarily say I disagree with his position - just that I think there are some points that might need a bit more elaboration (ok, a bit more defending).<p>First is that the Hollywood model for talent may be an improvement over Silicon Valley in some ways.  Kathy Sierra wrote a great post on this a while back:<p><a href=""http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/02/dont_ask_employ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/0...</a><p>In short - the Hollywood model where everyone comes together to complete a project and goes off looking for a new gig after it is completed may be a better model for tech work than the employer/employee model.  This model heavily rewards talent that gets things done, and has no place for seat warmers.  I do agree with Marc that it's good for the creators to be stakeholders with a share in the output - so that would improve things.  Maybe this explains so much of the job hopping that goes on in Silicon Valley.  Perhaps developers should vest at the completion of a product?  After all, top talent at Google may be sitting around with golden handcuffs when they could be working on the next great release...<p>Another factor is the extreme expense of producing a truly professional film.  Yes, technology is getting cheaper and more available, but tens of millions is still a small budget for a feature film.  I'm not a big fan of special effects for their own sake, but I thought ""Jurassic Park"" was pretty much awesome, took trememdous technical expertise and innovation, and was ultra-expensive.  I suppose this capital could now be raised from VCs rather than studio heads.<p>Think VC's in the film industry would be willing to give the same kind of creative freedom we (only sometimes) see in tech startups?  It's a tempting idea, no doubt about it...",1194889146

78778,comment,65815,68948,0,0,twinings,,,"If you go back far enough, there were no cities at all.   Nevertheless, I think there is a wonderful ""city"" concept in many old towns around the world, and especially in Europe.  If you move to Silicon Valley, and you spend some significant fraction of your life there, then your day to day quality of life is seriously affected by this.   This  discussion thread may be getting ""off topic"", although it is about an article telling entrepreneurs from all around the world to come to Silicon Valley if they possibly can.   I am warning them.  It's not a paradise (in my opinion.) \n ",1194888909

78773,comment,78594,78678,0,0,jey,,,"Yes, that's an anecdote. It was meant to be an illustrative point, not a scientific factually valid point. You should read the EvPsych literature to get the scientific argument. I don't know enough about it to cite the papers, etc. Another book that looks at factors involved in the evolution of the human brain is The Symbolic Species by Terrence Deacon, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Symbolic-Species-Co-Evolution-Language-Brain/dp/0393317544"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Symbolic-Species-Co-Evolution-Language...</a><p>""<i>The answer is memes. And the short reason why is: memes evolve much, much faster than genes, so once they existed, they got to do everything mind-related, and biological evolution no longer got to do anything. This also explains why genes aren't a suitable answer :)</i>""<p>Yes, memes exist, and they do quite a lot, but it's not like as soon as memes showed up, everything else went out the door! Even if we assume that memes had some ability to thwart further biological evolution, that wouldn't <i>reverse</i> all of the built-in stuff that existed at the point memes came on the scene. Everything that memes do is layered on top of the huge amount of pre-programming that we're born with; memes exist solely on the highest thin layer of a big multi-layered system. Don't forget that we're actually primates with primate brains, and mammals with mammal brains. Millions of years of mammalian brain evolution weren't discarded just because we invented a vehicle for meme transmission (language). That high-level idea transmission mechanism resides on top of a regular ol' primate brain, with all of its complex builtin emotions for survival, reproduction, social interaction, etc. <p>Anyway, I'm not an expert on this stuff, so I can't put together a really convincing argument citing specific experimental facts and whatever. I'm starting to repeat myself ... shows how little I know about this stuff. You should read some of the stuff on EvPsych to draw your own conclusions about the validity of the field.<p>Check out this blog post on Overcoming Bias: <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/evolutionary-ps.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/evolutionary-ps.html</a>",1194887516

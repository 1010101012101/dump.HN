The CDC says [1] for the MMR vaccine:<p><pre><code>   Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic\n   reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other\n   component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine.\n</code></pre>\nNeomycin is used in many topical creams and ointments, so there are opportunities to find out that you have a problem with it other than through vaccination.<p>Also, as you noted, some vaccines are twice in a lifetime. MMR, for example, is given at ~1 year old, and at 4-6 years old. If someone has a life-threatening reaction the first time, the CDC says that they should not get the second dose.<p>Note that MMR vaccine allergies are very rare, so we aren&#x27;t talking about a huge number of people who have to go around without MMR vaccination.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmr.html</a>",1403416768

That&#x27;s f&#x27;ing insane!<p>I think there&#x27;s a MUCH bigger privacy issue here than what the author focuses on.<p>Couldn&#x27;t you deduce many <i>passenger</i> identities based on addresses? There&#x27;s a lot of scenarios where passenger identities could be effectively de-anonymized, just based on GPS data. You could then use this data set to analyze their comings and goings.<p>1. For people who live alone in a single family home, you can pretty much completely track when and where they went by taxi. From this you can deduce a lot about their interests, lifestyle, workplace and schedule, private life, etc. It&#x27;s profoundly invasive.<p>2. Even if there&#x27;s a few people sharing an address, the other dropoff/pickup point can be used to narrow down the likelihood of who it is, especially when combined with other easily obtainable data.<p>For example if you knew an employee (e.g. that cute barista) lived in a certain neighborhood you could track their trips to/from work and deduce their home address.<p>Or if you knew there was only one senior citizen (or Muslim, etc.) living in a building, a regular trip to a senior center (or mosque) would reveal when their apartment is vacant.<p>Or if there&#x27;s only one young man in a building, a single trip home from a gay bar could out them.<p>Holy shit.. can you imagine someone just plotting all the trips from a single gay bar? Listing off all the connected residential addresses? And not only that, <i>any subsequent trips home from those addresses the next morning</i>? Taking the walk of shame to a whole new level!<p>Likewise trips could be used to deduce affairs and other deceptions by fellow residents. &quot;You said you were working late, but the only taxi trip to our building that night was from a bar.&quot;<p>This is just off the top of my head.. I feel I could go on for hours listing all the possible ways this data set could be exploited.<p>How is this not front page New York Times???",1403416683

Open Knowledge festival is going to be off the hook :)<p>I realized you and your team (Peter et al.) have been working on a project in a similar space, and was hoping there would some beneficial overlap. It looks like there is! The ScraperJSON definitions for publishers sounds like exactly what Scholar Ninja needs. Let&#x27;s chat soon :)<p>Thanks you for the quick description of ContentMine, the more awareness about this projects, the better. I&#x27;ve talked to Peter Murray-Rust on a few occasions and have to say that what you are doing with ContentMine is phenomenal and I wish you all the best. I hope you&#x27;ll see that our projects are complimentary rather than competitive.<p>About indexing full texts: We do generate keyword indexes based on full texts, but we do not add this full text to the network. I hope you can see what I&#x27;m saying: you can still search through full text, but you can&#x27;t access full text, it doesn&#x27;t exist on the network, only a keyword: [entry1, entry2,...] index exists.

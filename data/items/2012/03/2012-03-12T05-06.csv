I'd conjecture the vast majority of people are subjected to tangential distraction - youtube, facebook, wikipedia, reddit, hackernews, tumbler, twitter, whatever your poison.<p>The question is merely the quality of the distraction - if there is something such as 'distract better', perhaps we should be exploring that. Sadly, my general experience has been that the vast majority of distracted time yields negligible gain compared to concentrated pursuit of a field.<p>Serendipity, yes, but I find I'm far more prone to serendipity when I'm concentrated than when I'm not. Firm believer that you always find what you're looking for - and the more concretely you know what you're looking for, the faster you'll find it.",1331531996

I was using him, wrongly, as an example of the technocratic tendency to not consider morality in decision-making. However, I'll continue here with a response to your objections pretending he really is a less well-rounded VC:<p>I think your responses are emblematic of a current societal tendency to be easy on leadership and powerful people, because they're ""just human."" I don't agree with that tendency to not hold leaders accountable to a higher standard, and I don't think it's right for a person with that much power to not have a clear moral position on who he or she does business with. We can all disagree on what we think is right, but I think there are many who have been led to believe that they simply can't expect more out of certain people because it's not ""fair."" I'm merely providing a counter-opinion to that.<p>About the humanities, that was said out of frustration that you/others may not have been exposed to moral frameworks outside of the traditional religious and political tie-ins. It was an incorrect sweeping generalization, but regardless, it doesn't hurt anyone to be reminded of these subjects now and again :)",1331531466

We are excited to announce that since technology entrepreneurship is a team-based activity, we've built a team-building tool to help enable team formation.<p>When you sign in at http://venture-lab.org, we're asking that you enter some basic information such as location, age, and industry so that we can suggest teammates for the course project. If you have your own team already of 3-4 people, that's great, you'll be able to enter those teammates into the site. For those who do not have a team or are looking to add teammates, we can assist you with finding others who are in a similar geographic location and interested in a similar industry sector. We are asking that you sign in (preferably using your Google gmail) and complete this before the end of the day March 18th, midnight PST. The course will launch soon, so we wanted to get started in the next few weeks to help you build teams and brainstorm initial ideas for your startup projects.<p>Later on, you can use venture-lab.org to post your ideas for the class startup project, your interim reports, and the final project. You will be also able to see and comment on other teams work. We will ask a group of area experts and experienced entrepreneurs to help and mentor a select group of projects.<p>This gives a chance for thousands of people around the world to form groups, come up with new ideas, and collaborate to implement it. We are very excited about the possibilities for a model of online education that provides tools for students to collaborate and learn from one another as well as the instructor.<p>The course overview video can be seen here: http://eesley.blogspot.com/2012/02/course-overview.html<p>Chuck Eesley

In the case of Rapportive, we had 3 cofounders, all needing visas; 3 turns out to be the perfect number for H1B purposes, because any two of you own enough of the company to fire the third.  That sounds a bit circular, but made enough sense to USCIS that we got our visas, even though none of us was a US citizen.

7474275,comment,7474272,7474272,4,0,zvanness,,,"Hey HN!<p>Zach from Breue here.<p>Breue started as Headlinr - a billboard for startup and product launches. Well, it was actually a curated list of useful good looking products.<p>From the products rejected on Headlinr, many of the founders reached out to us, asking how they could improve their products. We noticed a pattern of designers and coders unsure of what to build and how to launch their products.<p>So, we put together a little experiment called the Screening Room and ran it for a week. The results were spectacular. It became clear where we needed to focus our time and energies.<p>So, we built Breue. <p>Typically, we try to get product advice and feedback by posting somewhere online where people can see it. You receive a bunch of mixed advice. Only a few people give you good advice and feedback. And you have to deal with snark and hateful remarks.<p>Breue is a community where people give you the best advice and direction they can on your vision, business, product, product flaws, etc. So far, there has been zero snark. There are no remarks like &quot;looks cool&quot; or &quot;sounds interesting&quot;. Just really helpful, worthwhile, invaluable stuff.<p>We&#x27;ve put together an amazing community of smart talented people who want to learn from and help each other out. As a member of the community, you get to engage with other smart talented people. You get to see, read, and hear things that others don&#x27;t. You get to help shape things.<p>Please take a minute to read testimonials by founders of products showcased on Breue:<p><a href=""http://breue.com/stories"" rel=""nofollow"">http://breue.com/stories</a><p>I&#x27;m here to answer any questions from the HN community!",1395849565

7474263,comment,7473787,7473787,2,0,julie1,,,"most startups have bogus business plan: the recession is worldwide, and the web2.X gold rush is about selling productivity to startups (mainly).\nLike in the gold rush the one who are making actual money are not the one digging gold but the landlord selling the &quot;startup ground&quot; (incubators), and the companies selling the tools to dig. \nSecondly whatever they say no silver bullets appeared in the last 10 years: the mythical good developers with a productivity = 10x average (quantity & quality) are still a resource. They are scarce, I have met some, I don&#x27;t belong to them. As a result, business plan relies for their costing on a resource that is very unpredictable. As a result companies relying too much on &quot;new technologies&quot; based their hiring policy on a brute force attack.<p>Wait, you tell me there are a lot of devs on the market? \nNo, there are a lot of clueless young people on the market with a huge student loan that studied CS but that maybe the worst developer ever but have a strong incentive to get hired (cheat): they have to reimburse their loans before they sleep under the bridge.<p>So, brute force attack require to hire a lot of expensive broken arms. If I were a recruiter, I would never hire a student with a loan to refund that young I would prefer an autodidact that understand the basic of economy: don&#x27;t spend money you don&#x27;t have and don&#x27;t be a sheep.<p>Lastly the money for startups even if QE is turning in all worldwide economies is not there!\nCentral banks are printing bank notes like mad men (China, Japan, US, Europe...) but this money is directly used in stock options and the bank never landed that few money (or when they do the compound interests are just mad). And public and private debts are fucking high. The economy is on the brink of a bubble explosion for which new startup are responsible.<p>So there is no money to turn startup that don&#x27;t master their costing/pricing in real companies. (no money available on the credit market)<p>Yes basically startups is a phony ecosystem.<p>My advice: have balls.<p>Go for companies that do not label them startups that seems «unsexy», even with lower wages, and accept the job after you accept and understand their mission/business model.<p>Maybe helping family planning communicate better on their mission can be more satisfying in life than helping a delusive «self made man» have is first million before 25 based on a ponzi scheme (buying tools to startups that buys me tools without generating new products is a little mad, isn&#x27;t it?).",1395849488

7474258,comment,7469115,7469115,4,0,erikpukinskis,,,"I guess I&#x27;m in the minority, but I think Facebook is a fascinating parent for Oculus.<p>Oculus has a technology head start, but that only gives them maybe a couple years on the cheap duplicators. In order to gain a strategic foothold their real competition is in their &quot;app store&quot;/content portal aspirations. They&#x27;re in a race to see whose virtual space you start in when you put on your VR headset.<p>But in that realm they are competing with Sony, Microsoft, and Valve, all of whom have large user bases already using their portals. On that battle Oculus is at a severe disadvantage. By joining Facebook they have a network of users they can plug into, and a much bigger one than their competitors at that.<p>Second, Oculus is run by hardware and software engineers. They have an extraordinary team in that regard, which has allowed them to hire and expand in those areas very fast and still keep the talent bar high.<p>In order to build a compelling portal in a totally unmapped design language, they need world class UX and social designers. Because they are so engineering heavy, I don&#x27;t think they would have an easy time identifying and integrating those people as an independent company, even with Andreesen/Horowitz pulling strings for them.<p>Facebook already has some great, productive, battle hardened UX teams, and I suspect they have many of the best social designers in the world. By selling to Facebook, Oculus is taking that huge question mark off the table.<p>In exchange they&#x27;ve taken on the question mark of possibly fading into obscurity in an indifferent parent organization. That&#x27;s a roll of the dice. But the worst care scenario for them is they quit and start over with a LOT of cash, a rockstar reputation, and a knowledge of exactly what their acquired ghost company is organzationally incapable of doing.<p>And lastly, I don&#x27;t think Palmer cares if HE wins. He wants to pull as much resources into the VR project as he can. Full stop. He&#x27;d happily sacrifice his company to do that. If Valve wins and he quits Facebook having failed to make it work there, he&#x27;ll boot into Steam VR with a huge smile on his face knowing that <i>he won</i>.",1395849459
7474257,comment,7472452,7474097,10,0,nbouscal,,,"The notion that terms like &quot;monad&quot; are nothing but shibboleths is very common and completely misguided. Instead, these terms are used for a couple of very good reasons.<p>First, the simple reason that they are accurate terms for which there are no good replacements. The English language does not have the necessary scope to cover the relevant abstractions. This leaves you with two options: use the accurate term from mathematics, or make up some new term. Either way the term will be something new to most people, and making something up does not provide any value.<p>This leads me to the second reason: the mathematical terms actually do provide additional value. If you are working with monoids and do some Googling, you can discover a wealth of information that is directly applicable in practice, for example you can learn that List is the initial monoid [1]. You don&#x27;t have to learn any of this, it&#x27;s completely optional, but if you do choose to explore it you can get real benefits. Renaming monads &quot;workflows&quot; would prevent you from gaining those benefits, and would not get you anything in exchange other than making the people who are scared of math more comfortable.<p>[1] An example of why this is useful to know: <a href=""http://byorgey.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/foldr-is-made-of-monoids/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://byorgey.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/foldr-is-made-of-mon...</a><p>Also this post from the wiki, though it&#x27;s a bit heavier on the theory: <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Free_structure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Free_structure</a>",1395849449

People were primarily responding to how great it was to have &quot;their stuff&quot; anywhere they happened to sit down, and how horrible the native client experience was, on Windows.<p>And we&#x27;ve had a great natural test of that theory, with modern mobile devices:  Now that people have their own machine with them, wherever they happen to be, with native client experiences that aren&#x27;t nearly the hassle that desktop Windows was, web apps are playing second-fiddle.<p>Similarly, this VDI thing is going to run into trouble as enterprise further adopts BYOD and their desktop images are needed by fewer and fewer people.",1395849063

I think the DK1&#x27;s modest GPU demands have given people a misleading impression of what CV1 will actually cost to run. If Oculus takes the high road and ships a 2560×1440@90Hz CV1 before the end of 2014 then the total buy-in cost at launch could be $800-$900 even for most people who already have their own gaming PC handy: you&#x27;d need a powerful and power-hungry GPU, and no currently-existing SLI/Crossfire setup is going to cut it either.<p>With such uncertain prospects for going it alone it seems clear why Oculus would want to be bought by Facebook; like a typical FB acquisition, what&#x27;s less clear is why FB would want to buy Oculus, since the Rift will have comparatively few owners at first even if all goes well. Three possibilities:<p>1) Zuckerberg is worried that Oculus and all the other VR efforts could fail, leaving FB without a Next Big Thing to evolve into in future years as VR becomes affordable<p>2) Zuckerberg is worried that Oculus could fail while Project Morpheus succeeds, leaving VR a failure on the PC but successful on consoles. Sony would love to have its own hit social network, or to make Facebook grovel to gain access to the PS4 platform; Facebook would not enjoy it so much<p>3) Zuckerberg is another starry-eyed Oculus-loving geek, but unlike all the others he has the spare change to make sure that the VR dream stays alive<p>My hunch is that it&#x27;s some combination of all three. Other people are worried about FB wanting to exert proprietary control over the Rift &quot;platform&quot;; I&#x27;m less worried about that. If the Rift is a hit on the PC it will have competitors, which will put manners on Facebook and/or just give people somewhere else to go. If Oculus had gone it alone and failed, likely there would be no successful competitors for several years either, and FB logins would be the least of our concerns.",1395848665

He learned how to raise money by selling his business idea to other people who think like him. He learned about how to manage people, perform marketing, design products, and set priorities for his organization.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to suggest this is the type you&#x27;re working with here, but I offer a relatable character to which you can add traits or from which you can remove them to fit the particulars of your experience.<p>For him, running a business is as much an exercise in tradeoffs and compromises as building an engineering system probably is for you:<p>You end up running with an imperfect design because of time constraints and because you&#x27;re a slave to shipping. He runs with an imperfect business plan because that&#x27;s what his board thinks is best and because he&#x27;s a slave to their opinions. You devote time and energy to a technology only to have it fail when you need it most. He pursues partnerships and deals that fall through because of unforeseen differences, despite his best efforts. You end up rewriting your architecture because it didn&#x27;t meet your requirements as well as you expected. He pivots the business because his original business plan isn&#x27;t panning out as he anticipated. Et cetera.<p>The point is that generally people in management can be assumed to be doing their best. Despite what hacker news and TechCrunch try to convince you, running a company is a job just the same as building an engineering system. Incentives aren&#x27;t always aligned, you have to cut corners, and conflicts are unavoidable. As someone on the inside of engineering divisions of technology giants, I can tell you that you get this sort of conflict and frustration even at these &quot;engineering-first&quot; sorts of places.<p>Naturally some companies are better than others. You want to find a manager who thinks of himself as your equal rather than your slaver. Instead of asking yourself &quot;does this management know what it&#x27;s doing?&quot; ask yourself &quot;does this management make me better as a professional?&quot; If you can say &quot;yes&quot; to the second question, the answer to the first question doesn&#x27;t matter.

What you call short-sighted might be necessary for a longer-term strategy.  Long-term strategies are great, but sometimes $10 now is more important than $100 next week.

If you have 5 jobs in 10 years, that&#x27;s 5 periods (about 6-9 months) of being &quot;the new guy&quot; and (a) performing at a suboptimal level, because you&#x27;re learning idiosyncratic details of a closed-source tech stack, and (b) being unlikely to get useful projects because, no matter how good you are, every organization&#x27;s going to put new people through a dues-paying period. That ends up taking 3-4 years out of your career, time essentially wasted on learning parochial details of internal codebases rather than getting better at the craft in general. Not fun.<p>Engineers move around so much because they have to, not because they want to. Wages are too low relative to housing costs, and advancement is often political, and interesting projects are too thin on the ground because engineer-driven companies are a rarity.",1395847984

The PS4 (and most modern gaming rigs) don&#x27;t have the ability to run Crysis 3, at max settings, across two 1080p displays, sure.<p>But it isn&#x27;t Crysis 3 on max or the highway. There is a lot of middle ground to be had. Naturally, even most PCs today can&#x27;t run Crysis 3 on max and maintain 60fps, unless we&#x27;re talking purpose-built high-end gaming rigs.<p>The two big things you can&#x27;t lose in VR is latency and framerate, without these two factors the whole experience just sucks profoundly. The resolution is more negotiable.<p>The problem with the Oculus DK1 and its low-res screen isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s low-res, it&#x27;s that it has huge pixels, and the gap between each pixel on the LCD is plainly visible to the user. This is the infamous &quot;screen door&quot;. A higher density/resolution screen that&#x27;s upscaling from a lower-resolution signal would not suffer from the screen door effect. Upscaling is totally a viable option.<p>Beyond that, the PS4 absolutely has the ability to push 2x1080px60Hz, it just can&#x27;t do it with enormously complex graphics. This may mean we&#x27;ll have to settle for stylized graphics instead of photo-real, but such is the reality of ultra high-res gaming in 2014 (whether it&#x27;s a single 4K screen or multiple combined smaller screens).<p>Let&#x27;s be honest, if the base requirement for effective VR experiences was a quad-core with SLI GTX TITANs, the Oculus Rift would&#x27;ve made a loud thump in the market as it hit the ground. To stand any real chance at success Oculus, and everyone else, has to include &quot;mid level gaming PCs&quot; in its target demographic, whether it comes in the form of an Xbox One, a PS4, or a Windows PC.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m very disappointed that Oculus got acquired by Facebook, but Sony&#x27;s product is far from DOA, especially not on account of the PS4&#x27;s graphical horsepower.",1395847937

Here&#x27;s what he had:<p>-If he mentions that someone is bothering him, that person is removed from his presence.  (Charles wasn&#x27;t even aware that this was happening for the first five years of his tenure as CEO--his wife pointed it out to him.)<p>-There are people who prepare him and make him look good in every conversation.  If he doesn&#x27;t know the answer to a question, he says, &quot;I&#x27;ll get back to you.&quot;  Someone else writes the question down and a thoughtful, well-formulated answer appears on his desk the next morning.<p>-A medical plan that includes a 24/7 on-call doctor.  The doctors in his plan specifically take very few patients so Charles and his family can get appointments almost immediately.<p>-If there&#x27;s a line or waiting list, he is ushered around the line or someone waits in line on his behalf.  Charles literally never waited in line for anything for 15 years.<p>Charles was thoughtful and empathetic and was lucky to have a wife who kept him grounded.

Most notably, the policy of requiring mobile numbers to be tied to accounts, if you want to create/upgrade an app with write/write-DM permissions. The whole thread is full of developers citing their problems with the change and specially the new requirement of tying-in mobile numbers to accounts for upgraded permissions.<p>To be honest, I find it absurd as well.<p>1. What happens to teams of developers developing apps for a client?<p>2. What happens to a developer who creates different apps under a separate accounts? Does that mean the developer can&#x27;t have more than twitter accounts than mobile numbers at any given time?<p>3. Finally, what is the purpose of tying a mobile number to a twitter account? Wouldn&#x27;t it be smarter to allow developers to associate the same number to multiple accounts?<p>Here, in India, Twitter has short-codes for only THREE carriers in the entire country. If you have a number not belonging to any of these three carriers, you have to use a long-code (read international number) which is a one-way channel - i.e. you send the text but you don&#x27;t get a response - you are flying blind and that too with international texts!!<p>Well, the long-codes do not work and the short-codes aren&#x27;t an option for me, since I have the wrong carrier.<p>Add to that, twitter&#x27;s support isn&#x27;t very responsive.

Start with consulting. These engagements are different than employment because often times they&#x27;re not full-time and you can stagger a couple of contracts together at the same time. This is to your advantage because you now have two &quot;bosses&quot; (clients) instead of one. I know it sounds counterintuitive that more bosses are better, but if things aren&#x27;t going as you&#x27;d like on one contract, you can move on to another contract as it becomes available without the sort of risk you incur when you&#x27;re switching full-time employment at one company to another.<p>From there, you can further increase your independence by building a product that has many smaller customers.

There&#x27;s a lot of &quot;CSRF&quot; implementations out there, where the scare quotes are part of how I&#x27;m naming them. There&#x27;s headers to avoid clickjacking, which you really ought to default to the strongest protection level and make the user explicitly loosen if they need it.

However, I am not convinced that a law banning this practice will not make things worse for most people.<p>A cartel involves an arrangement where members REFUSE TO OFFER a better deal than the others - a pricefixing arrangement. On the other hand, this is very clearly about not going blatantly on each other&#x27;s turf to solicit / poach.<p>Consider this ... how did Apple find out about this? Was the employee called during work hours?<p>How come recruiters - internal HR or external agencies - can be instructed to not advertise job openings in venues like porn sites, but - it seems from all this outrage - cannot be instructed to not advertise on their competitors&#x27; websites?<p>Why can&#x27;t companies decide that the cost of reprisals for poaching key members is too high, independently and internally, before agreeing not to do it?<p>To sum up - I do not see this as a cartel AS LONG AS neither company turns away candidates who applied on their own, based on a mutual agreement. To be fair, Google did have such a policy and to the extent that this policy existed, that WAS a cartel. But NOT if the agreement is limited to not advertising offers to each other&#x27;s key employees. Those employees can easily find out job openings and average salaries just like everyone else can.<p>If you are going to make the argument that recruiters calling certain key employees of the other company to lure them away will give the majority of employees a better sense of how much they are worth and everyone&#x27;s salary if going to go up, you&#x27;ll have to work pretty hard to show the connection. Poaching key members of a team (e.g. to sabotage a competitor&#x27;s project) seems to mostly benefit those key members. It increases the cost for everyone else including the companies involved. And that cost is very likely to be passed on to the other employees. You would also have to show that the companies will always choose not to pass on the cost of poaching to their employees -- because otherwise, you will have to admit that LESS poaching might actually lead to LARGER salaries. And in fact, the data seems to show this. (Once again, by poaching I mean reaching out and specifically cold calling key people in rival companies to advertise positions that they could have found on their own.)<p>UPDATE: In fact, in many states the poaching itself of key members can be illegal.

As  programmers we expect our employers to empathize with our work, it&#x27;s only fair that you show the same empathy back to your employers.

Supporting x2 1080p screens (or above) requires serious graphical horsepower as you can imagine.<p>The PS4 has nowhere near that ability for graphics. I saw a comment saying the &quot;PS4 is a mid level gaming PC&quot;, so do you think that the PS4 will deliver the jaw dropping visuals and immersion required to blow away consumers on their first VR experience and change gaming forever?<p>I suspect the PS4 might only be capable of supporting x2 720p screens (based on what I&#x27;ve read about the PS4), which would deliver a hugely compromised vision of what VR <i>could</i> be compared to what Oculus&#x27; original vision was/is. It would be even more disappointing if Sony had a compromised product that made loads of money, as this would send the signal to VR companies that it&#x27;s ok to not shoot for the stars with a consumer VR product.<p>Oculus stated all along that they wont release consumer product until its ready, which was credible as they had to answer to no one (except if you count the hopes and dreams of backers that had no equity, and VCs that bought into their vision.) Now there is huge uncertainty with this bolt from the blue acquisition.<p>People here defending Facebook are comparing the acquisition to Instagram and WhatsApp. Those companies may have a lot of users, but they don&#x27;t fundamentally promise to make a massive leap forward into a virtual universe, a kind of a leap forward not seen since Carmack implemented 3D graphics in the original Doom. No nerds here give a fuck about photo sharing with filters, or SMS over the web. Those aren&#x27;t exciting leaps, they can be cloned easily, there aren&#x27;t the same technical challenges to be overcome. Facebook is welcome to buy those types of companies. VR, however, with the team Oculus has, had the potential to do something great, with zero compromises or outside pressure.

Also, the nature of the agreement is far too broad and the companies involved is far too numerous for them to argue in good faith that their intent was much more narrow.<p>I completely agree that they overstepped and should be held liable, but some of the outrage seems misguided.  The HR executive involved, for instance, may or may not be in position to know that the policy is part of an illegal scheme and the fired employee certainly was not.  Also, unless you&#x27;re one of the star programmers who were highly in demand, it&#x27;s quite unlikely that your salary was all that depressed over this.  If anything, the impact may have been slightly positive for average employees - at a lot of places, superstars aren&#x27;t necessarily substitutes for average employees, but rather complements and lowering prices of superstars can boost rather than depress wages of average employees:<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html</a><p>On the whole, this is kind of the replay of the Microsoft anti-trust trials.  Bundling web browsers with operating systems is not illegal - the illegal part was the context in which such action occurred.  It was seen as an abuse of market power.  Sports leagues openly collude on this kind of stuff without most people caring at all or pointing fingers at those involved.  Government can have strong interest in such matters in the interest of encouraging a healthier market - though political and career motivations of lawyers/prosecutors involved also play a large part - but to seeing this as a clear morality play is not wise.<p>Edit: actually this covers the legal issues better:<p><a href=""http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/258600/Antitrust+Competition/How+to+Legally+Keep+Competitors+from+Poaching+Your+Key+Employees+Antitrust+Law+and+NonPoachingNonSolicitation+Agreements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/258600/Antitrust+Compet...</a><p>Assuming the article is correct, having a general agreement without any specific, legitimate purpose is illegal, but on a limited basic it can be legal.  Still it seems far-fetched to assume that the HR executive in question had to know that such an illegal agreement existed, because for all he knows, a much more limited, legal contract could have existed due to their partnership and Google may have had a broader policy to ensure easy compliance.  We now know that that&#x27;s not the case, but I don&#x27;t know why we can assume that the HR executive necessarily was aware of all this.",1395846500

For starters, the search space is nondeterministic, and since you can only explore in one direction, you&#x27;re not really performing a search space exploration as much as choosing a direction and going with it.<p>Secondly, the implementation doesn&#x27;t perform the combination of current state score and proposed state score that lies at the heart of the A* algorithm. Instead it takes the current state for granted (which, again, it must given the inability to backtrack) and chooses the available move with the largest score.<p>Thirdly, and I&#x27;m reaching a little here, I can&#x27;t find any place where any heuristic is used to optimize search performance by pruning the search tree. The search space is brute forced on each iteration, and the entire tree is scored.<p>At the expense of seeming pedantic I suggest this is a greedy play algorithm rather than A*. You can be even more precise and call it a single-ply minimax.<p>Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, I should temper my criticism with the fact that this implementation works.

Laziness is great in places, allows you to write very declaratively, and even allows for some computations that would otherwise be impossible or less efficient. However, <i>most</i> of the time, you envision and write code as a series of steps (even though theoretically in a functional language, you&#x27;re just writing an expression). In a practical matter, the cases in which lazy evaluation becomes desirable exist, but are limited. <i>Most</i> of the time, you want, and expect when you write it, your code to be evaluated strictly. Of course you can enforce strictness manually with `seq` and bang notations and the like, but this clutters up your code and might not even matter if you&#x27;re using library code which doesn&#x27;t do the same. IMO Haskell would <i>greatly</i> served by having laziness be opt-in, not opt-out.

PHP only shows its merits after a while, and through good practices.<p>However, looking at the charts over at langpop.com, I don&#x27;t see how people would choose PHP over perl for its easiness, given the wide difference of popularity.

Using strictness in haskell is very simple, and knowing when you need to is very easy to learn.  The profiling tools make it incredibly obvious when laziness is causing a problem.

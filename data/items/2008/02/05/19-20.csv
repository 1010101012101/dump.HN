109866,comment,109683,109683,0,0,jmtulloss,,,"I prototyped something like this recently and enjoyed it quite a bit, so I'm glad somebody else has tried to make it into a business. I, for one, am a bit skeptical for a few reasons.<p>1. The barrier to entry is pretty high. In a world dominated by web apps, who wants to try a heavyweight Java app that might take a full 2 minutes to get set up? We live in a 30 second world these days.<p>2. Home routers are messy. People who aren't tech savvy aren't going to want to mess around with opening ports. UPnP helps this, but I've found that it's unreliable on many popular, low quality routers. Users who download the app and then find that it doesn't work oftentimes will just give up instead of diving into the router.<p>Of course, maybe I'm underestimating how much the average consumer can get done these days. It'll be interesting to see what kind of coverage this gets, especially since I'm working on an app that approaches the problem more in the style of Anywhere.FM.",1202241556
109865,comment,109802,109802,0,0,jimm,,,"I learn by doing, like abstractbill does.<p>One thing I've come to understand: you only learn when you are asking questions. Reading a book doesn't put you in the frame of mind where you're asking questions. You are being spoon-fed information, sometimes before you know why you need it. The information might be useful or vital, but if you don't know you need it or why you need it then it won't stick.",1202241388

109860,comment,109584,109613,0,0,xirium,,,"HFS has some cruft from pre-Unix implementations. However, this cruft allows you use the filing system on older versions of MocOS. HFS implements swap space as a hidden file. HFS+ implements journalling in same way. If you boot an older version of MocOS then you temporarily lose journalling. This is the behaviour that you'd want. However, some bits are messy, including directory seperators, Unicode file names, file forks and instant indexing of file names.",1202241220

109858,comment,109802,109802,0,0,benmathes,,,"Like many other people here I learn in an evolutionary manner. I dive in, get something working, reflect, notice pattern(s), try and get more working, recurse. However, I tend to like to seed my evolutionary exploring with some canonical knowledge first.<p>For example: When I was learning Perl, I first read about ""make repetitive tasks easy"", ""good text processing"", and then got hacking. When I was learning Lisp I read about macros, recursion, list-processing, and then got hacking.",1202240783
109857,comment,109802,109802,0,0,sabat,,,"I'll go out on a limb and suggest that reading something in order to learn it will always fail: you're trying to understand something exactly the way someone else does, and that's impossible.<p>Also, learning is like birth and death: there might be other people in the room, but you do it alone. Learning is an experience, not the result of reading something. You can understand what you read, but understanding an idea != learning.",1202240483

I'd phrase it like (""Explain an interesting technical concept to me - your choice"").

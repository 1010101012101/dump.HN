I was pointing out the irony of HN user enupten&#x27;s criticism of the lawyer deposing Gates, while knowing little about being a lawyer. My remark relies upon my assumption that enupten is more likely to be some sort of a techie than a lawyer (and not both).<p>OTOH, you can&#x27;t possibly accept MS&#x27; weak argument that their hands were forced by engineering decisions, rather than engaging in illegal anti-competitive business practices for the sake of harming their competitors.

The KDE UX is like kryptonite to me. I feel like a senile old lady when I use it, unable to grasp what the hell is going on.<p>I briefly tried KDE again when GNOME 2 was killed, and I uncomfortably went back to GNOME. I deeply disliked GNOME 3, but at least I found it usable. (I eventually switched to XFCE).<p>I know KDE is a mature, large, beautiful project, but ultimately a desktop environment is about user experience, and KDE&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t click with me. I&#x27;m aware my experience is entirely subjective, but I suspect there are others like me who just can&#x27;t get used to the K. So we end up in GNOME, and by inertia resort to using and developing GTK applications.<p>I think it&#x27;d be very cool if there was something like XFCE for Qt. Maybe LXQt will play this role in the future.",1414410799
8514946,comment,8514398,8514678,0,0,exDM69,,,"In my opinion, it might be related to Qt being a huge framework and ecosystem where GTK is &quot;just&quot; a GUI toolkit.<p>I don&#x27;t know if things have changed recently but at Qt at least used to require custom C++ extensions. This requires you to use custom toolchains or the recommended way of using the Qt Creator IDE. This isn&#x27;t necessarily bad (I&#x27;ve only quickly tried it out, I don&#x27;t really know) but it certainly makes me look at other alternatives first.<p>This isn&#x27;t perhaps a big problem if you use other languages than C++ and there are decent wrappers available. But having to use a custom compiler/preprocessor just to get a GUI up isn&#x27;t what I really want.<p>Qt is a pretty intrusive framework and ecosystem, where you have QStrings and QSockets and QEverything. GTK is perhaps a bit more lean and mean library than a full ecosystem.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed that Qt applications do not work very well over remote X connection over slow networks. Apps built with other GUI toolkits work much more fluently. (I understand that this is not very common these days but I still do work on remote X on a daily basis).<p>I am sure that the Qt frameworks solve practical problems in cross platform development, but I&#x27;d rather not get involved in a whole ecosystem when all I need is a GUI toolkit.",1414410774

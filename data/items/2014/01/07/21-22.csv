Even simultaneously with the near unanimous votes to block funding for closing Guatanamo, you see many of the Democrats who voted to block funding saying that they supported closing Guatanamo and would vote for it given a <i>specific</i> closure plan that addressed security concerns.<p>I think the gaps <i>always</i> been there, but a very specific event threw a monkey wrench in the political viability of the Democrats pursuing what was clearly their preference all along.",1389131976

7020277,comment,7019914,7019914,141,0,redhatstory,,,"In the beginning, there was Red Hat Linux[1]. It was sold in boxes at stores such as CompUSA (remember?) but was also available for free download from Red Hat.<p>Then, Red Hat decided they could make more money by spinning off Red Hat Linux into a separate enterprise-only product called Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), which they declined to make available for free in a ready-to-install binary form. Fedora[2] was also spun off at this time, as the free successor to Red Hat Linux that was supposed to be only suitable for home users. Fedora development was/is sponsored by Red Hat but they did not offer end-user support, in contrast to RHEL.<p>Meanwhile, there was demand for a free version of RHEL. Since it was built with GPL software, Red Hat was obligated to make it available in source form, but their trademark policy prohibited anyone else from using the Red Hat name. Therefore, a group of volunteers took RHEL, removed Red Hat trademarks, and called it CentOS. To avoid confusion, CentOS explained the origins of the distribution on their web site. For their efforts, they were threatened by Red Hat&#x27;s legal department and forced to remove all mentions of Red Hat and even links to Red Hat&#x27;s web site from the CentOS web site. CentOS complied and began referring to its Red Hat derivations using the euphemism PNAELV[3].<p>Now, Red Hat has again decided they would benefit from being more directly involved in providing an open-source, freely-available enterprise Linux distribution. We&#x27;ve come full circle.<p>(Flippant depiction aside, I intend no antagonism, but merely find the history of these projects interesting.)<p>[1]: <a href""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linu"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux</a>\n[2]: <a href""https://fedoraproject.org/en/about-fedor"" rel""nofollo"">https://fedoraproject.org/en/about-fedora</a>\n[3]: <a href""http://www.pnaelv.ne"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.pnaelv.net</a>",1389131805

That changes depending on what sort of beastly hardware you are willing to throw at your version control team.<p>>Git of course hits a brick wall much sooner, somewhere around single-digit gigabytes of data (depending heavily on the average size of every object in the DAG), even ignoring throughput.<p>if you use Git the same way you&#x27;d use Perforce or Mercurial - one central server handling everything ... you&#x27;d better stay with Perforce or Mercurial.

7020240,comment,7019673,7019880,29,0,yonran,,,"I worked at Google (in a team using Perforce) and now work at a different company that uses multiple interdependent projects using Maven. Using a single monolithic codebase along with a build tool that statically builds everything at trunk has its advantages:<p>* You immediately get improvements from upstream projects without having to get them manually.<p>* You can unambiguously answer the question, What code am I using? with a single number. With multiple repositories, you have to list all the versions of each project that you are using.<p>* Easy API refactoring. You don’t have to worry about coordinating version number bumps across different repositories/dependency manifests when you make major changes to inter-project APIs. With a monolithic repository, you fix all callers of an API using a single code commit. No need to edit the version numbers in your pom files.<p>* Low cost to split a project into multiple separate projects. With multiple repositories or version numbers, you are reluctant to create new projects because the APIs will forever be harder to refactor (since you will have to worry about version numbers).<p>* No diamond dependency problem of 2 dependencies using a different version of a base project. Everyone is using the same version of base.<p>With a monolithic repository+build system, upstream callers are responsible to never make a commit that breaks downstream callers. I feel like it’s similar to the question of optimal currency areas. If your organization is growing in lock-step, then you can all happily share a single gold-standard repository with little friction. But if you can’t trust your upstream projects, you introduce versioning between the projects and have to deal with the mental burden of wondering whether to upgrade to the newest upstream project and whether you’re actually running the latest code.<p>Edit: added a couple more.",1389131462

Even at our current scale, we often make large changes throughout our code base, and having a single repository is useful for continuous modernization. Splitting it up would make large, atomic refactorings more difficult. On top of that, the idea that the scaling constraints of our source control system should dictate our code structure just doesn&#x27;t sit well with us.&quot;<p>I remember reading about their Git troubles awhile ago, and I still don&#x27;t buy this argument that it is better to have one large repository.

Increase your Facebook likes by having Facebook WiFi available to your customers, and therefore, get more traffic through the door as Facebook recommends your business to their friends.<p>Also, you should be able to get some kind of analytic data back from Facebook. They should be able to show you that 75% of your WiFi users are female, 18-35, or that your customers change based on time, or day of the week. Therefore, if you know younger people drink more cappuccinos, and they come in more often at noon, you can put that drink front and center. Sure, you could do this without Facebook, but it&#x27;s logging who&#x27;s in your store for you, so no extra work on your part.<p>This is even better for Facebook. Oh look, John likes to login to this coffee place, maybe we can recommend coffee ads to him. Or, more importantly, why don&#x27;t we allow competing coffee shops to bid on customers using their main competitor? Think about that. There&#x27;s a Starbucks across the street from your cafe. If you can advertise directly to people that use that Starbucks, that&#x27;s a dream, and you&#x27;d pay a premium.<p>Or hey, Steve (male, 35, employed, based on his Facebook profile) was just hanging out in this Honda dealership.

7020054,comment,7018819,7018819,12,0,eldude,,,"The problem with discussions of promises vs ... is there&#x27;s usually a great deal of misunderstanding about what problem promises are solving: enforcement of the callback contract. I could go on for hours about the subtleties in the conversation, but the gist of it boils down to this:<p><pre><code>    Node callbacks have a strict but entirely unenforced (in userland) contract:\n</code></pre>\nThe contract:<p><pre><code>    * Callbacks should be called OAOO\n\n    * Never throw (explicitly or implicitly) after origin tick (aka pass post-tick errors to callback)\n</code></pre>\nThere is also an increasingly common informal contract:<p><pre><code>    * Never throw ever (aka pass ALL errors to the callback)\n</code></pre>\nBut there are a couple of issues that get in the way of successful enforcement of this contract:<p><pre><code>    * When external libraries violate this contract (library A calls library B,\n      but library B violates the contract in a way that makes it difficult for\n      library A to easily maintain the contract)\n\n    * Asynchronous errors\n\n    * Crash-worthy exceptions\n</code></pre>\nInevitably, this all continually comes back to error handling over and over again, with the core issue being that node.js has 2 divergent methods for error handling: exceptions (try/catch/throw) and error passing (callback(err)). Exceptions requires opt-in error handling (crash by default) while error passing requires opt-out error handling (crash on demand) &quot;and never the twain shall meet.&quot;<p>Promises attempt to resolve this by coercing all exceptions to error passing, but not all exceptions are safe to be passed. Specifically, any exception originating from core that is not an invalid argument exception (think 4XX vs 5XX class errors) cannot safely be caught / coerced / continued on. Also, not all errors passed to callbacks are even theoretically passable as the unofficial policy of core is that core callback errors are only distinguishable from exceptions in that they occur after the origin tick. In other words, they are equally crash-worthy and equally non-crash-worthy.<p>So promises are an improvement because when used pervasively, they enforce the formal and informal callback contracts, while providing a continuable-like representation of the value that can be passed around.<p><i></i>This benefit of contract enforcement is entirely independent of the specific API implementations.<i></i><p>The stepup[1] library trivially accomplishes contract enforcement by integrating the async trycatch[2] module without using promises or requiring pervasive usage. I&#x27;ve used them both for years now in various professional projects, with trycatch in use here at LinkedIn. Additionally, stepup could easily return a continuable to support a passable value representation.<p>Async generators will solve most of this though, allowing node.js to ditch the error passing for exception handling, but since Error subclassing and typed catches are basically not supported in node.js the language keeps getting in the way of a satisfactory complete solution. This is a whole other discussion.<p>In conclusion, error handling in node.js is an undesigned mess of which the core contributors don&#x27;t even seem to fully understand or be aware[3,4]. FWIW, node.js&#x27; crash on error design is a DoS liability, which spion addresses in the article, and which LinkedIn uses trycatch to avoid.<p>[1] <a href""https://npmjs.org/package/stepu"" rel""nofollo"">https://npmjs.org/package/stepup</a><p>[2] <a href""https://npmjs.org/package/trycatc"" rel""nofollo"">https://npmjs.org/package/trycatch</a><p>[3] <a href""https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/511"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5114</a><p>[4] <a href""https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/514"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5149</a>",1389129886

7020015,comment,7019673,7019673,50,0,Crito,,,"I wrote a comment about the scaling of repositories (and specifically Facebook&#x27;s issues) a few days ago that was wiped out by the HN crash, but I&#x27;ve managed to recover it from HNSearch:<p><i><old-comment></i>\nFacebook&#x27;s problem is that they were trying to scale with Git improperly. With conventional CVS[sic] systems like Perforce, you can scale a single repo nearly as large as any company will need. Emphasis on that nearly. At a certain point, with a large enough codebase (and, critically, enough throughput) you start to realize that you are about to hit a brick wall. With perforce, this starts to manifest with service brownouts.<p>With perforce, you can reasonably expect to run into this brick wall somewhere in the neighborhood of terabytes of metadata and dozens of transactions per second. That changes depending on what sort of beastly hardware you are willing to throw at your version control team.<p>Git of course hits a brick wall much sooner, somewhere around single-digit gigabytes of data (depending heavily on the average size of every object in the DAG), even ignoring throughput.<p>Perforce is probably good enough for Facebook in the present, but if you are a company that large and if you are forward looking, it becomes apparent that with existing version control technology, &quot;one repo per company&quot; is not a long term solution. Even &quot;one repo per department&quot;.<p>You can split it even further, but what you realize is that you are developing infrastructure that allows you to use many repos (for instance your build servers and internal code search/browsing tools will now need to understand that concept) but you are losing many of the benefits of Perforce. While you are in the process of adapting your infrastructure to wrap its mind around many repositories, it makes sense to allow dev teams to really take advantage of this splitting. Develop infrastructure that allows Perforce and git repos to coexist in the company, allowing dev teams to spin up new git repos for their every project at will. Done properly, git allows you to create massively scalable systems that you can count on supporting your companies needs for the foreseeable future.<p>Smooth migration, migration that does not disrupt development, takes months (assuming the right initial conditions), so it is best to recognize the problem and start early, before service becomes disrupted.<p>If I understand Facebook&#x27;s situation currently, they are still in the &quot;try to make Mercurial scale&quot; stage of denial, burning developer time and effort to push back that first brick wall (the same one that git hits, though mercurial hits it after git hits it but before perforce hits it...)<p>Here is a google presentation about extreme scaling with Perforce: <a href""http://www.perforce.com/sites/default/files/still-all-one-server-perforce-scale.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.perforce.com/sites/default/files/still-all-one-se...</a><p>An example of building multi-repo infrastructure for large projects with git is Android&#x27;s repo: <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repo_(script"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repo_(script)</a> Repo is just one example though; other, better, solutions are very possible.<p><i></old-comment></i><p>I guess the TL;DR here is that I think it is great that Facebook is making a single Mercurial repository work for their purposes right now, but I think they are kidding themselves if they think that is a long term solution.  They are doing a pretty good job of making Mercurial scale like Perforce can scale, but that will only work for them for so long.<p>(In the above comment I talk about building a scalable system <i>with</i> git <i>(&quot;with&quot; git, rather than making git itself scale)</i>, but the same can of course be done with mercurial instead of git.  I don&#x27;t mean this to be a comment suggesting that they should use git instead of mercurial.)",1389129541

The language cannot and is not meant to protect you from yourself.<p>No, you don&#x27;t need to do evil things at all. Any C api that returns a pointer which you then need to pass to a C++ function that takes a reference is a possible source of failure if you forget to check your pointer. It can happen quite easily by mistake. The language cannot in any way guarantee that you won&#x27;t make a reference from a null pointer. At least taking a reference as an argument does at least alert people that you&#x27;re not expecting to be passed a null as an argument to your function.",1389128741

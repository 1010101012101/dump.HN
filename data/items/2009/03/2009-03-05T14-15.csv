It might be a few thousand in lawyer fees, but that might be well worth it, especially if a few key founders need H1-B. Since more than 50% start-ups had some immigrant founders, I'm assuming that a large part of them had H1-B rather than some other visa or green card.",1236265149
504283,comment,504188,504276,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Agreed. As a Canadian I sometimes bemoan the fact that startup culture is almost non-existent in this country, and that legally I have no realistic way of participating in an American startup, ever. But them's the cards I've been dealt I suppose.<p>There is always the TN visa, which is quota-less and hinges only on an existing offer from a company, so I suppose I <i>could</i> work for a startup. The TN, though, is not on a track to a green card.",1236265132

The RIAA Curve (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_equalization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_equalization</a>) has been around since 1954.  Before that there was an assortment of different compression strategies used by different record-player manufacturers.  In the 1930s records made by one company often wouldn't sound correct on record players made by another company.  The RIAA standardized this.  Perhaps a more surprising note for the 1975 list would be ""And the RIAA made contributions to the industry which benefitted consumers.""",1236264607

504276,comment,504188,504251,0,0,goodgoblin,,,"Another problem with H1-B is that any coworker you meet who is here on H1-B cannot actually get involved in your startup, if you decide to leave that company or work on it on the side.  This actually stifles innovation.  I worked with a couple of very bright H1-B coworkers who I become pretty good friends with, and even though they had the time and the inclination to work with me on a startup, they couldn't b/c doing so would endanger their visa status.  We consulted a lawyer who told us that even coming over to make coffee on a regular basis could be construed as contributing.<p>If I had worked closely with people who could actually branch out and work elsewhere that would have definitely accelerated my project, but instead, though I value the friendships I've made, the acceleration to the economy via H1-B only occurs in terms of the work large companies can do.<p>Startups can't  afford to sponsor H1-B and H1-B's cannot start their own companies.",1236264485

504251,comment,504188,504198,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I've always thought that the H-1B system should be entirely scrapped in favor of an actual skill-based immigration policy. My parents were able to come to Canada years ago based on their education and skills in the tech sector. We had a defined path between landing and citizenship (only takes 3 years) which only made it more attractive. My father is now gainfully employed at over twice the Canadian income average, and my mother has started her own business that has contributed significantly back into the economy. It's a win win for everyone.<p>If the US is serious about recruiting top talent from the around the world they'd be wise to get on a similar bandwagon. Part of the H-1B problem is the abuse that's so prevalent, since an employee is essentially at a mercy of an  employer until he/she gets the green card, which takes, in cases, up to a decade.

I was thrown off by the word ""unacceptable,"" because it often implies the existence of a mutual negotiation that may not be the case.<p>But moving along briskly, developing for a proprietary platform carries with it a huge risk of getting burned some day, but perhaps the question is whether you will make enough money beforehand to make the eventual burn worthwhile.<p>I would be surprised if there's ANYTHING Apple would put in that document that would get a lot of developers to change their minds. Many developers won't sharecrop the Apple orchard under any circumstances consistent with Apple's business plan, and many developers will take their chances and try to make money.<p>I take it you think there are some policies Apple could adopt that would sway you? And you think these policies are consistent with APple's direction but they haven't done it yet??",1284062382

Nickpp touched on this with his AltaVista comment, but giving up this early in the game is not only stupid but is not going to happen: The market is too young and too rich to not explore.<p>Facebook may be a behemoth today as Yahoo was before Google. But Google innovated the shit out of one niche part of what Yahoo was doing and cornered the market, later taking over most of the parts that Yahoo sacrificed search to be good at. In the same vein, I have no doubt that there is going to be a replacement for Facebook -- it might not be a social playground or an explicit network, it could be an online reputation or identity platform, it could be a standardization of personal and social data -- but Facebook, like all things, will fade, change and eventually be considered antiquated.",1284062337

Some experiments indicate that people use rationality to explain things they did, for example under hypnosis they suggest you should open your umbrella at a party, then you do it and try to explain why.<p>In this case rationality is a false distortion of what is going on. Living and thinking is at a higher level that rationality.  We can use computers, logic, maths and rules to improve our rational mind, but thinking is much more that rational thinking. Creativity and emotions play a vital role. Destroy emotions and you loose your memory (citation required), because memorizing is linked to attention and attention is linked to emotions and feeling.<p>As a mathematician I can prove a theorem and give a prove, but there is something creative in finding a proof.

The other three bakers are competing perhaps at extreme levels already, whether through branding, building a loyal customer base by providing better customer service, better products, a nice environment, friendly bakers, and price certainly.<p>Now, if you, the new kid on the block, enter this highly competitive market, you need to be extremely clever to be competing while not loosing money and, if so you manage to compete, they would probably copy you before they die themselves.<p>If however you decide to take a little bit more time upfront and invest more effort to find a place where your service is needed and there is little competition, you'll be making healthy profits.

A few years ago me and my girlfriend drove a 2001 Honda Insight 1040 miles on one 12 gallon tank.  (85mpg - fully loaded with luggage + nasty traffic.)  In the Tour De Sol rally, we got 94mpg.  Keep in mind it is a stock car and there was a lot of weight we could have removed.  (AC, second person, interior, hybrid parts, spare tire, air bags, glass, etc.)  We also only came in second place.<p>The car is truly light (1850 lbs), but weight mostly affects rolling resistance (unless you hit brakes).  With a lighter car, you can use a smaller engine.  Though, around the same time I drove an 80s sedan with a v8 engine several hundred miles on the open road and got 40 mpg.  It was so loaded down I mostly drove 50-55mph.<p>For open roads, aerodynamics is everything.  80% of the energy is spent moving the wind at highway speeds.  Even hills aren't a problem (they store energy like batteries).  Perhaps cars could look more like airplanes?  Then we could go 80mph and still get good mpg.<p>Also, I find it curious that you need to modify a car to make it ""safe"" for use on a race track.  They have insurance policies that require cages, fire suppression, rigid seats, 6 point belts, air bags removed, etc.  They still tend to be quite light.",1284062014

8026152,comment,8026116,8026116,5,0,smacktoward,,,"As someone who used to develop on Scoop as part of my day job, I would say: probably not.<p>The problem is twofold. First, Scoop doesn&#x27;t really do anything anymore that other software can&#x27;t do as well. Its killer feature was user diaries, which allowed user-generated content in an age when most systems didn&#x27;t. But those days are long past now, so just supporting UGC in a semi-elegant way doesn&#x27;t attract people by itself the way it used to in, say, 2004.<p>Second, as you indicate, it&#x27;s accrued an absolutely shocking amount of technical debt, mostly from many years of neglect. This makes switching to another system less off-putting than it normally would be, since if you stick with Scoop you&#x27;re going to be doing as much or more work bringing and keeping it up to date as you would by making a switch to an alternative product. And at least if you make a switch you get ongoing support and modern features.<p>So, anything&#x27;s possible, but given these two factors I have a feeling that if someone were going to step forward to save Scoop, they would have done it by now. The fact that nobody has implies that the audience of people interested in running it on modern systems is tiny at best.<p>So if I was still running a site on Scoop, I&#x27;d spend my time looking for good alternatives and planning how to get moved onto one rather than looking around for someone to bail out a ship that has more or less already sunk.",1405209514

He also didn&#x27;t make any truly ridiculous leaps of plausibility that the ancient astronauts theory requires. Hyperdiffusionism doesn&#x27;t have any adherents today because there wasn&#x27;t enough evidence to sustain it, and inside the confines of the scientific method Heyerdahl was not a scientist.

All reading and writing operations that treat the tree as simply an expanse of RAM are O(log n), vs. O(1) of direct RAM access. Therefore, pure functional programs can simulate any impure algorithm with a slowdown <i>no worse than</i> a log n factor.<p>Again, let me emphasize this is a <i>worst-case</i> analysis. Many common algorithms are equivalent regardless, and that&#x27;s part of the reason tel specifically names Union/Find as such an algorithm, as it&#x27;s actually somewhat rare to encounter one where there isn&#x27;t a Big-O equivalent algorithm that is pure. Pure functional algorithms often require some modestly clever amortization to get there, but that&#x27;s perfectly valid both in theory and in practice (many beloved &quot;imperative&quot; structures have amortized complexities, too, including such basics as a hash table).<p>In practice pure functional can sometimes come with larger constants; whether they hit you in practice depends on your use case and, often, sensitivity to garbage collection pauses.<p>In light of all that, I think it would be  fair to say that your question is somewhat ill-defined. You can really only compare particular algorithms against each other, because there&#x27;s no trivial equivalence between &quot;imperative&quot; and &quot;pure functional&quot; algorithms. Plus, the barrier between the two in practice is quite fungible... especially in a garbage-collected imperative language nothing stops you from using a &quot;functional&quot; algorithm, and every practical &quot;functional&quot; language will give you a way of running &quot;imperative&quot; algorithms directly. (Yes, even Haskell. But tel is building up to that. I won&#x27;t give it away yet. Stay tuned.)",1405207507

Sure, some would go, but even then, after a year or two they would want to return.<p>It has been a while since I have heard anything about floods of refugees wanting to leave Russia, so life there can&#x27;t be all that bad.<p>What&#x27;s to say that Snowden isn&#x27;t actually enjoying life in Russia? His C.V. is rather impeccable and I doubt he will be struggling for work. He is almost certainly not without his female admirers too. He might just get used to knowing that the U.S.A. is off limits. He might also be able to be relaxed about personal security. He knows that if anything happens to him then it is pretty bad news for Uncle Sam even if it is a lone nutter that does the deed.<p>Okay his asylum status runs out in less than a year but how much does he really value a U.S. passport? Or for charges to be dropped against him? It is not that big a deal. Uncle Sam has no leverage here even if Americans don&#x27;t see it that way.",1388667051

A lot of people who don&#x27;t like Snowden&#x27;s actions know as much about the situation as you do. They&#x27;ve just drawn different conclusions. The gap here is one of personal philosophy and opinion, not one of knowledge.<p>I&#x27;&#x27;m not entirely sure why Snowden is getting so much personal credit. I remember watching an episode of Frontline on PBS that discussed “Room 641A” [1]. A few quotes from the cited wikipedia page, emphasis added:<p>”[the room] is fed by fiber optic lines from beam splitters installed in fiber optic trunks carrying Internet backbone traffic and, as analyzed by J. Scott Marcus, a former CTO for GTE and a former adviser to the FCC, <i>has access to all Internet traffic that passes through the building</i>, and therefore <i>&#x27;the capability to enable surveillance and analysis of internet content on a massive scale</i>, including both overseas and purely domestic traffic.”<p>”[the program] was originally broadcast on <i>May 15, 2007</i>. It was also featured on PBS&#x27;s NOW on <i>March 14, 2008</i>. The room was also covered in the PBS Nova episode &#x27;The Spy Factory&#x27;.”<p>I admittedly watch more PBS than the average person. I was talking about Room 641A and concept of the NSA directly siphoning every call, email, text and url sent from the AT&T Pacific data center several years ago. Snowden’s revelations were news and he provided theretofore unnknown details. But they weren&#x27;t completely out of the blue.<p>People knew that the NSA was collecting data on an unprecedented scale before Edward Snowden. These programs aren’t new, they didn’t start last year. Snowden unquestioningly gets credit for coming forward, he deserves praise for taking such a risk. It’s clear that he provided us with a paper trail and evidence that no one had in May of 2007. But our knowledge of the NSA’s activities is not “entirely because of information provided to journalists by Edward Snowden” as the NYT OpEd alleges. People had the knowledge years ago. The outrage is recent.<p>We&#x27;ll see if the future holds substantive policy reforms or presidential pardons. Cautious optimism never hurts.<p>[1] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A</a>",1388665454

In Chicago, a state organization is trying to create a programable robot with LED lights to get kids interested in coding and putting together simple hardware hacks. I think that is a great idea. I think a programmable robot kids can create and control with an iphone app would be great as well (paint-by-numbers hardware + software hacking).<p>It is true that the more we lower the threshold, the more people will dabble with hacking. It may or may not produce more great hackers in the short run, but in the long run it will create a shared literacy that puts hacking higher on the priority list for parents and kids 10 years down the line. You don&#x27;t just share code, you share a value system when you teach that.",1388664918

Talking about an act is free speech, and should be protected even when we find the subject matter abhorrent â€” though speech approving of illegal acts walks a blurry line between free speech and criminal incitement. In fact, offensive speech is pretty much the only kind that <i>needs</i> protecting. Freedom of speech that only guards unobjectionable things is like Henry Ford's famous offering of freedom: ""Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.""",1289512539
1895449,comment,1895057,1895057,0,0,a_m_kelly,,,"If you find yourself to be interested in this sort of thing more broadly, in the justification of violence or it's utility, I recommend William T. Vollmann's exhaustive, intricate attempt to establish a framework for understanding the motivations, morals, and ethics of violence in his work Rising Up and Rising Down: Some thoughts on Violence, Freedom & Urgent Means.<p>To give some idea of what the text is like, here's a little bit of it from a section called ""Where Do My Rights End?"":<p><pre><code>   Justified Choices of the Self:
   1. Whether or not to violently defend itself against violence; 
   2. Whether or not to violently defend someone else from violence.
   3. Whether or not to destroy itself.
   4. Whether or not to help a weaker self destroy itself, to  save it from a worse fate.

   Conditions: 
   1. No attachment to nonviolent creeds. 
   2. No attachment to collectivity or authority which might prohibit the self from removing itself from ""the line of fire""
   Caveat to (1) and (2): So-called involunrtary attachments are not binding..."" (pg 81-82. Abbr. Edition)

   ...</code></pre>
The abridged edition from which I quote above is over 700 pages and includes case studies and narratives of people, nations or groups acting a certain way, which Vollmann slotting them into his ""Moral Calculus,"" I haven't had a chance to finish it yet but I remain interested in the elaborate thought experiment that is the book and the vividness of the historical anecdotes it contains.<p>Vollmann would fully support responding to violence in kind, there's a long section on non-violent movements and their utter hopelessness in the face of regimes unwilling (like bullies) to tolerate any dissent.<p>[The classic example of this is perhaps Harry Turteldove's story ""The Last Article,"" which proposes Ghandi campaigning in a Nazi occupied India and ends just as you would expect it to.]",1289512537
1895448,comment,1895057,1895419,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Yes, that is a problem. It is one reason I don't advise kids (that I talk to about such problems) to take this approach.<p>One thing I actually disliked about the post is the way he has de-humanised bullies. When in reality the correct approach is to feel sorry for them - because they have all manner of deep seated issues. Not in a lovey-dovey way (which, he is right, is silly) but in an adult comprehending way.<p>The act of your violence is a potential learning experience for them too. Too much vitriol and anger and they may come away harbouring deep resentment, and later come back at you with escalating violence. But a short sharp shock could teach them some important truths.<p>For the most part, the really bad bullies I suffered at school are already failures in adult life. With the one exception of another bully who also got beaten up (not by me) late in the school system - he was dramatically changed after that and is currently one of the nicest and most successful adults I know (although there were other factors swinging in his favour).<p>So sympathy, but not hippy-love. Violence, but not retribution.<p>It is a tough balance.",1289512498
1895447,comment,1895057,1895400,0,0,philwelch,,,"I was a bullied kid.<p>In middle school, teaching me to be less weird would have been pretty difficult. Teaching me to hit back--well, I didn't even have to be taught. Turned out hitting back stopped the bullying, and growing up stopped the weirdness (at least, I think it did).<p>Your advice is probably good for kids who are just unpopular and weird. Once the line is crossed into violence, though, it's a different class of problem. There are only two responses to violence: involve the authorities, or if the authorities aren't present or don't care, hit back. The situation in that respect is more like prison than like coaching a weird kid in social skills.<p>Culture of violence? That already exists as soon as kids are getting bullied. A culture of violence is only solved when adults in authority care enough to become involved. People don't physically bully each other at work because if you did, the police would take you to jail. People do physically bully each other in school and in prison because in both cases, the authorities don't care.",1289512445

1895445,comment,1895057,1895057,0,0,marcamillion,,,"Just to re-iterate many of the above comments. When I was in 7th grade (in Jamaica you are about 11 in 7th grade), I was perpetually bullied by one guy. Another 7th grader, but because I came from a middle class upbringing and he from lesser means, perhaps he felt a need to exude a 'gangster' image.<p>Given that I was one of the smallest guys in the class, that naturally meant I became a target.<p>At first I would try to ignore it, but it never went away.<p>Well, one day I decided I wasn't going to take it and I fought back. I hit him a few times and we rumbled together and I ended up having him in a 'sleeper hold' - i.e. my arm around & in front of his neck, with my other arm locked around the back of his head - with him fading quickly.<p>In a fit of desperation he quickly pulled out a compass (the one that had a 1-inch long point) and stabbed me in my arm - to get me to let go. Well, it worked, I let go instantly.<p>The pain was intense - but he was able to get his breath back. As soon as we both realized what he did, I turned to walk to the bathroom (because it had started bleeding by now), but he thought I was going to the principal's office. Naturally he ran after me apologizing profusely and literally BEGGED me not to go to the principal.<p>I bluffed a bit, and indicated to him that if he ever troubled me again I am going straight there.<p>That was the end of that...for the rest of my high school career he never troubled me again. As a matter of fact, if he ever saw anyone else try picking on me, he would kinda take up for me.<p>So while I wouldn't say 'take something hard and knock them in the back of their head' but simply fighting back and standing up for yourself can help significantly.<p>Although, a word of caution, I could have easily been stabbed elsewhere (like my eye, or head). So take that for what it's worth and advise your kids of the real potential consequences of fighting back - not to mention further retribution by the bully's friends (which is a very real possibility here in Jamaica).<p>That being said, I am definitely going to advise my son to hit back - but do it wisely and make sure not to do TOO much damage. i.e. once they back off, stop, leave, and report it (or not, as my case proved) or call me to at least let me know there was an issue.<p>Edit: Oh and for the record, the wound took about 2 months to heal properly and hurt like a mother-lover, for what it's worth.",1289512416

Bad point: all objects are boxed (like in JS). Good point: tail calls are handy when compiling all kinds of control structures.""<p>The boxing part is untrue. Even on 32-bit systems (that have word-aligned addressing, which all current 32-bit systems do), you can get 6 arbitrary type tags by using up the three least significant bits of a pointer (6 and not 8 because you use up two of the possible tag values for even/odd immediate integers (fixnums)).<p>Tail calls are overrated, maybe you're thinking about continuations? Those would have been truly terrible - you get all the downsides of concurrency with no benefits. One of the reasons arbitrary crap JS code runs as well as it does is because there's no possibility of concurrency. The browser event-loop model is a good one.<p>""- Java: As an IL to compile down to this would have been better than Javascript.

It works in theory, but it just causes a culture of violence.<p>People who are bullied are bullied because of they way they are perceived by others. You notice how there are a lot of neutral people who nobody bullies?<p>There are the bullies on one extreme, then there are a lot of neutrals, then there are the bullied on the other extreme. Asking a person who is bullied to hit someone is not solving the problem at all, it is actually contributing to the 'weirdness' factor that made that person bullied in the first place. The people who are bullied are not bullied just because they look physically weak, but because they are giving off the wrong social vibe. Doing something like hitting someone is not addressing the real issue.<p>To stop a child from being bullied, you need to address the short term problem, and you need to adress the long term problem. The short term problem is that the people need to stop, and the long term problem is that he needs to gain a lot of confidence and properly learn how to integrate himself in a social situation. He needs to learn to assert himself, and not be weak.<p>The short term solution can be solved without violence. If a person is bullying you, and you just say nothing, just scowl and lean towards the person with your arms swinging free, look straight into the eyes of the people without blinking, speak in a low cold voice, then walk away without looking back you can almost always stop further aggravation. Most bullied people make the mistake of smiling and trying to laugh off the problem, then going into a body posture that says they are defensive, and hopping from foot to foot or fiddling with clothes, and looking down. This encourages the bullies, because you are displaying beta-male behaviour.<p>The long term solution involves forcing the child into a lot of social activities, so that he learns how to establish and build social hierachies. Also, a lot of physical activity, particular where he can get to dominate, and also team sports where he is working with people less competent than him will also help teach him to assert himself.<p>Saying somethin like ""punch the person"" is not only not very clever, it's also practically undoable for most bullied people. Most bullied kids are small wimpy and non-assertive kids. They can't punch anyone. Don't give this pointless advice.",1289511813

1895397,comment,1895172,1895172,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"When lots of people (especially in a particular field) work long hours, it creates an expectation which negatively affects those who cannot or will not work long hours.<p>Compensation (both monetary and in the form of benefits) does not increase linearly with number of hours worked. If someone can only handle working 35 hours a week in the U.S., they won't be earning 87.5% of what they would if they worked 40 hours a week. This forces a lot of people into working more hours than they otherwise would.<p>If work is capped at 35 hours a week, then people don't have to work insane hours (I would classify 70+ hours a week as insane) to maximize their compensation per hour. They can maximize it at 35, which for most people, is a much more sustainable (in terms of mental and physical health) number of hours.<p>If the goal is to maximize the benefit to society produced by workers, then I think a far better method is directing people into work which actually benefits society. McDonald's, for example, employs 400k people worldwide, and as far as I'm concerned, they're working for a net loss in social benefit. Assuming the average McDonald's employee works only 25 hours per week, that's over 500 million worker-hours wasted each year. To put it another way, every year McDonald's wastes almost 6 millenia of labor.<p>If all workers were doing work that truly benefited society, I think 20 hours a week would probably be more than enough. Technology has made us, as a species, incredibly efficient. We can sustain ourselves with almost no effort. Most of the effort that <i>is</i> being expended is going to produce garbage food, garbage media and the garbage infrastructure necessary to consume the two.<p>Consider again the tale of the fisherman and the tourist (<a href=""http://tiki.oneworld.net/sustain/tourist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiki.oneworld.net/sustain/tourist.html</a> or if you read German, the original: <a href=""http://www.uni-flensburg.de/asta/pol_kultur_anekdote.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uni-flensburg.de/asta/pol_kultur_anekdote.htm</a>). <i>We can all be the fisherman.</i> We have the resources. I think the whole notion of limiting working hours in a week ultimately stems from this idea. I think it's a way of saying, ""We don't need more stuff. Take a break and enjoy what you have.""<p>But ultimately, I think it's designed to benefit those who would like to work 87.5% of the time for 87.5% of the pay, not those who have a bad work/life balance by choice. If I'm right, it might be better to make the law that employers must offer a part-time option (as long as it's not completely impractical to do so) with at least 95% total compensation parity (per hour worked) with full-time workers in the same position. It would also make sense to limit additional compensation for overtime workers to perhaps 105% of full-time compensation (per hour worked). This way workers could chose for themselves how to set their work/life balance. When part-time workers get 60% or 70% per hour (total compensation) of what full-time workers get, then the choice is largely out of their hands.",1289511763

They didn't sign up to necessarily share contact info. They signed up to connect socially. Do you expect twitter to start handing out email addresses of the people that sign up on Twitter.com? No because you sign up on Twitter to share short 140 character messages, not <i>email addresses</i> like you do when you sign up to use <i>Google Contacts.</i><p>If a third party application wants your email addresses, you can go <i>give it to them yourself.</i> Otherwise what's the point of Facebook making it dead simple for people to give third party apps your email address? The only reason I can think is that greedy third party apps want to siphon Facebook's built up social graph by using spammy viral emailing techniques as opposed to getting individual users to sign up or add the Facebook application.<p>Also correct me if I'm wrong, but Facebook does let you compare email hashes. So this allows 3rd party apps/sites to link two users up if they are friends on Facebook.<p>So in the end yes it is convenient for Facebook to take this stance of not making it easy to export your friends' email addresses but it truly does have a legitimate negative aspect to it.

It contains instructions for committing revolutionary acts we would call terrorism today. I went to buy a copy out of nostalgia, and in a stunning act of irony, it was in my bookstore's ""American History"" section. But at the time it was published, the ideas were radical and heavily disparaged. Should it have been censored? Should it be censored now?<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Steal-This-Book-Abbie-Hoffman/dp/156858217X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1289508930&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Steal-This-Book-Abbie-Hoffman/dp/15685...</a><p>Likewise, we can find lots of books about smoking and growing Cannabis. Judging by the glee with which the USA incarcerates its citizens for these activities, one would think that Cannabis is considered far, far more dangerous than gunpowder. Should they be censored?<p>I think we can make judgments about what a business that caters to a broad audience should or shouldn't do. But there's a very difficult freedom of speech issue here. The mere illegality of an activity isn't the litmus test for me, and neither is instructional content.",1289509204

Especially when I just want to do what amounts to scripting at times. Plus, it&#x27;s much easier/natural to run system commands for root related stuff on Android with Scala[2] than it is with Java[3]. Scala also has a superior SQL framework[4] to the cumbersome one that is built into Android for SQLite that requires a ton of boilerplate to actually make useful (especially if you wish to do asynchronous sql calls).<p>Using Async/Await[5] and Akka[6] are also great for mobile development when you want an alternative to the approaches built into android like AsyncTask and Handlers.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/yareally/android-scala-intellij-no-sbt-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/yareally/android-scala-intellij-no-sbt-pl...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://alvinalexander.com/scala/scala-execute-exec-external-system-commands-in-scala\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://alvinalexander.com/scala/scala-execute-exec-external-...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0014.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0014.html</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http://slick.typesafe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://slick.typesafe.com/</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/async.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/async.html</a><p>[6] I know there&#x27;s a Java version of Akka, but it&#x27;s not quite the same as using the Scala one.",1386546983

A layoff, even when it&#x27;s the right thing, is an admission of a business problem and a signal that the company won&#x27;t be hiring for a while. But evil startups use &quot;silent layoffs&quot; to save their image (&quot;we&#x27;ve never had a layoff&quot;) at the expense of those let go.<p>I do wonder what kind of backstory there was if they were afraid of people trashing the office. Usually people are pretty civilized when they are laid off-- especially if there&#x27;s a severance, which would be jeopardized by bad behavior (if you vandalize the office, you get zero because the &quot;severance&quot; is charges not being pressed).

6872083,comment,6871650,6871650,5,0,m0nastic,,,"This year I had an opportunity at my job to design a fairly large system under some (what seemed to me at least) pretty ideal circumstances:<p>1.) We didn&#x27;t have any existing infrastructure, so there were no requirements around language, environment, or tooling.<p>2.) I was the only person who would be developing the system.<p>3.) I was predominantly the only person who would be interacting with the system once it was deployed.<p>4.) Existing solutions to the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve are generally very expensive (either directly through the cost of the software, or indirectly through having to have professional services consultants do the integration), so it was pretty easy for this project to prove it&#x27;s worth.<p>5.) I&#x27;m not actually paid to be a developer, so if the whole thing turned out to be a dismal failure, my boss doesn&#x27;t care.<p>So I used this project as an opportunity to try out Haskell and Racket, two languages I didn&#x27;t have any prior experience with (I had learned Scheme in school through SICP but hadn&#x27;t touched it in 15 years).<p>I settled on Haskell for the parts of the system that were going to be deployed out in our environment. So far, that&#x27;s been a server that collects events, parses them, and then forwards them along. I liked that Haskell compiled to native code (I didn&#x27;t want the additional complexity of dealing with deploying an interpreter or virtual machine). I looked at using C and Go as well, as they both met all my criteria. Go doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me, which admittedly isn&#x27;t a great reason for not using it, but as I didn&#x27;t have to sell anyone else on my decisions, that was enough.  C is actually a more conventional fit for the type of server I built, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t go with C is that I honestly don&#x27;t trust myself to write performant, safe, C that I&#x27;d be comfortable deploying all around my enterprise.<p>That&#x27;s not an indictment of C, it&#x27;s an indictment of my abilities as a programmer. Thankfully, I&#x27;m not really a programmer, so I can still sleep at night.<p>In writing the server piece in Haskell, I discovered that most of my worries about it being an esoteric academic language were unfounded. I think most of that reputation comes from the fact that a large portion of the community using it is academic, so they use it for academic things, and tend to talk about it using &quot;computer science-y&quot; terminology. The Haskell planet blog aggregator, for instance, I&#x27;ve almost never found to be comprehensible. That&#x27;s not their fault though, it just doesn&#x27;t seem like muggles are writing blog posts about using Haskell to solve real problems. Hopefully that&#x27;ll change over time as the language becomes more wide-spread.<p>I was very impressed with using Haskell to parse events though; I think I&#x27;m ruined on ever going back to a language that only lets you use RegEx&#x27;s.<p>I was worried about how usable Haskell would be for really cookie-cutter systems type programming, as there isn&#x27;t a lot of material online to help you do that type of stuff. Real World Haskell turned out to be a super good book though, as it was much more closely aligned with what I was doing. I was also worried about the small number of libraries compared to 1st-tier languages, but for what it&#x27;s worth, that hasn&#x27;t really been an issue.<p>If I were a good Haskell programmer, I&#x27;d have no qualms about using it for everything, but I&#x27;m not (at least not yet), so I&#x27;m doing all the application logic and web UI stuff in Racket. Obviously, people use Haskell for web programming, and it seems like Yesod is getting much better, but it was much easier for me to get a simple web application thrown together with Racket, so that&#x27;s at least what I&#x27;ll be doing for the time being.<p>My experience with Racket has been similar: not many resources on people actually using it to solve real problems, not many libraries; but for doing a really simple CRUD web app that talks to Postgres, it wasn&#x27;t too bad to get working. The community is really great, maybe as a testament to its size, but I&#x27;ve been impressed by how helpful they are.<p>Deciding to use Racket over Clojure was a tough decision. Ultimately it came down to the fact that there was less cognitive load for me in how Racket worked when I didn&#x27;t also have any of the Java infrastructure underneath. I think one of Clojure&#x27;s greatest strengths is that it gives you all the interoperability with the Java ecosystem (which I think is one reason for it&#x27;s adoption); but I&#x27;ve never programmed in Java, so all of that familiarity isn&#x27;t present for me; it just seems like an albatross. Even all the tooling around builds and deployment seemed like a lot to get acclimated to, although I&#x27;m sure if I had just gone ahead and used Clojure, I&#x27;d have figured all that stuff out.<p>I&#x27;m envious of the fact that a lot of Clojure&#x27;s libraries seem to be created by people solving concrete problems, and in general I like the pragmatism of that community. Maybe eventually I&#x27;ll move from Racket to Clojure, but I haven&#x27;t yet tried to do anything in Racket that makes me regret having chosen it.",1386546650

Programmed games in AMOS (Amiga, BASIC with sprites and bobs, collision detection etc). Did some QBASIC, and Visual Basic. A bit of BZ (scripting language for BBS). Didn&#x27;t do much programming for a bunch of years.<p>In 2004, I was living in an apartment in China, with a lot of time on my hands. Heard about Python and Ruby - gave Python a try, but got stuck on something trivial and had nobody to help me. With Ruby, I didn&#x27;t get stuck. Used it on and off for years for small private projects, and two NGO internships where I used Ruby and RoR (but wasn&#x27;t hired for it).<p>Still use Ruby for a lot of side projects, text wrangling, scraping etc. Began learning R for data wrangling/statistics/visualization. Amazing ecosystem, annoying language. Heard about Clojure and began playing with it after reading lots of interesting blog posts etc. My first intro to Lisp and functional programming. Liked a lot of it, but not crazy about JVM and stack-traces.<p>Through reading about Clojure, got interested in Haskell, and read a bunch about it - very interesting exposure to a ton of new concepts (which Clojure had warmed me up for). Also began looking at Julia for statistics, and lately had a look at both Nimrod and Elixir (which again introduced me to lot&#x27;s of new ideas from Erland).<p>I&#x27;ve learnt a huge amount in the last year, and had my eyes opened to new paradigms. Still haven&#x27;t really settled on anything new, and in the meantime I keep going back to Ruby and R to get stuff done.<p>Going back many years, choosing Python instead of Ruby might have been a better choice - it&#x27;s clearly far ahead of Ruby in terms of academia - data science, machine learning, IPython Notebook, etc. However, knowing Ruby Python is almost too similar - like learning French while speaking Spanish...  I can already read it, and don&#x27;t feel motivated to spend the time to learn it, more attracted by new languages with other paradigms etc. (Why I&#x27;m spending time learning Russian as well :)).",1386546504

Boost makes some things a bit easier (boost::bind and boost::function are incredibly useful), but it always feels you&#x27;re fighting against the language.

I wanted to learn how to program it, someone pointed me toward C++.<p>Fast forward to grad school, where I was working on a big project using C++.  We nearly missed our deadline because we were all so busy trying to get C++ code to work.  We worked hard to squeeze out performance, yet we were still barely able to get the results we published, and we missed some of our goals.  The next iteration of the project called for high-level changes that promised much better performance, but which required a far more complicated program.  C++ would have been a nightmare, so I took a risk and switched languages (a big risk in retrospect, since it meant rewriting much of the C++ code).  Here is what I was looking for:<p>* A short learning process, at least to learn enough to start writing real code<p>* Reasonable performance<p>* Well-developed tools and documentation<p>I stumbled across Common Lisp, and it basically met these criteria.  SBCL and CMUCL are very mature compilers, Emacs+SLIME is fantastic as an IDE, and CL&#x27;s documentation is easy to find.  The syntax of Lisp is dead simple which makes the learning curve very easy; you can bootstrap enough knowledge of the language to write real applications in a week or so (and more advanced features can be found as you dive deeper).  Early on I noticed that I was spending almost all of my mental effort on the logic of my program, not on low-level mechanics -- even while I was debugging, and even when confronted with hard-to-identify problems, I was spending all my time thinking about logic (as opposed to C++, where I spent about 50% of my time debugging low-level issues that had nothing to do with logic errors).  One very nice property of Lisp is that the <i>default</i> behavior is to be <i>safe</i>, and you can override this as an optimization (and you must be rather explicit about it).<p>Since then the project has gone through yet another iteration and another rewrite, which met even greater success as I was far more comfortable and capable with the language.  We have sent this code to others, and the majority of bug reports we have received have been about missing features rather than program crashes.<p>Now, Lisp is by no means perfect.  At the high-level, there are few standard data structures; these are not hard to write, but why reinvent the wheel or be forced to pull in third party code?  There is also no standard support for things like sockets, and only minimal support for binary data formats (which sometimes one must deal with).  For low-level code, things are not easy; neither SBCL nor CMUCL make debugging across the FFI boundary easy, and there is a serious performance hit that the FFI imposes.  It would also be nice to have an optional static type system, though type hints are often good enough (SBCL and CMUCL can do a fair bit of static type checking), and for the metaobject protocol to be standardized.",1386545140

There are many examples of this kind of thing -- and private insurers aren&#x27;t pushing back on the costs, either.<p>Take the anti-viral drugs acyclovir and valacyclovir.  They&#x27;re both anti-virals used to treat diseases caused by the herpes simplex virus (e.g. shingles, chicken pox, cold sores, herpes, etc.), and are both commonly prescribed to patients of all ages.  The only difference between them is that valacyclovir is a pro-drug -- it metabolizes to acyclovir -- and has slightly higher bioavailability, which means that patients can take three doses a day, instead of five.  Otherwise, they&#x27;re equivalently effective medications.<p>Granted, three doses a day is easier on patients than five doses a day, but that convenience comes at a cost:  valacyclovir costs about five times as much as acyclovir.  Your doctor won&#x27;t tell you this -- she&#x27;ll just prescribe the valacyclovir, in nearly all cases -- and your private insurance company won&#x27;t do anything to encourage you to take one drug over the other.  About the only way you&#x27;d know is if you tried to buy the drug without insurance, and your pharmacist told you that you could use this <i>other, cheaper</i> medication to save a lot of money.<p>Not only are &quot;entitlement programs&quot; not the problem here, they could actually be the solution:  a single-payer health system would have an economic incentive to push back on providers, and encourage them to use more cost-effective drugs.  Our current, private insurance system is almost totally blind to cost effectiveness, because nobody in the chain has any incentive to care.  The final costs of the system get passed back to employers in the form of annual rate increases, when it&#x27;s too late to do anything about them.",1386544953

These were the languages used at work, so I was restricted to these) filled me with confidence. So I went looking, found Haskell and the &quot;Learn You a Haskell (for Great good)&quot; book, skimmed through it, loved it, bought it, studied it for months. But I never did anything with Haskell, it&#x27;s a great language, but I never found a task I could do with it, to experiment and deepen my knowledge.<p>At the same time, I&#x27;ve always been fond of Lisp (due to Emacs, Sawfish and partly GIMP-Fu I believe), and one day, reading HN, I came across Clojure. A functional Lisp on the JVM, with great interop, and strong support for concurrency. Hell yes! I toyed around with it too, but shelved it soon after, until I found a problem I could solve with it. And solve I did. The sheer beauty of the language still mesmerises me. It&#x27;s insanely powerful, yet concise and easy to understand.<p>The thing that got me hooked into Clojure was that I could express myself a lot easier and a lot better with it, than in any other language I worked with before (and I worked with a <i>lot</i> of languages in the past). Everything else (core.logic, core.async, overtone, riemann, pedestal and ClojureScript) is just an added bonus.",1386544176

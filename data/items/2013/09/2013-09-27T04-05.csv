6455291,comment,6450604,6450604,1,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I have the same number of feet but one more knee than this guy.  From what I understand about above-the-knee prosthetics, walking up stairs with a &quot;normal&quot; gait is an impressive feat.  Clearly, the technology is near-miraculous.<p>With all this said, I&#x27;d much rather see advances in bionic attachment techniques.  If I could have a metal rod extending from the distal end of my tibia through skin, being without a foot would be much less annoying, and my physical abilities would improve significantly.  I could just clamp on a prosthetic in the form of a carbon fiber spring -- the same sort I have now.  Presuming the rod required little maintenance, I would require far fewer trips to the prosthetist for construction of new sockets as the shape of my residual limb (the politically correct term for &quot;stump&quot;) changes over time.  No risk of skin issues preventing me from using my prosthetic leg.  No risk of catching my prosthetic foot on something while walking and pulling it off my body.  Current socket-based attachment techniques create what effectively is an extra joint with very limited range of motion.   Oddly, this is useful for subtle manipulation of a gas pedal (I&#x27;m missing my right foot), but it is mechanically inefficient, reduces my perception of stability, and keeps me from feeling like the prosthetic foot is &quot;mine&quot;.  Because of this extra joint, heavy shoes feel really heavy.  Lots of effort has gone into making prosthetic feet light -- a much less valuable attribute if direct body attachment was possible.  Reducing the value of making prosthetics lightweight would allow for all sorts of innovation.<p>My understanding of the current state of affairs is that, while it&#x27;s quite easy to stick a metal rod into the distal end of a bone, it&#x27;s quite difficult to allow it to protrude through skin without risking infection.  My general take when reading yet another article about some amazing $100K prosthetic device is similar to my thoughts when hearing fuel cell folks talking up the technology in the early 2000&#x27;s -- They all showed up at tech events talking about how fuel cells were going to change the world, how their own novel technology was going to make them more efficient, lighter, whatever.  My question to them was always, &quot;When am I going to be able to replace my laptop battery with a fuel cell so I can take a cross-country flight without worrying about my battery running low?&quot;  They always gave some vague answer and then went on talking about the improvements they were making to a technology which was not at all available to me.  It&#x27;s 2013, and I haven&#x27;t yet owned a fuel cell.  However, I&#x27;m writing this on a Mac with much better battery life than was available a decade ago even though the fundamental technology used in its battery is unchanged.",1380257201

6455277,comment,6454157,6454157,2,0,contingencies,,,"Yes, care. However, this article is a strong but partial articulation of the overwhelming issues with present-era financial systems, the roots of which go far beyond merely Bitcoin. I addressed more of these in my talk at <i>Observe, Hack, Make 2013</i> (OHM2013) two months ago on <i>Finance & The Future Beyond Bitcoin</i>.<p>This article addresses Bitcoin as a protocol, a commodity, and an ecosystem. These perspectives might be understood in terms of their mapping to William Stanley&#x27;s classical theory on the functions of money[1], namely: <i>a medium of exchange, a common measure of value (or unit of account), a standard of value (or standard of deferred payment), and a store of value</i>; also summarized in 1919 by Jevons: <i>Money&#x27;s a matter of functions four: a Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store</i>.<p>The first perspective (<i>Bitcoin as a protocol</i>) and second perspective (<i>Bitcoin as a commodity</i>) could be mapped to the first function (<i>medium of exchange</i>) and second/third functions (<i>unit of account/standard of payment</i>). Bitcoin may not be ideal as a store of value for a variety of reasons (relative difficulty of exchange for conventional currency, small relative market size leading to overall volatility and fundamental price manipulability), which is probably why this perspective is missing. Other currencies or assets types exist that can or have <i>already</i> been designed specifically to maximize their value from this, and each of the classical perspective: a classic case is the &quot;basket of commodities&quot; approach proposed for use as a more stable <i>standard of measure</i> (also providing more stable <i>store of value</i> features if it can be commodified as an investment).<p>So we can see there are more options here than just Bitcoin and its distributed single-asset blockchain siblings (a fact which the Bitcoin community often seems to overlook), and theories and tools that do answer some of the obvious challenges. But there are also other issues, issues which drive to the heart of our societies, that desperately need to be better understood by innovators and participants in our economies.<p>Since there are recent books[3] eloquently evidence the fact, take it for now that money conventionally is all about control, and typically occurs only in warmaking/expansionist societies that systemify inequality and tend to have lost any sense of cohesive social concern. This control is of the state - widely defined as a &quot;monopoly of force&quot; - for organizing the logistical support required to field larger armies and for taxation of the overall population. It&#x27;s rather worrisome to realise, particularly if you have been lucky enough to experience some of the few but still extant cultures in which money is not yet dominant in the social order and how greatly its absence seems to enhance people&#x27;s mutual trust, assistance and cohesion. Changing the nature of money, then, actually fundamentally threatens the notion of state. The truths of world financial surveillance and control presently include the fact that all international transfers, even within<p>Over the last three years at Payward, I&#x27;ve also been lucky enough to meet Bitcoin enthusiasts and business people, high frequency trading (HFT) experts from some of the world&#x27;s largest investment banks, international political/law specialists, monetary theorists and community currency associations. All are fascinated by the era and bring different perspectives, yet perhaps none of us fully understand the breadth of concerns at play. We can, however, elucidate what Bitcoin and brethren represent: the first major crack in long held, effectively state-linked and inter-state coordinated, near-global, back-scratching monopoly of usury and control, a crack in which is already impossible to close through regulatory action. A crack which potentially offers the beginnings of far-reaching, positive changes in our challenged world.<p>We see the future as one of opt-in choice and interoperability (since - if pigs might jump some distance on occasion - forcing a state-run, centralized monetary system on people may actually one day be challenged successfully as a breach of human rights), and thus looking beyond any immediate and concrete benefit for our own company, Payward have graciously been supporting me in proposing various standards as IETF Internet Standards Drafts through an open membership entity, the IFEX Project[4]. Namely X-ISO4217-A3[5] (open identification of currency-like commodities to bypass ISO registration issues), IIBAN[6] (open identification of financial endpoints), IMIC[7] (open identification of financial markets).<p>We are also (slowly!) brainstorming on a transaction-level protocol, IFEX[8], both asset/currency/commodity neutral and settlement system neutral, to tie together disparate systems while addressing concrete issues of settlement path limitations, latency, normalized transaction status and adequate hooks out to potentially produce full-featured risk/trust/compliance systems. This protocol aims to equally describe commodities such as energy (in a full scale grid, or an embedded system) or physical assets within a modern or emerging &#x27;distributed manufacturing&#x27; (3D-printing-style) supply chain.  In short we aim to provide a coherent, logical, transparent platform upon which emerging settlement paths can compete with conventional settlement paths on a fair basis. A free market for financial services, if you will, but one which removes the distinction between goods and money. Simple in conception, rather more difficult to execute than it sounds, and fantastically threatening to some established interests. Right now we really need other groups getting in to participate.<p>TL/DR: This article is really about some issues with the current financial system. Bitcoin is only one proposed system, and it is not suitable for all occasions. Broader financial reform is going on, and we will see more than one solution. This change is a challenge not only to nations themselves (who will ultimately have to accept it by broadening their own fiscal systems to include alternative asset classes), but more immediately to the rather sickly back-scratching coordination that goes on between them and functions to prevent innovation, surveil and control even across borders. Decades of haughty &#x27;free market&#x27; and &#x27;human rights&#x27; rhetoric are reaching their logical conclusion: technologies and legal structures that function to remove the old, clunky system of control and usury through local fiscal monopoly. To let the imagination flow: we potentially stand on the threshold of global society&#x27;s yet greatest rennaissance.<p>[1] Jevons, William Stanley. (1875) <i>Money and the Mechanism of Exchange</i>

The vast majority of economically necessary work, after all, simply is not.  Even double-digit percentage improvements in the reliability of cloud computing nodes, for instance, are not a Cause.  They are a very economically significant piece of technological development that can make anyone who develops them a bunch of revenue.

Photons have many tremendous advantages over most other things people have thought of, but some huge weaknesses.  One of them is that it&#x27;s very hard to get photons to interact with each other.  If you can&#x27;t make qubits interact with each other then you can&#x27;t build a logic gate. That means you&#x27;re humped.

It privileges <i>one and only one</i> view of the problem domain. As soon as you need some other view, you are in trouble.

6455188,comment,6454140,6454994,15,0,chrissnell,,,"Well said.<p>If properly picked and hired, junior-level inexperienced engineers can be a gold mine.  Employers need to retune their hiring process to value intellect and potential over straight-up experience and know-it-all-ness.  This is a tricky proposition, since many hiring managers are terribly inexperienced with hiring and don&#x27;t know how to do much more than coding challenges, &quot;explain to me how DNS works&quot; questions, etc.  These hiring managers are trying to compare their own skills against this new hires and they will reject the hire if it doesn&#x27;t match up.  Huge fail.  The gold miner hiring manager, however, asks more open-ended questions to probe the intellect of the hire.  The gold miner doesn&#x27;t expect a &quot;full-stack hacker&quot; and is tolerant of &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; responses.  The more important question: what problems has this person solved and how did they solve them?<p>If you want to see how to hire and structure your team, a good example to follow is the military.  Consider the typical  platoon of Infantry soldiers:  you have one senior leader/manager, one senior subject matter expert and all-round ass-kicker, four SME-and-ass-kickers-in-training, and about 36 junior guys who are there to learn.   The junior guys make a fraction of what the senior SME makes and their skill level is also fractional.  No worries.  They are there to learn, develop, and do their best.  Treat them well, not like slaves, , respect them, and develop them.  Most of them will leave after a few years for a new job elsewhere.  That&#x27;s okay.  You got something from them (work) and they got something from you (experience).  You, the leader, will identify a few promising individuals amongst them and groom them to be SMEs in training, giving them the added responsibility and pay increases that they deserve.  Like an Infantry platoon, your team will eventually hire experienced SMEs from outside the company to bring in fresh skills and ideas.  If this team building is done right, you can build a loyal, organic organization that grows and trains it&#x27;s own and you can do it for about the same cost as going out and hiring three or four absolute badasses that will probably leave as soon as the next shiny, well-paying thing comes along.",1380255204

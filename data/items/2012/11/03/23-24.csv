That person waiting by the car may be meeting the owner and looking for his approach.  But knowing that people have suspicions can  allow property owners to turn on lights and do other things to communicate that the chances of being caught are not low.<p>Cops could also use suspicion data to decide where cops should be when there is no crime.

You'll get no end of ""all scientists believe in global warming[1]"" and downvotes, for this scientific fact.<p>[1] This is, by far, the most anti-intellectual and offensive statement.  Science doesn't work by majority. Worse, it is simply factually false. There is no survey of scientists to determine their votes, and there is a sizable contingent of scientists who refute it or dispute it.  Further, the references to ""science"" that this side makes generally come from IPCC reports, which is to say, reports prepared by politicians which in the past have often been refuted by the very scientists whose research they claim to be summarizing.<p>This issue is really a good one, because it is a purely scientific one, it is relatively straightforward and easy to disprove (Mars was warming at the same time, with the earth and the solar cycle, despite having no Hummers, the earth has been getting cooler for the past decade, despite CO2 going up, the ""warming"" period coincides with ice ages, and the ""evidence"", namely the Mann ""hockey stick"" was the result of outright fraud).... yet the people who believe it believe it for ideological reasons, and actually reject science, making scientific discussions impossible.   (Global warming is the left's creationism!)   all you can get is insistence that all scientists believe in it (all christians believe in creationism, right?  Actually they don't all believe in it, possibly a majority don't.) Or you can get pointers to scientific sounding blog posts that at the root end up being nonsense.<p>The closest I've ever gotten to an actual scientific debate on global warming was with a physicist who, in the end, was reduced to insisting that man made carbon dioxide had different effects on the atmosphere than ""naturally occurring"" carbon dioxide.   At that point I gave up- I can't argue with a belief like that.<p>How many people do you think on Hacker News believe in Global Warming?  How many of them have ever looked up the IR absorption of CO2?  Or would listen to that point?<p>How many people on Hacker News reject intellectual property out of hand?  How many of them can derive, from first principles, an explanation for any private property ownership?  I believe the former is the majority and the latter is a tiny fraction.  Yet they ""believe in private property"" -- but only situationally.  (EG: Ok to steal movies, but not cars, or money, unless you're the government, then its ok to steal money if you call it taxes.  Is that not a reasonable characterization of ""leftist"" positions?  Ok, then how can a leftist believe in the principle of private property if its sometimes ok to steal?

Optional daily reminders on weekdays; this would encompass the videos you should watch and the readings you should complete that day to stay even with the course schedule, the upcoming class assignments and the results of the last assignment, as well as a digest of forum threads.<p>3. In tandem with the above, improved course dashboards; there should be one place to go to find out what you should look at, read, or do; next.<p>4. Video editing and presentation coaching for instructors. Some people are really good at presenting course material, others need some editorial coaching to focus their videos. I can think of a couple of courses where the lecturers lack of stage presence and inability to be concise made watching the videos such a chore that I would rather do anything else than watch them; and that's often the point where I decide my life won't be worse if I drop that course and see if I can find a different one covering the same material.<p>On another note: Does anyone offer a course on how to read mathematical notation?

This wasn't it.<p>Take periodic task A, such as making dinner or sitting down to work. You do this task on a mostly regular basis. Doing this task creates waste: a dirty sink, an unclean workspace, and so on. When you complete the task, it often seems like yet another task (B) to accomplish when tired to do the cleaning. Thus your workspace starts to degrade. The next time you need to do task A, you have to do task B first. You're psyched and ready to do task A, but you <i>can't</i>, because task B wasn't done. And task B is not what you're psyched for.<p>All the article is pointing out is that you need to do task B as soon as you're done with task A. That way, when you come back the next day to go for task A, you don't have a preliminary step to go through before you can <i>really</i> get started.<p>> Although how one could test the idea proposed in the blog is unclear to me.<p>Take any such pair of tasks and measure the time it takes to get started on the task pair over the course of a decent period of time, such as a month. Try to have a balance of which task is performed first. By ""time it takes to get started"", I mean the the delta between the time you say, ""I should do task A"", and the time you actually start doing either task.<p>Of course, that's subject to the observer effect: noting down the time at which you say you should do it will probably in itself incentivize you.

4738216,comment,4737736,4738064,2,0,zeynalov,,,"Thanks for reply. I've already read The Lean Startup. The reason why I say 99% I'm sure that it'll be successful, is I talk to 23 of my potential costumers and 22 of them said Yes I would definitely buy your product, I like it and I need it. One of them said, mmm I must see the software now I can't tell anything. It's related to medicine, and because me too have this kind of problem and all other my doctor friends, I think it will work.<p>Some time ago I've tried to learn Ruby on Rails but in my first week I saw that it's not that easy. I've learned how to make a website, blog etc., but making complex softwares are too hard for me. I need some time, which I don't have. Every workday I must be at the clinic and I have too many patients, I come home very tired, even though I work on my startup.<p>One thing I don't understand, why should one learn to code, if he has enough money to hire someone to code? I always see everywhere that founders must learn to code. Why? I understand that it will save money and you can do whatever you want, you'll have freedom by coding. But is it worth it? To be able to code as an average hacker you should spend at least 3 month to learn to code.",1351984147

A 28 year old may have less programming experience and help from sites like MakeGamesWithUs and still complete similar projects. Why is it so important that he's 14? He obviously isn't the only 14 year old coding and completing a project, it's not even that rare anymore. Probably not as rare as a woman making iPhone app, at least. With today's technology, everybody over the age of 12 can learn programming, build apps and complete university classes.<p>I post my projects to HN too, I have only once reached the front page.

4738207,comment,4735633,4738137,2,0,robomartin,,,"Given those two choices, I don't know. We don't know enough about their views across a wide range of topics outside of technology.<p>You might want to go back and research presidents before television and the internet.  Some of the most effective ones had pretty shitty personalities and habits.  Today they'd never make it.<p>My only argument is that we are probably keeping a lot of really good candidates from participating in the process because the focus is on whether or not you look great and do well in a talk show and give it to the other guy in a debate rather than what really matters.<p>Here's an imperfect analogy.  I've been sailing since, well, forever.  I'll go out in almost any weather because I have confidence in my abilities.  As long as the boat is in good shape and can handle it, I can.  I am also pretty good at sailing when there's almost no wind, when you really have to optimize things to generate propulsion with almost no power available.<p>I see lots of people at the marina who come out with the latest gear.  They look good. No, they look great.  Beautiful shirts, and marine coats and boots and brand new lines on the boat, perfect new sails and all the gear sparkles.  But they can't sail worth a damn.  They motor out of the marina, put up the sails, go around and around a few times and motor back in.  All show and no go.  Don't even ask them to go sailing at night. They'll piss in their Gucci pants.<p>These people show well, talk the talk and seem to walk the walk but are worthless as far as sailing is concerned.  I know this all too well, I did an island crossing one time with one of these folks and it nearly cost me my life as I was hanging on to the boom while reefing in a storm 'cause the idiot didn't know how to keep the thing into the wind.<p>My point is that the system we have in place today gives zero room to those with real expertise.  Look at Obama as one example:  Not one company would have hired him to even run a cookie baking operation in 2008.  Yet, he got the country to run.  Are we morons or what?  And how about little-Bush?  Do I even need to get into how moronic it was for someone like that to be on a ticket?  And, Sarah Palin?  Really?  Are we all a bunch of lobotomized robots or is it the system?<p>My admittedly flawed ideas straight from utopia seek to change things up so that other people, those who can really sail, might have a chance to get the helm.  It should not cost a billion dollars to run for president.  We should use the Internet to allow lots of people to participate in the contest and let voters engage in a fact-based search that takes a whole year.  It's almost like these dating services that don't let you meet in person or see pictures of each other until successful and valuable interaction has taken place over a period of time.<p>Anyhow, it will never happen.  Politicians have too much invested in keeping their sweet rides going.  I swear that some of these people would be selling used cars if they didn't have an opening into politics.",1351984055

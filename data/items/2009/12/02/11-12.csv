Nothing morally wrong there.<p>Further, lets say that 90% fee on current sales goes into the pool of money for signing new bands who might be successful.

Yet, you think that Craigslist cannot?<p>My point is that their closeness will be major factor in their failure.<p>EDIT: I don't buy Craigslist hype. To me, their service is poor. Outside the US, especially in the East Europe, there's a lot of better alternatives. There was a lot of discussions why they succeed. I point out how they're likely to fail.",1259754993

In JavaScript I miss named arguments (e.g. <i>def fun(name, age, gender=1, height=None)</i>), which is very useful especially if one calls stuff like <i>Person(""Bob"", 13, height=150)</i>.<p>Generally, I don't think these kind of improvements are appreciated in C# as they are polymorphic and make it much harder for the compiler.<p><pre><code>  The optional arguments feature is to define a function like def fun(..., **kw)</code></pre>",1259753153

971874,comment,971454,971454,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Camarades.com was funded from a software licensing scheme that brought in about 700,000 annually. In one year all the licensing income was spent on salaries for employees we hired and bandwidth (which was very expensive back then), the second year the business became profitable when we added 24x7 media advertising.<p>The licensing deal was abolished and the licensed software became completely free as long as people would host their video streams with us.<p>After that the whole thing was spun out as a different company underneath the parent, and extra shareholders came on board.<p>All told I figure about a million went in to it before it was really profitable, because it was launched off an existing stream of income we had in that sense a relatively easy time of it. It definitely is a lot of money to spend on something you are not sure is going to take off though, fortunately it did.",1259752096
971873,comment,971785,971785,0,0,shawndrost,,,"This is not a very informative news article, but I did some research and here's what I think is happening: Google has always required that indexed sites show the indexed content to visitors that come through Google (to prevent bait-and-switch tactics).  They're now allowing indexed sites to use bait-and-switch tactics after the fifth visit in one day.<p>This actually seems like it will have some noticeable (unintended) effects: won't it apply equally to Experts Exchange and their ilk?<p>(It's not clear what this all has to do with ""First Click Free"", which is an old program that seems to offer a smaller loophole in the ""no bait-and-switch"" rules.  It's easiest to explain by example: If you go to a WSJ story via google, then click a link to another story, WSJ may ask you to register without being penalized by Google, even if that link didn't lead to a registration wall to the googlebot.)",1259752051

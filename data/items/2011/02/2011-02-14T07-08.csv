There's lots of things that can be improved on Wikipedia, but it requires people to: 1) become familiar with how things work; 2) become familiar with why things came to be that way; and 3) come up with workable proposals to improve things that take into account various problems those proposals themselves could cause.<p>But pitchforks and flamage are easier, I guess.

I think there's something to be said about having the system use how others are reacting to your comments rather than just what your content is and who links to it.  Yes, you could farm out Delicious accounts and have them bookmark your site, but from a SE perspective it's easier to remedy this problem (Delicious requiring captchas periodically, looking for accounts which have an uncanny amount of similar bookmarks in a span of time, etc) than it is to come up with strange rules about content that the black hat is free to change.<p>Judging by the votes, apparently it is more valuable to point out why a certain idea might not work, even if all of the alternatives have the same problem, than it is to suggest something with exciting possibilities.

If you edit war over it you will lose.<p>Plan B does not work.  Wikipedia guidelines do not consider self-published sources as 'reliable' and things published by Lulu are considered self-published.  Wikipedia does not consider itself a reliable source either.  It is also not going to disappear in a puff of logic like God in hhgttg, no matter how witty you think it is.<p>Plan C has not worked in the years of people deleting things that appeal to far broader audiences than esoteric programming languages.  They are still around.  How well do you think this will work?<p>Plan D is something many people have done.  In a way, Wikia is a giant example of it.  In other cases they go to wikinfo or create their own wiki.<p>This post is exactly like 100s of others that someone writes whenever Wikipedia deletes (or even tries to delete) something that they care about.  The ground is well-tread and it brings nothing new or interesting to the table.  The internet does not need another blog post where someone spends an hour in isolation writing about it.<p>On an irrelevant note, mediawiki does support subpages (the slashes), but articles cannot have them as article titles may contain slashes.

2215826,comment,2215080,2215080,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"When an entrepreneur gets a ""rejection"" by a venture partner, that is only very weak evidence that there is anything wrong with the entrepreneur's project.  Instead, the project might become very successful.  Uh, a venture partner is not some wise judge obligated to thoroughly evaluate all the projects and pick the best ones.  In particular he is not obligated to fund all the good projects.<p>Instead a venture partner is just a person, with some time, energy, interests, expertise, obligations, and, usually, funds.  So when an entrepreneur contacts venture partners, major fractions of those partners:<p>(1) are fully busy with their current investments, e.g., helping troubled CEOs, doing triage, or trying to arrange exits,<p>(2) are busy raising a new fund from the limited partners (much like the entrepreneurs try to do from the venture partners),<p>(3) are near the end of their last fund and maybe making some follow-on investments but no new investments until they get a new fund (if they do),<p>(4) are close to retirement and just winding down,<p>(5) are looking to leave their present firm for another venture firm or maybe something else,<p>(6) are focusing on investments at a stage different from the entrepreneur's project,<p>(7) are focusing on a 'space' different from the entrepreneur's project,<p>(8) have their voice-mail and e-mail in-boxes full and are only looking at deals already filtered for them by a few people they know,<p>(9) have already made a lot of money and just are not working very hard now,<p>(10) are geographically too far from the entrepreneur.<p>Also, venture partners just rarely look at seed or Series A deals in any great detail.  In particular only a tiny fraction of venture partners have the time, patience, and qualifications for looking at details.<p>Instead of details or anything thorough, to save time and brain energy, venture partners concentrate on a few surrogate decision criteria.  For a seed deal for, say, a Web 2.0 project, they see if the area of the company is hot and if the team has made money for venture partners before and maybe try the user interface and evaluate the user experience.  Again for Web 2.0, for a Series A, they look at ComScore numbers and revenue and earnings numbers.<p>Or, a venture partner tries to invest in some deals where they can make some money but do not put in all the extra effort needed to invest in all good deals or find the very best deals.  They don't worry that they might miss a good deal.  For missing the next Google, they believe that no one in venture capital can detect the next Google in seed and Series A deals so don't worry about that.<p>This isn't the best they would, could, or should do; and it's not what their Web site or public image suggests they do; it's just what they do do.",1297669263

For example, there's now things like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(academics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(academics...</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(music)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(music)</a>.<p>Factor is an interesting case. I tried to improve that article at one point by adding references, but I was unable to find any. As far as I can tell, it's almost never actually mentioned in the programming language community: not mentioned in a single book, even books about Forth-like languages, has no articles about it (in workshops, conferences, or anything), and its website has been mentioned in passing in four papers according to Google Scholar (the papers provide no real info on it besides mentioning in passing that it exists). It appears to have some level of notability among PLs aficionados, but if you were trying to discern that by reading the PLs literature, you wouldn't know it.<p>Clean is quite easy to find references for, though, so not sure how someone could've argued about that one in good faith.<p>It is something of a problem for things that are ""known"" in an area but don't have many references, because I do think Wikipedia's insistence on third-party sources is a good idea: an article based entirely on a few sources written by the subject and associates of the subject isn't great, like an article about a band that only cites the band's website, MySpace, and a few mentions on people's blogs. But how do you distinguish that case from the well-known-but-has-few-good-references case, and then how do you write an article about the latter? Here's a music example that might be analogous to some of these programming languages, a record label that's well-known in the postindustrial sphere, but has no good sources as far as I can find: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Europa_Cafe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Europa_Cafe</a>. How should one improve the article, and what should the information in it be referenced to?<p>The long-term solutions here are to improve the literature: someone needs to write a more recent book or survey article on emerging programming languages, and someone else needs to write a book on 1980s/90s independent postindustrial record labels. Then Wikipedia can just cite those books.

He said he tends to think in ratios and showed me that some (easy to calculate) ratios from early in my lecture did not agree with ratios calculated later in the lecture, which revealed the mistake.  He explained that he acquired the habit from using a slide rule when he was in school.

Incidentally, my lack of a degree has never gotten in the way of an opportunity.<p>One argument for going to school is you get access to people you might not get access to otherwise. I say if you know what you want, and who can help you get there, you'll find a way to get access to the people you need. Especially if you're young. Being young is a huge advantage when looking for help if you can shut up and be humble when asking for it.<p>That said, I think having a business degree might have been useful. The problem there is that smart people can figure out the nuts and bolts of business as challenges of running a business present themselves.<p>The nuts and bolts of managing/leading/inspiring others is another story. Sadly they don't seem to teach that in business school. Even if they did, it wouldn't make it much easier. You have to just do it for a while and stay committed to learning it while you go through hell for the first couple years.<p>It's really a personal decision. Personally, if I could do it all over again I wouldn't waste the 3 years that I did. Instead I'd get a few roommates who attend some school and a campus apartment so I can have the ""social experience"" while I work on my own stuff during the day.",1297667339

It should not be the only thing taught, but it should definitely be in the curriculum, and in a substantial amount, at least in the first few years. I think it lays a lot of ground work for further mathematical reasoning. Probably the most compelling reason, though, is that in mathematics you're assumed to have a certain degree of competency with computation. If you can't add or multiply small numbers in your head, you would be out of place among the current crop of mathematicians. While not everyone is trying to be a mathematician, it seems that it's not a good idea to remove something so fundamental that is essentially taken for granted in certain fields.",1297667304

It is not surprising at all that they do not go tooting their horn with gay abandon about a particular implementation (or coursework grades). The vehicle of that idea is no less important.The notion of an electron may be more important than the instrument used to discover it, but that does not mean that the instrument has no place.<p>I would argue that the deleted articles are more important than an articles on, say, Java which does not bring any new ideas and I hear about it all the time. I don't need Wikipedia for it. But I do need it for languages like Pure.<p>I think it is more important that articles about relatively obscure but influential languages like Alice are preserved. It lets a potential CS student get excited/interested in something and pursue it further. Not everyone will be digging up old PL folklore. Wikipedia is one of the few, largely spam free, venues where on could come in contact with them.<p>Wikipedia serves an important purpose of disseminating knowledge in an accessible form to all. If any purpose was at all served by the deletion, it is hardly much different from dilettante vandalism: destruction of potential value to a reader.<p>What about human languages. There could be a human language that has remained isolated for the most part and only few speak it, that in itself will be a fascinating thing to know about. Does it mean that Wikipedia will not have space for an article on it.<p>Peripherally: many if not most grad students would get an A in PL if they are taking that course, and will prove theorems if one works on theorem proving or verification. I don't see anything special about that.",1297667264

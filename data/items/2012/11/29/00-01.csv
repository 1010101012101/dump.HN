It is just that the current tools for working with them are currently so hyper-specialized to each individual field that they are 'ghettos' that most smart, general-purpose developers never enter.<p>We're all blind to things our current tools don't permit us to explore.<p>As a random example, I bet that many cloud-based services could (but probably don't) do reliability analysis of their services under different independence assumptions. Are the weak links what you thought they were? What if you updated your model as various things failed / rolled over, so that you could run to put out the fires that are most likely to burn the whole village down? For a modest organization a smart intern could probably put this together with Mathematica in a couple of weeks.",1354150761
4845712,comment,4843577,4843715,3,0,Firehed,,,"re: key length - Google Authenticator supports any length of key; Google happens to provide 80-bit (below the 128-bit minimum, per the HOTP spec!) keys for their own services. However, it does NOT support > 6 character output length, nor HMAC algorithm, nor (for TOTP) varying step or offset support.<p>re: 1 - By putting your MFA codes in a centralized (and synchronizable) location, you're losing much of the effectiveness of the second factor.  So ""when you install the Authy app on the new phone"" now there are two (or more) devices with access to the second factor. So when someone hacks your Authy account, all of your MFA tokens are compromised.<p>re: 2 - time sync problems are supposed to happen server-side, per the spec. As an implementor it's nice to not have to solve that problem, but you should be using a library for it regardless.  Also, please find me a phone (at least one with GPS) that doesn't keep remarkably accurate time. I'd be more worried about server clock drift.<p>re: 4 - Any company dealing with MFA secret keys should have a way to revoke them. It's conceptually as easy as nulling out a cell in a database. By putting everything with this service provider, you're increasing the amount of damage a single breach can do.<p>There are a lot of things wrong with Google's Authenticator app, but the fact that it doesn't sync with a remote service is a HUGE benefit to security. I like the idea of a ""revoke everything from this device"" button, but I don't like having all my security eggs in one basket.",1354150746

To begin with, how do we find out where the connection is broken (Is it the client socket or the proxy socket)? Bad connections have different reasons (in C terms: ECONNRESET, EWOULDBLOCK, ENETUNREACH, etc); are these specific reasons propagated verbatim?

4845683,comment,4843429,4845500,3,0,taliesinb,,,"> Units<p>If you read the blog post you'll see that the units support before 9 was 'tacked on' as a separate package. The units in 9 are much more extensive and flexible, and more importantly are integrated with other functions at a deep level. To give an example, if you find a solution to an equation that involves units, the solution will possess the correct units (and so on for curve fitting, etc..).<p>> Face detection<p>Having used both Mathematica and OpenCV for image processing, I challenge you to explain exactly how OpenCV goes ""far beyond"" Mathematica. Particularly in morphological processing and image component measurements, Mathematica is quite far ahead of OpenCV (in fact, Mathematica <i>bundles</i> OpenCV to do some of its image processing). However, OpenCV <i>does</i> expose more lower level stuff, and comes with some ML and object detection routines that Mathematica doesn't yet have. But the maximum speed at which you can prototype new algorithms in OpenCV is pretty darn painful.<p>> Spectrogram<p>The audio spectrogram is certainly not tacked on. Even doing a Short Time Fourier Transform yourself is far from easy (it is <i>not</i> equivalent to an ordinary FFT). Making it performant on large audio samples also requires some subsampling smarts. And doing a correct wavelet spectrogram is highly non-trivial, because the feature size depends on the frequency -- i.e. low frequencies have lower time resolution than higher frequencies.<p>> No new content.<p>Look at this list:<p><a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/SummaryOfNewFeaturesIn90.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/SummaryOfNewF...</a><p>There's a massive amount of new algorithmic content there.

University addresses expire an undetermined time after you graduate, so eventually when this happened to someone who had setup forwarding, it would trigger a horrendous forwarding loop of bounce notifications which would forward back and forth between our server and the university server and rather quickly fill up our (fairly small) mail partition and crash the whole machine.

Still, there is a thesis/antithesis/sythethis that is worth spelling out for HN'ers folowing along.<p>Infinite QE = False<p>Determinant QE = False<p>_________<p>Open-ended QE =~ True<p>Wait, wat, why?<p>The reason: The only way the Fed gets to where it wants is with (at a minimum) a credible threat of perpetual QE. The fed is trying to play the house at a casino.  It does not want a high-roller doubling down  all-in on Black at infinite repitition. That game goes to whoever lasts the longest at the table. The threat of perpetual QE needs to be credible to keep this type of speculation off the table. Only when it is clear that this has gone (ie, such bets are irrational on fundamentals) will it change its position.<p>So, in that sense, we should expect to see a reversion in policy that will make QE finite.  But that is different than saying that bets should be placed in as if we were in an environment of (tractably) finite QE (that would be bad advice--per above).  So to get to the state-space where your notion is true, you have to go through the state-space where the notion you dis-agree with is true.  But these are sequential, and the time that you are correct is iff and after the time that the other notion is correct first. And we are in that latter state-space now.<p>So housing prices are being supported by QE; QE is open-ended for the forseable future; At some stage this will revert but the half-life on a 30 year mortage is 15 yrs and we will have at least 8 years of QE so at least some (half or likely more) of the value of the housing market is (arguably but) correctely attributed to QE.<p>I think this is a fair/useful elucidation, but YMMV.",1354147485

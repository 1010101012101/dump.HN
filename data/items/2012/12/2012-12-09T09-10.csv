That was a mistake obviously as IBM was firmly there already. Same mistake Philips made in Europe with MSX and after that PC. The home market was fine, but making the systems very expensive for the business market was a crap strategy as you could buy an IBM compatible (with horrible graphics/sounds, but he, we are talking business here) for the same price as for instance the 8250 or 8280; why buy the latter?<p>That went on for Amiga/Atari as well; for the entertainment market (graphics, video, audio and games) these systems were excellent and great value; upping the price with the Amiga 2000 for instance and selling it 'for the business market' was a nail in the coffin.",1355046525

I have a lot; they are all broken except my Sun E450, SGI O2, Sparcstation 5s and Ultra 10. Almost none of the over 50 laptops, netbooks, pads  and desktops from '95 till now I have work perfectly. It depends in how far they do not work; most desktops do nothing (besides spin up the power), most laptops come on and start beeping. And I don't work in a builder yard; i'm  a programmer, so I didn't expose them to the elements. Computer museums and retro collectors depend a lot on the fixability of computers; all 80s stuff you could easily solder / repair yourself and it is worth it. In the 90s you still could, but after a certain time it gets annoying and people just 'buy new'.

In both cases, one uses XPath or (hopefully) CSS to locate an element and examine certain aspects of that element's state. A scraper is only different from a functional test in that a scraper is focused only on the state of nodes (potentially) containing human-readable content.  That, and a scraper saves the data it collects rather than discarding all data at the end of a test run.<p>Here's a very old Selenium 1.0 example that scrapes the full, rendered HTML of a page.

4894317,comment,4892190,4892793,7,0,mercurial,,,"> I suspect that the most important economic flows in Afghanistan are foreign aid and narcotics. The proceeds of the former are largely distributed via corruption, which requires co-operation, which is facilitated by the trust within tribal networks. Those the latter would be distributed accordingly to tribal / clan structures. I suspect ""the Taliban"" are basically a front for an extremely well organized drug cartel.<p>While the Talibans certainly rely on drug trafficking money to stay afloat nowadays, they had essentially wiped it out while they were ruling the country.<p>You make some good points. I'd like to mention a couple of additional things:
- Lack of institutions and the rule of law. As long as the administration, the police, the courts are easily bribed, why would you work along official channels? Your interest is better served by leveraging your clan's resources and bribing your way forward.
- Lack of a feeling of national unity. In particular, the 1996-2001 civil war in Afghanistan between the Northern Alliance and the predominantly Pashtoun, Pakistan-backed Talibans cannot have had a positive effect.",1355045582

It's really nice to hear from someone at HN who sees beyond the controversy caused by a totally different mental model, as you put it. I'm surprised I wasn't downmodded more aggressively.<p>I wouldn't have answered to this thread unless you had written these two comments of yours: HN certainly isn't the place for serious discussion about such topics and while I don't necessarily like it that way, that's just the way it is. But I sometimes keep fishing for different responses.<p>Now, anything related to gender, sex, gender roles, and the masculine and feminine parts of a person's psyche and spirit seems to be a touchy subject: add in a few feminist and antifeminist preconceptionsor just any politically correct oneto the mix and what you have is the mother of all can of worms.<p>It's virtually impossible to discuss those in a large group unless there's a predefined consensus that limits what can be said. All we probably <i>can agree with together</i> is that there's a difference between the masculine and feminine, but there are indefinite ways of how that could unfold into a discussion. Yet it's a very fundamental dynamic of life that you're bound to deal with one way or another, regardless of if you're a man or a woman.<p>Further, there are so many angles into this gender topic that it's hard if not impossible to establish a definitive model of how to present my thoughts on such a topic myself. And that doesn't fly well at HN: generally people who are thinking more aloud than asserting their final conclusions don't fare well on internet forums.<p>So, a fruitful conversation of the subject is probably only possible with at most two people who trust each other enough so that they're able to just reflect the other person's thoughts instead of trying to argue them out.<p>I know there are tens of thousands of different people on HN and most do have beliefs and attitudes that don't fit in the canned scientific-consensus impression most people present on HN.<p>There is a wealth of intelligent people here and I sometimes wonder what they think of things that can't be said here.",1355045335

COME ON.<p>Just think by yourself and accept you may not understand other people's thoughts before trying to 'fix' them.",1355043977

That's what I told myself. And I think this is the case in most lines of work. If you want to get ahead, you have to work <i>a great deal</i> harder than everyone else around you. Unless you happen to be exceptionally gifted and able to accomplish more than anyone else simply by showing up, it means that you really have to bust your ass continuously.<p>Generally this strategy and form of motivation has worked. I may not be the best at anything I'm doing, but I have accomplished a lot.",1355043941

Let me know how much fun the out-of-date documentation referencing syntax that no longer exists is.<p>If you ask about it or seek a redress you'll be told, ""we're not reeeaaaaaady"".<p>It's a state of affairs they've come to be quite comfortable with.<p>You're supposed to use Rust unless you're a Mozilla employee or intern, afaict.",1355043898

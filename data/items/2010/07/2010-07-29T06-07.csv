1556806,comment,1554432,1555698,0,0,ktsmith,,,"Well, tracking the kids through the grades is already done via cumulative files. Those contain grades, scores on standardized tests, records of disciplinary action, records of social services issues and that type of thing. All of that is being digitized now. In addition to all of that things like attendance are tracked with finer granularity as it's directly related to school funding. Then there's things like what period of time was the student on the free and reduced lunch program. How many meals did they receive during that time. That all gets tracked, again, for federal funding purposes. I'd have to pull out the Infinite Campus manual to get the details on some of the other things that are tracked, but I was quite surprised at all of it when I first saw it. Unfortunately in addition to their primary role as education, teachers are being asked to do more and more paper pushing and handling other duties pushed on them by politicians.<p>Some of the data they keep track of is useful. For example, it's very difficult to get kids into the special ed program these days. You have to put kids through various phases of testing, and each phase requires a different amount of time between them or different benchmarks for evaluation. Some of these systems can keep track of that so as a child moves through the grades each teacher can pick up where the last left off. Sometimes it can take a couple of years for a child to start receiving special education services which is unfortunate because at that point they are even further behind where they should be. This is the direct result of parents not wanting their kids singled out or alienated by being labeled special education. So in that case the tracking is probably a good thing since there are definitive records of what steps have been completed.",1280385243

But b2c is alive and well, even if it is in practice harder to get people to pay for longer term stuff.<p>You write 'web services', but actually you are selling something that is probably closer to software-as-a-service, where people use your product once or multiple times to get some instant effect.<p>37signals produces software that people actually build their business on. You are both 'toolmakers' but with vastly different audiences, however the 'toolmakers' link unites you enough that lots of these lessons apply back and forth.<p>If you were active in the 'social' space then it would be a lot harder - but still not impossible - to get your users to pay. If you were running a news outlet it would be harder still.<p>So, somewhere along the continuum you can place a dot and say 'this is me', there will be parties to the right of you that are able to make a more direct link between someone making or saving money and so they can make a 'harder' proposition, pay or leave.

I was dubious of the thing, feeling all superior and thinking that I was too smart to be changed by a small cheap book. I was wrong. i finished to book and quit, just like that, went cold turkey. no craving, no withdrawal feeling, nothing. I even did what you should never do which is to smoke just-the-one to see, didn't fall back. It amazes me that I never ever think about smoking. I just have these meta thoughts sometimes when I smell cigarettes about how I should feel something about it but don't.<p>It's a truly amazing book that read in a few hours and simply states very simple facts about smoking, the kind that you know but refuse to know. It force you to reconsider your smoking. That cigarette in the morning feels good? (no it doesn't) The one after lunch? (neither)... Step by step you naturally come to realize that every justification for smoking, all the fear of withdrawal, all the drama around smoking has no foundation.<p>You can just quit. Don't mess around with excuses, just quit. Next time you want to smoke just think ""Not worth it"" and forget it.

However, then in junior high to high school, those test scores then fall back in-line with the average.

1556787,comment,1556056,1556500,0,0,jasonz,,,"Thank you for the response - I very much appreciate the advice.<p>To answer some questions: I definitely want to be involved in the coding and technical aspects of a company.  If I had to pick it would be a startup over the lower risk/higher stability of an established business.  I would choose software over hardware due to the length of the development/approval cycle and the fact that I very much enjoy the creative process of coding.  I'm flexible about location.<p>I agree that there are a ton of great opportunities in medicine.  For the past 18 months I have been on clinical rotations and have quickly realized how poorly the current model of healthcare functions.  Far too much time is wasted on tasks that distract from providing better patient care.  These pain-points and inefficiencies could be easily addressed with simple software solutions.  I truly believe that the talent on HN could change the way medicine is practiced.  We could decrease the number of deaths due to mistakes (estimated ~100,000/year) and increase doctor/patient satisfaction.<p>I find the current enterprise software used in the hospital to be the most frustrating.  The modern patient is a data-generating machine, yet we still use outdated programs to manage these patients.  It's not customized to the clinical situation.  It's ugly.  It's unintuitive and difficult to use.<p>I'm interested in improving healthcare from a tech perspective.  Providing better analysis and visualization of data.  Creating a collection of tools that make everyone's job in the hospital easier.  From my perspective there are a bunch of situations where the solution is an adaptation/translation of an established technology from outside the hospital.<p>3 examples - (I have a huge list):<p>1. a twitter/yammer/googlewave-like application that would be patient-centric and keep the whole healthcare team up to date on the management of the patient (a new member to the team could easily be brought up to speed on a patient)<p>2. a panic status board application for the inpatient consult service (once I call the consult I have absolutely no idea where they are in the proces - sometimes for days)<p>3. a stackoverflow/wiki on location-specific hospital logistics and information (I can never remember all the details of ordering a rare test/procedure - plus it would accelerate the learning curve for the new residents/staff each year)<p>ps - as for your assessment of doctor's egos, you're definitely correct (you should see what happens when you put 20 or 30 in a room together).",1280384470

Are you able to save something so you can return to it later?<p>There are lots of bookmark lets that have nothing to do with bookmarking. It's just a way to execute some JavaScript in the context of a page.<p>Most of the sites there aren't social bookmarking, either.

Your assertion that advertising in other media makes them a failure is, well, just that; an assertion.  I don't have any numbers on the financials of the companies, but the general consensus of people that I know is that OKCupid is a fine place to waste time, but that if you really want to meet people you need to go to the pay sites (precisely because the financial barrier-to-entry keeps away all the people who aren't really interested in dating).",1280383306

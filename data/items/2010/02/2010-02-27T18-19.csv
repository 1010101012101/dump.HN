However, I think he made a few very insightful points:<p>1) Understanding psychological factors is extremely powerful, and probably even more important than good game design. i.e. WoW isn't successful because of art design and gameplay, it's successful because some people find ""the grind"" very addicting. Farmville isn't successful because a videogame about farm animals is fun, it's successful because it integrates with your Facebook friends.<p>1b) Discovering, understanding and exploiting new psychological factors is extremely profitable.<p>2) The rest of the world has a lot to learn from game design on how to optimize products to take advantage of these factors.<p>I agree with you that gamers are hooked on the point systems more than everyone else, but I disagree that it's a binary system. Like alcohol, nicotine, and gambling, it probably affects everyone to differing degrees.<p>The definition of gamers has had to change a lot over the last decade. When I was a kid, only nerdy kids played games. Now those gamers are fathers. Now mothers and grandmothers play farmville / scrabble / bejeweled. Even if you're right that this only affects gamers, the percentage of the population that are classified gamers is growing.<p>With hundreds of millions of potential customers, even small changes are extremely profitable.<p>Take Starbucks. If they convince one new customer to make starbucks part of their morning routine, that has an expected value of like $1000/year. I heard they started offering coupons to people in the morning, that are only valid if they come back later that day. If Starbucks figures out to apply the Farmville secret sauce, watch out.",1267297127

According to Wikipedia, psychopaths ""they take what they want and do as they please, violating social norms and expectations without guilt or remorse"".  In other words, they do whatever the heck they want, social norms be damned.<p>Many meat-eaters that I know are meat-eaters <i>because</i> they are very much attuned to social norms.  They intuitively know that breaking from the common belief that animals are objects could threaten their socialization, which can add to their reluctance to entertain vegetarian ideas.<p>But I'm glad that you brought up the concept of psychopathy, because anyone who reads up on factory farming would realize that people who do that to animals are not mentally healthy.  It's like the 99% of us who aren't psychopaths have delegated the messy work of factory farming to the 1% of us that are psychopaths.",1267296938

People justify eating meat because it would be a big sacrifice, for them personally, to go without it, and I will bet in 99% of cases they do not care for the the zoos/sports they wish to eliminate.

1155592,comment,1154088,1155529,0,0,jeromec,,,"I didn't suggest the stock market is the economy, but it is an important cog within our connected financial system. The key to my argument is in my first sentence about psychology. Did you read the WSJ article I linked to? Another quote from Buffet in the article: <i>""I felt that this is something like I've never seen before, and the American public and Congress don't fully understand the gravity of the problem""</i> General Motors needed to be rescued, and there are millions out of work, yet these items have little association with Bear Sterns, AIG, Wall St. etc., the financial institutions where the damage shook the pillars of our economy which rests upon the financial system and the dollar. The point being things are connected; significant trouble in one area knocks into the other, and you get a domino effect. The dollar is no longer backed by anything but promises, and people accept it because of our superior position as an economic and world power - even with all our escalating debt. However, we are not invincible (as Rome was not) and can experience a dollar crash if, as I said, enough people begin to think the dollar based system will not survive due to stress load (debt for bailouts/stimulus, future medicare). It's true the dollar has been fairly consistent for about a decade, and that's because our standing in the world has remained so - people still die to get in. However, a truer measure of faith in the dollar is the price of gold 10 years ago vs. today - $280 vs. $1080 respectively.",1267294558

The world doesn't neatly fit into our tidy little concepts of morality.<p>However, ignore the edge cases and there isn't so much ambiguity.  Take the average American sitting down to a meal--why does he choose to eat beef?  Typically it is out of habit or to please the palate.  In the typical case, this act is harmful to the health of this person.  This act also ends the life of a sentient being whose brain is developed enough to experience pain, emotions, and even develop social relationships.  I don't see much ethical gray area here:  a desire to please the palate would be trumped by another sentient being's desire to continue living and live free of pain and suffering.<p>Also, I doubt you would consistently hold to this position: ""realize the ambiguity, complexity and downright contradictions that are endemic to our existence"" if you were on the receiving end of the pain and suffering.  If someone kidnapped your daughter and prostituted her out, for example, I doubt that you would find comfort in the fact that life is ""ambiguous and complex"".",1267294364

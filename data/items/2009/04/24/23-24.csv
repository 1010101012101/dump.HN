578378,comment,578272,578272,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"I'm sure you'll get plenty of comments on hacker fiction, so here's some ""business"" fiction:<p>* ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" by Tom Wolfe.  The classic novel of 80s Wall Street at its peak.<p>* ""American Psycho"" by Bret Easton Ellis.  A pretty terrifying picture of greed and excess, again on 80s Wall Street.  If you've seen the movie, you know what to expect -- only in greater detail.<p>* ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ayn Rand.  Some people hate it, but others find it an inspirational novel.  The heroes are driven, smart, competitive entrepreneurs; the antagonists are greedy, pilfering government regulators.  Whether or not you like this will probably depend on your pre-existing ideological preference.<p>I'm sure there are others that I'm forgetting...",1240616940

I started my career in a TV production (part-time CG programmer), and still get projects with some connection to TV time to time.   TV industry itself supports quite a few jobs, and the industry depends on those who spend long hours watching TV.<p>That won't be an excuse to creating dumb content just to make people addict, but suppose all the people stop spending time on passive entertainment and spend it on ""productive"" activity instead, who will consume their ""products""?

Planes and bombs took a long time to deliver before WWII, but we needed them so badly that we converted factories and started cranking them out with remarkable efficiency.<p>Granted, it would be harder to do that without a proper power grid, but I sometimes wonder if people misjudge the ingenuity of our collective society in the face of monumental disaster.",1240616858

That's one thing I'm trying to figure out because I believe fields like SNA, sociophysics, complex systems, etc. can help us understand how to build better, more interesting, and more sustainable social networks -- but AFAIK there's no communication between the people forging new social networks and the people researching them.<p>But I do know this: Facebook has focused on density from very early on, which is a key factor in the threshold model.  Their strategy has always been depth first, as opposed to many FB apps, which I think are breadth first.  That is, they go viral, but they spread far and wide without spending time building sufficient density to become self-sustainable.<p>There's some formula like engagement = density*activity buried in there that I can't quite pull out.",1240616290

No problem!'<p>I think one of the big reasons that the Semitic scripts in general haven't caught on in western design is that they tend to be very 'dense', particularly the calligraphy. It's easy to point to a Kanji symbol and say 'Ohh that's Kaze, that represents Wind', whereas Arabic calligraphy tends to look like just a cursive jumble without knowledge of the language. Couple this with the strong capacity to offend by including the wrong religious symbolism, and you have a recipe for disaster without considerable special knowledge.<p>I'm a pretty quick transliterator of Arabic, but some of the Calligraphy (and, for that matter, many modern squared out fonts) is still quite challenging. Hopefully as the Arab world as a whole grows wealthier (by Median not Average) the design tools will catch up and allow for more of this stuff to filter in to the western design world.",1240616290

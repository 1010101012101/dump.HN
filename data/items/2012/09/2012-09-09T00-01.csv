My primary background is in javascript and I occasionally pop on and look for questions to answer to help other folks out. However, I find most of the questions being asked not necessarily being questions, but more statements. Among the actual questions, they are more about this jquery plugin or that ASP.net thing. I wish that SO had better enforcement of <i>how</i> questions are submitted, along with quality.<p>My other problem at the moment is that I am working on some objective-c stuff and SO is mostly useless for finding answers. Being new to the language and the APIs, I am sometimes lost and trying to get my bearings. A few questions I've submitted have either been closed or ignored. Only one really got a good answer, and when I tracked down the author I found he is very skilled and helps out lots of people.

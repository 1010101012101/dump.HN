Also, plain old C could possibly stand in for the assembly, especially if you were mostly using it ""portable assembly"" style instead of relying mostly on libraries.<p>For what it's worth the list I had mind originally was something like:<p><pre><code>   * C, for low-level procedural and machine-awareness
   * Ruby, for high-level procedural and OOP (plus scripty perl-isms)
   * Scheme, for distilled lisp-iness without distracting details
   * Haskell, for HM static typing and functional purity

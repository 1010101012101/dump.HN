Further, for the general reader, there is the added cost of having to subscribe, or at the very least check, more news sources to get the same amount of information as you would in a world without exclusives.  There is also the delay before other publications start picking up the story and we get competing points of view.  To me as a consumer, it looks like an overall decrease in value.  I understand that it doesn't look that way to a publisher.<p>About my second sentence - I was imagining a story with little newsworthiness, as this is one extreme of your ""only criteria"".  If a publisher is more likely to publish this story because of an exclusive, which is what you seem to be saying, then newsworthiness isn't the only criteria.<p>I did not mean to be combative or demand an answer from you - my apologies if I came off that way.

Now, let's say you put your cell phone to your ear and start firing off ~uncountable photons, each of which are in the GHz range.<p>Billions upon billions of these photons will enter your brain. Imagine - if they were all energetic enough to be ionizing, then you would be experiencing strand breaks all the time while talking on your phone! But in fact, recall our (arbitrary) cutoff of 1 keV required to break a strand. Well, a 1.7 GHz phone is only emitting photons with an energy of around 7 micro eV. Such photons would be billions (10^9) of times too weak to cause a strand break.<p>Recall also that photonic energy is generally not additive. Think about pebbles being thrown at you. A 1-ounce pebble hitting you in the chest doesn't hurt. 160 1-ounce pebbles hitting you in the chest over the course of a few seconds might be annoying, but it's nothing like having a 10-pound rock thrown at your chest. Likewise, trillions of low-energy particles bombarding your DNA doesn't phase it at all.<p>Similarly, whereas one photon with 1 keV (again, that number is for sake of argument) might break your DNA, billions of photons with 0.1 keV wouldn't do a thing. This is why it is an odd proposition that low-energy, non-ionizing cell phone radiation should cause cancer.<p>As an aside, the pebble throwing analogy leads to one other possibility: imagine that all 160 pebbles hit your chest at precisely the same moment (to an accuracy of nanoseconds) at nearly exactly the same place. It would certainly feel as if you had been struck by a 10 pound rock. Likewise, if two photons hit the precise same place at precisely the same time, they will impart equivalent energy of one photon with double their frequency. This is rare, and at any rate the energy of one cell phone photon is so low that two together is still effectively nothing, as well.",1265433043

There is no evidence that life has existed in the past on Mars.  If there were, that would be fantastic, and many people believe such evidence will be forthcoming, but as of right now, there is none that is accepted in the mainstream.<p>As to your other point, the very fact that life on Earth has come close to extinction, and yet survived, so very many times indicates that there is an empirical (not theoretical) basis for my claim that life (in some form) tends to bounce back.  The mechanism is the fact that bacterial and archael life forms live deep within insulated areas of Earth's crust and retain relatively (geologically speaking) modern genes for traits such as aerobic respiration.  Survivorship bias does not imply that in some situations there are no survivors, that is a misapplication of the idea.<p>Now, it's certainly possible that life could be extinguished in a short geologic time span, that I don't refute.  And of course, in around a billion years the sun's total radiative output will make life all but impossible on Earth's surface.  But in the mean time, evidence suggests life is incredibly hardy.<p>I suspect, anyway, that we are talking at cross-purposes.  The topic was sustainability vis a vis human activity.  You rightly point out that we are not in total control, that things can go awry without our intervention.  Nature is indeed a chaotic system.  However, I suspect you do not disagree that we can choose to avoid certain paths that would inevitably lead to our own destruction.  We probably can't avoid all of them, as we are not omniscient, but my main point is that it behooves us to think about it, and to attempt to act responsibly, not in a sense of maintaining the natural state of the world as a static equilibrium, but merely to survive as best we understand how.",1297994395
2233849,comment,2233815,2233815,0,0,jhancock,,,"Distribute equity to co-founders from day-1 or close enough to when the company has a small value.  Its very legit to justify a small value of say $1000 (total share value) if you have no income and no investment yet without regard to when you incorporated.  Equity comes with reverse vesting params.  Each year, you vest 1/3 shares or tie vesting to hours worked, whatever fits...attach other params to taste, like ""for-cause"" termination, accelerated vesting for acquisition, etc.  Bottom line is the shares are transferred prior to the company having much value...Whatever  doesn't get vested gets sold back at the original purchase price (pennies to hundreds of dollars, small change)...tax problems gone.<p>I am not a lawyer.  This is a summary of what a lawyer setup for a past company of mine.  This stock structure worked well and passed many rounds of due diligence from subsequent investors.",1297994375

2233831,comment,2233620,2233661,0,0,Smerity,,,"I think for many personal websites Jekyll[1] style static website generation is going to become very popular. Previously you were always limited by a few dynamic parts of your site such as comments, newsletter registration and questionnaires but now between services like Disqus, MailChimp and Google Docs, you really don't need to pay for any of that anymore. All the dynamic parts of your site are external.<p>The only cost now is hosting the website at S3 and those costs are substantially lower than competitors. NearlyFreeSpeech[2] is the closest web host to S3 that I can think of and their prices for storage are $10/GB ($0.01 per megabyte month) whilst S3 starts at $0.140 per GB.
If your site gets hit incredibly heavily Amazon S3 will also handle the load transparently. If you find that your site is becoming popular in Europe or Asia than it's also supremely easy to push your site from S3 to CloudFront.<p>I wonder how far you can take this though? How complex a site can you set up using only static hosting and external dynamic services like Disqus, MailChimp and Docs?<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki</a>

2233775,comment,2233090,2233090,0,0,calbear81,,,"In the spirit of sharing, I did have something similar to the Culinary Education Site mocked up for a while.  The idea was to combine techniques/instruction with a recipe site in a simple multi-column layout.<p>Imagine the ingredients and steps on one panel.  Clicking on any ingredient or any step would pull in dynamic content onto the right ""content panel"".  This requires that the recipes use standardized naming conventions + measurement units and we would handle this by making a guided recipe builder.  The author of the recipe would be able to add in notes that would show up when you click on an ingredient/step.<p>Why is this any different than every recipe site out there?  Right now, recipe sites, especially the most visited ones, mainly reproduce plain text and try to build some interactivity by finding words to trigger links against like ""carrot"".  Even when you have more information, the sites are designed to open up new windows so you end up having 20 windows open by the time you finish the recipe.  In a ""twitter-like"" layout, you will NEVER leave the recipe page. The ingredients and steps are always visible and all content loads into the content pane.<p>The types of content would include vetted UGC videos, photos/illustrations, or helpful tips like ""shortcuts"" or ""substitutions"".  Of course, this is also where users comments would show up.  This is where I really had the idea to try and do this.. I was on a recipe site and a popular recipe had over 200 comments.. MOST of the comments related to specific ingredients or steps but they were organized chronologically which is absolutely NOT logical at all.  I asked myself why the comments weren't attached to specific ingredients/instructions and thus this idea.<p>I'm sure someone here will tell me it's been done, so please share any links if it has because I couldn't fine any that did it well enough to satisfy what I had in mind.",1297992691

The incompleteness theorems basically say, ""if you have a logical system that includes Peano arithmetic, even if the theory is consistent, it will be an incomplete system.""  Also, ""if you're trying to show that said system is consistent within the system, then you have an inconsistent system.""  These statements drop the Hilbert program to a dead halt.<p>2. I'm not talking about a perfect theorem proving system.  However, what I _am_ saying is that you still need humans to verify the results - we do have automatic theorem provers already, but we still need to make sure that the steps are logical.  Not only that, but the theorem needs to connote something useful.  Also, we tend to use axioms that we can't say are consistent within the system (for instance, the axiom of choice; yet, mathematicians use it like candy in order to show useful results in analysis, and weird, unintuitive results in topology [slicing a sphere and producing two spheres with the same volume.])  I understand that the article is saying, ""yes, such a proof produced by a computer still needs to be independently verified.""  To be honest, I think a system that could make mistakes and whatnot is not necessarily what people would want to see - reason being that mathematicians probably have not much trouble trying to figure out the larger details and overall plan of attack.<p>3. The reason why I'm doubtful that we'd ever see such an AI for proving math statements is because the entire enterprise is still very much a creative one - you not only have to generate the logical forms somehow, but also figure out whether it gets you closer to your goal or not.  I suppose you could have some sort of heuristic that could show that a generated theorem or lemma could in fact get you closer to your goal, but my god, math is filled with so many potholes and garden paths that could lead one astray.<p>Don't get me wrong, it'd be awesome to see such a system - however, I'm very doubtful that such a system could ever be created, and if it is created, that it'd be actually useful to practicing mathematicians.",1297992169

2233704,comment,2232359,2232359,0,0,ezyang,,,"Automated proof tools are already causing a headache for mathematicians. The four color theorem was proved by breaking the problem down into 1,936 cases, and then proved each of the individually.  This story has a happy ending: the result is now fairly well accepted and there have been numerous steps in simplifying the proof.<p>However, other automated proofs have not been so lucky: Hale's proof of the Kepler Conjecture was 300 pages of mathematics and 40,000 lines of supporting computer code, and the referees of the paper tried four years to understand it (they even set up a seminar series for all of the prerequisite material to understand the proof) before letting the authors know that they were unable to verify the correctness of the proof because they ""ran out of energy to devote to the problem."" (The Annals of Mathematics henceforth edited their rules to disallow submission of computer programs.) The Flyspeck project is to, well, ask a program to verify the correctness of the proof. Ah, the times we live in.",1297991225

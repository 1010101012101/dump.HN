MacMillan is trying to force them to sell ebooks at the same price as every other ebook retailer.  Let's see, what would we call that...  How about price fixing?  --Something generally considered bad for the consumer.<p>Amazon is doing exactly what any other business with bargaining power would do.  And really, Amazon is doing what customers want - they're trying to keep prices down.  So really, who should consumers be mad at - Amazon for working to keep prices lower, or MacMillan for trying to prevent competition in the market and make sure their books are being sold for the highest price possible?",1264949842

And how they're willing to use the latter, but made a big deal about how the research of their critics wasn't peer reviewed or in a blessed journal ... when they were conspiring to arrange just that outcome.<p>I think it's clear where the real selection bias is.<p>Look, the essence of science (that doesn't first start with experimental data) is that you put forward a theory, marshal evidence in its favor and answer all the criticism and evidence not in its favor.  If you hide, obfuscate or destroy your evidence and refuse to answer your critics <i>you aren't doing science</i>.",1264949725
1090511,comment,1090361,1090445,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I would point out that, if I owned a Kindle, and yesterday I could buy a given book, but today I log in and find that said book isn't available anymore because the vendor of my Kindle is flexing their monopoly power, I'm not sure how happy I would be.<p>Now, let's try a metaphor. It will be a little clunky, since the situation isn't the same. But go with it for a second.<p>I see that Bingo Card Creator sells for $29.95. That seems awfully high. [1]<p>But suppose I've got my hands on the channel through which 50% of Bingo Card Creator's sales are flowing. (Perhaps I'm Google, and I both (a) run AdSense and (b) own a lot of the pipes down which your content flows.) And I'm starting up an app store. My deal for you is: You will license Bingo Card Creator to me for republishing at my app store, where all apps cost $19.95 flat rate. If you refuse, I'll cut off all the ads and distribution that connect you to over half of your customer base, and we'll see how long you can afford to defy me while your cash flow has been cut in half.<p>Of course, if you say yes to $19.95, your customers will be very happy. They will flock to my app store where the prices are lowest. Soon 75% of your customers will arrive through my channel. At which point I might decide to lower the price on your app to $9.95, flat rate.<p>I'm assuming that there is a price point below which you will go out of business, and below which your replacements will go out of business (even if I hire the cheapest labor I can find, and cut QA to the bone). You may prefer not to explore exactly where that point is, if only because you like producing quality products, and because it's nice to not be one temporary sales slump away from bankruptcy. But, thanks to my grip on your distribution channel, we will now perform that experiment, on my schedule and my terms.<p>Why hasn't this happened more often in web software? Perhaps because no monopoly controls a sufficient portion of the network. Perhaps because those with the power are scared of anti-monopolist legislation (which, in this context, we tend to call ""net neutrality laws"") and don't want to provoke anyone. Perhaps because software-industry mavens are very well practiced at picking up their operations and moving to a different channel literally overnight. Perhaps because software has a huge profit margin compared to print books, which provides healthy margin for emergencies. Perhaps because we've been lucky so far. And perhaps because, if and when Google does destroy entire industries by tweaking a bit in AdSense, they tend to be industries we don't like very much, and/or it tends to stay under the radar. [2]<p>My sense is that this moment isn't so much about publishers and authors trying to stave off the arrival of the internet. It's about an attempt to stave off a monopolist's control of their pricing and distribution.<p>---<p>[1] To a cheapskate. Cheapskates think all prices are high. People complain about high prices on the iPhone App Store, for god's sake.<p>[2] Note: I haven't seen any credible evidence that this actually happens, although people do complain about it now and then.",1264949547

1090495,comment,1090043,1090043,0,0,fexl,,,"Here is a more flexible functional representation of numerals, courtesy Steensgaard-Madsen [1989], but written in Fexl:<p><pre><code>  \zero = (\zero\succ zero)
  \succ = (\n \zero\succ succ n)
</code></pre>
This delays the binding of the handler functions (zero and succ) until each step instead of deciding once way up at the top.<p>Addition is easy:<p><pre><code>  \add = (\x\y x y \p succ (add p y))
</code></pre>
As is multiplication:<p><pre><code>  \mul = (\x\y x 0 \p add y (mul p y))
</code></pre>
Now unary notation is fine for some things, but when I'm using arbitrarily large numbers in Fexl I use a binary notation (lists of bits), with representations as follows:<p><pre><code>  []    = 0
  [F|N] = 2*N   (where N != 0)
  [T|N] = 2*N+1
</code></pre>
In that notation addition is a little harder but not too bad:<p><pre><code>  \add = (\x\y x y \xb\xn y x \yb\yn
      \z=(add xn yn)
      xb
          (yb [F,T|z] [T|z])
          (yb [T|z] [F|z]))
</code></pre>
Multiplication is:<p><pre><code>  \twice = (\x x [] \_\_ [F|x])

  \mul = (\x\y x y \xb\xn y x \yb\yn
      \z=(twice; mul xn yn)
      xb
          (yb [T|add xn; add yn z] [F|add yn z])
          (yb [F|add xn z] [F|z]))
</code></pre>
[The ';' you see there is the Fexl ""right-pivot"" operator, a syntactic device for avoiding right-nesting.  For example, (add 1; add 2; add 3; 0) is a shorthand for (add 1 (add 2 (add 3 0))).  Also the notation [x|y] is a shorthand for (cons x y), where cons = (\head\tail \null\cons cons head tail).]<p>You can also harness the full power of the <i>computable numbers</i>, which is how you do the so-called ""real"" numbers on a physical computing device.  A computable number is a pair of lists of bits (T or F).  One list is the integer part and the other is the fractional part.  The fractional part can be infinite, allowing exact representation of numbers like pi and e.  (Come to think of it you could  have an infinite integer part as well, which might actually be useful somehow.)<p>If you're careful to avoid non-termination you can do useful work with lazily evaluated computable numbers.  Something like (add pi e) will work just fine and give you an exact result to any number of places you desire.  On the other hand (equal pi pi) will loop forever, searching futilely for two bits which disagree.  But when you're looking for ""close enough"" you can just apply (clip 20) to the numbers and then compare them.",1264948499

Even narrowing the category to smart phones doesn't really make enough of a difference for your point to be valid. Sure, there are plenty of people out there that have iPhones, but there's also people out there with phones running Android and PalmOS. There's people with Blackberry's and WinMos.

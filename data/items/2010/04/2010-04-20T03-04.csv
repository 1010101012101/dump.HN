The fact that it was later found and he was publicly humiliated shouldn't change anything in this case - they already knew it was lost and they knew this situation was a real possibility. If they hadn't fired him yet, I don't see how it makes sense to fire him now that someone found and published it. It's not like he could control who happened to find it.",1271735999

Either of those can be profitable, but nobody's going to sell a $10+ App to an appreciable fraction of iPhone/iTouch/iPad users.<p>The high-volume cheap apps (free to $10) are for the general public, and in that area, the blog post is correct - Apple is mostly interested in competition resulting in cheap and good general-interest apps, because it enhances ""there's an App for that"".<p>If you want to sell a $50+ iPhone app, you need to look at niche fields.  There's a bar exam prep app for $1000[1], and one of the apps demo'd before the App store launch.  In general, the really expensive iPhone apps add a killer-app feature - a feature that justifies buying the iPhone itself.  Like the ""check your security cameras while patrolling""[2] app, or the ""every medical and pharmacological reference ever written in the palm of your hand and instantly searchable"" app (#8 on the list in [2]) or the ""control your multi-thousand-dollar home automation system"" app from ROSIE[3].  These types of Apps literally sell iPhones by themselves.  I mean, the tuning forks you need to tune a high-end piano cost $450[4], so a $300 app which is a million times easier to use is a no-brainer if you're a piano repairman or performer.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.edibleapple.com/bar-exam-preparation-app-for-the-iphone-now-available-for-1000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edibleapple.com/bar-exam-preparation-app-for-the-...</a>

Nobody said you had to write it before thinking about edge cases!  The idea is to think about the edge cases and incorporate that thinking into the code before you actually test the code--whether you can be--actually whether you know the steps to be--that thorough in your head.<p>One way to think about edge cases, of course, is to write the test code before the function.  But after writing the tests, try writing the function correctly before testing it.<p>Of course, one of the potential bugs in binary search doesn't occur to people before they write and then try it.

No one would leave their identity on the device if they had personally conspired to sell it on the black market. I don't think it's that big of a deal. If the device was being field tested Apple was accepting the risk of theft/loss.

I was never intimidated by male professors and TAs and lab partners; I saw them as programmers first.  I never lacked for role models and heroes because it never occurred to me to ask that they be women.  I never had any requirements beyond 'great hacker'.<p>What I did find frustrating was the obsequious encouragement to stay.  Extra scholarships I qualified for.  My pick of lab partners.  Professional societies just for women.  The expectation that enrolling or hiring me would make some bean counter somewhere very happy.<p>It's frustrating because it leaves me wondering if I'm held to a lower standard.  Would my work actually stand out if I weren't a woman?  When people tell me I've done a good job, are they silently adding, "". . . for a girl"" ?  Am I going to get upvotes on this comment just for being a woman, and not necessarily for being insightful?<p>Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of people trying to artificially import women into the field is that sometimes they succeed.  There were always women who were there because they got extra attention and extra help.  Women who wouldn't shut up about what it was like to be a developer and -- holy crap -- a woman!  At the same time!  It was, like, worth running a whole blog about!<p>The more women like that there were running around, the harder I felt I had to work to differentiate myself from them.  I don't want to be ""second rate, but that's okay because thank God somebody got a woman to stick around.""  I don't want to be, ""wow, that's awesome work and--HEY IT'S A WOMAN, THIS IS FRONT PAGE MATERIAL!""  I want to do first rate work and be criticized and compete and fight obscurity right along with everyone else.<p>There aren't many women in tech.  And there are even fewer of them in the really upper echelons.  Then again, that's true in general.  Whatever the reason, women in tough, competitive fields are rare, and the tougher and more competitive and more elite it gets, the rarer they are.  I don't know why that is.  Frankly, I don't care.  It's not a justification for hamstringing the women who are the exceptions--and no one throughout history has ever said it is.  But treating it like a problem just <i>makes</i> problems for people like me.<p>Seriously, just let people do what they want to do and be who they want to be and stop <i>worrying</i> about why they choose what they choose.",1271732689

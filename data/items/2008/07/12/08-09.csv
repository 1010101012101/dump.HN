It's an ages old tactic, and one that's been considered fair game forever. A corporation out to make profits is foolish to not use it where possible.<p>You can't ever stop someone from switching to cheaper or free alternatives. You can only make your product so good (if only through legacy support) that the cost of switching is higher than the cost of buying your product. This, again, is neither new nor unfair.<p>Abusing near-monopolies (which MS did) is unfair, but has nothing to do with proprietary vs. free. It's perfectly possible to have proprietary software without that. It's like the difference between drinking sensibly and drinking and driving.",1215852297

244410,story,,,10,17,Raphael,"Ask YC: Is there a market for 2D virtual worlds?",,"So the hot trend this month is 3D virtual worlds that are embeddable on web pages, namely Vivaty and Lively. As someone currently working on a 2D virtual world, naturally I was a bit concerned. Luckily, these offerings are half-baked, spotty in platform availability and customization. However, it may only be weeks before these issues are cleared up. Their mere existence is a real motivator for me to release.<p>So, is there a market for 2D virtual worlds that span the web? And what types of people would choose 2D over 3D? How do I cater to them?",1215851735

244406,comment,244221,244310,0,0,rsheridan6,,,"a) Genes are not expressed the same way in men and women.  To oversimplify a little, if a gene is only activated in the presence of male levels of testosterone, it will not be expressed in women.  In the long run, natural selection hooks up genes that are beneficial in men and harmful in women to testosterone-sensitive gene promoters, though this may take a long time, and in the meantime you may end up with women with deleterious traits that were beneficial for their fathers.<p>While we're at it, similar mechanisms account for the difference between a neuron and a muscle fiber, which share identical genomes.<p>b) A very successful man can end up with hundreds of concubines and children.  A significant percentage of Asians are direct descendents of Genghis Khan, and there was a King Niall in Ulster who is said to be an ancestor of 25% of the men in Northwest Ireland.  Monogamy somewhat limits this in our culture, but most people for most of the time humans have existed have been polygynous.  For a woman, this is impossible - she can have a dozen or so babies at best.",1215851318

244404,comment,244221,244316,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Men have always been encouraged to have sex with a lot of different partners, not to sire children with them. (Children were, of course, the reason that men developed the urge, but the urge stands separately, as shown by the fact that men do not decrease their mating habits when there is no chance of pregnancy.) That's clearly still the case in modern society. Spend 10 minutes in a high school locker room and you'll see that.<p>Darwinian theories about women being wired differently than men are perpetuated because science backs them up. We don't know exactly how, or how much of the difference is genetic vs. cultural, but it's just a reality that men and women have different motivations, aptitudes, etc.<p>Nobody would argue that evolution has made us different physically. Men are much stronger and better coordinated. Women are more able to bear pain and often have stronger senses of smell and taste. Why would it not stand to reason that evolution might make each sex better at some mental tasks than the other, just as it has physical? It's not sexist to point out that male weight-lifters are able to bench more because men have been designed by evolution to be stronger. Why is it sexist to say we show up more frequently in science departments because we have also been designed by evolution to be better at math?<p>Sexism is not believing that one sex is different than another, it's believing that those differences make it inferior.",1215851045

(I'd define the characteristics that drive one to start up differently, but you get the picture. However you define it, it may be that fewer women have those characteristics). \na) ok. undoubtedly a part.\nb) Perhaps you have cause and effect bakcwards. Perhaps women with fewer kids are more likely to become high status. Perhaps both are just correlated and caused by some other factor.<p>And Hillary Clinton is getting a lot of the treatment she is now because her refusal to concede for a long time when it was clear that Obama would be the nominee has been potentially very destructive to her party.

244399,comment,244221,244382,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"The easiest way to prove something is genetic rather than cultural is to examine different cultures throughout the world, especially isolated ones like pygmies or aborigines.<p>The paradigm of man as provider and woman as nurturer, and the mating ramifications of that (i.e. women preferring men who are able to provide, which most closely translates in our society to wealth, and men preferring women more fit to raise children, which in our society most closely translates to healthy appearance) are virtually universal.<p>That would strongly suggest that it is genetic rather than cultural.",1215850101

JS <i>is</i> the new BASIC - or <i>a</i> new BASIC, anyway - but it is harder to tell because the audience is more diffuse, and mixed up with so many other audiences.<p>In the earliest days of PCs it was easy to spot the BASIC programmers: most people who owned a PC learned a little. What else was there to do with it? And computers were expensive, so odds were that if you owned one you were pretty fond of computers.<p>Now the situation is like that in music: we are in a golden age of programming, but it is hard to appreciate because it is so diffuse and varied: The equivalent of the big arena rock show isn't there.",1279976380

I was a co-op during college at this company that made 4 wheel drive systems and they were working on an electronically controlled transfer case.<p>I was given the task of importing raw data captured at the test track into very uninformative spreadsheets.  I wrote macros to generate charts presenting all the different parameters.  Also very uninformative.<p>I came up with a much better way to present the data using BASIC.  I drew a picture of a car with 4 wheels.  The front wheels turned and the rear wheels flashed when they lost traction.  I had a bar graph showing for the engine and a transfer case that flashed when power shifted to the front end.  You could vary the speed, run it in a loop and even run it backward.<p>With this you could actually see the wheels turning under power starting to break loose and system responding to correct it.  Just one problem when they got it to the test track and looked at data immediately after a test instead of weeks later:  The steering rack actually turns in the opposite direction that the wheels do, so the wheels turned in the wrong direction!<p>Thanks, BASIC.  good times :-)",1279974143

A prosecutor can credibly threaten a middle-aged man that he will die in a cell unless he gives evidence against his boss. This is unfair, complains Harvey Silverglate, the author of “Three Felonies a Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent”. If a defence lawyer offers a witness money to testify that his client is innocent, that is bribery.

However, if you're poor then you might just end up serving more than 7 years as an <i>under trial</i> before your court day. It doesn't matter if you're innocent or guilty if you're poor. If you're arrested you have to serve time as an under trial due to the byzantine system.<p>I wish there were some accurate up to date statistics I could link to, but the inaccurate ones themselves are quite telling (<a href=""http://ncrb.nic.in/PSI2007/prison2007.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ncrb.nic.in/PSI2007/prison2007.htm</a>). More than 54245 people were imprisoned for being under trial in 2007. The irony is that if you're well-connected then you don't even need to spend your time in jail if convicted. The press has a ball with such cases and they are decreasing, but they still exist.<p>On the other hand, I think that a country's justice system is a mirror of the society in which it operates. My real father was a lawyer in Germany and he once explained to me just how different the legal systems of different nations are and just how intertwined they are with the political climate of a country (he's currently doing his PhD on immigration and its socio-economic side-effects which include crime, education etc).<p>Perhaps, the rise of convictions in the US is a result of a society that wants results fast.Without doubt those tax dollars would reap higher returns if they are wisely invested in programs that benefit those in poverty. The ghettos are the root of a lot of crime, and if their conditions are improved and they're given a lifeline then slowly over time things will change. The problem is that just like in India it is far more impressive to be ""tough on crime"", than to work at a solution that will take longer than your term in office to give returns.<p>The same would apply to a lot of other debates. It is so easy to apply a quick-fix, but so difficult to improve something with decades of hard-work.

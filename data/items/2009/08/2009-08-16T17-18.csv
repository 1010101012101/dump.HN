Emulate as closely as you can what they say. This will give very positive feedback of the right kind.<p>i did an experiment with a friends just-born baby. I would get the kid's attention, then stick my tongue out.  After a couple of repeats of this, the kid responded by sticking her tongue out, much to the astonishment of her mother.  ""There is a person in there"".<p>So if we can follow this line of reasoning about adults, at least in some cultures, being off in understanding what kids understand just after birth, how far off has that perception slipped by the time they are six? teenagers?",1250445412

And you don't need to upset your work/life balance or carve out massive portions of your week to do this. You do, however, need to make some time for yourself and your brain even if it's just an hour in the morning while you have your coffee.<p>The most important thing I could tell you is to read your ass off. Get a good list of RSS feeds for blogs and magazines in your field and read through them all regularly.  Routinely look for newly published books in your field of interest and read them. Get involved in discussion boards for the same so that you can have conversations, and even debates, on the issues you want to stay on top of so that you're not in a mental vacuum - and so that you are challenged by others in your field. Keep talking about it, thinking about it, writing about it (I forget who said ""you don't know what you know until you write"" but it's true)...",1250445409

The biggest guns (see Wikipedia on Project HARP) can get a payload to 100 mi, but we can't yet combine that with the horizontal speed necessary to orbit. The problem (I gather) is the atmosphere. Sputnik was traveling along its orbit at about 18k kph, 10 times the velocity quoted for this shell, or about Mach 25 at sea level. Your muzzle velocity will have to be much higher to get it outside the atmosphere going that fast, and the shell will have to withstand ~30 seconds of shuttle-reentry-like heating and buffeting.<p>Possible, definitely, but not with this gun.",1250444890

In the abstract, what really is the difference between a desktop app running off a database and an Adobe AIR app running off a web service?  A seamless install process on the web.  A couple of extra APIs on the desktop perhaps.  But overall they’re exactly the same.<p>Moreover, the only reason for any difference at all is that the platform manufacturers haven’t caught up yet.  There’s no reason, for example, that an AIR app couldn’t do everything a desktop app could (access hardware devices, run in the background, etc…).  Adobe just hasn’t put it all in yet.<p>So at this point Desktop apps are just a specialized programming environment for those rare situations (utilities, games, hardware centric programs) where web apps don’t work.  Otherwise there’s not much difference.  So developers should do what they've always done, evaluate their requirements and pick the tool that is best for the job.",1250444882

766363,comment,766160,766215,0,0,frig,,,"This is in der Spiegel b/c there's much more basic income advocacy in Germany (especially on the part of eg Gotz Werner, mentioned early in the article); that this experiment is being run in Namibia is likely due to Namibia's links with Germany.<p>A sustained basic income program differs markedly from just ""giving people money"" and other ""poverty eradication"" methods in several ways, and it will be interesting to see if those differences lead to different long-run results in the future.<p>The two major differences are: basic income is uniformly distributed across the population at predictable rates and on a predictable schedule; the second is that the aide is explicitly in ""cash money"", and not in-kind.<p>The underlying logic is this:<p>(1) escaping from extreme poverty <i>requires</i> making-and-following-through on plans on a long time horizon; for example: deferring present consumption and leisure and instead saving and pursuing education<p>(2) the circumstances of poverty are circumstances in which it is particularly difficult to make and especially to follow-through on such long-term plans<p>(3) a basic income program directly addresses the perceived root cause of poverty -- circumstances in which longer-term planning is too difficult to follow-through on -- by providing a stabilization factor (a small but 100% predictable income) and thereby making it substantially easier for those so-inclined to stick to those plans<p>You don't have to believe in that logic, but that's the logic. Following through on it:<p>- just giving ""windfalls"" -- direct lump-sum cash -- shouldn't be expected to have the same impact (even if, in an abstruse enough outlook there's no difference between a windfall and an equivalent annuity; we're explicitly talking personal psychology, here); it allows for a temporary improvement in one's circumstances but does not directly address the predictability factor<p>- just giving aid in kind -- wells, books, etc. -- likewise improves material standard of living but does not directly address the ability to make-and-stick-to long-term plans<p>...so it would be no surprise that earlier aid was ineffective, as it was symptom-patching that didn't do anything to address the perceived root cause of poverty.<p>Your commentary on the incentive-to-make-children thing is somewhat shallow:<p>Poor people have little capital to invest and make up for by using the children as a resource. It seems like a great idea at the time, but also virtually guarantees that the kids will be poor. And the cycle repeats itself.<p>The problem you sketch is this:<p>- poor people produce children b/c children are an exploitable resource<p>- poor people lack resources to invest in raising and educating their children<p>- ergo, the children go on to also become poor, perpetuating the cycle<p>You seem to have failed to draw the connection between the problem you pointed out and the idea of pegging the stipend per-child; doing so means that the situation now becomes<p>- poor people produce children b/c children are an exploitable resource<p>- poor people now receive k<i>$stipend per offspring; so long as $stipend > $cost-of-adequately-educating-a-child there are no </i>monetary* obstacles to educating and raising all k children (for whatever size of k we pick)<p>- ergo, there's no longer the intrinsic link between ""too many kids"" and ""resources spread too thin to raise them right""; there's still room for moral failings / bad culture / bad choices / etc., but moral failings / bad culture / bad choices / etc. were present before the experiment and will likely always be with us, anyways<p>...which is why the stipend is tied to # of children. This now allows us to back up and look at the earlier criticism: ""incentive to produce children"".<p>Let's assume you're right: the extra stipend an extra kid brings in is such a material incentive that it materially effects the # of offspring women choose to have.<p>We must then ask: would increased production of offspring be a problem?<p>You seem to assume ""yes, of course"", and then explain your reasoning (what we just went through: inadequate resources => not raised right => cycle perpetuates).<p>Were the program to result in children being raised ""well enough"" (to go up a rung or two on the poverty ladder versus their parents) then the link between ""moar children"" and ""bad"" is a little less clear; it might even be the case that ""moar children"" == ""good"", in that having more children raised right speeds the arrival of some future point in time when the majority of the adult population has been raised right (instead of having learned the shiftless habits of the previous generation).<p>Time will tell, of course; this experiment would have to run for years or decades to get conclusive results; small changes happen quickly but most cultural and behavioral patterns take longer to iron out.<p>You're also being a little uncharitable in your fact-check (not incorrect, just uncharitable). Pre-BIG she wouldn't have been raising those chickens, b/c buying chickens to breed-and-raise pays off over too long of a time horizon to be practical; post-BIG, she's demonstrably using some of her surplus income to invest in activities that pay off over a longer-term, which is a clear success with respect to the general goals of what a basic income program is trying to do. So the program's verdict would be ""great, we gave people no-strings money and hoped they'd use it to build wealth and lift themselves out of poverty (instead of blow it on alcohol); this woman has done that"" and not ""well shit, if we'd known she was going to want 40 chickens we could've just given her some for 1/10th the price"" (if that kind of aid worked there wouldn't be as much poverty).",1250444348

He's only considering his own world without recognizing that Rails needs to consider everybody else too.<p>As for native code, yes that would be a problem, one that hasn't been solved yet. But luckily most dependencies are pure Ruby, and only few libraries depend on native code. Nobody's suggesting vendoring everything all the way up to the kernel, but vendoring a reasonable amount of dependencies does not seem evil to me. I don't see any point in taking an extremist approach of vendoring absolutely nothing, it will piss off a lot of users.<p>Also, if distributors will package the apps anyway, then why not vendor libraries?

In windows, it looks like the state of an application's GUI is separate from the state of the rendering system.  In X, the two things are in the same process space.  In windows, when the renderer crashes, GUI state isn't lost, a new renderer is started, and the user continues his day, slightly irritated.  In X, the renderer crashes, and all applications crash as well.  The user is somewhat more irritated.  If X were split into a renderer and an application state tracker (like, I assume, windows does), then the renderer could crash all day, and the applications wouldn't ever notice.<p>In windows, if the application state tracker crashes, you're screwed, but that since the state tracker doesn't seem to depend on any third-party drivers, it's easier to verify its functionality and try to ensure its stability.<p>As for a rewrite, I'm not really sure how much of old XFree is still around.  X has been modified in the past few years to no longer require configuration for its input (or, technically its video, but I still don't trust that).  It supports multiple pointers, and in Linux on Intel, it doesn't even have to do initialize and exert low-level control over the video card.

After being in a few research internship positions (CDF-FNAL and some biophysics work), I realized that, while I thoroughly enjoyed higher level physics, I had developed a passion for web application development. Consequently, when I was presented with a very enticing offer in July 2008, I decided to start working full time and do my last four classes (I only had non-science related electives remaining) over the next year or so.<p>As it turns out, the decision I made was a fortuitous one, due to the economic meltdown that occurred only a few months after I went from part-time work/full-time school to full-time work/part-time school. Moreover, I do enjoy my job, and the ego boost of knowing that every day my hard work is put to use by tens of thousands of people (which is, in all honesty, one of the reasons I became so passionate about web applications in the first place).<p>But I've started realizing that my mind isn't as sharp as it used to be. As someone who was consistently challenged and put to the test in academia, I'm finding that I don't actually have any day-to-day challenges to push me and keep my scientific mind exercised. With my day job, regular open source contributions, girlfriend and social life, I don't have too much free time either.<p>My question is then: How do my fellow HN'ers keep their minds sharp? Should I read more publications & papers? Should I try and do more scientifically oriented open source work?

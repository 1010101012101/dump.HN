Good balance against MMM, and one that matches what I&#x27;ve seen of my friends from immigrant families.<p>Granted, those who survive to adulthood from that kind of pressure seem to be extremely successful go-getters. But I also know of my peers who instead felt isolated from their &quot;Tiger&quot; parents, and instead ran away from home and never looked back (until their bank accounts ran dry).<p>The extreme pressures of the &quot;Tiger Immigrant Parents&quot; can be unhealthy. But as long as the pressure is done in moderation, it seems to lead to a number of &quot;elites&quot; who do well in school, get great jobs or become community leaders.<p>One day, I guess I&#x27;ll have to make that decision on what kind of Father I will be for my child.

It is a something you generate yourself. It is the byproduct of your hard work, combined with learning and mastering the system itself. Even the system itself is subject to your control if you choose.<p>It&#x27;s easy to interpret this as a positive statement about the way things simply <i>are</i>, but I don&#x27;t think the author quite intends it that way. When pressed, he might say it is a positive statement, but the clearly intended ethical significance of the statement—the fact that it has deep consequences for the way his son <i>should</i> act—suggests we can look deeper.<p>Specifically, it&#x27;s important to understand the normative dimension of the statement: that when &quot;income is not something that employers or the government ration out to you based on a rigged system&quot;, that is a good thing. And most importantly, it&#x27;s possible for things not to be that way—whether because the laws or government of your country are not set up the right way, or because you yourself have the wrong attitude about your work.<p>The attitude interpretation is probably what the piece is focusing on (and what most readers will take away), because obviously the author can&#x27;t teach his son to solve problems outside of his control. But the author is thinking about systems too.<p>When he says &quot;the system itself is subject to your control if you choose&quot; it&#x27;s clear that there are plenty of systems where this is not the case, where the system is so huge or arbitary or irrational that &quot;learning and mastering&quot; it is not possible. Examples might include oppressive dictatorships, bloated bureaucracies, or sweatshops (especially to a child).<p>------------<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that we have a responsibility not just for our own attitudes and actions, but also to shape our world in such a way that it is <i>possible</i> for the right attitude to pay off.<p>Edit: the author&#x27;s point about how the son&#x27;s savings account enables him to be generous is a great example of this. This is called &quot;moral luck&quot; by philosophers--the idea that certain conditions need to obtain before a person can be virtuous. The idea goes back all the way to Aristotle.",1432334715

During that era, making an earnest living and investing aggressively in these two markets would handsomely reward you. To automatically believe that the same is true in the current era or any other future era is a dangerous assumption.<p>In regions with the biggest opportunities from employment, employees are increasingly priced out of the real estate rally and the tax savings home ownership affords you. Similarly, there are no guarantees on how much longer the current 5 year bull market run in the public equities market will last, and how sharp and long lasting an eventual correction will be. While it is possible for informed individuals to navigate times of volatility in the markets, it is a matter easier said than done, particularly for a young professional who has not experienced market turmoil first hand.<p><i>> And yet consider the stunning case study of the children of the nation’s uber-wealthy enclaves like Palo Alto, California. Despite incredible wealth and some of the best educational institutions money can buy, kids there are more stressed, less happy, and more likely to commit suicide than others who live with a fraction of their privilege.<p>The problem arises when high-achieving parents assume that their kids need to be pushed to achieve more themselves, to beat out the other high achievers and gain access to the most elite schools, in order to compete in this incredibly challenging modern world.</i><p>It&#x27;s worth examining &quot;why&quot; these parents behave this way -- what their underlying motivations are. I&#x27;m going to simplify the situation and focus on what I believe is the largest slice of the hypercompetitive student population: the children of successful immigrants (this classification is very representative of the Palo Alto and Cupertino school districts).<p>The immigrant parents who are sending their children to High School now overwhelmingly came from modest means and worked their way to financial and social well being and stability. As immigrants, their situation was highly volatile, both with respect to employment and residence status. As the author himself notes, parents want their children to have it better than them. The worst part about being an immigrant? The fear of not knowing what will happen to you tomorrow. The fear of losing your job and getting deported was a very real possibility. What they want for their children is first and foremost, stability. More than pure financial EV, they wish to maximize the predictability and stability of their children&#x27;s employment prospects. Status and financial returns are secondary.<p>Anecdotally, even self made millionaire behave this way. Read &quot;The Millionaire Next Door,&quot; (a book primarily about small business owners with prudent spending habits who saved their way to 7 figures) and you will find that most of these self made entrepreneurs want their children to become doctors and lawyers so that they won&#x27;t have to endure the volatility that the parents suffered.<p>How do you maximize professional stability? The narrative of &quot;go to the best school and study a technical, skill based discipline&quot; is actually not misguided. The problem if any is that you quickly hit precipitously decreasing marginal returns on any additional academic competitive effort. But from the parents&#x27; perspective, even &quot;poor marginal returns&quot; looks like a no brainer. After all, they would have <i>loved</i> to have that opportunity to increase their employment stability before being subjected to the economic forces themselves. The stress in children is a result of wildly differing perspectives and experiences between the immigrant parents and the child born to safety and prosperity. The parents truly want the best for their children, informed by their own experiences and difficulties. Sadly, even &quot;the correct decision&quot; for any person is hardly ever the correct decision for another.",1432334500

I couldn&#x27;t fathom that employees were just there to make money and then forget about everything when they got home.

Thank you, Sytse, for answering already, I&#x27;m happy to go into a little more depth.<p>> I highly recommend showing users the key for their storage - I&#x27;ve had to extract the keys from FreeOTP and Google Authenticator a number of times.<p>I&#x27;m curious, in what situation would you need to extract the key while you still have access to it in one of your apps? We have recovery codes for the situation where you&#x27;ve lost the key in your app, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be what you&#x27;re describing. If you&#x27;re moving from one app or phone to another, you can just turn off 2FA on GitLab and then turn it on again—you&#x27;ll get a new key.<p>> How do you leverage 2FA with LDAP/AD accounts? Do you store/check the key in gitlab and then auth the users against LDAP/AD - or store the key in LDAP/AD?<p>The 2FA flow is the same for regular GitLab users and those backed by LDAP. After the initial username/password auth step, they are presented with the 2FA form. In both cases, the key is only in GitLab.",1432332132

9591078,comment,9588729,9591020,0,0,nadams,,,"> Instead of extracting keys don&#x27;t you want to use backup codes (that we provide)?<p>Perhaps my opinion is wrong - but if I replace my OTP generating device (such as my phone) I don&#x27;t want to use recovery codes I just want to restore FreeOTP and be on my way. Recovery codes to me is &quot;oh shit I need to get to my account right now because of some important reason X and I don&#x27;t have my phone with me&quot;. To give you some background of why - I have about 20 OTP keys in FreeOTP right now - being able to have root access and restore FreeOTP from Titanium Backup is very important to me.<p>This was particularly annoying when a service does not provide recovery codes. Or even worse (Symantec VIP OTP) they generate a random key generated based on the device - so even if you reinstall it you can&#x27;t get the same key back (according to reviews in the play store - updates have even triggered a regen of keys) - locking people out of their accounts because many services who use Symantec VIP access don&#x27;t offer recovery codes.<p>This all goes back to the idea of exporting keys from apps like FreeOTP and Google auth. People have asked numerous times but no one wants to implement it in those applications (there is a 3rd party OTP app that claims to store the keys encrypted in dropbox...but last time I used it the automatic backup stopped working....).<p>To make a long story short - if you present the QR Code I can get the key by using it a barcode scanner - but just tell me what it is so I can throw it in my password manager in the event I need to get into my account without my phone or have to replace my phone.<p>We can talk offline if you are interested and I can explain how I do 2FA for SVN and Mercurial.",1432332105

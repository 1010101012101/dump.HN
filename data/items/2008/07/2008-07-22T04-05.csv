Well-designed systems have permanent state (in S3's case, user data stored on disks) and transient state (data in caches, gossip protocol state, etc), and are <i>designed</i> to be able to do a ""clean reboot"".<p>Obviously this isn't something which you want to be doing on a regular basis, but the very fact that Amazon was able to say ""things are too screwed up, let's just do a clean reboot"" says that they did something right.  Yes, downtime sucks -- but seeing that S3 can be cleanly rebooted tells me that as far as data loss is concerned, I have far <i>less</i> to worry about... since I know now that if worst comes to worst, Amazon has a way of getting S3 back online without losing data.",1216702148

253000,comment,252897,252976,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Two assumptions:<p>A) The profit margin will stay at 35% until this new product is released.<p>b) This product won't be announced until August 19th at the earliest.<p>That means if the plan is to have a 30% unit margin at the end of the quarter, they are going to have something like a 25% margin for the second half of the quarter. Now since they are reducing the margin, we know they are planning to increase the volume. An atom laptop, while it would be cool, just doesn't have the potential to move several million units within the first month, which is roughly what it would take to lower the margins by that much. In fact, there is literally no new product that Apple could introduce that would sell enough units within the first month to lower the per unit margins by 10%. So the change must involve some existing product.<p>I think there are two realistic options here. First, they just reduce plain reduce the price of the new MacBooks and MacBook Pros. A real possibility. Second, they add an expensive component to one of their existing products. While Blueray or DDR3 would cost enough to make the numbers add up, there is no way either of those would generate enough excitement to create the extra volume Apple is looking for. So I think if they add a new component to an existing product, the only real option is SSD. Either they make SSD standard in all MacBooks, or else they replace the normal iPod with an iPod touch with way more SSD than it currently has. At least to my thinking, either a price cut or SSD are the only ways I can see the numbers adding up for Q4.",1216700466

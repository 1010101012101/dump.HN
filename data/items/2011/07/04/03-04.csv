The incentives of other countries to go along is the prevention of contagion economic depression.<p>Of course, Greece could still convert them into a currency not controlled by this coalition (Zimbabwean dollar? ;-)), but small currencies in this role cannot support Greek economic downfall and will be significantly affected by Greek economic results.

I will put a little more PF (political fiction) to make it a little bit more interesting:\n How about if your ""friend"" is a drinker and gambler, but happens to have a big fortune, say islands, nature, ancient temples. So you find his girlfriend and start lending her drinking money out of your heart's ""goodness"" without managing your loan when it is small, just let it grow... Of course your friend gets drinking money and thanks his lucky stars and all his friends for lending him just to have the pleasure of his charm.... Of course you politely ask him to spend half of that money to buy submarines and fighter aircrafts from your shop. Then one day you go and tell him, ""you know your debt is so big, me and everybody else were so surprised by the size of your debt, and really you have been only drinking and womanizing, haven't you... So we decided we will not lend you anymore. From now on you are not allowed to drink, but neither to eat, unless of course you sell to us your telecommunication industry at the amount of the next round of drinks, so what do you say?""\nIt works like a charm, your friend starts getting depressed, and gives in...\nBut then maybe he says, ""Look I am grateful for all these drinks and all but you can't in your good sense expect me to sell my property so cheaply just because you were giving gifts to my girlfriend right. I will stop drinking, please stop giving gifts to my girlfriend and wait for a while I will give them back to you.

Please dont follow this advice. It makes it really easy for the developer because theres no need to deal with time zones and things like DST. However, showing a relative time in many situations is completely opaque. If something happened 14 hours ago, did it happen at lunch time or 3 PM? A lot of times people want to know the time of day something happened, not just how long ago it occurred. Here you can do some arithmetic in your head to figure it out, but thats a major annoyance. And once the relative time flips over to X days ago the time information is completely lost. Similarly if it says About 3 months ago its impossible to know if that means March 15 or April 1 or April 15 or anywhere in between, never mind the time of day. At the very least the full date and time should be displayed in a tooltip so that its available if needed.

The new currency will immediately weaken significantly, basically forcing austerity measures onto the whole economy.

There's no way to avoid, at least implicit, object's state. For example, if user's password is not empty, it means that the user already set the password.<p>More comprehensively, with /users/1/edit, or whatever, it is frequently expected to get a different validation error, depending on the flow, such as a paid account might require more billing related details than one without email confirmed.<p>Of course, it is a nightmare to maintain such matters implicitly. That's why Ruby on Rails plugins like acts_as_machine, and similar, come handy. They do provide an explicit description of the object's behaviour, easy to transform into documentation, depending on the current state.<p>The idea shows its full potential with multipage forms. Each step of the form might be described with a different state, stored in the state attribute, leaving the controller RESTful, and the model's validations easy to understand.<p>A yet another confusion comes with too close database mapping. To stick with Ruby on Rails, there is nothing preventing the developer from creating his own setters and getters, like def vattr=(); end; def vattrr(); end.<p>The framework passes the value of a virtual attribute, using params, to #update_attribute, and other methods, the same way it does for regular attributes created automatically from the database's schema.<p>Very frequently such attribute provides a much cleaner way to represent the model, rendering either the HTML or the API much more easier to write or understand.",1309748632

3024915,comment,3024588,3024588,18,0,socratic,,,"Every time I read one of these (Github, Etsy, ...), I feel a bit guilty that our tiny startup doesn't do continuous integration/deployment.  I mean, we git push to Heroku to deploy (maybe once a week), but there is no automated push once the tests pass.  It seems like this is a big psychological leap (deploy every week vs deploy every hour).<p>When does setting up something like Jenkins CI become worth it?  When you have 2 people?  10 people?  100 people?<p>Is there tons of custom code to set it all up with Github or whatever deployment scripts exist?  What CI systems are dominant?  (I'm mostly curious about Ruby-centric ones, but don't really want to bias responses.)",1316667540

Certainly, HNers probably make better beta customers for just about any business. Let's hope they start making themselves known outside the tech field, for their sake and ours.<p>As far as access, obviously the poorest of the poor probably don't have access to an online bank, and if you make the bank unusable to people without a smart phone, you're limiting it even further. On top of that, it's not clear yet whether they will have stringent credit rating requirements that could shut a lot of people out who need a service like this.<p>My hope is that BankSimple will keep in mind how important they could be to people who really do need a less malevolent bank.

That said, I'd like to make a few points.<p>First, I suspect you're assuming I'm new to the industry or that I am working on my first startup.  In fact, I have done several, had a number of good exits, and am currently building another profitable, growing business in a large market.  I am no stranger to building successful businesses, and I've put in my time on the web developer's equivalent to the 80186 project.<p>Second, my experience is that success in building businesses in no way translates to the kind of popularity or network that venture capitalists look for.  Your claim that simply working in a startup gives one visibility to other entrepreneurs and those who funded them is not something I have seen.  I have seen tons of contact with vendors, customers, strategic partners, etc, but never venture capitalists.  They simply don't move in the same circles that bootstrapped companies move in.<p>Mind you, none of this is sour grapes.  We're doing quite well growing on the basis of our own cash flow.  We are happy to have never diluted ourselves and we are happy to have full control over the board and decision-making.  But if we ever got to a point where we would like to accelerate our growth with outside capital, there is a no door open to us in the VC community, because we lack access to that network.  Bank loans or traditional boutique private equity firms would be the likely targets of our financing efforts.<p>Anyway, I enjoyed your story of your time at Intel - it's great to see one of the ""fathers"" of early microprocessors here on HN.  Thanks.",1316665371

To quote your article ""To thrive, HTML and company need what those other platforms have: a single source repository and a good owner to drive it""<p>The only other way to read that is that you're advocating splintering web technology into HTML-Moz, HTML-IE, HTML-Cr and so on. While that might make for a better developer experience for somebody who develops apps for _one_ of those platforms, it's a disaster in terms of interoperability. Which is kind of one of the key points of ""The Web"".<p>We were heading down that path for a while with browser-specific extensions, and it lead to large problems. For users, because they needed to have ""just the right browser"".

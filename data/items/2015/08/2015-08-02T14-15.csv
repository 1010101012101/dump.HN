9990936,comment,9989661,9989881,0,0,arielweisberg,,,"I would classify that as FUD.<p>The article complains that Vanguard&#x27;s 10x less expensive wrapper fund isn&#x27;t as inexpensive as buying separate Admiral&#x27;s share versions of their index funds. They neglect to mention the minimum investment amounts for Admiral shares nor the risk of behavioral or technical errors rebalancing that could eat away any gains you might get from maintaining a fund mix yourself across several accounts. This actually happened to me and wiped away a few months of gains.<p>I personally keep separate funds, but I do it because I have many accounts with varyings amounts of money and need to maintain an asset allocation across all of them. Retirement funds make that hard as does lack of fund choice in many accounts.<p>For people not willing or stressed out by managing their money, wrapper funds offered by Vanguards are a great option that shouldn&#x27;t be confused with other target retirement funds that are based on active trading strategies. In the future it&#x27;s possible they will make an Admiral version.",1438527568

Uber is one since they need to get critical mass of drivers/riders in many cities to take over. uBeam is also one of those companies, as a whole lot of R&D has to be done to take it to market.

9990929,comment,9990660,9990878,0,0,weinzierl,,,"I agree with your point, just wanted to add that from the Unicode perspective emoticons (=ASCII smiley) and emojis are
not the same.<p><pre><code>   Q: Are emoji the same thing as emoticons?

   A: Not exactly. Emoticons (from “emotion” plus “icon”) 
   are specifically intended to depict facial expression 
   or body posture as a way of conveying emotion or 
   attitude in e-mail and text messages. They originated 
   as ASCII character combinations such as :-) to indicate 
   a smile—and by extension, a joke—and :-( to indicate a 
   frown. In East Asia, a number of more elaborate 
   sequences have been developed, such as (&quot;)(-_-)(&quot;) 
   showing an upset face with hands raised. Over time, many 
   systems began replacing such sequences with images, and 
   also began providing ways to input emoticon images 
   directly, such as a menu or palette. The emoji sets used 
   by Japanese cell phone carriers contain a large number 
   of characters for emoticon images, along with many other 
   non-emoticon emoji. [1]

The box is holding the tacks already, so you&#x27;ve just replaced one problem with a different one. We don&#x27;t pull all stops out to solve problems because usually doing so makes more problems.

If all I cared about was &#x27;solving the problem&#x27; I&#x27;d have taken out my tools and broken the plastic panel off and switched the door.

9990925,comment,9987142,9989327,0,0,EublepharisRex,,,"Thanks for some fascinating contributions to this thread.<p>I see both sides of the debate, and lean toward your side. But I also think both sides are probably wrong to speak as if we will have either one system or the other in the foreseeable future. I think it is more likely that government resources and law enforcement will exist alongside any trustless contract system, acting as a failsafe (or guarantor of exploitation, depending on your POV I suppose). Few contracts would be irreversible, and few holders of contracts would resist reversal, if physical violence from the state were brought to be bear, even if the issue had already been &quot;settled&quot; by software. I believe the reality is that Ethereum-style contracts would increase efficiencies in more routine, less controversial contracts and the state would remain the final recourse in more extreme cases. As some have said, 30 years down the road when machines are more intelligent, all bets are off. But for the foreseeable future, the state isn&#x27;t going to wither away just yet.<p>As far as people obfuscating with complex contracts, yes, of course they will do that. But the obvious implication is that a class of techno-jurists will have to arise to help advise users. Again, that&#x27;s not much different than the current system of clueless folk consulting attorneys, and I imagine both systems would coexist for some time to come.",1438527299

But at the same time, is it <i>really</i> necessary to have half a dozen fish, trains, several food items an alien head, a full set of numbers from 1-10, squares of different sizes, and other non-emotional iconography?<p>And then the argument is that this is just intended to encode Japanese carrier emoji.

That&#x27;s supposed to be handled by the font that&#x27;s representing the script, not by the encoding.<p>This really needs to be a separate encoding that&#x27;s not unicode.

It&#x27;s really hard, it creates all kinds of friction, you need all kinds of overhead human capital to organise everything, everything moves slower, there&#x27;s more resistance to change, and various of the smaller groups create their own working cultures and approaches, and squaring all of that into one cohesive vision is really tricky.<p>Then consider that companies are relatively dictatorial compared to the runnings of most OECD countries, where a CEO has more power to simply lay down a vision and expect everyone to get behind it, much more than a president or prime minister doing so.<p>I think that&#x27;s mostly it. For a more academic approach look up diseconomies of scale, although I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re already familiar... It also applies to government. I do agree with you though, to a large extent I think we can scale, but there are limits and disadvantages at some point.<p>Beyond that I think to a large extent the differences can be numerically explained. It&#x27;s not true that small countries do best across the board. Germany does better than Italy, Kenya does better than Malawi, China does better than Vietnam who does better than Cambodia etc... all larger countries that do better.<p>But imagine you have a list of 10 &#x27;large&#x27; countries, and 100 &#x27;small countries&#x27;. Obviously the large are less common, after all only two countries have more than 1 billion people, no other ones more than 500m, only 3 other countries have more than 200m, while more than 100 countries have less than 10 million people.<p>So imagine 10 large and 100 small countries, and they&#x27;re randomly distributed. The chance of a small country in the top 10 is very large, as it is to be in the bottom 10, while for large countries the chance is really small to simply end up anywhere. Yet if you break up the US into 100 little regions of a few million people, like about 80 countries on the planet, similar to say Norway, Singapore, Finland (all 5m ish people), or Iceland (300k), you&#x27;d surely have many of those little regions hitting top 10 rankings for standard of living. Places like greater San Fransisco would probably do quite well.",1438526469

What do I mean? Well, most objects are largely diffuse, meaning that light is reflected in a random direction. When you hit a diffuse object, you can choose to sample light that &#x27;randomly&#x27; bounces off in the direction of the sun. Since if it bounces off away from the sun, then it doesn&#x27;t contribute light.<p>Lots of caveats here, of course. You <i>do</i> need to also sample light going in other directions, since the sun isn&#x27;t the only light source (other objects reflect). You can only do this on diffuse surfaces, so you need to keep going until you hit a diffuse surfaces. Most surfaces are partly diffuse partly specular, etc. so you&#x27;ll actually want to sample both straight towards the light source and off in other angles.<p>But what does the most simple path tracer look like? You shoot rays from the camera. If it hits a diffuse surface, bounce a ray toward each light, adding that light if that ray isn&#x27;t obstructed from the light. If it hits a specular surface, bounce off based on the surface and ray orientations, and recurse when you hit another surface. You see how we cheat? If everything is diffuse, then we only ever make one bounce, straight from us to the sun. But that&#x27;s a great first order approximation, since sunlight is so much brighter than reflected light. Same approach works for more bounces; just end with it trying to hit the sun.",1438525931

GL getting a taxi license with a DUI under you belt or while being on the sexual offenders list, but you can still drive UBER....<p>The same way no one would use an UBER like service to get a doctor if they knew they could get a med-school dropout or some alcoholic that lost his practice due to malpractice suits however they are perfectly fine with getting into a car with a stranger at 2am knowing that unlike a registered car hire service or a taxi they weren&#x27;t screened, it&#x27;s not recorded in public records available to the local police and that they aren&#x27;t covered by insurance and can be named in a law suit if anything happens during that trip.<p>Oh and this is without even getting into other things like UBER pissing over employment and taxation laws, doesn&#x27;t verify that drivers do not work over the maximum amount of hours allowed by law, do mandated pit stops on long trips, maintain their cars etc...<p>My personal experience using UBER in London:<p>Driver hitting a cyclist and &quot;contemplating&quot; a hit and run.<p>Driver selling out weed out of his car.<p>Driver who was clearly working for at least 10-12 hours falling a sleep at the wheel.<p>Driver who was also working for just-eat or some other food delivery service carrying pizza and curry and asking me if i don&#x27;t mind him stopping on the way.<p>Driver who had an open can of beer in the central console (didn&#x27;t enter that ride).<p>I don&#x27;t use UBER anymore i use the black cab / car service hire apps depending on the time of day and the location they aren&#x27;t considerably more expensive (less than 10% on average unless you&#x27;ll take a very long ride)

2. Use a specialized WiFi router. I use the ones from TP-Link in which I can restrict speed for a particular device IP. DD WRT based routers can also help here.",1438524127

However, this ultimately requires that you have a central server on which you can &quot;advertise&quot; your SIP presence and exchange SDP data. Yes, the session payload transport (RTP) is peer to peer, but the signalling still requires a central point.<p>> How can I get your js/css from outside, if you are behind NAT?<p>The same way you get the HTML, whatever approach is used.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impossible to build a system involving distributing &quot;advertisements&quot; saying how to reach systems on a distributed hash table, then using either ports opened through UPNP on home routers or a &quot;supernode&quot; collection of STUN servers to communicate to home systems. There are three big downsides to this which are probably why we&#x27;ve not seen one yet:<p>- no way to monetise it if it&#x27;s truly distributed and open source => reduced incentive to build and maintain<p>- no central party to fight spam and abuse => system will drown in spam and abuse<p>- necessarily broadcasts an association between home IP address and person => vulnerable to privacy problems and DOS attacks",1438524088

If only those that came before you hadn&#x27;t been so willing to shout &quot;Hooray&quot; and make a choice you disagree with.<p>I don&#x27;t think you have to have respect for those that came before you.  But blithely ignoring their context when they made these choices is... rude.  At best.

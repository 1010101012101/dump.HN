9663230,comment,9662421,9663188,0,0,themeek,,,"It is ironic in a certain sense. Comments here unfortunately were and are linking the two in a causal way rather than just pointing out the double standard.<p>The point of these backdoor programs is that there is an asymmetry in how the vulnerabilities can be exploited. The point being that the calculus has been done - right now the benefit to national security (the place of the US in the &#x27;world pecking order&#x27; - it&#x27;s ability to project power and protect its strategic interests) is greater than its detriment to national security.<p>Now, it absolutely does weaken &#x27;personal security&#x27;. Broken encryption, backdoors, weak protocols, federated auth, these things decrease the digital security of companies and persons.<p>As a person not involved in performing the calculus of national security (again global strategic interests) it is easy to see these programs as merely a threat with no obvious gain. Those concerned with national security and global competition see this as a small price to pay to wield a large amount of global influence.<p>This is a good way to understand why the FBI will say things that seem so plainly wrong to the HN crowd.<p>I happen to agree with the HN folk wisdom - that the national security apparatus is there to protect our democracy not the other way around - but to really engage with the issue its important to understand what the &#x27;other side&#x27; is arguing more fully.<p>This is a very complicated space. Very important policy scholars (Sunstein) even recommends reinterpreting free speech to mean something closer to what we&#x27;ve historically criticized China for.<p>Going forward we need as much informed debate as possible. The national security apparatus isn&#x27;t going to listen to the public if the public can&#x27;t understand the issues they grapple with and engage it charitably.<p>I hope I didn&#x27;t rant too long.",1433465968

And while it might be new, it wasn&#x27;t actually difficult to come up with, and has at this point been independently compiled 3 or 4 times by different people.  (One of the things I tried to do with my post was show how easy it actually was, and hopefully inspire other people to do similar research, or keep going with this story.)<p>Certainly going years back there were a handful of aircraft mentioned as possibly being FBI, and a couple companies mentioned as being fronts, and there were people claiming that planes squawking 4414 or 4415 or using JENA or JENNA callsigns were doing FBI surveillance, and it was those pieces of information that helped me synthesize the larger context and identify the specific aircraft involved.<p>Ted Bridis, an AP editor who worked on the AP story that broke the story in the mainstream media, wrote a really awesome comment on reddit that described their investigation and the background of all the fragmented pieces of related info that predated their work, and gives a great illustration of what real journalism is: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/38eoud/im_sam_richards_the_guy_who_broke_the_fbi_aerial/crvcmke"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/38eoud/im_sam_richard...</a><p>> The author apparently didn&#x27;t consider the possibility that those people on the &#x27;conspiracy/paranoia/gun rights&#x27; sites may have already done the same research that he did<p>Like I said, it would be neat to find that someone had compiled these lists already. If you can find a link, there would be some journalists who would be interested in seeing it.<p>It&#x27;s also true that this isn&#x27;t &quot;new&quot; in the sense that we&#x27;ve known for years that the FBI is doing aerial surveillance, and we could guess at the scale (but we didn&#x27;t actually know the scale, and now we have some sense of it).  But I think now that we see how many planes are involved, how often they&#x27;re flying over so many cities, and we have lots of screenshots of circular tracks, people (including a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee) feel it more viscerally and aren&#x27;t necessarily happy about it.<p>This article by Kashmir Hill is much better than my slapdash post, with context and stuff: <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/143739/how-you-can-track-the-fbis-spy-planes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fusion.net/story/143739/how-you-can-track-the-fbis-sp...</a>",1433465840

But the truth is, even if this system works at the grand scale, it’s hurting both learners and teachers in countless subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Here are just a few:<p>1) The system we’ve created is assumed to be a meritocracy, but is actually driven far more by popularity and market trends than it is by the quality, relevance, depth, and effectiveness of our learning materials.\nAlthough it is far from a zero-sum game, the current model is much more competitive than it is cooperative, and so suffers the consequences that come along with any competitive environment.<p>2) Because being highly skilled at both writing and software development is rare, those who can do it well are often get the most attention and influence from the software world, turning these folks into “thought leaders” that drive the overall direction of the community.<p>3) Producing high-quality educational resources is obscenely, ridiculously difficult and time consuming. So the people who can invest the effort are typically either from a position of economic advantage, or are backed by monied interests.<p>4) As a result, the materials that get produced, and the topics that get covered widely are based on where the money and social buzz is at right now. Those who are doing original research, particularly things that are experimental or exploratory in nature, are not well supported at all.<p>5) Because we’ve tied blogging and teaching and tweeting to hireability, plenty of people enter into the bazaar not because they particularly want to, but because they must do so in order to “prove their worth” to potential employers or clients. Again, this clearly benefits those who have lots of time and resources to burn, and burdens everyone else with massive amounts of shadow work. We cannot be surprised at the lack of socioeconomic and cultural diversity in light of this point.<p>6) The success of the few enables the selling of dreams to the many, creating a cottage industry of infomarketers. In effect, these are the folks who sell pickaxes and maps to gold prospectors, and it’s no surprise that their business is booming. Some of these folks are brilliant and insightful, but many are hucksters.<p>In light of all this, we cannot say “this is just how the internet works”, as true as that statement is now. We have to ask, how do we make things better for our future selves and those who will come after us down this road?</i>",1433465655

Rounding that down to something a founding father could say: the executive branch spied on the legislative branch while it was investigating the executive branch for breach of law.<p>With regard to US world order - it&#x27;s so hard to tell when an empire is doing the world more good than bad - and between various &#x27;opportunity costs&#x27; to the good it could do the world under its order.<p>In this sense, the US does do some very, very dirty deeds. It is not above killing and even torturing and then killing innocent people, committing mass fraud on the world to justify its interests, or involving itself in the rape of children, and trafficking of arms and drugs internationally (illegally) to supply proxy forces. It propagandizes and it censors and it disappears people. It steals resources and engages in protectionist trade while espousing free markets. It rigs elections overseas and it coups genuine leadership. It assassinates key figures to decide geostrategic events. It has a long list of scandals.<p>To maintain its justified place at the top of the world order it needs to maintain an image of legitimacy. If you ask those who know about its special operations who is on the US&#x27;s side you will hear precisely what you have mused about: the good that America does in keeping a world order with static boundaries based on trade and other forms of competition is collectively a better world to live in, even if some people - in the eyes of the power elite - need to be subjected to torture for it to continue.<p>Digesting this statement requires a neigh impossible task: predicting alternate futures where current order never developed and in its place another one does. Quickly this task becomes an imaginative one that falls prey to the leanings and biases of the person imagining it: those who favor the US imagine a more chaotic world and those who favor another nation a more peaceful one.<p>It&#x27;s nearly impossible to ask this question, so the real work to be done is through alternate questions. What can we do now? What questionable programs and opinions exist today that can be dismantled? What powers are needed to maintain a peaceful sphere? Should the world have one protector, or is it possible for some Wilsonian (or other) creation to succeed at the task?<p>I can&#x27;t give you those answers. I don&#x27;t have them myself.<p>As an aside - one I hope is interesting - the United States relies very heavily on its reputation as a just and kind force to maintain its legitimacy. Were qualms with the US to bubble into a loss of legitimacy the world order would quickly dissipate.<p>This is what the US fears the most. It has to keep the optics at a higher bar than it can keep its practices. It hopes, it wishes and it needs to find solutions that allow for international stability - where it remains the top dog - and where it can keep its reputation.<p>We get to see how our leadership and representatives navigate this space and we get to be the primary sources for the historians to annotate it for the future.",1433464853

I hardly saw anyone take any interest in the idea of Java on embedded devices, and the booth remained empty despite some good presentation with large signs and plenty of floor space.<p>Anecdotal? Maybe. But I think many device guys would cringe at the idea of something as bloated as Java running on a device. I&#x27;ve done my share of Java on server and Android at Google, and I certainly do.

We have a graph that shows traffic over time vs response time over time, and thankfully those lines go in opposite directions, but it&#x27;s only due to the continuous work of dozens of engineers as we discover new ways that large amounts of transactional traffic and data can play mischievously together. And while doing that we also have to move the needle on product: if you look at a screenshot of Airbnb two years ago and compare it to today, it&#x27;s very different (especially on the native apps and mobile web). And the screenshot you&#x27;d be looking at is probably just on the guest side, which is simpler: on the host side, we&#x27;ve done even more that&#x27;s invisible to the casual traveler, like automatic pricing recommendations based on geographic and seasonal data, major investments into fraud detection and prevention, global currency exchange, etc. Not to mention all of the tooling, monitoring, and alerting that needs to happen to support all of that growth.<p>None of this stuff is free and usually it requires rethinking how old systems work and interact with each other, especially as we do more complex calculations with larger amounts of data. To be honest I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re generally about a year away from hitting the wall, every year. We&#x27;ve made a lot of improvements (when I joined almost four years ago we were maybe... two months away from hitting a wall? Super scary), but if we all just phoned it in the growth in usage would overwhelm us quickly.<p>Re: San Francisco — yeah, it&#x27;s definitely tough to recruit out of a single geographic pool. SF is probably the best area to do it in, since there&#x27;s a large cluster of really great engineers here, but there&#x27;s no doubt we miss great talent that won&#x27;t or can&#x27;t relocate. It takes a lot of work to do remote engineering offices well: how do you make sure that the engineers in satellite offices feel connected to HQ? How do you make sure they work on meaningful projects, but also don&#x27;t miss out on context and information that comes from humans naturally chatting to the people that are around them? These aren&#x27;t unsolvable problems (and a number of more-established, older companies have already solved them to some degree, and even some startups that are trying the Moneyball-style approach), but as a team we haven&#x27;t done it yet. We do have remote non-engineering offices, so it&#x27;s not impossible to imagine some day having a distributed eng team, but today we&#x27;re just in SF. Some day, maybe? It takes work but there&#x27;s certainly payoff for extending your reach.",1433464775

As long as a mathematical structure is possibly computable, then it is being computed on some dust, though it does not matter what dust actually is, only that there be a possible interpretation where such a computation is taking place somehow.

These integrated applications provide bounded functionality, have a single thread of control and a fixed user interface that must anticipate every-thing the user will need. Current workstations allow several processes to share the screen. With proper communication between processes, it is possible to escape previous models for application development and evolution. ConMan is a high-level visual language we use on an IRIS workstation that lets users dynamically build and modify graphics applications. To do this, a system designer disintegrates complex applications into modular components. By interactively connecting simple components, the user constructs a complete graphics application that matches the needs of a task. A connection manager controls the flow of data between individual components. As a result, we replace the usual user-machine dialog with a dynamic live performance that is orchestrated by the user.",1433463632

Security, quality of build, and convenience are among the factors that could be pitched to early adopters.

Over and above cost, upgrading is a much larger installation hassle, far larger IMO than e.g. Nest thermostats had to overcome.  All of that will limit adoption rates, even for willing early adopters.

(As opposed to median), which makes it a lot less interesting.<p>Why so much focus on wage, when we could instead focus on building more housing?  It seems like on some level if you increase wages, landlords will just increase rent.  If you increase supply, landlords will reduce rents so their buildings don&#x27;t remain empty.<p>Doing some quick math, if someone works 40 hours a day for 52 weeks a year at a minimum wage job, they will make: \n7.25 * 40 * 52 = $15080 a year.<p>The VOX article says you should spend at most 30% of income on rent.  Which works out to: 4524 a year or $377 a month.<p>At current mortgage rates (assuming 0 down), someone could break even in 30 years spending ~$77K to build a 1 bedroom apartment using $377 a month to make the loan payments.<p>It follows that if you could construct 1 bedroom apartments for less than $77K per unit in today&#x27;s market you could solve the housing problem, and make money simply by providing 1 bedroom apartments to low income minimum wage workers.<p>An anecdote.  When Facebook was based in the Palo Alto area it offered stipends to employees who lives near the office.

I was pretty handy with BMX bikes, but I was honestly in over my head at the time when it came to road bikes or anything with a derailleur.  Never made any money off of it, but I still like wrenching on my own bikes.<p>Later in life, after spending some time doing finish carpentry work (hanging doors, doing door trim, window trim, molding, shit like that), I got interested in hardwood flooring and considered starting a business to specialize in installing that stuff.  But after chewing on the idea a while, I decided it would just be a distraction and forgot about it.<p>My dad, on the other hand, was a serial entrepreneur who ran all sorts of businesses throughout my childhood. Of hand, I can recall:<p>1. Owning a pulpwood truck and chainsaws, and cutting down trees and hauling logs to the paper mill.<p>2. Building and selling handmade crab-pots.<p>3. Building docks and bulkheads.<p>4. Owning a bulldozer, loader, dump-truck, etc., and doing land grading, lot clearing, driveways, etc.<p>5. Shrimping and clamming and selling seafood to the local wholesale seafood house.<p>6. Finishing cement pours - doing foundations, slabs, etc.<p>I probably missed a few, but he was always doing something.  I think I picked up the whole entrepreneurial spirit thing from him, even though I&#x27;m not sure he even knows the word &quot;entrepreneur&quot;.  My dad is more &quot;street smart&quot; than &quot;book smart&quot; but he&#x27;s done OK for himself.",1433462419

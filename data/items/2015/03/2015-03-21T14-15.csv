9242864,comment,9233491,9241237,0,0,grandalf,,,"I don&#x27;t disagree, but in terms of a framework for evaluating the behavior of businesses I think the following is reasonable:<p>Businesses should act within the law, and lawmakers and the public determine what legal safeguards are necessary. For example, if you start a restaurant you must comply with health code, fire code, etc.  If you start a bank you need to keep a certain amount of risk capital, etc., etc.<p>One could argue that all dishes used by a restaurant should go through hospital level sterilization, or that banks should contain more risk capital than they are required to by law.  Such arguments would be in the name of safety or quality.<p>One could similarly argue that restaurants should use at least 20% locally grown produce or that banks should lend 20% of capital to underprivileged groups.  Such arguments are in the name of moral responsibility, etc., and lawmakers have actually implemented many such laws for banks.<p>For an investor who wishes to invest in a bank or a restaurant, there are many options.  Being able to compare financials and other metrics will help the investor figure out which is the smartest investment (based on her risk appetite, etc., etc.)<p>Why might a restaurant decide to focus on locally grown produce or a bank decide to focus on its ethical treatment of subprime borrowers?  Largely for PR/marketing reasons.  If such marketing campaigns are successful, customers will flock to the bank or restaurant in question and (assuming they are still able to be profitable) make the bank or restaurant a more desirable investment.<p>One can pick any business and any metric that he thinks has moral significance and claim either &quot;regulators should require x, y, or z&quot; or that &quot;that practice is horrible&quot;.  One might be right... essentially ahead of the game morally from society&#x27;s average.<p>The perception of moral progressiveness, like the font chosen for a brand, is one factor that helps determine a business&#x27;s success.  It may be the case that most of the meat we eat was raised in unconscionable conditions, or that 30% of imported electronics were assembled by modern serfs in near-slavery.  The more we are aware of such things, the more likely firms are to make the most progressive choices.",1426949589
9242863,comment,9203763,9212184,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Hi there, didn&#x27;t see this until just now.<p>The metric that is improving is the latency experienced by a user.<p>Imagine that you have a web app that takes one second of server CPU time to render a page, and you have three servers which process three hits a second in total. All three servers are thus on 100% CPU load, dealing with one hit a second each.<p>Each time somebody visits your site, they are going to experience a 1 second latency (in addition to communication latency), as they wait for one of your servers to build the page.<p>If you then optimize your code so that it completes in a third the time, 333ms, then your servers are going to suddenly be at 1/3 load; they execute their one query for 333ms, and then sleep for 667ms.<p>Not just that; but the user now only has to wait for 333ms for the page to render on the server, so the site gets a lot more snappy for them.<p>Then you can shut down two servers leaving one; it will sit on 100% load, but you <i>still keep</i> the shorter 333ms latency experienced by your users.<p>You are doing the same amount of work as before - 3 hits a second. But previously, when the tasks took 1s each, three would be running in parallel, each being completed more slowly. With the faster run time, they are running in series, being completed quickly before switching to the next one.<p>Now, this does <i>not</i> apply if your requests are queuing. Because you&#x27;re not able to do any more work than before (after shutting down the other two servers), if your hits/s exceeds the capacity of your servers to deal with them, the backlog will grow just as fast as it normally would have, and the latency caused by this will sky rocket.<p>Your example doesn&#x27;t fit because multiple machines aren&#x27;t ever used to process front end web requests in parallel; you don&#x27;t render half of a template on one machine, and the other half on another, for example. If you can set up a system like this and see gains from it, then what I&#x27;ve written above will not apply.",1426949584

9242854,comment,9238839,9240249,0,0,waiquoo,,,"Does this mean that startups are limited with regards to the level of innovation? I notice that a lot of startups don&#x27;t really do anything new technology-wise, but have more of an emphasis on organization (for example, Uber reorganizes transportation, Bitcoin reorganizes money, but both use existing technology in the form of software languages). If I&#x27;m doing something really new (and I think I am because I sometimes have trouble convincing people that what I do is even possible), then the only recourse is to use the dated patent and licensing model with large established companies. If this is the case, then the startup model of innovation has failed at a fundamental level; ie the advantage of a small group doing something difficult only exists for an intermediate level of innovation, don&#x27;t try to do something &#x27;really&#x27; new. Would you agree?",1426949319
9242853,comment,9238839,9239581,0,0,graycat,,,"Sorry, my view is that a solo founder
can be just fine.  I&#x27;m a solo founder and
believe I don&#x27;t need and shouldn&#x27;t want
a co-founder.<p>Here&#x27;s why:  The bottleneck in my project is just 
cutting my way through bad documentation --
all the rest, especially the crucial, core,
<i>secret sauce</i>, original applied math,
technical part along with typing in the
code itself and getting it into good shape,
has been fast, fun, and easy.<p>A co-founder might be able to 
get Windows Server 2012 and
SQL Server Enterprise Edition or
some such installed and running
quickly while I would have to do 
all the mud
wrestling with wildly obscure
and inaccurate documentation.<p>Okay, but I really <i>should</i>,
as is commonly said, <i>know my business</i>
and, thus, should get SQL Server
running myself, take notes, etc.<p>And when I have good revenue,
I will just call for paid support
and get a tutorial, explanations
for each step, corrections when
the steps don&#x27;t work, take notes
again, etc. -- still no co-founder
needed.<p>But, again as founder and 100% owner,
I need to &quot;know my business&quot;.  So, no matter
how obscure the Microsoft documentation is
for, e.g., how to get a connection string
for SQL Server (took a week of mud
wrestling, in the dark -- with
clear and correct documentation 
I could easily have done it in
10 minutes), it&#x27;s just work --
mud wrestling in the dark with
alligators and poisonous snakes
while being treated to
a barbed wire
enema and an unanesthesized
upper molar root canal procedure
while being poked two dozen times
with a red hot branding iron --
I have to do.<p>For a <i>prototype</i> or using <i>lean</i>
development methodology, no thanks:
I just wrote the darned code,
wrote it as fully solid, production
quality code, at least according
to common standards for such code.
I tested it, timed it, documented
it.  I was in a team at IBM that
shipped IBM Program Product
code (IBM&#x27;s highest quality 
software category), and the code
I&#x27;ve written for my startup
looks as good as Program Product
code to me.  And I documented the
heck out of the code because I know that
if my startup works and becomes
a big thing, then I will have to
return to some parts of the code
to put in tweaks for <i>high
scalability</i>, e.g., for Web user
session state, for a positive
integer n, partition all the
possible session state keys,
each a GUID, into n partitions,
have one session state server
for each partition, and, then,
in the server side code of 
a Web page, given a key,
do a fast lookup to find the
IP address of the session state
server for that key -- simple
code tweak, but, still, I want
the code to be tweaked 
<i>very</i> well documented.<p>Net, for the crucial, core work,
I don&#x27;t want to <i>delegate</i> it.
So, no need for a co-founder.
So, no risk of any co-founder
disputes.  So, get rid of one
of the worst risks for a startup.<p>If my startup works, then I will
start to hire but not any <i>co-founders</i>.
Instead, the first hire will be 
an <i>office manager</i>!  She, likely
a woman with a lot of <i>social
maturity</i> and general business
experience, will do the first
interface to the phones, mail,
e-mail, bookkeepers, accountants,
lawyers, landlords, bank account,
credit cards, expense accounts,
the advertisers, 
billing, depositing checks,
paying bills, record keeping,
etc.<p>As that job grows, she
can hire assistants.  Eventually
her work will be that of the
COO, CFO, and HR.  She would
be a candidate for one of 
those slots or just remain
as my assistant or something
else.<p>Some of my work will become that
of the CTO, e.g., run the server
farm.<p>And in time I will want a 
staff, e.g., to come up with
ideas, study issues, propose
solutions, present their
work in papers and talks, etc.<p>During the initial growth, I
will be able to manage all that
work because early on I will have done
the first, small, beginning
cases of all of it so know
at least the first parts.<p>But, during the growth, no one
hire, if they left, could sink
the company.  The only key
person in the company will be 
me.<p>So, grow?  Yes.  Hire?  Yes.
<i>Co-founder</i>?  No.  E.g.,
I helped start FedEx, was
right there, my office next
to COB, CEO Fred Smith&#x27;s.
I saw a lot of how he did it
and saved his company twice.
He had no co-founder.<p>This stuff about <i>co-founders</i>
looks like something equity
investors want:  It appears 
that they want
(1) a ready source of a new
CEO if they don&#x27;t like the
current CEO, (2) want the
power of a solo founder as the
unique, <i>key</i> player
diluted, and (3) want to
be able to have more <i>control</i>
over the company via <i>divide and
conquer</i> among the co-founders.  
No thanks.<p>The whole startup equity funding
situation looks like very fishy
business to me:  So, clearly the
way it works, nearly always, is,
I do all the work to go from
nothing to a product or service,
with users or customers
and revenue, and then someone
with a term sheet and a checkbook
might write me an equity check.<p>But, as a solo founder, it won&#x27;t
take much revenue to make my
little sole proprietorship
profitable, a <i>life style</i> business.
E.g., at current ad rates, keeping
a $2000 server at my left knee busy
sending Web pages can get me
by far the nicest income of my life.<p>Then, if the business is good,
that is, lots of people on the
Internet like my work, 
I&#x27;ll have plenty of cash for
<i>organic</i> growth without equity
funding.  If my business is not good,
then I don&#x27;t deserve
equity funding anyway.<p>Basically as a solo founder,
I can&#x27;t get equity funding until
after I don&#x27;t need it.<p>But, I shouldn&#x27;t much complain:
US <i>Main Street</i> businesses,
e.g., auto repair, restaurants,
convenience stores, print shops,
plumbers, electricians, 
HVAC companies, etc. don&#x27;t
get equity funding, and
my <i>information technology</i>
startup needs much less
capex to start and opex
to run than any of those
Main Street businesses.<p>So, what startups get offered
and take equity funding?
Maybe a promising startup
with four founders,
each with a maxed out
credit card and a pregnant
wife?  I only have a debit
card, no credit cards.
I don&#x27;t have a pregnant
wife, don&#x27;t even have a wife.
So, maybe I&#x27;m seeing more 
reason to be a solo founder.<p>> The more progress you make on the business, the easier it will be to get a great cofounder.<p>Yes, and the less I will need a co-founder!",1426949311

A static bug can be worked around, but a moving target is harder to compensate for, particularly if it is not viewed as user-programmable (for lack of documentation, or license, etc).<p>To me, this demonstrates that the proper place for security is in software, at as high a level as possible for the purpose. Even secure boot is too low. Boots should be insecure, but repeatable. Turning a computer on should give full control - only then can you lock it down (whatever that means to the user...). Secure boot, if you want it, should just be a bootloader that verifies a payload, thereby protecting itself - not a BIOS-integrated feature, where the BIOS is opaque.<p>A feature-full BIOS would only makes sense if it were immutable (and even then, there would be disadvantages), or (at the other end of the spectrum) if it were as programmable as the rest of the system - but until then, any unnecessary complexity or &quot;features&quot; are downright harmful.",1426948562

I <i>do</i> eat some meat, and for some reason I don&#x27;t have a single thought for the pigs that have to get killed to make the dry sausages or cured ham I eat.

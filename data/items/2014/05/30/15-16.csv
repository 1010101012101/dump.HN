It is not a sustainable decision, but I guess it will only be reverted when the noise about it is enough, which will only happen when high dpi displays become more common.<p>Anyhow, it is not correct to assume X lies about the display density. Modern distros set the density correctly, ever since the infrastructure for xrandr was put into place. Its only fault, today, is that display density can&#x27;t be set per display.

7822322,comment,7821854,7821854,20,0,fixermark,,,"Quite a few of these issues (especially in the &quot;Too many ways to do the same thing&quot; category) relate to OpenGL&#x27;s age as an API, which is something Direct3D&#x27;s design was able to learn from and improve upon. OpenGL&#x27;s origin was as a vector-based drawing tool for CAD applications which was repurposed to games; D3D was targeted for performant rendering with games as a specific target. This is demonstrated by some key features necessary for performant games (clock synchronization to avoid &#x27;tearing&#x27; comes immediately to mind) that are core to the D3D spec and extensions to the OpenGL spec. There&#x27;s also a bit of a cultural issue; if you learn OpenGL from the &#x27;red book,&#x27; you&#x27;ll learn the function-per-primitive API first, which is precisely the <i>wrong</i> tool for the job in making a performant game. Really, the OpenGL API is almost multiple APIs these days; if you&#x27;re using one flow of how to render your primitives, the other flow is downright toxic to your rendering engine (in that it&#x27;s going to muck about with your GL state in ways that you shouldn&#x27;t burn mental energy predicting).<p>Some of this is ameliorated by the OpenGL ES standard, which throws away a big chunk of the redundancy. But I&#x27;m not yet convinced that OpenGL has gotten away from its philosophical roots as a performance-secondary CAD API, which continues to dog its efforts to grow to serve game development needs. The fact that it&#x27;s functionally the only choice for 3D rendering on non-Windows platforms is more testament to the nature of the hardware-software ecosystem of graphics accelerators (and the creative doggedness of game developers) than the merits of the language.",1401464107

Simply turn it on to transform any space into a free and open communications and file sharing network. Inspired by pirate radio and the free culture movements, PirateBox utilizes Free, Libre and Open Source software (FLOSS) to create mobile wireless communications and file sharing networks where users can anonymously chat and share images, video, audio, documents, and other digital content.<p>How does it work?<p>Simply turn PirateBox on to transform any space into an offline communication and wireless file sharing network. When users join the PirateBox wireless network and open a web browser, they are automatically redirected to the PirateBox welcome page. Users can then immediately begin to chat anonymously, post images or comments on the bulletin board, watch or listen to streaming media, or upload and download files.<p>PirateBox runs on multiple devices, including wireless routers, Android-based phones, single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi, and even laptops.<p>Is it safe?<p>PirateBox is designed to be private and secure. No logins are required and no user data is logged. Users remain anonymous – the system is purposely not connected to the Internet in order to subvert tracking and preserve user privacy.<p>Can I make my own PirateBox?<p>Absolutely! The PirateBox is is free (as in freedom) because it is registered under the GNU GPLv3. This license grants the right to freely copy, distribute, and transform creative works according to the principles of copyleft.<p>PirateBox can be built for as little as US$35. For detailed instructions, visit the PirateBox OpenWrt DIY page.<p>Where can I read more about the PirateBox?<p>Visit the PirateBox Press page for a listing of and links to more than 175 stories about the PirateBox.<p>Where can I find more photos of the PirateBox?<p>Check out the PirateBox Gallery.<p>Where can I find more videos of the PirateBox?<p>Check out these PirateBox Videos.<p>Why did you build the PirateBox?<p>The PirateBox solves a technical/social problem by providing people in the same physical space with an easy way to anonymously communicate and exchange files. This obviously has larger cultural and political implications and thus the PirateBox also serves as an artistic provocation. See this ars technica article and this New Scientist article for more info.<p>Why is it called the PirateBox?<p>The PirateBox is inspired by the free culture and pirate radio movements. The name is a playful remixing of the title of the world’s most resilient BitTorrent site, The Pirate Bay.<p>Does the PirateBox promote stealing?<p>No. The PirateBox is designed to facilitate communication and sharing between friends and local community members.<p>Who helps build the PirateBox?<p>The PirateBox was created by David Darts and the lead developer is Matthias Strubel. Aaron Williamson from the Software Freedom Law Center provided advice on the project and Christiane Ruetten originally ported PirateBox to OpenWrt. The project is actively supported by developers and testers all over the world.<p>Do you know of any other projects similar to PirateBox?<p>Yes, check out Aram Bartholl&#x27;s fantastic Dead Drops. There are also several forks of the project, including Jason Griffey’s LibraryBox, the Bibliobox, the LibroBox and the CoWBox (CoWorking Box).<p>Where can I discuss the PirateBox?<p>Visit the PirateBox Forum to discuss the PirateBox, share your builds, and receive support.",1401462562

7822178,comment,7821854,7821854,37,0,pyalot2,,,"This post is factually wrong, and misguided. Here&#x27;s why:<p>#Preamble: Except on Windows you cannot run Direct3D anywhere else. Unless you plan not to publish on Android, iOS, OSX, Linux, Steambox, PS4 etc. you will have to target OpenGL, no matter how much you dislike it.<p>#1: Yes the lowest common denominator issue is annoying. However, in some cases you can make use of varying features by implementing different renderpaths, and in other cases it doesn&#x27;t matter much. But factually wrong is that there would be something like a &quot;restricted subset of GL4&quot;. Such a thing does not exist. You either have GL4 core with all its features, or you don&#x27;t. Perhaps author means that GL4 isn&#x27;t available everywhere, and they have to fall back to GL3?<p>#2: Yes driver quality for OpenGL is bad. It is getting better though, and I&#x27;d suggest rather than complaining about OpenGL, how about you complain about Microsoft, Dell, HP, Nvidia, AMD etc.?<p>#compiler in the driver: Factually this conclusion is completely backwards. First of all the syntactic compile overhead isn&#x27;t what makes compilation slow necessairly. GCC can compile dozens of megabytes of C source code in a very short time (<10ms). Drivers may not implement their lexers etc. quite well, but that&#x27;s not the failing of the specification. Secondly, Direct3D is also moving away from its intermediary bytecode compile target, and is favoring delivery of HLSL source code more.<p>#Threading: As author mentions himself, DX11 didn&#x27;t manage to solve this issue. In fact, the issue isn&#x27;t with OpenGL at all. It&#x27;s in the nature of GPUs and how drivers talk to them. Again author seems to be railing against the wrong machine.<p>#Sampler state: Again factually wrong information. This extension <a href=""http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/sampler_objects.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/sampler_objects.txt</a> allows to decouple texture state from sampler state. This has been elevated to core functionality in GL4. The unit issue has not been resolved however, but nvidia did propose a DSA extension, which so far wasn&#x27;t taken up by any other vendor. Suffice to say, most hardware does not support DSA, and underneath, it&#x27;s all texture units, even in Direct3D, so railing against texture units is a complete red herring.<p>#Many ways to do the same thing: Again many factual errors. Most of the &quot;many ways&quot; that author is railing against are legacy functions, that are not available in core profile. It&#x27;s considered extremely bad taste to run a compatibility (to earlier versions) profile and mix&mash various strata of APIs together. That&#x27;d be a bit like using Direct3D 8 and 11 functionality in the same program. Author seems to basically fail in setting up his GL context cleanly, or doesn&#x27;t even know what &quot;core profile&quot; means.<p>#Remainder: Lots of handwaving about various vaguely defined things and objecting to condjmp in the driver, again, author seems to be railing against the wrong machine.<p>Conclusion: Around 90% of the article is garbage. But sure, OpenGL isn&#x27;t perfect, and it&#x27;s got its warts, like everything, and it should be improved. But how about you get the facts right next time?",1401462516

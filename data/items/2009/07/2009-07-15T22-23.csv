Until pests become resistant to Bt toxin. Then organic farmers who use Bacillus thuringiensis might be adversely affected. This is an uncounted for externality.<p>But this externality may be worth it, if for example it gets us cheaper food. But the best way to get A LOT cheaper food is to simply stop ag. subsidies.<p>Now I happen to think the long term consumption of plants with Bt genes has a probability of being bad for you that's arbitrarily close to zero. BUT I am also a software engineer and so I know NOTHING is certain, shit happens.<p>As a libertarian I know the basics of how free markets work, and information is a key part of a working free market. Which is why I wish GM crops would be labeled as such.<p>If pests do become immune to Bt, splicing something else in is going to be harder. Because we didn't invent Bt toxin, we took it from bacteria. When happens we run out of naturally occurring toxins? If we could design molecules that would be awesome, but we're not there yet.<p>Keep in mind you can also splice pesticide resistance into crops and the way they work is by enabling yyou to go nuts with the pesticides, bathe your fields in them.<p><i>Stress-resistant GM crops can survive droughts and disease,</i><p>Drought resistant crops are still in the works. This not nearly as easy as Bt toxin was. It's a major change in plant physiology and we can't do that yet.<p>But Israel can profitably grow crops with desalinated water and computer controlled irrigation.<p>The ""this will help poor farmers"" line is a red herring. Poor farmers in developing countries are poor because their countries are a mess. If your country isn't a mess you can even grow crops in the Israeli desert.<p><i>warding off famine in developing countries across</i><p>Read up on how famines happen, The Economist had a great study. In short it's about the government response, not about any one or two crop failures.<p><i>Frankly, it’s amazing that we can remix our food to be more nutritious</i><p>Not yet. Well for simple things, like rice and vitamin A, but not in general.<p>We know that fruits and vegetables are not as nutritious today as they used to be. This is because they've been careful selected for looks and shipability. The most popular variety of tomato isn't called ""Bulletproof"" because it's so super tasty and nutritious.<p>Simply put, the mass market wants big unbruised fruits and vegetables. Why would this change just because we can now gene splice more nutrition into our vegetables? We can have more nutritious today, there's just no <i>real</i> demand for them.<p>And the tiny market segment that does demand it, is ironically least likely to buy GM foods.<p><i>faster-growing</i><p>See drought hardy.<p><i>longer-lasting</i><p>Not a problem for me. This is about shipping and storing crops for resale. How does that interest me? Lower prices - see ag. subsidies.<p><i>and tastier</i><p>See more nutritious.<p>The fact is, the genetic engineering that's going on today is not about more taste or more nutrients or really anything that affects the end consumer. It's about higher profit margins for the produces and middle men.<p>Ah you say, but surely those fat profits will shrink over time and we'll get cheaper food, but again: <i>subsidies</i>.<p>Or maybe those profits/prices will help developing countries? Again it's not the climate or the soil is the government.<p><i>make us healthier</i><p>No that's other kinds of gene splicing, crops don't do that yet, and I doubt they will ever be the best vector for medicine or what ever.<p><i>improve ag production</i><p>Depends on your definition of improve, see roundup resistant crops. Also see ag. subsidies. Many people live on $1 a day. Pretty much all European cows are subsidized to the tune of $2 a day.<p><i>make pharmaceuticals</i><p>Maybe, but almost certainly there's better vectors.<p><i>and survive hell and high water. Maybe future crops could recycle more nutrients back into dirt and help avert the looming topsoil crisis.</i><p>Now you're getting into utopian fantasy and running into some fundamental limits of, you know, physics and stuff.<p><i>So that’s what all the fuss is about.</i><p>It's about free markets and information, it's about not letting private companies have undue influence on our system of government. Or on other companies, through a very imperfect legal system, i.e. Monsanto suing companies who market their milk as rBGH free.<p>As a libertarian who works in biotech let me say: Seriously fuck Monsanto!",1247697035

706748,comment,706343,706722,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The point is that you <i>can't know</i> what it sounds like unless they are accurate.  Every consumer speaker sounds different in different ways.  So, if I bought a pair of mid-range car speakers to mix on, assuming most of my target audience would hear it on their car stereo, and I made it sound good on those speakers...even if <i>everybody</i> only listened on car speakers, odds are good it would still be too hyped or too bassy or too tinny on about half of all speakers.  The degree of variance is the problem.<p>If I mix on a set of accurate studio monitors (and assuming a reasonable level of skill in the area), the sound will be pretty well balanced across any number of speakers.  Some will be hyped (smiley curve EQ), some will be bassy, and some will be bright.  But a balanced mix will be pretty well-balanced on any set of speakers of reasonable quality.  If I mix on speakers that lead me to boost or lower a specific set of frequencies, the speakers that do the opposite will be twice as far off as if I had mixed to a balanced set of speakers.<p>Everybody here is probably pretty mathematical, so think of a single sine wave at a specific frequency.  Say I'm aiming for an amplitude of 1 (units irrelevant).  My mixing speaker boosts it by .5, because it's a speaker aimed at guys who like their cars to rattle.  So, now I've mixed this sine wave at an amplitude of .66.  If someone who likes bright sounding music (and with speakers that drop the bass by .5) listens, my mix now has the bass at .33 (ignoring all the dB math, and the crazy physics of ears/distance/frequencies etc. for the sake of simplicity).<p>If, on the other hand, I mixed on a speaker that accurately gave me a 1 when I wanted a 1, it'll play at 1.5 on the bass-heavy speakers, and at .5 on the treble-heavy speakers.  Smaller differences are better.<p>Note also that professional studios also tend to include a few sets of speakers.  You mix on the ""mains"" which are usually high quality near-field monitors, and you test on the small and big speakers and possibly a specific set of speakers that matches your target audience.  Good engineers also usually live and breathe their projects, and so they'll also listen in the car on the way home and to work in the morning.  The main work of mixing, however, always happens on a good, accurate set of monitors.  If it doesn't, odds are very good it'll sound like crap on a good portion of speakers.<p>And to answer this questions specifically:<p><i>then shouldn't it sound best when replayed on monitors?</i><p>Sure, but how many people have $1000+ speaker/amp combos in their car, iPod, home, etc.?  The problem is merely one of making the best mix for the most people.  If you know exactly what speakers your customer is using, and those are the only speakers that will be used for playback of your recording, then you would obviously tune your mix for that exact set of speakers.  But, that's pretty much never the case.  We do the best we can with a complex set of variables.",1247696924

Look at most advertising - the word has come to mean nothing more than high-end consumer grade. For the most part, if something is made explicitly for professionals in a certain field it will rely on industry-specific promotions/reviews and knowledge to make itself known, as opposed to outright advertising.

You know?<p>I have multiple monitors, but the only one that I knew was 8-bit (a high end Viewsonic intended for designers, and from a time when specs were easy to find and very clear and generally accurate, at least on high end devices) has long since left the stable as it was only 19"".  I'm certain the differences are subtle, as they are in good consumer speakers vs. good studio monitors.  But, it'd be nice to know if what I'm working with is altering my perception of things.  Particularly as I've just done several thousand dollars worth of design work for print on my new laptop which may or may not have an accurate display.  It's just nice to know what I'm dealing with is all.",1247696238

For the vast majority of people - ""professional"" or otherwise - 6bit vs. 8bit color doesn't matter. It looks good, it's fast, it runs what they want. Those are the things that matter.<p>As a developer, I consider myself a ""professional"", and my life is fine with 6bit color. My roommate is a screenwriting ""professional"" and they're fine with 6bit color. Presumably an 8bit color display would cost more, and hence would reduce the number of people who could afford the machine, at the expense of pleasing one small market segment.<p>Bottom line is that if a feature (any feature) was important enough for me that it would make or break my decision to buy the underlying system, I'd explicitly confirm its existence (in a way more rigorous than ""millions and millions"", which sounds like marketing-speak), and I'd get reviews from my peers who would have the same interests.

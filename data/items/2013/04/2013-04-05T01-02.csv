But you're right it definitely gets complicated, and you know way better than I do about which pieces are impossible and which aren't :)<p>The viewport query is a lot easier from an implementors point of view for sure, but it's also a lot less useful from a developer's point of view.<p>Would it be possible to have a way of only basing the element-specific query off of the state of the element before element-query-level styles had been applied?<p>For example, take an element that who's height is less than 100px. And say it has a query for `height > 80px` that hid a child element, which then kicked the element's height down to 75px. Technically the query would be undone, but maybe since it is a query-specific change, it doesn't factor in.<p>And it gets even more complicated when considering well what about a child's or parent's queries on top of that I'm sure.<p>All I know is while I'm writing these styles, I have very defined things that I want to do, that can be expressed in words perfectly clearly, and if I were able to express them in code it would completely solve tons of headaches I have with managing CSS.

And the more of an art it is, than a science.<p>The idea of 10x developers isn't that a single developer performs simple tasks 10x better/faster, but rather that they bring such insight into complex tasks, that they can wind up achieving 10x as much, possibly for the whole team, because they make other developers more productive as well. Or, they see a well-defined task, and see a different, better way of doing it, that only takes 1/10th the time.

Without salt they can try passwords and if the hash matches ANY in the system they know the password for those accounts.

I've been building my own app for back testing recently, my specific interest being how published insider buys (SEC Form 4 transactions) affect the prices of stocks in the short near and long term.  You can get dividend data and stock splits easily enough from some public feeds.  But where do you get a database of ticker changes, bankruptcy events, and spin-offs, especially on the OTC markets?  You can't unless you're willing to shell out a lot of money.  Back testing properly is probably out of the cost range of the individual investor.<p>Some examples:<p>* Lehhman's ticker changes on the way down<p>* GM going bankrupt and then coming back from the dead!<p>* Skye International used to trade under SKYY (at 0.35c/share), but now SKYY tracks a cloud SaaS ETF 20.60/share).

Nanobots could e.g. remove toxic compounds from extracellular areas and replace them with nontoxic solutions, and deliver yet-to-be-invented drugs that would activate upon thawing.<p>> Even biocompatible antifreeze proteins found in arctic oceans have a thermal threshold of 269K, which is no where near cryogenic temperature.<p>The stuff invented by 21st Century Medicine and used to successfully cryopreserve a rabbit kidney is a combination of the ordinary kind of penetrating antifreeze that depresses the freezing point (glycerol, EG, DMSO, and the like) with polymers that inhibit ice nucleation (functionally similar to antifreeze proteins). It has been known for a while that you can vitrify slowly by using high concentrations of the former kind of solute (depress the freezing temperature to below the glass transition temperature and the cooling rate no longer matters) but the latter lets you get away with somewhat more water in the mix, is my understanding.<p>There's a tradeoff when you cool things, where if you get cold enough it slows toxicity. They don't perfuse with the stuff until the brain is already cooled to near 0 degrees C, and it is ramped in concentration over time to prevent osmotic shock.",1365125996

Infact, they should be more scared.<p>You don't understand how partnerships work in this case. Facebook is paid to provide data according to a contract between the two companies. That's it. They have many, many such contracts to fulfill with many partners. These contracts don't say ""we provide exactly the data you ask for, no more, no less"" because that is a lot, lot more work and at the end of the day the contracts still get signed and FB still gets paid. A lot. Where do you see legal liability for FB so far? Their terms of service fully permit this data sharing, and the contracts are just between FB and partner companies.<p>Meanwhile, the partner companies use the shared data to produce value-added products which they provide to their customers under existing contracts and policies. They can't violate their customer's privacy or rights under any of the existing such policies, which are not identical to FB's. In fact, depending on the industry of the partner company, these policies can be extremely different. It is up to the partner company - <i>not Facebook</i> - to comply with the partner company's contracts/policies.<p>> I don't see any reason why Facebook would give away more information than they need to.<p>Facebook doesn't see any reason why they should waste time withholding more data than they need to. They still get paid the same amount, and the partner companies just filter out what they don't want. What's the point? There isn't even a big long-term concern here for Facebook, since extra social data isn't exactly very useful years later.<p>> They have the skill and resources to filter data themselves.<p>You say that, but every large technology company has to prioritize what they use engineering manpower for. Not everything a company can do or wants to do ends up getting done. For example, you might say ""Facebook has the skill and resources to delete data from their CDN. I highly doubt they would throw away money on byte stored in Akamai"" and yet they didn't do so for years and probably still don't. And that's a far easier problem with real measurable costs. Compare that to filtering the same enormous data set differently for each partner company when there's no compelling business reason to do so. The contracts are still going to be signed and Facebook will still get paid. Why should anyone care?<p>> I highly doubt that they would throw away personal and sensitive to other companies.<p>This is something FB is doing and have been doing for years. So your doubts are baseless.",1365125759

Said another way, breaking the rule would also require breaking some crypto.<p>Some rules, though, are social. For example, why does everyone try to extend the longest branch in the block chain? Sure, the protocol <i>says</i> it's the rule, but why should that mean anything? People don't follow rules because they want to. They follow rules because it's in their enlightened self interest to do so. If you could make money by choosing a different rule, somebody would do that instead. So it must be that these rules get followed because it's in the interest of Bitcoin players to follow them. The natural follow-up question is whether these social/economic rules are stable. That is, why not some other solution? Why not only extend blocks whose (nonce % 0x0d) == 0?<p>Cryptographers use a very particular notion of security in which they like the security of their schemes to ""reduce"" to a well-understood assumption. That is, we prefer it you can prove something like ""if you can break my system, then you can also solve problem X"" where problem X is well-known and widely thought to be very hard. Then either I am forced to believe that your system is secure or that you have found an efficient way to solve problem X. And since solving problem X is unlikely, I should consider your system secure.<p>As I said, some parts of Bitcoin <i>do</i> reduce in this way to known cryptographic primitives (which in turn reduce to problems we believe are hard).

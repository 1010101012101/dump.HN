It was such a big change that it pretty much ruined the reputation of the OS, single-handedly. I remember that one of the major complaints about Vista was the number and intrusiveness of UAC prompts, which occurred because programs were doing things like keeping settings in C:\Program Files, rather than the user&#x27;s application data folder.<p>Windows 7 has the same permissions model as Vista, but has a much better reputation, because by the time 7 was released, applications had been updated to not require as much in the way of permissions. From the users perspective, this meant that 7 &quot;worked properly&quot;, even though little had changed in terms of the security model between Vista and 7.",1447876780

That premise is that Python 2.7 people need to be somehow educated. To be shown some kind of light. It&#x27;s the same premise that the project leaders have been going on about for 7 years. &quot;Can&#x27;t you see how much better this is?&quot;. Worse: &quot;are you 2.7 people stupid, or what?&quot;.<p>It hasn&#x27;t worked.<p>Why hasn&#x27;t it worked? Not because 2.x people are slow or uninformed. They&#x27;re very well informed. They assess the merits and downsides. They&#x27;ve had 7 years!<p>The reason is a combination of inertia, but also, many people actually think that in many ways, 3.x is a <i>regression</i>. If you don&#x27;t need Unicode, Unicode is a huge pain in the xxxx. I was just having to mess with &quot;b&quot;s everywhere <i>today</i> on strings over msgpack to a non-pythonic endpoint. Lazy ranges (can also be) a huge pain in the b<i></i>t. So I must move to 3.5. For what? Type annotations? Asyncio?

Okay cool. You wait. I won&#x27;t.<p>So the advances of 3 meet the regressions of 3. Even if you believe the net is positive in 3&#x27;s favour, that net is not nearly enough to persuade people with actual lives outside of computer science, to port years of code, and more importantly, to port their brains to work with the new dispensation.

But the point Mossberg makes in the article indirectly (or perhaps inadvertently) is that ARM and Linux have crushed the margins out of low end CPUs and operating systems (with a bit of help on OS pricing from Apple).<p>The insight here is that the two most expensive &quot;parts&quot; of a PC have always been the CPU and the OS license. Intel derived fat margins on their CPUs as the only game in town (sometimes illegally hindering rivals) and Microsoft derived fat margins by being the only OS worth having given the breadth of software available for it. The combination, the so called Win-Tel hegemony, was dominant for years.<p>And the tricky bit is that typical mark-up for a hardware device was 3 - 4x the price of the parts to build it. That multiple takes into account things like warranty returns, unsold inventory, losses in shipment, and two channels of distribution mark up. So priced at X the device sells for 1.4X to distributors, and then 3x to consumers. But the interesting side effect there is that every $1 you take off the price of components is $3 less at the consumer level.<p>As ARM chips got more capable, and Linux became more acceptable, I mark the beginning of the end as the day Asus shipped its first NetBook running Linux in 2007, and then tried to ship an ARM powered laptop a year later.<p>That stunt allowed ASUS to wrangle a nearly zero cost Windows XP license for its Netbooks from Microsoft. And the Atom chip, which Intel was pushing for &quot;embedded&quot; applications against the fast growing ARM franchise, had the lowest margins yet for a GenuineIntel processor.<p>With margins on the CPU and OS under assault, the whole value chain began to normalize around the minimum quality cost of the components. Combine that with the advancement of capability with process shrinks at the same price, and eventually the processors you could use would have the same capabilities as the &quot;high end&quot; ones did back in 2007.<p>The net result has been that things like the Raspberry Pi are possible, a $35 dollar computer that out performs machines from the turn of the century, but were reasonably useful. And now the &quot;cheap&quot; stuff has gotten into the performance ranges of the &quot;performant&quot; stuff from 2006, the year everyone stopped buying new computers every year because they didn&#x27;t have to.<p>Today you have ChromeOS and Ubuntu Unity and Firefox OS and a number of interesting alternatives that are free or mostly so, and 64 bit ARM processors which sell for less than a 1/3 what the same performance 64 bit x86 processor sells for. And the collateral damage of that is you can put together a pretty capable unit for not a lot of money. Tether it to a $10 phone from Walmart and its really amazing.",1447875483

By search & job stats [1], the most popular programming languages are Java, C, C++, C#, and yep, Python.  Companies tend to pick whatever language is best for early adopters when they first get started and then language usage grows along with the company.  So the most popular languages <i>now</i> are the ones that were cutting edge 15 years ago, when the biggest companies of today were tiny startups.  Go look at what&#x27;s most popular among startups today and you&#x27;ll see what&#x27;ll be the hot programming languages in 15 years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a>",1447875044

I could have studied hard since 9 years old, skipped high school and be a PhD now or something, but then I&#x27;d probably talk with some people and start regretting that I haven&#x27;t the time to read the books and watch the movies that could have shaped my imagination.<p>So the real advice is - instead of obsessing over the road not taken, focus on what comparative advantage you got from your experiences.

Identify a goal that contributes directly to useful output (e.g. shipping a product to actual users, making a sale, etc)<p>2. List the steps necessary to reach this goal.  Make sure the steps are listed sequentially and that each step is actually necessary to achieve the next one.  Eliminate &quot;nice-to-have&quot; steps or &quot;targets of opportunity.&quot;<p>3. Do those steps, and postpone everything else.  If some other tasks starts nagging on you, just put it off and tell yourself that you can do that after you finish the sequence of steps.

In the mathematical sense, 1+1=2 is true because (a) it is a well-formed sentence in a certain formal system and (b) there exists a proof of it in that formal system. The formal system consists of a grammar for well-formed sentences as well as rules for deriving true sentences.<p>The key point here is that the definition of &quot;true&quot; is part of the definition of the formal system. Unlike in philosophy, we have a clear and unambiguous definition of what &quot;true&quot; means, and its evaluation does not depend on properties of our physical universe.[0]<p>So when people say that &quot;mathematical theorems are true in all possible universes&quot;, they&#x27;re well-intentioned but I would argue that they are misleading. The deeper (philosophical) truth is that the (mathematical) truth of mathematical theorems is <i>independent of</i> universes[1].<p>[0] The fact that our minds are drawn to thinking about the specific type of formal systems that are usually considered to be reasonable foundations for mathematics may well be a consequence of the properties of our physical existence.[2] However, if by some magic the definitions of formal systems studied by alien civilizations in a different physical universe were to be transmitted to us, we would be able to arrive at the same conclusions about those systems as the aliens, and vice versa. There would be no disagreement about what sentences are true in such an alien formal system.<p>[1] Where I use the word &quot;universe&quot; in the physical sense and not in the sense that is found in set theory and its ilk.<p>[2] However, I personally don&#x27;t think so. I believe (though I cannot prove it) that something like the Church-Turing hypothesis also applies to foundational formal systems at least up to basic set theory (possibly minus the axiom of choice). It is conceivable that some alien civilization in a much stranger universe would consider a certain extension of our set theory as the natural choice for mathematical foundations, but they would recognize our set theory as a subset of what they&#x27;re studying.",1447873763

The first was the Static Driver Verifier.[1] That&#x27;s the formal proof-of-correctness system that checks the source code for a driver for termination, bad pointers, incorrect API calls, and anything that could result in a kernel crash.  It&#x27;s a symbolic path tracer - it symbolically executes all paths through the code.  All drivers must pass that verifier. Before this was deployed, about half of Windows crashes were due to drivers.  Now, very few are.<p>The other technology was a classifier for panic dumps.  When Windows crashes and reports data to Microsoft, that data goes into a classifier system which tries to cluster similar crashes together. So, when there&#x27;s a crash bug, the reports of similar crashes are all looked at by the same person at the same time, which tends to get it fixed.<p>Linux lacks either technology, which is a problem.<p>[1] <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff552808%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff...</a>",1447873649

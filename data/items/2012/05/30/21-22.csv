You just keep your data in the process address space<p>The Windows NT kernel is primarily a filesystem-backed address space for committed RAM. Originally you actually had to have a pagefile at least as large as physical RAM. Except for nonpageable kernel structures, all the program accessible RAM was part of a memory-mapped file. [[EDIT: There's plenty of text from Microsoft that implies this, (e.g. ""you should set the size of the paging file to the same size as your system RAM plus 12 MB...because Windows NT requires ""backing storage"" for everything it keeps in RAM"") however, offline discussions have convinced me that it was never strictly true.]]<p>This was back when drive capacity was ""more larger"" than RAM capacity and disk bandwith was ""less slower"". The kernel has evolved away from this design a bit, but it did bring a certain purity. For example the filesytem cache and virtual memory paging system could be largely the same thing.<p>> You just keep your data in the process address space - its just not going to go anywhere. Just make a data segment persistent across processes and you can survive restarts.<p>This more or less what happens when the kernel bluescreens and the page file was at least as large as RAM. It makes debugging kernel crashes easier. (Spare me the Windows jokes please I'm not advocating for it, just saying this part of it that no one ever sees had a relatively elegant design opposite to what crazy futurist rant suggests.)",1338414803

That covers most of the mainstream religions, but I'm sure you could gerrymander your own personal belief system to avoid my definition. I don't claim they're identical, just that they're wrong because it's logically impossible to be true. And my point is that there are some programmers who understand logic and should be able to think their way out of believing logically impossible dogmas, but they don't, because they're mentally compartmentalized and intellectually dishonest.<p>Brendan Eich for example should be smart and logical enough to figure out that gay people marrying don't effect his own marriage or harm society. Yet he gave $1000 to the Proposition 8 campaign which successfully overturned the right to gay marriage in California, so his money had a negative effect on real people's lives.

You have to be reasonably intelligent to do well in the programming game, and usually people become pretty critical and questioning and skeptical in the process, and outgrow the bigotry (even if they do occasionally have social awkwardness and cluelessness).<p>It is disappointing when that doesnt turn out to be as true as one thought.""",1338414596

4045024,comment,4044674,4044674,6,0,zred,,,"1. The same is true of share-nothing architectures in Ruby, Python, Perl, Java, or C# (including Rails and Django).  All you have to do is get more app servers - no fuss.  Of course, the hard thing is scaling the data store which is something PHP (or other language) users will still face.<p>2. I don't think PHP is any easier than Python or Ruby - in fact, in many ways I consider it more difficult personally.  There may be a higher number of people that advertise PHP skills, but many of them are people that can cut and paste and keep futzing until something mostly works in WordPress.  That's not really the kind of programmer you want (at any price).<p>3. PHP has some nice built-ins for the web - including session/cookie handling, the $_GET and $_POST hashes, etc.  However, when I use Python, Ruby, or Java, I get these things via a framework (even a microframework).  Yes, one of PHP's strengths is that it includes a microframework that handles basic routing, session handling, and request information.  However, all of that is available in other languages.<p>4. Whether it's Django, Rails, or another framework, I find that an error in one request doesn't propagate to the next.  It's interesting how the author hedges and says, ""well, when it does get borked, it's your fault rather than PHP's"".  So, PHP never fails for more than one request, unless it does in which case it's your fault.  That's hard to argue against since it doesn't mean anything.<p>5. None of PHP's frameworks seem as mature as those available in Python, Ruby, C#, and Java and I think part of it is due to the fact that PHP is by itself a microframework.<p>6. PHP.net does have great docs and they're all nicely in a prominent location.  However, one really needs better docs to compensate for poor design.  For example, when dealing with PHP strings, do you put the needle or the haystack first?  The answer is that it depends on the function.  preg_match is needle first, strstr is haystack first.  That brings up another inconsistency: should words be separated by an underscore?  The answer is again that it depends.  Every language has its warts, but PHP is known for being inconsistent.<p>7. PHP does have a bunch written about it, but it also has a lot of noise.  There's a lot written by people who don't quite know what they're doing, but were able to cut and paste code and futz until it worked.<p>8. The same could be said of almost any community.  It's easy to say that there's always people to help since it can't be quantified or argued against.<p>9. PHP does have good support for many things, but it lacks a modules system.  Python has PyPI, Ruby has RubyGems, Java has Maven, and Perl has CPAN.  PHP does support a lot of things, but you've provided no evidence that it supports more things than any other language (MongoDB, Pusher, and memcached are supported in many languages and those are the only things you used as examples).<p>10. Many languages are dynamically typed, but PHP is also weakly typed.  Sometimes this is fine, but it can also be a pain and introduce subtle bugs from implicit type casting.<p>11. I think that many of us have chosen other languages because we believe we get things done faster in them.  Writing an application isn't just getting the proof of concept out the door.  It's about long-term productivity.<p>If you like PHP, great for you!  I hope you're productive and enjoy using it.  However, none of these reasons really ring as valid.  PHP is not more scalable.  PHP includes a microframework that you don't have to choose beyond the language, but that's not really something that interesting given that frameworks exist for most languages.  Via a library, most languages have as good support for the web as PHP has - sometimes better (in my opinion).  And the idea that PHP's popularity on the low end makes it an attractive option just seems like a bad argument.<p>Finally, the author says that PHP is where it's at for the web for the next 5 years (at least).  However, what is launching around now and using PHP?  Instagram was Python (Django).  Quora wasn't PHP.  FriendFeed was Python and Facebook seems to have moved away from PHP except for its legacy front-end.  Google, Microsoft, and Apple don't use PHP.  Pinterest is Python and Django.  Twitter is a mix of Ruby and Scala.  Github is Rails, BitBucket is Django.  Groupon is Rails.  Again, just because someone else is doing something isn't a reason to do it.  However, if the author is arguing that PHP is the language of the next 5 years, I'd argue that it isn't the language of today.<p>When Facebook launched, Rails and Django didn't exist; .NET MVC didn't exist; Play! didn't exist.  In some ways, Facebook seems to be the last big pre-Rails site.  That doesn't mean that newer sites always use frameworks (or that some frameworks didn't exist before then).  However, new and popular frameworks burst onto the scene in 2004 and 2005.  It changed our web development community.  Since that time, I think we've seen new projects using other languages a lot more than PHP.  Again, I can't emphasize enough that just because someone is doing something doesn't make it good for you.  However, if the author is going to claim that PHP is the language of the day, I'm going to refute it.  That doesn't mean that you can't build good things with PHP, but I think that a lot of us are using other tools.",1338413679

One of them led to being acquihired at a funded startup in the same area. It was a lot easier when there was one kid. Now with 3, like yourself, I find it's near impossible to get any kind of consistent focus. However, I know the hours are usually there, so that's my problem more than anything.<p>However, I will say this. If you're thinking about starting a startup on the side, don't. That's my advice, don't do it.  If you're a young hacker without kids, make a full-time go at it. If you've already got kids, save until you can.

A bar sells drinks, but providing a competitive lineup of drinks is much easier than providing a competitive context in which to consume them.  Coffee shops sell coffee and wifi, but they compete against each other as contexts within which to consume coffee and wifi.  As a photo sharing app, what distinguishes Facebook from its competitors is the context it provides.<p>The context is nothing by itself, of course, and this is what is rarely mentioned about social networking.  A bar without drinks would be dry and boring:  a Boys and Girls Club for adults.  Similarly, the essential, defining factor of social networking -- the network, the web of connections between people -- is lame and reductive by itself.

I wager that when google glass is launched, it will be a cultural icon no more than 1.5 years later.<p>It's clear WHY google needs glass.  Owning the channel between my eyes and the world is a huge potential pot of money.  Targeted ads have a lot of potential to disrupt the ad space, and if facebook ever decides to make their own ad network (such as Google's ad sense) competition will be fierce.  Google glass is a really good way to increase their competitive advantage, and cement their position in the advertising arena.<p>Additionally, of the companies that would be interested in making a product like google glass (facebook, microsoft, IBM etc) Google probably has the best mix of engineers to do it.  I've always said that Google is an AI company first.  Well a huge part of AI is machine vision, and a large part of successfully monetizing google glass is machine vision.  Additionally, with street view, and other aggressive initiatives Google is in one of the best positions to actually understand what and where the world you are looking at.  Finally, while google has proven in the past they are weak as a hardware company (nexus 1) they have demonstrated they are capable of bringing a consumer product to the mass market... though perhaps maybe not enough to make it anything less then a wild card.<p>Finally the last point is one of consumer adoption.  The newton pad was not successful in part because the hardware was premature.  But I would speculate it was also in part because consumers weren't at the point of understanding the value.  The hardware in Google glass is unknown at this point, and potentially could under-deliver... and that will cause it to be a newton.. but for the reasons i said above I think Google is capable of delivering a quality product.  However consumer readiness will not be an issue.  1 billion people are already on Facebook.  Social interaction through technology is accepted today more then ever before.  Using smartphones in public is not only accepted, its normal.  Years ago using a PDA might have made you look like a yuppie, but today no one would notice.",1338412934

Here we go!<p><i>PHP is stupid easy to scale</i><p>So is every other programming language.  The hard part is scaling your centralized database.  Considering most people using PHP are writing applications backed by a single SQL database, it's a bit disingenuous to call the language ""shared nothing"".  While true, it's completely meaningless and true of literally every programming language ever.<p>It's like saying, ""English makes it really easy to tell love stories.""<p><i>I wont need experts  If the event that my new ventures grow and I need to hire on more programmers I do not need the best and brightest to get the job done.</i><p>True of any language.  I can hire people that are bad at programming any language, cheaply.<p>The deeper problem is that PHP makes it tough to multiply effort by creating good abstractions, so there is a lot of repetitive grunt-work that's best outsourced to a country where people are happy making five bucks an hour.<p><i>It is tied to the web</i><p>""PHP doesn't work very well when not serving web pages, so I use it to serve web pages.""  The tautology department called, they want their tautology department back.<p><i>When it fails, it doesnt fail hard</i><p>I am not sure what this means.  Each request is handled by a single UNIX process.  That's, again, how the author happens to architect applications, not an intrinsic (or unique) property of PHP.<p><i>Other languages need a lot of plumbing to handle that.</i><p>Citation needed.  This is standard CGI that's been around since the 80s.<p><i>There are a plethora of frameworks to chose from</i><p>That's fine.  Again true of any language.  Even Common Frickin' Lisp has several frameworks.<p><i>Best documentation on the web</i><p>The author does not explain why, only that he wishes he could log in with his Twitter account to propose changes.  (What ever happened to emailing the author?)<p><i>Tons of blogs</i><p>True of everything, from programming languages to pictures of cats.<p><i>The PHP Community</i><p>True of pretty much every language I've ever encountered.  Even C.<p>I like the Perl community best because of the infrastructure that the members build for each other.  Want to get an email when your module's tests fail on HP-UX?  Someone has built a service for that.<p>Answering questions is nice, but that's the tip of the community iceberg.<p><i>It integrates with everything</i><p>I read this as: ""PHP has a socket API.""<p><i>Dynamic typing</i><p>I'm just going to quote this one verbatim because I can't come up with anything more hilarious:<p><i>But how do you know if youre working with an int or a string?  By using your brain.  HTTP does not do typing and so PHP does not do (strong) typing for scalars.  Quite frankly, it makes complete sense to do it that way.  Want an int?  Cast the damn thing and stop complaining.  Dynamic typing significantly reduces the amount of code you need to write and error conditions you need to check for.\nIt plain works  Programmers have it wrong.  The technical solution is not the end goal.  Technology should be an enabler.  Do you have a wonderful technical solution that doesnt solve a problem?  Bye, bye.  PHP solves problems faster, easier and with a lower cost of ownership than almost anything out there.  A lot of that is based on assumptions (or shortcuts) that PHP takes to solve a problem.  Most often those shortcuts work, and the workarounds are very easy to implement (Im thinking mainly about strict type checking here).</i><p>Little does the author know that you can have dynamic typing in any statically-typed language:<p><pre><code>   /** Immutable scalar value. */\n   public final class Scalar {\n\n       private final Integer intValue;  // not int so that ""null"" is meaningful\n       private final String stringValue;\n\n       public Scalar(String string) {\n           stringValue = string;\n       }\n\n       public Scalar(int i) {\n           intValue = new Integer(i);\n       }\n\n       public String toString() {\n           if (stringValue == null) {\n               fixupString();\n           }\n           return stringValue;\n       }\n\n       public int toInt() {\n           if (intValue == null) {\n               fixupInteger();\n           }\n           return intValue.intValue();\n       }\n\n       private void fixupString() {\n           stringValue = intValue.toString();\n       }\n\n       private void fixupInteger() {\n           intValue = Integer.parseInt(stringValue);\n       }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAll PHP adds are operators like + that are typed Scalar -> Scalar instead of Number -> Number, making up arbitrary behavior for non-numeric values.  If you wanted dynamic typing in Java, you would just write a special math library over your Scalar type and write your application in terms of those operations instead of the built-in ones.  The reason nobody does that is because the static typing, though verbose, makes for nice self-documentation.<p>At some point you need to decide on a type for a value and most people try to do that as soon as possible.  When I write in a dynamically typed language that's not Python, I usually assert well-formedness immediately after reading the data from outside my program.  At that point, dynamic typing is a <i>loss</i> in safety to me.   (When I write Python, I never explicitly check types and let mistyped operations fail at runtime, because that's the convention.)<p>Anyway, that was a fun article.",1338412645

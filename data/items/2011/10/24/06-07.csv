Suddenly, you didn't have to choose which music to take with you, it was already all there in the device. Suddenly, you could take your music player when you went jogging, because the music would never skip. Suddenly, you wouldn't have to worry about damaging your CDs, you would always have a copy.

And he would be right because iTunes became the largest seller of music, to the point that artists no longer sell CDs as much anymore, it's all piecemeal mp3s.<p>In terms of Google search and maps, I would also intepret Jobs saying that it has good functionality, but what made it great was tying it together with the iPhone.  If you watch the famous 2007 interview with Jobs and Gates at the allthingsd conference, he mentions how they showed Google Maps to the Google engineers and they were blown away at how much more useful it was using the iPhone.  The iPhone completely transformed the experience, and brought it to a new level, which is what he predicted the iPhone would do.  And if you listen to what Marissa Mayer said earlier this year, 2011 was the year when more mobile users used Google Maps than desktop users.  Google maps is a completely different experience with a smartphone, and it's those sort of transformational, humanity-targeted aspects that I believe Jobs was going for, not just engineering functionality.",1319439210

I was amazed when I first held Palm and WinMo devices, they were the dawning of an era for me. But I don't go writing completely uninformed posts all over the interwebs about it. These articles about Steve Jobs' rant against android makes him look like a complete fool and a hypocrite.<p>Why was it a model of what not to do? So much of what I see in todays' android/iphone/WP7 features remind me of the power of WinMo of yesteryear. WinMo was a superb system, and seeing that it went barely unchanged for nearly a decade proves this. This was simultaneously it's biggest downfall and Microsoft left it to late to update and they got left behind.<p>What does microsoft abandoning WinMo tell me?

These technologies, Ritchie's in particular, are what make Apple products, and in Ritchie's case very near all other computer products, possible to build <i>at all</i>.<p>There is the Jobs type of innovation, where you integrate work in a useful and pleasing way. Then there is the academic version of innovation, where you are creating or extending the foundations of our collective knowledge. These are hardly comparable.<p>Many of us find the latter to be far more of a challenge than the former. That's not to say that doing the sort of work that Apple did was at all easy! But beyond such subjective opinions, the real discord that bothers some of us is that the academic type contributions are every bit as important as the contributions of Jobs, yet often go completely unnoticed, or worse, their successes are misattributed up the chain to people like Jobs.<p>These people deserve every bit as much praise, but usually get none. So Dennis Ritchie died recently. There were some mentions in the news. But by and large Jobs death is dominating the scene. Ritchie's work has arguably touched far more people. It's sad, but I suppose it's human nature to sing the praises of a few at the expense of the rest.<p>That said, Jobs was a hugely influential person as well and certainly deserves respect. We just need to remember that there are others that also deserve the same sort of respect. The quiet heros.",1319438478

3148504,comment,3147452,3148424,5,0,bane,,,">you seem to put a lot of thought into what is on people's resumes.<p>I actually really don't. I screen resumes pretty quick and just check for a few things. Can they format their resume like a grownup? Does the information appear to be accurate? Does it show relevant skills for the position we're looking for? Does it show an upwards career progression? Are their any oddball things that I'd like to talk with them about (work gaps, unusual education path vs. career, a stint overseas, an unusually short time at a previous employer) etc.<p>>Resumes exist to secure job interviews.<p>Then I'd ask, what's the point? Just build a quick site to collect people's names, phone numbers and email addresses, call it ""apply for a job with Matasano"" and be done with it? If it's not important at all in your process, why are you wasting your and the candidates time?<p>>but I didn't find that out until after we had hired.<p>Hell, why do you even interview them? Just check that they have a pulse and valid residency paperwork.<p>I'm sitting here reading this really rather incredulous that you couldn't be bothered to even ask this during the interview process, or as part of the basic job application paperwork.<p>Perhaps I'm colored because I do tend to do lots of hiring for contract work and my clients <i>do</i> need that information or we've just hired a wallet to toss money into that won't be doing much productive for us except burning overhead.<p>>it is 2011, and for at least the least 18 months, it has been a white hot competitive market for talent<p>Disagree, it's very strongly an employers market right now, the market is saturated with relatively qualified people looking for work. For every position we open, we get a couple hundred resumes. It makes it very easy to be picky at every stage of the interview process. Resume screening is just step 1. The interview process is absolutely critical to step 2 I agree.<p>I've seen many many horribly broken interview processes, all kinds of clever tests, and Microsoft style quiz questions. Really just having a long conversation with a candidate, treating them as a person and letting them talk about their career, with some guiding questions is about it. If it's a technical position, get some code samples, and talk them through some relevant scenarios or algorithm questions or whatever makes sense.<p>All of the best hires I've ever gotten flew past those 2 steps.<p>And I swear to all that's holy I agree that Monster.com is <i>not</i> the place to go as an employer or as a job hunter. Ugh, pile of failure that whole site is these days.<p>> ""look, Bob! this candidate listed 'coursework in computational linguistics'! if he couldn't hack it to a degree, he'd never hack it here!""<p>I have to go 80/20 against/with you on this. Degrees are easy compared to real life work - shockingly so. If somebody can't finish a degree program with nothing in particular stopping them on what basis should I trust that they can finish a multi-million dollar project under tremendous pressure? You aren't going to figure that out no matter how clever the interview is if they don't have the prior history.<p>All that being said, I do have experience with self-taught guys who really are very good. But they need to have something else that makes up for it, a really amazing interview, some kind of really spectacular past performance or even amazing personal hobby portfolio that shows off their skillset. But theses guys are <i>very</i> rare. And all of them put ""High School"" under their education section on their resume. But then they have amazing portfolios of work to compensate.<p>Sometimes the education section can be an important marker to show upward progression over a career. For example, somebody who went to school later in life, or went back for a Masters or PhD or some such.<p>Sometimes they demonstrate odd ways you might be able to use a person. For example, you might be hiring for a sales position, and get a resume for somebody with a degree in Literature. Awesome, I bet you can talk to them about improving your company's advertising copy which would help them hawk your stuff better. Or maybe they are a self taught programmer with an Art degree. Super! Maybe they can provide good insight into improving a product's look.<p>So yeah, if they can't be bothered to put <i>something</i> down on the resume about where they got their learnin' from, I ain't interested in the least.<p>I'm not going to say that 100% of my hires are the best and the brightest.

People who are smart but work cr-p jobs because they lack the social skills or confidence to advance make great employees for your small side businesses.    And the great thing about that is I'm helping my friend while I'm exploiting him or her.   Most of the people I've hired in this manner have gone on to get ""real jobs"" after gaining experience working for me.<p>Of course, all this is predicated on your ability to live a different lifestyle from your friends, and being willing to fire a friend.

We have all the facts we could ever need, and it's gotten easier and easier to locate them. This major barrier to being an intellectual, historically provided by academia, is almost completely gone.</i><p>I agree the internet makes it even easier, but access to raw facts hasn't <i>really</i> been a barrier for decades, if not a century, at least in the United States. The average person has long had access to a ton of information they simply didn't use, via libraries, especially in major cities with good library systems. You occasionally read about people even some decades ago who became experts in a field by just sitting in the New York public library reading all the books on the subject they could get their hands on, but it's not the usual case. Many university libraries are open to the public as well, but most of the public doesn't take them up on that offer, either.<p>Maybe the internet will be what changes that, but I have some doubts. My guess is that the people who will use information on the internet to truly become experts on a subject overlap heavily with the kinds of people who, 50 years ago, would've been in the library becoming experts on the subject (though it's probably the case that there will be more of them).<p>If anything, the library is probably still a better resource, at least for now. If someone wants to learn physics on their own, to the point where they could really be an expert in some area, grabbing a bunch of the best physics books they can find and reading them cover-to-cover is going to get them there faster than reading physics blogs and Wikipedia will (though blogs and Wikipedia do have some quite good information, and are good for keeping up on recent advances).",1293697822

My understanding is that linode has better disk I/O than I do because they have a process in place for limiting heavy disk users.  (my understanding is that it's a good process, they warn you before limiting you and generally do it in a fair manner.  I plan on emulating them in this regard. )<p>No two ways around it; I/O to spinning disk and virtualization go together poorly.   What would have been a sequential access on a dedicated server becomes random access... and on a good day, that means 1/10th the performance.<p>If you are using a lot of disk I/O, a dedicated server is about your only option.  Considering the prices nearly all American providers charge, if you plan on keeping it for more than 2 months, you are nearly always better off buying.  (and that way you can buy better disk, too.)<p>Of course, if you aren't limited by I/O, or if you can solve the I/O problem using ram caches, then it might make sense to stay 'in the cloud' on linode or ec2 or the like until you are sure you are going to need the space long-term.",1293696887

Around me it have been the more idealistic ones that join or start a startup, and for very different reasons than getting rich. e.g. feeling that they can be more valuable here than in corporate, wanting to create something new, etc. (all the normal reasons for start-ups, MBAs are no different)<p>disclaimer: I have an MBA, and I did apply to Mondo (did not work out, but no hard feelings), and I usually don&#x27;t daydream about making a billion dollars",1452783598

I look at the team, the market size, the product. Team is especially important.<p>1. What are the bosses&#x27; background? Someone who worked at Facebook will have an entirely different approach than a management consultant. Sniff out culture and make sure it suits you. People&#x27;s work and personal habits are very different - this is where you tell the two.<p>2. Look at the org chart. Organization charts are like software architecture. There is no &quot;best&quot; org chart; just what it&#x27;s optimized for. If it insists on being a flat heirarchy, assume that it&#x27;s an anarchy. You just want to make sure that they respect your role.<p>For example, one company has sales, marketing (separate from sales), finance, operations. Operations is then split into logistics, IT. Product development is squished under IT. This is likely a bad company for engineers. Likewise, I&#x27;ve seen companies where at least 50% of the budget is engineering.<p>3. What is the value of your role? If you make $100k, how are you contributing $200k to your company annually? If you find that you can only contribute $30k or that the position is worthless in a year, that&#x27;s a red flag.<p>4. Growth rate. If a company&#x27;s profit is doubling every year, there will be much less bureaucracy and politics.<p>5. Sniff out bullshit. I ready the most uncomfortable questions I can find. Why aren&#x27;t they hitting a good growth rate? Why are they hiring so many people on $1M of funding? If they give you an honest &quot;Uhh.. well.. I don&#x27;t know,&quot; that&#x27;s fine.

10901703,comment,10897211,10901203,0,0,JohnTHaller,,,"Security updates and the ability to run the latest OS are very different things, especially in Mac-land.  Unlike Windows software which generally runs on a very wide range of versions, most Mac apps assume users are only running more recent releases.  For example, Firefox runs Windows versions up to 14 years ago (Windows XP, which isn&#x27;t even supported by Microsoft any more) but only on Mac OS X within the last 6 years (OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard).  Couple that with the fact that it is very difficult to determine when Apple drops support for a given version of OS X because they have no published schedule and don&#x27;t officially announce when they drop support of a specific version.  In short, the equivalent 2008 Windows laptop is still getting security updates for the OS it came with, works with nearly all major Windows software, and can be updated to the latest version of Windows without much fuss.  The 2008 Macbook is running an unsupported version of OS X, can&#x27;t be upgraded to the current version of OS X, and can&#x27;t run quite a lot of Mac software.<p>Windows vs Mac resale value plays a lot into the way Windows folks use their laptops.  The reason is that they generally use a given laptop until they no longer need it.  My girlfriend&#x27;s laptop will be 5 years old this year and was purchased for about the same amount of money it cost you to use your Macbook for 3 years.  I spent another ~US$100 to upgrade to an SSD recently which will give it quite a bit more life.  And it can be upgraded to Windows 10 for free if we want to at some point. Granted, it&#x27;s only used for web browsing, office suite stuff, watching videos, recording and editing voice-over work etc, so it doesn&#x27;t need to be the latest and greatest.  So, it&#x27;s really more a different use case.<p>Your typical pattern of buy and sell is kind of fascinating to me as a Windows user, but makes complete sense given the comparable markets and models.  The wider array of Windows laptop choices in different budgets accounts for the lower resale value of higher end Windows laptops. Most users are fine spending $400 or less on a Windows laptop for the basic browsing, email, photos, videos, etc needs.  High end Windows laptop users want a new machine, not a used one.  So, there&#x27;s not much interest in $500 used Windows laptops... they don&#x27;t serve either market segment well.  In Mac-land, there is no $400-500 Mac laptop option, so anyone with only that budget has to look at used models.  Thus, the demand keeps the cost for a used Macbook high compared to Windows laptops.<p>In the end, I think we&#x27;re both doing it right for our needs :)",1452783259

Although, working at a place where we have 3D video walls with head tracking for quite some time you still can call me a sceptic.<p>We only use them for presentations, the reason imo is that mechanical CAD modeling is really not just about creating 3D representations. An engineer works on math, tables (excel is big in engineering), enterprise resource management systems (you look up available material, prices, etc.), PIM software and of course the browser.  You switch between them a lot. As far I can tell, the resolution of both Oculus and HTC Vive isn’t suited for editing larger texts or tables efficiently.<p>Time (or better the VR industry) will solve this issue, but even then I’d argue many engineers prefer hand drawn sketches to support their thinking or for communicating ideas with their colleagues.<p>While I’m sceptic concerning the use of VR for every day engineering, I believe it will be fantastic to let non-engineers explore designs. Like a production worker analyzing a design for assembly friendliness, where he can take apart the design without learning the right mouse-keyboard interactions or get used to a 3d motion controllers.

There were arguments for reincarnation, which Buddhism clarifies as rebirth without an eternal soul, as well as for eternalism (ie you go to heaven forever if you&#x27;re good) and annihilationism (ie you die and that&#x27;s it, no more existence), both of which the Buddha explicitly refuted.",1452783065

This is also true if you worked at a place that is small, but not a startup.<p>The best decision I made in my career was to ride the 2003 recession in a small catalog company that wrote its own code and wanted to grow. Since they were that small, I had responsibilities that had nothing to do with what people of my experience had to do in big companies.  I was making stack and architectural decisions quickly. Since we didn&#x27;t have an army of people, I had to do infrastructure, project proposals, requirements gathering, database administration, and decisions on stack changes. We just couldn&#x27;t afford specialists. My pay was not exactly competitive, but when I left for a bigger company, I had major advantages over my coworkers, because I had such a breadth of experience compared to them, pigeonholed in roles that did a lot less, and never had to care about what was good for the business, just doing what the next guy in the totem pole said. Your idea of big bucks might be different from mine, but making over 300k in the Midwest sounds pretty good to me.<p>And it&#x27;s not just my story: The rest of the people in that team are all doing extremely well. One is a senior architect in a cloud provider. Another is a pretty big conference speaker. The last one is the top technical gun in a consulting firm. All my friends that didn&#x27;t take risks to go for better experience are doing far less interesting work, for far less money.<p>That said, a startup just makes it easier to get a job that teaches the right things. If all you end up doing is writing a web app in Rails, you might as well do that in a bigger place that pays better. It&#x27;s not really about the office being cool, or thinking the company has a good chance at making it, but about finding ways to get a competitive advantage over other developers for the long haul.",1452782747

Not particularly.<p>There&#x27;s an incredible amount of churn in the web languages/frameworks arena. A few years ago it seemed like every week another PHP &quot;MVC&quot; framework was released with exactly the same features as the last one, but with claims that it was faster, more robust, more extensible, and so on. At one point the &quot;big players&quot; were CakePHP and CodeIgniter. Now they seem to be Symfony and Laravel, but feature-wise there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a huge amount of difference to how your application is structured in these particular frameworks.<p>Now the churn seems to have shifted away from PHP to JS and JS build systems, and lo and behold we have Imba, &quot;a new programming language for the web&quot;.<p>Sometimes these tools offer clear advantages, other times not so. But often the lifespan on these seems to be less than a year. Everyone is excited about Backbone for six months, until Ember comes out and now no one talks about Backbone. But then Angular comes out and no-one talks about Ember. Investing time in learning any new tool can feel like a huge waste of time when there&#x27;s a high chance that said tool will disappear a year or so down the line.<p>Moving this away from the land of web, a new language should at the very least offer a new perspective on something, for example Rust&#x27;s approach to memory management is intriguing enough for it to potentially be worthwhile.<p>I like learning new skills and techniques. A language with a different syntax and some sugar-coating that is fundamentally the same as something I already know isn&#x27;t that.<p>But maybe I&#x27;m just bitter ;)",1452782297

The creators have abandoned it, and the surviving maintainer support is of the &quot;pull requests welcome&quot; variety. There are glaring bugs in basic features like inline eval, and maintainer response was a combination of &quot;eh, we&#x27;re cutting that feature anyway&quot; and &quot;fix it yourself.&quot;<p>Sure as hell doesn&#x27;t give me any hope that this &quot;Eve&quot; thing their hyping is anything but smoke and mirrors.",1452780105

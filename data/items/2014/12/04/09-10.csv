8698565,comment,8697772,8697772,0,0,infinity,,,"One way to approach your wishes to learn &quot;mathematics from first principles&quot; is to see modern mathematics as the study and application of formal systems:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system</a><p>A formal system has several components:<p>An alphabet of symbols from which sequences or strings of symbols are constructed. Some of these strings of symbols can be well-formed according to some formal grammar, which is the next component.<p>Next we have a collection of basic assumptions, called axioms, which are supposed to reflect the obvious truths about whatever we want to formalize in the formal system.<p>And then we have some rules of inference. They allow us to derive conclusions from premises. An example would be the rule of modus ponens: If we have &quot;If A then B&quot; and &quot;A&quot;, we can conclude &quot;B&quot;.<p>An example of a formal system is ZFC set theory which can be regarded as a formalization of one concept, the concept of a set:<p>We take &quot;classical predicate logic&quot; as a background formal system, it already has logical symbols, like symbols for AND, OR and &quot;IF ... THEN ...&quot; and quantifiers &quot;FOR ALL ...&quot; and &quot;THERE EXISTS ...&quot;.<p>We enhance this logic with one non-logical symbol, the binary element-of-symbol ∈. With it we want to express the idea that something is an element of something, for example x ∈ y is supposed to mean that x is an element of y.<p>Of course this is a bit simplified, but now we can build expressions (with symbols from the alphabet, according to the grammar for logical formulas plus the element symbol) which talk about the element-of-relationship between individuals.<p>Next, we sit together at a round table and discuss which properties about sets and element-of or membership of a set we see as self-evident - there is room for discussion and there can be many different intuitions.<p>For example, as in ZFC set theory, we may want to have some existence axioms. They guarantee us that in this formal system certain objects do exist. An example is the axiom of the empty set: There exists a set which has no elements. This statement can be written in our formal language.<p>Other axioms may have a more constructive meaning. Instead of telling us that something exists, they say that given the existence of some objects we know the existence of further objects. An example would be the axiom of set unions: Given some arbitrary sets A and B, there exists a set C, which contains all the members of A and all the members of B as its elements. Another axiom asserts the existence of an unordered pair of any two given sets, from this we can define the concept of an ordered pair, which is very important.<p>ZFC is one example of a set theory, there are many different set theories. You could exchange classical logic with intuitionistic logic and arrive at some formal system for intuitionistic or constructive set theory. You can drop certain axioms, because maybe they do not appear as self-evident to you (for example the axiom of choice, which contributes the &quot;C&quot; in ZFC, is not accepted by some people). You may add further axioms to arrive at a possibly stronger theory.<p>One interesting aspect about set theory is that the concept of set is very powerful and expressive, because many concepts from modern mathematics can be build up from sets: natural numbers 0,1,2,3,... can be constructed from the empty set, functions can be represented through ordered pairs of sets. Sometimes set theory is regarded as &quot;the foundation of all mathematics&quot;, but feel free to disagree! Just because natural numbers can be modelled as sets it is not certain that natural numbers are indeed sets.<p>The basic pattern above is the formalization of an intuitive or natural concept, something from everyday life. We try to capture the essentials of this concept within a formal system. And then we can use the deductive power of the formal system to arrive at new and hopefully interesting conclusions about whatever we wanted to formalize. These conclusions are theorems. Not all theorems are interesting, some are even confusing, paradox and disppointing. Formalization is used to arrive at new insights about the original concept. Interesting in this context is Carnap and his idea of explication of inexact prescientific concepts:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explication</a><p>What I want to express with this is that it is really possible to start your journey into mathematics at a beginning.",1417687018

8698559,comment,8697028,8698281,0,0,cakoose,,,"Fossil&#x27;s bug tracker is not just a separate system bundled with Fossil.  The bug database is integrated with the VCS for a reason.  Edits to the bug database are tracked, branched, and merged the same way source code is.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you create a branch to work on a new bug fix.  In that branch, you make the fix to the source code, and modify the bug status to &quot;fixed&quot;.  When you merge your branch back into trunk, both the code fix and bug status get merged atomically.<p>It definitely is possible to create a bug tracker that did these things but was still separate from the VCS.  I remember seeing some early-stage bug trackers that stored all bug data as files in the repository (instead of in a separate database) and could be made to work with multiple VCS backends easily.  However, since VCSes weren&#x27;t designed for this, it was sort of of clunky to use.<p>Ideally, there would be some interface between VCS and bug tracker to make sure they&#x27;re decoupled but still work well together, but nobody has figured out that interface yet.  Until someone does, it&#x27;s much simpler for Fossil to ignore the coupling issue for now and focus instead on making the best product they can.",1417686903

It&#x27;s no longer new to them, it&#x27;s no longer in a price frenzy, the hype is gone.<p>No: that the hype is gone doesn&#x27;t mean that Bitcoin is no longer &#x27;hot&#x27;. There are still massive developments and there&#x27;s still massive interest in Bitcoin, but it has just assumed some more realistic proportions. There are TONS of huge things going on behind the scenes that the general public is not interested in, but that are really really promising for the future of Bitcoin. The amount of VC money flowing into Bitcoin is enormous, more and more shops keep accepting Bitcoin (in 2014 we&#x27;ve seen companies like Dell, Overstock, TigerDirect, PayPal, Braintree, Newegg and many others starting to accept Bitcoin) and behind the scenes there are loads of developments.<p>I think that Bitcoin WILL be huge, but that the general public will never care about it and will almost never use it directly. I see Bitcoin as just a network, or a protocol. Tons of payment services will be built on top of Bitcoin, offering superior service to the customer, but abstracting any interaction with Bitcoin away for the end user. For example: this week came out that the 3 biggest banks in the Netherlands (ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank) have been investigating Bitcoin for a year now and are looking to make all their transactions work through the blockchain. The user wouldn&#x27;t notice anything different, but the bank would be able to provide its services much faster and much cheaper.",1417686848

8698549,comment,8697772,8698305,0,0,nicklaf,,,"You&#x27;re certainly welcome!<p>I should probably mention one thing.  In your post, you mentioned electronics, which does not so much require an understanding of mathematics, but rather a competence in solving differential equations in physics.  If you are only interested in topics that are under the umbrella of electrical engineering, then you do not need to study mathematics at all.  Rather, you should be studying physics, which, except at the highest theoretical levels, is more or less the practice of solving differential equations (without the kind of abstract proofs that would satisfy a mathematician).  Pure mathematics is only about proofs, but with the assurance that this understanding will allow you to apply whatever problem solving techniques you may have to new domains (including situations where it is far from obvious that they apply--this is the value of mathematics).<p>In short, I would say that computer science is a good segue from pure mathematics, but if your goals is electronics, the kind of thinking you will need comes from learning physics--no more, no less.  On the other hand, to truly understand cryptography, a background in pure mathematics is required (specifically, you should understand number theory and abstract algebra).<p>One thing to keep in mind: do not be mislead by similar notation between mathematics and physics: they are very, very different subjects.  Certainly, physics uses equations; in addition, many theoretical results in mathematics explain (at a very high level) why certain problem solving techniques work in physics.  However (at least until you reach research level physics), the overlap ends there, with the exception of linear algebra.<p>In fact, if there was one subject I could recommend to you (besides basic calculus) which is pretty much universally used, from optimization, to physics (all branches), to machine learning and statistics, it would be linear algebra, no contest.  (I should admit here that I&#x27;ve contradicted my early remark in the first paragraph that one needn&#x27;t study mathematics at all to understand physics, since linear algebra and calculus are indeed mathematics.  However, while learning these two subjects rigorously in the spirit of mathematics will certainly aid you conceptually when you attempt to apply them to physics, it is also true that in physics you do not need to know how to prove the results in order to use them.)",1417686678

Fossil asserts a highly ethical position, that revising historical facts is not an acceptable practice.<p>There is big drawback in making it very hard to edit &quot;history&quot;: you are bound to carry in your project all sorts of things that you do not want to. And this becomes an even worse problem when you combine source code, tickets and a wiki as Fossil does.<p>Somebody posts spam as tickets? Now you are bound to have traces of that spam forever in your published repository.<p>I switched away from bzr to git, just like many others, also because bzr made it impossible to fix small stupid mistakes. OK, I pressed Enter while reaching out for the shift key and made a commit with the wrong commit message. Why do I have to keep that? What does the project gains from this?<p>I think the problem here is with the word &quot;history&quot;. We attach a lot of meaning to that word and nobody wants to be a &quot;history rewriter&quot; or a &quot;revisionist&quot;. I prefer more neutral terms like &quot;patch queue&quot; or &quot;version chains&quot;. &quot;I polished the chain&quot; sounds much better than &quot;I rewrote history&quot;.",1417685662

8698511,comment,8697772,8698348,0,0,nicklaf,,,"I would be very careful before unleashing a beginner on this book.  It would be too easy, IMO, for the reader to end up with the wrong idea that mechanical proofs like the ones in this book are all that are needed in mathematics, since it&#x27;s possible to get as far as the real numbers (or complex numbers) with so little geometric intuition.  Furthermore, the real numbers are the most concrete, familiar setting to do analysis in, but it is not healthy to spend so much focus on the concrete details of the real line so early on: a student of mathematics needs variation to keep alive her or his curiosity.  Pugh does an excellent job of explaining the simple geometric essence of Dedekind cuts.  In principle, one might learn something about proof writing by reading the Landau book.  However, it is much, much better, IMO, to defer detailed study of something so specific, until after first surveying the setting in which the results of Landau&#x27;s book are used.  In most real analysis books, the reader is asked to prove a few of the results covered in Landau.<p>Mathematics is foremost a conceptual subject rather than a mechanical one, and it is immaterial that the reader have firsthand experience that all the theorems are proven.  As one learns mathematics, it soon becomes apparent that there will always be gaps in her or his knowledge, and that is therefore best to skip steps that s/he believes could be done in principle.",1417685552

In Common Lisp (the dialect being used here), macros can break in rare, subtle ways. The obvious happens when you don&#x27;t use GENSYM:<p><pre><code>    (defmacro foo (var)\n      `(let* ((x 3))\n         (setf ,var x)))\n    \n    CL-USER> (let ((x 7))\n               (foo x)\n               x)\n    7\n    \n    CL-USER> (let ((y 7))\n               (foo y)\n               y)\n    3\n</code></pre>\nbut is fairly easy to avoid. In practice, as long as you make judicious use of GENSYM and packages, the only thing you <i>really</i> need to worry about is someone FLETing a symbol in the package COMMON-LISP (or <i>maybe</i> an external symbol in your package):<p><pre><code>    (defmacro bar (x y z)\n      `(list ,x ,y ,z))\n    \n    CL-USER> (let ((list &#x27;(7)))\n               (bar 1 2 3))\n    (1 2 3)\n    \n    CL-USER> (flet ((list (a b c)\n                      (+ a b c)))\n               (bar 1 2 3))\n    6\n</code></pre>\nSBCL actually yelled at me when I tried this for violating the package lock on COMMON-LISP.

So, in all likelihood, you will start to branch out even before you manage to finish your first serious math book.  (Taking this to the extreme, Paul Halmos once pointed out that a good way to learn a great deal of mathematics is to read the first chapter of many different books.)<p>It&#x27;s certainly not the case that Spivak and Pugh are the only books out there which help you develop the &quot;mathematical maturity&quot; that will allow you to apply mathematics creatively in other areas.  For a mathematics major in college, real analysis probably is the optimum choice of subject.  (Not every mathematician directly needs real analysis, but almost all would undoubtedly say that the subject shaped his or her thinking, even if only to provide a setting to learn about writing rigorous proofs.)<p>That said, for someone who doesn&#x27;t intend study a great deal of &#x27;traditional&#x27;, mathematics, but perhaps wants to learn about computer science and applications of mathematics to engineering problems, there certainly are more direct ways to spend the time it would take to read all of Spivak or Pugh.  While learning real analysis is a great foundation for subjects that involve calculus or topology (for example, convex geometry, which has applications in optimization), there are other options too.  Two subjects which are also good at introducing mathematical thinking, while at the same time being essential in many computer applications, are linear algebra and number theory.  One specific number theory text doesn&#x27;t come to mind.  Linear algebra texts vary in emphasis.  I can vouch for &quot;Linear Algebra Done Right&quot; by Axler, but there are many others which more heavily emphasize the applications (and there are many, many applications of linear algebra).<p>I am sure that there are websites (or courses, or maybe even published books) designed to introduce proof-writing in these subjects, but also also including material on using computer algebra packages (such as SAGE) to compute certain results as well.<p>Finally, the subject known as &quot;discrete mathematics&quot;, as well as computer science material on the analysis of algorithms also have a great deal of connections with pure mathematics (and especially real and complex analysis, as well as basic calculus).  &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot; by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik comes immediately to mind.  In fact, one might say that &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot; is to students of mathematics who favor discrete problems (i.e., computer science) as Spivak is to students of mathematics who favor continuous problems (i.e., traditional mathematics).",1417684653

Do those all not do quite what you need?<p>Certainly, there are many functions that do what I need - but in my experience, the &quot;higher&quot; the level of the function is, the smaller the chances that it fullfills my needs.<p>> Conversely, does other software do better, on average, in &#x27;doing what one wants&#x27;? Which software?<p>Over the years I have come to appreciate Matlab. Like Mathematica, it also has some maddening idiosyncrasies [0] and is mostly closed source, but it let&#x27;s me inspect its high level functions. For instance, if I am not happy about the errorbar plots, I can execute the command &quot;edit errorbar&quot; to get an idea what I have to change. If the change is complex, Matlab is a decent enough IDE to implement it anyways. In comparison, Mathematica seems like a front-end to the kernel to me. It is not a proper IDE. I heard there is a Mathematica IDE called Wolfram Workbench [1], but it costs extra.<p>For me, my biggest problem is not about the sofware &quot;doing what one wants&quot;, but that it is doing things I don&#x27;t want. File corruption and sign error bugs are absolutely not ok for software that I base my publications on, and I have not encountered them in the alternatives [2].<p>Mathematica is a powerful piece of software and has many use cases. Of course it can&#x27;t be a &quot;eierlegende Wollmilchsau&quot; that is good at everything [3]. But personally (disgruntled customer rambling here) I wonder why Wolfram Research is devoting so much energy into developing all these new, shiny features while the foundation is crumbling.<p>[0] Try running a Matlab script that has - gasp - a space in its name. It will fail and produce an &quot;undefined function&quot; error message. (Not very helpful to new users.) The newer versions at least warn you if you try to <i>save</i> a script with an illegal name - but they still allow you to <i>run</i> it and produce the non-descript error message.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wolfram.com/products/workbench/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolfram.com/products/workbench/</a><p>[2] The alternatives I actually use are Igor Pro, Matlab, and Excel. Excel can easily lead to sign errors because of the unexpected behaviour of the unary minus. It takes precedence over the power operator, so if you evaluate &quot;-1^2&quot;, the result is +1. While you can get used to that behaviour, you can easily forget it when you work with references. Say A1 contains 1, then &quot;-A1^2&quot; evaluates to +1. If, like me, you prefer working with named cells and name A1 as x, then &quot;-x^2&quot; also evaluates to +1. I once botched an analysis due to this behaviour. Ironically, this was one of the reasons why I wanted to base my current analysis on Mathematica.<p>[3] <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wollmilchsau.png?uselang=de"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wollmilchsau.png?usel...</a>",1417683967

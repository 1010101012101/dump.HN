1714443,comment,1707013,1707408,0,0,mhartl,,,"I agree with you that the parent comment detracts from the discussion and deserves its downvotes. Nevertheless, Thomas Jefferson's hypocrisy, as exemplified by the Declaration of Independence, was obvious even to some of his contemporaries. For instance, in his <i>Strictures upon the Declaration of Independence</i> [1], former Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor Thomas Hutchinson wrote the following:<p>--<p>I should therefore be impertinent, if I attempted to shew... in what sense all men are created equal; or how far life, liberty, and the <i>pursuit of happiness</i> may be said to be unalienable; only I could wish to ask the Delegates of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas, how their Constituents justify the depriving more than an hundred thousand Africans of their rights to liberty, and the <i>pursuit of happiness</i>, and in some degree to their lives, if these rights are so absolutely unalienable...<p>--<p>Evidently, Jefferson doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt simply because lots of people back then had slaves. His positive reputation today rests on a much simpler and sturdier foundation than his intellectual accomplishments or (dubious) moral fiber, namely, <i>military victory</i>. We mustn't forget the lesson contained in the aphorism ""The winners write the history books"", which is that <i>the winners write the history books</i>. Jefferson (and the Patriots) won; Hutchinson (and the Loyalists) didn't.<p>[1] Thomas Hutchinson, <i>Strictures upon the Declaration of Independence</i>, 1776. <a href=""http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1130&Itemid=264"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&...</a>",1285109995

1) get funding and launch masively

1714409,comment,1714184,1714184,0,0,alsomike,,,"I agree with this, but for different reasons. The difference between ""Edit my profile"" and ""Edit your profile"" is really a difference in how the relationship between user, interface and back-end system is conceived. When the interface says ""Edit my profile"", it's represented as speaking for the user to the system, so you have [user+interface] <---> [system]. Which is a technically accurate representation of client-server architecture, and also generally the way the world looks from the perspective of any system - the UI is decoupled, and speaks to the system on my behalf, in my voice. This is the system-centered perspective.<p>To the average user, the world looks quite different: [user] <---> [interface+system]. Here, the interface isn't part of ""me"", it's outside, part of the system, so it should speak as the system, not as ""me"". This is the user-centered perspective, because it reflects how users see the world.<p>I think this also speaks to why programmers generally tend to be bad at user experience - it's almost an ontological problem. What is software, really? Is it just system, with interface added in later, almost as an afterthought? Or is it interface+system?",1285109339

I didn't get the point of static typing until I learned OCaml - the static typing in C, C++, Java, etc. is a joke. (Especially C!) Type inference also singlehandedly removes one of the biggest problems with common static typing - structuring code so that types reflect assumptions (and changing them with the code) is no longer incredibly verbose.<p>I think the most pragmatic approach is probably dynamic typing with support for static annotations and as much inference as is feasible, though. (As with Common Lisp or Erlang's dialyzer.) Static and dynamic typing is more of a continuum than an absolute fork.<p>Also, minor point - you mean ""static"" typing, not ""strong"" typing.

But speaking personally as someone who does mostly Ruby but is building increasingly complex infrastructure in Ruby and trying to break things up sanely -- it helps me to think clearly when I prototype the interfaces and the types in a statically typed language like Scala.<p>Surely it's meant to be the other way around? But an interesting realisation for me.<p>On the other hand, there's that feeling of code which does exactly what it needs to do to pass the tests, nothing more, nothing less. Which while very economical and very suited to rapid development, often doesn't stand up in its own right as a respectable design without regular and very disciplined ""and now I go back and refactor"" steps. Often those steps correspond (to my way of thinking) with going back and thinking deeper about the types and the interfaces.<p>So, I think types are more than just a limited kind of testing which happens to run statically - they also give you a conceptual framework and <i>structure</i>, in the mathematical as well as the regular sense of the word. An ontology, if that's not too grand a word for it. And as such they can help shape your design and spur you into phrasing your design clearly.

Can you imagine a similar piece writing about the woes of Terminal Cancer or Business Failure or Having An Autistic Child?<p>Everyone's got problems, but people who are actually suffering don't write this way.  Nobody defines themselves by their problems; ask a poor person if he's poor, and he'll probably say, ""Oh no, I'm not <i>that</i> poor, I have an X.""  Or maybe, ""Oh, I'm poor all right, but I'm not unhappy.""  Or perhaps even, ""Yeah, I'm poor, and it <i>is</i> kind of miserable, but X makes it okay.""<p>What you won't get is, ""Oh, I'm so poor and miserable, and you have no idea what poverty is like, let me list the ways I suffer, and let me drive home how very impossible it is for you, from your life of privelege, to ever comprehend how much I suffer every minute.""<p>Well, unless you ask an angsty teenager. ;)<p>Just about everybody has problems, but nobody defines themselves by their troubles.  Everyone thinks of himself as a complex person, with some miseries and some joys, some problems and some opportunities, some strengths and some weaknesses.<p>Think over your own life; you could almost certainly write a piece like this about some problem you've had.  Something has been miserable and unjust for you, in a way people who haven't been there would have a hard time identifying with.<p>But do you define yourself by it?  Neither do The Poor.<p>That gets at the heart of what I find troubling about this piece.<p>This is not about a particular person's or a particular community's experience of poverty.  This is about The Poor, as a monolithic, mythical entity.  And anytime you see someone cast a community of people, who are inherently diverse and complex by virtue of <i>being people</i>, as a simple, mythical stereotype, you're seeing intellectual dishonesty in action.  Leftists are socialists, Christians are stupid or evil, Hacker News readers are well off, Iraqis approve the occupation, Americans are arrogant.  These things can only be said from a distance; those who have spent time with these communities up close and personal would be hard pressed to say anything was true of all of them.  People are diverse.<p>Let me call these sentiments what they are: bigotry.  They divide the population into ""us"" and ""them"", and say we are this way, and they are that way.<p>(That's not to say you can't make useful generalizations.  You can.  But an honest generalization acknowledges that it is a simplification of a complex reality, and welcomes statistics and counterexamples that heighten the clarity of the image.  Bigotry says reality is simple, and don't argue with me, dammit.)<p>Step back a moment and you know that poverty is complex, and poverty is relative.  There are transient homeless and chronic homeless.  There are ambitious immigrants without a dollar to their names, there are musicians living the bohemian life, there are barely-profitable-but-proud startup founders living on ramen, there are third generation prostitutes who will never know their fathers, there are children sold into sexual slavery before they're even teens, there are women trapped in polygamous, fundamentalist Mormon communities, there are parents who helplessly watch their children starve to death.  So what ""is poverty""?  By what authority does this author say, ""Poverty is...""?<p>This is not a rational attempt to characterize poverty.  This is not a reference to studies which say ""67% of households in XX neighborhood in 2008 had to go without a meal at least once a week for lack of funds.""  This is a series of emotional statements.  This says, ""Poverty is having to hunt squirrels in the park for food and being so hungry that you'll even eat the nasty bits.""<p>And if someone comes back and says, ""Actually, poverty isn't that bad,"" is their diverse viewpoint into a complex problem welcomed?  No, the response is, ""Clearly you've never experienced <i>true</i> poverty, you insensitive bastard.""<p>What's going on here?<p>Emotional, self-serving bigotry.  These are not poor people talking about contemporary problems, looking for practical solutions.  These are people who know what Poverty Is one-upping those who Don't Know What Poverty Is with their superior Social Awareness.  It's a race to see who can be the most heartbroken by this emotional Reality of Poverty, criticizing nothing, adding to the tales of woe, acknowledging that yes, by God, it's true, it's all true.<p>I have no doubt that the anecdotes are true, that they have roots in real experience.  People really do suffer despair, hunger, and degrading treatment.  But an emotional characterization without any roots in reason, a construction of a mythology of The Poor as objects of pity?  I think that's actually destructive.<p>Impersonal pity is degrading and infuriating.  You see it in some of the experiences recounted in the original post and comments.  People would anonymously leave us food or presents, one commenter says, and even though we needed them it provoked us to white-hot rage.  We were not <i>that</i> poor.<p>Kindness and compassion are encouraging and uplifting, whether you are going out to lunch with a poor friend or complimenting a rich friend on his poetry.  It doesn't matter how miserable or happy a person is; he can be made happier by love, by personal kindness.  But depersonalized pity is always degrading.  If you do not think of yourself as The Poor, how insulting is it that your neighbor does, that he thinks your life is so unbearable that you would rather have a few crumbs from his table than keep your sense of dignity?<p>There is a subtle art to being kind.  It's all about treating people with dignity, respecting their personhood.<p>Kindness is your friend, the rich professor, treating you to an extravagent dinner at the best club in town as a thank you for your hard work helping him grade papers.  Pity is an anonymous millionaire giving you $200 for the same dinner just so you can ""feel like a human being for a night.""  Kindness is your neighbor, the fit, poor, stay at home mom, offering to help her elderly and disabled neighbor with some chores after chatting over lunch.  Pity is $50 in an envelope taped to your door with a note that says, ""I can see your living room from the street and feel sorry for you; this is to hire a housekeeper for a day.""<p>The original post provokes pity, and I find that degrading.  Here, for comparison, is what compassion sounds like:<p><a href=""http://jmchoul.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!F04579021E6249A3!1431.entry#comment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmchoul.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!F04579021E6249A3!143...</a>

1714308,comment,1712493,1712493,0,0,elblanco,,,"My grandmother grew up during the great depression. She still hoards food in nooks and crannies throughout the house and when let loose on a piece of chicken will eat every last scrap of digestible item on the bone. She habitually makes soup with boiled beef bones to get every last ounce of nutrition.<p>My father grew up just post-depression in a very rural area. While he never missed a meal, many meals consisted of only a few slices of bread as a filler and maybe some soup and not much else. I've never seen him eat a meal without eating some bread with it, he said it makes him feel uncomfortable.<p>My family was pretty low-end middle class growing up, and a couple of unlucky business decisions set us homeless for the better part of a year, with my entire family of 4 living in a single room subsidized motel room (rent 5 days, get the weekends for free) followed by two years of living out of two rented rooms in somebody's basement. We also never missed a meal, but I can tell you that I, to this day, cannot eat a cup of noodles meal without thinking about drug addicts banging at our motel room door thinking we were the room down the hall. We did better after that, and then later in life, as an adult, I found myself in not-quite-so-bad-but-not-great circumstances. A time when I used to decide if I could buy lunch at McDonald's or Taco Bell by counting how many hours extra I would have to work to pay for McDonald's.<p>Some of the things Scalzi mentions, would have been luxuries at certain moments in my life...like <i>having</i> toys. I've spent time as a child with no toys at all.<p>People who have never been poor, have absolutely no understanding, cannot fathom, why people are poor and why they stay poor. Being poor is not about having a lack of money, it's about having a lack of wealth. It's a way of life. A person who has never been poor cannot understand why you can't ""just go to night school"" to improve your lot in life because they don't understand that between two 40 hour a week jobs, and 2 or 3 hours a day of walking between jobs, home, the day-old-baked goods store and the salvation army, you have maybe 4 or 5 hours that night for sleep...every night. And what intense sleep deprivation coupled with intense, dangerous and stressful jobs can do to a person after decades. We worry about soldiers deployed for 18 months, imagine that type of life for 18 years solid.<p>""Being poor is picking the 10 cent ramen instead of the 12 cent ramen because that’s two extra packages for every dollar."" This is the type of calculation one has to make all day every day when one is poor. It's very easy to be critical when you see a poor person buy a pack of cigs or a 6-pack of beer instead of a head of lettuce or that month's electricity bill. But I dare anybody to live that kind of life and not be so stressed and so damaged from the constancy of it, that you seek any kind of escape possible and that desire for escape infects all of your decisions. When your eating decisions are down to decisions about pennies, there's really not much worse things can get. Having the lights turned off because you didn't pay the bill does not really make things all that much worse in your day to day.<p>""Being poor is four years of night classes for an Associates of Art degree."" The prime question asked by those who have never been poor, and are unable to empathize with those who are, is this...""why don't you just go to school and make your lot in life better?"" There are lots of reasons to be poor in the first place. If you are <i>lucky</i> like I was, it's not because you have a mental disease or a severe learning disability, or are crippled or in some other way handicapped or not raised in a generational environment of poverty where you honestly don't understand that going to class can translate into a house in the suburbs because you have absolutely no life experience for you to understand that. Just in the same way some people don't understand what it's like to be poor, poor people can't understand what life is like to be not poor.<p>I <i>was</i> able to spend the 6 years in night school to get my 2 year A.S., which brought me up a step in life so that I could spend another 3 years getting the last two years of my B.S. which brought up a step in life so I could spend another 4 years getting my M.S. But at each step, if I hadn't had a person at that time to help me up that step, and give me an opportunity, I'd still be comparing Ramen prices, or figuring out how many meals a 10-pack of tacos from Taco Bell would last. And if I hadn't had the emotional support from good friends, or people who believed in me...well, 10 years is a terribly long time to keep motivated to change your lot in life while also doing all the other things people do in their day-to-day, like keeping down full-time jobs, career advancement, marriage, etc. Basically, being poor <i>is</i> a full-time job on top of your other full-time jobs. But I don't think that every poor peer I knew while I was poor could do the same. I got lucky and had great opportunity, and I worked hard to seize those opportunities when they came along. If nobody ever opens the door for you, you can't ever go through it and <i>nobody</i> is strong enough to carve their path in life to success all on their own.<p>My friend, who was born with the after-effects of an alcoholic and drug addicted mother, was unable to keep passing grades in his 6 year quest for a 2 year associate's degree and has never held a salaried position. That means he's never had health insurance, which means he's lost 3 jobs because he spent 14 hours in an ER getting basic medical care. It means he's had cars repossessed because somebody hit him and he had no auto-insurance and couldn't pay the repair bill out of pocket. It means that sometimes, to escape the shitty life he has to live every day, he sometimes buys a used book to escape into instead of a head of lettuce. It also means that sometimes, at the beginning of the month, he's just paid his rent, and he has $12 left in his bank account to stretch out till his next paycheck.<p>And then, after you've been poor for a long time, it shows. There's an aura about a poor person that no amount of hair product and tailored suits can shake. It sits on them in how they walk, how they talk, how they sit, how their skin hangs, what their build looks like, how the hold themselves, where they look in a room, how they behave at a meal. Because of this, no matter how hard they've worked to ""make it"", they'll always have that stigma attached to them, even by people that never knew they were poor. They'll present like a poor person so they'll interview worse, they'll get promoted less frequently, they'll get scored lower on yearly reviews.<p>Going from poor to not poor, is not about climbing a ladder. It's about being on the front of a seige engine attacking a fortress while arrows and bullets and hot oil rains down on you.",1285107375

I sucked at design for years (though I thought I was good), and now I think I'm better (though I may not actually be very good). Find someone honest about your designs and ask him. It's hard to be objective about your own designs, even if you want to be.<p>Visit CSS galleries. Emulate specific elements. Combine them. Create your first site (when I started I pretended I was hired to do the marketing page for Dropbox). Then another. One day you'll be good.<p>Just keep at it. Good luck!

is that everyone relies very heavily on the tests. So, there is no
necessity to check the tests, you start from a position of knowing that
the tests are complete.<p>The NASA issue could equally have been caught by better testing. It's
hard to debate that point, because we don't know the strength of the
testing in that case. Other than it was clearly not adequate.<p>Regarding your last point: I find that having excellent unit tests and
coverage means that I can concentrate singularly on the design problem
at hand and experiment very broadly without any fear of regression.
That's an enormously liberating place to be.",1285106472

45903,comment,45647,45647,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"This reminds me of when Shawn Fanning of Napster visited my university in 2000. He came along with some corporate guys that seemed like his body guards and filters for anything he said. The discussion revolved around the whole Napster debate of course and the main business guy said they wanted to start charging a couple of dollars per song to make it legal. When time came for questions, I asked why they didn't just move their operations to a country where they would be within the legal limits to continue Napster as it was. His answer was basically ""we just don't want to"", which wasn't very satisfying. Now after allofmp3.com made their millions, I wonder if they regret not doing something like that. Of course, I'm sure there were compelling factors that would prevent well-known american businessmen from circumventing the system in that manner. Looks like Mendel doesn't suffer from the same limitations.",1187909244

All of Google's AJAX apps start blowing up the VSZ/RSS of the process when I leave them open for even a medium amount of time (i.e. longer than 15 minutes). This is using Firefox on Mac OS X. Most of the Google AJAX apps are not supported in Safari as yet, so I can't really compare and contrast ;-) I can't say that FF is great on RAM to begin with, however, but this could be b/c I always have at least 3 tabs going, sometimes up to 30.",1187908694

It's a bit pricey compared to FREE, but now that they have a hosted version, it's great if you need to track bugs with a team.<p>The simplicity and approach of FogBugz is fantastic. Really worth a look if you have the cash to afford it. That being said - they do have provide it for free if you only need 2 accounts.

45897,comment,45815,45874,0,0,brett,,,"Yeah. I've been thinking about how to best add more than one chain since I started. My main concern is making sure that at any time you can single click on a day with an unambiguous result (viz. it toggles color). So far I'm thinking some sort of tabbish view where you only see one chain at a time. <p>Adding non daily chains is something to think about. ",1187908597

45894,story,,,2,3,gibsonf1,"FireFox Bug running Google Docs?",,"I've noticed a disturbing pattern when running Google Docs on FireFox.  I typically run 2 separate gdoc gmail account tabs and 2 separate calendar tabs as well as other tabs for my web app etc.  What consistently happens is that FF uses increasing amounts of memory.  By the time it hits 1gig of memory used, the response time is amazingly slow.<p>As an experiment, I tried running just the gmail and calendar on IE, and was shocked not to find a similar problem.  Is there some kind of javascript bug running on Firefox?  Or could this be related to Firebug and Yslow running on the browser at the same time?  Anyone have a similar problem?",1187908368

45890,comment,45698,45698,0,0,catena,,,"In 1985, Peter Naur wrote a similar article presenting programming as theory building.  In essence, a programmer primarily constructs a mental model of the problem, and its
solution; secondarily writes code; and incidentally documents.

45885,comment,45619,45867,0,0,rms,,,"I'm coasting along now with a 2.8 GPA and a willingness to let it slip to a 2.0. I'm an industrial engineering student and you may remember us as the efficiency experts from movies such as Office Space and American Beauty. The salary for an Industrial Engineer in Pittsburgh is almost constant for anyone with a QPA over 2.0. Those with better grades just get to work for a more nationally known firm instead of a local manufacturer.<p>College is so aversive to me because all it does is prepare me to work for someone else, at a guaranteed salary of 55k per year (sixty by the time I graduate?). True failure for me will be taking a job as an Industrial Engineer. I can't think of anything I want to do less. But if I haven't become successful by the time I graduate from college and no one is funding me, I won't have much of a choice.<p>I'm running my current startup like a business. We're not seeking funding and we're growing very slowly. We have no costs so everything we make is profit. We haven't made any profit because we haven't actually sold anything but we'll get there eventually.",1187906717

Among 332 pairs of siblings in which one was breast-fed and the other bottle-fed, researchers also found no difference in IQ.""<p>At the same time, breastfeeding is insanely expensive. It is insanely difficult for a working woman to breastfeed, and breastfeeding makes it extremely difficult to share the child-rearing burden between the mom and the dad.<p>Like with most recommendations having to do with child-rearing, those involving breastfeeding are both unscientific and aren't subject to cost-benefit analysis. Given the extremely tenuous proven benefits of breastfeeding, a baby is almost certainly better off in the long run from the mom's increased earning power from not having to downshift her career to breastfeed.",1367081977

5618296,comment,5616875,5616994,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Excellent question and some great answers here. Most of the ARM designs are similarly in SOC's that are targeted to a fairly integrated space (like a phone or tablet) so getting the server peripherals on them is painful. A good example of that is the RasPi which does everything through USB basically and attaching storage via USB isn't really great.<p>That said, there is growing interest in dis-aggregation (think of it like component servers) and there are some interesting changes that brings into the space. Reasonably soon we could see an ARM SOC with a couple of nice network ports on it, and a ""rack"" where part of the rack was a shared storage pool for the rack and the rest was a swarm of compute. In applications where there is a high data to compute ratio (think digging though multi-petabyte date sets for stuff) The channel bandwidth benefit of many replicated compute nodes gives it an advantage over the larger 'server' type nodes. Fun times to design distributed architectures.",1367081957

5618293,comment,5617642,5617642,6,0,RivieraKid,,,"Opinions on some of the movies from the list I've seen:<p><i>Idiocracy</i>  Basically an ordinary comedy, with an above average plot, but overall nothing <i>that</i> special or interesting. Overrated.<p><i>Fight Club</i>  One of my favourite movies, perhaps in my top 10. Really loved it.<p><i>The Game</i>  Another great movie from David Fincher, I love the mysterious atmosphere of his movies.<p><i>The Man From Earth.</i>  Huge disappointment, I never understood why people like this movie. It's basically one guy telling a predictable and boring story. One of the most overrated movies ever. (I mean overrated in subjective sense obviously.)<p><i>Traffic</i>  One of the best movies about drugs and organized crime.<p><i>Inception</i>  Above average but overrated, logically inconsistent, nothing really special about this movie. <i>The Cell</i> is another movie where people enter someone else's dreams and even though it has only 6.2 on IMDB, I think I enjoyed it more. The depictions of the dreams were definitely more creative and looked more dreamy.<p>Of the top of my head I would recommend these:<p>* Something from David Lynch  Lost Highway, Blue Velvet or Mullholland Drive.<p>* Requiem for Dream<p>* Evil (2003)<p>* Sin City<p>* Crank  not very known, but wow, this is the best action movie ever.<p>* Elite squad  another great action movie, very realistic, borderline documentary.",1367081914

I do my best to keep my workflow straightforward, eliminate distractions, and stay focused on my tasks, and I get quite a bit done each day but the more I can do, the better, right?<p>I'm wondering if any more seasoned developers have good advice for me, as far as improving my workflow, and coding more efficiently? I use Vim, and am trying to improve my muscle memory for operating on code. Any vim user tips? At what intervals should I take breaks from coding? Should I stay away from developing on the weekends to let my mind rest? Should I keep working on weekends to keep my brain active? At times I have to switch projects and work on something completely different, sometimes even in a different language, and that seems to throw my mind of for a few minutes. Is there anything I can do to make the process of switching projects easier? Is it normal to be thrown off by an abrupt project-switch? Sometimes I have to do 2 or 3 projects concurrently, and I end up having 2 or 3 bash windows open with different projects in each one. Should I try to just work on one thing at a time?<p>Thanks for any advice, I'm just trying to improve my developing habits and consolidate my workflow into something that's as efficient as possible.

There is no justification for proceeding with it.<p>However, if ""standstill"" equates only to user-facing features, chances are the re-write is to address critical issues elsewhere (I get the impression that was the situation with the OP.)

Also, listen to your favorite, upbeat music.<p>Benefits:<p>* exercise is generally good for the frontal cortex, what helps you focus and get things done [1]<p>* exercising in the morning will put you in a more positive mood, helping to reduce stress; by reducing stress, you feel more energetic, you feel less hungry and crave less crappy food, therefore you prevent the systematic downward spiral that comes with it and you lose weight.<p>* because you exercise in the morning, you burn more fat [2]<p>* adding music is great for your dopamine levels: [3]<p>* intensity (anaerobic exercise) is more important than duration and frequency [4]<p>I ran into this routine because I always have a hard time waking up in the morning (not so much anymore) and was always late to work. But knowing from previous experience that working out intensely in the morning helped with my energy level and focus, I did 10-15 minutes and found that it's all that I needed.

The point is to address those problems that are involving too many people (and/or people whose contact would otherwise not be under hand), which for this reason could not yet be just worked out by people on their own. And do it by systematically putting together the needed information which will finally make it possible for people to apply their own free judgment and action, possibly through delegates when needed, for solving the problems.<p>""And then it completely ignores the state's monopoly on violent retribution""\nWhat do you mean by ""ignore"" ? I focus on a large category of problems and how they can be resolved independently of the presence or absence of any violent retribution system; and that this is a so important quantity of things that the effects of these ""soft"" solutions will finally turn out to be heavier than the ordinary use of force by democratic states (well the case of non-democratic countries will be harder but...), and will ultimately absorb that use of force in it.<p>Some discussions implicitly assume the old list of political theories as the only available alternatives, thus are made obsolete by this proposition of another solution.\nI don't feel concerned with the question ""state monopoly of force or not"" since my proposition develops on another level that makes the question of force somewhat irrelevant.\nNamely, it would first focus on handling a large range of problems that I would qualify as indeed political but without disputing or requiring interaction with the current state power, as these are political problems of a kind that does not enter the category of problems that the state ever tried to manage: too small and not formal enough problems to ever reach any bureaucrat's desk, but of still quite real and heavy importance once summed up, relativizing as anecdotal the question of what to do with state force. Need examples ?<p>To talk about ""enforcement mechanism"" : I offer one that can be effective without need of force.

If the process effectively limits the developments that can go up in a year, only the highest margin projects will go up. That's also the back-log issue. A brand new building can charge higher rents than an older one. If you kept people from building new high-rises in the 1970's, then there isn't a supply of 30-40 year old buildings that offer lower rents. Moreover, if you prevent old buildings from being torn down, that raises the price of plots zoned for high rise construction. So only high margin projects will go up.<p>Yes, Manhatten is a popular island and will be naturally expensive. But its a lot more expensive than it would be if developers were allowed to flood the market with supply. Think about all the low-rise housing all over the city. Those buildings themselves are worth nothing--they're old tenement housing for the most part. If I owned one of those 20 unit buildings in say the east village, the vast majority of the value of my property is in the land. Given the prevailing high rents, why wouldn't I tear down that building and put up a 300 unit high-rise instead? That's what happens in a market. Markets hate profits.

5618158,comment,5615749,5616213,4,0,SimHacker,,,"Typically, pie menus support both ""click up, point, click down"" browsing and ""press down, drag, release"" gestures.<p>Pie menus can support ""click up"" tracking compatibly with ""press/drag/release"" tracking, even allowing users to switch between both modes when browsing submenus.<p>This is important for supporting both novice and expert users, learnability, rehearsal and muscle memory.<p>You can divide the pie menu learning curve into three stages:<p>1) The first stage is how a new user typically uses it when they don't know the directions: click it up, look at the menu items, decide what you want, point at it, click it down. It requires lots of time, visual feedback, and mental attention, but it transparently trains you for later stages.<p>2) Then there's an intermediate state where the user knows the direction, presses down, moves, then looks at the screen, waits for the menu to draw and give some feedback that they've selected the right item, then finally releases the button to conform, or moves to correct the selection. It requires much less time, but still requires some visual attention and waiting for feedback before confirming the selection. But it reinforces previous learning, and builds muscle memory and confidence.<p>3) The final stage is when the user remembers the direction both mentally in ""neural memory"" and physically in ""muscle memory"", so they can just quickly flick in the correct direction and go on to their next task immediately, without looking at the menu or waiting for feedback. This requires the least amount of time and is the most fluid and satisfying way to use pie menus.<p>Carefully designed pie menus can seamlessly support all three stages, and both modes of interaction (click up, or press/drag/release). That enables users to smoothly escalate from one stage to the next.<p>There are several properties that dovetail together to make pie menus easier to learn:<p>1) Pie menus bridge between menus and gestures with a smooth learning curve.<p>Features that support expert users shouldn't get in the way of novice users: If you don't use pie menus very often, you can still use them easily without spending time or memory to learn your way around them. But using them in ""novice mode"" is rehearsal for using them in ""expert mode"", while they aren't any harder for novices to use because of that.<p>Features that support inexperienced users and learning, like fancy graphics to present menu on the screen, animate theatrical feedback and help illustrate and explain the selection, should not get in the way of the more efficient ways of using them as gestures.<p>To contrast: Drop down menus that display keyboard shortcuts suffer from increased size and cluttering, and using drop down menus with the mouse is not rehearsal for using drop down menus via keyboard shortcuts.<p>2) Pie menus are ""self revealing"": they show users the available options and their corresponding direction, so they are easy for new users to discover, use and learn.<p>To contrast: Normal invisible gesture recognition is not ""self revealing"", since they usually do not have a way for the user to discover what gestures are available and how to make them. Some gesture recognition systems have ""help dialogs"" that show and explain each available gesture, but stopping what you're doing to look at a help dialog to discover and learn the gestures is not the same thing as just using the gestures to get your work done, learning them while you're using them, without spending extra time on training.<p>3) Pie menus seamlessly support rehearsal. Stage 1 gestures are rehearsal for stage 2 gestures are rehearsal for stage 3 gestures.<p>Clicking up menus at stage 1 is rehearsal for stage 2, because it shows you the options and their directions, and lets your leisurely browse the menu at your own pace without stressfully holding down the mouse button.<p>At stage 1, it can incrementally reveal more information about the menu and items, while previewing and explaining the effects of the selection. Once you mentally remember the directions of the items you want, you smoothly advance to stage 2 without even noticing it.<p>Gesturing into menus and waiting for confirmation at stage 2 is rehearsal for stage 3, once you have enough physical muscle memory and confidence to quickly use gestures without looking at the screen or waiting for feedback.<p>Showing live in-world feedback, like previewing the effects of the current selection in real time during menu tracking, is an effective form of direct transparent feedback that reduces the need for indirect cluttered feedback with words and icons. This works well when using the distance as a parameter to the selection, so you can ""pull out"" sub-items (like colors) or linear parameters (like font size), and release the button when you're happy with what you see.<p>Both novice and expert users benefit from that kind of ""direct manipulation"" feedback, since it's better to keep your attention focused on the thing you're interacting with, not the menu.<p>Pie menus can be carefully designed to make learning the item directions easier, by exploiting the natural directional, opposite, orthogonal, linear relationships between items. For example: twelve items for a clock face of hours, astrological signs, months, etc; or eight items for compass directions, orthogonal pairs of opposite pairs that can be combined along diagonals (like good/evil, lawful/chaotic), etc.<p>A humaine user interface will explain why any menu items are disabled, and make it easy for you to do whatever is required to enabled them, instead of just graying them out and not telling you what's wrong when you try to select them.<p>Here's a demo of pie menus for Unity3D, that shows some of these ideas:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMN1LQ7qx9g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMN1LQ7qx9g</a>",1367079097

5618130,comment,5618035,5618035,93,0,shubb,,,"The problem with this article is that a lot of things that are cheap for one serving go stale before you eat the second.<p>For instance, on day one, he adds some mint which cost ~50p to buy, but he calls 1p because he only eats a little. He does not eat the rest of the mint that week, so it cost him ~50p, i.e. half the days budget.<p>I am poor and eat very cheap. I do that using dry bulk foods and frozen veg. This is important because there are opportunities for free meals (e.g. if customers at work do not eat all the sand witches and biscuits, that can be lunch for 2 days). Friends invite you for dinner too. If you buy food that spoils, opportunities like this come at a price.<p>How about this for a suggestion - mix lentils, buck wheat, brown rice, dried beans, quinoa. These come in 500g bags for about a pound. You need 6 spoons of this mix per meal, so 10 pounds of mix will last you several months. Put in a rice cooker for 40 min (some beans need soaking first), with a chicken stock cube. Cook for 20 mins then add mixed frozen veg. This will cost you about 30p per meal, and is pretty much complete [1].<p>I eat the above most of the time, and take free food whenever possible. At the end of the week, I treat myself to a ready meal. You can add curry spice or other herbs for variety. After a year of this I feel pretty healthy.<p>As an aside, supermarkets are machines for making you overbuy. Between BOGOF offers and big packs of meat (or small ones at a huge premium), it's very hard to shop there on a budget because they are designed to trick you into making 'bad' choices. Avoiding them by living on a non-spoiling diet saves tons.<p>[1] I think. The key to a healthy diet is variety, but if your basic meal is healthy and cheap, you can make sure to be eating other things from time to time.",1367078547

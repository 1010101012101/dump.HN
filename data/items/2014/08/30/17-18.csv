We&#x27;ve been doing it since we got our first job sacking groceries or folding sweaters. You&#x27;re paid a fixed rate because you&#x27;re not the one risking anything.<p>This isn&#x27;t &quot;The System&quot;. It&#x27;s just the labor market.<p><pre><code>    > My point is that if it takes so much effort...\n</code></pre>\nSo what? It takes effort. Everything does. Building something that produces value on your own whim takes effort just like satisfying the terms of a work contract or finding good contracting relationships in the first place.<p>Know what else takes effort? Building only what others pay you to build despite your ability to build anything. Not everyone is content with that. I reckon most of us don&#x27;t consider that the height of our life ambitions, but the alternatives aren&#x27;t as straightforward as dropping our CV into a dropbox. Hence this Ask HN submission.<p>Your posts are just selling some brand of status quo that we&#x27;re already familiar with.",1409421585

Asperger&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t folded into the parent category, instead those who were diagnosed with Asperger&#x27;s, and the symptom constellation it represented, were folded into the parent category. Asperger&#x27;s was abandoned.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html?pag...</a><p>Quote: &quot;Some experts worry that the <i>loss of the label</i> [emphasis added] will inhibit mildly affected people from being assessed for autism. “The general public has either a neutral or fairly positive view of the term Asperger’s syndrome,” said Tony Attwood, a psychologist based in Australia who wrote “The Complete Guide to Asperger’s Syndrome” (Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 2006). But if people are told they should be evaluated for autism, he went on, “they will say: ‘No, no, no. I can talk. I have a friend. What a ridiculous suggestion!’ So we will miss the opportunity to assess people.”&quot;<p>It&#x27;s clear from the above that we&#x27;re talking about a <i>label</i>, not a <i>diagnosis</i>. The label has been abandoned, and those seeking a diagnosis du jour with have to settle for Autism, universally regarded as undesirable.<p>The thinking was that, if people with an Asperger&#x27;s diagnosis knew they would be recategorized as autistic, this would reduce the diagnosis rate to something more consistent with reality, and the immediate motivation for the change was to halt an epidemic of nonsense diagnoses.<p>> The same is true for thousands of others, and we&#x27;re kind of tired of you psychology deniers telling us that we don&#x27;t exist.<p>You mean, along with all responsible psychiatrists and psychologists, all of whom now realize their mistake in allowing this diagnosis to come into existence?<p>Your protest is on a par with someone who feels that his religious beliefs have been disparaged or discriminated against. I say this because <i>Asperger Syndrome does not exist</i>. The mental health profession now agrees and, by removing Asperger&#x27;s from the DSM, has taken steps to signal clinicians to avoid use of <i>the label</i>.<p>As to &quot;psychology deniers&quot;, you may not be aware that the present chairman of the NIMH has recently ruled that the DSM may no longer be used as the basis for scientific research proposals, for the simple reason that it has no scientific content:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-rats-of-n-i-m-h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-rats-of-n-i-m-h</a><p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>The first step was the elimination of Asperger&#x27;s from the DSM. The second step is the elimination of the DSM from serious conversation among scientists. So, tell me, which part of this recitation of real events is causing you the most personal anguish?<p>In closing, I want to say something that you ought to find reassuring -- <i>you&#x27;re not a diagnosis, you&#x27;re a human being</i>. The Asperger&#x27;s story proves that diagnoses don&#x27;t have rights and can be abandoned without warning. But human beings have inalienable rights, and cannot be abandoned. Start thinking of yourself as a human being -- see how it works out for you.",1409421313

Yeah, we still have got some work to do there.<p>If you register, though, you&#x27;ll become a part of a community built for sharing knowledge about what&#x27;s happening, and where to find cool stuff to explore. At least, we got a gut feeling saying the patterns we implement allow the community to grow in that direction.<p>For example, there is no friending/following. All conversations are open for everybody to see. And we allow people to vote both up and down.

Some background, I&#x27;m a engineer at a YC company in San Francisco. I was also looking for a passive income side project and after a few attempts from scratch sputtered I happened upon a website auction at flippa.com for an interesting webapp: www.postrgram.com<p>I spoke with the owner over Skype about it, he&#x27;d run the site for a couple years, had invested a lot of time into getting the licensed mosaic software tuned correctly, but had put virtually nothing into marketing and was still printing orders himself with a giant industrial Canon printer. Not surprisingly he was tired of it. I realized the printing process could be automated and business could potentially be expended by integrating with Facebook and offering a free digital option if the customer allowed a post on their wall. Long story short I bought 80% of the business a few weeks ago and I&#x27;m working on those things right now. I&#x27;m sure there will be snags in the road but I&#x27;m on my way toward my primary goal of getting a product on the market that will not require my time to run on a day-to-day basis. Currently income is less than 1000/month but I hope to see that grow.<p>My advice when thinking about a project like this yourself (and it&#x27;s fine to start from scratch, though that&#x27;s not what I did) is to take the basic tenants of running a startup to heart and just apply them on a micro scale:<p>1) let the real world inform your choices. In my case I happened upon a product that already had some validation. In your case maybe you just need to find that one pain-point you can help solve. Always be thinking of ideas, ask your friends, read a lot.<p>2) be efficient. get good at rapid prototyping and shipping ideas for validation. Always be asking yourself this question: is this the most valuable thing I can be doing with my time right now? Force yourself to move fast. You&#x27;ll get better at learning what works and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>3) Consider finding a partner who you can join forces with. Two people can be more effective than the sum of their parts. Not to mention expanding your network of friends and contacts is in many ways more valuable than wealth.<p>4) follow the money. It sounds crass but after all it is the goal and it&#x27;s also the most tangible effect of providing value to someone. Even at a micro scale if you&#x27;re not converting customers it&#x27;s a red flag.<p>5) my personal style is to be  be wary of saturated markets like social networks, mobile apps, etc. on the flip-side i personally feel there&#x27;s potential in the blogging landscape and popular product integrations (like widgets).<p>Sorry that ran a little long, I&#x27;m on a road trip right now (not driving), just some stream of thought ideas.

Just like other industries medicine has been turned into an assembly line where patients are herded through the system with professionals at each level of the training pyramid doing their part.  We do this to be efficient and cost effective, but speaking from personal experience, the side effect is that information gets lost from transfer to transfer and a patient has less time to bond with a doctor.

Indeed if other people are going to have to spend time reinventing the wheel I suppose some might even see it as a competitive advantage. And as a general rule, video games companies don&#x27;t seem to be much into open source anyway.<p>(Additionally, if the ones I&#x27;ve used are anything to go by, the libraries <i>aren&#x27;t</i> so great. They attack specific problems with std::vector, and that&#x27;s fine, but usually not in any general way. No need to do a full extension of the allocator mechanism if you know you can just call your company&#x27;s allocator&#x27;s special try_realloc function, for example - but now of course nobody else can use it.

8246946,comment,8246800,8246880,0,0,lutusp,,,"> You ignore the fact that scientific fraud exists in other sciences<p>It&#x27;s not the topic under discussion, but scientific fraud certainly exists among scientists, with one important difference -- real scientists are exposed by comparing their work, their evidence, to reality. Stapel was exposed by comparing his words to his work -- work often not even conducted. There was never any serious prospect of comparing Stapel&#x27;s work to reality, because his work didn&#x27;t try to address reality -- that&#x27;s science&#x27;s purview.<p>In science, reliant on physical evidence, how you describe the evidence shouldn&#x27;t matter, the evidence should speak for itself. Reliable evidence should bring different, similarly equipped observers to the same conclusion. In psychology, the reason there&#x27;s no consensus on the meaning of evidence is because the evidence is extremely poor, freeing different psychologists to draw different conclusions from the same evidence.<p>> this article talks about extending the use of this tool to different sciences.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s true, they do talk about it. But until they actually try to apply it, it&#x27;s not a legitimate topic of discussion.<p>You haven&#x27;t asked an obvious question -- where are the falsifiable psychological theories, theories that can be proven false in practical tests, but that resist falsification? Where are the time-tested theories that would make psychology one field, like physics or biology, and that would justify clinical practice?",1409418859
8246945,comment,8246005,8246688,11,0,mrottenkolber,,,"Nice uppercut.<p>mcendella I despise you. Obviously you have never been the victim of the police. Even if she did a roundhouse kick knocking him down and teabagged him afterwards that would be no excuse for her treatment.<p>There is a difference between a violent protester and a violent policeman. The policeman is trained and armed. He is also getting paid to suppress the protest. The protester on the other hand has a non-commercial agenda, which might be idealistic and in a way not voluntary. The protester has no combat training, no armor. The protester does not choose to enter a violent conflict with the police. The police on the other hand chooses to act as a more often that not active, as opposed to passive, violent force opposed to the protest.<p>During duty, police officers do not deserve the protection of civil law. It can not be crime to insult, hurt or kill a police officer during a heated protest, as it is no crime for a police officer to insult, hurt or kill a civillian in the course of his duty.<p>To argue on this specific case, there appears to be proof that she was groped. So there should be a sexual harrassment charge (might be dropped due to &quot;not on purpose&quot;). She <i>reacted</i> violently, within seven seconds. In germany thats called &quot;Affekt&quot;. Completely legal, actually she had the right to spontaniously choke the guy even if he was civillian (in germany, as long as she was fast enough).<p>So lets just say the cops <i>had</i> a reason to arrest her (btw on a protest cops usually arrest anyone for anything, because why not), they beat her up doing so.<p>Quote from your video: &quot;Is she getting beat up?&quot;, &quot;Yes, shes getting beat up.&quot;<p>So why are those guys not tried and sentenced to fucking death (what do you have the death sentence for again)? Even I could arrest that girl without hurting her ffs. These guys should be trained to do so.<p>To sum this up, the mind of a violent protester goes something like this:<p>&quot;Fuck they&#x27;re gonna hurt/kill me, im scared im enraged im panicking, i want to get out of this situation.&quot;<p>The mind of a police officer during a protest goes something like this (actually exactly):<p>&quot;Fucking protesters, im standing here like an idiot, these fucking broad minded fuckers. Hey, wait, did she just kinda look violent? FINALLY a reason why I can assault one of these fucks.&quot;<p>I got hit by a baton once[1], trying to escape out of a &quot;Kessel&quot; (a circle of policement surounding protesters while throwing tear gas inside). Hit my leg, beside my leg being fucked, i weant deaf for ten minutes (might be an adrenaline/pain/shock think who knows). And thats nothing. I&#x27;ve seen 13 year old girls getting beaten by 4 cops with batons and cops spraying maze into your face from a 1 foot distance because you decided to shout at them.<p>These are not rare cases. This happens on every protest, its the police&#x27;s job to make it happen on every protest.<p>If you ever get arrested during a protest, you can count on being beat up during that arrest. Also expect verbal assault. Unless you are verbally assaulted multiple times during arrest, you must have met a jesus-like cop.<p>Try it for yourself, there are some things that will get you arrested which will actually not be procecuted (in germany thats for instance being masked), also try to run away when they try to arrest you otherwise you might not get the whole getting kneed in the back while on the ground experience. Its a pretty weird feeling. Afterwards go to a doctor, tell him you&#x27;ve been beaten up. Watch their concerned facial expression while asking you &quot;Who&#x27;d do such a thing?&quot;. I bet you don&#x27;t feel nearly as violated as the doctor thinks you have been.[2]<p>So I must say, every time someone gets sentenced for hurting a police officer during protest:<p>BOO FUCKING HOO, poor little officer. Really. Poor personfied violence of the state. You got hurt, during your job, which is to hurt adversaries of the state. Someone should play a violin.<p>Edited, footnotes:\n[1] I think I was 16, it was a counter protest against a Neo-nazi parade.\n[2] Also first hand experience. I was 17, it was a student protest for better education. I have video footage. No charges against me but I have a medical certificate that I was violated.<p>PS: If you think I am a radical activist. Quite the opposite, the few protests I have been to made me stay far away of any kind of police presence (including protests) since then. Its telling that of five protests I&#x27;ve been to in my life, on four I would consider having seen serious human rights violations.",1409418852

I am 100% sure no one outside of the PHP community cares about anything Facebook has done in C++.<p>Simply having a large company with lots of developers who might have even had good reputations elsewhere or even be smart doesn&#x27;t mean much.

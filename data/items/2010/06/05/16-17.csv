I found this passage interesting:<p>""By this account, there are no metaphysical or epistemological problems special to mathematics. The only worries left are the general worries about non-mathematical physics, and about fiction in general. Field's approach has been very influential, but is widely rejected. This is in part because of the requirement of strong fragments of second-order logic to carry out his reduction, and because the statement of conservativity seems to require quantification over abstract models or deductions.""<p>I will admit that I have a problem when fictionalism requires that we regard ""2 + 2 = 4"" as false (also from wikipedia).

1407073,comment,1406902,1406902,0,0,mdasen,,,"The article points out a definite possibility.  However, I prefer to be optimistic.  Usage fees could give carriers a large motivation to make their networks faster and add capacity.  As carriers increase capacity and speed, they will likely compete with each other to drive down prices per unit of usage.  Right now, most carriers are offering 5GB for $30 and AT&T just made it 2GB for $25.  That said, I can't see that pricing sticking around for long.  As the four carriers push into 4G in the coming year, there will be intense competition to offer users data services.  As capacity increases, carriers will take into consideration that increase as well as the cost of building that increase and figure out what they can offer more cheaply.<p>Usage fees aren't bad when they're modest.  Most of us pay for heat and electricity that way.  For those of us who have a server, we get an allocation of bandwidth and overages are usually very reasonable - or with Amazon, you pay for what you use.  Now, telecoms haven't always had the nicest pricing structures in the past, but I remember when long-distance service became very competitive and the price of minutes sunk.  I'm hoping that the combination of 4G and two new entrants to the wireless world (Cricket and MetroPCS) will make data look more like long distance service.<p>Usage fees aren't terrible.  Carriers do have costs to increase capacity and by charging those who are using that capacity, they have an incentive to build a good network and don't end up making light users subsidize heavy users.  We must be vigilant that usage fees aren't onerous or out of line with costs, but I'm hoping that the combination of competition and increased capacity will keep prices down.",1275756469

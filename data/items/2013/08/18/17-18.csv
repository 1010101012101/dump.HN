This works because (1) inflation reduces your effective net expenditure on the car; (2) you can take the cash you would have spent on the car and invest it instead; if you even conservatively get 3% returns a year, you&#x27;ve still come out far ahead.<p>Regarding (2), if you can&#x27;t afford the car in cash, then you can&#x27;t afford the car. That&#x27;s always been my motto. Financing is a choice; it should never be something you are forced to do, unless this is your first car straight out of school and you just have no money yet.",1376848728

In his perception, going ahead and posting on Zuckerberg&#x27;s timeline was just another step toward that goal.<p>Breaking the rules is a somewhat glorified thing in hacker circles, and this may have contributed to his attitude. Of course, what they don&#x27;t tell you when they say &quot;break all the rules&quot; is that only works out if you actually win in the end. And winning is an event often contingent on getting someone important to like you.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, all of that probably wasn&#x27;t done in bad faith, but it wasn&#x27;t a constructive process either. It&#x27;s something someone very inexperienced would do if they were desperate for a job in the USA.

Standard courses that all M.E.&#x27;s take generally don&#x27;t cover topics like this. Instead, you deal at a more fundamental level with courses such as physics, calculus, statics and dynamics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, material sciences, etc. When other majors were allowed to take pretty much any elective, we were required to take 400 level engineering electives. This is where you had the option of choosing courses that would teach this sort of stuff. For example, I took a course in gear design which covered topics related to this. Another engineering elective I took was vehicle dynamics. Robotics courses are often an option for students as well.<p>As far as texts go, I would just search Google or Amazon for &quot;Machine design&quot;. I don&#x27;t have any particular recommendations because at the time I viewed text books with the same level of excitement as most other students, which is to say none at all.

Since then there has been a shift toward new development being done in C++ such that the vast majority of new server engines I know about are being developed in C++ (mostly C++11) across a diverse range of companies. The reasons are practical and reflect the evolution of hardware.<p>The short version is that on current hardware C++ is much more efficient, both in terms of throughput per core and can achieve integer factor improvements in absolute performance relative to the JVM. Most of the differences are boil down to two things. First, server performance tends to be bound by memory performance and the JVM is quite a bit worse than what is easily achievable in C++. Second, an optimal high-performance server engine design in C++ is difficult to express within the JVM so basic design of the engine kernel tends to be less efficient as well.<p>In large-scale systems, that starts to add up in terms of power and hardware consumption and companies are more sensitive to this than they used to be. C++ currently offers significantly better characteristics and using less hardware to do it.",1376848132

Your claim is like saying that auto accidents are caused by cars getting too close together. That&#x27;s only a symptom of an underlying cause.<p>> I see where you&#x27;re coming from, but the differences between pneumonia and cancer aren&#x27;t as great as you think.<p>We know what causes pneumonia. Because of this, we can suggest behaviors that will prevent it before the fact, we can identify it unambiguously, and we can cure it after the fact. This isn&#x27;t true about cancer -- we don&#x27;t know what causes it, therefore we cannot proactively prevent it, we can&#x27;t identify it very efficiently (there are always false negatives and positives) and we cannot cure it. There&#x27;s no comparison.<p>> They can test for the presence of the pathogen, but they can&#x27;t ever say you are &quot;cured&quot;.<p>Of course they can. In infectious disease, they can test for the presence of the causative pathogen -- no pathogen, no disease. In cancer, to do this, we would first need to identify the cause. But <i>we don&#x27;t know the cause</i>, we only know the effect.<p>> In cancer you can test for the presence of the mutated cells (minimum residual disease).<p>This is like saying we can test for the presence of a car crash by measuring bent bumpers and inflated airbags. That measures effects, not causes.<p>> Often what they&#x27;ll do is count the mutated cells from a biopsy, and with this current treatment, the number of remaining cells is less than the lower limit of detection.<p>Counting abnormal cells only reveals how little we know. We detect cancer by detecting abnormal cell growth. We measure progress in symptomatic treatment by counting abnormal cells. We declare a remission by making that count approach zero using agents that kill abnormal cells. There are any number of cases where the count of cancerous cells was below the limit of detection, but still caused a recurrence.<p>In 1979, smallpox was declared to have been globally eradicated. How? By identifying the responsible pathogen, then systematically destroying it everywhere it appeared. This was only possible because we know what caused smallpox, and we could treat the cause, not the symptoms. Because of what we knew, we were able to call smallpox permanently cured.<p>We cannot do this with cancer, because we don&#x27;t know enough about how it works. All we can do is tell people to avoid risky behaviors, behaviors that, for often-unclear reasons, increase one&#x27;s chance to contract this disease. Then, once the disease&#x27;s symptoms appear, we have crude methods to deal with it, like trying to kill the cell masses that represent the disease&#x27;s primary symptom.<p>Based on a comparison with other diseases, cancer treatment is unbelievably primitive -- it would be like treating a finger infection by cutting off a person&#x27;s hand. And guess what? Before germ theory and before antibiotics, that <i>was</i> the treatment -- cut off the infected limb before the infection spread through the body.<p>The reason we don&#x27;t tell people they&#x27;re cured of cancer is because of science. In science, there are no fairy tales -- everything depends on evidence. And we don&#x27;t have the evidence science requires to declare cancer cured.",1376847086

They are subjected to strong bounds, etc. It is &quot;impossible&quot; to have, say, >1% of a country&#x27;s population dying from falls from ladders the same year. The chances are less than 1 in several trillion trillion trillion years. Hence a journalistic statement about risk converges to the scientific statement.<p>B- Terrorism is fat tailed. Your estimation from past data has monstrous errors. A record of the people who died last few years has very very little predictive powers of how many will die the next year, and is biased downward. One biological event can decimate the population.<p>May be &quot;reasonable&quot; to claim that terrorism is overhyped, that our liberty is more valuable, etc. I believe so. But the comparison here is a fallacy and sloppy thinking is dangerous. (Worse, Koppel compares terrorism today to terrorism 100 years ago when a terrorist could inflict very limited harm.)<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Another such case is Nuclear Weapons, Millions of dollars are spent on controlling proliferation of nuclear weapons, even when no one died last year because of them.

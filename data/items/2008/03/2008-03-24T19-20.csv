There are 9 items on this bar, but they are not all the same kind of item.<p>The first 4 (Hacker News, new, threads, and comments) are different views of the same data, so they should be tabs.<p>Leaders, jobs, and <login id> should be links (blue underlined) because they take you to another page, not another view.<p>Submit and logout should be buttons.<p>I would change ""Hacker News"" to ""Popular"" and I would put the ""New"" tab first, because the Popular view is the default.  I still get confused by the ""threads"" and ""comments"" tabs (now what are these, again?)<p>Why do I make these suggestions?<p>Because we are all so used to the site, it's almost impossible for us to visualize how noobies see it.  We really need to think about how to better direct people to the new page more often and more easily, without making it the default page.  I think the biggest problem is that too many good stories never gain enough traction to graduate to the popular page.  If a good story falls to 31st on the new page without an upvote, we'll probably never see it again.  This happens often because new posts come in faster than people get to vote for them.<p>I often read a story that I think is fascinating and wonder how people here will react to it, so I submit it, only to find it disappearing without any upvotes or comments.  On the other hand, sometimes my submission takes off to the top of the front page.  I realize that I probably think a little differently that a lot of people, but not THAT MUCH differently.  Sometimes, I think, it's just timing.  Thus, the ""It fell off the new page too fast"" hypothesis.<p>Just a thought.  Of course, if the data suggests otherwise, then never mind.",1206388775

144895,comment,144808,144870,0,0,lisper,,,"> That's sort of a semantic debate, isn't it?<p>No.<p>There's one very significant difference between a VC and YC.  VC's invest other people's money.  YC doesn't.  VC's may also invest their own money, but this is incidental to their primary business, which is to assemble investment portfolios for other people to invest in.  They charge a fee for this, and many VC's make most of their money from these fees, not from the returns on the investments.<p>This has real consequences.  VC's are much more risk-averse than YC, because if they have a bad year it can put them out of business.  (No one will want to invest their money in a VC which lost money for their previous investors.)  If YC has a bad year they can just shrug it off, learn from the experience, and try again.<p>This dynamic also changes the VC's risk posture in another way.  A VC has much more to lose from a loss than they have to gain from a really big win.  If a VC has a really big win, most of the money goes to the investors, not to the VC.  The VC's primary benefit from a Really Big Win will be that more people will want to participate in their next round of investments, which is nice, but that in and of itself doesn't make you a billionaire.  So VC's are much more interested in avoiding loss than in going after a Really Big Win.  YC, by contrast, has nothing to lose from a loss except the money they put in (which is not much), and a lot to gain from a Really Big Win (since they are the investor).  This makes YC willing to take much bigger gambles than a VC would.  It also aligns YC's interests with the interests of the companies they invest in, since the bigger the company wins, the bigger YC wins.",1206386652

My co-founder and I frequently waffle over which path to take, and so far have stayed the course of staying small with steadily increasing revenue over taking a bunch of investment and growing really fast.  Both companies do have an exit plan, but it's a little further out and the intention is to make sure its on our own terms.  pg has never indicated dissatisfaction with this path...even though it means the exit won't come quickly, as it did with reddit, Zenter, Parakey, etc. and thus YC won't see return on these businesses for at least a couple more years.<p>Of course, once one has a profitable exit, and optionally vests, you're then completely free to work in any environment you want.  Which means you could do what Paul Buchheit did with his Googlebucks, and start a company that does exactly the work you want to do on the terms you want to do them on (and it turns out he wants to grow really fast, since he raised 5mil for FriendFeed).  Which brings me back to what I think pg's real theme and logical conclusion is.  pg likes to see people make something really great, really fast, and then make a really lot of money because of it.  Once you've done that, you're then freed up to do anything you want (maybe after spending some time in a cage with your lion co-founders, while vesting)--including doing it all again.",1206386333

The first question you need to ask yourself is: are you read-bound or write-bound?<p>A ""generic"" advice for databases is that you -don't- want to have multiple small boxes when one big box will do.  Managing many machines is complex both from the sysadmin and developer points of view.  Instead, get a machine with as much ram as you can and disks as fast as possible (raid 0 really helps), cpu doesn't matter too much for databases.  Obviously, don't expect to run your DB on a i486 ;-)<p>If your box can't cope with writes (disk too slow), you'll need to either increase the write speed of your machine again (more disks in a raid 0 array) or ""shard"" your data.  You want to avoid that as much as you can, not fun.<p>If your box is read-bound (ie: is slow at reading), then you can start thinking about replication to multiple machines.<p>But quite frankly, I think you got it all wrong.  Don't bother about scaling and improving performance now because it's almost impossible for you to know where the bottleneck is going to be anyways.<p>I've never used Symfony, so I don't know anything particular about it, but I don't think the framework is going to cause problems database-wise.",1206385550

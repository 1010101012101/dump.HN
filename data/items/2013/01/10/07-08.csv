5035998,comment,5032855,5033578,2,0,jacoblyles,,,"Your support of public monopoly education is interesting to me, as your comments on this thread make you sound like a thoughtful, well-informed person. Presumably there are some aspects of public monopoly education you would like to change. Do you support seniority-based pay scales, strong unions, and teacher tenure?<p>There's a few education economists that have noted that if we could fire the worst 7% of teachers in the US and replace them with merely average teachers, then the US would have the best schools in the world (Eric Hanushek out of Stanford is one). This is a vital and cheap policy for us to carry out, but it is well-known that you can't get fired from government jobs. I can't imaging school systems being the first to change.<p>Do you think it is politically possible to reform the worst parts of the public monopoly school systems with its current structure? School boards in population-dense areas are often staffed exclusively with union representatives. What model of the world convinces you that these school bureaucracies will do what is right for the students?<p>I find the arguments for student educational choice to be compelling. In a place like Washington DC, I think it will be much more effective to simply pay for the students to attend good schools than to reform schools that have been horrible (and overfunded!) for decades.",1357804701

I think for some folks this is a sore spot--that the phrase ""wife"", spoken by a man, is <i>also</i> an open admission of sexuality--so why can't we have a word like that, dammit? We're looking for a language which lets us express an integral part of our lives in a way which is normal to other people.<p>In ""Covering"", Kenji Yoshino talks about the strange dance that LGBT people go through. You continually gauge the situation--sometimes overtly, sometimes subconsciously. ""Is it worth it?"" ""Can I give my boyfriend a hug at this service station?"" ""Should we just break down and get separate beds at the hotel? It'll be <i>easier</i>."" ""Have we told his Aunt yet, or are am I just a friend in town for Thanksgiving?""<p>In San Francisco, at least for me, this tension is practically absent--but in rural Minnesota and Wisconsin, it was a very real part of my life.

5035974,comment,5031283,5031283,1,0,drivebyacct2,,,"So many people missing the point of the gay analogy in this thread and once again, at the mere hint of the concept of privilege, people race to get defensive and shut their ears before even understanding the issue at play; further showing that people continue to have knee-jerk reactions to the phrase ""privilege"" just as some think that ""feminism"" = ""hates men"" instead of ""wants gender equality"".<p>To explain further, there's two issues:<p>1. That my sexuality is a topic that I constantly have to correct people on. It hurts because of internalized homophobia from two decades of growing up in the Midwest. It hurts because it's a constant reminder that I'm a minority and that people make incorrect assumptions about me. It hurts because it's annoying. I had a friend that would introduce me as ""DriveBy, my gay friend"". That's the sort of feeling I get when I have to stop and say ""No, I'm gay"". Hell, I even have some awkward feeling when it's someone I suspect is homophobic because <i>I</i> don't want to make <i>them</i> uneasy.<p>2. When I correct people on my sexuality, I've challenged their assumptions. I've changed their perspective and reminded them that not everyone is straight, even the people that ""oh my god, I never would have guessed"". This isn't about ""shoving sexuality in peoples' faces"". It's not about evangelizing LGBT issues every day just to force it.",1357803881

I guess we can go 'did so/did not' on this one, but instead let's agree to disagree.<p>""but your reply is agressive""<p>Oh yeah, that was intentional, because I felt angry at the post, and in a way that I feel vindicates an aggressive attempt to restrain posts like the one we're talking about. Whether or not making aggressive posts on the internet serves that purpose is another question, although I guess the answer is ""no, plus it makes you look like a douche"" ('you', in this case, being me, just to make sure I'm being clear ;) )<p>""it might be worth familiarizing yourself with the kind of behavior that is accepted and expected here.""<p>Sorry to pull <i>that</i> card on you, but I've been posting here quite a bit longer than you have, and lurking long time before that - and I long for the days where the type of comment like we're talking about now wouldn't have been posted at all, or the days just after those, where that type of comment would have (rightfully) been down voted into near-unintelligible grey right with the 'LOL', 'me too' and 'ur a faggot' posts. Sadly, those days seem to be long gone, and irrational ideologies seem to have become an accepted basis for posts.<p>""It seems even stranger when you consider the OP didn't even mention some of the points you are berating him with""<p>Not sure what you mean specifically - although to be fair, I did cover my ass by not berating him directly, and instead cowering behind a generalization of unspecified 'other' posts, only indicating that his 'falls in that general class'. Still I stand behind my point that my understanding of implied statements is completely in line with the content of my reply.<p>""Back on topic - I can't wait until there is some kind of global iDEAL system, it is so much more convenient than credit cards.""<p>How so? Look, I use iDEAL myself (I used it 3 times just yesterday, even), and like it in the cases where it works, but two months ago I rented a car in a New Zealand airport terminal from a guy who had his whole office in his backpack (you know, the old-fashioned stencil paper credit card processing machine). How would that work with a direct debit system? I paid with credit cards in remote villages in Peru and I can pay or make reservations across the world with credit cards on the phone by just passing them my CC number. Furthermore, I have never paid a cent in interest charges on a credit card, payments are done in full, automatically, from my bank account. I'm not sure what the aversion against credit cards is, it's incredibly useful in many situations. I'd be perfectly happy traveling the world with just a Visa card (provided I can withdraw some cash locally in some places...), I have yet to see anything remotely as convenient as that. I paid more for withdrawing cash with my Maestro card in Spain last summer as I would have had I just paid for everything with my credit card FFS!<p>Here, let me throw in some more ranting against my country: you know why merchants don't accept credit cards in the Netherlands? Because it costs money, and the merchant mentality here is not 'the customer is always right and his convenience is something I need to think of', but 'I need to make sure I get paid, and as much as possible'. Merchants (not only online, I'd even say 'less so online') think of themselves much more as superiors to customers than those in more customer-oriented markets. There is a reason that 'boter bij de vis' doesn't have a direct similar construct in other languages such as English and Frech (that I know of) (it means: pay directly when items are received, no credit allowed). It probably also stems from the Protestant ethic: credit is a sin. Which I think is an even more daft reason to be adverse of credit.<p>(so it looks like I didn't manage to restrain myself after all - so be it)",1357803874

As I get older, like the OP, I'm seeing Entrepreneurialism and, personally, Agorism as two of the many strategies that should be focused on to influence people, mostly non statist capilists who don't innovate as much as they should, to change their philosophies so that disruptions, subsidies, and investments can occur in various other markets here in Puerto Rico besides the pharmaceutical.<p>I don't classify myself as libertarian, I'm all about direct democracy and believe highly in sovereignty, however the ongoing regulations and the centralization and manipulation of the housing sector, the energy sector, and the food and liquor sector here in PR have gone overboard just like in the states and it has lead me to believe that all of this is caused by us submitting into conformity after we have generate a bit of passive income without focusing on taking down some barriers and instead we're maneuvering around them.<p>Why the hell does someone that has a self sufficient house, windmills, solar panels and all, takes water from a deep well STILL have to pay a minimum electricity bill or the government would regulate his energy and tax him like if he were to be selling it. To us country folk that do not like to be taxed on our own property, this sort of regulation is going to be taken down- it'll only get worse when more ways to decentralize markets happen and we get our hands in them like 3d printing.<p>I'm naive and you can justify calling me a fool but this is modern day slavery, and that's what the article is generally touching upon. Not sure if the above was the best example, but to me it's the most relational.<p>We're obligated, enslaved, to fix many problems that we haven't caused on top of worrying about the elderly before we retire, as shown by some of the comments here- no problem, people had it harder back in the days..Especially here in PR. Have you seen Clint Eastwood's Super Bowl Half time commercial? That's what came to my mind after finishing reading this..<p>Besides showing an interest in a certain market by crowdfunding capital and displaying market interest how can one influence non statist capitalists to invest lets say in informing the majority of the Puerto Rican population to take the current issues we should really be focusing on seriously? I know my kind and they're not generally inclined to think on these things day by day but please be kind enough to criticize my philosophy.

It includes an editor and an email program, which are composed into a single program/image. In contrast, the Unix functionality (vim,sendmail) is split into separate programs.<p>What is the difference between a function call and a program invocation? In both cases we have a name and maybe some arguments. In both cases the computer executes some code bound to that name parameterized with our arguments. The difference is primarily, how expensive is the name resolution. A shell command requires inspecting $PATH, looking through directories, fork/exec another program, which is a lot syscalls. A function call in the best case has been compiled to a ""call"" instruction, whose cost depends on the branch prediction. Of course, there are various levels in between (dynamically linked libraries, plugins, shell builtins, etc). There are more complex composition methods like SAAS or cloud computing. There are more efficient methods (inlining optimization).<p>Semantically, it is interesting <i>when</i> a name is resolved. Compiled languages (C,Go) usually do this statically at compile time, where C is even more restrictive as it only looks above in the code. Dynamic languages (Python,Ruby) do it at runtime.

5035886,comment,5035023,5035044,36,0,patio11,,,"(Bah, great point about passwords.  I need to reform my ways.)<p>To amplify and expand on Thomas here: when this was announced I pushed the Big Red Button and pushed three emergency patches to my servers at 3 to 5 AM Japan time.  My perception was ""This just can't wait.""  I went to sleep with the vague feeling that I had probably broken something (there's always <i>something</i> that slips when you're tired and hasty) but that it was almost certainly acceptable given the alternative.<p>Sure enough: despite automated and smoke tests passing and metrics remaining nominal, Appointment Reminder suffered breaking downtime for some customers (it depended on browser - long story not relevant).  This ended up locking them out for about 16 hours, felicitously mostly not during the US working day.<p>After being told of the issue by a few mighty pissed end users, I fixed it and spent a second awake-to-9 AM night both writing a to-all-customers apology email and fielding questions.  I went into detail on why I screwed up (acted too fast) and a simplified version of why I had to (third-party software required an urgent patch; delaying deployment by one day would have been an unacceptable risk to customer data).<p>Several customers - including a few of the ones most inconvenienced - got it touch to say ""Right call.""  One of them was of the opinion that, if I hadn't patched, <i>he</i> would be in Big Red Button mode today, because <i>no machine or data on a local network with an unpatched Rails instance is safe</i>.  ""I honestly prefer knowing it broke because you were on top of things than it being stable because you weren't"" end quote.<p>I'm not a security guy, I'm just a systems engineer, but my take on it is that this does not just require the Big Red Button, this is the paradigmatic example of why you <i>have</i> a Big Reg Button.  If you don't, or if you pushed it yesterday like you should have and something blew up, this is an excellent opportunity to improve procedures for next time.<p>Edit: Big Red Button is funny shorthand for ""Immediately drop what you're doing, pull out the In Case Shit Happens folder, and have the relevant people immediately execute on the emergency plan.""  We call it something different in big Japanese megacorps but I always liked the imagery.",1357801623

She buys (new, thank god) bras from random sellers on eBay several times per year, and it's always some kind of roulette because price seems entirely uncorrelated with quality.  I showed her True&Co and she likes it.<p>It's a little different from shoes (she also seems to buy a lot from Zappos, using the buy 3 and return 2 model, not sure how that works for them...), in that you don't show off underwear as much, but for some reason I think this model will work.<p>I'm constantly amazed at how imaginary or brand-specific sizing seems to be for female clothing. I love being able to just buy an L or XL and have it fit ok, or call up a tailor and say ""would like 3 more shirts the same measurements as last time"" (or do a fitting).",1357801248

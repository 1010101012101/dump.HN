We all know woefully boring 25-year-olds and exciting, bleeding-edge 50-somethings, I'm sure.<p>That said, teens and 20-somethings tend to have much more time and energy on their hands -- and a tendency not to be stuck in old ruts. But I imagine they're also much more chaotic and restless. And simply inexperienced. Which could be problematic.",1174866382

With the launch of my start-up couple months ago I hit that partial success I was looking at.<p>I am just in a helpless state of doing my own thing and not caring much about college. I still haven't dropped out or taken a year off but I plan my day around my venture rather than classes. Sticking with the minimum 12hrs is helpful.<p>Being in college in and of itself isn't a bad thing. You can work tirelessly on your venture across the desk from someone else working tirelessly on a school paper. ",1174863914

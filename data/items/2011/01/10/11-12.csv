2088173,comment,2085601,2087235,0,0,patrickk,,,"Perhaps the point I was trying to make wasn't clear.<p>Certain enterprise customers will always want to work with what they know, (i.e. typically Windows XP and Microsoft Office currently.) So this will be the long tail that Microsoft will coast along, if/when consumers migrate their personal computing to other platforms. Granted, there are certain situations when using an older technology such as mainframes makes complete sense, and there is little benefit to risk a major system upgrade; but there are many other situations where not upgrading seems lunacy (e.g. in an era when people want to have much of their banking online, the old mainframes in the background struggle to cope with the demand.)<p>As an aside, I interned at a bank where one of the tasks I did was adding HTML tags to predefined paragraphs that were in plain English. I did this in Excel, manually, line by line, on a PC sporting Windows XP and a 15"" monitor. This could have been done in seconds with a shell script if anyone there had a clue. This kind of ignorance is a godsend to Microsoft who will continue to sell software licences to clueless companies for the foreseeable future.",1294660738

For a founder with a technical background like me its hard to sometimes get the thinking off of the details of implementation. I like to think and work on architecture, under-the-hood features, scalability etc, but in the end it wont matter if noone uses the product. Users dont see and dont care for any of that, they want to you improve what they deal with everyday. So you have to find a good balance between that to make your product better but still work on the overall technical structure to keep things smoothly.\nAlso marketing probably is much more important than the quality of your code or even app.",1294660698

On a PC with an CGA/MDA you could damage the monitor power supply by putting the CRTC in a mode incompatible with the video input. Legend says you could make smoke go out of an MDA monitor.<p>At that time, it was also much harder for viruses to propagate - they would have to infect files and disks.

All of a sudden I feel trashy for making logical choices.<p>I think the author misjudged why people like me choose Ruby and vim -- choices that have nothing to do with each other, btw.<p>I'm a fan of terseness and readability. Ruby has a reputation for both. I've never heard the following phrases spoken: ""Perl is great for writing DSL's."" ""Perl is very readable.""<p>The most amazing experience has been going on GitHub on day one, reading the Rails, Haml, Sinatra, Tilt, you name it, code and being able to understand virtually any part of it. This is not only a testament to the language, but also a testament to the quality of the frameworks and the API's that are being produced with it. Show me a web framework written in Perl that I can dig into and understand with zero Perl experience.<p>Vim, on the other hand, is a sour-sweet topic. Here is the only reason I'm using vim: everything else sucks ___. Vim also sucks ____ because in 2011 it is still a text editor that can't copy paste using the ""normal people"" shortcuts. I'm looking forward to the day I finally customize vim enough to match Notepad in usability.<p>As much as vim usability sucks, I know that I can spend a year customizing it (and it will take a year) and be able to rely on it for the rest of my life. In contrast, there is no such incentive to invest into the monstrosities riding over the JVM (not calling names).<p>Also, screencasts are great because I read all day and its tiring, physically tiring. Sitting back, relaxing my eyes and being educated while I sip on a coffee and have a cookie is my idea of fun. Screencasts are free, bite sized, training. By the author's logic Khan Academy is worthless as an educational tool because most of it is written somewhere.",1294659793

2088141,comment,2086757,2088074,0,0,gjm11,,,"> but I find it fairly meaningless<p>Why? I don't find your hint helpful; I have a pretty good idea what an epistemological state is but no idea what an ""ethical state"" or ""aesthetical state"" would be.<p>The meaning seems perfectly clear to me: human nature, with all its cognitive biases and imperfections of memory and perception and limited thinking speed and imagination and so forth, makes it very unlikely that you will ever really be in the situation of having to choose between definitely-for-certain killing one person and definitely-for-certain letting one die, with definitely-for-certain no other options.<p>Now, that <i>isn't</i> (as jerf already pointed out) EY's actual argument, it's a hypothetical argument he put in someone's mouth and described as a dodge. He is, I think, endorsing something along the same lines:<p>It is unlikely that you will ever be in such a situation and, empirically, situations at all like that are very rare. So quite likely, <i>even if you think you are in such a situation</i> the probability that you actually are is low. On the other hand, you're extremely likely to encounter situations where you have the opportunity to harm people while convincing yourself you're doing good overall.<p>Accordingly, it may very well be that net expected utility is optimized by having you follow principles like ""the end justifies the means"". Even when it seems to you that you're in an exceptional case where you shouldn't. In other words, consequentialists should sometimes behave like deontologists.<p>But some hypothetical superintelligence (EY isn't AIUI talking about a perfected future hypothetical self, by the way) might well have a much better ability to tell what situation it's in and what options it has, and much less tendency to be corrupted and self-deceiving in the same ways as we are. If so, it would not be appropriate for it to operate on the principle that the ends don't justify the means -- at least, not if the <i>ultimate</i> goal is to maximize net expected utility. Consequentialist AI-designers might not do best to program their AIs to act like deontologists.<p>I have no idea what makes you think that EY's aim is to say ""look at me, I'm so clever""; for what it's worth, I find his argument clearer and less word-salad-y than yours. (Especially the weird paragraph about Jesus.)<p>And no, your purported summary is not accurate, for at least the following reasons: (1) EY didn't say anything about hypothetical future versions of himself, and (2) as jerf pointed out EY said in so many words that the ""I refuse to answer your question because I couldn't in that epistemological state"" response is ""a dodge"" and that one ought to have better answers to such questions. (Though he does think -- as AIUI you do too -- that this specific question may not deserve a more serious answer.)",1294659287

The idea that a fair society is one where inequalities are rather low is not exclusive to extreme left ideologies. How you articulate inequality and justice is one of the most pertinent way to describe right vs left ideologies, and economics do not preclude either view (up to a certain degree).<p>If you read serious works about how fairness and inequality relate in modern democracy (for example John Rawls), you will realize that the concept is certainly worth of consideration. Being of a normative nature, it is obviously a matter of personal judgement and opinion, but the idea that inequalities are mostly bad by nature cannot be dismissed as naive, stupid or both.<p>Finally, I have never seen any serious economic work which claim that inequality was necessary for an health economy. There is a lot of studies about policies which tried to decrease inequalities with disastrous consequences, of course, but that's different.",1294659126

ARM may be the best processor (whatever that means, as it's a design you license, not a piece of hardware) for looking at ads on a 3"" display, but I think Intel is still going to be relevant in the server market for a while.  Think about some of Intel's key assets like being really fast and having a C++ compiler that makes C++ even faster.  This is important because programmers write horrendous code that needs hardware assistance to produce answers in a reasonable amount of time.  (There are also problems to solve that require a lot of CPU power, like protein folding and finding the next Mersenne prime.  ARM processors are not used for this.)<p>Now, if you're saying, ""yeah, but not for desktops"", I can agree with you.

For example, in France (but I guess in other countries as well), children from teachers succeed much better than children from workers, even though income is not so much different. The ability to speak well, to dress well, manners, etc... matters a lot for getting high social status (through work, etc...), and they are valuable because of the inequality. If everybody has a certain quality, its value is almost zero, it is the same as resources in economy.<p>As for the origin of measured intelligence, I would be surprised about 50 % of intelligence which could be attributed to genetics if you mean IQ (I don't see how it would be consistent with the Flynn effect, for once).

2088106,comment,2087267,2087671,0,0,TimJYoung,,,"I would agree and disagree with you.  Looking at just wealth inequality is, as you say, asking the wrong question.  The real issue is earned wealth versus inherited wealth.  Even the founding fathers were particularly wary of the problem of allowing unearned wealth to aggregate over several generations, and how that can eventually allow incompetency to rule over competency.<p>And, this doesn't apply simply to the issue of taxing direct inheritances, so it's not so easy to solve with taxation alone.  Someone could easily not give their children a dime in direct inheritance, and just stick them high up in one of their companies with a nice, cushy multi-million dollar salary.",1294658109

2088102,comment,2087262,2087926,0,0,johnthedebs,,,"The reason deduplication won't help much with large mail archives is that it operates at the block level. In order to be effective, you need to have two copies of the same data that are <i>also</i> divided along the same block boundaries (the second part is arguably the bigger problem).<p>Also, many applications will already try avoiding duplicate data to varying degrees which makes dedup even less beneficial (backup utilities, VCSes, etc).<p>If you are dealing with a lot of text, though (like in a mail archive, or with lots of source code) compression really shines. It has way less memory overhead, pretty low CPU overhead, and it can significantly increase disk throughput.<p>You'll notice I was careful to say ""under many common workloads"" in my other post, it was because of all this. For most people, most of the time, there would just be no real benefit and a decent performance hit with dedup.<p>Edit: to clarify",1294657890

As this is the MVP at the moment I'll take your suggestions into consideration, so thank you I really do appreciate it.<p>In my eyes Google Spreadsheet is very generic, you could compare it to thousands of apps out there and argue that it is better. I'm really trying not to make another generic task manager, but one which is suited to teams working together in a multi-office environment.<p>To answer your question (if it is still required knowing my intentions a bit better), Google Spreadsheet requires you to sign up, it requires typing in fields such as a 'status' or a 'priority', it doesn't look as attractive, and it's always going to be branded as 'Google Docs'. Most importantly, it's not a task manager! Although it can solve a magnitude of problems, it's not exactly tailored to a specific one. Some would argue that it has more value, some would argue it has less.<p>I'm aware that this market is crowded, but I appreciate you believing I have a good start, and I really hope that the simple concept I'm trying to introduce will be noticed by a small fraction of the market out there who may find my product more suited to their business need than the product they are currently using.<p>Cheers!",1294657809

It provides a good gedanken for sorting out how much inequality results from age and how much results from other factors.<p>If you made this scenario a little bit more complex, you could demonstrate how other forms of ""inequality"" are based, in part, on age:<p>1: Have everyone start with equal $50,000 salary at age 22, then get a raise of $3,000 per year until they hit 65.  Everyone would still have equal lifetime earnings, but you would find significant income ""inequality"" when looking at the population as a whole.<p>2: Instead of a flat $3,000 per year raise, everyone gets a 3.5% raise each year until they hit 65.  This is closer to real life than the scenario above, and would produce an even more ""unequal"" income distribution.",1294657467

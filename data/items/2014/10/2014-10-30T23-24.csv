Kind of the opposite as advised before about why to start a startup. And even the numbers he shows are shady. He says there are only two ways to make money on consumer tech. Consumers paying you or advertising. That sums up to a total 170 billion dollars market. Note that he leaves Apple and all sort of consumer tech that is not ads or mobile apps purchases. And then he compares that with corporate IT market of 4.7 trillion dollars. But here he includes servers and all infrastructure.

I made it through till the last round for 4 companies (one that flew me from DC->SF) and didn&#x27;t get an offer from a single one. A couple of them I spent hours/days on coding projects/samples too, and 3/4 of them I really thought I had done well enough for an offer. I am still kind of recovering from it and haven&#x27;t entertained an interview opportunity in a couple months, and truthfully I didn&#x27;t cut a line of code outside of work for close to a month. I&#x27;m still slowly getting back into the swing of things, but I&#x27;m getting back into the swing of things. The sting of failure hurts, for damn sure; you try to separate your ego/self from the process and know that the interviewing process is a crapshoot, but it still gets to me and I imagine most people. Sounds like if you&#x27;ve made it that far and was even asked to interview with G and A, you&#x27;re going to be just fine down the road.

I don&#x27;t know if the file was even found on mr Svartholm&#x27;s computer.  The prosecutors just concluded that they couldn&#x27;t tell what happened with the datat that had been copied out from the system and therefore mr Svartholm probably did something evil with it.<p>So what&#x27;s in Schengen SIS?  It&#x27;s a list of personal details for more than 1 million(!!) people that are either wanted by participating states, under surveillance or people that just lost their passports or other identity documents.

8536464,comment,8534489,8536396,0,0,dezgeg,,,"> OOM in general cannot be used for remote code execution. heap overflow can.<p>That was <i>exactly</i> my point. Using reallocarray() instead of malloc(x * sizeof(foo)) can prevent a heap overflow bug. For a concrete example (assuming 32-bit size_t):<p><pre><code>    size_t user_input = ...;
    size_t* ptr = malloc(user_input * sizeof(size_t));
    if (!ptr)
        return &quot;FAIL: Out of memory&quot;;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < user_input; i++)
        ptr[i] = whatever();
</code></pre>
Now, a user_input of 2^30 + 1 overflows the multiplication so only 4 bytes is allocated, and then the for loop causes a heap overflow. Boom.<p>But if the code was this:<p><pre><code>    size_t user_input = ...;
    size_t* ptr = reallocarray(NULL, user_input, sizeof(size_t));
    if (!ptr)
        return &quot;FAIL: Out of memory&quot;;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < user_input; i++)
        ptr[i] = whatever();
</code></pre>
Now, a user_input of 2^30 + 1 would cause reallocarray() to return NULL, and the function returns. Heap overflow avoided by using reallocarray().<p>Of course, that code is still somewhat bad, since a user_input of 2^30 - 1 will cause the program to use large amounts for memory.",1414711799

It has caused quite a stir as all sorts of problems with CSC, the prosecutor and police investigation came to light during the hearings. Some highlights:<p>- CSC, that handles a large part of Danish infrastructure including social security numbers, police backend, etc. has dismal security. They don&#x27;t even update their software as security patches become available. Warg had access to their mainframe for 9 months without them having a clue about it. The only reason they found out was because the Swedish police called them and told them.<p>- username/password pairs for CSC&#x27;s server were readily available on one of their subsites(!)<p>- Warg turned off the logs on the CSC mainframe, and they didn&#x27;t notice. It appears that logs were turned off for months. As a result CSC doesn&#x27;t know whether data has been altered. We&#x27;re talking about all police systems, social security systems, and more.<p>- The police have not had their own investigative team at CSC, and haven&#x27;t looked at the technical evidence. This has been done by CSC, which is an obvious problem.<p>- The Danish police was contacted by Swedish police three times during 2012 because the evidence from a Swedish case turned up files from CSC, and the Danish police didn&#x27;t respond as they apparently didn&#x27;t find the information important. During the courtcase the Danish police&#x27;s chief IT investigator was caught lying about this.<p>- The prosecutor and judge were clueless, bordering on the hilarious, about technical issues. For instance the prosecutor refused to acknowledge that other user accounts except Wargs existed on the computer (there were 5 accounts), tried to paint putty as a hacking tool that only criminals would use, tried to establish Jacob Applebaum and Warg as friends because Applebaum retweeted one of Wargs tweets (only friends do that!), etc. etc.<p>These are just the highlights...",1414711604

Arguably, the value of that is largely in providing an assurance that dual parental legal responsibility will be assigned in the absence of any effort to establish (in rebuttable presumption jurisdictions) or independently of (in conclusive presumption jurisdictions) the facts of biological parentage, which is as valid in a same-sex partnership as in an opposite-sex partnership.",1414711288

It also has no geo-awareness, so if your propagation graph goes through sub-Saharan Africa you&#x27;re likely to see a lot of packet loss. I think my simulations implicitly assumed all high-end first-world broadband links, when reality includes the whole world and a lot of slow/crummy cellular.<p>(2) High latency, which caused problems for people who wanted low-latency multicast for SDN-type applications (enterprise stuff). In the beginning I never considered those applications, but they&#x27;re emerging as a major user base.<p>(3) Imposed a high CPU cost, since to prevent flooding every packet had to be cryptographically signed by its originating node. That&#x27;s a lot of ECC256 signatures and verifications.<p>(4) Mobile-unfriendly, since mobile devices really want to be able to enter long-term hibernation and not have to wake to help others propagate their multicasts. Mobile might even want to turn off most multicast, only allowing ARP and NDP or even emulating these for no multicast at all. (Currently working on iOS and Android ZT1 ports.) This also applies to tiny low power embedded devices, and I&#x27;ve had some interest from Internet-of-things experimenters.<p>There&#x27;s no write-up on the new algorithm yet, but it&#x27;s basically sender-side replication with lazy but deterministic gathering. It gathers recipients up to the limit from supernodes and from peers. (In reality supernodes <i>are</i> peers-- they&#x27;re merely peers designated as such.)<p>I remember initially passing on that idea since I was afraid it would be too heavy on the sender, but observing real traffic flows shows that <i>in aggregate</i> the multicast traffic load ends up close to the same. Sender-side replication is also inherently fair -- sender pays the price -- so you don&#x27;t need such heavy signature/verification checks to ensure that somebody can&#x27;t flood the network. This way it&#x27;s no easier to flood with multicast than with unicast. (Obviously anyone can DDOS but that&#x27;s another matter.)<p>In the longer term I plan to add some support for merging of multicasts going to the same local network or site, but I&#x27;m not sure how yet... it&#x27;s probably going to intersect with R&D work I&#x27;m doing right now on enterprise supernode federation for SDN applications and similar stuff.",1414710850

Do we press the bezel to confirm? Can the bezel be mounted as a rocker, for multiple inputs, like a volume key? Maybe. A glass or ceramic capacitive bezel, though, would really &quot;wow&quot; me!<p>I concede that I&#x27;d rather have a bezel input than Apple Watch&#x27;s crown input, which to me looked inconvenient, but seeing as the jury is still out on round vs. square design for these &quot;smartwatch&quot; UIs (a rotating bezel only works on round watches) it would be quite risky from a usability perspective.",1414710549
8536375,comment,8533427,8533892,0,0,fredophile,,,"There are a couple ways to do this. The easiest is to work with a good recruiting company. Lots of them suck but if you can find a good one it&#x27;s worth it. Ask people you know for recommendations. If you find a good recruiter they will be familiar with how long each company takes so they can do things like have you start interviewing at places that take longer first. Essentially, they&#x27;ll handle most of the timing issues for you. Having multiple offers puts you in a stronger negotiating position and they usually get paid a percentage of your starting salary so they want you to do well.<p>If you&#x27;re doing it on your own the key is to apply to several places and communicate a lot with each company&#x27;s internal recruiters. When you start interviewing ask what the whole process is and what the usual timeline is for each step. After each step send a brief thank you message. If they are slower getting back to you on the next step than you expected send a quick message to check on when you can expect to hear from them. As you&#x27;re going through the process at various companies some will progress faster than others. Make sure that the slower ones are aware you&#x27;re further along in interviews at other companies so they can catch up. When faster companies propose dates for the next step choose something in the longer end of the range to slow things down. Once you have your first offer inform the other companies you&#x27;re interested in that you have an offer and they need to start wrapping things up one way or the other.<p>Most companies can be flexible about their timelines. Even places that are known for long application processes can be significantly sped up if they know you&#x27;re on a deadline.",1414710531

8536369,comment,8534489,8536328,0,0,kazinator,,,"I just looked at some of my recent code where I&#x27;m using realloc. It&#x27;s obvious that this approach is insufficient, because it assumes there is only one multiplication. I have situations where an array is being resized. The size is expressed in terms of elements, rather than bytes. So two multiplications are going on: the size is increased first, and then in the realloc call, the argument expression has a multiplication by the element size also.<p>An overflow checking realloc won&#x27;t help if the first multiplication oveflows.<p>If I make this version instead:<p><pre><code>    void *realloc_array(void *old,
                        size_t existing_size,
                        size_t resize_factor,
                        size_t elsize);
</code></pre>
that&#x27;s no good either because I want the new size also if everything went well. I need something like:<p><pre><code>    void *realloc_array(void *old,
                        size_t existing_size,
                        size_t resize_factor,
                        size_t elsize,
                        size_t *p_newsize_out);
</code></pre>
Okay, now we&#x27;re talking. Resize my vector old, which contains existing_size elements, by a factor of resize_factor. The individual elements have size elsize. If all goes well (non-NULL is returned), give me the new size (in elements, not bytes) in the location *p_newsize_out.",1414710458

8536367,comment,8534082,8535757,0,0,taylanub,,,"It has no syntax (of its own) in that it hijacks s-expression syntax instead. When you want to write Lisp code, you actually write some data structures in the s-expression data format, like when writing some data in JSON or XML. Then a Lisp interpreter or compiler uses an s-expression parser to read that data structure into memory, and operates on that.<p>Then again, not just every Lisp dialect but even pretty much every implementation has its own s-expression parser with its own extensions to s-expression syntax to make it most convenient to write code in, so there&#x27;s not a very good decoupling after all. :-P Nevertheless it provides some benefits. Like being able to use something like &quot;paredit&quot; to edit code structurally, and making macro systems somewhat simpler (though hygienic macro systems cannot work with pure s-expression data; it must be annotated with lexical context).<p>You might find it hard to believe but I <i>love</i> Lisp syntax with all of its parentheses, and am explicitly against, for example, Sweet Expressions (SRFI-110). (Though SRFI-105 is fine.)<p>By the way another meaning of the word &quot;syntax&quot; actually refers to something within the data structures after the actual concrete syntax has been parsed away. For example when you have a list and its first element is the symbol &quot;if&quot;, then that list is a usage of the if syntax. This syntax takes three arguments (further elements of the list): a test, consequent, and alternative. So &quot;syntax&quot; is something like a function here, except it operates during compilation and its arguments are unevaluated sub-structures (roughly, code snippets, though the syntax could interpret them however it wants, like for example how the &quot;lambda&quot; syntax&#x27;s first argument is a parameter list). That&#x27;s why we can say &quot;in other languages you can only implement new functions; in Lisp you can also implement new syntax.&quot; (In the form of macros.)",1414710434

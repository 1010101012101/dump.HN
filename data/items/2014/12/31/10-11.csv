So they want to &quot;fix it&quot; by controlling what they can watch or do. They just can&#x27;t help themselves.<p>We need more decentralized surveillance and censorship-resistant systems. It seems to be the only way to stop this. &quot;Democracies&quot; don&#x27;t seem enough to stop this at the political level these days. It&#x27;s just too easy for the governments or parliaments to pass orders or laws such as these, and it&#x27;s much harder to mass mobilize against each one of them.",1420023594

That example is a DVD - presumably the hypothetical torrent would be high definition, probably worthwhile for a 2012 release. Now to be fair I could get the Bluray for £4.06 used. It&#x27;d be £6.62 if I wanted to watch it on Friday (of course I can&#x27;t get it delivered tomorrow even with Prime) so if I wanted to get near the convenience of Netflix I&#x27;m close to paying another month, for one film.<p>On another note about formats I have no way to watch a Bluray at home. I could buy an HDTV and Bluray player but I&#x27;d rather not. I&#x27;d also rather not be restricted to laptops that have disc drives when I shop for a new one in the future.<p>I won&#x27;t use the term restricting freedom, but I&#x27;m clearly losing options in the future if I buy that. Immediately I lose it being in HD unless I purchase new equipment and going forward I have to worry about what will inevitably be legacy formats.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to see why if I wanted to watch that film I might find the legal options lacking.",1420023522

He is not just looking to solve problems with the code and to port it to another more developer friendly ecosystem (although this sure will help in the long run), but what benefit / overall value he gets. You sure gotta add more value to the table. Try to analyze how much can he sustain / afford (in terms of time) to port the code to another developer friendly ecosystem. Or is his main priority is to add more features to the software product (If this is the case)? Because porting the code to another framework / language is more of an expense, while on the other hand adding more features / enhancing his product is more sort of a value addition.

Right now most companies prefer to spy on their employees, which makes them highly vulnerable to this type of leak in case of a hack.

And, maybe you&#x27;d still want a web app that is functional and lean. (As an example for two apps with non-identical possibilities, Google&#x27;s My Music allows you to change song metadata on desktop browsers but not in the Android app - yet another sign that My Music is meant as a desktop-y app).<p>In many cases it can be a sign of hubris or lazyness that you cannot get rid of the bloat.

My company works this way, my employees work remotely.<p>IMHO it is not hard or difficult per se, but you need to design your company around it, like with other things.<p>It is also an area that needs more study in order to develop fully.<p>Probably if I had a conventional company and I had to transform or convert it to remote, it wouldn&#x27;t work. There would be vested interest against the conversion on some people, some people would not believe it is not possible(people tend to believe that if you don&#x27;t look busy to others you are not working) or managers will fear their employees slacking.<p>When you create a company that makes money from day one remotely, you have not this problem, as you organize around it and it is not optional.<p>In some ways it is weird. If you go out of your house to get your children from school because you did not spend 1 hour commuting to work, 1 returning from it, society could believe you are not working at all.<p>They are often surprised to see you have money, and much more money than they have.<p>But I suppose it is not different from an old farmer watching people sitting in a chair in the city call it &quot;work&quot;.",1420020019

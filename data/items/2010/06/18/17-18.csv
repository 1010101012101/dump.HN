It ran for 70 days non-stop and was close to a break when I had to use the machine for something else.<p>Might also be not true, or the author did find the key but doesn't want to get into any legal trouble.<p>>If I can do that, pretty much anyone can. And those people will be able to forge mail from Facebook. Facebook has a simple solution, of course, just change the key length.<p>When that happens, Facebook changes the key, problem solved.<p>>The owner of a spam botnet could factor keys like that very quickly.

And unfortunately it's not possible to replace /usr/bin/python with 2.5 instead of 2.6 coz, Ubuntu seems to use python to check if a shell cmd exists. So I had to switch back to 2.6 after I had symlinked 2.5 at /usr/bin/python<p>Read an issue on the google code site where a lot of developers are requesting for python 2.6 support.

Still the trivial 1mb app limit.<p>Whatever happens, i still like appengine for it's ease of deployment of python apps.

Any portion of the tax code that mentions ""reasonableness"" is indeed open to interpretation. The interpretation of this code is (much like criminal law), based on judicial rulings; case law. In the case of a ""reasonable salary"", the following stipulations apply:<p>* The IRS will not force your corporation in to an unprofitable scenario as a result of the salary requirement; i.e., if your corporation is yielding a net loss, they will not force you to take salary, but then again, your tax issue is already solved if you have a NOL<p>* The reasonable salary clause is targeted and applied specifically to S-corp operators who take a disproportionately large amount of their income in the form of a distribution, rather than salary<p>There is potential for abuse with the existing tax code, but the reasonable salary requirement was created specifically to address that.

Some quick code movements result in this:\n  switch(attack) {\n      case MAGIC:\n          damage = magic_base_damage;\n          damage = account_surprise_attack(surprise, damage)\n          damage = reduce_damage_linear(damage, defense)\n      break;<p><pre><code>      case MELEE:\n          damage = melee_base_damage\n          damage = account_surprise_attack(surprise, damage)\n          damage = reduce_damage_fractional(damage, defense)\n      break;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nI'll leave out the functions, because they are a simple extract method from the function he gave. Once you notice this, and you are in an object oriented language, you can replace this type code with polymorphism and probably form a template method in order to remove the duplication in the general structure of damage calculation. In fact, at this point, I like the refactored solution more, because now it displays the underlying structure of the damage calculations (get base damage, add surprise bonus, apply damage reduction). [[Note: I wrote this while watching it. I arrived at the polymorphic solution after writing this, and at least in my opinion, my solution is pretty clear, opposed to his example. In my polymorphic solution, there is 3 times 1 call downward which returns 1 value upwards, which would be a nice simple W-shape.]]<p>I am not saying that his way has no advantage, and I don't want to bash it too much. I even kinda like it. I would just like to see examples which are harder to rip apart, because at least for me, the refactored damage calculation is pretty clear.<p>Later on, he brings that argument ""I can see everything in the table at once"". I really hate this argument. I really, really hate it. Yes, it is nice that I can look at these 3 or 4 values in this example. Yes, I can nicely see them on the screen. And now, I imagine something where we have like 20 - 30 different things. A good class hierachy just swallows this and it is simple to look at the relevant stack of classes. In a table, I need to look at ALL of them, resulting in a lot of horizontal scrolling.<p>Soo.. tl;dr?

It seems like the underdog startup culture is really internalized at Apple, all the way to the top.<p>I suspect one of the reason that firms led by their founder lead in their markets is that the founder has often spent a lot of time poor or cash strapped and is very careful about not wasting money.",1276880518

Jobs now have inflated value because most companies assume that everyone they employ or hire is above average, which is a mathematical impossibility.<p>That's just silly. Obviously not every company can beat ""average"", but if you are good at attracting and sizing up employees, then of course it's possible to put together a great team where everyone is beyond average. It gets harder the larger you get, but that's a long way from ""Mathematical impossibility"".",1276880494

Then you can self-attest (presumably at any time, such as when asked, but dont' quote me) compliance. You'll sign a  document that says:<p>* I read the PCI DSS (sorry).<p>* The above conditions about not handling cardholder data are true.<p>* (9.6) All paper and electronic media that contain cardholder data is physically secure.<p>* (9.7a) Strict control is maintained over internal and external distribution of any media containing cardholder information.<p>* (9.7b) Controls include (9.7.1) such media being ""classified"" so everyone knows its confidential and (9.7.2) when transported it's sent by courier or other trackable secure carrier.<p>* (9.8) Processes and procedures are in place to ensure management approval before moving any media containing cardholder data from a secure area.<p>* (9.9) Strict control is maintained over storage and access of media containing cardholder data.<p>* (9.10) Cardholder-carrying media is destroyed as soon as it is no longer need for legal or business reasons, and (9.10.1) hardcopy material is cross-cut shredded, incinerated, staked through the heart, chained in silver, buried under a full moon in a Scottish peat bog, and pulped so that cardholder data cannot be reconstructed.<p>* (12.8) Cardholder data once shared with service providers are secured with policies and procedures that:<p>* (12.8.1) Include keeping (yes wait for it) a <i>list</i> of service providers<p>* (12.8.2) You have written agreements with those providers that say ""yes we know what PCI means""<p>* (12.8.3) You have some due diligence process for choosing providers that know what PCI is.<p>* (12.8.4) You have a policy for monitoring those providers PCI compliance so if they suddenly decide PCI is a big joke you'll stop funnelling cards to them.<p>That's it. No app pentests required. No firewalls installed. More than half of it is about physical storage of cardholder records which you aren't doing because that's crazy.<p>I think you'll be fine.",1276880430

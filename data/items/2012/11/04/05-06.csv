4739086,comment,4738355,4738699,2,0,HCIdivision17,,,"And a competition with only one competitor is Solitaire.<p>Unfortunately, these types of large markets play continuous/repeating games, not one-shots.  Ideally, consumers wouldn't want to waste the time it takes for a monopoly to become complacent and be disrupted by a fresh competitor.  We can be fairly confident that if the market's inefficient (as it hopefully is in a monopoly), someone would certainly jump in and try to eat that inefficiency as profit for themselves and compete.  But that takes time.<p>Rather, we'd prefer the competition play out continuously.  There's overhead in time and wasted opportunity waiting for these games to restart, when we could have been incrementally improving the whole time (say, a lost product cycle or two: 18-36 months maybe?).  In this hypothetical ideal, the immediate cost to maintain this competition is higher to the consumer, but cumulatively lower in the long term since we gain though the innovation and efficiency forced by <i>active</i> competition.<p>Of course, we can certainly think of Solitaire as a one-person competion, but most companies don't have the wherewithal to <i>actively</i> compete against themselves (there are a few really awesome counter-examples, but they're at least partially awesome in light of how much everyone else fails to live up to that ideal).  It's much easier to cheat: take the short-term pay-off since no-one is available next round to punish.  Lacking alternatives, the consumer can't even properly punish the monopoly for cheating, and will instead have to either pay higher costs or accept passive innovation as the company coasts (or abstain, becoming a noncomsumer and shrinking the market - a worst-case scenario!).  Or worse, they drive their efficiencies enough that none may even afford to enter to compete, and since there won't be competition next round, the consumer faces all the same negatives <i>and</i> a much lower hope of competition-driven innovation/cost reduction for the round after that.  Now the best hope is a hidden competitor with the funds to jump in suddenly and without warning with a fully formed alternative (say, an iPhone perhaps); this happens rarely, and will likely take years to prepare.<p>TL;DR: When you're the only player, no one is there to stop you from cheating.  And the consumers are paying for the game.  That's why monopolies are lousy: consumers can't compete, but are still invested players - albeit disenfranchised.",1352008451

Or trolling us all?<p>Here is another ""race to the bottom is bad"" article, this time in the form of an ""editorial"" from Engadget. It's even more idiotic than usual.<p>The whole ""race to the bottom"" concept is odd to me: people complaining about how technology gets less outrageously expensive, and more available to everybody, and more commoditized.  Like that would be a bad thing? So the whole argument is fundamentally flawed to begin with - any time I see some pundit or CEO complaining about how the competition is making things cheaper, I go ""Uhhuh, crybaby"".<p>But when it comes to cellphones, it's not just a flawed argument, it's doubly stupid. Because in that market, particularly in the US, the alternative is the whole broken carrier subsidy model, with all that entails. None of which is good, and all of which is much worse than any (hypothetical) ""race to the bottom"" arguments.<p>And at no point did that deeply flawed editorial even mention carrier lock-in issues. What crock.<p>I have many reasons to like the google nexus phones: I just think that the plain android experience is generally cleaner than most of the skinned ones, and even when there is superior hardware (Samsung Galaxy SIII) I tend to prefer the Nexus model (honesty in advertizing: I've gotten free phones from both google and Samsung, but I actually bought my own Nexus One and Galaxy Nexus on google play store. And I installed CyanogenMod on the SIII Samsung gave me, because I wanted the JellyBean experience).<p>So I like the Nexus phones just because I think they have a nicer interface.<p>But I like the Nexus phones even more because they are clearly pushing the whole ""no carrier lock-in"" model.

By the end of the semester we had written the core guts of a multi-tasking OS, a couple shells and the display systems to handle even displaying things like a unix-like console, a sane piping system, all the major user land utilities (sans some of the compiler things, but things like ls, cat, ps, etc.) a simple text editor and intra-system messaging system, etc. etc. etc.<p>It was a great curriculum and really was the first time we, as CS students, had the chance to really spend time understanding the subject matter without spending time focusing on stupid language tricks like we had in our various C and C++. The code we wrote was fairly straight forward (we were learning the language as we went, so kept to the KISS method) and focused instead of the material. It was probably among the hardest, and best class I've ever had on any subject.<p>Did I know Java at the end of it?<p>To a point -- I knew the pidgin dialect we wrote the OS in. A few semesters later I took a fluff software engineering course and had to hack out some various java server bits and had a roughshod time of it as I ran head first into the now common overengineeringitis that plagues modern Java development. I found the syntax and most of the standard library familiar, but the idiomatic ways of writing the code, community practices, the <i>shibboleths</i>, nearly impenetrable without years buried in an enterprise software house.<p>I swore off Java and never looked back...moving on to Perl and Python for a spell (incidentally my standard ""learn a new language"" project is to write a simple non-lexical phrase extractor, it touches I/O, data structures, database connectivity, program flow, and if I get daring, multi-threading and a few other odds and ends and usually gives me a pretty good idea how a language works.<p>Now years later, taking a look at Android dev, I'm finding that writing code for the platform, <i>even though it's Java</i>, to be like writing code for our old OS. It's pretty simple, there's great library support, and I don't have to wrap simple method calls in hundreds of lines of framework boilerplate nonsense. It's actually pretty fun.<p>But I've definitely been drawing heavily on that pidgin dialect of Java that I learned way back when -- it's kinda like riding a bicycle, except a few bits have changed here and there. So yeah, I think I did ""learn"" the language, and it's been amazing how much of it I can recall since it's been a decade since I did <i>any</i> coding in it.<p>(this method also handily solves the ""I need a project, a goal, to learn the language, otherwise I'm just twiddling bits"" problem).",1352007079

Ie, you need to take the perspective of the firm as a composite of capital investment projects.  The aggregate value of the projects will be the value of the firm.<p>What impacts the decisionmaking of the firm? The spread between the cost of capital and the return on capital.  For a fixed opportunity set of projects, a lower cost of capital will result in <i>incremental</i> investment provided that capital is available and capital projects are available that exceed the cost of capital.<p>How does one get these projects?  In the real world, these are ""hunted"" like big game.  These projects are either invented by engineering (new widget X) or they are extensions of current product (widget Y) that are sold to new clients (Z) by sales or bus dev.<p>Internally, the ""green light"" for these hunting parties is a hurdle rate (set to an average expected return-average cost of capital=some threshold level).  Because there is uncertainty[2] in these big-game hunting expeditions, over time they will converge to the least amount of work necessary to clear the threshold. So, by this logic, the quality of projects will decrease over time as the threshold of project quality declines.<p>On the other hand, the external environment will also drive down this potential.  Other companies will be increasing their hunting parties, increasing competition and reducing the probability of success.<p>The combination of these two factors, will over time decrease the performance envelope of the hunter/gatherer parties (be they engineers or sales/bus-dev). The issue is that this decline may have persistent effects (ie, learning by doing cuts both ways.)<p>________________<p>[1] See my footnote earlier.

The article says right up front about the voting website that they had duplicated content on pages and no one linking to them to boot.  Both are known negatives to anyone working in SEO or web today and it has been known for years.<p>The entire article seemed to be one giant raving contradiction of its self.  Companies don't want to hire good people (or for some reason have ignored what they have said), chosen to keep doing things they way that keeps getting them negative results, then moan about it.  What happened to the voting website is the very thing thing that Bing would do to them (and probably has done to them).<p>Now admittedly, Google tends to promote its services above services of other companies, should they be in competing markets.  Its unclear if this is by accident (Google engineers probably know the best Google SEO methods after all) or by design.  At worst, if it is done by design, then Google is no worse then any other large company.  Remember when all the big super markets started producing their own products at cut rate prices?  Before when you walked into a Publix, you had 10ft of shelf space devoted to nationally branded ranch dressing.  Now you have 5 ft devoted to Publix brand Ranch dressing and 5ft devoted to everything else.  So if you are Kraft, your seeing your [eye-ball] search traffic being reduced by half and your competitor now has a much lower price to boot.<p>Why is it that Kraft doesn't care about that?  They don't care, because they have spent the last half decade building their brand and their customer pool.  They know that if their loyal customers go into a super market they will see the cheaper supermarket branded ranch dressing first; then second they will see the high priced Kraft and buy Kraft.  I can easily extend this analogy to many of the situations presented in the article.  When Google enters a market, they are the underdog.  Just like when Publix decides to copy another nationally branded product and sell it in their stores.  Even if Publix devoted 9 ft to Publix brand Ranch and 1 ft to National brands, on the shelves, Publix still wouldn't capture 90% of the market.",1352006200

Someone who searches for ""kitchen table"" is looking for a website selling or providing information about kitchen tables, not a search engine that allows them to search for websites selling or providing information about kitchen tables. The user is already <i>on</i> a search engine -- other search engines are not relevant search results unless the search term is in the nature of ""XYZ search engine.""<p>What the complainers are doing is the equivalent of going into the largest chain of retail stores and putting boxes on the shelves labeled with a brand that the major retailer doesn't carry, which don't actually contain any product but instead contain a map to other stores that carry the brand the retailer doesn't. And then complaining when the retailer doesn't allow the spam products to remain on their shelves, and claiming it's an antitrust violation because the retailer has the most market share and it sells its own competing brands of products.<p>Naturally that doesn't convince judges or sell newspapers, so the spammers scour the world for instances of algorithmic imperfection that give a bad ranking to someone <i>else</i>, who unlike the spammers didn't actually deserve it, and then play ominous music as they reveal the shocking fact that some Google engineer's 20% project or some little-known subsidiary responsible for 0.00043% of corporate revenue arguably competes with the disadvantaged website in some fashion.",1352006023

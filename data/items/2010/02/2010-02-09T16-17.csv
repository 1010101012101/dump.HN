1112599,comment,1112111,1112234,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>People have 200+ friends on their friends lists but only a handful of those are meaningful</i><p>What I have found, by making most of my Facebook behavior submitting links for comment (a la participation on HN), is that many more of my friends have become more meaningful as they interact with one another based on the only commonality they have--that they are all my friends. People who have never met one another even once get into great conversations on my Facebook link threads, and I learn a lot from them by lurking in the discussions. Eventually, I gain a bigger, more cohesive social network that way, including people all over the world who are talking about the day they have a ""cocktail party"" with me while enjoying serious conversation on thought-provoking issues. The value of the graph is all in how you use the graph.<p><i>Why is this kind of data ever going to be useful?</i><p>Accurately gathered data are almost always useful.

1112596,comment,1111677,1112572,0,0,barrkel,,,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""atomic"".<p>In a multithreaded world, synchronous code storing its state on the stack, and asynchronous code derived from a CPS transform of direct style (thus storing its state in continuations), seem equivalent for the purposes of ""atomicity""; since the OS scheduler can come in and reschedule the synchronous thread at any point (and will definitely context switch if the thread blocks), it seems no different to the CPS transformed case (OS may choose to context switch at any time).<p>Things like mutex locks do work differently in the CPS case, but it's rather that they are asynchronous too: blocking on a mutex means handing the continuation off to the mutex to continue when it's available to be acquired. And things like thread-local storage work differently - the logical thread of control may change physical threads in the CPS async case, but a runtime or compiler (which will be aware of the CPS transformation) can abstract this away.<p>So, what do you mean by ""atomic""?",1265734694
1112595,comment,1111098,1112574,0,0,Tichy,,,"No, it is not a coincidence that Java and XML go hand in hand. Heavy XML usage was introduced into common Java practice to compensate for the lack of dynamic features in Java. So dynamic features were introduced (badly) through the XML backdoor. Also often XML is used as a poor mans DSL.<p>It could have been something similar to XML (like JSON or YAML), but that is not the point. Also, the verbosity of XML aligns itself well with the Java mindset.",1265734650

For example, when anyone asks me for exercise advice, I tell him:  ""Do 1 push-up every day right before you take a shower.""<p>That may sound pathetic but the key is to do something consistently every day.  So if you're in a hurry and don't feel like exercising, drop and do one push-up anyway.<p>Eventually those efforts compound, and soon enough you're doing <i>your age</i> in push-ups every day.  But if a day comes when you don't feel like doing your age in push-ups, just do one.  Don't do zero just because you can't meet your loftier goal.",1265734411

There's no reason why the in-memory db can't advertise itself as non-atomic, in which case changing to the network communication shouldn't break anything.  Similarly, the network DB can operate synchronously and hold control of the program counter during the entire operation.<p>Saying that all functions are non-atomic is certainly a reasonable policy, and one that is used in many situations.  Personally, I find it more convenient to program in an environment that does have this distinction.  Apparently, your tastes are different than mine.",1265734188

The actual piece was quite interesting (not that a piece about a box of Joel wouldn't be, I suppose), and contrasting that with my expectations made me realize just how well-branded certain names become within their particular niches.<p>Consider, for instance, that for different groups, ""PG"" most likely means a company (Procter & Gamble), a movie rating, or some other industry-specific thing.<p>Obviously this isn't a particularly novel realization; perhaps it's even an ""outsight"" [1].

Also, it doesn't have any proprietary specific ""extensions"" and bugs are fixed ASAP.

Nobody questioned whether people would want a smartphone at all, they'd been popular for years, just where in the market the iPhone would end up.<p>The iPad's a different animal because it's trying to sell people something they don't even know they want. It's more akin to the Apple TV than the iPod.

Eat breakfast every day, and make sure it has protein.
2.  Eat only whole grains and no refined flour, pasta, and avoid simple carbs.
3.  Eat plenty of fats, including nuts, avocadoes, olive oil, and other healthy fats.<p>I've done all of this while eating filling breakfast, lunch, and dinner, along with snacks in between meals and even dessert like chocolate brownies, dark chocolate, etc.<p>Not only have I lost 20 pounds, I can eat this diet for the rest of my life and be completely healthy.  This is the diet that humans evolved on, whole grains, fresh vegetables, fruits, and lean meats.  The diet is very similar to Mediterranean or Asian diets.<p>Some other benefits, since I switched to this diet, I have more energy, my cholesterol is perfect, and my blood sugar levels don't spike.<p>The entire secret to this diet is that by eating whole grains and avoiding simple carbs, you avoid foods that turn into sugar in the blood and cause your blood sugar to spike.  These foods like breads/pastas/etc give you quick energy, but then cause a crash later, causing you to eat even more food.  Also, your body can't deal with that much sugar in the blood so it stores it as fat.  By eating whole grains, your body takes longer to digest them, releasing blood sugar at a slow, even rate.  Thus, you have energy all day and don't crash, or get hungry between meals.<p>edit:  I also want to point out that the author of the book has done considerable scientific medical research, and his diet is based on empirical research, not pseudo-science like many diets.",1265732518

How much would that change? How many students are actually only a few years off? Is 5 years reasonable or should they be allowed to be 7 years off? What about the situation where a set of events are closer in time than your deviation?<p>2) One from generalization: if you have to know it was half a century after the reformation, you still know nothing if you don't know the reformation started in 1540 (I'm making this year up; it depends much on the country). Which still doesn't mean a thing if you don't know Michaelangelo died in 1480 (still making stuff up), which is 400 years after the Dark Ages started (...). Do you think they should know whether Raphael and Thomas of Aquinas lived in the same times? Should they know whether the Austrian-Hungarian empire existed already when Newton invented gravitation? The more facts you start relating, the more important precision becomes. The more you want to describe detailed chains of events, in which the details matter, the more facts you need to relate.",1265731575

This is not to say that they are requirements for achievement.  They simply improve your odds of getting ""lucky"" at some future point in time.<p>That said, I shouldn't downplay the importance of the education aspect.

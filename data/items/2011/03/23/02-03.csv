But, <i>almost all the safety mechanisms were breached</i>.\nWith slightly more misfortune (perhaps another hydrogen explosion), much radiation could have been released, and many could have died.<p>Anyone (like Monbiot, the author) who argues that this incident increases faith in the safety of the nuclear power plant needs to read Feynman's minority report on the shuttle disaster.<p>When the safety systems, designed never to be breached at all, are 50% breached, you do <i>not</i> have a 50% margin of error.\n<i>You have an extremely serious problem.</i><p>Is nuclear fisson probably going to be our medium term energy source?  Yes; there are few better alternatives.\nBut we are going to have to be very careful about how we build them.<p>Finally, while I am not attacking nuclear power here, it is erroneous to reason about the relative safeties of technologies based purely on the historical track record.<p>What we should be thinking about is what the risk is in future; not what it has been in the past.  If I told you I had an energy source that had a known 0.01% of ending the world, each year, but a clean 50 year track record, would you allow me to continue with it?\nOf course not!<p>We must not make inferences about possible risks based purely on the track record, with no regard for improbable, but perhaps catastrophic, scenarios.<p>Thankfully, nuclear power is not the doomsday energy source some people make out; and I'm not arguing against it - just against the specious reasoning.",1300849071

2357715,comment,2357437,2357595,0,0,jbm,,,"Nuclear power is clearly unsafe, it's just a question of whether or not it is more unsafe than the other alternatives.  This accident doesn't need to prove that, the fact was apparent the first time someone lit a match.<p>However, Nuclear Power does have a special need to prove its case in the aftermath of this incident.  Just look at the economic damage from the Fukushima issue.  Other than the flight of foreigners out of Tokyo (fear + uncertainty is inevitable with the notoriously closed Japanese nuclear industry), there are issues with farming in Japan's third or fourth largest farming area, medium-term damage to energy output (""All eggs in one basket""), damage to businesses in Tokyo & environs (Rotating power outages, etc..).  Summer in Tokyo will be HELL without air conditioners.<p>I think It's pretty obvious Japan needs nuclear power.  A future without 20% of Japan's energy sources is a non-starter.  I'm sure the power-downs & practical alternatives (fossil fuels) will show that decisively.<p>However, putting so much generating capacity in one location in an earthquake & tsunami prone country is a mistake.  Maybe mini-nuclear plants are what we need going forward.  Maybe we need less nuclear and more renewable power.  Maybe something else.<p>However, what we don't need is people outside of Japan using this life-and-death situation to promote energy politics, be it green, nuclear or otherwise. The geographical & historical context is completely different. (Ontario will never be hit with giant 8 meter Tsunamis after a 9.0 earthquake.)",1300848423

It would be equally difficult, time consuming and expensive for business owners to locate and negotiate with all the owners of the music that might be used. There is a simple, fast and reasonably priced alternative. Through ASCAP, in one simple transaction, businesses can obtain the right to perform the millions of songs created or owned by more than 400,000 of America's and hundreds of thousands of the world's best songwriters, composers, lyricists and publishers. Founded in 1914, and still owned by and managed for its writer and publisher members, ASCAP grants businesses the permission they need to perform music publicly. The money collected is distributed, after deducting operating costs (currently 11.3%), directly to ASCAP members and to affiliated foreign performing rights organizations for their members.

This is an attractive idea, because it's true that there is a lot of demand for this sort of thing, and most of it is pretty generic. It has potential.<p>But...'movie studio as a service' is a terrifying prospect, because there are a ton of people out there with scripts and a ton of people out there with cameras, and a tagline like that is guaranteed to attract the very worst of both groups. Same thing with the domain name - 'cine' puts people's brains into art mode, and when people are disappointed they often blame their tools. This is the sort of hump that besets products like MovieStorm and XtraNormal.<p>I am overstating it a bit to give you the pessimistic angle, but after about a decade of working in indie film and video doing everything from narrative to commercials, it's very hard to work around the inevitable quality problems in the post pipeline - the worse the input material, the less realistic the expectations of the customers about the ability to 'fix it in post' may be. The people who can shoot quality video don't really need a product like this, and the people who really need a product like that may be the trickiest customers to deal with.

The entire rationale behind the ""Opt-Out"" approach was _the only people who cared_ would be the ones most capable and likely to opt out.  The 99% of abandoned or orphaned works that have nobody to speak to, or nobody to find - would automatically return to the public domain where they belong.<p>For those Naysayers - how do you propose we prevent losing all those orphaned works to decay, and, just as importantly, make them accessible to the entire world - that's what Google was offering.  In an ideal world, we'd have a sane copyright system which would terminate author's copyrights after some reasonable period of time unless they (or their estate) renewed their copy rights.   That way, give an author, say, 20 years of exclusive rights, renewable for up to 40 more years (in 20 year increments) or 20 after their death, whichever is longer.<p>In that world - You could copy all the books, and, when the ISBN indicated it's copyright was expired - it would become searchable.<p>That _certainly_ will inspire authors to create new works - An author creating a material would be guaranteed income for them and their estate for a minimum of 60 years (presuming they die the very next day), or potentially more than 100 years - but, at the same time, means that works return to the public domain once nobody cares, creating a richer creative commons.<p>The problem with _this_ world is that copyrights continue for insane periods of time because a few content owners (of the hundreds of thousands who have created content) - have successfully lobbied for stretching out the copyright windows on ALL WORKS - not just the ones that people care about and are extracting economic value from, without thinking of the negative impacts on the creative commons.  Thanks Disney.  (Ironically one who very effectively mines the creative commons for their own works)<p>Remember, the purpose of copyrights and patents is not to create some monopolistic/locked-in intellectual property blackhole, rather, in the United States at least, it is ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.""<p>Emphasis on ""promote the progress"" and ""securing for limited time""<p>Hopefully today's decision was a not big step backwards - in an ideal world, this settlement is modified such that it's available to all content archivers/searchers, such that they will have access to the same terms as Google, and we'll be able to truly ""Promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts.""",1300845902

If you had one but not the other, which would you choose? If you have only the library, you can probably figure out how to use some parts. If you have only docs, you have <i>nothing</i> working at all.<p>The point of course is: documentation is important. Almost certainly very true. Though it now seems rather mundane.

890131,comment,889928,890055,0,0,cschneid,,,"I agree with the grandparent post.  We need to define why college exists in the modern system.<p>In the more distant past, it was purely academic.  Research, experimentation, etc. Somewhere in the last century the goal of schools shifted to be an unfocused trade school.  ""Learn to write well, every job needs that!"".<p>I'm not opposed to either approach, and believe that both need to exist in the world.  But the idea of a 4 year college falls awkwardly in between those two ideas.<p>I think the reason we are in this situation is because we confused cause and effect.  Back when college was a much more limited institution, the smartest and best connected went to school. They then got the best jobs, and earned more money.  People saw that and said ""Aha! College leads to better jobs"".  What they missed was the ""Aha! Smart people get the best jobs!"".  So the push to get everybody into college started, since it would guarantee the student's financial future.  That of course hasn't been sustainable, and it has ruined the bachelor's degree as a useful resume signal that you are part of that top tier of people.<p>We need to reevaluate how important exclusivity is to universities, reevaluate how kids can be trained for high end jobs (can you do a trade school for computer programming?).  It may be as simple as a marketing campaign saying that plumbers and mechanics can't be outsourced and make a ton of money.",1255963274

The worst programmers we've hired have the largest programming book collections.<p>Perhaps I'm in an odd part of the industry.

Our best hires have been those who've had to write a lot of software in the pursuit of some unrelated degree.""<p>--above comment by mpbk on original article page<p>I hate to see comments like this.  Partially because I'm a book rat and partially because I have a CS degree.  I speculate that it reflects experience with hiring people who picked up a CS degree from an average program simply when it was a ""hot"" degree rather than actually being interested in software development.<p>Don't great hackers like to read about hacking as well as actually hacking?  I go through periods of struggling through tech books followed by attempting to apply what I've just read in working code.<p>Re: the no-hire function of being able to talk about one of the people interviewed in the book:  Everybody wants to have the ""one filter to sort them"" interview question for candidates.  Guess what.  It ain't that easy.  You want to bring on only great candidates?  You need to look at several things.  I would argue that one really good filter is the examination of previously produced code by a candidate by more than one person on your team and then, horrors, a discussion of that code during an actual face-to-face interview with the candidate.<p>Atwood is probably exaggerating a bit in his no-hire flag comment, but a PHB out on the net is going to read this, pick one of the names at random, and spit it out at a candidate sometime soon.

However, I feel it doesn't actually incentivize them to graduate unless they're already driven to do so.<p>@yummyfajitas, tokenadult, It would definitely be interesting to graduate in three years, but I think the better option is to regear the fourth year as a transition year, with few classes and geared towards internships, externships, coops, and on-campus research.

If the documentation is missing, someone can and eventually will write it. And <i>anyone</i> can write documentation, just like anyone can write a library. No committees. No endless blog posts debating how the fourth paragraph's third word should be capitalized.<p>But fundamental language features simply cannot be bolted on. Even if they fit with the language's philosophy and implementation, it is a tremendous investment to get a new feature added to a language.<p>Some languages do not admit new features easily. Type erasure, anyone? Some cultures do not admit new features easily. Closures, anyone? Both are examples of places where Java couldn't or wouldn't add features cleanly.<p>There is no such issue with documentation. Anyone can document something, and everyone should. You don't need to make it official, either. Blog about a feature or library, and thanks to Google your blog post becomes an ipso facto part of the library's documentation.<p>For my money, the measure of a library's documentation is whether I can type the name of a library into Google and find the answer to my questions on the top half of the first page.",1255961545

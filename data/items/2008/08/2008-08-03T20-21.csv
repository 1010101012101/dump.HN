One time in high school I was working on an advanced calculus problem for several hours before going to sleep.

The problem was to find the solution to \int_{0}^{\infty} t^{- \frac{1}{2}} e^{-t} dt.<p>If only this worked all the time.

265706,comment,265121,265553,0,0,thwarted,,,"Except that without scope inheritance, the ""closures"" created with create_function are kind of useless, and since functions are created in the global scope and thus are not garbage collected, creating new ones each time it is called ends up eating a lot of memory.  This makes create_function largely useless, I don't know anyone who uses it; it's often better to just define the function globally yourself anyway and avoid the cost of run-time parser invocation, which is the same cost as using eval.  In fact, create_function is implemented in terms of eval.<p>So you get a bunch of drawbacks and none of the real benefits, plus misrepresentation in the documentation.<p>Which necessitates this patch, which includes syntax changes, of course.  This can only, ahem, be better.",1217794538

I'm willing to work long hours and be paid less than a 1/N share of the company's income, while the ""elders"" are paid more than 1/N. They have more experience than I do, and the differential in pay is my paying a mentorship fee in order to learn from them at work.

The problem is the lack of rainfall combined with increases in population and water requirements as a result.<p>In fact, we're so water conscious now that there is legislation in place, in the form of water restrictions, to help limit unnecessary water usage.<p>EDIT - just thought I'd break down some numbers to show why this is a good thing for us.<p>Household water usage in Australia is just over 11% of the total water usage, the second highest use in Australia behind Agriculture.<p>I'm not sure on our specific percentages of washing usage to normal usage, but if we assume that the 13% figure is fairly consistent with the UK (given relatively similar cultural backgrounds) then our washing machines account for about 1.4% of all total water usage in Australia.<p>Being able to cut this down significantly is good news, when you consider water usage (for us anyway) is measured in gigalitres (potentially saving up to 268 GL a year) - thats a whole heap of h2o",1217794183

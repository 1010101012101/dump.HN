These &quot;amazon is so expensive and so slow&quot; posts show up here constantly, and every time I try to get information on alternatives, and nobody has anything.  A single dedicated server running in some warehouse is not a replacement for AWS.  I need S3, or I need a bunch of storage devices in multiple datacenters automatically keeping the files I put on them synced.  Which hosting provider is doing that again?  Where is my EBS with a dedicated server warehouse?  I need block device that is durable, and can be quickly and easily detached from one server and attached to another.  Even the cheapest redundant iSCSI SAN setup is very expensive.<p>I am not paying for AWS because I am dumb, I am paying for AWS because they provide services that allow me to outsource the high durability to them.  Someone show me an actual alternative please, rather than just repeating &quot;zomghosting.biz gives you a million gigs for $20!!1&quot;.",1373475583

6021079,comment,6020846,6020846,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"10x is about more than just the person. Skill, experience, and project/person fit also matter. I&#x27;m a bona fide 10xer but I&#x27;m not going to be &quot;10x&quot; under every possible context. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a Ruby shop and you hire me (I&#x27;ve never used Ruby). Now, I&#x27;ve used Clojure, Python, and a little bit of Node. So I&#x27;ll pick Ruby up quickly, and probably be very good within a couple of months. But you&#x27;re not going to be happy if I&#x27;m working 4 hours per week during that on-boarding process and using 10x as an excuse. A two-month onboarding period is acceptable; 20 months is not.<p>Like a &quot;ten-year overnight success&quot;, 10x requires a lot of skill and investment to get there, and the vast majority of people do not (and can not) get there on a 4-hour work week. It might be that only ~4 hours are critical to learning, but there&#x27;s a whole search process involved in finding what is worth learning and how to learn it. You have to work a lot harder to get to the point where you&#x27;re a legit 10xer. This is the proverbial &quot;10,000 hours&quot;-- there&#x27;s a lot of variation by individuals and projects, but no doubt in my mind that that&#x27;s the right order of magnitude.<p>Full-time employment is becoming a dinosaur, over time, and even more clunky is the expectation of full loyalty (no side projects, no competing interests, minimal support for education) that employers tend to expect. So I&#x27;m not taking the other side, so much as I think it&#x27;s unreasonable to make the argument that 10x can be divorced from the very hard work it takes to get (and stay) there.<p>I would argue in favor of compensating 10xers better (5x instead of 1.2x) or giving them <i>a lot</i> more autonomy (so they can continue investing in their skills, but aren&#x27;t expected to invest more than 4 hours into <i>assigned</i> work) but at that point, you&#x27;re talking about sociological issues-- why aren&#x27;t the best people rewarded or even recognized?-- and that&#x27;s a different can of mud.",1373475525

This meant that the wholesale price for e-books would equal the wholesale price for physical books, and as a result, the wholesale price that Amazon paid for an e-book would be set at several dollars above Amazons $9.99 price point.

If it should reappear, please forgive the double-posting.<p>> The FISA process concerns surveillance of foreign nationals who enjoy extremely limited constitutional protections.<p>It&#x27;s unclear, from the public&#x27;s perspective, that FISA warrants are only being directed against foreign entities.<p>> People are fond of pointing out that the government rarely loses at FISA hearings. But as it turns out, of course, the government also rarely loses when it files for domestic wiretap authority. Relative to other transactions investigators and prosecutors have with the courts, the process of obtaining authority to wiretap is extraordinarily difficult; prosecutors don&#x27;t waste time doing wiretap paperwork if they&#x27;re not sure the request will be granted.
Two different processes, neither of them adversarial, both of them secret, both of which produce an authority to surveil people. My question: why would the process that surveils foreigners without Fourth Amendment rights require a devil&#x27;s advocate, when the domestic wiretap process has no such mechanism?<p>I hate to keeping beating this horse. But the argument that domestic warrants are equally non-adversarial keeps coming up. So I guess the horse isn&#x27;t dead. Domestic warrants <i>are</i> part of an adversarial process, if only after the fact. They are typically used to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution. When that happens, the defendant has a right to challenge the warrant. This serves as a counterbalance. Judges, prosecutors, and police know that a bad warrant will likely be thrown out if the criminal case is brought to trial. Thus, they have a very real incentive to write good, defensible warrants. This means it&#x27;s to their advantage to keep their warrants narrow in scope. And thus the goal of preserving privacy is served.<p>> I ask in part because I think synthesizing an adversary is unlikely to create a meaningful restraint; a synthetic adversary doesn&#x27;t have the same incentives as a real one.<p>Do you mean that there aren&#x27;t incentives for the opponent of the warrant, or for the government?<p>If the former, I can only point out that organizations like the ACLU can be quite zealous. I would much prefer advocacy by the ACLU than no advocacy at all.<p>If the latter, the restraint would take two forms. First, judges and investigators would be aware that overbroad or otherwise improper warrants can be undone. This would incentivize writing good warrants. Second, the warranted surveillance could be halted upon a successful challenge, assuming said surveillance is ongoing. Both of these are meaningful checks.",1373475187

(I would say it&#x27;s the only laptop I own, but my apartment is a veritable computer museum and several of the specimens are laptops.)<p>For me, the biggest problem with laptops is keeping them sync&#x27;d with my desktop.  I could use a laptop as a primary computer, and with better expansion options than previously exited (USB3, dual Display Ports, etc.), but I still find laptops limiting, meaning I only use them when I can&#x27;t have my desktop.  My desktop has 6 cores, 4 drives, a high-quality sound card, a real serial port, etc.  These things are all important for what I use a computer for, most of the time, and a laptop just isn&#x27;t good enough to be my only machine.<p>Chrome OS solves the synchronization problem for me.  The configurability is restricted more than my average Linux box, so there is less to concern myself about setting up.  My browser settings and extension sync, the desktop background syncs, etc.  I can take a brand new Chromebook and be up in running in 5 minutes.<p>That&#x27;s the value proposition of Chrome OS for me.  Once it is up and running, I can ssh to a real computer and browse the web, which is what I&#x27;d do with a ultra-excellent billion-core superlaptop 99% of the time anyway.<p>The other 1% of the time, I&#x27;d like to use a laptop for portable software-defined radio applications, and as it stands, Chrome OS is terrible for that.  But since Chrome has APIs for talking to USB, serial ports, and audio, I&#x27;m actually working on supporting controlling my radio and analyzing the I/Q inputs as a Chrome packaged app.  The advantage for me is that I&#x27;ll have SDR functionality on any computer I encounter: you can install packaged apps from the webstore on Chrome OS, Mac, Windows, and Linux, and everything will Just Work.<p>Finally, the Pixel has the best screen I&#x27;ve ever seen on a computer.<p>Anyway, Chrome OS is nowhere near its full potential just with the APIs available today.  I think as more developers write awesome web apps or Chrome apps, more people will use Chrome OS, further incentivizing developers to create even better non-desktop apps.  But as it stands, I am 100% satisfied with the Pixel as my primary laptop, and I imagine many other people are too.",1373473544

It became even more well known in 1982, when Don Lancaster wrote a book entitled <i>Enhancing your Apple II</i>.  In it was a chapter on &quot;Tearing into Machine-Language Code,&quot; in which he explained a method for using a disassembly printout and colored highlighters to quickly reverse-engineer machine code.  This method soon spread beyond the Apple II community.  For example, from a 1983 book review in <i>Microcomputing Magazine</i>:<p><pre><code>    Software buffs are likely to vote for the 
    third chapter (&quot;Tearing Into Machine- 
    Language Code&quot;) as the jewel of the 
    collection. It is a unique contribution that 
    applies to all machine languages, of 
    which Apple is only one. Possibly no 
    manual anywhere that describes the use 
    of disassemblers and techniques for ex- 
    tracting hidden code can equal this 
    60-page adventure in decryption. Pro- 
    grammers would do well to look into this 
    chapter to check on techniques they 
    might have missed; commercial software 
    vendors may want to know some things 
    that hackers do to defeat them.

I had learned a lot of cool stuff in college, like distributed systems, that was completely useless to what I did. The problem was, when I transitioned to management, all my proactivity and passion for strategy were also almost useless; you were expected to do as everyone else, or else. So I quit :)<p>Right now, working on my startup, I get ticked off for a lot of menial work that it involves, but despite being tired and broke, I&#x27;m way happier.

I have a BMX-style bike, so no problem for me...the bumps are fun.<p>Another point is, even if it&#x27;s a nice sidewalk, you generally can&#x27;t go as fast as the road because of the danger of running into pedestrians and other random obstacles like fire hydrants, telephone poles, etc.<p>Yet another point, is that I hear very frequently that it&#x27;s statistically safer to ride on the street.

I bought Sparrow a few months ago based on the understanding that Push would be coming in a future update.

He found references to non-free software in the ports tree and wrote to the openbsd mailing list to ask for clarifications.
There were actually a few saner voices who politely stated that was the intent and that OpenBSD as a project had a different definition of ""free"" and as such should not be included in the officially endorsed FSF-list.<p>Of course, for the less stable elements, it was a good pretext to scoff and insult the the man.

You don't need to bother measuring the double decker bus because you know that it's around 100 times as large as needed. You don't need to consider using the motorcycle because that is clearly far too small.

3971005,comment,3970118,3970118,0,0,henri,,,"@MehdiEG<p>1 - There are two main reasons why listings are kept online even if they are already taken. Firstly, agencies purposely keep listings on so that they can occupy a slightly larger search percentage on property sites. I believe by law they can continue advertising a property for a further two weeks after being taken.<p>The second reason is that when you look at the supply chain of how listings get onto a property site - you can see why listings are often already taken, especially in highly populated areas such as London. An agent has their own website to manage - you can bet they update it with new listings daily but do they remove old listings at the same time? Those listings are then pushed to property portals via the software provider in a feed. Usually it will take at least 24 hours until those listings go live on the property portal, which in many cases may already be too late.<p>2 - In the UK, if you rent through an agency you should expect to pay extra on top. Usually the agency fee covers things like credit/reference checks and prevents time wasters. Imagine if there were no fees and I called up three agencies and told them I wanted to take each property. Then all three removed the listings from their site/property portal - I'm only going to take one property, so two agencies would have their time wasted, maybe all three if I decided I didn't want any of them.<p>Whilst it is annoying for us to call up for a listing that is advertised as available only to find it has already been taken, I think if we look from both sides it becomes more apparent why it happens. In terms of the ""extra"" costs, it all boils down to data quality. Even if the option was available for agents to indicate their ""extra"" costs, I can guarantee most would not use it. If they were forced to use it, most would provide inaccurate data.<p>My advice to you, is find a property website that you like searching on. The quality of data (as in the listings) all boils down to the source, the agencies, and nothing can be done about it. The only thing property sites can do is to ensure they keep their site as up to date as possible from the feeds (sometimes low quality) they receive.",1337003003

So you'd think about doing something like this:<p>interface Map {

 static defaultImpl() {

 }
}<p>Except, interfaces can't have implementation in them. That would imply multiple inheritance (which languages like Dart and Java don't support).<p>Okay, so one workaround: use an abstract class:<p>abstract class Map {

 static defaultImpl() {

I originally purchased my system when they were InGrid about 6 years ago.<p>When I bought my system, it was advertised that the system would work with or without monitoring, which was a huge selling point for me. I wasn't sure if I really cared about the monitoring or not, since alerts go directly to your phone, email, etc. With those kinds of alerts, who needs someone else to call the cops for you?<p>Anyway, so I invested in the system mostly for this reason. The InGrid site was great and the support staff was friendly and helpful - I always ended up talking to the same person and it was a nice experience. So I dumped a good $600 into sensors, cameras, etc.<p>Fast-forward a few years and InGrid changes their name to LifeShield - I don't know if this was an acquisition or a brand change or what, but it brought on a slew of bad experiences. The support staff started sounding cold and uninterested. The website started going to shit, it was impossible to find things (try finding the online control panel to your system - that thing has changed URLs / names at least 5 times).<p>But the two worst things: a few months ago, they raised my monitoring rates with <i>no</i> notification whatsoever. I saw my monthly charge come in $5 higher than it used to be. Obviously not a ton of money but I'd like to know why I'm paying $60 more per year for the exact same service. I called them up and they said ""Well our rates are now different for those who aren't on a contract with us. If you'd like to go back to your normal rate, you'll need to sign a 3-year contract with us."" What, The, Fuck. I don't want a contract, especially not with a company who randomly decides to raise rates of their longest customers without notification.<p>So I decided to shut off the system monitoring. When I did so, to my horror I found that the entire system was bricked. The control panel says ""Not Activated"". They've once again fucked me, going back on their original statement that the hardware would work without monitoring.<p>So I'm done with them. They're a shitty company who's gone down the toilet over the past few years.<p>From the article here one of the LifeShield reps said they took a huge hit to their business because of some random clone on the web... that's probably bullshit.

They both have Enterprise Value (EV), which is normally calculated as operating income (EBITDA to be precise) * a multiplier. Market capitalization, or equity value, is by definition the different between the EV and the net debt (debt - cash). (P/E ratios are usually not as useful as the EV/EBITDA approach for understanding a company, btw.)<p>One company may be highly debt financed and the other may be pure equity financed. As you say, debt financing supercharges equity earnings (see below), but this comes at a higher risk. And in principle, the higher earnings are balanced out by the higher risk and therefore enterprise value is unchanged.<p>What is a bit harder is comparing two companies in entirely different industries, like Ford and FB!<p>Equity returns are supercharged by debt because in a growing company debt coupons are cheaper than equity returns. e.g., say you invest $100 to build a company that makes $20 a year. You get a 20% equity return. But imagine you invest $50 and borrow $50 to build a company that makes $20 a year. Your debt pays a typical 5% coupon, so you pay 50*5% = $2.5 in interest. The remaining $17.5 goes to your equity and you get a 35% equity return.

But I have to go with the OP on this one... I watched the Dart presentation from Lang.NEXT and laughed a bit to myself at one point because even in the presenter's example, the ""type documentation"" was already outdated. During his presentation it doesn't matter, because everyone watching is in the context of the code as part of his discussion. But if you put that code in front of somebody a year from now, out of context, would they immediately pick up on it? Or will they be frustrated by the fact that they expect the types to be what they say they are, but they aren't?<p>Are people really going to run in checked mode to verify their code? Or they going to do what they do with compiler warnings and turn them off as soon as they see one? I'm sure there will be a million blog posts titled ""Dart Best Practices"" that will say ""do not use checked mode, it slows down execution and prints confusing messages"". Of course, any bugs in checked mode will mean people will need to get their production systems working by ignoring checked mode.<p>I guess... my gut tells me that you should either have types, or not have types. Being in the middle creates too many opportunities for cognitive dissonance, too many opportunities for sneaky bugs, and too many opportunities to keep having this debate.

There have also been some important points brought up elsewhere in the comments about the ""sticker price"" versus what students actually pay.<p>Additionally, this is a complex issue, especially in the US where the perception of the value of a degree can vary wildly depending on the institution in question. One part of the original article that struck me as true is that high school students should be better coached during the process of choosing a college or university and then choosing a major or concentration.<p>The idea behind general human capital, though, is that it actually increases the ability of the student to thrive in a dynamic economy. The returns on an education with a significant ""holistic"" component are, at least in theory, higher than those on an education that is weighted toward job training.<p>For example, while it is certainly true that borrowing $100,000 to study pottery at a large university is probably not a good idea, there are enough colleges and universities in the US that if a student really wants to study pottery, he can do so for much less (for example, at a community college, where tuition costs are still quite reasonable).<p>But really, pottery (to continue the example, though this is applicable to many fields frequently cited as ""useless"") is closer to <i>specific human capital</i>. This actually helps explain why the students commonly featured in articles about these issues can't get jobs. They have been given ""job training"" for jobs that don't pay well or hardly even exist.<p>If their programs of study had been <i>more</i> ""holistic"" then perhaps they would be in better shape today (of course it should go without saying that there are counter-examples out there, I'm just talking about trends and averages here).<p>So <i>in some sense</i>, it seems that part of the problem is that we already focus too much on ""job training"", especially for low-return jobs. Of course a degree in finance (business schools do a great deal of job training) is far more lucrative, but the principle is the same.",1337001635

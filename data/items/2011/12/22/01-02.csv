It's actually gotten a lot better in the past 10 years, but in the 1980s/1990s, there was a time when countries looked like they might collapse in the sub-Sahara due to high numbers of HIV/AIDS victims, orphans, etc.  It was disproportionately affecting 15-35yo workers, and the fatalism caused by ""will probably die from AIDS anyway"" led to a lot more individual and organized violence.<p>Dealing with HIV, a general explosion in commodities prices, end of the Cold War, and hands-off Chinese infrastructure investment (tied to commodities, but without trying to influence the government, and thus acceptable) has gone a long way to help Africa.  Urbanization, IT/Communications (and access to regional/global markets), and foreign direct investment helps a lot too.",1324519084

3379998,comment,3379482,3379946,1,0,brk,,,"The interviewing process would usually flow along a line of screening out candidates that are potential hires and THEN trolling their LinkedIn profiles to see who you both know in common.  I think it would be tiresome to do that for EVERY candidate so that you can ask them during the interview ""Mind if I contact Foo."".<p>As long you apply a little discretion about it I don't see what the big deal is.  EG: don't contact someone at the candidates current company unless that contact really IS you BFF and you know they can keep the conversation private.<p>Also, if you do get any odd reviews you'd probably also want to give the candidate room to explain.  I wouldn't have a big issue with someone contacting random ex-coworkers of mine as references.  There is one person in particular though that probably wouldn't have good things to say, but digging further on that guy you'd realize he's a complete nutjob.  So, you'd just want to make sure you properly tempered all the feedback, but in that scenario you <i>should</i> see overall trends and be able to spot outliers.<p>I guess I'm also not highly opposed to this because I think most current interview tactics suck as screening methods, and  everyone hand-picks their references anyway, so you kind of need to go out of band to get a really reliable reference.<p>I'll also add that I think it depends somewhat on the level of person you're hiring.  I don't know if Halligan still personally interviews everyone coming into HubSpot.  If he does, I'm pretty sure he is not the one checking references for a level-1 phone jockey.  So, we're talking mostly about the higher-order candidates, key individual contributors and managers that he's doing this for.  It just doesn't strike me as such a deplorable practice.",1324519046

I knew this and I was pretty depressed at the time. I'm not very good at doing mindless work: some of the lectures I just stopped going to and other times I completely ignored the vacuous assignments I was being asked to do.<p>Looking back I wish I had dropped out and gone straight into a job with the programming skills I was teaching myself. (But I guess if I had done this I might not have learnt about fundamental CS concepts.)<p>I actually love learning but like to do it in my own way, on my own accord. I'm thinking of taking those online Stanford classes which are starting soon -- I guess the only thing that is missing from these is human conversation. I wonder if one day people might informally meet for coffee to discuss the online courses they're taking together. ;)",1324516343

On the other hand a different group complain about the lack of of 'real' cs, which is mostly math.<p>Two opposing views, but they think the argument is both in their favour.<p>There is also a massive backlash against universities in the UK at the moment. I am seeing many 'apprentice' software developers, and freelance developers skipping university. They tell me they know more than the average university graduate. So I ask them about complexity? Nope. Predicate Logic? Nope. These are things taught in even the lowest polytechnic school and they don't know them. They don't know the bounds of their own ignorance because they think cs is just knowing a few programming languages, whipping up a few apps and websites. They know more languages the average graduate? Maybe. Can they do software engineering? The easy business stuff. Do they know cs? No. I think they have never been exposed to cs and don't how deep it goes.<p>I've seen the accredited software developer apprenticeship curriculum and it's mostly java and design patterns.<p>I think the focus on apprenticeships at the moment is creating a generation of software developers who don't know what NP-Complete means.<p>Computer science is not whipping up applications with fancy design patterns, that's why you're better than them.

You can't necessarily read lawmakers' minds, and lots of law--especially the Constitution--was written by many different personalities often at odds with each other, where 'original intent' might not exist even theoretically.<p>Some people confuse the 'original meaning' theories of someone like Scalia with original intent, particularly since the words of the Founders could be used to support either theory. But it's a different thing. So you can talk about what the Founders meant, and it's a fine thing to think about, but it's not something that will get you far in the courtroom unless you can link that to what is written and what is in common law.",1324515707

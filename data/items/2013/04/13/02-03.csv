They've already decided they have a problem, and need to fix it.<p>Contrast that with polling a random sample of your target demographic, where any number of things can spoil the results. People could say they like the idea just to be polite. People could have never thought about the problem you're solving before, but think it's neat. People can misjudge how much they care about it. People can have an enthusiastic initial reaction, but think the idea is dumb on further reflection.<p>It's the same sort of problem with polling for election results: you can't ask a whole bunch of random people who they're going to vote for and turn the raw results into a pie chart. To get useful data, you have to carefully predict which of your respondents will actually turn up for the election, and which ones aren't going to change their mind between the time you poll them and voting day. And even then, in the end, it's not the pre-election polls that determine the new leader, it's the election itself.<p>That distinction is what's being presented here; asking a bunch of people is only useful if you're very careful about filtering out the junk answers. You should instead measure people who have already decided, without your prompting, that they have a problem and have decided to seek out a solution for it.",1365821468

I don't care if it's discrimination, because of her gender, whatever.

MSIL, the VM, and the class library are also part of a complete implementation.<p>In Android, the Java language syntax and semantics are used. In part, the class library is derived from Apache Harmony, though the implementation has substantially diverged, and in part is the original work of Google. The runtime is all specific to Android. The VM does not use Java bytecodes. It uses Dalvik bytecodes.<p>This is a neat trick: You can use Eclipse and most of the Java compilation chain. It diverges from Java where Java bytecodes are translated to Dalvik bytecodes. That means that every tool, even the ones that depend on Java bytecodes, works for Android development.<p>You can use other JVM languages with Android <a href=""https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/scala-ide/Developing_for_Android"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/scala-ide/Developing_for_...</a><p>But (!) that elegant way it all snaps together means you need to start by making C# a JVM language, which, as far as I know, hasn't been done.<p>A deep, dark irony of this is that the modern Microsoft runtime environment and class library stems from Visual J++, which Sun sued out of existence.

Considering that all you needed to ""catch them"" was to install Windows 7, this was really just waiting for someone that would notice the lack of the ballot that also had the channels to alert someone who would care.<p>I think this is missing the OP's point anyways, which is that if the perception of developers is that Microsoft's platform is hurting, then they need to publicly focus on positive boosting of that platform.

'Polynomial' implies some kind of direct assault on the protocol with difficulty not based on other actors.<p>And 'forking the blockchain' is also misleading.  You can fork the blockchain with even the smallest slice of power just by always working on the previous block instead of the current one.  The proper explanation is that if you have 40% of the power you have a 1/2 chance of forking a 6-block-old transaction.  This does not scale in any unexpected way.  If you wait 12 hours for a transaction then it becomes nearly impossible to fork with a minority of the network.  This is not a clever insight in any way.  It's obvious that since blocks are randomly timed that there is no sharp transition between 49% and 51% between no control and total control.  So an attacker only needs to get <i>close</i> to 50%.

It is useful to delineate between ""logic"" and ""reason"" here: reason is arriving at appropriate conclusions given the state of the world, and logic is the means by which we accomplish this. Using logic relies entirely on the premises chosen and assumptions made, which is where the ""human element"" comes into play. Many people, regardless of psychiatric diagnosis, are quite adept at cherry-picking premises such that, through careful selective ignorance, they arrive at pre-determined conclusions.<p>So if I had to make a very politically incorrect and anecdotal hypothetical assertion, I'd say that in my experience people on the autism spectrum indeed are more rigorously ""logical"" but they can also be correspondingly irrational; where someone not on the spectrum might be fine with a few measures of cognitive dissonance, someone on the spectrum might construct a labyrinthine fortress of logic to prevent any sort of uncomfortable or distasteful conclusions, and to reassure themselves that the world conforms to their notions of justice.<p>This is neither good nor bad, or any kind of judgment.

All this clean water is sourced from the sea, desalinated in energy-intensive plants, which take multiple years to build. When I was living in Qatar, fuel was less expensive than water, partly because Qatar (& UAE) have high oil/gas reserves but mainly because they have to expend a lot of resources to build desalination plants, often licensing technology & building materials from western nations. They can probably scale up water production relatively quickly in the coming few years to keep up with increasing water consumption, however other nations, including India, probably might not be that lucky in securing access to clean water for its citizens at an affordable cost.",1365818887

( That is, each block contains a hash of the previous one.) To build a valid block, a miner needs to verify that all transactions in the block are valid and solve a cryptographic problem, which requires 10 minutes for the aggregate computing power of the entire network. On the other hand, checking that the block chain is valid is a rather simple task, since it only involves checking if all the hashes are valid.<p><pre><code>    B1 -> Bx -> Bx3 -> Bx4      branch (with non valid block Bx)\n       \\n         ->B2->...              branch with all valid blocks (the miners work on this one)\n\n</code></pre>\nThe trick is then, that the longest block chain (without an invalid block) is assumed to be correct, and the honest miners are all working on this longest chain. ( That is what I meant with 'backed by most computing power.') For a transaction to be verified, there is actually no hard standard but in the Bitcoin paper [1] it is suggested to wait, until the transaction is 6 blocks removed from the newest block, since a malicious transaction could be introduced into the top of the block chain, e.g. at block Bx above. But the honest miners would not accept the block, continue to try to extend B1, and eventually they will find B2. ( And extend this branch.) The attacker ( who is working on the Bx chain) can then perhaps beat the network by luck for a few blocks ( Bx3, Bx4), but assuming the honest miners control most of the computing power at some point they will win. ( It should be noted that AFAIK there are no known deterministic algorithms for creating a valid block. Because of this, who solves the next block is a probabilistic process. So it is not the guy with the most computing power, but some random guy who had a chance proportional to his computing power just like everyone else.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a>",1365818611

My typical usage pattern is to connect twice, have one window where there is a long running task I want to monitor and a second where I am typing commands.  But I can't show one in one connection and the other in the other connection.<p>Note that I use byobu to front end things, and when using screen this can easily be done.  I have seen workarounds that involve using multiple copies of tmux talking to each other in various heroic configurations but that is silly.",1365818601

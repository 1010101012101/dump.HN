31431,comment,31402,31402,0,0,zach,,,"When you look at the ""network computer"" idea, it always made sense, but so many of its proponents just saw it the wrong way.<p>They figured that the server network would be much bigger, smarter and more distributed than individuals' computers.  Sure.  Makes sense.<p>So they went to work dumbing down PCs.  Oops.  They should have bet on the advancement of server network systems, not the regression of desktop technology.",1183056005

Women talk about Paris Hilton or whatever oddly-crrepy-looking person is ""of the moment"" as if they were family members or close friends.<p>""Oh, can you believe that she would...""
""And then she said...""
""We saw here do that are were <i>like</i>, whatever...""<p>Etc. Funny how rarely people can recognize how they are being manipulated. Even if typing crap into this blog (sorry, news aggregator) is a faux social activity, at least there's a chance someone will read and respond to me.",1183055982

Presumably a considerable amount (given that the project is in such an early stage).  That is not remotely the same thing as spec-work.<p>That being said, people here are right-- there is virtually NO value on the table here, so the OP should be willing to give up some serious equity.<p>Better yet, the OP should add a designer-partner.  Design is serious business and it's what separates the iPods from the Zunes...  It's an ongoing process and should be baked into the way you make software...  It certainly shouldn't be ""slap a coat of paint on it and we'll make millions"".<p>On the disclosure stuff, I agree.  Stealth mode is 99% of the time ridiculous.  That being said, there's no harm in being discreet.  If I were in the poster's shoes, I'd post a vague description and give plenty of detail to any designer who wanted to learn more.",1183053725

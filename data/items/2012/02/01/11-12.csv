The others got their sentences reduced in the first appeal but since he wasn't present for the appeal, his original sentence stands.

The ISPs carrying the signals and the state putting down the wire has been aiding the infrigement. The Linux servers running the torrent site and the collocation facilities are aiding in the infrigement.<p>Never before in Swedish justice history has this law been applied so rigorously as now. The monopoly mail-delivery system has never been trialed for aiding in spreading of illegal content such as child abuse pictures or bombs.<p>The messaging system has many uses, the trial did not even take this aspect up for discussion. The servers of thepiratebay where raided and with them several sites where taken down and servers where confiscated, still not returned.

3537518,comment,3535395,3535395,1,0,razzaj,,,"This is a load of crap. I think this attitude of justifying someone's wrong doing by pointing out that everyone else is doing it, is just hypocrisy. On the other hand I cant agree with people lashing out on apple because of this practice, although i do disagree with the practice in the first place. I will tell you why this seemingly contradictory stand isn't contradictory at all.<p>The practice of exploiting someone else's weaknesses for one's own advantage is widely spread and even sanctioned by some societies in general (implicitly and sometimes less so), the bottom of the problem is not tech companies abusing poor workforce, it is the general lack of consensus as to what is fair and what is not. Singling out a single actor from the flock is also unfair (such as is the case today with Apple - and just because they are so successful-). Not is it only unfair, it is counter productive because it will hurt apple and in no way do any good to the chinese workers.<p>Now, we want to fix the problem? Then we need to first figure out what the fuss is all about, and i say that is easy!<p>This entire argument, it looks to me, boils down to fairness. The question of What is Fair, and what is not (or evil if you will). It is not a new argument, for ages people have tried to settle on a general agreement on what it is to be leading the good life. Religions were built around this and constitutions were designed for that as well; the social contract that defines who we are as Americans, Chinese, Arabs, French, Christians, Muslims etc.... It has however been very difficult to bring all these people to agree together to one single approach to life, and so over eons people have ""siloed"" each with their own ""moral code"".<p>And i say companies (including apple) have all abided by these contracts and are not abusing any of their compatriots. So in essence they are not in violation of anything. Why? simply because the ""abused"" -by western standards- people you are concerned about are not being abused in America, but in China, and what's more? Their treatment is not considered to be abuse in China, it is legal THERE.<p>This is horrifying, because it is cool to indirectly abuse someone overseas as long as you treat your compatriots fairly? I say not, but in order to make it un-cool we need to agree to a new universal bill of ethics where things are more defined and definitive like What is a minimum fair working condition universally.<p>What now?<p>I think it is time for tech companies that have made billions (including apple) to take a step back and ponder their moto ""we do stuff that changes the world"", add to it "" ... to be a better place for all"" and apply it on all the aspects of their business. This new bill of ethics once finalsed can be ""ratified"" by these monster companies and others will follow. The reason i am specifically speaking of tech companies it because i know tech and the hacker spirit and i can assert that there is a general good will and faith to make the world a better place, and since the world has given us, and still is, great things and lots of appreciation, the industry and community is mature enough ,now, to start giving back and leading  by example.",1328095982

I'm a co-founder with a start-up that just joined a prominent accelerator, and we do two of the five things listed: book-swapping and daily deals. While my opinion may be slightly biased about book-swapping because of that, I have done a ton of research into the market and there is definitely a market-pull for something that allows simple, intuitive book-swaps. Obviously, it has to be safer and simpler (or at a decent fiscal advantage) compared to craigslist, ebay, amazon etc, but I think that it is do-able with the right business model, team, swapping algorithms...<p>You often hear about this idea (and maybe the other 4 as well, but I can't say from personal expertise) because there <i>IS</i> a need for a service like this and entrepreneurs know that. But I see two main problems that keep these book-swap start-ups from succeeding, and keep these ideas from going away.<p>First, there's a TON of variation in the way you can setup this business model. There are dozens of different ways to make your money, a handful of drastically different customers you can try and target, and endless ways to setup/code the swapping process. Not every solution will be successful; most will be unsuccessful.<p>Second, I don't think this idea works as a stand-alone product for a start-up because of a handful of factors. One such example: book swapping ""season"" (start & end of semesters) only occurs a few times a year. For a start-up with cash flow like that (or none), each ""book season"" is going to be swinging for the fences, after months of work, and hoping you can grab the attention of the market during the only few weeks they might care about your product.<p>Sorry if I was vague at times, I didn't wanna get into details.",1328094053

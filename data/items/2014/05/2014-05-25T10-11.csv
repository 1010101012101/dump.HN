7796043,comment,7795035,7795901,2,0,sampo,,,"> <i>All that NFL says is that if you fix an optimization algorithm and average its performance over all possible measurable functions, no algorithm will be better than the other.</i><p>> <i>Therefore, trying to design a fully generic optimization algorithm is a fool&#x27;s errand.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think we have any factual disagreement. In pure mathematical context, what you say is absolutely true.<p>I just wish to emphasize, that &quot;all possible measurable functions&quot; and &quot;fully generic optimization algorithm&quot; have very specific mathematical meanings here, and those meaning are probably different than what a casual reader might expect.<p>In a set of &quot;all possible functions&quot; an overwhelming majority are functions that are indistinguishable from random noise. They are e.g. not continuous, not even remotely like continuous, they have no structure at all whatsoever.<p>On an intuitive level, everybody understands that it is a fool&#x27;s errand to try to design an optimization algorithm to find the maximum from an array of random numbers. But when you just say &quot;trying to design a fully generic optimization algorithm&quot;, people may not realize that the &quot;fully generic&quot; contains the requirement that it should also work on random noise.<p>The No Free Lunch Theorem does not say anything about the feasibility of fully generic optimization algorithms, if we restrict the &quot;fully generic&quot; to mean anything that can be expected to appear in any real world application. A lot of people might agree that an algorithm that performs well in any real world problem is &quot;fully generic&quot;, even though it may not perform well in all imaginable abstract mathematical settings (which mostly means settings of random noise).<p>To your last comment: I also agree with you on this front. Also my understanding is that for every or almost every type of problem there are other optimization algorithms that drastically outperform genetic algorithms. I also like your &quot;snake oil&quot; metaphor, and I was happy to see your top comment on this topic.",1401014846

I own my food but I couldn&#x27;t sell it (I don&#x27;t have the right licenses). I own my clothes but I still have to comply with the law when I do things with them. That laws/HOAs/etc. regulate what I can do with my flat does not feel substantially different.<p>Taxes too are orthogonal to ownership; where I live people treat the local government tax as another utility bill, like water or electricity (so when renting sometimes the landlord pays or sometimes the tenant does). If I owned a car I&#x27;d pay tax on it - but if I leased a car I&#x27;d also pay tax on it in the same way.<p>Words have meanings but are necessarily simplifications (just as a map cannot capture every detail of the territory). In legalese I lease my flat - but in English I own it, because how I use it and what I can and can&#x27;t do with it has much more in common with something that I own than with something that I rent or lease.",1401014774

I was excited when I saw this and thought maybe Eric was updating it.<p>In general of course this is a great book to read, I have a hard copy (gasp) on my shelf and when it came out I had been working on Unix systems for 20 years.  There are lots of good nuggets in there.  It is a good read for people who would like to better understand the philosophy of Unix.  That said if I recall correctly it was a bit cult like in nature and like most things should be taken with a grain of salt.  Remember the historical context of when the book was written, it was very much a war like time when many Unix heads where certain we could &quot;win&quot; the OS wars.  Much like the &quot;Drug Wars&quot; now I think a bit of reality has set in and we realize things are not always that black and white.<p>It would be awesome to see a body of work like this updated with today’s evolution of the Unix philosophy.  When I look back I think I’m so lucky to be in technology today, what used to take me months and years I can do today in days and weeks.  We have so much foundation now, technology is more about Legos™ versus bags of Concrete.  When I started in technology almost everything had to be built from scratch, often starting with little more then a simple computer language, some cpu, ram and maybe a disk if you where lucky.   That made things so incredibly hard when you wanted to do anything of real value.  Today it would be impossible to design the chips we use without the chips we built last generation and the software that leverages that power to help the people design the next generation of chips.  We live in a world that builds on top of many generations of technology and the amplification effect is amazing to see first hand.<p>Great book, read it, enjoy it and then read Eric’s other book (of many):\n   The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary",1401013498

If they need to buy more Farmville stars they can just go to a shop and top up their phone. Google supports this on a limited number of operators, but even in places like the UK where operator billing is quite mature, they only support it on one.

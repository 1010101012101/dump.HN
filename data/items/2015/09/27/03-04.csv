10285396,comment,10284383,10285227,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"> Wow... how... how do you fix a place like this? How do you move such a medieval religious society into freedom?<p>Not a good idea. The Middle East has had a succession of &quot;enlightened&quot; despots who attempted to rid their countries of Islam. Islam is not just a faith for these people, it&#x27;s a way of life, so well entrenched in the social fabric that all these rulers managed to do was to inflict even worse human rights violations and galvanize the population against the demon West.<p>You have to let them find their own way. It may take them a few hundred years, but eventually their society will slowly pry open. The external threats to their way of life will have to cease, as long as they feel like they&#x27;re under attack by the West, they&#x27;ll just cocoon off and just not allow any influences in.<p>Probably the best thing that could happen in this regard is a permanent collapse in oil prices, though that would likely cause a lot of people to starve. Things would get a lot worse for them before they get better. I read an article recently about how the Saud family is trying their hardest to prepare for a post-oil world.<p>> Is there a simple explanation for why the Christian West moved to relative secularism a couple centuries ago while Saudi Arabia has remained so medieval, despite oil-powered industrialisation?<p>Because colonialism. Europe brought industry to the rest of the world at the point of a gun. An excellent book to read on this topic is Fields of Blood by Karen Armstrong.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Fields-Blood-Religion-History-Violence/dp/0307946967"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Fields-Blood-Religion-History-Violence...</a>",1443326142

What I think you mean is that the only branches are release branches and the development branches on each dev&#x27;s machine.<p>At my startup, we use feature branches, and we expect devs to continually merge master into their branch while it&#x27;s under development (ideally daily), and to fix any resulting conflicts or test failures. We have them push these branches to the repo (which triggers our continuous integration server), but they&#x27;re treated as private works in progress. Then, when they finish and pass code review, we&#x27;re confident that they will merge seamlessly, since they&#x27;ve been merging master all along. (We also use git merge --squash for the final merge to avoid seeing all the intermediate commits on the master commit log.)<p>I&#x27;m trying to understand if your practices are meaningfully different. Do developers have private branches on their machines for weeks on end? Are they encouraged to regularly merge master into those private branches?",1443325802

10285383,comment,10284587,10285322,0,0,natrius,,,"I thought this up last week, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I&#x27;m not the first. It&#x27;s a combination of a few popular ideas.<p>The financial crisis got people thinking critically about what money is, especially the people who hopped on the Ron Paul boat back in the 2008 election season. (I hope you&#x27;ll hear me out even if you consider those folks to be crazy people.) That&#x27;s when I first understood that money is debt.<p>Bitcoin gave us blockchains: the ability to create ledgers that we can agree on without authority. You send transactions to move amounts in the ledger. Ethereum allows us to create arbitrary transaction types that modify the state that transaction type controls.<p>The Clojure and React communities got me thinking more about different ways to think about state. State is the result of transactions, and if you keep either the transactions or the previous states around, you can control time in your program, among other things.<p>Apache Kafka, Samza, and related projects introduced me to the concept of a database as a transaction log. One potentially useful application that my coworker pointed out is that we could write events to a Kafka database, then <i>change what they mean later</i>. State is a function of a list of transactions and a transaction processing function. You can change your transaction processing function at any time. Anyone who has the transactions can build their own view of the world with a function they define, so everyone can have their own calculation of merit, for instance.<p>I&#x27;ve thought for some time that while governments are useful, it&#x27;d be better if we could find ways to achieve the same ends without giving anyone power over us. I&#x27;ve been exploring ways to use blockchains to give society the power to self-organize and provide the things we currently need governments to provide for us.<p>Merit capitalism is a combination of those ideas, and probably more parts of the idea soup in my brain.",1443325769

10285371,comment,10283990,10284805,0,0,matthewbadeau,,,"I hate commenting on the internet, especially since it&#x27;s going to go against almost every idea that the original commenter posted. That aside, here is my advice for studying Japanese. This is purely my opinion and one method that I&#x27;ve been using.<p>- Try to evaluate where you want to &#x27;end up&#x27; with your fluency. If you want a full time job in a business environment then I highly recommend learning polite forms of verbs first. The more that your practice this form, the more comfortable it&#x27;ll be to use. If you want to talk casually to friends and family, then learning just the plain form is ok. If you want the slow, long, methodical approach to learning Japanese and achieve a much greater fluency, learn the plain form <i>and</i> the negative form at the same time along with the polite form. I highly advise against using the plain form with people you&#x27;ve met for the first time or are dealing with in a business setting. It&#x27;s very off-putting since it feels like you&#x27;re talking like a child. I recommend learning the plain form and the negative form at the same time because of the structure of Japanese verbs. Learning both of these forms at the same time will give you an immediate hint as to how all of the other verb inflections should appear. This will become apparent when you&#x27;re learning conditional, potential, volition and passive verbs.<p>- Tae Kim&#x27;s guide is good for understanding many concepts quickly but the website I prefer the most is Imabi.net[1]. It contains more content and is constantly being updated and edited to improve its content.<p>- Learning katakana right after hiragana is vital if you want to live in Japan. Also, try to associate only the sound with the character, not a mnemonic. Use that time to focus on your pronunciation. Many borrowed words from other languages use katakana and learning katakana at the beginning will help you remember those words faster. For example, a common word used in Japanese is トレーニング. It sounds awfully close to &quot;training&quot; and since it&#x27;s in katakana, it gives you a hint as to what the word might mean. While katakana words are not 100% borrowed words, it certainly appears to be above 80%. Related to this, do not learn romaji as a way of writing characters.<p>- I agree, do not avoid learning kanji. Always learn kanji with vocabulary. I don&#x27;t recommend Heisig&#x27;s book if you&#x27;re taking the long, methodical approach I mentioned earlier. It includes a lot of mnemonics that I don&#x27;t think actually contribute to the actual kanji&#x27;s reading. Plus, if you <i>do</i> go through the entire series, then you&#x27;ll still be behind in your kanji learning. There are a lot of words that you still don&#x27;t know the meaning to! For example, 八百屋 and 海老 don&#x27;t mean 800 shops and ocean&#x27;s old. They mean produce market and shrimp respectively. My recommendation is to learn vocabulary and the kanji readings for that vocabulary.<p>- I don&#x27;t read manga, personally, but another way to learn conversational Japanese is by watching television shows and mimicking them! (On the other hand, I don&#x27;t recommend mimicking anime.) If you like manga, then go for it! Just go for your favourite entertainment medium. If you&#x27;re learning conversational Japanese, then try to find a serious language partner. Find someone who is a native Japanese speaker trying to learn your native language. Allocate 1 hour or a half hour to go over Japanese and another equal block of time in your native language. Native English speakers will have the easiest time searching for a language partner but don&#x27;t give up if your native language isn&#x27;t English.<p>- Textbooks are good for certain circumstances. I believe textbooks are good for the long, slow methodical approach. It keeps you focused and gives you goals to work towards. If you don&#x27;t like textbooks, then pick up a non-fiction book and try reading! It&#x27;ll force you to pause, give thought to the meaning of the sentence and look up words/grammar. The non-fiction book method will probably take longer than a textbook though, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out. Fiction books will be extremely difficult because they will sometimes make up words that won&#x27;t appear in dictionaries.<p>- I actually prefer large lists of vocabulary. I get the greatest benefit from lists of nouns since I pick those up the fastest. As the original commenter pointed out, this is definitely not for everyone. Reading books or manga will give a more entertaining method for learning new words. It&#x27;ll even give you the more nuanced meaning of words. The right and wrong places to use them, etc. Check out the Tatoeba[2] project as well for example sentences using the words you&#x27;re learning.<p>For any language you&#x27;re learning, try to use the language as you&#x27;re learning it. Try to come up with new sentences based on what you&#x27;ve learned. Try to talk to people using the new verbs you learned. Try using Lang-8[3] for writing.<p>Japanese is really difficult because although I&#x27;ve been studying it for a year and a half now, I still don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m &#x27;fluent&#x27;. I can give you examples of things that I&#x27;ve been able to achieve using Japanese but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t call myself fluent. Using the CEFR, I would probably put myself between B1 and B2 for certain circumstances and maybe between A2 and B1 for other circumstances. Learning Japanese will take time, don&#x27;t give up.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.imabi.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imabi.net/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tatoeba.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tatoeba.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://lang-8.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lang-8.com/</a>",1443325376

My zsh has always been my most reliable and used tool. Almost every piece of software I&#x27;ve ever used has caused me some headache---GNOME, Firefox, even vim, you name it. zsh never froze, or screwed up my work due to a bug, or anything like that. It always follows what I tell it to do with almost annoying diligence, and if I don&#x27;t get the result I wanted, I know it&#x27;s my fault. I&#x27;ve never liked using graphical file managers or, God forbid, some graphical renaming tool, to name an example off the top of my head. I feel immense power when I&#x27;m at my shell, because whenever I want to <i>manipulate</i> stuff---from the directory structure, to chaining some commands together to achieve a task, convert audio between formats, getting some quick info out of big files, etc., I always do it using the shell (well, and also the coreutils, sed, awk and others, but I believe my point stands). I know it&#x27;s a basic thing that all people using Unix systems do and don&#x27;t think much about it, but the amount of complex things it can do while staying so minimalist sometimes blows my mind. To me, the simple yet powerful text interface feels almost Zen. And although many shells have come and passed, each with its own quirks and weirdness, the underlying principles have barely changed. It&#x27;s just that perfect. So here&#x27;s one for the shell: the quiet hero of Unix :)",1443324318

In fact, the body rapidly becomes accustomed to opiates and will require higher and higher doses that can become dangerous. The united states uses orders of magnitude more opiates than all other countries, and that often comes from potentially a cultural aversion to pain, but also many patients specifically seek out and ask for pain meds.<p>In fact, the scenarios you mention, of post herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and neuropathy should NEVER be treated with opiates. There are highly effective neuroleptics and medications like carbamazepine, gabapentin, and TCAs that are first line and highly effective for these syndromes. While painful, given that it is neuropathic pain, often with rapid onset and offset, opiates, even PRN medication, is not appropriate management and does not help with its treatment. Adjuvant therapy including topical creams like capsaicin as well as minor procedures like nerve blocks and injections are pursued if first line treatments do not work. Often I see people in clinic who were aggressive about opiates and got opiates for these syndromes and spiral into addiction and problems while the underlying problem is untreated.<p>Opiates are not a panacea for all pain, and its troubling with patients see it that way, and often insist on opiate medications.",1443324199

Even if the time spent doesn&#x27;t save that much time, but makes things less frustrating, it&#x27;s a big win to me.  There&#x27;s a lot to be said for having processes that are predictable, that don&#x27;t randomly have issues that require taking time out of your day to resolve before you get to your actual problem.  I&#x27;d be surprised if there was a significant percentage of companies that don&#x27;t spend at least some time solving these types of problems.  I think the question that this article brings up, is what that ratio should be to actually gain.",1443323745

Instead I'm working on writing up stuff that can be useful to a wider audience (instead of the few dozen people who would read this comment.) I'll submit it here when I eventually finish writing it up.<p>Secondly, there's a lot of fractured mutually incompatible thought that goes under the banner of ""Singularity"". There's a lot of people who <i>do</i> think it has to do with some sort of intersecting exponential curves (this is the Kurzweil school of thought).<p>See this link for an overview of the three mutually exclusive camps, as told by Eliezer Yudkowsky: <a href=""http://www.singinst.org/blog/2007/09/30/three-major-singularity-schools/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.singinst.org/blog/2007/09/30/three-major-singular...</a><p>""<i>One wonders how the misunderstanding got so common if that's not what the advocates said!</i>""<p>There is no ""the advocates"", because ""Singularitarianism"" isn't a single movement.  The fact that it's fractured only indicates that there's three (or more) different camps -- these are <i>different</i> people saying <i>different</i> things, not the same people acting as a 'moving target'. I don't see how that makes it a religion. And you're right that there's a decent chunk of people who are dreaming of utopia and bliss and do take a Sci-Fi sort of attitude toward it -- but there are good scientific reasons to work on these issues, and good reasons to be worried about the implications.<p>For what it's worth, my claim basically comes down to two things: 1) AI is feasible. 2) There will be profound changes when AI appears on the scene. And we need to worry about the big issues relating to this.<p>I <i>hate</i> the term 'singularity'. It's too associated with Kurzweil's take on things, and it evokes connotations of a 'hard takeoff'. I prefer to just talk about AI's importance, feasibility, implications, and dangers.",1212947918

As long as the system is out there, then just like old chinese saying ""With money, you can hire ghosts to push mill wheel""<p>Of course there will be wealth inequality in such a system. So it is up to people to choose ""everyone lives better but allow some huge wealthy guys"" or ""let every one poorer but more equal"". As long as the existing wealth creators understand if they intervene the system in order to keep their power to control, then the payoff for new innovators disappears immediately and the system is screwed.So they will come to understand instead of abusing their power, they should just help fostering new innovators and keep the system working.",1212947527

212173,comment,212083,212112,0,0,eugenejen,,,"I just got an epiphany after PG mentioned the merchant class in China. Big advancement such as gun powder, movable types was invented in Song Dynasty. Song Dynasty was in fact one rare period in China that had a pretty vibrant merchant class. But after Ming Dynasty, most Chinese historians judged Song Dynasty as a pretty lame era. (""smaller territory, continuous conflicts with northern enemies and finally lost to Mongol) But from economics history aspect, Song dynasty was a pretty well developed period.<p>-- Edit --<p>Wikipedia has a pretty good summary of Song Dynasty. And one reason for the economic development in Song was the government loosed regulations on market economy... Does this sound familiar to anyone?",1212945377

It also dissuades you from competing during and after employment, and to stay 'on-side.'<p>I was in a similar position to you but did not ultimately take the job. In my case, I already had a similar site going to the potential employer so could actually compete without too much effort. The employer was prepared to give equity only after 6 months work.",1212945006
212169,comment,211696,211902,0,0,rplevy,,,"Not all religious systems are based on faith.  It seems to me that the faith aspect of some religions is a side effect of the fact that religion is motivated by a desire to explain and/or celebrate human purpose.  To logically argue that (human) purpose is fundamental is a difficult thing to do, and as a result many religions are illogical and are based on faith.  But there are many varieties of religion that don't rest on miracles.  For example mysticism is a religion that is not based on dogma, but is a purely biological religion, in which understanding of purpose is derived from first-hand phenomenological experience (as most people who have taken LSD or reached some level of expertise in meditation can attest to).  Sure, some mystics make stupid dogmatic statements and unfalsifiable claims related to these experiences, but that's just guilt by association.  The Singularity could be another example of a religion, in this case a religion in which purpose is derived from a sense of the inevitable progress to a valorized endpoint (the ""Point Omega"" is what Teilhard de Chardin, the Catholic mystic and biologist termed it, and some Singularity-ists have adopted his terminology). It is not based on faith but on reasoned logic (which very well could be wrong), but the very zeal and the way in which human purpose is derived from it are enough reason to call it a religion.<p>One problem with this type of discussion is that religion is sometimes subject to the same kind of moving target definition that AI is subject to. If a philosophical system that was considered religious becomes viable/practical, it is defined out of being a religion?  I myself look forward to the day when all religions are based on ideas that work, rather than belief in miracles.",1212944885

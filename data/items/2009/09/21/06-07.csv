I compose the songs and play vocals and guitars. We're planning on recording a new album all DIY using a USB condenser mic with built in mixer from Samson (GM1U).",1253516316
834123,comment,833362,833836,0,0,zby,,,"XMPP is only the connection part of the Wave - the other, if not more complex then at least much less understood part, is <a href=""http://www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers/operational-transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers/operational-transfor...</a> which is a theory about how to change a document according to concurrent editing commands streams.  The idea is that using a special document structure and operations you can emulate the interface of any communication application (in email that document is a thread of conversation with rules allowing people append new 'emails', irc channels can be similarly represented with the document being the channel 'screen', you can even represent a chess game as a series of editing of the chess board).  This generality let's you mix and match freely the communication modes used in different communication tools (like wiki and im etc).",1253516271

Compared to other translations, this one doesn't make sense at all as you don't get any advantages of the translations result.<p>Compare this to a translator that translates Ruby to JS: Here you get the ability to run Ruby in the browsers. Or JRuby where you get the ability to run Ruby in a Java-only environment (plus a bit of performance in some cases), or IronRuby for the same reasons for the .NET platform.<p>But PHP?

834111,comment,833882,833882,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Speaking of child prodigies--I've noticed something extremely odd about childhood ability in my own experiences.<p>I got a 5 on the Calculus AB AP exam when I was ~10 years old and around the same time got a ~1490 (I don't remember exactly) on the SAT.  6 years later, I did no better on the SAT than I did when I was a preteen and I didn't feel as if I was any better at math than I had been 6 years earlier.<p>Despite the fact that I had done so well at math as a child, I was never competitive in the higher-level math competitions like the AMC and AIME, where I consistently scored mediocre (~110 on the AMC, ~0-1 on the AIME).  I went to school with plenty of classmates who scored near-perfect on both competitions and yet had not been nearly as much of a supposed ""prodigy"" as I was.<p>Today, I doubt I am even <i>above average</i> at my college; I am relieved to have simply passed the math courses required for my major with barely-tolerable grades.  And yet whenever I read stories of ""real"" prodigies, I never see anything like this--they always seem to continue their trend and prove to be brilliant mathematicians.  Or is this selection bias?<p>I still don't fully understand what happened.  Does mathematical ability plateau at an early age?  Is there something special about courses beyond basic calculus that are inherently more difficult?  Did my skill simply stop developing because I lost interest?",1253515320

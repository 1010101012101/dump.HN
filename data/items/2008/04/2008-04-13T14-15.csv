I have 7 years of experience in this industry, though I left it last year to find another industry that is not shrinking as fast as this one is. I have kept up with the trends in that industry and believe that the idea can help businesses in this industry tremendously.<p>I am curious if anyone has ever entered an industry that is struggling to adjust to an entirely new landscape, as print media currently is. Is the risk too large? Can a new business become successful? I certainly believe it can if it solves a major hurdle that the industry is facing, however I am interested in opinions from people who may be in the industry, or those have attempted to make a go of it in an industry in crisis.",1208097396

When I have an idea, I try to make mockups or crude specs as soon as a I can,  and have some sort of basic prototype within a week or two.<p>Just like you use feedback from blogs to separate the good ideas from the bad, I usually show a few friends my prototype.  I have abandoned several projects at the prototype stage, but that's more a question of ""Is this something I want to commit a lot of time to?"" rather than ""Is this a decent idea?"".",1208097244

162418,comment,161927,162316,0,0,white,,,"That's what confuses me a lot. What is the reason to get Mac with Darwin and purchase a secondary laptop with any type of Linux on it?  Come on, you are shredding your money away. ;)  But this is a pretty common behavior and frequently asked question over here.  Is it a try to look more ""geeky""?<p>A lot of people motivate that Linux has got an apt and this makes it a hacker friendly platform.  I've started using FreeBSD from 2-RELEASE (sorry, don't remember the numbers).  The ports sucked there so much, that you can't even imagine now.  But it still was a great platform to develop and to use.<p>The Darwin' port system is a very nice tool.  They're really similar to BSD ports and they are powerful enough.  You just never learned how to use it.  Do you still miss apt?  Get Fink (<a href=""http://www.finkproject.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.finkproject.org</a>).  What can be easier?<p>People, don't get me wrong, I'm not about a holy war.  But I'm really confused why guys over here want to have two laptops running Unix at the same time. ;)",1208097121

162415,comment,162341,162341,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is an interesting counter-point to the ""do something, anything -- right now"" school of thought.<p>I think ""good ideas"", whatever that term means, motivates people to get into the arena. You need something that you feel makes sese with the world. Once you're in the arena, however, it's the flexibility and adaptation that matters. (Fair warning: I'm blowing smoke here, as all I've done is struggle these last few years)<p>There are two things that I have noticed. First, no matter what your idea or concept, once you put enough work into it you tend to get motivated. So motivation can come later, not at the beginning or a project. Second, really good concepts exist whether you work on them or not. I know -- I've had a couple of really good concepts I've worked on which didn't work out. My execution ability lacked. But the concept didn't just dissapear -- heck no. Some other groups with a lot more execution ability took them and ran with them. (and made a lot of money)<p>This leads me to believe that really good concepts are like races. Once you ""get it"", be assured that a dozen or more other people have it also. So you're in a race. I say take all the time you want finding something you feel has magic, but once you got it, run like heck as fast as you can, because time is running out.<p>I'm in a mode currently where I'm consulting and saving for a few months to run as a startup for a year or so. In the last couple of days I had one of those ""ah-ha"" moments that occur to me every few years or so. Quite frankly, it scares the crap out of me -- I'm not ready, it's bad timing, I don't have a team in place, etc. But once the idea clicks, the clock starts ticking.<p>BTW -- anybody interesteed in doing some P2P-type startup work and looking for a team, drop me a line.<p>EDIT: And I'm not actually an ""idea"" person. By good idea in this post, I mean a general fuzzy concept that maximizes dozens of criteria simultaneously: marketing, money, deployment, etc. It's an area of interest, perhaps a slogan. But not a concrete thing. You get the concrete thing by executing the concept in the real world, not by imagining it.",1208097086
162414,comment,162341,162341,0,0,edw519,,,"Funny, this is not my experience.<p>Whenever I have an idea, I want to act upon it immediately.  And then continue to work on it.  Sure, I will need occasional breaks, but this is what I think happens...<p>I find it a little easier to think about an idea when I have something sketched out on paper.  I find it a lot easier when I have a prototype, no matter how limited.  Both the processes of getting it on paper and getting it on-line clarify my thinking much more than just thinking about it.<p>I often have to crumple up a lot of paper and scrap a lot of code, but the paper and the code are not what's important.  It's what I thought about while I did them that has advanced my thinking about the idea.",1208096554

Some stars might come out of each group, but others would fade to obscurity.<p>The similarity between the two programs is only shared in the one aspect, however; While YC does offer greatly increased blog coverage the real strength of the program is the networking between developers and participation by other YC teams and leaders in helping to suggest and guide during the development process.<p>Given that we do see several developers repeating the process from one MacHeist to the next, they must find that the additional publicity is worthwhile to them.",1208096202

This is what's leftover from what committees and executives decided the application needed to do with no thought whatsoever to anyone who would actually be using it.  Notice how the most relevant information for the technician is on the fourth tab over, in a tiny unsizeable window next to a massive expanse of empty space.  Note that several of the tabs seem to be describing the same thing.  Where do you go to find out what you have to do?  'description?' 'instructions?'  'sub-tasks?' 'change details?'  Why not 'general?'<p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg.  This thing was an enormous, slow, resource-hogging java applet that required internet explorer.  It no offline mode yet booted you off every 15 minutes which sometimes made you close out of IE and clear the cache or else you couldn't log back in.  The boot-off process involved the entire application leaping into the foreground interrupting anything else you might have been doing.",1208095691

Basically Stella is timing the backend performance and network speed from a single server in a single location.<p>Since 80% of performance is front-end, I find it's often more interesting to look at rendering time instead.  Most websites can get the html back to you in a few hundred milliseconds.  The more interesting question is how long it will take the browser to download and render the associated resources.  This is the pain your visitors will be feeling and probably the one you should focus on.  Instead of trying to get your server response down from 500ms to 200ms, focus on getting your onload time down from 5 seconds to 2.<p>One great open-source tool for measuring front-end performance is <a href=""http://www.webpagetest.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webpagetest.org/</a>.  It allows you to test sites from various locations around the world in and it gives you detailed performance data,  waterfall graphs and even videos of the page loading.

Nevertheless, I've seen a lot of this style of parenting applied to my peers.<p>The pernicious thing about this parenting style is that it <i>appears</i> to work very well for the first 18 years. Then, the child graduates from high-school, and goes to college. Some break down without the constraints imposed by hovering parents and constant scheduling. Some get pulled into the wrong crowds and end up doing questionable or illegal activities.  But the most unlucky ones go through college just fine.<p>Why are these the most unlucky ones? Once they're done with the academic grind, they look around and <i>have no goals</i>. They never developed the ability to create their own goals - to be self directed. Not only is this a huge disadvantage in their personal lives, but it hurts job performance as well. No assignment at work is going to be as well defined as a school project. No manager will babysit these people as much their teachers and parents did. What ends up happening is that these people find themselves being surpassed by others who have less skill, as the others have much more self direction and the ability to push themselves without requiring external motivation.",1294782788

It's a common misconception that professors work very hard for tenure and then, once they get it, are free to do whatever they want.  (In other words, that there is some ""threshold"".)  Instead, the system is set up to keep professors on a treadmill until they are very old through grant ""carrots"".  Yes, it's possible once you secure tenure to just hang out and think deep thoughts, but this leads to salary stagnation or even regression.  Instead, most professor continually chase money by cranking out research.  Taking time off to write books means significantly less salary, (which is not nearly made up for by book royalties).<p>(This is my impression as a physics grad student.  Other department might be a bit different.)<p>2.  I claim that the hardest part about writing books is distinguishing what's obvious from what's not <i>for the student</i>.  Once you've been using the material for years, it's very difficult to remember all the tiny mental leaps that are required to get from point A to point B.  Yes, you need a mastery of the material to write a book, but sufficient mastery for textbook writing comes with only a few years of research experience (as opposed to, say, review papers which require extra experience because they are more-cutting-edge/less-canonical).<p>3.  Even if tenured professors <i>didn't</i> have a penalty for writing textbooks and they <i>were</i> the most qualified (in contradiction to my first two claims) there needs to be some serious incentive for them to get off their ass and write a whole book.  Those incentives doesn't exist right now.  A lack of penalty isn't enough.",1294781635

Check out the homepage http://justremindit.com for more details like what are the benefits of Voice call based reminders, who is it useful for, etc.<p>This was basically a class project for my wife’s iPhone programming class.

Then I showed it to my lawyer, my dentist, and they wanted it too. So finally we decided to commercialize it.<p>Then she continued with her Masters, and I started working on commercializing this app. It took more than 6 months in part-time (actually part-time of part-time since I already work on my other part-time project, and this is my 2nd project) to make it at par with commercial apps in the App Store. Finally, it's available to download here - http://appsto.re/JustRemindIt. App is FREE to download, and comes with few free reminder credits to play around. After that you can recharge your account with pay-as-you-go model.<p>Please download the app, use it, and let me know your feedback - all kinds of inputs are welcome. If you like the app, I'll really appreciate if you can write review as well.<p>I'm super excited about this first step and looking forward to real challenges that will begin now. I've lots of plans for future versions, like support for recurring reminders, SMS or Email reminders, seamless integration with Contacts and Calendar, Group reminders, etc. So please let me know your inputs, they will help me to work on the right features.<p>Thanks HN!

A polling application tracking Smartphone users polls by state, gender and other categories. Was supposed to be launched 15 days prior to the Elections. Apple delayed it and launched it on the eve of the elections. Made 500 users in 5 hours but the election ended and so did interest in my app.<p>2) Feeding off the 5 hour stardom effect, created a new application called Intimate Secrets. Again a very interactive polling based app to cater to users of all age groups, marital statuses and interests. Getting polls on questions that usually don't get asked. Had amazing success the first two days where the application was displayed on the most recent app page on the app store. As soon as app went to the third page downloads dropped again. Try to run a marketing campaign on Google and partner sites spreading awareness of the app. But the only successful way to market an Iphone app is to market it on the App store and there was no way of doing that back then. So the list of failures grow.<p>3) Switched focus from smart phones back to the web. Created an interactive portal on facebook to merge Social Commerce, Affiliate marketing and E-commerce. App was called CareToShare. Where the user will receive affiliate earnings by sharing their purchases on facebook. Friends will get promotional discounts and the companies will get more sales. Thought it was a win-win model. Presented it to companies like BestBuy and shopping channel. They weren't that willing to change their marketing campaigns or I wasn't convincing enough. So CareToShare remained in sandbox and didn't see the light of day.<p>4) Latest Venture Social Genie (<a href=""http://www.sgenie.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sgenie.com</a>). A Facebook app that provides you an interactive tool to make a wish and share it with your friends. Your friends can make contributions through PayPal. The app also allows you to see all the wishes made by your friends along with list of contributors, comments statuses. With this app I am competing with major players like FundRazr (lets users instantiate fund raisers) that have already stroked partnerships with PayPal. PayPal is promoting their app to all their users and are heavily investing in the company. When asked PayPal for similar support for my app, so far all the inquiries have been ignored. So I guess another failure on the way.<p>What went wrong? The fact that I am a social outcast and need to make connections with the right people to support/market my business. Entrepreneurs like me struggle to find innovative ways to solve problems within contained niches while all the big players use their monetary assets to create new demands with little or no productivity.<p>Would you try again? Yes unfortunately this exercise keeps me busy and focused. I don't have a better way to spend the remaining years of my life.

It's sleek, I love the feel of it in my hands and the durability is great. HTC Sense is also a nice sheen on top of Android, but I hate waiting for updates while HTC battle tests the new versions of Android. I could stick with Android and get a vanilla install on a Motorola, but I haven't seen one that I like the looks of yet. Maybe I should look through the latest offerings from CES as you mentioned, but the original Droid, Droid X and Droid Pro just haven't peeked my interest.<p>Even though I'm a programmer (web developer), I'm not one to tinker with my phones so rooting and getting exactly what I want out of my Incredible doesn't appeal to me too much.<p>I suppose I'd be lying if I didn't add that there is a small protion of me that is an Apple Fanboy as well. I know their products are overpriced; I cringe at paying $100 for an extra 16gb of RAM instead of being able to pick up a cheap SD card. I also know that iOS is inferior in ways to Android, but Apple just sells it to me better than Google does somehow.<p>Realistically I don't have enough reasons to justify the switch, I really don't. But sometimes you know you want something and you just can't reason as to why.<p>I will, of course, do some more research before I decide to make a purchase.

Most of those are 1 or 2 stars and you needlessly flip through then until you get to something with some valuable rating.<p>Google fixes this issue with their algorithm based on popularity. Trip Advisor, in my opinion, is a garbage site, very confusing and cluttered. There is a reason people still buy travel guides and now ebook travel guides, because of the unreliability of search results.<p>A lot of times, especially when traveling, search engines change to local results, which might not be in the language you are looking for. Then you click on the English version and get different results. This is an attempt to standardize recommendations. Hopefully it will be like a living, breathing Lonely Planet guide accessible free of charge on the internet all the time.<p>Eventually, once the site grows, I will give incentives to the owners of the ""recommendation"" area access to update the contact information, but not the criticism, which will hopefully allow for more accurate data.<p>But yes, that is a concern.<p>I fully understand your concerns and I have wrestled with them over the years too. Yes, there are a bunch of travel blog sites, yes there are a bunch of review sites, but it isn't about who did it first, but who does it better.<p>Will I? I won't know unless I try. Can I fail? Probably, but that shouldn't stop me from trying.<p>I know people who made very lucrative businesses emulating existing companies with free data from the US census. On paper it should have failed, but it worked.<p>I see those websites as portals to information, but not aggregates. Think about Digg. What did they do? Nothing special, just post stuff you read from around the internet from the websites we all frequent. Reddit replaced it as king because it did that better (much, much better actually).<p>The idea is to improve on an existing niche. Give the people something your competition doesn't give them. Although many travelers use google for research, there is a bunch of garbage that needs to be filtered out. They do a good job, but not a great one. Do I want every hotel or restaurant listed? No, I prefer just the really good ones and provide quality control to steer people towards the must-not-miss for quality, value, or whatever.<p>One more note. When I started this project, my expectations where for every 100 people, 10 create blogs and 90 come for the information.

There is even some talk of &quot;skydiving from orbit&quot;<p>So you take a B-52 out over the ocean. At 50,000 MSL, you extend two rocket pods, point the nose straight up, and take yourself out of the atmosphere post-haste. Somewhere around 200-400,000 MSL, you roll over into a standard orbit configuration.<p>Burn about half your fuel. Once you get to where you want to go, burn the other half, reach a dead stop, then parachute into the lower atmosphere, do an engine re-start, and be on your way.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it wouldn&#x27;t be a helluva ride, but I&#x27;m failing to see the part where we couldn&#x27;t have done this 20 or 30 years ago. Perhaps the problem was that folks tried to imagine some sort of new propulsion system -- and the numbers just don&#x27;t work out. Instead of solving SCRAMJET, maybe that money would have been better spent on truly reusable rockets and high-performance, plane-rated parachutes?<p>ADD: This comment was meant to address the problem of sub-orbital flight from point A to point B, not getting completely to orbit. Both SSTO and suborbital flight were mentioned in the article. My point was that suborbital flight doesn&#x27;t have as many problems as we might think it does.",1452516931

Also, Debian tutorials are <i>Debian</i> tutorials and they should serve Debian primarily and not some third-party, but still you have all documentation on Debian wiki (and also manpages of specific packages) - you just need to do a bit of search.<p>Second: saying that Debian&#x27;s tutorials are less useful because they have specific goal of high quality - makes me really sad. Debian is community and not corporation, so to see that community has higher standard then any corporation should be praised. Also Debian&#x27;s packaging evolved over 20+ years by thousands of hackers (experts in their field) all over world in their unique collaboration. I am sure this should be taken as a pride that you can go on net an read such tutorials.<p>And really, if someone thinks he is technical but can&#x27;t read few pages of <i>not</i> so demanding tutorial, then problem is in them because in software world you evolve every day and need to read and code a lot to keep a pace. Only problem that you could say is that maybe isn&#x27;t that fun to read (because Debian wikis are old school so the sentences stretch through entire screen while today&#x27;s web is focused on centering all which makes it a bit easy to read and so on).",1452516839

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case.<p>Note that the blog post is explicitly in the context of formally verifying Rust and its stdlib. This is not something that&#x27;s necessary for a &quot;good enough&quot; guarantee that stuff works and is safe. The conclusion you can make is that formally verifying Rust is just as hard as C++ (I&#x27;m not sure I agree with this either, but it&#x27;s really irrelevant), but this doesn&#x27;t make Rust a worthless language since formal verification is not what you care about for everyday safety guarantees.<p>> If the burden of &#x27;safety&#x27; is formal proof of the entire module, then you&#x27;re (surely) no better off than using C++ and doing exactly the same thing.<p>Well, formal verification is nice, but it&#x27;s not <i>necessary</i>.<p>Take the Vec<T> interface for example. There are a couple of unsafe methods in it, and the invariant &quot;len is always a valid length&quot;. It&#x27;s easy to check if len is being modified elsewhere. It&#x27;s easy to reason about these invariants. And it&#x27;s easy to reason that it upholds the invariants that Rust expects for safe functions. <i>Formal</i> verification is harder, but practical verification is easier since it&#x27;s contained in a small surface area.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s no &quot;containment of unsafety&quot; in C++ and other languages and even practical verification can be hard especially when generics get in the way.<p>> In other words, if your rust program has any module in any dependency that has unsafe code (ie. every rust program), it is potentially unsafe, regardless of the borrow checker (because some code path may invoke a &#x27;safe&#x27; function that has not be formally verified to be safe, and results in undefined behaviour despite being safe).<p>&quot;Potentially unsafe&quot; for a very small probability.

It is possible that another solution would have worked, but when you are dealing with a two year old playing with electricity do you really want to take the chance with another options? If spanking is rare children quickly learn that to get a spank means they have crossed a no-go threshold.<p>My limited personal experience of the results of disincline (of all kinds) is that inconsistent or random discipline from a parent is worse than almost all others. Children who live in fear of being disciplined for what appears to them to be for no reason, or where their actual behaviour plays very little role in affecting the discipline they experience, fair far worse.

For example, debug_assertions mode built into rustc (enables integer overflow checking, and any `debug_assert!`s in libraries), and sanitisers/checkers designed for C/C++ such as valgrind (works with Rust), TSan and ASan (don&#x27;t yet work).",1452514126

I used to make websites around late nineties and early 00s (I was about 12-14 at the time, but was doing a surprisingly good job), but find myself a little bit lost now. So, while I&#x27;m certainly not a professional web developer now, here&#x27;s what I found useful in my small hobby projects.<p>First of all, I&#x27;m not trying to best solution — I&#x27;m pretty satisfied if my solution is just good enough. So, instead of top-notch technical quality, I aim for easy to learn tech, because I don&#x27;t have a lot of time. So, I ended up using Angular in a couple of places for the client-only web apps, and using server-rendered templates backed up by Django on others. Both are mature frameworks, and both have a lot of very valid criticisms addressed at them — by professional developers that create huge projects at scale. Which I&#x27;m not, so I don&#x27;t really care. And in terms of working with HTML, I always end up using Twitter bootstrap, which offers a reasonable amount of template elements that don&#x27;t look ugly.<p>I also tried to use different project management/automation tools like npm, grunt, bower and else — because in my main line of work I can&#x27;t live without em. However, I ended up that I have to spend too much time learning them compared with how much of my time do they save. So, now, instead of proper package management, I just copy minified sources and write a couple of makefiles and bash scripts to automate stuff instead of using JS and Web-specific tools and their special formats.<p>All of this was really hard for me, because I always feel an itch when I do not automate something that should be automated, copy code or in general, don&#x27;t dig enough to find the best practice possible. But in this particular case, because I only create sites for small hobby projects, I had to make myself give a little bit less fucks, and spend this time working on actual functionality instead.",1452513999

So it&#x27;s a bit hard to compare the US to others.<p>As to how well markets functioned wrt the 2008 crisis - one question concerns credit rating agencies. If you believe that they didn&#x27;t do their jobs well, then it should be troubling that they didn&#x27;t go out of business, quite the contrary, it&#x27;s the same small number of firms which still operate in this business. If you believe that they did do their jobs well, because the government bail-out resulted in most junk debt being repaid to creditors, then you essentially don&#x27;t believe that markets function very well, as they seem to have made a correct calculation that they can extract money out of taxpayers through this junk paper, and that is not what any economist would praise as markets functioning for the benefit of society.<p>(Two counterarguments to the above that I heard are, the government caused the housing bubble in the first place, or alternatively the government helped smooth/stabilize asset prices, including housing prices, which is a proper use of monetary policy, and the paper was never &quot;really&quot; junk since housing prices rebounded later. Dean Baker argues against the latter based essentially on buying homes getting costlier relatively to renting them in bubble years. The former counterargument is voiced more rarely which is perhaps why I haven&#x27;t heard a counter-counterargument. Anyway, I think this whole thing is a bit muddy...)",1452513799

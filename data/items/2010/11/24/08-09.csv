Pick a project thats of interest to you and start contributing documentation, patches, tests etc. Be open to review feedback for existing project devs. You will lean a lot and have fun in the process.<p>What to read would be related to what project interests you. If the project needs C, read up on that. If it needs Python/Perl/Ruby read up on that. Something like 'The Art of Unix Programming' (<a href=""http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/</a>) is always useful.<p>Good luck :-)",1290589191

What Heinlein calls ""to grok"".<p>Here's a puzzle in the spirit of building the series of logical gates by combining NAND gates. You could learn enough about the concepts using wikipedia. Consider a scenario: the government bans short-selling. Your task: find a way you could synthesise a short using just forwards.<p>What are some practical considerations that might make it less practical to do this than pre-ban shorting?<p>I find that when I understand how something emerged, I have a good feel for it. A lot of these concepts go back a long way - stock practices that developed through trading stock of the dutch east india company. For this reason, I'd recommend Niall Ferguson, _The Ascent of Money_. Das _Traders, Guns and Money_ is a good read. I couldn't follow all of it when I read it, but found it to be good for feel.<p>There's a late 20th century writer John Kenneth Galbraith who wrote some good histories. I like _the end of uncertainty_ but it's hard to get. He wrote others that will be fine.<p>It would probably be useful to read a book about Drexel Burnham Lambert, and how Milken developed their junk bond trades. I don't know of one, perhaps someone else can recommend.<p>For broader economic picture stuff, I recommend Hazlitt _Economics in One Lesson_; Schiff _How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes_; Soros, _The New Paradigm for Financial Markets: The Credit Crisis of 2008 and What It Means_.",1290586246

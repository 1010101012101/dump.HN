Anything else and it feels a little pointless.<p>That said, there are a million good reasons to access that social graph.  We wanted to use it so that when you signed up to our site, we could see which companies your friends had worked at in the present/past, and thus show you jobs your friends may be able to refer you to.  Since FB didn't accept us to their program, we had to build the connection infrastructure from scratch which a) sucked up a lot of time and resources and b) will never be as successful as using an existing network.",1229039741

395083,comment,394934,394934,0,0,mdasen,,,"I'm not so sure about FBConnect.  The author says that it makes it easier to launch since you don't have to build a registration system.  Well, that's true, but you do have to hook into FBConnect which (for me) would be just as much if not more work.<p>The author similarly leaves out what I think are the most important pitfalls.  Namely, that Facebook can simply decide to end FBConnect at anytime or make it so much less usable (like they did to applications) that it essentially kills you.  The more users you get, the more valuable that data is, but with FBConnect you only have that data so long as you're on Facebook's good graces.  Since you don't have any identifier (email, username, etc.) if Facebook terminates FBConnect, you may still have the rows in the database, but now they're not mapped to anyone since you no longer have access to Facebook.<p>Likewise, the more data you give Facebook, the more of a business advantage you give them should they ever decide that your time is over.  They can easily track what sites are hot, how users use the applications based on what gets posted to walls, etc.  Then they can run you out of business with something better integrated - like they did with some apps.<p>Without email addresses, you can't contact users.  I hate sites that constantly spam me, but some email is valuable.<p>Finally, you're saying that your site isn't good enough for users to spend the time to open an account there.  If you've made something good, your pitch shouldn't be, ""well, it's really only worth using because you don't have to put in a new password.""  If you aren't getting an email from that person, then a registration is no-hassle (like here at HN).  I put in a username and repeat a password twice (nearly as easy as logging in).<p>FBConnect really just looks like an attempt by Facebook to lock out competition both in the social network arena as well as the application arena.  They can easily target your users for their own replacement of your site, they're getting your data on what's popular, they're in a position to shut you down should you impact their business plans.",1229039547

395041,comment,394609,394609,0,0,lsc,,,"I guess I also get pretty bored with jobs after a year or two.  It's funny, though, I have been running this business for quite a bit longer than that, and it's not boring.  I think the boring parts of the dayjob are the stupid that I can't change.   I mean, sure, there is stupid at my company, too-  sometimes a lot of stupid.  but it's <i>my</i> stupid, and I'm allowed to figure out how to fix it.<p>I think most of us are working towards a point where we can choose what we spend our time on.   Me, I'm currently working a full-time contract gig for the money, and then coming home, working on my book and my hosting company.   The book is winding down, and the hosting company, well, I might not be an awesome manager, but I do seem to be pretty good at finding and hiring underemployed people who turn out to be quite good.  (as confirmed by the salaries they command when they leave my company.)  so I do have good help.<p>Obviously, I'm not to the point where I have less 'forced work' -  in fact, I'm doing the opposite.  Right now, I'm working way more hours than would provide maximum effectiveness (I think it's been more than a month since I've had a week with less than 80 hours.)  I keep my productivity from going negative by switching tasks often and outsourcing many things normal people do themselves (for example, I pay someone to clean out my house once a week.  It costs me $15/hr, and she's much faster than I am.  Being as I bill out north of $70/hr even in my current state, it's a good deal) but it's still completely unsustainable, and there's one guy working for me that I lean on way too much.  If he quits before I expect him to (usually people stick with me for around a year)  I am so fucked.<p>I don't see these 80 hour weeks as a good thing;  they are, in fact, really stupid.  I'd almost certainly get more done if I could cut it down to 60.    But the book needs to get out soon... the publisher is getting antsy, and already Xen has changed so much we have to rewrite parts.    And the hosting company, well, that's kindof the point here.  that's why I'm putting up with this other crap, so I can't put it on hold.<p>I figure after the book is out (assuming the hosting company keeps improving as it has been)  I'll be able to cut my consulting hours, relying on the credibility of being published to reduce some of the marketing effort.<p>If I had to do it over again, I would have set things up so that I could support myself on a part time job, and grown the hosting company more slowly, so it could also be supported by that part-time job.<p>But I do find work, even work for other people  to be pretty interesting for the first 6months or a year.  This actually works out pretty well for me as a contractor.   I mean, if you want someone for longer than six or twelve months, you shouldn't be using contractors anyhow, so nobody get's bent out of shape if I want to leave around that time.<p>If I didn't have the entrepreneurial bug,   I'd probably work as a contractor for three to six months out of the year, and read (or write) the rest of the time.   Especially if you spent your working time in the bay area and your relaxing time somewhere cheaper, you could live  pretty nicely that way.",1229037921

395028,comment,394442,394746,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>distributed anything is usually hard for people to wrap their heads around the first time.</i><p>I don't think that's necessarily so. Have you ever tried to get an office full of people to collaboratively author a Word document? What's their instinctive behavior? They all grab copies. Then each of them hacks away on their copies. Sometimes two or three of them email their hacked copies to each other and mash them up, using cut and paste. Eventually some poor SOB has to get everyone to email over their individual versions so he can merge them. Hopefully they've all been using Track Changes (which is, in a sense, a poor man's facsimile of a single-document DVCS!); otherwise it's an even bigger clusterfuck.<p>That's a distributed model. Ever since the invention of photocopiers and email attachments, people have had to develop a very good understanding of how that model works, and how it fails.<p>It's tempting to think that the way to sort this out is to centralize it. But in my experience, centralized document-management systems are <i>not</i> that intuitive, which drives people to secretly work around them. (""Why can't I save my changed document on the shared drive? Oh, no, Joe checked it out and then went on eight-week vacation! I'll just stash my edited version on my local drive and distribute it via email."" Or, ""I created an alternate version of the doc, but I don't dare upload it to the shared drive because I might make another mistake and overwrite the official version. That always makes the admin really mad. So here it is on this USB stick."")<p>I think the most confusing aspects of version control are the navigation of history (just look at the wacky extreme that Apple' Time Machine designers went to in order to make it very obvious that you're looking backwards in history), and merging, particularly merge conflicts. But those aren't special features of DVCS; they're tricky no matter which VCS you use.",1229037195

You can then move on and do something else (with higher chance of success) but now that's eight years of working longer hours vs. four and so on.<p>That's not to say you shouldn't start a business (I certainly want to start my own at one point or another), you just can't hope that it will magically solve your problems.<p>I've been reading Thoreau's Walden, where he mentions a Native American basket salesman who would argue when selling his baskets: ""if you don't buy my basket, my people will starve""; Thoreau then argued that it isn't ""how to better sell a basket"" that the salesman should worry about but how to avoid relying on selling baskets not to starve.<p>Likewise, instead of thinking ""how can I generate passive income for myself so I don't have to work"" start thinking ""how can I structure my work/life that I don't need a passive income to be happy and productive"" (it could be reducing your living standards down to the basics where only consulting/part-time work is needed, it could be finding an area in which you're more excited to work - and if you can't find a job in that area, create one for yourself).",1229037190

In reality, the security quality of a typical web application is quite low, especially compared to F500 enterprise standards --- few would survive a pentest.

This is a niche that isn't well served yet.  YouPorn and the like is a grab-bag of short clips --  You can rummage around and find good content, but isn't a  place where you can just go, press a button, and know you'll get something with good content, tailored to your tastes, with high quality sound and video, instantly the first time.  An application that presented tailored ""channels"" as a TiVo-like application would stand to make a lot of money.<p>Studios and other porn content producers would like this if it could guarantee them a payment for their content, provide data on the viewing habits of users, and add user interfaces so that a consumer could click a button to buy a DVD or other product.",1229036678

We have baggage...family, dog, lives outside of our company, etc.  I kinda doubt several of the most successful YC companies would have signed on at all for such an intense sort of experience.<p>Beyond the basic expenses of buying a hotel in the valley (I think the cost is being underestimated, even in this economic climate), the expenses of operating it are going to be very high, even without staffing it as a hotel.  It's obviously a mandatory expense, and everyone needs somewhere to live, but you're not going to save a huge amount of money over individuals placing themselves in their own apartment or house.  And, more importantly you're going to self-select out of being able to fund any company that doesn't exactly fit the stereotype: Fresh out of college, no family, not from the area and thus not already settled somewhere in the valley, not needing to have a presence outside of the valley for business reasons, etc.<p>This is one of those things that sounds cool, but I think it takes the simple, and obviously successful, kernel of YC and adds a non-essential boondoggle that doesn't actually improve on the model.<p>I believe the solution to the ""what happens after"" shouldn't be ""make sure the founders never have to think about after by infantilizing them and making sure they never have to think about necessities"", but instead should be ""make sure the founders are well-prepared for after"".  After is going to come eventually, if the company is to be a success.",1229036498

I was thinking about a much smaller, suburban district and the average there is probably closer to $50k.<p>And yes, starting salaries are much lower-- as they are for most graduates in most other industries.<p>I wasn't arguing that being a teacher is going to get you rich.  But at least in NY, one makes enough to live comfortably.  If you can handle dealing with kids on a daily basis, it isn't a bad career choice at all.

472096,comment,472001,472001,0,0,CalmQuiet,,,"James Duncan Davis' description of assault at TED2009 is harrowing, because it could have ended <i>much</i> worse and because it wasn't associated with a particularly risky behavior on his part. One single person rabid enough about getting into TED that he would manhandle and persist in trying to get Davis' TED badge despite vigorous struggle and loud screaming... also makes you aware Davis was at much greater risk if it had been <i>two</i> assailants or a knife/gun weilding one.<p>Really a shame that common strategies such as walking in groups after dark (always urged at LA conferences I've been to) are important in Long Beach and at ""A place where great thinkers and optimists gather.""  Sure glad his person, wallet & photog gear as well as his TED badge ended up safe.  <i>Not</i> pleased that the crazed attacker was not apprehended and may <i>not</i> have learned a lesson from his unsuccessful attack.",1234092656
472095,comment,471660,471660,0,0,conskeptical,,,"Maybe there's an assumption here that identity has to be constant. If we erase that assumption and accept our identities as a continuous transformation throughout our lives... :<p>Perhaps keeping your identity flexible can be better at protecting against useless discussion. And the key thing above any consideration of identity is to focus on receive as well as transmit, and to remember to couple the two with some sort of processing. The key point about identity isn't particularly its size, but its flexibility.<p>A small, inflexible identity is simply a harder target to hit, but when you hit it you'll still find useless discussions there.
A large, flexible identity is easy to hit, but when you hit it, you're very likely to find interesting discussions.
A small, flexible identity is hard to interest, discussions will fizzle uninterestingly long before the religious war, unless you happen to hit the right topic in which case you'll find a good discussion.
A large, inflexible identity is easy to hit and the main cause of pointless discussions.<p>The best discussions are where flexible identities meet, regardless of their size. A useless discussion is one where the participants come away unchanged. A good discussion is one where the participants come away changed (ie, with something that they didn't have before). You need to be flexible for that.<p>Of course, there is such a thing as being too flexible...",1234092595

Since no one can be proven wrong, every opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with theirs.""<p>Mentioning this view should always, I think, be accompanied by a disclaimer.  As Michael Rooney wrote:  ""The error here is similar to one I see all the time in beginning philosophy students: when confronted with reasons to be skeptics, they instead become relativists.

There are so many times I've wanted to know something more, and thanks to Google I can -- quickly and easily.  My brain retains all these breadcrumbs, and I am able to recall them fairly easily.  I'd argue that such ready availability of knowledge is increasing our breadth, perhaps to some detriment of depth, but I still think that's a net win.  If I need the depth, I can get it easily, and retain it for the task-at-hand.<p>The article also assumes we hand over our critical thinking skills to the likes of Google, which is obviously a fallacy.",1234091846

472083,comment,471660,471660,0,0,Create,,,"I think pg is entirely missing the point: it isn't about identity. It is about [exercising] power, and its subjects. Identity, like technology (mentioned javascript) is just a tool for it.<p>He might like <a href=""http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2733964"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2733964</a> (it is available in several languages) -- it explains the obvious: religious wars are in fact not about religion, neither identity. To most, even believing people, it does not matter for the faith, if the body and blood are actually present in the Eucharist or not. This is more of a pretext, an artificially created differentiation [marketing, PR if you like] to create identity, to exhibit disagreement [over other issues]. In the end, it is nothing more than struggle over control/power/resources.

472079,comment,471660,471660,0,0,cturner,,,"I've been very interested in this essay and the thread on defiance as a survival mechanism.<p>I've reached an ""all code is data moment"" though on the 'ideology' thing. If we dedicate ourselves to task then in order to do a good job of it we often need to buy into it with identity. For cleaning the dishes we wouldn't, but for designing something new we definitely do. There are controversial value judgements all over the place, and you often have to build on decision mechanisms that are a hell of a lot more vague than scientific conclusions when you do it. Hence, you are invested an ideology, both in terms of approach and belief.<p>Two things get you into real trouble. One is to stake a lot on something tenuous. If you have a design pattern idea that is very tenous, and then invest in building a system on top of it, you're probably in trouble. Been there, and i got prickly at suggestions that my base was not all that solid.<p>The other problem is when you have a belief system that is getting driven from somewhere else. Politics is the nasty one because you're forced to subscribe and it's about the group. Though I personally believe that strict property law is sacred, that most taxation is stealing and that public education is a poor model, the only options on offer are those that accept that and so I have to pick one. What's worse still is that politics is a zero sum game. When your solution wins, my bad compromise loses. It hurts a lot more if you openly share your faith that your chosen pick is a good one.<p>The political systems that are most notorious for hijacking casual conversations are those that are based on the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in society, because the stakes are a lot higher for people in that perspective.<p>Politics can be made worse by some vote electoral decision systems. One bad design is to base it on a winner takes all rule with no preferences. This can be made worse still with a gerrymander electorate. But - at least that ensures you get catch-all parties. Worse still is to give everyone a piece of the pie like the Israeli or old Italian system. In those systems every lobby group has its own political presence, there's less reason to govern for the all rather than your group, and this sets the stage for coruption and a perpetually unstable executive. Vague idea: a political system with a fixed 'kernel' but an arbitrary number of representatives who would be self-funded by bits of the community.<p>Religion is less of a problem than politics. You can have a conversation with someone about the ancestry of your different religions and respect their position openly <i>and inside</i> even if you do spare a moment later to have a private chuckle at the prospect of their eternity in the fiery pit. Hey - it's their funeral. Some cultures try to turn religion into politics: old testament stories that say that God punished a town because its people were bad, or that certain land must be reclaimed for the one true faith, or network marketing rules.<p>The problems are far less in the geek world and they decline as time goes on and tools get better making the compromises less. I suspect that normal people got more upset about mac-windows ten years ago than now, and that they get more upset now than than hackers, because they're victims of the compromises whereas experienced developers don't give a damn what platform they're on so long as they can get a shell and a compiler.<p>Although... everyone needs libraries...<p>Something that would be useful: tips on forming a world view with minimal reliance on external belief.",1234091004

10939983,comment,10938593,10939292,0,0,VLM,,,"For better or worse (mostly the latter) we pretend to have separation of church and state, but certainly do not.<p>Being reminded of this, manages to deeply offend many people on both sides.  If we don&#x27;t talk about it, its not a problem, right? (LOL)<p>So, like it or not, government marriage = Christian marriage and Christians are going to be really offended at the government redefinition of their religious institution.  Just like Jews would be annoyed if the IRS enforced changes in the Bar Mitzvah or the FAA decided to enforce changes in the Mormon baptism for the dead ritual.<p>The gay marriage people really screwed up there, intentionally or not.  Should have done it in two far less controversial steps, one step to get the government once and for all out of the church, and then once church and state are separated, there would be no religious component to changing the state definition of marriage, much as there&#x27;s very little religious animosity on the topic of obscure trust inheritance law or modifications to building codes.<p>Gay people seem to have little empathy for religious people.  I&#x27;m not religious and even I have more empathy for them than the gay people do.  I can assure you Christians believe in their religion just as strongly as progressives believe in their religion of progressivism.",1453312790

There was no blood under the hood, so obviously there was a difference source for that DNA.<p>The key to the car was found in Avery&#x27;s room in clear sight (after it had been searched 7 times already). The key was scrubbed clean, and only Avery&#x27;s DNA was present, but not blood. No fingerprints. At any point a piece of his clothing could have been used (or a toothbrush) to rub some DNA on it. Same for the car hood. Trivial to plant when you have access to somebody&#x27;s DNA. At any point during the search somebody could have picked up one of his socks, walked to the car, rubbed it wherever and walked away.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it definitely happened this way, just that it would have been easy to do for anybody with access. While the article goes to lengths to claim that the documentary leaves out important evidence, but arguments they use to support that claim don&#x27;t hold water.

For anyone who didn&#x27;t look at the page:<p>Similar to smart phone’s data plan, OneCook offers meal plan if you want. Generally, the more food packages and longer period you purchase from our platform, the lesser cost your device will be. For example an unlocked device is $299 but a 12-month meal plan makes the device cost only $99. We recommend you to use our food packages because they come paired with our ready-to-use recipe programs. It saves your time to shop, chop and prepare food. However this is optional, you can still use your own ingredients. If you select a meal plan, each week you will spend at least $25 on our food packages, which equals to 3-4 one serving meals. Of course, similar to your data plan, you can cancel your meal plan to have an unlocked device anytime you want, as long as you pay the cancellation fee depending on the rest period of your meal plan.<p>Is it not possible to cancel your meal plan?",1453312652

If I use a npm package that&#x27;s badly coded, do I blame node or npm?<p>As for the rest of your comment, I appreciate the feedback. But by complicate the matter, I mean multiple files with multiple tasks to perform on those same files that results in a single output for each original file. A simple example from a gulp task I&#x27;ve been playing with; start with a folder structure of markdown files, iterate over each getting front matter for options and then removing front matter, convert each markdown file to html, compile with front matter listed Handlebars template file, change name of file to match front matter title (although I&#x27;m thinking of skipping this step and keep original markdown file name, which means I do nothing), output to single file in a build folder but keeping original folder structure. I also have a watch task that looks for any markdown file being updated and it runs this task for me. Now, I&#x27;m assuming all this can be done without gulp, but does using gulp not help with this task?",1453312423

And then just a couple, talking about Avery.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem with the case, as I saw it (I watched the entire 10 episodes over a week).  The only physical evidence tying Avery to the murder was collected by the pair of detectives who least of everyone else were supposed to be there. How convenient!<p>Secondly, to the evidence itself: if Avery did all the throat-slashing and raping, where is the evidence?? Surely they should find <i>ONE</i> speck of blood, or hair or skin cells or something??? Avery is such a genius that he can wipe all evidence of this massacre from a carpeted, cluttered bedroom (so badly cluttered that they couldn&#x27;t find the key, sitting in plain sight, in 4 previous tries!), while leaving his own DNA around everywhere??  Same for the garage, where apparently she was shot: no blood, nothing. But there was blood from various deer carcasses of the past!<p>And don&#x27;t even get me started on the key! His DNA is on it ... but not hers, even though she drove it?!? And why is it the valet key? And how come the two suspect detectives immediately recognized it was the &quot;right&quot; key, even though they were in a f&#x27;in junkyard with a 1000 vehicles around?<p>And his blood in the vehicle: even if you accept that it&#x27;s his blood, where are the fingerprints?? Oh right: when it came to fingerprints, he was wearing a glove. Which, conveniently once again, allowed the blood to seep through in the right places.<p>The author uses Brendan&#x27;s statement that he helped his uncle put the body in the RAV4, hence the &quot;sweat DNA&quot;, <i>AFTER</i> admitting that the confession was fake!  Anyone who has watched the &quot;confession&quot; would be left with boiling rage at the interrogators.<p>And she doesn&#x27;t mention Len Kachinsky, the public &quot;defender&quot; who effectively railroaded Brendan?<p>I could go on and on, but this article is pure drivel.",1453312407

Unfortunately detecting these very distant objects is very difficult.  The light we see from them is reflected light from the Sun, so their apparent brightness goes as 1/r^4, not 1/r^2 like most objects.  And because they are so close, there is a strong parallax from the motion of the Earth.  THe consequence from this is that the object will actually drift across the image as you are taking it, smearing it out.  In order to detect it you either have to take very short images so that it doesn&#x27;t move too much (in which case you don&#x27;t get very much light), or have some idea as to the direction of the smear so that you can correct for it.  Either way it&#x27;s a very hard observation to make!  Fortunately if this planet is as big as they claim it to be it should be relatively easy to detect compared to Sedna and the other Kuiper Belt objects.",1453311777

The development experience is great. I haven&#x27;t been this happy and impressed since rails .9 ripping me a new case of programming love.<p>Look, meteor has it&#x27;s downfalls but so does any stack. There&#x27;s nothing working against you, it&#x27;s all just code. There&#x27;s no magic. You don&#x27;t understand subscriptions, merge box, and how to handle joins? Level up a little bit. It&#x27;s not a hard thing to figure out. Open source code makes it easy to dig in.<p>Yes, mongo is looked at in bad light, it&#x27;s also incredibly powerful when used right. The trick is to not be oblivious to the tools you use and work around it when it matters.<p>The most important thing for a product, startup, and company is the ability to make the right calls and grow at the right time and then be able to handle and accommodate problematic areas when you need to.<p>Does meteor scale? Yes. Does it have a theoretical limit? Yes. The trick there is to be cognizant of the limit and plan around it when you are approaching.<p>It&#x27;s all just JavaScript at the end of the day.<p>Oh you want to scale out your processing? Easy. Fan out some back end nodes in whatever language you want. Pull from mongo, do your crunching, and then feed it back in. Then meteor will sync it to all clients. This is pretty powerful. You can completely swap out and fan pieces out with meteor.<p>We have a massive app in meteor. It&#x27;s also architected to be modular if we have to break it up.<p>The isomorphic nature of the code base has created pleasant APIs on both the front end and back end and has drastically simplified a real time app experience. Meteor sets a new standard for web applications and demands new perspectives. When you embrace it you get an ecosystem that is quite revolutionary to work with. Everything from the web-app, latency compensation, pub/sub, down to Cordova builds.<p>Overall, we are very happy. Yes things can be better, and we are looking forward to seeing meteor evolve.<p>Meteor shouldn&#x27;t focus on supporting new view frameworks like blaze vs react. Just focus on adopting the tools out there and making it better. That&#x27;s why meteor doesn&#x27;t need blaze. Meteor doesn&#x27;t need a router. Meteor should pick the best open source versions of that in the Js community and make it easy to work with inline with the &quot;vision&quot;. Meteor should focus on the developer UX. This is their power. An opinionated framework that removes the stress of configuration and has tools that fit really well together to allow an individual, team, and company to focus on building what matters: features.<p>The vision is grand and I believe it in and I&#x27;m also not worried about scale. People said the same shit about rails, and x, y, z. Scale is a good problem to have and when you have that problem you&#x27;ll figure out what you have to do.<p>If anyone has any questions about meteor architecture feel free to ping me.<p>---",1453311761

While I fully agree with that (as a lawyer), I think ordinary peoples&#x27; view of the justice system is a bit different.<p>Watch the beginning of the 1983 Michael Douglas movie, &quot;Star Chamber.&quot; The first scenes show two men getting away with the rape and murder of a young boy, because the damning piece of evidence (a bloody shoe), was found in their van pursuant to a search in violation of the 4th amendment. The audience is supposed to be outraged by this failure of justice.<p>Surely you&#x27;ve heard the consternation about criminals &quot;getting off on a technicality.&quot; A lot of people view procedural protections as just that: technicalities. It&#x27;s people with that mindset reacting so negatively to this documentary. To them, Avery&#x27;s actual guilt or innocence is the important thing. The process is just technicalities.<p>The same mindset makes it easy to justify police misconduct, and I imagine it was strongly at work with Avery&#x27;s jury. Once you admit the evidence excluded in the documentary, such as Avery&#x27;s prior conduct, it becomes quite reasonable to conclude that Avery is actually guilty. At the same time, with the &quot;planted blood&quot; theory seemingly debunked by the FBI test, the only blatantly obvious police misconduct you&#x27;re left with is the planted key. If you view outcome as being more important than process, it&#x27;s very easy to think of finding Avery innocent based on the planted key as simply letting him off on a &quot;technicality.&quot;<p>[1] Not to mention the pervasive logical and legal fallacies in Ken Kratz&#x27;s statements, which left me yelling at the TV.",1453311194

Similarly they&#x27;re often accused of bias for not reporting something, or very carefully reporting something, that either side believe to be fact, but where there&#x27;s not (yet) actual firm evidence. Of course, if done &quot;against&quot; just one side, this too would be actual bias, but the BBC appears to be pretty consistent about it.<p>So we&#x27;re left with reporting that is rarely very biased, but often exceedingly unsatisfying for everyone.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s no bias - I don&#x27;t believe that would be possible.

Micropayments would fix that if I could pay one company a $5/mo subscription to then have payments automatically dolled out to a select list of good sites until my $5 was used up (then maybe ask me each time after that, or something).<p>(3) They talk about avoiding the ad-blocking war, but they are just contributing to it. I guess what they think is that by making a way for the website owner to get paid they avoid some of the war, but many companies like to be in direct control of their money so they might not like a middleman sitting on the high way charging everyone a tax to pass. And if Brave doesn&#x27;t charge something for its services then it has no business model, so I&#x27;m assuming they are not passing 100% of revenue on to the site owner.",1453310367

That doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t try to prevent their deaths.<p>These days we&#x27;ve done most of the easy/cheap things we can do to prevent human deaths; there are few low-hanging fruit left. So anything we can do to save lives will be expensive and/or involve sacrificing useful things. IMO gun laws are one of the cheaper ways to save lives that remain available (I&#x27;d also advocate making driving tests stricter, repealing jaywalking laws and adding an assumption of liability when a driver injures a pedestrian).",1453310061

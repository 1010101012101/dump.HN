4049711,comment,4048061,4048598,2,0,jdlshore,,,"It's not quite <i>that</i> simple. Primitive obsession is a form of duplication, and it's particularly difficult to spot without practice. Once found, it can be a real bear to remove. Chapter 4 of my screencast [1] shows this; it took me an hour and a half to refactor a trivial application to remove its primitive obsession. (And there's strong case to be made that some of the difficulty I had in earlier episodes was due to primitive obsession as well.)<p>I agree that premature abstraction is a pain, too, so I wouldn't want to go down that route. However, preventing primitive obsession can be as trivial as using a two-method wrapper class. More methods and abstraction can be added on an as-needed basis. Also, removing the wrapper class is automatable with the ""Inline Method"" refactoring in some IDEs.<p>So the design tradeoffs I see are:<p>1- Primitive obsession: high duplication burden, high complexity burden, hard to remove<p>2- Wrapping primitives that don't need it: low complexity burden, easy to remove<p>So I prefer to error on the side of wrapping primitives. That said, I've never actually encountered a case where I wrapped a primitive that didn't need it, and I still accidentally create the primitive obsession smell a lot. It seems so innocuous at first.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play/</a>",1338490565

Facebook is not in the business of running a social network -- most of their revenue comes from selling ads. Their customers are advertisers, not their users. Their competitor is not really the puny Google Plus, it's the mighty Google AdWords.

But somewhat relevant to your question, in my experience, the passage of time can go rather strangely in dreams.  As one example of weirdness, if I start to do something like count to twenty, it would be rather easy for me to start counting, then have the dream kind of, almost or perhaps entirely imperceptibly, ""skip"", and I'm saying twenty with plenty of memories that I did the counting if I try to remember the middle, but never having actually done so--in whatever best sense that phrase works for dreams--.  That is to say, memories seem to me like just another sense channel that the dream world can fake in realistic or shoddy fidelity as the case may be.<p>So how would you know if you really thought through designing some software ""beginning to end"" so to speak, actually considering sub-cases, instead of having just skipped to feeling like you did all that when really your dreamworld is just elaborating its first guess at a design on the fly as you look at one facet or another.  Now in some cases, that distinction might not matter, in which case I'd say a LD might be what you are looking for.  In other cases, it will matter, and I'd say dream worlds can be tricky (another important way here is that one's ""criticality"" is not usually up to par in dreams, normally glaring problems, omissions, strangeness can just glide by one's attention; one is usually better at this in LD but not anything like infallibly so).<p>Now the interpersonal relationship thing... that I have more directly tested.  And instead of sitting and trying to use dream-time to ponder the matter, LDing provides a different sort of possibly useful trick; calling up simulation(s) of the person in question and chatting with them while their dispositions are somewhat under your control.

Those implementation patterns would be relatively easy to generically wrap into the kind of callback pattern used by Node.js.<p>At the very least, a project like this has a possibility of highlighting some of the places where only blocking APIs have been provided but non-blocking ones should have also been provided. On a slightly more optimistic note, a project like this has a chance of allowing more solutions to be built in the Node.js events-instead-of-threads style without having to jump ship to an entirely different runtime.",1274675983

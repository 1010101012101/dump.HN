The first is that for at least the first half of the 20th century the U.S. population on average was probably substantially wealthier than European counterparts (European countries make up a substantial part of the OECD).  The second is that the civilian population of much of Europe suffered much more during World War II.

A domain name was an identifier that could be requested as needed, and in return for payment of a nominal fee would be delegated to the requester. The requester should then, if following netiquette, relinquish the identifier when no longer needed.<p>If instead the initial registration was taken as the sale of a commodity, the original way they were distributed didn&#x27;t make a lot of sense. It would&#x27;ve made more sense to auction them off at fair market value, rather than registering new domains first-come/first-serve for a nominal fee.<p>I suppose that ship has long since sailed, though a few ccTLDs still retain that position, at least officially. DK Hostmaster&#x27;s policy statement says that <i>Domain names cannot be purchased, but borrowed. In other words, by registering a .dk domain name, you have acquired the right to use it.</i> However they&#x27;ve given up trying to enforce that, and allow this &quot;right to use&quot; to be fully transferable, making it quasi-property.

7019247,comment,7016153,7016769,2,0,gsnedders,,,"Spec writing is only half the challenge (and arguably a relatively easy one!).<p>A big problem with HTML and HTTP is the fact that error handling has always been undefined (the current HTML spec is the first real attempt to define error handling!) — so different people implement different things, and then when you end up with a single implementation with ~90% marketshare, everyone has to reverse-engineer that (and probably not perfectly!). Combine this with the fact that the majority of implementers of HTML and (to a only slightly less extent) HTTP are web developers who just want to get stuff working — they&#x27;ve never read a page of the spec in their life. So, guess what, they end up relying upon client&#x27;s error-handling (typically the intersection of clients they care about — which when IE had 90%+ marketshare was often just IE, then see above about reverse-engineering).<p>The other big problem is the lack of generic test suites for the standards — far too often each implementer ends up writing their own tests, and then not sharing them (the IETF still has no real general infrastructure for hosting testsuites for RFCs!). At least around the W3C, there&#x27;s been a relatively large movement in the past three years or thereabouts towards developing shared testsuites, in large part down to various Microsoft and Opera people (myself included, in the early days, as a disclaimer) and several WG chairs (trying to push specs to REC — which nowadays requires two interoperable implementations, and hence practically a testsuite), so things are at least slowly changing there. But there&#x27;s still a lot of work to be done — and it&#x27;s one area where improvements can have large effects, as it increases the consistency of all implementations, and makes it easier for smaller, and newer, competitors to enter the market.",1389122664

7019184,comment,7017222,7017222,3,0,zavulon,,,"I wrote a blog post about this back in 2005, when Hostel was coming out. It seems that&#x27;s right about our fascination with torture on TV has started. While I cringe at my writing from 9 years ago, it seems like things have only gotten worse since then.<p>> With seemingly inevitable theatrical success of &#x27;Hostel&#x27; and recent mainstream movies such as &#x27;Passion of the Christ&#x27; and &#x27;Sin City&#x27; reveling in accurately depicting violence and torture, I started thinking what does that say about our society and what horrors are next in line for the viewers, hungry for more blood and suffering. And then it dawned on me - almost this exact situation was already predicted, in a dystopian 1966 sci-fi story by Robert Silverberg called &#x27;The Pain Peddlers&#x27;.<p>> &#x27;The Pain Peddlers&#x27; depicts a scary, bleak and sarcastic view of the future - in the early 00&#x27;s, television is king. And what brings most money to TV networks is live surgery. In the story, the main character is a TV producer who got a very promising prospect - an old man suffering from gangrene and a family, too broke to take care of the hospital bill. The old man needs to have his leg amputated, and the family agreed to do it on live TV. It&#x27;s the producer&#x27;s job to convince the family to have the amputation without anesthesia - for more money, of course. Nothing brings in the viewers quite like real human agony.<p>> Remembering this story, which I read long time ago, was a very scary experience for me, because... in 1966, when it was written, it was pure fantasy - the notion of something like that actually happening never occurred to Silverberg or his contemporaries. But does it sound that incredible now? With TV viewers getting tired of same-old reality shows and public&#x27;s growing hunger for violence, how long until a new reality show depicting real surgery appears on, say, HBO? Probably not right away. But I can definitely see something like that happening, not too far away in the future.",1389122104

To answer a few questions I&#x27;ve seen, it uses a typical captive portal approach, so an unencrypted WiFi hotspot.  Upon connection, you are redirected to an encrypted site with embedded Facebook account verification, at which point you can go wherever the Internet service lets you.  The router typically has content filtering and also tracks Internet usage (bandwidth, visited sites, etc) as well as limits on visit length etc.<p>It is a useful option for merchants, as customers expect WiFi for free.  Further, they expect it to be fast and that doesn&#x27;t expose them to security risks.  In other words, this gets expensive and difficult to manage.  There are great solutions out there already, but they cost money - so the business case is based on marketing data.  Email authentication would work, but it is difficult to gain much insight about customers, also you would need to give people access to their email server to setup their authentication.  SMS doesn&#x27;t work for people who don&#x27;t have cell phones, or if there is poor coverage - also marketing data would be very difficult to gain.  So, Social Media authentication (Facebook) turns out to be a really great option.<p>Obviously you have the choice not to use the service, but this isn&#x27;t going away.  Industry codes of conduct need to be set and I don&#x27;t think they have.  Privacy laws need to be understood and enforced.

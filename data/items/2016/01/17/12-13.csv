The thing is, though, some of the stuff I work in is sold to customers who expect it to work for more than five minutes, and it&#x27;s been sold with indications of how long support will be provided as standard and options for enhanced support contracts and so on. So we have an <i>obligation</i> to support older versions for a significant period, because <i>that&#x27;s what our customers were buying</i>.<p>It&#x27;s true that we focus on the latest version for new features, but sometimes we also provide them on the previous generation, and pretty much everyone gets updates if there&#x27;s a major security issue regardless of the age of their system. This arrangement is inconvenient at times from our point of view, but it doesn&#x27;t concern us unduly because supporting long-standing customers is the cost of doing business with professionals. We find customers tend to move to our newer products naturally over time anyway, because the newer versions are significantly better in ways that our customers actually want.<p><i>The &quot;legacy systems&quot; explanation of maintaining outdated software is vanishing with the rise of the modern web browser and the cloud. The local machine has less and less responsibility to run anything beyond a browser.</i><p>That&#x27;s a very narrow perspective. Web apps are all very trendy around HN, but the vast majority of business software is still running client-side. Microsoft had better hope it stays that way, too, because otherwise no-one has any reason to use either Windows or Office any more, in which case it might be a good time to start shorting Microsoft stock.<p><i>Progress marches on, and at an ever quickening pace.</i><p>You and I have very different understandings of what constitutes progress. Personally, things moving around in UIs all the time drives me crazy. From a business perspective, the concerns about security and confidentiality that arise with online services often far outweigh any benefit they might provide. And from both perspectives, the trend towards software phoning home or running remotely generally makes everything less reliable than it used to be. This isn&#x27;t progress, it&#x27;s a new low on several different fronts.",1453034528

So I&#x27;m kind of okay with failing to run destructors due to deadlock or process exit, but not okay with leaking a cycle. Is that a sensible distinction, or is the situation even more subtle?</i><p>I think that&#x27;s a reasonable distinction, but, at least for deadlocks, I&#x27;m not sure it is enough to have all the guarantees one might want (particularly around multithreading/scoping). Then again, it might be.<p><i>> 2) How do I make a cycle with Mutex and RWLock?</i><p>The same as a RefCell, just call `.lock().unwrap()` and `.write().unwrap()` instead of `.borrow_mut()`. These two types are essentially the same as a RefCell, just with more synchronisation, and fewer panics. They can block and wait for another thread to finish, at the risk of deadlocks of course, while a RefCell is restricted to a single thread, so blocking would just dead lock a thread with itself, hence a panic resolves the situation better. In fact, other than this blocking/panicking distinction, a RwLock and RefCell are almost identical: .read == .borrow and .write == .borrow_mut.<p>Here&#x27;s a demo which creates cycles that contain a type that prints in the destructor (demonstrating that they don&#x27;t run): <a href=""https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=6ea16b859e22f57fee14&version=stable&run=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=6ea16b859e22f57fee14&versio...</a><p><i>> 3) I don&#x27;t completely understand the queue example, what exactly is the magic that allows self-reference? </i><p>This is also essentially the same as the core RefCell/Mutex example, replacing .borrow_mut()/.lock() with .send. An mpmc Queue<T> will be isomorphic to Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<T>>> (although unlikely to be implemented as such in practice). The key is that they will reference-count the book-keeping that needs to be shared among all handles (like the start/tail of the queue), which allows creating a reference cycle.",1453034485

If everyone on earth had the same equal piece of land then it can be argued that the tax rate (as property taxes are) would not be on the income but fixed on the basis of the size of the land.

The comment that I and rustynails replied to added absolutely nothing of value and was an admonishing post suggestive that the lack of surface diversity* in our industry is largely the result of discrimination and not other factors like base rates and natural nerd proclivities.<p>The people described in the article worked as computers and mathematicians at NASA because of:<p>- talent<p>- born, raised and lived in the right place at the right time (propinquity)<p>- self interest (they applied for jobs doing work they were interested in performing)<p>- health (reasonably good enough not to be a distraction)<p>- education<p>People who worked as engineers in Silicon Valley since the mini-computer revolution have done so because of:<p>- talent<p>- born, raised and lived in the right place at the right time (propinquity)<p>- self interest (they applied for jobs doing work they were interested in performing)<p>- health (reasonably good enough not to be a distraction)<p>- education<p>Notice that those two lists are largely the same? While I&#x27;m not saying discrimination isn&#x27;t at play or non-existent, it&#x27;s at best a minor factor relative to lots of other issues. Let&#x27;s take what is likely to be one of the biggest issues that everyone loves to conveniently ignore, base rates:<p>In Hampton, Virginia, the birthplace of NASA, the African American population is 49.8% and in Virginia it&#x27;s 19.7%, whereas in the Bay Area it&#x27;s about 6.7%, most of which is largely concentrated in Alemeda, Contra Costa and Solano counties. Furthermore, these counties are not the locus of Silicon Valley, San Francisco (5.8%), San Mateo (3.0%) and Santa Clara (2.9%) are. Even the entire state of California is only about 6.5% black. This means, that to have a percentage of the Silicon Valley work force be black at approximately the same rate as the rest of the United States, black people need to move here either for work or for school.<p>As someone who&#x27;s moved countries 4 times and states 2 times, this is non-trivial and unpleasant for those without a disposition to tolerate such a jarring change where you&#x27;re an adult and responsible for supporting yourself and financing your own move. You lose support networks of family and friends. It&#x27;s a non-trivial cost, especially if you need to move belongings. You need to rebuild and re-purchase the things you didn&#x27;t bring.<p>The base rates above are the general population. If you assume that most people in tech have a bachelor degree or better (we no this isn&#x27;t universally true since many software engineers are self taught), then the base rates gets worse. For people between 25 and 29 years of age, about 20% of black people have a bachelors degree versus 15% for Hispanics, 40% for white people and 58% for Asians.<p>Furthermore, 52% of college students attend a university within 100 miles of home and only 15.5% attend a university farther than 500 miles away. And a mere ~1.5% of Americans move across state lines each year.<p>Honestly, most people debating diversity as so incredibly awful at understanding statistics and performing a basic root cause analysis. It&#x27;s like people start asking the 5 Whys, but the moment diversity is involved people&#x27;s minds automatically short circuit and jump straight to because #racism or because #patriarchy. I&#x27;m not saying neither of those contribute to the problem, but they are far from the biggest factors. There are a LOT of filters that do a lot to modify/distort the available pool of people who would get even as far as applying for a job (which is for the most part a prerequisite for discrimination, active or unconscious<i></i>)<p>Basically, if you want to make it so racial diversity in tech approximates the general population in the US, the best solution is not to try to change Silicon Valley, but to help more places like Silicon Valley exist in places with base rates that more closely match the racial distribution you believe is ideal.

It&#x27;s interesting on two levels.<p>One, the history itself is fascinating, even for somebody like me that&#x27;s generally not a big history buff. (Perhaps it helps that the episodes are short!)<p>Two, the central conceit -- snapshots of history as told via examinations of various historical artifacts -- actually changed the way I look at things around me. Every single object we hold, mundane or otherwise, holds so much information and is shaped by so many things.<p>Here&#x27;s one example I remember well: the famous &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot; print. We tend to think of it as the most quintessential Japanese print. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa</a><p>But it&#x27;s more complex and interesting than that. It actually marks a big turning point in Japanese culture, as it actually incorporates major European influences: the rich blue inks and a European use of perspective to depict the mountain in the distance. So this unmistakably Japanese print represents a crossroads...",1453032735

It took me until this year to realize that in the effort to &#x27;value&#x27; my hours, I forgot how essential and valuable it is to spend time doing things that are relaxing and that might seem unproductive at first sight.<p>It reached a point where I would often work in the weekends, forego any vacation, feel guilty about the hours I did &#x27;nothing&#x27; (out of sheer necessity), and sometimes even apply a little too much pragmatism to my friendships. I&#x27;d ask myself if the interactions were useful or somehow furthered my personal development or career, and forget that, while this is not an unimportant question, the value of a friendship can be the time spent enjoying each other&#x27;s company.<p>This important realization came after I had worked a lot, built a relatively stable career with enough clients and a good portfolio, saved up enough money to allow me to not work for at least a year. I had reached my goals, so to speak.<p>But instead of stopping work and doing things I always put off, or creating things I&#x27;d been wanting to create for a long time, I ended up with a (mild) burn-out and a severe existential crisis: now that I had nothing to really worry about, I had no clue what to do with that freedom.<p>What <i>am</i> I, and what do I enjoy doing, after years of neglecting to explore this?<p>Currently I&#x27;m working on finding more balance, and savoring the little and big things in life. But even now, I need to make sure I have some work because when I stop, my mind just kind of panics from the freedom I have. So I&#x27;m taking it one step at a time.<p>Picking up gaming again has been one of those things I savor again.",1453032731

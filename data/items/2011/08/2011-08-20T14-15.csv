Enough to get a small apartment, utilities, cell phone, cheap but unhealthy food, and shopping at the dollar store.  And free tv/movie/music/book/sports entertainment via the internet.<p>- 15% will be the middlemen, extracting value from the others via service or thievery.  They will be the new middle class.  They can afford the sometimes luxury.<p>- the other 5.5% will be specialized knowledge workers.  They will be the one maintaining the software/hardware to make sure nothing goes wrong.  They can afford lots of luxury, but will be taxed heavily, as they are the only workhorse left in the society.<p>- 0.1% will be entertainers.

Also note that I am considering replacement levels of fertility desirable.<p>This isn't as simple as that. The tax revenue used for education in Texas comes from property taxes. The majority of that is from homeowners. The overwhelming majority of homeowners have or had children in the home at some point. Aside from those facts, would you like to live in a society where the children were not educated?

The sun moves around so the flat panel might be optimal at one point in the day, but will certainly be sub-optimal at other times. This isn't a clear cut argument at all.

Not all of us could spend our technologically-driven retirement writing like Shakespeare, painting like Monet and exploring like Richard Branson, but our average quality of life has a very long way to go.<p>There's some residual puritanical disgust at the idea of living mostly without work, but it's clearly going to become technologically possible in some number of years. This post-scarcity world is when we're going to really be able to shine as a species, even if our society will be radically restructured in the process.

2906741,comment,2902329,2905474,5,0,colanderman,,,"I'll do my best to sum up what I do. I've never put this in words before.<p>My modus operandi involves building a mental model of what the student knows, doesn't know, and how they think about the problem in question. Usually I do this through targeted questioning, and watching faces for signs of confusion in a group session. e.g. let's say we're working on Newtonian physics. I might take a model car with occupants, roll it along a table, and ask what happens when the car hits something. From this I can judge whether the students understand momentum.<p>If their mental model is wrong, next you have to break it down. How to do this varies based on how committed they are to their model -- if you challenge their views in too dramatic a manner you can lose their trust and frustrate future lessons. For students whom are less committed to their incorrect model, it suffices to demonstrate a counterexample. Those who are more commited can require several weeks to shake their beliefs.<p>Actually teaching involves three parts: definitions, questioning, and experience. Definitions are KEY. You can build an entire lesson around a solid definition. For example: ""speed is how far something travels every second"" (or ""in a certain amount of time"" for the ones able to handle abstraction). Keep definitions few and far betweens and simple. Refer back to them often.<p>Next follow up with questioning: how can we measure speed? do we know how to measure the things in the definition? if something moved ten meters in five seconds, how many meters did it move every second? This has been covered elsewhere in depth. Don't overdo it though, some kids hate questioning. Just tell them facts.<p>Oh, be consistent. Use vocabulary consistently, don't throw around new terms, stick to one system of units, etc. Minimize distraction and confusion.<p>Experience is key to solidifying rules deduced from questioning. Roll that cart down the hill. Practice those factoring problems. Not everyone needs experience but most do. Experience can help break down incorrect mental models. As with definitions, minimize distraction. Experience one thing at a time until it is understood.<p>Finally, don't be afraid to go off on tangents. If a kid expresses interest in something, that means they will be focused and eager to learn it. You can teach almost anything to a student who wants to learn it. Motivation is everything.<p>I hope this helps. It's early in the morning and I'm writing this on my Kindle so it's probably rambly and missing things. I'll try to remedy that throughout the day.",1313851524

How is it that people don't at least wonder why cars, manufacturing robots, computers etc. etc, haven't lead to mass systemic unemployment, but future technologies will?<p>The reason technology doesn't create systemic unemployment is that people don't just shrivel up and die when they lose their job. If someone is replaced with a piece of software they don't just say ""oh well, I'm just gonna sit here and starve."" They either find a job in a sector that requires minimal training, or they re-train.

</code></pre>
We want to do a quick check.  We can do that by doing all the sums modulo 9.  A neat trick is that a number mod 9 is unchanged by adding up the digits (and equating 0 with 9).<p>Therefore 12 (mod 9) is also equal to (1+2) (mod 9) and 1+2 is simply3.  You can check, 12 mod 9 really is three.<p>Likewise 13 (mod 9) is (1+3) (mod 9) which is 4.  And when you divide 13 by 9 you do indeed get a remainder of 4.<p>You should also check this with bigger numbers.  What's 34857345 (mod 9) ??  Add up the digits. lather, rinse, repeat, see what you get.  Then compute 34857345 % 9.<p>Back to the sum.  12 * 13 (mod 9) reduces to (3 * 4) (mod 9) which is 12 (mod 9) which is (1+2) which is 3.<p>That's the LHS.  What about the RHS?<p>156 (mod 9) is 1+5+6 (mod 9) which is 12 (mod 9) which is 3, the same as the LHS.  So this passes our ""Modulo 9"" test.<p>This is like a parity check, but more powerful.<p>Just wish the website said it better.",1313849923

With the obvious caveat that many games, indeed, have names that don't relate directly to their content, many of the most successful ones do. Angry Birds, Halo, Super Mario Bros, World of Warcraft, etc.<p>2) The term ""thick lips"", while not directly insulting anyone, still has many negative connotations in the US of referring to folks of African descent. A similar scenario might be present if you made a game about collecting firewood and called it ""Fags"".<p>3) Your game might just be boring. (Please don't take this the wrong way as I haven't played your game)",1313848872

G+ isn't some right that Google is required to make available for everyone.<p>Google's handling of this is a bit ham-fisted to be sure, but equally irksome is the vitriolic entitlement mentality that a lot (not all) are bringing to the discussion.",1313848838
2906647,comment,2905686,2906412,2,0,pyre,,,"Point #3 is not entirely true. The article seemed to imply that the law was all about advocating for the child, instead of pandering to a disagreement between the biological parents at the (possible) expense of the child.<p>This implies that I may not even need to have sex to be forced into child support payments. For example, what if someone sneaks into my bedroom at night (or maybe we're sharing a hotel room while travelling) and is able to make off with some semen while I sleep? By the legal argument that we must advocate for the child, I would be forced into child support. Sure, I could attempt to seek some sort of relief from the mother for what she did, but that would be completely separate from whether or not I am legally obligated to pay child support for the next 18 years.<p>Maybe all men should be forced to wear locks on their genitalia lest some crazy woman somewhere decide that they want to force the man to create a child?",1313848826
2906646,comment,2905686,2906490,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> I'm wondering if you're just trolling - ""studied a lot of history"" and then saying ""exceedingly good relations with China"" combined with ""japan remilitarises"". I don't think you've read enough history there...<p>I tried writing up all the credentials I have that make me have a clear understanding here, but I don't know how to do it without looking snarky. But anyways, today I'm in Beijing, yesterday I was in Hong Kong, last week I was in Japan, and tomorrow I'm getting my hair cut with the nephew of one of the top CPC officials who is my friend and occasionally someone I do business with. And yeah, I read a lot of history.<p>So anyways. I think you might be uninformed about modern Japanese/Chinese relations.<p>For instance, there's only four countries that get visa free entry into the PRC without any public business.<p>Guess who is on the list?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China#Eligible_nationalities_for_visa-free_entry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_the_People%27s_R...</a><p>Huh. Interesting point? Don't the Chinese hate the Japanese?<p>Answer: nope! The leadership doesn't, anyways. The common people do, it's a common enemy for them, just like illegal immigration from Mexico is a common enemy for much of the American Midwest. But the leadership of China are extremely practical, intelligent, and unsentimental people. If a good relationship with Japan is good for China, they'll do it. If Japan makes friendly overtures simultaneously with re-arming and stays on good terms with the USA, yes that's all very possible.<p>As for the rest of your comment, man you've seriously got to check your own claims more. For instance -<p>> Far from renouncing war, the US both pursues and idolises it.<p>Okay. So, you'd expect a greater number of people among the upper class to be joining the military, a greater number of representatives to be coming from former soldiers, and more presidents to be former servicemen too?<p>Right? You'd expect those numbers to be increasing if American militarism is increasing? Are they increasing? No...? Is there a <i>hole in your theory</i>...? Hmm...",1313848801

10602630,comment,10597896,10600042,0,0,jganetsk,,,"We hear you.<p>Let me see if I&#x27;m understanding the criticism: when creating a consumer, the sync point of a new consumer really should start from the very beginning of the topic, at a predictable explicit start point, rather than at the current end of the topic. This makes a lot of sense, and yes, there is a disconnect between the models. We think the capabilities you are talking about are great and those use cases are important. All I can say is keep your eyes open.<p>We went with defaults from Google&#x27;s internal use of Pub/Sub, which is older than the public release of Kinesis and Kafka. Internal use involves an approach where topics and consumers are very long-lived. Topics are high throughput, in terms of bytes published per unit time. Retaining all messages and starting consumers from the very beginning wasn&#x27;t a sensible default; our focus was more centered on making sure that, once topics and consumers were set up, consumers could keep up over time.<p>One example use case to help illustrate this thinking is doing real-time sentiment analysis on tweets: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3mfuc-syTI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3mfuc-syTI</a><p>In the work described by that video, they were essentially publishing tweets in real time into a Cloud Pub/Sub topic, thus making an &quot;all tweets on Twitter in realtime&quot; topic. This is a great example of a topic where producers and consumers are completely decoupled from each other. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make sense to retain all tweets forever by default (although there certainly are use cases for that). There are plenty of use cases where a consumer might want to say &quot;ok, please start retaining all tweets made from here on out&quot; rather than starting from a specific tweet.",1448042071

This pertains mainly to optimizing engineering models, which tend to be continuous or mixed integer.  GAs are just OK at combinatorial optimization (although GP is pretty nifty, from what I hear about it).<p>* Steady-state: pioneered to the best of my knowledge by Deb&#x27;s epsilon-MOEA, steady-state algorithms use function evaluations as soon as they are received, rather than waiting for a whole generation to complete. [1]<p>* Multi-objective: Pareto ranking as dominance relation lets us have multiple objectives [2].  This is good because it gives us a whole bunch of solutions at once and lets us decide which one we want, instead of tweaking objectives and constraints to get an idea of the tradeoffs involved.<p>* Epsilon resolution: comes from an idea by Laumanns et al. [3].  We can have more objectives if we don&#x27;t care about differences below a certain threshold.  Otherwise the Pareto front explodes in size.<p>* Restarting: Proposed by Coello-Coello [4] and demonstrated by his micro-GA, restarting helps you get out of local optima.<p>* Better search operators: Binary crossover doesn&#x27;t work so well, especially for real-valued decision variables.  It took some fancy theoretical footwork involving schema theory and domino convergence to support it.  There were a lot of new search operators proposed in the late &#x27;90s, the best of which seem to be simulated binary crossover (SBX), and polynomial mutation (PM).  [5]<p>* Alternatively, the Differential Evolution search operator [6] works really well too.<p>* Better selection operator: tournament selection beats the pants off of the alternatives [7].<p>Resources:<p>* Dave Hadka&#x27;s MOEAFramework [8], which includes open-source multi-objective evolutionary algorithm implementations.<p>* Dave Hadka&#x27;s dissertation [9], which describes a (regrettably patented) MOEA that&#x27;s kind of a greatest-hits of good MOEA ideas.<p>* Deb&#x27;s website [10], which includes questionably-licensed algorithm implementations, as well as a number of technical reports.<p>Links.

10602318,comment,10601265,10601265,0,0,etangent,,,"IMO, there exist good arguments against surveillance. But why are supposedly rational geeks so irrationally prone to putting forward very bad arguments against it? See almost every reply in this thread to prove my point, but I will list a few:<p>1) If one took basic statistics, one would deem the proposition that &quot;X is useless because [a target of X] has just slipped through&quot; as outrageously wrong and a prime example of both selection bias and reliance on anecdotal evidence, yet somehow in the context of surveillance, this argument is taken at face value. You see otherwise smart people posting and retweeting this argument as if they thought it a valid one.<p>2) In almost any other context, a rational thing to do is to evaluate both sides and, if one seems beneficial but dangerous, propose laws to regulate it (aka: don&#x27;t use surveillance for blackmailing political candidates since it contradicts democratic principles). Yet in the context of surveillance, a geek will talk in completely black-and-white terms, and not even consider proposing laws to regulate its impact. For an extended example, a common argument against surveillance is that places the entity wielding it &quot;outside of law&quot;. Yet democracies have developed well-established methods for dealing with entities in power that try to place themselves outside of law. That is the reason why we have a president with a fixed term rather than a king, for example.<p>3) If surveillance can be used for blackmailing, then obviously it has to work quite well in the first place (be comprehensive, with ability to target specific individuals). Yet the same geek who argues that surveillance is dangerous because it can be used for blackmailing will also try argue, often in the same paragraph, that surveillance doesn&#x27;t work, is not effective, or is very easily circumventable. To any impartial outside observer, the argument that &quot;X is not effective! But X is dangerous because it is effective!&quot; would seem like a contradiction, no?<p>4) Then there is the tired/insensitive argument that &quot;more people die from furniture than from terrorism&quot;. First, this is probably only true in the West, and not in places like Nigeria or MENA (this is a good chart <a href=""http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2015/11/blogs/graphic-detail/20151121_woc539.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecac...</a>). Second, almost all animals (and yes, humans are primates/animals) pay a lot more attention to predators and to acts of violence between each other than to random accidents, and there is an evolutionary reason for that (which specifically is left as an exercise to the reader). I would also argue that, since this behavior is so incredibly prevalent among animals of all kinds, it&#x27;s almost definitely not an example of a &quot;maladaptive&quot; cognitive bias. Finally, <i>even if it were</i> maladaptive, one can&#x27;t just simply discount it (an entire country experiencing a fascist freakout against a minority group is not a good thing IMO, whether a result of a cognitive bias or not).<p>5) For almost every other technology, geeks will argue (often obnoxiously/pedantically) that it can be both good and bad, depending on how it is wielded (see nuclear power). But surveillance is also a technology, yet you almost never see a geek saying &quot;surveillance can be either good or bad&quot; -- no, to a geek, surveillance is bad, period. It&#x27;s like surveillance is this <i>one thing</i> that technology-loving geeks can feel justified to act luddite about.<p>Why is that?",1448039454

The general consensus is that the current lows is actually due to over supply by the shipping giants like maersk.<p>More reading:<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/ec...</a><p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/02/05/why-you-shouldnt-worry-about-the-baltic-dry-index-hitting-a-29-year-low/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/02/05/why-you-s...</a>",1448039155

Therefore, bitcoin does not need to increase in value for it to be successful, and in the long term the price is irrelevant. Bitcoin can be used as a medium of exchange without regard to the price, and many people at Coinbase believe in this future (rather than bitcoin becoming a widely used currency held directly by end users, at least in the near future).<p>Secondly, many people at Coinbase believe deeply in the decentralized (and potentially anonymous/privacy-focused) aspects of using bitcoin as a currency (myself included). However, bitcoin cannot be successful as a currency unless it is easy to exchange between bitcoin and your local currency, and bitcoin won&#x27;t gain worldwide acceptance until it is easy to (a) exchange bitcoin and (b) spend bitcoin. Therefore, Coinbase&#x27;s primary goal is to make buying and selling bitcoin as easy as possible, so that we can enable a future where financial privacy is optional (versus today, where it is basically inescapable).",1448039005

Floating point on the PS2 is slightly different from ieee754 (no infinite, different rounding), and emulating it using a standard Intel/AMD cpu is extremely slow. (I have an idea to speed it up using doubles, and I&#x27;m curious how Sony has solved this). The SPU&#x27;s on the PS3 have the same weird floating point, so this made emulation easier.<p>One other problem is the slightly unique gpu in the PS2, called the Graphic Synthesizer (GS). The gpu in the PS3 was not able to emulate it, just because it is so different. (More specifically, the GS has 32 bit z index, and scissoring is different.) Sony had to include an actual GS in the PS3 for PS2 emulation. They took this out to make it cheaper, and this is when they lost PS2 emulation. I believe modern GPU&#x27;s are flexible enough to emulate the GS, especially since Sony has access to the complete GPU.",1448038986

But the two seem similar in that they empower the children to choose their own activities.<p>Rather than dictating specific activities following a schedule, Montessori structures learning by providing a large variety of &quot;materials&quot; (basically mini-puzzles that challenge a specific sensorial/motor skill with increasing levels of difficulty), and letting children choose their own activities. The teacher takes a passive observer role, merely demonstrating how activities are done (e.g. sorting sticks in order of length)<p>The rationale is that children are naturally curious and can frequently get into the &quot;flow&quot; with a puzzle.<p>Wikipedia has this to say about studies:<p>&quot;A 2005 study and associated review concluded that Montessori education results in comparable (but not higher) academic achievement to traditional approaches. The review also concluded that studies have found no detectable differences in personality as a result of attending Montessori schools.[25] The study of the public high school in the Milwaukee Public Schools found that Montessori students, aged 3–11, outperformed control groups on maths and science,[26] and that Montessori had some of the largest positive effects on achievement of all programs evaluated.[27] Another study that compared the academic achievement of 543 urban 4th- (n=291) and 8th- (n=252) grade students who attended Montessori or traditional education programs failed to support the hypothesis that enrollment in a Montessori school was associated with higher academic achievement.[28]&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education#Studies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education#Studies</a><p>I&#x27;d be curious to see more studies w/ montessori+sudbury education compared to traditional (especially considering many &quot;montessori&quot; schools nowadays have mixed methodologies that differ from the original methodology developed by Maria Montessori)",1448038919

It&#x27;s not just LLs who have an incentive to keep supply down; it&#x27;s homeowners too. And banks, and estate agents (realtors), and builders, and media that relies on property advertising, and policians wanting votes and/or donations from any of the above. Anyone with a vested interest in higher prices has an incentive to constrain supply.<p>2. I don&#x27;t think reduced buying decreases new build directly; a lot (most) of new-build here in London is being bought to rent (or even bought to leave empty while waiting for capital gains). Supply constraints are coming from all the people in point 1.<p>3. Various countries have failed in various specifics, but I think the overall driver for this worldwide is pretty clear: the Great Recession and resulting drive to &quot;zero interest rates forever&quot;. The ultimate encouragement to take on ballooning mortgage debt, sending prices into the stratosphere and drawing in speculators, while at the same time punishing most non-parasitic forms of saving via financial repression.",1448038870

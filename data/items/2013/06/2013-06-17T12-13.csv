5892859,comment,5892754,5892754,2,0,gexla,,,"Elance and Odesk can actually pay pretty well. I regularly find jobs which I know exactly what&#x27;s required but are quoted really high by people who don&#x27;t really know what they are bidding on. I think what happens is that one bidder comes up with a number pulled out of thin air and then the rest of the bidders use that as a starting point and just bid a little lower. In this case I just bid the average of the top bids and then I&#x27;m usually able to get the job because I know the problem so well. A job under $500 is still a good one if you are able to knock it out quick and hit $100 / hour. The problem with this is that it takes more time to find the diamonds in the rough.",1371473960

Senator Feingold, who has repeatedly raised concerns about the implementation of the PAA and its successor, the FISA Amendments Act (FAA), in classified communications with the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General, has stated that the courts analysis would have been fundamentally altered had the company had access to this information and been able to bring it before the court.</i><p><i>In the absence of specific complaints from the company, the court relied on the good faith of the government. As the court concluded, [w]ithout something more than a purely speculative set of imaginings, we cannot infer that the purpose of the directives (and, thus, of the surveillance) is other than their stated purpose.... One example of the courts deference to the government concerns minimization procedures, which require the government to limit the dissemination of information about Americans that it collects in the course of its surveillance. Because the company did not raise concerns about minimization, the court s[aw] no reason to question the adequacy of the minimization protocol. And yet, the existence of adequate minimization procedures, as applied in this case, was central to the courts constitutional analysis.</i><p>More at

5892798,comment,5892625,5892625,1,0,gexla,,,"> but nothing matches the joy of working for yourself at your own pace.<p>That&#x27;s the opposite of how I would describe freelancing. You aren&#x27;t working for yourself at your own pace, you are working for your clients at their pace. Rather than having one boss, you have multiple bosses. Sure, you can pick your projects and have the client agree on a timeline you set, but I assume you can do that on the job as well.<p>That work doesn&#x27;t include the time you need to spend on marketing, branding, creating proposals for jobs you get passed over on and a long list of other things which you don&#x27;t have to do when working a typical job.<p>You might think you would have more freedom as a freelancer, but that&#x27;s often not the case. If you could charge high rates and live super cheap, then this would largely be true. But living super cheap often means that you are living in an area which makes charging high rates relatively difficult (you can&#x27;t get that &quot;face time&quot; which certain clients require, which means you have no leg up on your competition which might be charging less.) This is where your marketing really helps.<p>As a freelancer you will likely find that you are working more hours than you were at your job. Every hour working is really working. I can only put in about six hours of coding per day because I&#x27;m at such a high level of focus. At your job, you may be there eight hours, but how much of that time is spent truly working? Again, on top of that time spent on client work, you have other non billable tasks you have to do for your business. And since you are still trading dollars for hours, you still have that ceiling of 24 hours per day.<p>Another point that I believe is critical to consider is that there is a lot of gray area between freelancing and working a regular job. For some people, the only difference is in the forms they are having to fill out for taxes. I have had long term freelance gigs which were basically jobs. And people who have jobs should probably be marketing themselves just as a freelancer would. If you find this describes you in your freelancing, then you should probably just stick with a regular job.<p>Instead of freelancing, you would be better off removing that word from your vocabulary. Instead, shoot for running a sustainable business which doesn&#x27;t live and die by your hourly work. Do some Googling to find case studies of people like you who have been able to move on to different business models, or at least supplement their hourly work with other forms of income. You aren&#x27;t truly your own boss until you are able to earn money while on vacation or sleeping.<p>To answer your questions:<p>When to make the leap?<p>As the other comment mentioned. You need to have at least 3 months living expenses, but once you dip below that, you are approaching critical levels. You should have at least 6 months, but the more the merrier. This is so important as the lower you get, the more desperate your cash flow situation becomes. The best case scenario is that you can plan out months, maybe even years rather than having to worry about what you are going to eat tomorrow.<p>You should have a decent amount of experience built up, but a lot of people make the leap without this. I think there is a market for all levels of experience. A lot of freelancers go that route simply because that&#x27;s the only way for them to get work as a developer. You do what you have to (and this applies to the financial part also.)<p>How do you manage your time and what to do when you don&#x27;t have work?<p>There is a ton of work out there. I rarely if ever hit a point where I have nothing on my plate. If I do, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m between projects and in this case I can still take on small stuff.<p>Time management is something that is different for everyone.

[8]<p>edit: that&#x27;s 97 billion <i>computer records</i>. Metadata for 124 billion phone calls was also recorded over those 30 days.<p>The NSA does not define &quot;collection&quot; as actually obtaining the data or metadata, it is defined as a human analyst viewing the data.[2]<p>11 FISA court warrant requests have been rejected over it&#x27;s existence, out of over 33,000 total. The last one rejected was in 2009.[3] Warrants are also only needed retroactively (within a 7 day period), there is no need to obtain one before accessing data.[4] According to the New York Times, &quot;FISA orders can range from inquiries about specific people to a broad sweep for intelligence, like logs of certain search terms, lawyers who work with the orders said.&quot; [5]<p>The Fisa Amendment Act section 702 bars the NSA from collecting data on people &quot;reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.&quot;[4] Additionally, data can be <i>intentionally</i> collected on any communication that has at least one foreign recipient or sender.[6] Note also that these warrants specifically contradict the fourth amendment, but as long as the target is &quot;reasonably believed&quot; to be a foreigner, it doesn&#x27;t matter to the NSA.<p>The test of whether someone is located outside the US has been interpreted as a keyword-based system indicating that it is at least 51% likely. And if they aren&#x27;t actually foreigners? It&#x27;s nothing to worry about, just include it on a quarterly report.[7] It&#x27;s also possible that a warrant for a foreigner would permit access to data on US citizens up to 2 social &quot;hops&quot; away, but [citation needed].<p>Additional reading: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/foreign-surveillance-history-privacy-erosions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/foreign-surveillance-h...</a><p>Written primarily for my own benefit, posted in the hope that someone else finds it informative.<p>p.s.

While going off on your own can be highly rewarding, it is not without stress and requires high degrees of focus and hard work.<p>With that said, if you are single I would have at minimum 3 months of living expenses saved up before I even thought of quitting my full-time, secure paycheck job. Preferably you would have 6 months to a year worth of savings just in case. If you are married and have a family, I would at least say 1 year worth of savings before I quit.<p>Prior to quitting though, I would get my feet wet by finding small jobs on the side and slowly building up clients. This is good not only from the experience prospective, but provides you with contacts and portfolio material.<p>Managing your time can be tricky and everyone has their own methods for doing it. Personally, I use several lists to keep track of on-going tasks and use software like Basecamp to manage projects. My lists that I keep are for daily, weekly, and overall project tasks. Each day I try to complete at least the daily list and build the next days list from the weekly and project lists.<p>Working for yourself it is inevitable that there will be slow months or months where you do not get any new clients. This can be depressing and add stress. The key here is to not let it get you down, know that everyone experiences bad months and just keep moving forward with current projects. For slower months I always reach out to past clients to touch base, feel them out for additional work, and depending on the relationship I have built with them, see if they know anyone looking for my services. Referrals are your best friend.<p>I am not going to try and make it sound glamorous, freelancing is not, but on the flip side it can be very rewarding and provide you with excellent learning opportunities and growth. Just understand that there are a lot of things that going on long with it. You are now responsible for all your own taxes, insurance, and the &quot;business&quot; side of the house.<p>Based on your job title, it sounds like you are young and just getting started. I don&#x27;t know your experience level or education, but I would say solely based on your title, to continue working for a few more years at least. If freelancing is something that interests you, start small and part time finding and taking on small jobs here and there if you can. This will give you experience managing your time, working on projects independently, and a little extra income, all while you still collect a steady (and guaranteed hopefully) paycheck from your employer.<p>Good luck!",1371470980

Try  asking constructive questions that will either lead you to realize that it doesnt suck and that the 5 minutes of thought you put into it is orders of magnitude less than the time and effort she/he put into it. Or you will get them to stumble upon a perspective they havent yet considered and maybe find a solution to it - or if it truly does suck - realize the same and spend time figuring out what to do.

There have been articles about how the City of London has neighborhoods of empty luxury apartment developments owned by various sheikhs and russian/central asian commodities oligarchs.<p>In SF when you buy a house you are also competing with dozens of investors from overseas paying cash who don&#x27;t have any intention of ever living there. I believe that the Vancouver real estate market was also affected by overseas investors in a similar way, making it the least affordable housing market in North America.<p>Multiply this speculative real estate investment by 1% of 7 billion and it could very well be a major factor in pushing up rents, especially in certain super desirable cities like Paris. There&#x27;s about 1.7 million residences there. Even if only 1% of the 1% want a pied a terre there, the rest of the people trying to live there would feel the squeeze.<p>I have personally seen the effects of this. When I lived in on South 4th street in Williamsburg Brooklyn in 1998, my floor through apartment was $700/m. Now the same apartment is renting for $3700 a month.

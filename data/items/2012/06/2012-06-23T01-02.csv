Frequently, however, the TOS are ambiguous and are interpreted inconsistently.  They can also be changed at will.<p>Sure, you're right that developers should try to give as much benefit back to their platform provider as they derive from the platform.  But the fact is that different companies perceive benefit in different ways with reasoning that is opaque.  Often a decision can depend on a strategic direction for the firm that you are not privy to.<p>All this is why the reputation of the company matters so much.  From reading the article, it looks like LinkedIn not only acted in a very inconsistent manner--giving praise before shutting them down--but they even began reverse-engineering the application.  That's not the kind of behavior that breeds a healthy ecosystem regardless of whether they have all the right to act that way, and regardless of whether Pealk was careless in relying so heavily on LinkedIn.<p>If everyone were to take a cautious approach to the APIs and platforms that big companies offer, as has been suggested in this thread, then the tech sector would be a much less interesting place.

Consider the following:<p>- You have a team that has been working incredibly hard pursuing a dream: that they can build a product, from scratch, that is truly useful to millions and millions of people. This is not an EA requiring engineers to pull insane hours -- this is a labor of love and everyone has considerable equity.<p>- It's a small team and that means each person has a lot of responsibility. Don't like ever having to pull an all-nighter? Never want to work a minute past 5? That's OK, but it means you have no real responsibility, and you will be compensated accordingly. Others choose more responsibility, and they man up when the shit occasionally hits the fan.<p>- Have you ever coordinated a massive press push with the top print publications? Then you have no business telling them how it should be done. It's extremely difficult, it requires dates locked down months ahead of time, and with that kind of advanced commitment, planning 100% accurately is beyond difficult.<p>- After this ordeal, the team posts an honest story from the trenches. Go to any successful startup and you will hear many war stories like this. Nothing is ever perfectly planned, unexpected shit happens. It's frankly awesome that they shared it and gave some insight into what goes on behind the scenes that you don't normally hear about.<p>- What is your reaction? You shit all over them.

4149769,comment,4146912,4146912,1,0,domador,,,"The analogy drawn between evolution and artificial intelligence is interesting, yet ultimately deficient in at least one key aspect.  Yes, the steps performed by a computer are unintelligent, just like mutation and natural selection within evolution.  However, unlike the process of life according to evolution, computers are not purposeless or directionless.  Computers were designed and imbued with a purpose (computation) by intelligent beings, in contrast to evolutions blind watchmaker.  Yes, unintelligent computers can perform intelligent processes (for a particular definition of intelligence).  Yet it remains up to intelligent beings to judge the final output produced by computers: whether such output makes sense, is useful, or is true.  Even if eventually a computer designed by another computer (or a lineage of computers) manages to pass the most brutal of Turing tests, you cant get away from the fact that such a computer ultimately owes its direction, purpose, and intelligence to the intelligent beings who put together its oldest ancestor.<p>For an apt analogy between AI and evolution, a computer would need to exist and compute without any involvement from intelligent beings at any point in its existence.  That computer would need to develop its direction and processes in absolute, unintelligent independence.  We couldnt develop such a computer ourselves; wed need to discover it somewhere in the natural world (perhaps lying within a mineral deposit).  However, at this point wed be drawing an analogy between evolution and another form of itself.  Circular analogies arent very useful.<p>The author writes, in order to be a perfect and beautiful computing machine, it is not requisite to know what arithmetic is.  This is true, but knowledge of arithmetic (or a higher form of reasoning) is required in order to produce such a machine in the first place.  At least thats what we can tell based on the only computers available to us (all of which owe their existence to knowledgeable beings).",1340415578

And that's what the public sees.  Class actions are supposed to be about jusdicial efficiency.  If enough plaintiffs all file suits with the same claims in the same court against BigCorp, the court is going likely to refuse to hear each one individually.  Too much work.  Courts are staffed by people who are lazy just like you and me.  In nerd speak, developers do not keep answering the same questions again and again.  They create FAQ's.  The court will be more receptive to all these repetitive suits against BigCorp if the suits are filed as one: a class action.  The court hears one case, and reduces its workload.<p>Given that we now have the means to easily coordinate group action via internet, e.g. group buying, crowd sourcing, etc., what's to stop people from coordinating group litigation.  If enough people invidually file suits against Facebook with the same court, it leaves that court little choice but to encourage a class action.  Companies like Microsoft can make you agree not to join a class action, but they can't stop you from filing a suit on your own for any and every claim.  And if enough customers file the same suit in the same court, a class action may well be the result, even though the customers never sought to join one.  And that's because class actions are not about shaking down BigCorp by rounding up plaintiffs.  They are about reducing the workload of the court and the expense of hearing numerous suits all with the same claims and facts.<p>If a large contigent of Facebook users all resolved to sue Facebook at the same time in the same jurisdiction, _individually_, the results could be very interesting.",1340413973

You should let your data be completely open. Let people do whatever they want with it. CL is an institution. You are a backbone of the internet.

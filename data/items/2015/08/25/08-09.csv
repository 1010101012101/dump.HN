Once you have to call an external function, you lose all compiler optimizations that might take place. If you write low level &quot;primitive&quot; operations (e.g. matrix multiply and inverse), you will get worse performance by doing external function calls rather than having your code made visible to the compiler so that it can be inlined and optimized.<p>Additionally, you can&#x27;t write assembler SIMD code that is portable from architecture to architecture. This can be done in C using extensions but not if you stick to the standard (and support MSVC). Quite a lot of SIMD code can be written portably without having to use architecture specific instructions.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a good thing that languages like Rust have native SIMD.",1440492752

I guess my question is - do you use &#x27;averaging&#x27; of word vectors or the Chinese Restaurant process - to get to sub reddit vectors.

Averaging has this awful &#x27;revert to mean&#x27; thing that turns all the paragraph vectors into a sort of bland gray goo where they are all the same.<p>If you did use Chinese Restaurant process (I love that phrase - brings back memories of an occasion at a Dim Sum restaurant where this almost literally happened) it&#x27;d be great to see any source code you may feel like releasing ;_) ... well, it can&#x27;t hurt to ask..",1440492732

It means your emotions are way too much present: the fact that something is terribly relevant to you doesn&#x27;t imply that you&#x27;re an &quot;expert&quot; in it.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t discount emotions as being irrelevant for health. Patient involvement is very important in the empowerment process, and the patient is the expert in the ways that physician can never be: [s]he, not the physician, knows that drug A causes his/her skin itch; he, not the physician, cares for the quality of life, etc. And, sadly, you miss the point completely: experts have broad knowledge of the situation, while the &quot;expert&quot; patient knows (with the help of experts, of course, of course, of course) his exact case. And the &quot;thinking&quot; part is not done by physician all the time. Empowered patient does the majority of &quot;thinking&quot;, the physician is there for support and information. Physician is the expert systems&#x27; knowledge base, while the empowered patient is the expert system doing the &quot;thinking&quot; and making informed/educated decisions.<p>Edit: e.g. <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399109003279"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399109...</a>\n(emphasis mine)<p>>Conclusion<p>>Unlike the traditional approach, empowerment is not something one does to patients. Rather, empowerment begins when HCPs acknowledge that patient are in control of their daily diabetes care.<p>>Empowerment occurs when the HCPs goal is to increase the capacity of patients <i>to think critically and make autonomous, informed decisions</i>. Empowerment also occurs when patients are actually making autonomous, informed decisions about their diabetes self-management.<p>And this is not a new thing in heathcare either, there is a plethora of articles saying the same since 1994.",1440492148

Contemptible and gross adulterations of all\n    conceivable kinds were everywhere the rule. The dough of \n    bread was mingled with alum, carbonate of lime, bone ash, \n    potatoes, and beans.

Canistered fish were tinted red by\n    ferruginous earths.\n</code></pre>\nNow, some of these are still in use; gypsum &quot;chalk&quot; is harmless and an essential ingredient in many foods; alum is safe up to a certain level, and is an important ingredient in some kinds of pickling; sulfuric acid is perfectly harmless in sufficiently small quantities (it&#x27;s GRAS, but I think still illegal in vinegar, and dangerously prone to pick up heavy metals); and as far as I know you can still tint your canned fish red with ochre, which is GRAS too.

It tried to recover with OS/2. It was a pretty good platform but they couldn&#x27;t get the details right. This was was fizzing as well.<p>Around 1996 they made a pivot. They invested heavily to recreate themselves as a company who sold services based on Windows NT.

One of the stories of the late 90s was the way that IBM had reinvented themselves.<p>Then, shrewdly, they invested heavily in Linux. At a time, FreeBSD was still a much better platform. But Linux had the GPL behind it. The GPL forces people to release changes. This sabotaged the commercial software market, which IBM had already lost.

Generally you can&#x27;t just go to Farnell and get things next-day, if they&#x27;re not in stock, 13 week lead times are not uncommon - and a company can have 4000 items in stock one day, and they&#x27;ll be gone the next (so checking stock levels is not enough!).<p>3. Features - definitely be sensible. Listen to your backers but be very careful about adding their suggestions.

Adding features in software after the ship date is easy and people like it, but delaying the ship date for features would rarely be appreciated.<p>4. Margins.

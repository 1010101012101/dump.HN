Most people in high end math contests are just smart and do no preparation.  They just accidentally scored high on the AMC. A lot do some practice for fun, because the contests are fun.  Possible exceptions are a handful of people at Philips Exeter++ and maybe Thomas Jefferson High School, I&#x27;m not familiar with that dynamic. Contests like the ARML are oriented around making local friends more than anything.  At the most local levels it&#x27;s like, some high school teachers will corral their students into doing a contest at the nearby college one afternoon.<p>For example some friends of mine in the Philadelphia area thought it would be neat to enter the Harvard/MIT math contest (which is way more fun and difficult than the Temple School of Actuarial Sciences contest or Drexel&#x27;s).  It was the kids telling their parents they were doing this, and deciding to practice for it.  I think the same happened with a group of students in Albany.<p>++and they were recruited after performing well on middle and elementary school math contests that parents are completely unaware of.",1426722957

There are also disadvantages, but I don&#x27;t think too many parentheses is the main problem, at least not for me. The simple syntax means there are fewer visual cues for language elements, and I think this reduces readability. Clojure is a move in the right direction because it makes more use of punctuation.<p>Edit: I forgot to add that whatever the disadvantages of Lisp-style syntax, saying it has to die is ridiculous.

Since the entire ROM could be disassembled, developers started exploiting un-documented features, for instance by manipulating RAM locations and branching into the middle of routines. A book, <i>What&#x27;s Where in the Apple II</i> contained hundreds of useful addresses and entry points. As a result, Apple lost control of their API, and could not upgrade the system without breaking popular software titles.<p>The Apple //e was a heroic effort to preserve software compatibility, but included a bare minimum of new features. I suspect this may have been a factor towards Apple developing their next big thing -- the Mac -- as a closed system.<p>A similar thing happened to the IBM PC, because developers started hard-coding the known address space of the display RAM, rather than going through system calls, resulting in the famous 640k barrier.",1426721131

9229245,comment,9226456,9229111,0,0,mikeash,,,"I&#x27;m totally behind the JPEG artifact theory and am definitely not making that point just so I can ask for unobtainable evidence. It is, in my opinion, blindingly obvious upon zooming in on the original JPEG.<p>For anyone not versed in this stuff, JPEG works by breaking the image up into 8x8 squares (possibly 16x16, or 8x16, or 16x8, but 8x8 is standard). For each square, the encoder then transforms the pixel data into the frequency domain using the discrete cosine transform. The frequency data is then what is ultimately losslessly compressed and encoded in the actual JPEG data.<p>Now, here&#x27;s a zoomed-in screenshot of the rock in question, taken from the original JPEG with no alterations whatsoever:<p><a href=""http://mikeash.com/tmp/screenshot_F574A0FB-5919-4E2C-AEA3-C3B08741204B.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mikeash.com/tmp/screenshot_F574A0FB-5919-4E2C-AEA3-C3...</a><p>The 8x8 grid stands out like a sore thumb at this zoom level. You can clearly see that the vertical separation of the &quot;teeth&quot; are just macroblock boundaries. There is clearly an actual horizontal dark streak in there, but the division of the areas above and below into separate vertical &quot;teeth&quot; is, to me, blindingly obviously a JPEG encoding artifact and nothing more.<p>Would I be convinced if the raw images showed these features as well? Probably not. But that doesn&#x27;t invalidate my point. If somebody showed a picture of Bigfoot, and I noticed that their supposed Bigfoot is wearing a digital watch, it would be perfectly reasonable to point that out. Explaining away the watch would not silence my doubts, but it&#x27;s still a completely reasonable thing to point out when someone shows a picture of Bigfoot and he&#x27;s wearing a digital watch.<p>Do I know how to obtain a raw image? Nope. I wish I did. I briefly searched around for one, but with no success. My point is simply that JPEG images cannot be relied upon for fine detail, and if one is going to make claims about Mars rovers finding alien statues, the evidence needs to be clearly <i>not</i> due to JPEG artifacts, preferably by finding the original, uncompressed data. Scientists don&#x27;t use JPEG-compressed photos for analysis, and this is why. The fact that a raw image is difficult to obtain is unfortunate, but completely not my fault, and doesn&#x27;t alter the facts that 1) you really need a raw image to say anything about this photo and 2) the &quot;teeth&quot; in this photo are really, really, really clearly JPEG macroblocks.",1426720186

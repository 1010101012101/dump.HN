2774563,comment,2773180,2773180,1,0,ForrestN,,,"I'm agnostic about the longterm prospects for Quora, but this article is not compelling at all.<p>""It's not the next big thing anymore"" is silly and could be applied to anything other than Google+ (according to this analyst). Web startups aren't zero-sum and there's no evidence provided that Google+ has harmed Quora's momentum. They aren't even direct competitors.<p>""It doesn't solve a problem"" is a strange objection. Quora attempts to solve a few problems, perhaps most prominently that some questions that you want answered can't be answered with a google search. A lot of the other functionality is built around facilitating their solution to that problem. They foster a community and social features in order to keep quality answerers engaged.<p>The last two are just ways of saying ""I don't like this"" and don't amount to threats to Quora's success. They have a serious brand, and this guy likes playful brands. It's not interesting to him because he hasn't added interesting topics to follow, and that's Quora's fault because they haven't suggested those topics to him. The subset of users who insist on playful brands and who just can't think of topics their interested in isn't big enough to bring down a company like Quora.<p>The suggestion, to turn Quora into Hacker News, would basically mean forgoing their purpose and vision in a last-ditch effort to leverage the community they've built. Not a smart idea (or a likely one).",1310947013

This is fine if you can be honest with yourself, recognize it for what it is and exit soon.  Otherwise you will get sucked in and your life will always be in this holding pattern (never quite willing to go ""all in"" with your business but never really doing what you really want to be doing.)<p>Think about the opportunity costs.  Many people going into freelance web development don't really want to be doing that.

2774531,comment,2774254,2774254,20,0,justin_vanw,,,"This professor is a huge part of the problem.  He's a tenured professor saying ""caring about cheating is counter productive"", which to me says ""I would rather have an easy life where I don't have to work hard than to protect the reputation of the institution I work for and ensure that students that graduate have learned something along the way"".<p>He complains he had to work almost 44 hours (2 hours * 22 cheaters) and repeatedly moans and bitches about how much time that is, despite being <i>spread over the course of an entire semester</i>.  I assume he's been in academia his whole career, because I can't remember a week where I've worked less than 50 hours.<p>My only solace is to know that this guy is a professor at a business school giving incredibly simplistic homework in excel, and his students are too stupid to do it.  I can't think of a better punishment for someone who puts his leisure and student assessments above academic integrity than to have students like that.<p>Finally, what is the value of his class at all?  If he can't tell his students are cheating without globally searching everything with this software, what are they supposedly learning?  I would favor just eliminating this class; if you can't tell whether a student took it or not, they didn't learn anything.  If you can't quantify the learning experience, it shouldn't carry credit.<p>This may be my strong bias as a Math major, but I know there is no way I could have cheated in almost any of my classes.  If I had copied someone's homework, either the professor would have recognized it right away (since most professors actually knew and cared about the students in their class), or I would have failed all the exams.  Do business school students not have exams that they can fail?  If not, what are they supposedly learning?  I know lots of business schools really drive their students hard to learn skills that they will use later.  My opinion of NYU's business school (where the author of this is a tenured professor) is now so low that I will do a bit more diligence on MBA students with a degree from there as I review resumes and gauge job candidates in the future.<p>Edit: removed something criticized as a personal insult.  This comment was modded up to 10, and at the time of this is now modded as 4.  There should be some kind of meta-karma for controversial posts, since they inject lively debate instead of just attempting to game the system!  That is my biased view anyway.",1310946350

I cheated ""better"" than the students in this post though, by copying sentence by sentence from various sources, rewriting it to make the cheating non-detectable, and reading over it to make sure the flow was good. It saved me at least 50% of the time compared to writing something from scratch, and the quality was good too.<p>Do I feel bad about it? Absolutely not.<p>It's imporant to consider why people cheat before you deem it bad. I cheated because the assignments were a waste of time. Plain and simple, a waste of time. It often felt like something the teacher gave us just so we shouldn't spend our evenings having fun. It wasn't something you were supposed to learn something from, it was something you were supposed to do because you were supposed to do it.<p>I should point out that that the Norwegian high school system is quite different from the American system. We couldn't choose our subjects, we had to take what the education law said we had to learn. Because of that I had a lot of subjects that I didn't have any interest in whatsoever, the only thing important was the grade I got. When you don't have any reason to study a subject other than to get a high number on a paper, it's natural to cheat. It's borderline impossible to be motivated to do something forced on you.<p>However, if the subject or course is your own choice, like the case with most university courses, cheating is something different. If the the only value the students get from a class is a grade and not relevant and valuable knowledge, I understand and sympathize with the cheaters.",1310944513

Good product managers don't insist on having things done their way, they insist on understanding what users want and managing a team towards solving the hard problems related to those user needs. The only reason Steve Jobs is successful in how he approaches product development is because he is the CEO. No other product manager I know of wields that sort of control over the product and the paycheck of those he works with.<p>Success comes from having the right people do the right things at the right time. I'd rather hire kick-ass product managers to help the rest of my product team do kick-ass things than insist that the team does it ""exactly my way"".<p>I'd probably quit if I worked for someone that forced the team to do it exactly his way...",1310943678

Looks like the more efficient method would have been to just reword the wikipedia article.<p>All of the stories about education bubbles, unemployed graduates, etc, seem to make a lot more sense when you see data like this.",1310943619

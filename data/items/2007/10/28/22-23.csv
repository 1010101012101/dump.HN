73538,comment,73505,73527,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I don't think we're doing <i>that</i> much processing to do vision. It's never the case that even close to all the cells in the visual cortex are being used. It's always a tiny fraction of that. Yeah, we have a bunch of cells that neuroscientists think are somehow related to doing vision, but there's no evidence that they're doing some kind of horribly computationally intensive thing all day long. If they were, we'd see it on MRI's as soon as we put a picture in front of somebody. <p>No, I think we just haven't figured out what to do, not that we're limited by computational resources. I think there are a bunch of pretty strong assumptions hardwired into the brain, so we can see physical objects, but then you can fool us by showing us images that mess with the assumptions (aka optical illusions). <p>(Not that this is a particularly useful idea, mind you. I'm not about to solve computer vision. It's just a random philosophical idea.)",1193611162

Anthropomorphic bias, right?<p>Even with this understanding, though, I can't wrap my brain around what you're saying above.

The real conversation should be how to rid the world of formality?  I personally feel ill every time I have to wear anything that others consider formal business wear.  I was a technical project manager (forgive me) for a few years and I felt like a traitor every time I sat with a group of engineers who all were wearing what makes us comfortable: GNU hacker t-shirts, jeans and Dr. Martens (or variations thereof).<p>When I see suits, I think of keywords like &quot;deceit&quot; and &quot;materialism&quot; and &quot;shallow&quot;.  I also feel like people in suits are being subjugated, no matter how high up the totem pole they think they are.  I grew up painfully poor, so I assume much of my opinion and reaction to seeing a suit comes from feeling the vast economic divide between me and people in suits, much the way I feel a sickness and anger when I see people in cars like Mercedes, BMW and Jaguar.<p>Suits make people think differently.

9476966,comment,9469789,9475724,0,0,blueprint,,,"Thank you for your consideration and time to reply.<p>May I be frank with you? After I read what you said, I became concerned for you. Although, you probably don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re in any level of danger at this late stage. However, my sole expression of concern for you might even raise the impetus within you to reject what I&#x27;m saying now. I just want to prepare you to notice such thing, if it is happening to you. There&#x27;s a reason that it would happen, which I&#x27;ll explain. However, I have some things to say which might sound odd at first or second listen. But I can promise you that they are true, and that the more you try to listen and understand, the more sense it will make.<p>Everything in the world is controlled by what is inside of itself. It&#x27;s impossible for anything in the world to exist, to come into existence, or to change after having come into existence without this law. What and how things act are determined by the problem made when what a thing keeps in itself contacts what exists in the world, whatever the case may be.<p>That&#x27;s why to suggest that one&#x27;s consciousness exists by default outside one&#x27;s body is like suggesting that the driver of a car stays outside of the car.<p>(Even if a hypothetical external driver gives orders to the car, those orders must be transmitted into some form of controller which exists within the system of the car, by way of direct connection.)<p>If the real owner of the car is outside of the car, then it&#x27;s quite convenient for any third parties to get into the driver&#x27;s seat and to drive on their own. How much more convenient for those third parties if the real owner believes that he is currently still the real driver? S/he wouldn&#x27;t feel a need to lock his/her car door, nor prevent any entrants.<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s actually quite detrimental to the health of the consciousness of a living person if it stays outside of their body, because it gets weaker very quickly that way.<p>While I don&#x27;t know you well, I can tell you not only from my continuous verifications, as well as additional research, but from my sufficient understanding of theory (i.e. law of operation) that any practices of meditation taught today make practitioners go in the exact opposite direction from awakening their consciousness and saving themselves, that is, enlightening themselves. In fact, meditation of today is the best way to (i) abandon and lose yourself, and (ii) to invite others&#x27; consciousnesses to drive you.<p>After having lost yourself, you won&#x27;t notice that it is the case because your consciousness exists in a state of dormancy, and what&#x27;s more, the other consciousnesses who have been able to enter and drive your body intentionally keep your own, original consciousness in that state of dormancy. The others inform you of things instead of allowing you to use your own consciousness to receive (see) things of the world.<p>There are many secrets in the world, and some of them are very profound. But because of the above, meditation is not the way for you to open your eyes to those secrets and to understand them. Meanwhile, it&#x27;s very convenient for roaming consciousnesses who do not have a body (because they have died already) to use the opportunity provided by your practice of meditation in order to show you things, and to subsequently trick you into believing that what they show you are indeed those secrets that you want to know. Those who are in this state are kept from realizing it. The dead consciousnesses who have to enter humans&#x27; bodies have to do so because of their attachment to life, and the problems they couldn&#x27;t solve while they were alive. After we die, we no longer have a physical body, so it&#x27;s quite a bit more difficult to change things in ourselves. That&#x27;s why they look for living people who they can deceive, enter, control, and use in order to express themselves.<p>Indeed, due to your practice of meditation, you probably feel more peaceful. However, if you don&#x27;t find any way break from their control, you will also encounter extremely difficult phenomena after you pass away, and will have a very hard time finding the way to come back to life as a human being again. Additionally, during your present life, as mentioned, you won&#x27;t be able to enlighten yourself through your meditation.<p>I&#x27;m telling you this in public at the risk of being ridiculed because it is all true (everything in reality is the proof of what I&#x27;m saying), and because it&#x27;s quite possible that no one else has informed you of these truths.<p>In order to confirm or disprove what I&#x27;ve said you&#x27;ve only got to look into facts and check. However, without checking, it will be extremely difficult for you to receive what I say. So, I hope you have an interest in saving yourself!",1430573660

9476898,comment,9475395,9476439,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"This is a funny one and it reminds me of gold.<p>We tend to think of gold valuable because it is pretty, and because it&#x27;s pretty we wear it, which gives it market value.<p>In reality, this is not untrue. But more importantly, we value gold because of scarcity, and that gives this not ugly looking metal value (there&#x27;s not enough gold in the world for everyone, after all). And because it is valuable, we think of it as pretty and wear it, because it shows a certain status. This is why we somehow perceive fake gold so negatively, not because it&#x27;s aesthetically different but because it&#x27;s worthless. We hide this fact with words like one is &#x27;authentic&#x27; and the other is not. While really, they look the same, and they&#x27;re both arbitrary metals, but one is scarce and thus not cheaply available for all, while the other is.<p>In fact, quite some time ago aluminium shared the role of gold, it was even scarcer (before factories produced it) and more expensive. You can find anecdotal evidence of this, e.g. Napoleon holding a banquet where the most expensive cutlery was made of aluminium for the special guests, and the regular guests had to use mere golden spoons. All of that ended when producing aluminium in a factory was discovered and the price plummeted from hundreds of dollars per some unit (can&#x27;t remember) to mere pennies. Today you&#x27;d look mostly foolish wearing an aluminium chain, mostly because it&#x27;s simply way less scarce.<p>That&#x27;s why I was reminded of it by your comment about suits. It&#x27;s likely true that we consider suits to be serious because they&#x27;re 1) uniforms and 2) simple, hard cuts<p>But at the same time, that&#x27;s just today&#x27;s fashion. In the early days of suits they were colourful, they had rounded shapes, they were also used as uniforms etc.<p>In other words, I think what actually makes them &#x27;serious&#x27; is the people wearing them. You can find a garbageman uniform, or make one, that&#x27;s cleaner and more modern and slicker than a suit. But we&#x27;d immediately attach negative connotations to that uniform. In the same way gold isn&#x27;t necessarily the prettiest thing, but because of meta-reasons (e.g. it being expensive, or worn by cool people), it&#x27;s desired. Suits are likely pretty similar. It&#x27;s the fact that important people wear suits that inspires the seriousness.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s just one hypothesis of course :)",1430572007

This prompted me to just go all the way and stop it altogether.<p>One big thing I saw drop was my anxiety. Anxiety has been passed down by my father, and while it&#x27;s somewhat mild in me, my dad & sister would be having panic attacks at my age. For me, I never went into a straight panic but it can be hard for me to feel safe. I&#x27;m a very hard worker with a lot of responsibility, so of course the anxiety has plenty to feed upon (&quot;This isn&#x27;t done, gotta do this, gotta do that.&quot;). Coffee would fuel that kind of behavior as if it were some kind of battle and take it all on. Then when the inevitable crash came, I would have to be looking to supplement it.<p>Like I said, I&#x27;m only a week in but what the OP says about waking up is very true and probably my favorite aspect of quitting coffee. I&#x27;ll wake up at 6:30 and wanna just get up. When 11 or 12 rolls around, I fall asleep very naturally and wouldn&#x27;t be able to stay awake even if I wanted to. It&#x27;s worth a shot for everyone. Unlike the OP, I went completely cold turkey on the caffeine I should mention.",1430571961

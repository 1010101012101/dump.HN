The article cited[1] quotes indigenous populations in North and South America dropping by 97% and 93% before 1570 in the centuries since, it has become statistically improbable that any Native Americans descendants exist who don't share a European ancestor with you.<p>Now it comes from a computer model, so there could be errors or exceptions I'm thinking extant uncontacted peoples, here. The model accounted for this possibility, as the paper notes: <i>...in order for a remote island to affect the MRCA
date, it must have been colonized prior to the lineage of
the mainland MRCA reaching the source population and
it must have remained genetically isolated until very re-
cently in order for there to be surviving people with no
modern mainland ancestry.</i><p>Remember that uncontacted peoples are uncontacted by <i>us</i>; the ones we know of have regular if infrequent contact with other tribes, so if contacted tribes share the MRCA it's quite probable that uncontacted ones do as well. Could there be a cache of 50-100 human beings somewhere on this planet who happen to share an MRCA with us who is older than the one shared by all other living persons, maybe 10,000 years? Sure. But they would be the only ones out of 7 billion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Papers/Rohde-MRCA-two.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Papers/Rohde-MRCA-two.pdf</a>",1312653567

Said friend had a product idea and was eager to invest a few thousand dollars into an MVP but does not have a programming background.  He insisted on majority ownership and ""just needed someone to build it"".  I told him that he needed to be more respectful of the fact that the product he wanted to sell was a PIECE OF SOFTWARE.  Though a lot of people here will tell you about the importance of user acquisition, etc. the software in a software business cannot be regarded as secondary.  My breakdown of his options I presented to him is below:<p>(1) solicit quotes -- if you get one that you can stomach from someone not in a third-world country, go with it, but I wouldn't be too hopeful.<p>(2) Consider partnering with a young and ambitious person with technical ability, and be prepared to give him at least 50% percent ownership in respect of his 100% authorship of the product that is at the core of your business.<p>(3) Do it your damn self.  This is what I most strongly suggest and there's a massive community out there eager to give you assistance and encouragement.  You could truly own the thing AND not be vulnerable to your technical co-founder/serf deciding he doesn't like you and wants to, say, expose all user data and get you sued and/or arrested.<p>Furthermore, it's very, very fun: (resources I pointed my friend to below.  note: friend was interested in building an iPhone app)

The latest measurements from insider the reactors indicates that core material is exposed outside the pressure vessel. The basis for that is several sieverts of radiation they are measuring in those areas. And those levels would not be produced by byproducts in water sadly.<p>So on the one hand we can be impressed that only the oldest two reactors in Japan, sitting at the epicenter of the biggest natural disaster Japan has ever experienced has had this failure. Other newer reactors on the same site were successfully shut down and made safe. But the 1 & 2 reactors  have it would seem failed completely. Right out past the limits of their safety system. (if the reactor vessel ruptured, and it seems like it has)<p>That makes cleanup that much harder, it makes the likely hood that the site of those reactors being re-used is zero. And it means that TEPCO is going to probably go bankrupt based on the costs.<p>What it <i>doesn't mean</i> is that the folks in Fukushima are in any more danger now then they were 5 months ago. It doesn't mean that the radiation will 'escape' and kill people, or even that anyone will die. It doesn't mean that the surrounding area is in danger of more contamination.<p>I was more interested in the way folks were measuring radioactive fallout on a much finer scale using 'home made' measurement devices. This crowd sourced contamination map can help track down where contaminants have been concentrated in the surrounding area and become a problem. That is, in my opinion, the more impactful problem to address.

We wanted this change to be transparent to people who have production code that interacts with the API, so it wasn't the appropriate time to change that. On the other hand, for people developing future APIs, we've added extra feedback in a way that doesn't affect other customers' code. I agree that it's not the best solution, but you have to make these kinds of compromises when you have real customers.",1312650974

The C10k document was released in 1999.  That is 12 years we've known how to handle 10k concurrent connections (bare in mind this is not the exact use case mentioned above).  Twisted came out a similar time ago.  Libevent dates back to at least 2005.  Erlang first appeared in 1986, and Erlang was just abstracting how people were already solving concurrency issues into a language.  This stuff is not hidden or elite or privileged information.  How is it that your average HNer can spout off reasons why NoSQL is claimed to be superior to an RDBMS for <i>scalability</i> yet doesn't seem to know the fundamental concepts?  Our education is indeed failing the current generation of programmers if they don't know the basics for a topic that the internet is flooded with.<p>Finally, I didn't say ""ruby is too slow and doesn't scale"", I pointed out that the various issues with doing things fast in Ruby have been known for a long time, even to someone only following Ruby.  What I did say was that the basic approach the original commentor chose is known to not scale (which it didn't).  This is a fundamentally different approach than the VMWare product you mentioned which has chosen a solution similar to Twisted.  This approach is known to scale far superior to the original solution.",1312650888

Seeing how this new Gmail app is a bunch of Web views and needlessly non-standard widgets (=> part of the worst dredge of apps), it makes me start to feel pretty cynical about their iOS strategy.<p>Then again, taken the experience using the Android browser while developing mobile websites, maybe it's an institutional inability to develop polished mobile applications.",1320256791

Some people like this switch type, some people do not.<p>But if you're to say something like ""it's easily better than a laptop keyboard"" you can only make such a claim based on size or number/position of keys, since both use the same switch type.

Not by orders of magnitude, but enough to be annoying.<p>I used to exclusively work at two 24"" monitors. Then I switched to a tiling WM and from many years on OS X back to Fedora. I found that the WM/OS switch improved my productivity to the point that I was better off on a 15"" laptop with those two changes than before them on two monitors. And the setup was around $2,000 cheaper.<p>Now my ideal setup is a single large monitor along with familiar peripherals (Kinesis, trackball), xmonad, and Linux. If you'd told me a year ago that I'd be happier with one monitor than two--or nearly as happy on a laptop as a desktop--I'd have said you were nuts. But, here we are.<p>I agree that the difference in productivity between the worst-case (Mac laptop) and best-case (Large monitor; peripherals; xmonad) is not orders of magnitude. But I would say that over time it has come to approach 2x, which is not at all insignificant.<p>And I think ""expense"" matters little compared to ""comfort"". If a keyboard that didn't cost $250 was just as comfortable for me, I'd buy it. In the case of this particular switch (laptop -> linode), the comfort level would be close for most tasks as I already live in Vim and things with Vim-like bindings. But the totally new window/peripheral interface would definitely slow me down. I've spent enough years comparing environments over long periods of time to know that.",1320255600

We've tried a variety of tools for task management and project planning: Basecamp, GitHub issues, Pivotal. With each of these tools, up until Asana, we didn't find it helped our team very much.<p>Asana has changed all that. Our whole team, including BD/Sales, have been using Asana to coordinate various tasks. The biggest thing: Asana is _fast_. It doesn't get in your way! You can tab over and add a task in less than the time it takes to even load the tasks page on something like BaseCamp. Some additional features that make it great:<p>* Followers - You can add followers to a task if you want other people involved. This emails them and notifies them of the task.<p>* Comments - Comment streams are very nice. They provide a nice timeline of activities happening on a task.<p>* Keyboard shortcuts - I never touch the mouse in Asana. Ever. And this increases productivity by tons. You can fly around multiple projects, tasks, etc in seconds.<p>So there is some reasoning behind our use of Asana, here are some reasons we didn't like other options:<p>* BaseCamp - Had all the features we wanted, but it got in the way too much. No keyboard shortcuts, slow page loads, etc. Taking 30 seconds to add a task == too slow.<p>* GitHub issues - All the issues are on each separate repo. It is difficult to quickly navigate between them and to get other people in the company to look at them.<p>* Pivotal - The UI was completely non-intuitive to us and didn't jive with the way we wanted to work. We didn't want a tool that forced us to work with IT, we wanted a tool to work with US.<p>That being said, I wish there were some other features that Asana would implement:<p>* Dependent tasks - It is not possible right now to have a hierarchy of tasks towards various goals. This makes it weird to have one big task that is like ""Ship the whole product v1"" then have a ton of little tasks that are related but not obviously so.<p>* Multiple assignees - There are some tasks that just make sense to have multiple assignees.<p>Hope that helps.<p>Mitchell",1320253414

Typically, the curriculum for history is made to match some political agenda (even if you'd claim that it's not so, it is in fact always so with the history taught in schools). Making it adhering to the agenda necessary results in some awkward perspectives or unbalanced attention to really relevant or really interesting events.<p>To quote Bertha von Suttner in ""Lay Down Your Arms,"" 1889:<p>""Speaking generally it is history which, as our youth are 
instructed, is the chief source of the admiration of war. From 
thence it is stamped on the childish mind that the Lord of 
armies is constantly decreeing battles, that these are, as it were, the vehicle upon which the destiny of nations is carried on through the ages ; that they are the fulfilment of an inevitable law of nature and must always occur from time to time like storms at sea or earthquakes ; that terror and woe are indeed connected with them ; but the latter is fully counterpoised, for the commonwealth by the importance of the results, for individuals by the blaze of glory which may be won in them, or even by the consciousness of the fulfilment of the most elevated duty. Can there be a more glorious death than that on the field of honour, a nobler immortality than that of the hero? All this comes out clear and unanimous in all school-books ""readings for the use of schools,"" where, besides the formal 
history, which is only represented as a concatenation of military events, even the separate tales and poems always manage to tell only of heroic deeds of arms. This is a part of the patriotic system of education. Since out of every scholar a defender of his country has to be formed, therefore the enthusiasm even of the child must be aroused for this its first duty as a citizen; his spirit must be hardened against the natural horror which the terrors of war might awaken, by passing over as quickly as possible the story of the most fearful massacres and butcheries as of something quite common and necessary, and laying meanwhile all possible stress on the ideal side of this ancient national custom; and it is in this way they have succeeded in forming a race eager for battle and delighting in war.""",1320253323

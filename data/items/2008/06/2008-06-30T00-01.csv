I'd like to learn Emacs, first of all because it seems (from an outside viewpoint) to be slightly more powerful, but also because it has a few features I'd like to be able to use.<p>I started trying to learn Emacs yesterday, but I find that everything I do doesn't get anything done, and beating my head against it doesn't help.<p>Does anyone have any suggestions or tips on how to get up to speed on usage of Emacs as fast as possible? Maybe a like to a ""N00B Guide"" or something?<p>Thanks.",1214787445

231583,comment,231153,231568,0,0,smanek,,,"That's a fair point. I've met many people that are ostensibly muslim or jewish and are perfectly reasonable and intelligent.<p>But, I've never really gotten a good answer on which parts of the said holy books followers are free to disregard.<p>Can I ignore anything I disagree with and still be considered an X? If so, what meaning does X really have and why should I consider myself an X? If not, then who gets to decide which parts of the holy book I can ignore, and by what authority?<p>The 'party line' that I usually receive is that every word of the holy books is true, but we must interpret it properly. However, there are huge portions of the the old testament and quaran that unambiguously advocate violence and intolerance (I can dig up example if you like). They really don't leave much room for interpretation.<p>To the best of my knowledge, religions/philosophies have a core set of beliefs that define them. I understand that there is some latitude, but once you stray a certain distance from a religion's core, I'd argue you are no longer a member of that religion. And, based on my readings of the quaran and old testament, I'd say that violence and intolerance are part of the core of islam and judaism.<p>By way of analogy, libertarians hold a very wide spectrum of beliefs. For example, two libertarians could disagree on whether or not elementary schools should be publicly funded. But, when one of them contends that all private profit should be taken and redistributed, I'd posit that he's no longer a libertarian because he has strayed too far from the core principles.",1214786962

231579,comment,230347,230602,0,0,KiwiNige,,,"The biggest problems faced by the two consultingware shops I've worked at, is that they thought they were product based shops and every design desision reflected that. But the product became so complicated that every client had there own special configuration and no-one really understood them all at the same time. It became very common to make a change for one client and break a feature for someone else when they upgraded.<p>IMO they would have been much better off to embrace consultingware and plan for it.",1214785901

I don't think I'm on-board with this argument, or his assertion that significantly more people are using Mono than git.<p>I find bug trackers satisfying, generally, but then again, I make money from my software--it's almost entirely Open Source, but nonetheless, my prosperity depends on the software being great.  Anyway, closing out bugs is an enjoyable part of the job, and I simply can't keep up with things that come in via email or in the forums.  I think there's a volume-of-issues-to-developers mismatch between my projects (which have two or three developers, tops, plus a few occasional contributors) and something like git (which has a primary maintainer, a few regular developers, and dozens of occasional contributors).",1214784736

231562,comment,230955,231444,0,0,gruseom,,,"I don't think English works this way. The Buffalo and have/had examples are clearly valid (if extreme) sentences and their meaning leaps out once you see the trick. ""Fish fish eat eat"" does too, and so would ""Fish fish eat eat fish"". But you can't arbitrarily nest these clauses, and ""fish fish fish eat eat eat"" doesn't click for me. The suggested analogy, ""Mice cats dogs chase eat sleep"", seems accurate as an analogy because it's invalid in the same way; that is, ""Cats dog chase eat"" is clearly ok, but the next step of nesting is not. It would be interesting to pin down the reason.",1214784109

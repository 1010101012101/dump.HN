2666220,comment,2665254,2665689,2,0,abrenzel,,,"I think a lot of conventional analysis of investments is looking more foolish than usual because the market isn't keying off what people think it is.  Three major things have dominated market movements since the 2008 crisis:<p>1) Rock-bottom interest rates (and a depreciating dollar)
2) Quantitative easing
3) Enormous deficit spending<p>All of these things, through mechanisms both simple and complex, have driven money into equities and speculative investments such as start-ups.<p>While interest rates will remain low for quite a long time and deficits will no doubt continue, QE2 expires at the end of the month.  Additionally, the proportion of the deficit is moving away from stimulus into structural spending such as Medicare.  The natural response by the major market players is profit taking.  Hence, the IPOs at bubble-like valuations (LinkedIn, Pandora, etc) are running into the teeth of a ""smart money"" evacuation of the stock market.<p>If the Fed and government overcome political pressure against further loose policy (always possible if the economy continues to weaken), then I imagine the LNKDs and Ps of the world will pop back up to the eye-watering valuations they attained at the time of their IPOs.<p>If national fiscal/monetary policy continues to tighten, then the bubble will have been ended before it really began.  In which case, LNKD and P will continue to decline, and I would not be surprised to see some of the other hot properties like Zynga delay their market entries.  The market for VC funding will also become substantially tighter.",1308329984

The person has their own freelance business, so unlikely to join fulltime later. They expressed interest in helping with my project on contract (which I can't afford) or equity basis. The help would be in terms of basic MVP to get going. The startup is very consumer/sales focused and not tech/software based.<p>I'm early stage with zero-funding, so I'd like to pay in equity, But as this is not about equity between fulltime cofounders, I'm not sure how to approach this. And this is not regular parttime either, it's more of a finite amount to be done upfront. Are there any good rules of thumb, proxies or templates to use in calculating equity-work exchange rate?<p>I am concerned about getting this right in order to prevent equity issues with potential employees or fulltime cofounders (I have none yet) and VC in future.",1308329702

2666158,comment,2665254,2665682,7,0,dxbydt,,,"When you model equities as log-normal ie. log(stock price) is normally distributed, and then use the geometric brownian motion to model the underlying, which spits out derivative prices using Black-Scholes. 
The problem is that normal distribution is thin-tailed ie. 5 sigma events are extremely rare.
So use a fat tailed distribution - which is what Mandelbrot did. He used a power-law ( Pareto ) distribution because its infinite variance permitted wider swings in price than the Gaussian. However the simplicity of using a Normal distribution is what makes Black Scholes so robust. If a thousand statisticians look at market data over a time window & model it to fit a lognormal usaing MLE, they'll come up with approximately the same parameters, so calibration is relatively easy. In fact this is one of the standard exercises in any MFE pgm - to calibrate a derivatives model corresponding to underlying data over a time window.
With Mandelbrot's Paretian distribution, calibration is virtually impossible. No two people get the same parameters given the same data points on a Paretian model. There is quite a bit of literature on this very topic, in both Taleb's last book & elsewhere. Mandelbrot points out how given different time windows, the Paretian distribution can be calibrated to fit virtually anything, but the parameters will change wildly.<p>Essentially, given the choice between an inaccurate robust simple Gaussian model with high predictive power and a supposedly accurate but un-usable Paretian model, financial engineers choose the former & add fudge-factor explanations ( eg. the vol-smile ) to augment the data.<p>1. <a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/justinfox/2010/10/18/why-didn%E2%80%99t-people-in-finance-pay-attention-to-benoit-mandelbrot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.reuters.com/justinfox/2010/10/18/why-didn%E2%80...</a>

But this has a couple of problems that I can think of:<p>1. Per-device reputation removes the concept of anonymity.  If I can look up the ""reputation"" of the device that sent me a packet, I can track it perfectly too.<p>2. Authenticating every device (beside the practical challenges) is very inconvenient.  What happens if I move countries?  Buy a new phone?  Or a new network card?<p>And there's more issues that I won't list :)<p>Problems aside, I agree with the statement: ""the underlying assumption [...] that anyone anywhere on the network should be able to drop an unlimited amount of data onto the link headed to me [...] needs to be justified"".<p>I think the most practical solution to this would simply be forcing ISPs (through legislation would be best) to look a little closer at their traffic.  If I'm running an ISP, and I see a computer making 100 requests/second to a single website for more than a minute, I'm immediately thinking ""DDOS"".  Yes, there's privacy issues, but most ISPs already do some sort of traffic shaping (see: Sandvine), so it shouldn't be that much of a stretch.<p>Arguments welcome ;-)",1308327530

If those drivers are so buggy, why isn't this a high priority to fix? It would probably be easier for hackers to attack other things due to the wide range of drivers but if the security issues claims against WebGL are real then escalation of privileges on any OS is a question of breaking the GPU driver.<p>I find that to be a big issue even with WebGL not in the picture.",1308326550

2665998,comment,2665607,2665859,4,0,nddrylliog,,,"We would've loved to have that too when porting the mad code.<p>Here's a quick overview:<p>bytestream is our general I/O abstract class - there's much room for improvement because it works with Strings. substream allows to have a 'view' of a slice of a bytestream.<p>filestream and ajaxstream are two implementations of bytestream, doing local File I/O (with the upcoming W3C File API) and XMLHttpRequest streaming. On Firefox 4.0+, ajaxstream takes advantage of mozBinaryResponse and uses Uint8Array(s) to 1) compute the amount of data read, and 2) implement getU8 (which is used a lot).<p>bit.js is a straight port of libmad's bit manipulation routines. Bit-level I/O is a must-have in an MP3 decoder because you have numbers stored on 7 bytes, 19 bytes, and other weird stuff like this (especially in the huffman decoding part).<p>huffman.js, imdct_s.js, rq_table.js are all tables used somewhere else in the process.<p>layer3.js is really the central part. it implements huffman decoding, the various IMDCT transforms, reordering, requantizing... all sorts of magic tricks I didn't fully grasp even while porting. Comparing the output was really our best weapon. The libmad guys are really the reference guys for this kind of question. We had to strip out all their fixed-point stuff because it's really of no use in Javascript, since JS only has floating point numbers - even if we can make them <i>behave</i> almost as integers, it's still as costly as FP arithmetic so we just went floating point all the way - hence, jsmad doesn't have 24-bit output like libmad has. libmad is wayyyy better at everything :)<p>synth.js is the second central part - it synthesizes the sound waves from the decoded MPEG Layer-III data. It's the most expensive part of the project, since it's just thousand meaningless arithmetic operations, something JavaScript doesn't excel at.<p>mad.js contains mostly constants (errors), a few utility functions<p>decoder.js isn't used anywhere, it's my attempt to port decoder.c from libmad, but it's unfinished.<p>player.js is our ill-fated attempt to play the decoded MP3 correctly - it's really naive (no seeking, stutter in some cases, no buffering of decoded frames, etc.)",1308326520

We have pretty good speech recognition for human language (plus acceptable speech synthesis). Assuming dolphins have a smaller vocabulary than humans, speech recognition of dolphins should strictly speaking be a simpler problem (although it would be significantly harder to record the training data).",1308326493

Like Google advertising, where the ads are selected based on the textual context -- words in your search string or email or website -- but instead of ads as the output, short video clips. For long text blocks, run the videos alongside a scrolling reader such that the video and text stay synchronized. The word ""respect"" prompts an Aretha Franklin clip, maybe. Appeal to the [people who think they are] multitaskers! You'll have nerd users searching for which Shakespearean passages lead to the most amusing clip playlist!<p>If the video bandwidth is all Youtube's, and the UI is Javascript, your ongoing cost is mostly the server time to run the text against your corpus and spit out a playlist.<p>I love when startup ideas spring from a misinterpretation of how someone else summarizes their product.",1308326465

I suppose it may be worth it if you're primarily focused on getting noticed in the short term (perhaps to get investment or a good job offer), but long term it seems to guarantee that the project will need to go through a rename with all the confusion that entails.<p>Edit: Forgot to say the technology really is amazing.",1308326459

In both advanced individual training (the job specific one that follows the famous &quot;basic training&quot;) and before deploying to Afghanistan, I underwent a good amount of tactical and combat training. In both situations we were not only taught proper protocols for &quot;escalation of force&quot; and &quot;rules of engagement&quot; but also threatened with doom if we didn&#x27;t follow them.<p>It varies on many factors, but generally before pulling the trigger you have to visually identify a threat, yell a verbal warning, show your weapon as a warning, fire a warning shot, aim at the threat and repeat the verbal warning, then fire if necessary.<p>Obviously this doesn&#x27;t apply to full-combat situations, but for instances of the type that our domestic police force encounter, it most certainly would. It&#x27;s so ingrained that I always wonder how we have so many occurrences of police shootings.<p>Sad situation, especially because (imho) the vast majority of police are amazing, selfless, community minded heroes, whose profession is besmirched by these brutal thugs who share their uniform.",1449795594

I don&#x27;t think there is one ... although the internet will surely correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>The original source that I often return to (even before I look in my book) is Wendland&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;Scattered Data Approximation&quot;.  But that book is really tough to read, even for me.  Lots of tough math.  Fasshauer&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;Meshfree Approximation Methods in Matlab&quot; is much easier to read, but references Wendland&#x27;s book for most of the heavy lifting.<p>There is a newer branch of study on convergence dealing with what are called &quot;sampling inequalities&quot;.  In many ways, the math behind these is even worse as it usually requires a bunch of polynomial theory, but the results are more easily accessible.  In particular, Christian Rieger and Barbara Wolmuth have outstanding content on this which is readily available on the web.  In particular, I was able to find Christian&#x27;s PhD thesis (<a href=""https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/binary/JOWXLCGSV4NBOC5ZMLW553MRS6X65BFB/full/1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/binary/JOWXLCGSV...</a>) which provides a good journey from the start to actual results.<p>Sorry I can&#x27;t provide a cleaner statement about this.  Maybe the most basic point I can make about convergence here would be to reference the early part of Christian&#x27;s thesis where he alludes to the theorem that says the quality of an interpolant sort of looks like:<p>error of interpolant = O(h^{k-d})<p>That is a gross simplification, but gives the gist of the result.  h is the &quot;fill distance&quot; (or grid width for structured data) k is the smoothness of the kernel and d is the dimension of the data.  This indicates why smooth kernels (large k) are needed to get the convergence for high d.",1449795406

If you were working on a full time basis, you never had to fund the business on your credit card, and even if Atlassian went bankrupt the day before the IPO and plunged to $0 in value, you still got to keep A$1.4m of the A$1.6m.<p>You got to become a millionaire if you saved and invested well, while minting a billionaire.

This is a classic economic signalling behaviour, akin to getting a college degree in order to signal your intelligence or giving gifts in order to signal your wealth.<p>Consider two possible YCs: YC(a) is serious about having female and minority founders at office hours, while YC(b) is just trying to be politically correct.  Advertising &quot;we encourage female and minority founders to apply&quot; wouldn&#x27;t cost anything.  Advertising &quot;we will only accept female / minority founders in these months&quot; in contrast has a cost -- they lose the opportunity to meet truly awesome founders who do not belong to the appropriate group -- but for YC(a) that cost is partially balanced by the fact that they&#x27;re spending time talking to members of groups which they would like to help out.  Thus the net cost for YC(a) is lower than the net cost for YC(b) -- just like getting a college degree takes less effort for someone who is highly intelligent than it does for someone who is less intelligent -- and so YC communicates to founders that they are more likely to be YC(a) than YC(b).<p>(Whether anyone thought it through to this extent, I don&#x27;t know.  But people routinely engage in signalling behaviours without being aware that they are doing so.)",1449795257

You&#x27;re on the right path, there&#x27;s a lot you can do to slow down the progress of the disease.<p>I&#x27;m not a doctor however so take any advice with a grain of salt. (But not sugar, definitely not that.)<p>> I keep reading that the problem is carbohydrate overload to my genetics.<p>Read up on &quot;glycemic index&quot;. This index tells you how close your food is to pure glucose e.g. table sugar has a glycemic index of 68 so it has 68% of the insulin response of pure glucose. The index correlates to the type of carbohydrate and how processed it is, although there are some surprises e.g. premium ice cream has a G.I. of 37.<p><a href=""http://www.glycemicindex.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glycemicindex.com/index.php</a><p>You don&#x27;t have to commit the entire index to memory. Usually you can come up with several heuristics e.g. tropical fruit tends to have higher G.I. than temperate fruit.<p>Obviously you should test this with your own blood sugar readings as individual response to a carbohydrate challenge can be quite different.<p>The other components to a meal also affect blood sugar. For example, acid, protein and fat tend to slow down digestion and thus blood sugar spiking. If you must take pasta for example, take it with a tomato-based sauce (acidic) rather than cream-based. YMMV.<p>> Unfortunately, my doctor thinks that pushing pills is an adequate response, which I heartily doubt.<p>It&#x27;s important, although somewhat depressing, to see this disease as a progression. A progression that you have to slow down as much as possible, but still a progression.<p>Know that in the future, you may have to resort to the first line of pills, and then possibly stronger ones. Try to slow down the progression as much as possible, and research the pills to see their efficacy and benefit.<p>Metformin is usually the first line of defence and it has a long history and little side effect. It generally fools your body into thinking it&#x27;s in starvation mode, which means you can lose weight, both fat and muscle. It actually lowers insulin resistance rather than increasing insulin. Generally in amounts >1g it gives you loose bowels, so when you have to use it keep on low doses as long as possible.<p>When metformin doesn&#x27;t work as well, generally you&#x27;ll get prescribed sulfonylureas. Since they increase insulin secretion, they tend to exacerbate your insulin resistance. There is some inconclusive research that they burn out the pancreatic beta cells. Better to avoid these as long as possible, but if your glucose control is bad you may not have a choice.<p>I&#x27;m currently on an incretin enhancer (gliptin) + metformin.<p>Also look up supplements on examine.com. It&#x27;s hard to tell the effectiveness of supplements, the only one that had a distinct effect on me was berberine.<p>The other thing you can do is exercise. Lots of it. Strength training for more muscle and more insulin receptors. Aerobic exercise to burn/absorb more glucose and lose weight. There&#x27;s even recent evidence that high-intensity interval training improves diabetic markers more than sustained, low-intensity exercise.",1449794056

And I&#x27;ll define &quot;fitness effect&quot; as the advantage conferred by a particular mutation <i>in a particular fitness landscape.</i> e.g., If you&#x27;re an E. coli, the fitness conferred by penicillin resistance is very high if you&#x27;re sitting in a pool of penicillin, but generally mildly negative otherwise because you&#x27;re wasting energy.<p>When the fitness effect size is <i>much larger</i> in magnitude than 1/Ne (or 1/2Ne if you&#x27;re diploid, like us), the fate of the gene is largely determined by natural selection. (But add the occasional coin toss in there b/c the real world is messy.)<p>When the fitness effect size is <i>much smaller</i> in magnitude than 1/Ne, the fate of the gene is largely determined by genetic drift. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift</a> (tl;dr Mostly chance mod a few other effects, like if the mutation of interest has a physical location close to another mutation with strong selection pressure)<p>However, there are <i>slightly</i> deleterious or <i>slightly</i> advantageous mutations, whose fitness effect size is close to 1/Ne (or 1/2Ne for diploids), and things get kinda interesting, because it&#x27;s a combination of genetic drift and natural selection. For instance, if it&#x27;s a slightly deleterious mutation, it will decrease Ne slightly (increasing the proportion of mutations that are considered neutral of the new value of Ne), and the previously &quot;slightly deleterious&quot; mutation may now be effectively neutral for the new value of Ne.<p>There is a lot of evidence that the &quot;slightly&quot; deleterious and the &quot;slightly&quot; advantageous mutations contribute substantially to evolutionary dynamics.<p>This is further complicated by the fact that the fitness (whether a mutation is deleterious or advantageous) is not constant everywhere geographically, or over time.",1449793710

We could assign syntax to a system composed of whatever thing and say that is Turing-complete or that follows the productions A->B and B->BB of G_1, an imaginary grammar, just because we can assign to it certain symbols as inputs and others as outputs. Numbers, symbols, don&#x27;t exist in the real world. Math entities only exist as syntax, as human artifacts. They&#x27;re language entities. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re based on axioms.<p>I don&#x27;t see the point in saying that syntax is physical - I mean, the neurons firing in our brains because of photons getting in our eyes explain how I recognized the shape of a car, not that a &#x27;hypothetical 2D array&#x27; gets &#x27;processed&#x27; with some &#x27;gradient-based algorithm&#x27; unconsciously in our brain. It doesn&#x27;t make biological sense. Turing didn&#x27;t even defined what a symbol or a computation is in terms of Physics, he just made a (very cool and beautiful, by the way) model.<p>Chomsky is simply wrong. He&#x27;s just thinking here that language is suddenly physical, that we have a grammar-processing CPU in our brains, a form of a Universal Turing Machine! Can this number, &#x27;1&#x27;, be physically somewhere in the world, taking in account modern physics and not some weird Platonism? or we just use it as language to refer to physical entities to talk about them? I do think the latter is the truth. Grammars are math entities which we sometimes use to refer to certain things written in books or other spoken things that just happen to have some physical shape in form of sound waves (words) or even to refer to an imaginary entity we&#x27;ve created with math, just like abstract machines. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s some weird computational thing going on in my head, that&#x27;s just an oxymoron. Just neurons firing, blood being pumped, neurotransmitters being sent, in all its glorious and mysterious nature. The mind, on the other hand, exists as a high-level feature of some parts of the bigger brain system, it&#x27;s caused by real things; that mind that lets us do conscious calculations. But that &#x27;Universal Grammar&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t be inside my mind anyway because it&#x27;s supposed to be unconscious. It wouldn&#x27;t be a feature of the mind-spanning parts of the brain anyway.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s just the whole Nietzschean critique of mistaking language with reality all over again.<p>I cannot recommend John Searle&#x27;s work on the subject enough, like the book &#x27;The Rediscovery Of The Mind&#x27;. He explains all of this way way better than me.<p>P.S: Yes, if you think hard about it, this logically implies that a Strong AI won&#x27;t ever exist.

We have numerous comments claiming that police should just put up with serious risks to their lives, which is ridiculous. The risks that e.g. deepwater oil workers face are inherent to current oil drilling technology. Though such workers are paid enough to accept those risks, safety technology is always improving. In contrast, <i>every</i> risk involved in police work is due to arbitrary decisions society has made, which could be changed at any time if we cared enough to do so. It&#x27;s no wonder that police have responded with a bunker mentality.<p><i>Society</i> has invented numerous victimless crimes, many of which attempt to counteract basic psychological and physical drives. <i>Society</i> has outlawed &quot;risky&quot; behaviors rather than punishing actual harms caused by those. <i>Society</i> has given municipalities, agencies, and contractors commercial interest in draconian enforcement. <i>Society</i> has decided to employ multitudes more police than we actually need, so that they are forced to menace the public in order to make work for themselves.<p>My suggestion for a maxim of policing would be to follow physicians: &quot;first, do no harm&quot;.

In the mean time back to reading, board games, hobbies, parks, exercise, etc.. they don&#x27;t cost a penny. If everyone disconnected for a few months you would realize that there is life beyond these time wasting distractions. The best things in life are free anyway.",1449792096

My annoyance with evil is that `xp` doesn&#x27;t work, my annoyance with ideavim is that the `{` text object is scope based instead of text based. I&#x27;ve had Esc not work correctly under some circumstances in both (I use c-[ instead) and neither supports iskeyword so * doesn&#x27;t search for identifier in skewer-case languages.",1449792049

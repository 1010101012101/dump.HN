That's a 19th century superstition. For example, if something as basic as the price you pay for oil is determined by the wars your country fights then there's no free market. If your government prints inflated money at will. No free market. If the banking sector gets a 1 trillion dollar bailout. No free market. If a company or a lobby can buy several senators. No free market. If there is copyright and intellectual property rights. No free market. If your country can force others via military and diplomatic might to enforce favorable trade agreements. No free market. Heck, even if recreational drugs are illegal: no free market.<p>And even if it was, it wouldn't be working in this area. When you're dying you don't negotiate prices.",1361588391

Scientific understanding depends on quality of the science, not the reputation of the scientist. It also doesn't depend on faith, but on experiments and observations that can be reproduced.<p>We use this method because it's the most reliable way we know to arrive at answers that give us predictive power about how our world works, rather than just answers that ""feel right"". An answer that feels right may still be right, but that doesn't make it scientific.<p><i>Your assertion that my experience is a placebo effect is based on your faith in Qi being unreal.</i><p>You seem to be interpreting the placebo effect to mean ""unreal"", but our present scientific understanding is that the placebo effect <i>is</i> real.<p>To put it another way: Nobody is denying your subjective experience. It's the attribution of that experience to mysterious mechanisms that require faith for observation that is incompatible with scientific understanding, not the experience itself.<p>This is important when you're suggesting that science excludes some things from study -- what it actually excludes are things that can't be studied scientifically, such as vaguely defined hidden dimensions or energies. It's like trying to hammer nails into air: you have the hammer, the nails, and plenty of air, but no matter how hard you swing, there's nothing for the nail to be driven into.<p><i>They're not so subtle if you train yourself to be aware of them. But to train yourself to be aware of them you can't have faith in their nonexistence.</i><p>This faith requirement is incompatible with your desire for more study on the subject.

Your card details are encrypted on a server somewhere. A transaction consists of a record of sale that is signed by the merchant's private key, sent to your card, which then signs it with your private key.<p>Said package of data is delivered up to Visa's servers. Your digital signature is validated with your public key, merchant's key is validated, the order goes through. Yes this requires an internet connection, yes it breaks offline processing. It also cuts fraud to 0.<p>Online purchases get more complicated, sure. Lazy way is to have something running on client machine that can sign data downloaded from merchant, make it a browser plugin or even better a standard all browsers implement, so long as the private key is stored somewhere and can be applied to a message. This is not exactly a hard problem. Doing it right is tricky, thankfully a good number of correct implementations already exist. Use one of those.<p>A more secure solution, especially for PCs, is to have a dongle, everything is processed on card. Then even if the PC is rooted 50 ways to Sunday all orders are still secure.<p>This is no more convoluted (and many would argue less) than the current way by which credit card orders are processed.<p>Credit Card companies currently place the entire burden of fraud onto merchants. They don't really have a reason to care about fraud, other than that it is bad customer service to have your customer's identity stolen.<p>The real problem here is how to deal with crap like reoccurring payments. Too many organizations are used to a workflow where in they store your credit card number. That is obviously insecure (see: news stories that come out all the time). I am not sure how to solve that particular problem though. Obviously it is a big blocker to getting a more secure system implemented!",1361585308

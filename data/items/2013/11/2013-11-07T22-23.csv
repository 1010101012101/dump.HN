6693076,comment,6692190,6692190,2,0,BrianEatWorld,,,"Does this really solve the problem?<p>I imagine most of these complaints come from people who pick up the extensions via bundling (not opting out of something when installing software). As those bundles run off of executables with admin privileges in Windows, the last change was circumvented simply by altering some files in the user&#x27;s chrome directory and the registry. I imagine a similar tactic will defeat this measure. At least before the removal of the third party installation route, Chrome was able to control the messaging and generate warnings. These changes are simply pushing the malevolent even further underground.",1383865181

Paying $7 for measuring myself againt some arbitrary concentration level is a joke. And also that function times out for me.<p>But the main question, why does this help me to do deliberate practice? I don&#x27;t see any feature you have that would help:<p>- a list to remember for myself what areas to practice, schedule that and did I do that? but that is nothing more than a todo list<p>- I think the feedback concept is wrong. I understand you want to capture that somehow, but eg. for a tennis player or musician, in a session there are feedback every second, what you observe an correct in the minute. It&#x27;s not a 1-5 scale for the whole session and not something you measure this way.<p>- go to calnewport.com , he has some good stuff on this<p>In my opinion the biggest problem with deliberate practice is to find out what to practice and with what framework.

If MS are able to update .NET, DirectX and all their other libraries and maintain backwards compatibility then I&#x27;m sure they could with IE as well. There&#x27;s no real technical reason hampering them, just a lack of incentive and plenty of excuses.<p>And the ROI point is moot because it&#x27;s already been pointed out that all of the other big browsers still support XP.<p>Every 3 years its the same bullshit, MS release a new version of Windows and suddenly all their new software cannot run on their older versions of Windows - as if this new OS magically changes the way how Trident works. As someone who&#x27;s hacked his way around some of Windows internals, I don&#x27;t buy MSs marketing, it&#x27;s just a ploy to sell more copies of their latest OS.",1383864431

Looking for work<p>Your resume should be 2 pages, tops. If Guido van Rossum can have a short resume [1] so can you.<p>There is an important skill here and that&#x27;s learning how to reduce what you&#x27;re saying to the most salient points. This applies to resumes and presentations. This ties in to the oft-quoted Blaise Pascal [2]. As soon as you start writing &quot;Responsible for design and development&quot; you&#x27;ve gone astray.<p>The key things that should be in your resume shouldn&#x27;t be your responsibilities (nobody cares) but what you&#x27;ve actually done.<p>You may think all 10 pages are important but they&#x27;re not. The person reading it might have a stack of 50 on their desk. Each is probably only going to get 30 seconds of attention (tops) before a large number are culled and a second pass is made.<p>Some seem to argue that this is the hiring manager&#x27;s problem and they should have longer attention spans. But the fact is if you can&#x27;t get your point across quickly there value of extra time spent on a resume diminishes quickly.<p>Now this all changes in certain job situations, for example contracting with large companies. At such places your resume will go through a filter before it ever sees a hiring manager. That filter is of course the HR department. HR departments, as a general rule, don&#x27;t have a clue about technology. All they do is look at the job description and look for the appropriate acronyms in your resume.<p>I once got asked &quot;I see you have 5 years of Java experience, but do you have any J2SE experience?&quot; End result? My resume was updated to say &quot;Java/J2SE - 7 years&quot;.<p>You have to balance this out. Getting past HR just to appear like buzzword nonsense to a hiring manager is winning the battle to lose the war. So there still has to be enough meat.<p>Another way of culling information is highlighting what&#x27;s relevant to that position and de-emphasizing (or removing entirely) the irrelevant. If you&#x27;re applying for a job doing Linux driver development in C and you did 3 years of J2EE 8 years ago, nobody is going to care. Just delete it (for that job). If that creates a gap, reduce that experience to <i>one line</i>.<p>Tailoring resumes for specific jobs is one skill or idea that many people don&#x27;t seem to have in my experience. It&#x27;s OK to have multiple versions of your resume as long as they don&#x27;t contradict each other.<p>2. Visa/immigration issues<p>Different kettle of fish. Here it&#x27;s a bit like the HR filter case. Immigration officials will look at the job description and look for that experience on your resume. You need to make it simple for them. That can include putting key terms and acronyms in bold (seriously).<p>3. Freelancing<p>Probably most relevant is what project you&#x27;ve successfully completed and any references of such you have. Your employment responsibilities become less relevant. So have a line &quot;Worked 3 years for IBM&quot; if you must but no real need to break it down beyond job title.<p>Links to your work are far more important in this case.<p>4. Applying for (typically government) contracts.<p>The HR case on steroids. Government contracts are seemingly decided on the raw weight of supporting documentation. Put in every little detail you can. Or you could do something useful with your life.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.python.org/~guido/Resume.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/~guido/Resume.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal#Sourced"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal#Sourced</a>",1383863906

The major advancements in living standards and job creation have largely been due to technological improvements, free market capitalism, enterprises and entrepreneurs. The largest redistributions of wealth have been due to voluntary membership in trade unions and individuals exercising their right to choose employer. Governments and nation states have historically opposed any change to things like guild systems and even ordered military forces to break up strike actions.

In that way I am just a different kind of authoritarian than you. There may even be a high practical value for a central government to administer things like infrastructure, defence and judical system.<p>But once we get past that point we are walking a slippery sloap and we must be very careful with every step we take - otherwise we might end up in a situation where it is me or your who gets a thoroughly examaniation of our back part like the gentleman mentioned in the article above.<p>And I really don&#x27;t see how that is covered in any form of social contract.",1383863851

In physics, such simple terms go a long long way, and to this day I still fall back on very simple ideas to understand sophisticated systems (e.g., &quot;Well, there is positive charge here, so negative charge would want to get close to it&quot;, etc.). Many papers and many people make things seem far more complicated than they are. Personally, I am a huge fan of using colloquial language in describing things, as I think it makes things far easier to parse and get something out of it that you feel comfortable with.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of success in my teaching, too, largely because of my effort to keep things colloquial and down-to-earth. Too many teachers fall into the trap of not falling back on things students are comfortable with when students are not understanding the material (or, hell, maybe the teachers aren&#x27;t particularly comfortable with the subject matter). A huge part of my success as a teacher is exactly that I try to see where the students&#x27; train of logic gets derailed and take a step back in how abstract the explanation is there while also providing ample motivation for that sort of thinking.<p>Lastly, I wanted to recommend a great resource for learning specifically physics from a guy that is fantastic at explaining things in simple terms: Walter Lewin. Walter Lewin is a professor at MIT, and has incredible video-recorded lectures on electricity and magnetism (the class is 8.02). if you have an ounce of interest, go watch some --- you won&#x27;t regret it.",1383863520

I work at a small company that has a cute tool. This software is for predicting hardware reliability. You take your ECAD board files (ODB++, Gerber etc) and create a model for the board assembly in about 15 minutes and 15 minutes after that you have reliability predictions for solder fatigue due to thermal cycling or vibration. Plated through hole fatigue is also calculated as well as the reliability due to shock events. There is a module for ICT(in circuit testing) for calculating the reliability during manufacturing.
It does quite a few other things and we have some awesome software and hardware customers. Our customers really do make my day some times. I call   our users directly once in a while and today I heard this from a brand new user &quot;You know how you sometimes get a light bulb moment? This is like a room full of light bulbs.&quot;

In Android sideloading is disabled by default, and if a user knows what he&#x27;s doing, he&#x27;ll enable it and do whatever he wants.<p>So why can&#x27;t Google do the same with Chrome?! Disable sideloading by default, but still keep the option in settings somewhere. What&#x27;s the big deal? Unless they have a completely different agenda behind this...<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure, but do Chrome extensions work in Opera or Safari?

My story for why I created Syrio:<p>As a high school student, I share similar vices with other students, mainly intense procrastination (Facebook/Reddit/HN). I would always want to improve my programming skills, but right before I would start, my browser would find itself on some time-wasting site. Stuff like StayFocusd never worked - instead of going to Facebook, I would start doodling.<p>I tried other anti-procrastinating apps, but they never seemed to focus on the right thing. I was having trouble finding the motivation to extend my abilities. Learning a new programming technique amounted to a study of inefficiency. I would constantly put it off, because learning new things is hard and scary. Other apps focused more on mundane issues (i.e. throw out the trash), but I needed help with deliberately practicing.<p>If you don&#x27;t know, deliberate practice is intensely focusing on skills that are beyond your current skillset. Popularized by Malcolm Gladwell (author of Outliers), deliberate practice is required in order to become an expert in your field. Just regular practice won&#x27;t cut it -- you need to be constantly expanding your skillset.
Frustrated by the lack of tools helping with this, I figured I could try and create an app myself. I started learning the necessary technologies to create the app (the learning was unfortunately impaired by procrastination). I finished the initial prototype, and then started using.<p>I found that it was pretty dang effective (of course, take this with a grain of salt -- after all, the app is my creation). By tracking and charting my progress over time, I found myself deliberately practicing more and more. Not only was I improving my skills, but I was also feeling more content with myself. Before using Syrio, I was somewhat hated myself due to all the procrastination, but now, I don&#x27;t have to beat myself over wasted time.<p>Obviously, Syrio is far from perfect, and so I would love for some of you guys and gals to try it out. I want to improve the product so it works for a large majority of people. If you have feedback, please PM me or send an email to syrioapp AT gmail.com<p>Thanks for your time.",1383863098

I have yet to find one that does a great job aggregating several accounts in a seamless way. It requires my webserver to be able to see the folder where I store my mail, which is a big concern (or alternately it requires me to run an intranet-only webserver for the explicit purpose of providing webmail, at which point why not just run a desktop client?).

My resume for those positions was a grueling 10 pager.<p>I keep my resume up to date every couple months, and about once a year go through an overhaul it. In my last overhaul, I got it down to 2 solid pages, which isn&#x27;t bad for handling almost 20 years of work, a bunch of schooling and some other sundry. I have a couple different versions of the resume as well, depending on what I&#x27;m shooting for but generally I follow this.<p>My last couple jobs I try and include quite a few broad level bullets, especially if the job had lots of variety in it. Editing (cutting out things) is really hard, but nobody wants to read a novel. After that I start to reduce the amount of space I&#x27;m willing to consume for a position.<p>Very old positions are pretty much year:title:company and that&#x27;s it.<p>Education is also pretty direct, year, degree, school with GPA in the margin. Nobody really wants to read about all the extra curricular activities, especially if you went to school a long time ago.<p>Way down at the end of my second page, I stuck some misc: tools, awards, publications that sort of thing. People aren&#x27;t generally super interested in those things in my field, but it pads out the second page. Just work + Education gives me a decently breeze 1.5 pager.<p>But editing some of that stuff out was <i>really</i> hard. There&#x27;s work that I&#x27;ve done years ago that I&#x27;m really proud of, but it&#x27;s just not worth it to have on there anymore eating up lots of space.<p>Having been a hiring manager, I really care about what you worked on in your last job, why you want this job and if a quick breeze over your work history shows a forward moving progression of increasing responsibility.<p>I remember reading through some really dreadful 9-13 page resumes during the .com boom where people 2 or 3 years out of high school were listing extensive tables of dozens of very expensive technologies like expert level SGI IRIX.<p>The consistently worst resumes tend to come from people outside the U.S. So I try to cut them slack, but sometimes you get resumes where you can tell they&#x27;re just throwing buzz words against the wall to see if it gets them a job and they have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>I worked with another hiring manager who followed a strict policy of tossing any resume with a single spelling or grammar error. It sounds harsh, but her idea was that anybody who couldn&#x27;t take care enough on their resume wouldn&#x27;t take care enough of their work. Her company has been wildly successful so there might be something there.",1383861821

> From the website:<p>Most of this is marketing talk without any specific examples or comparisons. The project manager for Codehaus Groovy is a non-technical SpringSource employee who frequently makes bold statements about Groovy without giving any evidence.<p>> - builds upon the strengths of Java but has additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk<p>Groovy is really just a clone of Ruby but with Java-like syntax. It&#x27;s business purpose was solely to be an appendage to Grails, so Grails could take some market-share away from Rails. &quot;Ruby on Rails&quot;, &quot;Groovy on Grails&quot;, get it?<p>Grails itself started as a thin wrapper around other software products from various companies (e.g. Spring from SpringSource, Hibernate from JBoss) so Grails dictator Graeme Rocher could use it to muscle in on the training and consultancy markets for those products. He then started a company, G2One Inc, and quickly shopped it around among the various companies whose products he bundled, successfully fooling SpringSource into buying it 12 mths afterwards.<p>Always look thru the marketing talk to the business purpose of something when deciding whether to adopt. You&#x27;ll get burnt otherwise.<p>> It has also recently entered the top 20 on Tiobe Index and it&#x27;s the only one amongst other well-known JVM languages ( Scala (#36), JavaFX Script (#41) and Clojure (#76)) [2]<p>6 months ago Groovy wasn&#x27;t even in their Top 50. I doubt Groovy suddenly became popular in a mere 6 months. Groovy&#x27;s sudden high ranking says more about how dubious Tiobe&#x27;s algorithms are than about Groovy&#x27;s uptake by developers.<p>In fact, Tiobe have been frequently changing their algorithms over the last 6 months so maybe there&#x27;s been some interference. 3 years ago (Dec 2010) Groovy Tech Lead Jochen Theodorou volunteered his services to Tiobe to polish their algorithms. Groovy then shot up from below 50 to number 25. In April 2011, however, Groovy dropped from 25 to number 65 in a single month when Tiobe added more search engines. Hope Groovy&#x27;s not similarly embarrassed again because of the short-sightedness of it&#x27;s non-technical promoters.",1383861768

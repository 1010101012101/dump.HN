Shirts were about $100-300 each, pants $100-200, shoes another $100. (I had a very friendly expense account at the time.)<p>This was south California casual, I guess? Shoes that look good sockless (or wear those little liner socks). Button-down shirts that have some simple design.

If you look at the signatures of those traits, you&#x27;ll see that Fn&#x27;s method takes self by reference, FnMut takes it by mutable reference, and FnOnce takes it by value. In particular, this means that the body of an FnOnce closure can <i>move values out</i> from the closure (that&#x27;s why it can only be called once), whereas Fn and FnMut can only access values in the closure by reference and mutable reference, respectively.<p>The way variables are <i>captured</i> from the environment into the closure is controlled by the &quot;move&quot; keyword. If the &quot;move&quot; keyword precedes a closure expression, then variables from the environment are moved into the closure, which takes ownership of them. &quot;move&quot; is usually associated with FnOnce closures, but it&#x27;s also needed when returning a boxed Fn or FnMut closure from a function, as you can see below:<p><pre><code>    fn make_appender(x: String) -> Box<Fn(&str) -> String + &#x27;static> {
        Box::new(move |y|
            // The closure has & access to its captured variable, but
            // it has been moved into the closure so it outlives the
            // body of make_appender, thanks to the move
            // keyword.
            x.clone() + y

And you will get a lot of reinforcement of that belief from a variety of sources. That said, the belief doesn&#x27;t preclude non-wealthy people from getting away with passing whatever crap they want, it just says &quot;People who engage with Congress, (usually) get away with passing what ever crap they want.&quot;<p>If you are wondering how to &quot;engage with Congress&quot; the easy way is during election season but you can also visit them in Washington or at their office in your district. While some districts are quite gerrymandered by their nature the local office is often within driving distance. They also host fund raisers and that while there are some expensive ones, there are also cheap ones (like $25 or $50 a &quot;plate&quot;) since every dollar counts in a war chest. You can meet their staff at these (often quite accessible) and if you&#x27;re at all reasonable develop something of a &quot;relationship&quot; with your elected representative. And even if you dislike their point of view until the next go-round they are your representative.<p>If you talk with other donors at the event you may find other donors who share your point of view on a particular issue and with some persuasion you may be able to develop a coalition of donors who think like you do, bringing even more attention to your issues.<p>Politics is people, and it is <i>always</i> local.

I&#x27;ve probably been guilty of this myself, in the past.<p>it&#x27;s definitely possible to write very satisfying and effective music-generating code, but there is almost never an incredibly deep lesson to learn about the nature of consciousness there. there <i>ARE</i> very, very often incredibly deep and specific lessons to learn about the inner workings of particular musical forms.<p>I wrote a drum-and-bass drum pattern generator which made me much, much better at writing drum patterns by hand afterwards. one of the professors I studied with (briefly) wrote an amazing fuzzy logic counterpoint generator which allowed him to, effectively, improvise entire concertos, and I&#x27;m reasonably confident he learned an enormous amount about classical counterpoint in the process.<p>(note that &quot;improvise entire concertos&quot; means &quot;play a MIDI wind controller, improvise a tune, and have his software generate appropriate harmonic accompaniment.&quot; the overhyping tendency bit me even as I was warning you about it.)<p>likewise, I think the author of this nautil.us post learned an enormous amount about what makes ambient music work well. and probably got much better at working in Max/MSP.<p>but this is not Skynet shit. this is not proof of the rise of machine consciousness. this is intricately technical work which develops your skill in programming and musical composition.<p>that&#x27;s really all there is to it.",1423865114

The habits of people here regarding food waste is significant, too - I have a friend who will go to Taco John late at night, get six tacos, three potato things, 10 packets of sauce, eat two tacos and a potato thing and leave the rest to waste in his kitchen counter. He sees it as $5, but the costs to society may be more than that. Or my girlfriend&#x27;s kids, who will fidget and fight about eating a burrito until we throw away half of it. Based on my vague observations, at least half the food produced gets tossed out for some reason (and not even composted!).<p>For instance, significant resources went into creating meat like this 30-40 lbs I saw wasted in a dumpster outside a restaurant in Denver : <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ns4TunE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ns4TunE.jpg</a> Beef is one of the most water intensive food products, too.",1423864999

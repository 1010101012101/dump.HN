9874715,comment,9874215,9874215,0,0,anastasds,,,"All of this is poorly defined (edit: I meant mathematically not well defined) as a game theory problem, from the premises to the suggestion that it&#x27;s &quot;the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma with extra credit&quot;.<p>First, the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is defined for two people, which this is not. Furthermore, the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma assumes perfectly rational actors; we cannot assume that of students.<p>Second (and related to the number of players), the 10% metric has different meanings based on the number of players (students). With two people, one person opting for six points constitutes 50%, which might be the case for an advanced elective at a small school. A first year biology class at a major university might have hundreds of students, in which case we can treat the 10% condition as stated.<p>Third, the outcomes of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma are either absolute gain or absolute loss - either jail or freedom. In this case, no possible outcome constitutes loss relative to the starting state; a player can fail to gain, but cannot be worse from where he or she started before playing. A premise that would make this closer to the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma would be that if more than some percentage of the students opt for the six points, then all students lose six points.<p>Overall, this seems like something this instructor is doing for fun rather than as an experiment in a formal extension of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma.<p>For my part, I&#x27;d opt for the 2, based on what I remember about undergraduate students. I have no formal reasoning to support this, however.<p>tl;dr As stated, this is neither an extension of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, nor is it well-defined in any case. It seems to me that any suggested solution will require either additional data or additional assumptions. Either way, I&#x27;d choose 2 points, and I would be interested to see the outcome of this instructor&#x27;s survey.",1436731181

It&#x27;s not clear how these 8 questions do a very good job of measuring attitude extremity along the economic axis.<p>Questions along the other axis also seem too nuanced for a simple 1-5 answer (agree-strongly to disagree-strongly).  For example are nuclear power stations &quot;extremely dangerous&quot; to the environment.  Well, in my mind, of course they pose some danger, but less so than the coal plants they often replace. I&#x27;d have to disagree strongly that they are &quot;extremely&quot; dangerous (i.e. be classified as having an extreme attitude). I&#x27;m not trying to start an argument over the pros and cons of nuclear power here, but just wanted to point out that the questions selected by the researchers introduce their own bias where shallower answers seem more centrist.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m too sensitive about these kinds of classifications.

On that basis, my advice would be as follows:<p>1. Decide whether you want to become a co-founder of the company. They key thing is whether you want to join that team and work with those individuals.<p>2. Don&#x27;t expect to receive a large dollar amount. It&#x27;s not an exit - it&#x27;s an acquihire. You want to find out how much the co-founders are getting paid and use that as a benchmark for your salary.<p>3. <i>Do</i> make sure that you do full due diligence - you need to see the cap table and understand what terms all the existing shareholder (including the founders - e.g. vesting schedules) and investors (e.g. any preferential terms) have. I&#x27;d be wary if they were reluctant to share any of that information. It&#x27;s not unreasonable for them to ask that you sign an NDA. Get a lawyer to review any document they want you to sign and talk you through what it means. In fact, it&#x27;s not a bad idea to get your own NDA drafted up and put it forward to them.<p>4. Be clear on what your role will be going forward. You don&#x27;t want any hand-waving or &quot;We&#x27;ll sort that out later.&quot;<p>5. Ensure that everyone&#x27;s expectations (including both yours and the other company&#x27;s investors&#x27;) are clear and aligned. Don&#x27;t make any assumptions. Lay everything out in painstakingly explicitness.<p>6. Make sure that you&#x27;re protected in case things don&#x27;t work out. Basically, think about what could go wrong. Will your equity be subject to vesting? What happens if they fire you before the vesting period is complete?<p>If you want to go into specifics, I&#x27;d be happy to talk further on a confidential basis.

Before that, there were\nstill isolated research and development centers in most countries that\nused their own languages, and even sometimes developped national\nprogramming language (I know of French, Russian, Chinese programming\nlanguages).<p>But one could consider that nowadays there is a big enough national\nprogrammer community that we could stand a little bit more of\nisolation, and therefore use national languages.<p>In a way, Japan, Korean and China do that.  They definitely have\n&quot;enough&quot; programmers, and their language is hardly readable outside of\ntheir countries.  There&#x27;s probably a lot of very interesting\neg. robotics papers and programs available from Japan, but since I\ndon&#x27;t speak Japanese, I&#x27;ll never know.<p>On the other hand, computing and notably programming is still very\ndivided; there are thousands of programming languages, and apart from\nthe most &quot;popular&quot; the vast majority of them only have a small\npopulation of programmers working with them.  Therefore you still\ndefinitely want to benefit from any network-effect you can have thru\nthe Internet, and for this reason, you will use almost exclusively\nEnglish to publish documentation and sources in those programming\nlanguages.<p>Using a national language would work only for more popular language.\nBut it would have to fight the influence of the language providers.\nIn the privative world, it&#x27;s the operating system and GUI framework\nproviders who decide what programming language to use, and while it&#x27;s\ngenerally possible to use a different language, it&#x27;s often rather\ncostly and difficult to do so.  So Apple (actually NeXT Computer Inc)\ndecided on Objective-C, and now Apple is deciding to switch to Swift.\nAndroid decided on Java.  Microsoft decided on C++ (and C# and Visual\nBasic, but mostly C++ with MSVC).  But in terms of national security\nand national independence it would be a bad idea to use those american\noperating system that contain a lot of privative software.  So you\ncould use GNU/Linux as a base (but Richard Stallman is American and\naimed to clone an American operating system (unix) so of course he\nused English and C to write GNU, and for the network effect, Linus\nwanted to get help from more than just the Finish programmers, so he\nused English and C to write the Linux kernel), and over this free\nbase, you could develop your own national programming language, with\nyour own system utilities and non-localized applications.  Since this\nwould be a major enterprise (companies doing that such as Apple,\nMicrosoft of Google, are &quot;worth&quot; more than most countries), you would\nneed a strong public support, this would give work to a lot of\nnational programmers (and you couldn&#x27;t use alien programmers, no H1B,\nsince they just wouldn&#x27;t know the language to read the specifications\nand documentation or the programming language to write the programs).<p>Clearly, this is a project that is antithetic to the internationalist\ncapitalist point of view.  A corporation wouldn&#x27;t invest in such a\nproject, because it would have to pay national programmers a higher\nsalary than hiring cheap immigrants, or off-shoring development to\nthird world countries.  And they wouldn&#x27;t want to use a language and\nprogramming languages that would restrict their &quot;IPOability&quot; to\ninternational capitalist corporations (that can pay in worthless US\ndollars).<p>Remains that children don&#x27;t necessarily know English, therefore there\nis still place for some programming to be done in a national language\n(to teach programming to children and otherwise non-English speakers),\nand even for a national programming language, to be used in a\npedagogical context.  But if your nation is enslaved in the capitalist\nsystem where people have to be employed by corporations and obtain\nmoney to survive, then eventually they will have to learn a popular\nEnglish programming language and work for a corporations that\npotentially will be eaten alive by an international capitalist\ncorporation from the USA (see eg. Microsoft with Nokia, after having\ngutted and digested all it could from it, patents, human &quot;resources&quot;,\nintellectual &quot;property&quot;, they&#x27;re ready to resell the empty\nshell. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2014/07/18/to-help-boost-growth-should-microsoft-sell-nokia-to-lenovo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2014/07/18/to-help-bo...</a>\nAnd this is not unique, it occurs constantly.  I&#x27;d argue that if Nokia\nhad been more 100% Finish, it would have been much more costly for\nMicrosoft to acquire it and to exploit it, and possibly Nokia would\nhave been stayed Finish and these people would have still be able to\ndevelop those nice Nokia smartphones).",1436729974

Initially I would finish 3 hour programming assignments in 10-15 minutes and was the student representative of the CS department. I had a lot of friends, and was quite &#x27;normal&#x27; I suppose. Then things started literally falling apart. I lost interest in my old hobbies, stopped talking to friends, kept failing classes, found no pleasure in anything. I asked my roommates to find another place and started living alone, and then decided to commit suicide by cutting my wrists in the bathtub with a knife but pussied out when the blade touched my skin... Fuck, what a nightmare.<p>However, I somehow dragged my feet through this misery and managed to graduate (two years late and at the bottom of my class) and luckily bumped into an old friend who remembered how good I was with computers back in highschool. He was running his own company and offered me a (non-programming, IT) job. It was great at first but once again the depression started rearing its ugly head and I started slacking off at work, being late for appointments and isolating myself again.<p>I tried doing the things people seem to suggest online like exercising regularly (never could for more than a month), yoga, mindful meditation, but I would always relapse.<p>It took me 6-months to finally get the courage and see a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and put me on lexapro. I could never imagine how much 10mg of something could change your life.<p>Within a few days I started seeing major changes in myself. It rekindled my interests in my hobbies (programming, gaming, reading etc.) my memory improved tremendously, I felt compassion towards my friends and family, much more social and became super efficient at work. Fast forward a year and I&#x27;m now CEO of my friends company and I&#x27;ve dealt with some personal tragedies on the way without relapsing. Things are holding up pretty well.<p>If you think you&#x27;re depressed don&#x27;t hesitate to seek help.

I&#x27;ve read many accounts of Amazon launching their own version of a product and sometimes going as far as suspending or ejecting the seller or sellers with the product that inspired them.<p>My guess is that there are too many sellers making money on Amazon who take the abuse.  To speak up would mean to risk losing your business.  So people don&#x27;t.  I see one massive class action lawsuit in the making.<p>The other Amazon scam has to do with sales tax.  Rather than collecting sales tax on every sale they&#x27;ve somehow managed to pass this on to third party sellers.  It&#x27;s as if Walmart had their suppliers become responsible for collecting and paying sales tax at every Walmart location.  Which makes no sense.<p>Amazon should collect and pay sales taxes in every state where they have a warehouse.  States are getting cheated out of tax revenue because Amazon plays lose with this and sellers have no clue they are tasked with collecting taxes.  A secondary effect is that sellers get into massive trouble with authorities because Amazon doesn&#x27;t collect taxes for them and does not submit the funds to the sellers.  When sellers discover they were made responsible for sales tax they often end-up with a huge bill that nearly ruins them.",1436728185

Unsurprising that this is also your first post. Goodbye, troll.&quot;<p>That is not a &quot;troll&quot; statement, nor a &quot;psychopath&quot; statement. I say the exact same thing to my own self, and it is very important for me to say to my own self.<p>That does not mean saying it to a stranger on a public forum is necessarily likely to help them come to better understanding. It can depend on who they are, and how they operate.<p>But, what you did there is an excellent example for a very serious flaw in &#x27;how people think of others&#x27;. Taking a completely valid yet &quot;critical&quot; statement and dismissing the person making it (even if it were your own self) does what? It is <i></i>depersonalizing<i></i> the person.<p>You do not have to think about what they have to say, because you have closed off thinking by labeling them. In this case, your diagnosis is both as a &quot;troll&quot; (derogatory, listen to nothing they say)... and a &quot;psychopath&quot; (derogatory, listen to nothing they say).<p><i>You</i> may not listen to this, but perhaps others would. And maybe, even some part of you could. This is not abnormal reaction, it is a normal, common reaction. People want to shut down sources that have anything challenging to say.<p>Truth is, my statement actually implies something positive about you. That you have done effective and strong research in your own area, which I am taking from your nick to be &quot;security&quot;. As in computer security. With some consideration for the <i>context</i>, which is this forum.<p>So, someone says one good thing and one &quot;bad&quot; thing, and that causes an immediate - automatic - reaction to shut them down consciously... and depersonalize them with not just one emotionally laden label, but two.<p>That, btw, is how the unconscious interacts with the conscious. Automatic behavior. There are other ways, but you have to deprogram yourself, or better - debug yourself - in order to get closer access to your unconscious and make more informed judgments.<p>I may have been manipulative for another reason. I may have been pattern breaking, or trying to shut down your conscious facilities to get everything else in there. Benign, malicious... your conscious would have one view, your &quot;unconscious&quot; another.<p>FYI, I will be completely upfront: I am dual studied in these fields, but within very narrow scopes. And the reason why - besides general personal betterment - well, for psychology, it was to deal with <i>madness</i>. Not &quot;sociopathy&quot;, not &quot;psychopathy&quot;.<p>PTSD, paranoid schizophrenia, schizoaffective... are some of the meaningful labels there. Addictive Personality disorder. At times, depression, and other possible labels could be applied to myself by myself, or by professional psychiatrists. But, those are just labels. And while they have some value for my own self to help me find potential &quot;cures&quot;, they are not names. They are not permanent labels. When you get into that kind of thinking, you are setting your own course for <i>no change</i>. It is destructive.<p>Conversely, I understand what I am prone to, and that can help me know how to steer the boat of my own self in the future.<p>A lot of the best advice I have ever gotten was challenging. Advice which has no challenge often is just &#x27;what people want to hear&#x27;.<p>It is true, typically, what one wants to do to persuade someone is to be indirect and build up rapport. But, if it is always rapport, you end up doing nothing to lead them anywhere else. You might as well just be a monkey or parrot.<p>Even if, where you actually need to go is the wrong place you are being led to... it still is very likely... a place you have not even considered before. And so, then, you have another possible &quot;here be sea monsters&quot; or big rocks and low ground you can put on your map. And go somewhere else.<p>&quot;Sure non-criminal, adults forgo emotions on the job after essentially being trained to do so. Probably learned it over time with other life experiences requiring the same thing. Yet, how did the younger one&#x27;s learn to have no empathy or feelings? What exact path leads to other people&#x27;s suffering exciting them or causing sexual arousal? What individual experience lead people to compulsively commit harm or deception against their own intentions?&quot;<p>Asking the &quot;how&#x27;s&quot; is very difficult, without extensively studying &quot;such people&quot;. But, when you do study them, you discover while there may be commonalities, there is also individuality.<p>Freud/Fraud worked hard at pretending to study root causes, but the guy was just popularizing and bastardizing concepts which were already there. His own four or so patients he had, every single one was a failure.<p>You mention &#x27;sexual sadism&#x27; in the same vein as really very common other &quot;symptoms&quot; or &quot;indicators&quot;. But, &#x27;sexual sadism&#x27; is extremely rare, very aberrant, very bizarre.<p>My point is: why do you need to understand psychology. This is important. Because people get good at what they <i>need</i> to do. And they constantly give themselves other reasons for other matters.<p>So, many in psychology just needed a job. Many needed to fix or maintain themselves. Often people just need some further understanding which they can then use to displace and put away matters they do not want to deliberate on, to think on.<p>In security, you may want to control some people. You definitely want to predict their behavior. But, normally, you are more interested in &quot;economic&quot; level factors, in terms of risk analysis.<p>Individual analysis is not much needed for most areas of comp sec. I have had to apply it, because I have worked with sources. Or perform security interviews. But, that is personal, individualistic.<p>Usually, I just have to consider wider range factors that involve such matters on a more economic level. Where economy may mean, directly, money. Or it may be economy of information. What is the value of what you are protecting by considering the value of it in various markets. That sort of thing.<p>And, FYI, I posted here, on this, first, because the psychological implications of security interest me the most. This is a specific area where I have seen those who are most at fault, are those who are the ones attempting to do the labelling. So, it intrigues me to see their ideas, their perspectives.",1436727726

515633,comment,515626,515626,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"Yeah, yeah. I hear ya.<p>Talked to a friend of mine who worked for Microsoft few years back and the ""4 testers per 1 developer"" was all the rage. Code now, ship tomorrow, design next month. Obviously one of the tradeoffs. It worked wonders for the business, but engineering-wise the output is an utter crap. I spent few years writing kernel-level stuff for Windows <i>and</i> Linux, and the difference in quality is absolutely staggering.",1237006674

515629,comment,515357,515441,0,0,briansmith,,,"> Every new release getting better, faster, more usable; growing market-share faster all the time...<p>You could be describing Windows or Mac OS X with that.<p>>  What goes up must, must come down, at some point.<p>That rule doesn't really apply to software. The main thing problem in producing an operating system is coming up with a significant improvement over the previous release. For example, Windows XP was and is still good enough for almost everybody. Vista makes a lot of things easier and simpler, but for many people that isn't a compelling reason to upgrade. I'm sure Mac OS X has the same problem; except for programmers, I've never met a Mac OS X user that has upgraded Mac OS X.",1237006196

Similar to the way a writer can appreciate a particularly beautiful phrase, a programmer can enjoy a clever solution to a given problem. I, and many others, enjoy the art of finding these ""beautiful"" solutions.",1237005528

515619,comment,515234,515482,0,0,hboon,,,"If it's a web app, and you don't need/want the app store distribution, then you probably want to build it as a web app and market it as such. The app store itself is not much of a marketing tool unless you are already very popular.<p>But then if it has no app store presence, how would you charge the user? I might build a few more features around the web service approach to take advantage of the rapid deployment benefit you mention, but probably not as a full blown web app. I don't know of any app doing the latter, but I'm not surprised if there is.",1237004157

515615,comment,512801,514457,0,0,jrockway,,,"Sure, you <i>can</i> store it in a relational database, but you have to map your data to some structure that it doesn't have.  That's what we call a hack.<p>If you use an object database, you can store your data exactly as it is represented in memory.  That is much cleaner, IMO.<p>(Relational databases are like programming languages.  Just like you can use any programming language for any task, and you can hack any data you want into the relational model.  But that's not always the best way.  Sometimes a key/value store, or an object store, or a document store is a better model.  Using a better model means you need to write less code, which means your app will have fewer bugs.)",1237003231

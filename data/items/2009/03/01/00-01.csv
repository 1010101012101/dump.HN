I spent about 3 years living in Canlen Walk (Near the intersection of 85 & Buford Hwy), 4 years on the Georgia Tech campus.  What ethnicity are you?<p>I can count many times walking from shops near the Varsity around North Ave when I encounter African Americans, they always ching-chong me thinking I'm from out of the country.  I'm like dude, I've lived in America for as long as you have.",1235868883

498643,comment,497869,497869,0,0,modoc,,,"Congrats on the launch and good press!  I wish you the best of luck.  There is probably a decent number of people who would like to avoid dealing with the database infrastructure directly.<p>However, this launch raises a question for me, with regards to funding and YCombinator.<p>Obviously I'm only seeing what's in the video, but it looks like you have a provisioning system, and a web interface (like an enhanced phpMyAdmin).  I assume there's backups, failover, monitoring, etc... in the background as well.<p>Why did you need funding for this?  What did you gain from YCombinator?  Perhaps I'm downplaying your efforts due to ignorance on how your system really works, but it seems pretty straightforward to build.  I don't use EC2, but I'm pretty sure I could build a web app that creates new databases, an enhanced version of phpMyAdmin, and my standard monitoring/backup stuff that I do already, in a couple of days.  My understanding is the ""cloud"" aspect of EC2 makes scaling the new db instances out much easier (than if I did it myself using dedicated servers).  So I'm not sure why you felt you needed investors, months of dedicated full time work, exposure to VCs, etc...?<p>My intent isn't to be snarky or put down your accomplishments, but clearly I'm missing either the complexity and effort to build your solution, or I'm missing some key ingredient that YC provided that made your startup easier/possible/etc...",1235868367
498642,comment,498431,498543,0,0,catch23,,,"Erm, I guess you have a higher threshold for tolerance.  Every time I board Marta, I'm usually mocked by someone of African American decent there.  And almost every time I have to explain that I grew up here, I'm as American as you, yada yada.  And these Marta stations are pretty close to downtown (Midtown, Peachtree, Lindbergh station, etc)  Diverse?  Partially.  Tolerant?  No.<p>Diversity is nothing compared to SF.  Atlanta has whites, blacks, and latinos.  You won't find a significant percentage of another.  Even on Buford Highway where the majority of Asian grocery stores are, you'll find that Latinos outnumber the Asian population 2:1.  California has a good mix of everyone, it's the reason I love it here.",1235868307

While it worked great locally, trying to point a cluster at the DB in the backup data center (50 ms away on a dedicated backbone line) absolutely killed performance.<p>Also, for another eCommerce site, the local dev instance on my laptop boots in about ~ 1 minute when running against a local database.

Honestly, I did not like the startup scene there, I moved out and now live in the Bay Area.  I'm an Asian American and there really is no diversity unless you live on Buford Hwy... at least nothing compared to living in SF/Bay Area.  You don't notice the racism there until you move out.  People here in the bay area don't really care where you're from or what's your background.  It's incredibly refreshing!<p>If you're white, you probably don't notice the racism.  If you're not white, I'm sure you'd notice it.  The African American population in Atlanta often think that all Asians living there came from oversees.",1235867858

498630,comment,498431,498431,0,0,jhaynie,,,"I probably shouldn't even delve into commenting on a stream that has turned a positive blog  article into ""atlanta is racist"".  strange.<p>I grew up in Atlanta but have lived in Chicago, Washington state, Florida and Tokyo, Japan.  I now live in Mountain View, California in the heart of the valley.<p>Atlanta is a great place to live, raise a family and has its own unique tech/geek/startup culture.  It's hard to compare the valley to Atlanta - but that's true with any other location on the planet.  Silicon Valley is unique and difficult to replicate.<p>These types of ""centers"" happen because of aggregation of people and resources.  Nashville has an aggregation that supports country music, Atlanta has hip-hop, LA has Hollywood, D.C. has politics and NYC still is the financial capital of the world.  Silicon Valley is just the technology capital of the world.  With any rule, you have exceptions - plenty of great technology companies come out of Vancouver, Seattle, Portland and Denver (just to name a few).<p>What Atlanta and all other places should focus on isn't how to replicate the valley - but instead, how to create their own unique place which highlights and rewards their own achievements and strengths. It will take a lot of constituents to make that happen - entrepreneurs, investors, law makers and educators.<p>One stark contrast that might be worth exploring is the difference between the Valley and other locations is reinvestment through the social contract.  In the Valley, there is a very strong sense of a social contract from entrepreneurs to entrepreneurs (and investors to entrepreneurs).  I feel a much stronger sense of success which breeds more success (or help, resources, guidance and mentorship).  In fact, anecdotally, it seems like way more entrepreneurs ""who make it big"" in the valley, attempt to repeat - either directly in their own subsequent startups or minimally through very active advising and investment in younger upstarts.  I would contrast that to Atlanta where I believe that's more of the exception than the norm.  (Plenty of people have such as John Imlay, Mitch Free, Alan Graber, Tom Noonon, just to name a few).  My own personal assessment is that it might be because there are (a) fewer very large exits in Atlanta, (b) it's easier to retire with less money in Atlanta and (c) there's no peer pressure to do it again.<p>Recently, however, I'm very encouraged by all of the entrepreneurs that have decided to take things into their own hands.  Atlanta knows who they are (Lance Weatherby, Scott Burkett, Sanjay Parekh and all the guys at Shotput Ventures like David Cummings and Mitch Free).  I've long said it's the entrepreneurs that will ""save Atlanta"" -- if there is such as thing that people believe is necessary.<p>I'm very much rooting for Atlanta.  Not to become yet-another-failed-silicon-valley replication attempt.  Wow, gives a f* about that.  I'm rooting for Atlanta to become it's own identity: something more powerful, more creative, more sustainable and more unique.  Something that people say: ""you can only do that in Atlanta"".",1235867490

Minorities are not represented at the same proportion of their general population percentages anywhere in the country.</i><p>I think this misses the point. In Silicon Valley, several minority populations are well-represented in the startup community. In particular, many startups are started by Asians and by people born outside the U.S. These groups are much less represented in Atlanta, and it's a catch-22 but this makes it tough for Atlanta to attract those startups.",1235867358

498623,comment,498244,498427,0,0,willwagner,,,"The odds can vary a bit on where the hole is located and what kind of grass is next to the hole.  When you are looking at these averages they are hitting a golf ball on to a green, which typically is rather soft and allows the ball to stop relatively close to where it lands. A well hit shot that lands on the green with backspin, will slow the ball down quickly, and then it rolls at a speed which may be slow enough where it can fall into the hole.<p>If you are trying to hit a ball into a hole at a driving range, the driving range could have either longer grass that slows the ball down quicker or alternatively, it could be on concrete with artificial turf, both of which would make it harder for someone like a PGA professional to find the optimum place to hit the ball.<p>That being said, it would have been an interesting business prospect to try an arbitrage the contest by buying a large amount of tickets and hiring a PGA pro.",1235866890

3816180,comment,3815854,3816066,3,0,davemel37,,,"I Agree. More importantly, there seems to be a flawed assumption in this opinion piece that friendship has to be either sexual or platonic.<p>I would argue that every relationship with every human being has both emotional drivers (chemistry) and surface dynamics that don't necessarily reflect those deeper emotions and feelings at play, but rather serve a utility or provide some sort of mutually beneficial value.<p>In other words, why can't someone be friends with someone, get whatever value they hope to get out of the relationship (i.e. shared interests, working relationship, etc...)and also have deeper sexual drivers at play, which many times will not only never surface, but they would never admit to others and many times even to themselves.<p>I think someone tying feminism and equal rights into this discussion not only has no understanding of human nature and how and why we have seek out friendship and relationships, but may very well be the root of the discrimination and objectification that leads to sexual harrasement, etc...<p>Every decision we make meets an emotional need and is justified after the fact with logic and reasoning. Why would relationships under any context be any different.<p>Just to be clear, I am not saying you cant have a relationship without someone being sexually interested, I am just saying it really doesn't and shouldn't matter and really isn't relevant unless it is on the surface or comes to fruition.",1333958363

Yeah, well, you can find thousands of counter-examples to that kind of principle. No one would ever have launched a rocket if they were not perfectionist at heart in the first place. You would not have thousands of products with almost no defects in your supermarket if there was no thorough QA system in place in every industry.

3816116,comment,3815451,3816099,10,0,sho_hn,,,"> The problem, however, is that Qt has no foothold in mobile devices.<p>It's more or less an open secret that Nokia has a Linux/Qt-based S40 replacement powered by Qt in the works, from all the rumors floating around (keyword ""Meltemi""). I'll not speculate on its success potential; Nokia has disappointed me in the past. As a Qt user, I do hope it will do well.<p>> There is a huge community of users that uses Qt to just write (and maintain) desktop applications.<p>Believe me, I know. I write and maintain some of them. I'm a KDE developer.<p>> Qt Quick sucks for that.<p>Depends. We're getting some rather good mileage out of QML in our desktop shell, actually, and for some _componments_ of regular applications it'll do very nicely in short order as well.<p>I agree that Quick isn't there yet in terms of being a full QWidget replacement, though. Right now there's somewhat of a gulf where some things that are hard with QWidget are wonderfully easy with QML, but once you leave QML's prime areas of competence and need to customize, it gets a lot harder than customizing QWidget tends to be.<p>The Ars article actually cites a really good example that I've hit upon myself, as one of the apps I maintain is a heavy user of QTextDocument technology. Because the QML Text items do not allow low-level access to the QTextDocument they're based on, if you want to do advanced QTextDocument stuff in QML, you need to go quite low-level and write your own QML items in C++. It's doable, but QTextBrowser & Co allow more direct access under the hood and don't invite that overhead.<p>However, QWidget is staying put in Qt 5, and QML is still relatively young. There's ample time for a transition to occur. Let's hope it'll work out well.<p>> For those users, the future of Qt seems bleak: it's not in the hands of a company that caters to that audience (Trolltech's primary source of income was Qt, Nokia's is cell phones) and development pace is glacial.<p>While I'm onboard with a healthy dose of skepticism and staying aware of possible trouble, my own outlook is really not that bleak. Under Nokia, Qt has become a pretty decent open source project with working contribution paths - something it never was under Trolltech. KDE has contributed tens of thousands of lines of code to Qt thanks to that, and we remain a heavy user of QWidget at the momemt. I'm not saying we wouldn't be even better off if Nokia were more interested in the desktop, but I feel we have a shot at making our own future.<p>(Of course, KDE is also looking at mobile; see our tablet user interface Plasma Active. It won't surprise you to learn that it's quite heavily based on QML.)",1333955909

Maybe one of the two of you is already in a relationship, maybe you anticipate too much emotional complexity, maybe you're already having enough sex and just don't feel motivated. Of course, there's always a chance that if two people like this end up in the right situation, something could happen, but it's far from a certainty.<p>In my experience this kind of friendship is actually very common, especially among large mixed gender friend groups. The dynamic only ever seems to frustrate the guys who aren't getting any--but in those cases it's really just the frustration of not getting any being projected into the friendships. If the guy finds a girlfriend or whatever then the tension disappears.",1333955474

I suppose this may just come down to semantics (the definition of perfectionism), but I don't think being a perfectionist necessarily means that one is incapable of deciding when to release and move on.<p>I've been a perfectionist my entire life. In elementary school, I used to do all my work in pen. It felt neater and more permanent. When I was forced to use pencil, I would throw away entire sheets of paper rather than erase and leave a smudge. In high school, my latin teacher called me ""Mr. P"", short for ""Mr. Perfection."" He'd hold up my quizzes for the class to see, and laugh at how I used a ruler to perfectly frame the declension tables I'd drawn, and how I'd used my pencil to lightly shade the background of the title row.<p>Excessive? Yes. But I've learned to reign it in and use it to my advantage.<p>A huge percentage of the success of any creative endeavor (whether it's painting, programming, song-writing, whatever) boils down to how much effort its creator put into it. Often, the only difference between a good creator and a great one is the amount of time they spend striving for perfection. If your goal is greatness, a tendency to say ""good enough"" prematurely can be disastrous. No, give me a pupil with an eye for perfection and the perseverance to achieve it, prioritization skills be damned. I can <i>teach</i> him to prioritize.<p>A pragmatic perfectionist is a force to be reckoned with.",1333955307

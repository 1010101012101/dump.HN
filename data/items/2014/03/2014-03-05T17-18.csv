With nodejs and the source-map-support module, there is 0 issues. As for documentation there are tool that allow doc generation from cs source files, test generation for from cs classes ,etc ... There is a reason why there is all these transpiled languages around js, because most people just dont like writing JS code.",1394042155

Same goes for Coffee.<p>I&#x27;m sorry to hear that you don&#x27;t have a culture of learning and teaching other people at your company new technologies.<p>> Second, both languages make debugging a harder process. When something breaks and I try to fix it, I can&#x27;t always tell right away whether it&#x27;s due to poorly written logic, or simply improperly written code.<p>Both CoffeeScript and Haml have syntax errors so you can tell whether your error is syntax related or not.<p>> Lastly, there are just too many dependencies.<p>If you&#x27;re using Rails, which it sounds like you are, the coffee-rails gem is in your Gemfile by default.

E.g. in the early days, assembly developer could not see an advantage in using a higher-level language such as C (:D), and when FORTRAN eventually came around, C programmers didn&#x27;t really want to use that either. Why? Because if you spent time and energy on becoming proficient in something, be it assembly or javascript, the defensive but natural position of most people is to be skeptical of new ideas, because they diminish the value of their knowledge. If you&#x27;re an expert in writing OO-code in JavaScript, and suddenly CoffeeScript comes around and lets everyone write &quot;class&quot; and be done with it, your JavaScript OO knowledge becomes less valuable.<p>Bottom line, I can hardly imagine anyone who&#x27;d be able to learn CSS, JavaScript, HTML and perhaps another backend language, including all the quirks and weirdness associated with these technologies, and then _not_ be able to wrap their heads around e.g. HAML, if presented with proper guidance. The same goes for CoffeeScript, even if the learning curve might be a little steeper than for HAML.<p>So are these specific technologies good ideas? I&#x27;d definitely say &quot;yes&quot; for HAML, and &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot; for CoffeeScript (TypeScript perhaps?)... For both technologies, I agree with lucisferre:<p>> 2.

Math profs and books on mathematics <i>never</i> explain what the symbols mean. They just throw symbols at you and then do tricks with them and expect you to figure out that this symbol means &quot;derivative&quot; in this context. I have literally seen math texts that <i>never</i> explain the language itself, introducing reams of new math with no definitions for mathematical notation used.<p>I&#x27;ve looked for a good &quot;dictionary of math&quot; -- a book that explains every mathematical notation in existence and what it means <i>conceptually</i> -- and have never found such a thing. It&#x27;s like some medieval guild craft that is passed down only by direct lineage among mathematicians.<p>Concepts are often never explained either. I remember struggling in calculus. The professor showed us how to do a derivative, so I mechanically followed but had no idea why I was doing what I was doing. I called up my father and he said one single sentence to me: &quot;A derivative is a rate of change.&quot;<p><i>A derivative is a rate of change.</i><p>I completed his thought: so an integral is its inverse. Bingo. From then on I understood calculus. The professor never explained this, and the textbook did in such an unclear and oblique way that the concept was never adequately communicated. It&#x27;s one g&#x27;damn sentence! The whole of calculus! Just f&#x27;ing say it! &quot;A derivative is a rate of change!&quot;<p>(2) The notation is horrible.<p>If math were a programming language it would be C++, maybe even Perl. There are many symbols to do the same thing. Every sub-discipline or application-area of mathematics seems to have its own quirky style of notation and sometimes these styles even conflict with each other.<p>Yet baroque languages like C++ and Perl at least document their syntax. If you read an intro to C++ book it begins its chapter on templates by explaining both what templates are for and the fact that type<int> means &quot;type is templated on int.&quot;<p>Math doesn&#x27;t do this. It doesn&#x27;t explain its syntax. See point #1 above.",1394040195

7348212,comment,7346249,7347792,2,0,adwf,,,"I&#x27;d probably suggest some sort of restriction on IAP amounts.  Under-16s in the UK can play fruit machines, but only upto a £5 jackpot before it gets classified as adult gambling where serious amounts of money can be lost.  This is on the assumption that people won&#x27;t bother putting more than £5 in, as they know that they won&#x27;t make a profit.  This assumption doesn&#x27;t hold in the IAP-world as the &quot;profit&quot; for the player is ostensibly, having a fun time.  Although as the article shows, in reality a lot of these game monetisation tactics are really about players paying to remove an artificially enforced <i>pain</i> on the player, rather than to increase the fun.<p>So maybe just a hard limit on <i>total</i> IAP purchases for each game targeted at under-16s.<p>Also, the same restrictions that apply to gambling advertising should apply to F2P/IAP games, for the exact same reasons.<p>The trickiest part about it would be defining what <i>is</i> an acceptable game vs. an unacceptable game for the purposes of regulation.  When does an acceptable F2P game like Team Fortress 2 become an unacceptable game like Candy Crush Saga?  Maybe there are some people out there who think TF2 is completely unacceptable too.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it isn&#x27;t difficult, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it shouldn&#x27;t be done.  In my mind I see both gambling and these F2P &quot;money&quot; games occupying the exact same ethical arena.<p>EDIT:\nThe hard cap on IAP purchases for under-16s doesn&#x27;t even need to be all that low, it just needs to exist <i>at all</i>.  Placing it at £30 would limit the potential damage done to the child, whilst also being relatively fair to the game company as it&#x27;s roughly the same price as a game bought off the shelf.",1394039971

If Javascript appears scary, spend more time with Javascript so groking it becomes easier for your brain. Making a tangental change to a completely different syntax seems like a wasted investment. When debugging in the browser, you&#x27;re still going to require knowledge of JS, even with source mapping. Delving into other libraries will still require knowledge of JS.

If you write a put option, and it is executed, then you have to buy the stock for its strike price, which will be above its market price (that&#x27;s why the put was executed in the first place). You end up buying the stock at a <i>premium</i>, not at a discount.<p>Here&#x27;s a concrete example. A stock is trading at $100 and you write a put on it struck at $90, earning a premium of (say) $5. Then the stock falls to $80 and the put is executed, so you buy the stock for $90.<p>You now have something worth $80 and a $5 premium, but you paid $90, so you are $5 out of pocket.<p>Now you write a covered call on the stock struck at $100, earning a $3 premium (because it&#x27;s further out of the money the the put you wrote earlier). The stock goes to $110, so you sell it to the call owner for $100. That&#x27;s nice, you&#x27;ve earned the $3 premium and you sold the stock for $10 more than you bought it for (a total of $13 up). But if you hadn&#x27;t written the call, you could have sold the stock for $110, and been $20 up instead.<p>If you also buy a protective put (say for $1) then that&#x27;s an additional loss you bear in this scenario, since you can&#x27;t execute the put.<p>If you&#x27;re writing options, you&#x27;re basically betting against market volatility.

7348142,comment,7346959,7347898,2,0,firstOrder,,,"Currency is a commodity, just like any other commodity.  Why have certain commodities, such as gold, often become currencies over the past millennia?  Because certain commodities like gold are durable, divisible, portable, uniform etc. and thus make good currencies.  The US dollar was just a note exchangable for equivalent gold at the Federal Reserve until 1971.<p>States have tried to issue currencies without backing for thousands of years.  Have any of those currencies lasted long?  The answer is no.  There&#x27;s nothing about the US dollar which makes me think it will be any different than such schemes hatched in Ancient Mesopotamia or Greece.  In fact the worth of three dollars today is about equivalent to one 1980 dollar.  The dollar will not retain its value over time, while an ounce of gold from 4000 years ago has a somewhat equivalent value to an ounce of gold today.  Inevitably there will be a crisis of confidence, and the dollar, euro, yen etc. will either become worthless, or will be backed by gold, or silver or the like.  It&#x27;s not as if governments today have some magic which makes their dollars and euros valuable in a way that governments 2000 years ago could not.<p>I can pay taxes with dollars, I can go to USPS and buy stuff, I can go to an Army PX and buy stuff - but this only goes so far.  The day will come, maybe decades from now, maybe a century or two from now, when a crisis of confidence happens and the dollar either becomes worthless or backed by gold from Fort Knox.<p>If the dollar has a real underlying value - WHY does the government still stockpile gold in Fort Knox?<p>Again I want to stress I&#x27;m talking historically and what must happen in a century or two.  I am not claiming the dollar&#x27;s value will collapse in the next year.  But if it is not backed by a real commodity once a real crisis of confidence occurs, then it will inevitably lose its value.<p>Scarcity has nothing to do with it.  The dollar until 1971 backed by the commodity gold, is the historical norm.  The past 40-something years is the historic abnormality.  Which will inevitably transform back to the old way.",1394039359

I used Haml until I found Slim. Haml syntax vagaries bit me more than Slim&#x27;s did.<p>I love Coffeescript and use it whenever I can, for the reason that the compiler output generated by it is better than my own Javascript. I consider the complexity of the added layer to be worth it. 95% of the time Coffeescript saves me time writing, and the 5% of the time spent debugging is made easier with the tool at coffeescript.org. My javascript workflow has only been enhanced by Coffeescript, not hurt. Then again, I don&#x27;t write large, sprawling programs in Javascript and consider it a smell when it does start getting complex.<p>I can&#x27;t say the same about Slim, it hasn&#x27;t been an unqualified boon, but still overall I feel it&#x27;s an improvement.",1394038979

Thats because haml was built to solve Rails developers problems not frontend developers problems like say less or sass was (and you can see how those are doing).<p>With coffeescript, the two problems are<p>- writing coffeescript is fun, coming back to make sense of what you wrote months later is an absolute nightmare<p>- debugging it is a massive PITA<p>Coffeescript is mostly syntactic sugar that gives you a lot of other benefits but, again, if you want to move quickly as a dev team its one more thing for people to learn or know when they come on line and maintaining it can be a real hassle.<p>On my current team, we started out on an app that had an even split between haml and erb templates, we stopped doing haml and only do erb now. We started out with some coffeescript but after running into the problems mentioned above, we don&#x27;t write any new coffeescript.<p>That is not to say certain teams won&#x27;t prosper by embracing these two abstractions, just that in my experience the benefits aren&#x27;t usually worth it.

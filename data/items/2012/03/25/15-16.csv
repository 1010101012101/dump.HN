You'll enjoy a very equal male/female ratio (at least in your living quarters and some courses), and you get to study a broad diverse set of topics constantly.  And for the most part you get to select what you study.<p>To steal a famous quote -- college is wasted on the young.  ;-)  I think if you were to ask most 30-50 year olds if they could drop most of their current responsibilities (with impunity) and go to college full time, the vast majority would.<p>As someone who has started start-ups, joined start ups, consulted, and worked for F100 companies -- you have your whole life to work.

The fact that people generally think checked exceptions are a bad idea is a point <i>against</i> Go, not in favor of it.<p>Checked exceptions are superior to Go's error return codes anyway, since they make it easier to bubble your errors up to your caller.",1332690626
3752870,comment,3750091,3750424,2,0,odnamra,,,"I love this. You are correct on all accounts. In theory, creating a movie is about telling a story with the best possible content and the best possible experience. You might laugh at the thought, but I can promise you that all filmmakers toil under that aspiration. Actors, hair, makeup, wardrobe, location, sfx, vfx, audio, music... ALL handcrafted and laboriously created in pursuit of telling the story as best you can. Theaters, Blu-ray, Dolby, HD, 3D, all developed in the hopes of creating the best possible experience for that content. I'm not saying there isn't a lot of crap (lord knows I've personally worked on many terrible movies), but I'm speaking of ideals here. Shall we Kill Hollywood and replace everything with cat videos on Youtube? That's too easy. I can offer many suggestions on how to vindictively kill Hollywood right now, but that would be a disservice to people like you who just want to enjoy watching a movie. And it's because Hollywood contains this fantastic talent base, and enormous back catalog, that they will be around for a long time to come.",1332690591

However, in many scientific diaciplines (math, physics, biology, chemistry) it is virtually impossible to succeed without focused mentorship, an immersive environment, and in the case of experimental science, capital funding. I would also guess that many types of engineering require a similar atmosphere.<p>That is basically the reason why I find these discussions too sweeping and generalizing to be valid. What works for one person or field, might not apply to another.<p>In addition, for those who can afford it, college provides a tremendous general education and exploration opportunity.",1332690566

Once these patterns, best practices, and the tools exist, suddenly the bar of creating good looking UI and decent usability becomes lower and cheaper.<p>2) Not everyone wants to pay premium on good UI.

You'll get, for instance, people who read Effective Java [1], by Joshua Bloch (who is, IMHO, THE man when it comes to java), and remembered the PECS mnemonics.\nPECS stands for producer-extends, consumer-super.<p>So, to cite the textbook example, say you are implementing a Stack<E>. It will probably have the methods:<p><pre><code>  public void push(E element);\n  public E pop();\n</code></pre>\nand, for convenience:<p><pre><code>  public void pushAll(Iterable<? extends E> elements);\n  public void popAll(Collection<? super E> destination);\n</code></pre>\nThe pushAll has ""? extends"" because the elements Iterable will ""produce"" elements for the stack. The popAll has super because the destination Collection will ""consume"" elements from the stack. It is not that hard, is it? Let's note that guard-of-terra is talking about proficiency, not mere familiarity. I believe reading ""Effective Java"" is a nice way to get closer to the proficient level.<p>Let it be noted that this whole mess exists because generics in Java were implemented with type erasure so their introduction wouldn't break legacy code. I personally think this was a bad idea, but it does show that when a language is evolving, there are a bunch of constraints the designers must be aware of.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1332688982&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp...</a>",1332689373

3752818,comment,3752683,3752683,5,0,itsprofitbaron,,,"First of all, the reasons artists are signing to labels are because of several reasons. For instance, if you (an artist) want to work with a well-known producer then you need to pay them immediately for their work which can range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars  which is before often generally taking a cut from sales of records too. Additionally, they also have to pay for the use of recording studios (even if the producer owns it), backing singers, special amp/FX required during the recording as well as, paying for the entourage of the producer to get to the recording studio etc. Most artists dont have tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to immediately for this hence, they sign to a record label that can front the money for doing so.<p>Even if startups were disrupting this space - and there are some - the fact that artists have to pay producers up front etc is a challenge for them to overcome  and record labels at the moment are a very good solution for this.<p>I mean even Jamal Edwards (the founder of SB:TV  <a href=""http://www.sbtv.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sbtv.com</a>  he's used as part of Google Chrome advertising in the UK - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKpvwlSGOI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKpvwlSGOI</a> and even he has launched a Record Label albeit with Sony - <a href=""http://www.rwdmag.com/2011/02/sb-tv-founder-jamal-edwards-signs-label-deal-with-sony-rca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rwdmag.com/2011/02/sb-tv-founder-jamal-edwards-si...</a> and he was kind of disrupting the music industry by promoting artists that you may previously never of heard of. \n(For instance, I first heard about Ed Sheeran - before he became famous and gone on to release numerous hits - through SB:TV's YouTube Channel)<p>Some music startups specifically covering what you said in the text area are the likes of:<p><a href=""https://www.webceleb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.webceleb.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.nimbit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimbit.com/</a><p><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://soundcloud.com/</a> - Although Music Labels are often on there contacting users.<p>MegaUpload were planning on launching MegaBox/MegaKey before, all the stuff with them happened as well - which was to help unsigned artists/artists sell their music and keep 90% of earnings and to pay them for FREE downloads.<p>There are a few others as well but, I can't really remember them off the top of my head.<p>However, with regards to ""disrupting the music industry"" other interesting music startups to make a note of - <i>and Ive probably missed a load out since Im just recalling them from what I can remember</i> -  as well as the obvious choices of Rdio, Grooveshark, MOG, Spotify, Pandora, Shazam and Last.fm (can they still be called a startup?!) etc and the ones listed above include:<p><a href=""http://www.earbits.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earbits.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.mixlr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mixlr.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.like.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.like.fm</a><p><a href=""http://www.deezer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deezer.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.audiovroom.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.audiovroom.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.soundtrckr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soundtrckr.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.songkick.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.songkick.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.thesixtyone.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thesixtyone.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.22tracks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.22tracks.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.watzatsong.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.watzatsong.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.macjams.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macjams.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.stereomood.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stereomood.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.tunesbag.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tunesbag.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.ex.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ex.fm</a><p><a href=""http://www.ejamming.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ejamming.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mixcloud.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.thounds.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thounds.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.gigjunkie.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigjunkie.net</a><p><a href=""http://www.ujam.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ujam.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.citysounds.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citysounds.fm</a><p><a href=""http://www.mugasha.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mugasha.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.mspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mspot.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.bandzoogle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bandzoogle.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.playgroundsessions.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.playgroundsessions.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.tastebuds.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tastebuds.fm</a><p>There are <i>tons</i> more but these are just a few I can remember off the top of my head with regards to disrupting the music industry as a whole, and with regards to your specific question.",1332689366

3752764,comment,3751767,3752680,2,0,droithomme,,,"Interesting, I didn't catch from the article that this three-year bump model had been tested on multiple incidents and found to correlate. It mentions in the third paragraph their methodology used ""a pattern that, in Atlanta, indicated cheating in multiple schools"". It seems Atlanta was the only place they are claiming there was a correlation, but even of this single data point they offer no specific evidence beyond the red dot in their graph. I did find it interesting that the biggest recent case where there was systematic corruption within a system was in Atlanta, and the newspaper here trying to show that cheating is common throughout the rest of the US and not just something special in Atlanta is Atlanta's leading newspaper.<p>Recent analyses of data on 18,000 teachers in New Yock City has shown that year to year testing results are not as consistent as one would assume.<p><a href=""http://news.firedoglake.com/2012/03/07/data-analysis-of-value-added-teacher-model-shows-no-correlation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.firedoglake.com/2012/03/07/data-analysis-of-valu...</a><p>> Gary Rubinstein has been analyzing the data at his site, and hes found some incredible results. First, he found that theres almost no correlation among teachers year-over-year in the data. A teacher is likely to be judged as effective one year and ineffective the next. The average change in performance was a relatively large 25 points, and it did not fit with commonly accepted beliefs that teachers improve performance over time, particularly between the first and second year.<p><a href=""http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/2012/02/26/analyzing-released-nyc-value-added-data-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/2012/02/26/analyzing-re...</a><p>> Looking over the data, I found that 50% of the teachers had a 21 point swing one way or the other.  There were even teachers who had gone up or down as much as 80 points.  The average change was 25 points.  I also noticed that 49% of the teachers got lower value-added in 2010 than they did in 2009, contrary to my experience that most teachers improve from year to year.<p>> With a correlation coefficient of .35, the scatter plot shows that teachers are not consistent from year to year ... nor do a good number of them go up<p>These sorts of results where the data is available to the public for analysis makes me skeptical that testing results are actually consistent from year to year and that inconsistencies are evidence of cheating.<p>I contrast these findings to the AJC article's claim that ""Experts say student learning doesnt typically jump backwards."" The article does not state which experts they refer to, what their qualifications are, or what exactly they have said. That is suspicious to me, especially since the article has many quotes where they are no so shy about identifying their sources. Shouldn't it be even more critical to identify specific sources when using an appeal to authority argument citing ""experts""? Especially when in cases where we have actual data, such as the study I cite above, scores did in fact jump backwards 49% of the time. This difference between empirical data and vague assertions by unnamed experts is suspicious. I must wonder who are these experts.<p>Mind you, I think there is cheating. I am highly skeptical that the AJC's method has been shown to be a valid way to identify where it is happening.",1332688140

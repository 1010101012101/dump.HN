He can&#x27;t pay it back in any logical sense before he dies.<p>Although now she owes him child support every month.  But any payment she makes goes right back to her, to be deducted against what he owes her.[1]<p>Friends and family have given him a place to live where he acts as a stay-at-home dad, since for now working is useless (and the child require 24/7 monitoring by adults). If friends and family were to give him the money to pay off the debt, it would just give the money to his ex, and there is no guarantee that she would then start paying her side of the debt.[1]  I guess <i>she</i> would then be the one unable to get a driver&#x27;s license and go to work and pay child support, which is &quot;justice&quot; only in a weird warped sense of the word in that they each have suffered the same kind of injustice, and doesn&#x27;t really help the kids.<p>[1] The ideal situation is to just have both debts neutralize each other and disappear, but it&#x27;s not clear that this would be binding even if you could get the two angry ex&#x27;es to agree to it -- parents have signed off on child support in the past only to have the courts put it in place anyway, since the <i>kids</i> couldn&#x27;t sign it away.",1439567985

An accomplishment nearly no other company has ever done.<p>Meerkat had the remarkably obvious and unoriginal idea of having this hyper successful platform also host some live streaming video. In implementing this obvious extension to the Twitter platform they ignored the effect of their intrusive updates on the UX for everyone else in violation of the terms of service.<p>Twitter decided that the experience of posting media on Twitter is their department and acted accordingly. In the process Meerkat&#x27;s founders and investors were deprived of the opportunity to become billionaires in exchange for a few months of development and a trip to Austin.

However, like I said to someone else, unless you reverse engineer every update to your OS, you really shouldn&#x27;t be commenting. This is just as much &quot;giving a foreign entity control over your data&quot; as using an OS provided in binary form is giving a foreign entity control over your CPU, which would be far, far worse really. Unless you&#x27;re manually validating the code in all cryptography products you use, there&#x27;s really no argument to be made here.<p>> Encrypt the image with the public key of your friends and send it to them, that is privately.<p>When you do this, say using PGP, PGP generates a static key, encrypts that key to their public key and encrypts the message using the static key.<p>This is essentially the same thing, the only difference being that the Up1 does only the static key portion and does not provide the public key portion, which you can do out of band using whatever method you prefer, be it PGP, SSL to a private server, OTR, TextSecure, etc.<p>And it allows the transfer of images and small files in this secure form to be incredibly simple and fast. Pipe into a command line tool or use ShareX, paste that link over a secured protocol and you&#x27;ve securely shared a file.<p>Of course, if you don&#x27;t trust the public Up1 instance, feel free to run your own, it&#x27;s all open source, server included.<p>> And, worse, I have to activate JavaScript, which decreases security by a lot.<p>It&#x27;s a trade-off, privacy for a slightly increased risk of security, these days you&#x27;re more likely to get exploited by a fucking web font than by a script though.<p>Worst case, like I said, don&#x27;t trust the public instance if you don&#x27;t want to (well, if you&#x27;re the type who doesn&#x27;t trust their OS provider at least).

Mainly, it&#x27;s a tool for managers to feel important. That&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no need to optimize that except to make it go away, for which there is a great need in this industry. If it was a tool for managers to get updates, they&#x27;d use email, chat or something saner. Standups put developers under pressure unnecessarily and offer nothing to the development process in return. It&#x27;s sad that they even exist and they&#x27;re a perfect example of managers who don&#x27;t know how to manage and can&#x27;t figure out a proper way to stay updated. They make developers angry and less productive because now the developers are stressing over what they&#x27;re going to say in the standup rather than developing. Yet another terrible idea from the agile camp that seems to have no shortage of such terrible ideas.<p>EDIT: Note that all the information available in standups is also available on a board or ticketing system for a manager&#x27;s perusal anytime. That to me proves the uselessness of the standup and its only purpose being to make managers feel in control.",1439567820

But, it&#x27;s dangerous to challenge the current management religion unless you are in a position of power.<p>The solution is the time-honored practice of keeping two sets of books. Even if your true stand-up report would be:<p><pre><code>  Yesterday: thinking.
  Today: thinking more.
  Blockers: meetings like this.
</code></pre>
You would be well-advised not to say so. Instead, you need to identify or invent some small subsidiary tasks that can be used for stand-up reporting, e.g.:<p><pre><code>  Yesterday: designed alternate schema for one of the database tables.
  Today: timing tests with new schema.
  Blockers: none.
</code></pre>
In this way, you can carry out your research, which may involve a meandering path, fuzzy ideas that are hard to express verbally, backtracking, and work in units of multiple days, in private. While doing so, you have a parallel public task list that follows the scrum agenda and can be used to keep people off your back while you work on the actual problems that need to be solved.",1439567732

I mean, sometimes people have a problem that needs some crosstalk, and they might go a little longer, but that should be rare and the person running the meeting should aggressively push that stuff to after the meeting whenever possible.<p>IMO, at least, if your team takes more than 15 minutes going through 60-90 second blurbs of their day, your team either needs to get better at succinctly summarizing their stuff (and aggressively pushing side conversations to follow-ups after the meeting) or your team&#x27;s too big.",1439567724

Ansible or Puppet don&#x27;t offer any of those things. We have built-in deployment for Chef, for instance. We try hard not to duplicate functionality that you can get elsewhere (for example, systems management, log monitoring.)<p>Those are designed for systems management, and they&#x27;re good at that. We&#x27;re designed for complex, multi-tiered user management with a focus on the user, not the system. (Hence our name) We view these as orthogonal directions, and it makes sense to use Userify with a good devops/cf system like Ansible/Chef/Puppet/Salt/etc.<p>Small shops can still manually manage a dozen or so users across a few groups of servers. We&#x27;ve got a bunch of companies with hundreds of servers and less than 10 devops across all of them.<p>For companies like that, Userify gives a bunch of other benefits.. for example, you can rotate your SSH keys without requesting a production code deployment, or update an SSH key without write access to git, or remove a contractor&#x27;s account on their last day, etc.<p>On-boarding and off-boarding get a lot easier, rotating keys is easier, training users is easier, managing lots of different role sets is easier, and Userify doesn&#x27;t require any changes to PAM or NSS modules -- installing is a one-liner and it just uses /usr/sbin/adduser and /etc/sudoers.d.<p>The shim is just a few hundred lines.. read through it at <a href=""https://github.com/userify/shim"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/userify/shim</a>",1439567547

It was a straight bit of road, everyone was mostly in the right lane (sign said to keep right unless to pass). Out of nowhere a state trooper pulls up on the left, passes, gets in front of our car and pulls over the guy in front of us. I should mention that the car in front of us was from out of state. Now, it is possible that that guy was getting pulled over for something other than speeding, but as anyone that&#x27;s driven through VA can tell you, the state troopers there are very eager to give out speeding tickets, so chances are it was for speeding. Why did that guy arbitrarily get pulled over instead of our car, or any of the two dozen around us, all doing the same speed? Probably because it was a nice car with an out of state license plate. 75 mph is not an unreasonable speed on a straight road during daytime with good visibility and weather. It&#x27;s basically left to the police to determine what the real speed limit is, which seems wrong.<p></rant>",1439567327

This presentation was presented at Black Hat USA 2015<p>Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) radio receivers can be found in many new cars and are often integrated into what has become known as the “infotainment system” – typically a large screen in the dashboard that the vehicle occupants interact with to control anything from what music is playing, to making phone calls, to viewing vehicle diagnostic information.<p>In many cases the infotainment system is connected to the same network as computers that control physical aspects of the vehicle e.g. steering and braking. This is because automated functionality is becoming more common in modern vehicles – the ability to automatically park a vehicle at the press of a button requires a computer to be able to electronically control the steering. These are known as “cyber-physical” systems as there is computer (cyber) control of what was traditionally, a manual, physical process such as steering the vehicle. Therefore, an attacker who finds a way to gain control of an infotainment system can in many cases use that platform to attack more sensitive, safety-critical vehicle functions.<p>DAB radio is significantly more feature-rich than its predecessor (FM). Although FM could broadcast simple textual messages such as the radio station name via the Radio Data System (RDS), DAB broadcasts can include much more text, with international langue support, images, web pages and even video.<p>All of this complexity increases the “attack surface” (number of avenues of attack) of a receiver.<p>Download the slides from Andy Davis’ talk at Black Hat USA here.<p>Published date:  06 August 2015",1439567052

I view all of these statements as clarification of a single argument and its originations.  That argument involves no conspiracy theories, simply a suspicion of price fixing (that&#x27;s not an outlandish suspicion, in my opinion.  I mean...drive manufacturers have been found guilty of it before...)<p>I don&#x27;t think it is a <i>conspiracy</i> that <i>some</i> enterprise drives come in odd form factors, you completely misread that part of what I said.  My point was that, <i>normally</i> the most advanced enterprise drives come in strange (i.e. much larger) form factors.  This is because they have not yet worked the size and power requirements down to fit the smaller form factor, which makes complete sense.  However, <i>this</i> drive uses a standard form factor, which tells me it is not &quot;bleeding edge.&quot;  There are probably rack mount SSDs with much higher capacities than 16TB.<p>So, the reason it seems weird is that they have obviously passed that hurdle with the 16TB offering.  They can now fit 16TBs of SSD storage in a <i>standard</i> form factor.  It is odd because if they can fit 16TBs, and we assume that at scale, the variable costs are almost exclusively due to the capacity of the chips, why is there not a consumer drive even a factor of 4 smaller (i.e. 4TB) available?  I understand there not being a 16TB drive...or a 12TB, 8TB, etc... available.  But a factor of 16 seems oddly large.",1439566978

I&#x27;ve already said it&#x27;s not an excuse and harassment is <i>never</i> OK. I&#x27;ve already stated, <i>twice now</i> and this is a <i>third time</i> that I&#x27;m not taking the actions of the article into consideration so harassment is not the issue here. Do you understand? I want to make sure I&#x27;m being very explicit with my communication that this has <i>nothing</i> to do with harassment. I am talking about a scenario of <i>undesired continued communication</i> that does not have the <i>intentions</i> of harassing (sexual or otherwise).<p><i>>Women do not make a binary choice between either &quot;being afraid of you&quot; or &quot;being attracted to you.&quot; If you are a friendly and reasonable person then you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</i><p>You&#x27;re now taking it out of the scenario. <i>She was avoiding me</i>. There&#x27;s two reasons I can think of for actively avoiding someone. One of those is fear. The other is embarrassment. If you&#x27;d like to open my mind and give me more motives for avoiding someone <i>for this context</i>, feel free. But it seems <i>very</i> binary to me <i>in this scenario</i>.<p><i>>If you ask someone out and they say &quot;I&#x27;m busy&quot; a few too many times, maybe you just take the hint and move on, no?</i><p>And if they are legitimately busy? I&#x27;m finding it funny your chosen examples have all happened to me and all of them resulted in relationships. Do you have another example?<p><i>>The argument that &quot;I&#x27;m too ignorant to know when women don&#x27;t want my attention&quot; is nonsense</i><p>I don&#x27;t see why you keep making this gendered. I&#x27;ve already provided an example with the genders swapped. It works both ways and has nothing to do with ignorance. It has to do with a failure of communication (which is an important part of getting along and living among other human beings). Please respond to the tldr, this is a test to ensure you&#x27;re actually reading my responses. When I entered this conversation and until this point it&#x27;s always been about implicit messages being poor (and harmful) for communication.<p>I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb here and claim you do not understand how communication works. Communication requires the <i>meaning</i> of the message to be understood and agreed upon. When a message is ambiguous in meaning (non-direct, implicit) the meaning of the message can be received in a manner not intended by the person giving the message.<p>The best example of this is cultural differences in the meaning of an action. Even small things like putting soy sauce on your rice can have an entirely different meaning in Japan than in America. In Japan it can be considered <i>rude</i> while people in America <i>wouldn&#x27;t even give it a second thought</i>. If I wanted to offend you, I could drown your rice in soy sauce. Now depending on your cultural background - I&#x27;ve either offended you, or you&#x27;re unaware that my message was meant as an offense. Because this implicit meaning behind a physical mention is interpreted differently in different cultures.<p>Implicit messages are <i>terrible</i> for communication. The ability for the meaning to be misunderstood or improperly conveyed is <i>astounding</i>. If you want someone to leave you alone it is important to be explicit. Especially when your implicit messages are <i>ambiguous</i>.<p>TL;DR<p>At best you can hope that when you mean &quot;A&quot; they assume &quot;A&quot; instead of &quot;B&quot; when &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are ambiguous. But there is nothing wrong with assuming &quot;B&quot; and it is <i>your fault for failing to communicate</i> if that occurs because your implicit message was too ambiguous. You failed to communicate your intentions of &quot;A&quot; and that failure is <i>on you</i>.<p>ps.<p>America has a culture where people play &quot;hard to get&quot; on purpose. Every example you can think of that is intended to say &quot;stop contacting me I&#x27;m not interested&quot; is also used by these same people as a means of &quot;try harder, I&#x27;m interested but want to make sure you&#x27;re serious&quot;.",1439566347

Yes, Apple&#x27;s managed to implement micropayments with a music service based on 1) bog uniform pricing (99¢ no matter what — though that&#x27;s changed since, no?), and for a fairly standard product <i>for which previews and sampling are readily available in many cases</i> — that is, <i>the buyer has a very good idea of what they&#x27;re buying in most cases.</i><p>And yet... there are numerous alternatives which <i>aren&#x27;t</i> Apple: streaming music services (a bundled, non-micropayments model, either pre-paid or adverts supported), YouTube (adverts). Frankly, I&#x27;ve largely gotten out of the music-buying habit, though I&#x27;ll pick up a CD occasionally at a show.<p>Your points on statement review largely make my point: if the idea of micropayments <i>is to make people rational consumers of content,</i> then <i>if they&#x27;re failing to review and assess their purchase habits,</i> they simply aren&#x27;t rational consumers. Which is to say, the premise of micropayments is false.<p>For long distance, he specifically addresses the case: <i>the cost of attributing billing costs was itself a huge portion of the cost of service itself.</i> By moving to <i>flat pricing</i> you can at once <i>reduce costs</i> and <i>reduce customer anxiety</i> over service use. I&#x27;ve been on flat-fee pay-as-you-go comms plans for years now. For what I&#x27;m paying, it literally isn&#x27;t worth the telco&#x27;s time to compute costs.<p>The kitty payment method is pretty much <i>precisely</i> how music broadcast and public performance (think bars, restaurants, stores) payments work. You&#x27;ve got a few licensing agencies (ASCAP, Harry Fox), playtime measurement (logs from radio stations and the services providing streams to retail establishments), and artists are cut a check based on plays.<p>Various checks and balances keep everything reasonably honest. Performance licenses are held by <i>establishments</i> and not <i>performers</i> -- it&#x27;s the nightclub owner, not the band, who&#x27;s on the hook for the fee. That greatly simplifies logistics -- on the spectrum of unreliable characters, bar owners rate higher than drummers, or even front-men. Shenanigans by the licensing agencies can be pursued by class-actions among musicians (not to say they can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t get screwed, but there are <i>some</i> checks). And the end consumer of the music (bar / nightclub / restaurant / store patron) doesn&#x27;t worry about any of this at all.<p>The whole &quot;rewarding quality&quot; <i>is</i> something to consider, though I&#x27;ll note that Apple dispensed with this entirely at least initially: <i>everything cost the same amount.</i> I can see (and have made) arguments to why this shouldn&#x27;t be the case (high-quality scientific research or investigative journalism strikes me as more worthwhile than algorithmically generated tone patterns). And I&#x27;m not pretending to have a solution fully worked out. But I&#x27;m almost certain it lies in the direction of aggregated, not disaggregated, payments. Broadband tax. Syndication fee. General funds tax. Patronage to creators. Something like that.<p>As for Wikipedia: it follows patterns of collaborative work which date back centuries (review some of the early history of dictionaries and encyclopedias).<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s got numerous problems, of which scaling is one. Trust another.<p>PKI&#x27;s roots trace back to at least 1874 and William Stanley Jevons, who&#x27;s just become even <i>more</i> interesting in my estimation. The primary limitation, aside from successful algorithms, was cheap and ubiquitous computing. As that came online, first for institutions and governments, later for individuals.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any significant discussion that PKI was impossible. One-way functions have been known for centuries. Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman&#x27;s work postdated national security implementations of PKI by British GCHQ by only three years.<p>Discussion of absolutes is risky, but there are a few.<p>I challenge you to exceed 300,000 km/s.<p>Others similarly exist in various fields, including social and economic ones. Part of the basis for my own statements is Gresham&#x27;s Law, which I&#x27;m coming to view as a fundamental and principle limitation for economics. Others would include the Law of Diminishing Returns, and variations of the maximum power principle (Darwin-Lotke energy law, White&#x27;s Law).",1439565778

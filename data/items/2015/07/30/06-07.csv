This allows you to interfere the waveforms of the different lasers in time, as their relative phases are locked. This is very hard to do with continuous wave lasers, but rather routine with short pulsed lasers (e.g. femtosecond).",1438239566

You start with a high peak power laser pulse (e.g. a femtosecond mode locked oscillator) and excite a highly nonlinear process that generates new frequencies (e.g. using a special kind of optical fiber), and at the output you have a continuous broad spectrum. What happens in the fiber is actually similar to sea waves arriving on the beach - a very long and well beahaved wave steepens in the leading edge (which means new frequencies were generated) and eventually breaks/collapses into many small waves of much shorter period. \nThe laser in this article is probably 100x or even more cheaper than a setup like this, but also does not have the full coherence supercontinuum sources have, so it will be used for different things.<p>A picture of the output of a fully coherent white light laser spanning from the uv to ir: <a href=""http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/2011/09/sub-femtosecond-sculpted-light-transients.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/2011/09/sub-femtosec...</a><p>For more cool physics related to this read about frequency combs, which are (most of the time) frequency stabilized supercontinuum lasers.",1438239009

I would rather pay the right person and retain independence over being beholden to a bunch of corps that have time and time again shown to simply &quot;end-of-life&quot;, kill due to &quot;ToS violations&quot; or whatever. In most cases, if you have any kind of meaningful turnover, it is also cheaper. You are happy doing what you do the way you do it? Good for you!<p>Mail is something I would rather keep private, and outsourced mail providers <i>also</i> have issues. Running a mailserver, when you actually know what you are doing, isn&#x27;t difficult, and keeping it available isn&#x27;t either.",1438236213

Unfortunately, laser projectors were only around 15 lumens at the time - I needed bright ambient light for the SLAM stabilisation to work, but simultaneously low light for the laser to be visible. I&#x27;m still waiting for high-lumen hand-held laser projection to be viable.",1438236181

9973358,comment,9973156,9973156,0,0,ssaddi,,,"As a developer, I tend to be now agnostic/indifferent towards programming languages.  Essentially, you can use any programming language to do the job.  The difference lies in developer&#x27;s comfort zone and libraries.  \nFor example, I prefer C# over VB.Net for ASP.NET/MVC backend.  However, for several practical in-house projects, I&#x27;ve found Excel+VBA far quicker over IIS/ASP.NET project.  \nSo, it all depends on the context, your audience and usability of the project.  We should not let technologies drive our projects, but our business users and current trend patterns.  For example, I&#x27;m seeing a lot of JavaScript frameworks being used to deliver responsive and device-independent web applications, such as SPA (Single Page Application).  \nGranted, it takes a while to learn a language&#x27;s API, but essentially all of them do similar things.  The advantages lies not in them alone, but in the entire framework/suite that it comes with. \nWe are living in times where knowing programming languages is not as important as knowing frameworks/libraries.  There are heaps of them out there that require programmer to spend more time on writing integration code to &quot;glue them&quot; or configuring them.  We no longer need to write the low-level mundane code, but focus on delivering high-quality, rich software applications.",1438236095

We go there and back, to where we started. There’s no escape, nothing will ever change and nobody will ever break out of this well-­ordered world.”<p>I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s fascist. Tolkien books are basicaly Catholic mythology in different clothes. It&#x27;s very conservative, &quot;reactionary&quot;, and old-fashioned, true. But fascist philosophy was all about superhumans making their own laws and morality. Doesn&#x27;t exactly go well with conservatism.<p>Also - after reading Moorcock books (runestaff cycle mostly) I don&#x27;t think they were qualitatively different from other fantasy. I remember it as just regular pulp fantasy to be honest. Maybe I should reread it, last time I&#x27;ve read it I was a teenager.",1438236089

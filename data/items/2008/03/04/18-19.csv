Someone in the comments of pchristensen's blog recommended the book 'Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation'. I flicked through the first few chapters and for what it's worth it seems pretty good. Also 'Successful Lisp' is pretty good too.<p>Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation:\n<a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/</a><p>Successful Lisp:\n<a href=""http://psg.com/~dlamkins/Site/sl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psg.com/~dlamkins/Site/sl.html</a>",1204657113

Yet, at the same time, money is resting in the savings account of companies to protect them from the recession. These two approaches to dealing with the economy on behalf of the government and companies seem to contradict each other.<p>Also, isn’t the company’s goal to maximize shareholders’ return on their investments? Of course, one can make a case for storing cash to increase long-term returns, but if the company is retaining the cash for its sake, let the shareholders have it. I’d rather have the companies I invest in make me money; otherwise, I have a savings account on my own.",1204656519

129019,comment,128447,128908,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I think your assertion that ""you can't have it all"" is telling. We are raised in the US being told that we can indeed have it all, if we work hard enough.<p>I'm not arguing that this is reality, I'm just saying our attitude is such that anything is achievable. Maybe that makes us naive, but it also makes us much more likely to take a big risk for a big payoff.<p>I confess I don't know France well enough to add to your views on it's economic attitudes, but I do know the US well enough to say what I just said. I think the point of the article is that since we are not taught to fear capitalism, we are more likely to do stupid things that sometimes actually pay off, and the pay off is generally worth it for society, if not for the individuals that failed en route.<p>And I think France was the #1 power in the world briefly... the Napoleonic Era. Either way, it has been one of the top powers for quite a while. I, as an American, am still envious of your prowess in Nuclear Energy.",1204655983

129014,comment,128872,128872,0,0,jdavid,,,"So we have been doing some exploring after another investor in the midwest told us to just move to the valley for the networking alone.  he may be right.<p>after a few visits, i can say that living in SF, and playing in SF is just fine without a car.  SF will be expensive like living in the loop in Chicago, or in some parts of Manhattan, heck thats what you pay for being in the center of it.  If you are coming from the suburbs you are in for a shock if you move to SF.<p>if you live out of SF, you will want a car/ or even better a moped or bike.  public transportation is nice, but it adds up and is time consuming waiting for stuff.  what i love about it is it runs late, so a night out can be had without driving into SF.<p>right now in MKE i am paying $770 a month as part of a 2 bedroom that is $1540 a month.  For that we have 2 bedrooms, 1800sqft, a backyard, and a garage.  In the valley i expect to have much less, but it still seems like i can get a 2 bedroom for ~1500-~1800 a month, or a 3 bedroom for 2100-3000 a month.  i think rent is actually fairly reasonable considering the average median incomes and the number of people with degrees.<p>starbucks internet will cost you $40 a month, where in MKE i get cafe wifi all over the city for $22 a month.  i might have to give in and get Att uverse internet in the valley so we can roam into a starbucks for free.<p>As far as food goes, i found that palo alto, and just outside of san jose are craazy expensive.  in MKE a quiznos sandwich and drink might cost you 8$ but in that area, we paid $12-$13  50% more.  I found food in SF cheaper.  I do not know about the grocery stores, but its pretty hard to meet people for lunch and or coffee in your home, so I think Food may have its larges sticker shock.<p>as for location, we found that 90% of the events that we want to go to are in the sunnyvale, palo alto, and north/west san jose area.  so it makes more sense for us to live there, well unless we are going to date......  there seems to be a lot of lovely ladies in Downtown SF on a daily basis, in fact most of them will smile back.  It's kinda rare for a city to have that quality.  So I would rank SF very high on women being approachable there.<p>Our plan for our 4 guys (1 of which is married) is to get a 2 bedroom with a great couch for the 3rd guy, and a when the married guy is in town, he can have a hidden mattress or an inflatable one.  When it makes sense, we will get 1 more apartment come fall 08 or something.",1204655505

You guys have been constantly tweaking and tuning the site, and listening to suggestions, and it's looking great now.<p>That said, the infinite scroll thing drives me a little nutty. Since I'm usually stealing time away from something to screw around on a news site somewhere online, I try to say to myself, ""I'll just read 2 pages"", or ""I'll just scan the first page, I only have a couple of minutes"". But, I can't do that on Jaanix. On the other hand, I think it's a cool feature, and I get why you want to use it.<p>Is there an on/off switch for it in user settings maybe?

Now Pylons is settling down and maturing, it will probably start to become much more widely used and appreciated. Also, Pylons may benefit from Django's recent boost in a similar way the link suggests Django is benefiting from Rails.",1204655286

I know it's irrational because 1) who cares about one kid? and 2) most sites have an option to make pics private.  I'm just a little nervous about not being able to put the genie back in the bottle.  Unexpected consequences are unexpected.<p>I email some pics and snail mail CD-ROMs to interested family.

(Say, $300 a month.) I like to eat out more often and spend $600-$700 on food each month for me and my girlfriend. We don't go out drinking very often, but when we do, it's easily $100 a night for several drinks, pizza, and a cab ride home.<p>I don't own a car, but when I did it was $150/month for a spot in a garage and $40 for parking tickets. Public transportation is great and the city has a strong bicycle advocacy group, so that's what I choose.<p>I highly recommend living in the city if you aren't bothered by crowds, and there are plenty of software companies here.

I am a unexperienced coder, I have a tad more than an year on software development field as a professional. I noticed that people that are far more experienced than I am are quite resistant to change or to try anything new. Not many months ago I had a discussion with my manager about being allowed to use .NET 3.5 because the company was still using .NET 1.1 due to the fact that ""the company"" did not have enough time to analyze how .NET 2.0 ""worked"" and couldn't understand the impact of the change, much less .NET 2.5. I would still be developping in .NET 1.1 wasn't for the WCF that comes as part of .NET 3.5 and would cut a lot of development time because the company decided to make the software using SOA. Is it always like this? Why is it that the ones that could learn quicker due to their greater experience are the ones less willing to learn?",1204653781

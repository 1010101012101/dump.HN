Five of us worked our ass off for 4 months to come up with a machine that would assemble parts of a biomedical device. At the end our system worked great, and it clearly would have saved the company tens of thousands of dollars a year in wasted product. Everyone at the company was very excited about it, and they planned to use it on the actual factory floor.<p>It was going to take 2.5 years for the FDA to approve it. In the meantime, it sat on a shelf waiting and waiting and waiting.<p>With timelines like that, nobody can accomplish anything without billions and billions of dollars.",1316807994

Compare the rules on shooting unarmed burglars in California vs. Texas, for example.<p>The only reasonable way to read the article is to understand that ""illegal"" is shorthand for  ""Illegal in my jurisdiction, and in jurisdictions with enough power to get local law enforcement to turn the screws on me.""   It is simply impossible to follow all laws written by all countries;  what is prohibited by one country may be mandatory in another.<p>No ISP in America is going to care if you post what would be protected speech in America from China where it may be illegal.  From the point of view of the American courts, breaking that Chinese law is actually a public service; Here, the right to say bad things about our government is protected by our highest laws.<p>So yeah, I see no contradiction.  The company is trying to obey laws that apply to them, and allowing customers to break laws that are outside of their jurisdiction.",1316807894

Not to mention, NASA's most memorable achievements were fueled largely through patriotic furor.<p>I suspect that it's possible. Much of NASA's flouted benefit are the technological discoveries it has made while solving the problems of Space exploration. Assuming that those discoveries have benefited our society economically more than NASA has cost it (an argument I've read before) then it seems like their would have been at least one sufficient financial incentive for private industry to pursue space if given the chance. Not to mention R&D that can only be performed in a zero gravity environment. A patent system <i>could</i> make all this profitable.<p>But there are still so many other concerns, such as national defense that crop up in talk of private space exploration that it's really hard to make any real comparison.",1316807799

It's good that you seem to be aware of this barrier.<p>Potential users didn't understand the registration process at all when I told them to send an email to register. From talking to some of them later, many figured the sign-up email address was one that I was reading & acting on manually. Perhaps in the years since, average people are more at ease with the idea that a computer can just as easily process email as it can a web form. The lesson I learned is that there are some places where it's better to be conventional than clever, and on-boarding users is one of them.<p>Congrats on launching, and good luck.",1316807566

I was thinking about starting work on a web app that enables you to easily create an approval workflow. Say for example you have a document, and are a college student who wants a few people to review your essay. With this app, you would create a workflow, where people A,B,C and D receive your doc in an email. All they have to reply to it with update versions and you get it back. This is the simplest use case.<p>Here's a more complex use case. You have a new banner you want to use, but you need to get it approved by the three people in the QA team for feedback, then sent to the designer again (to implement changes), and then back to you. After you approve it again, it gets sent to the CTO, then CEO. After the CEO approves, you get a notification with any feedback they may have left.<p>Initially it would be a one way flow (which might be an issue for a lot of users), so if you want, you can restart the process. The aim is to keep it simple. No sign up necessary for anyone except the initiator. Just reply to the email. The initiator can also see the current status of the documents. I can think of 100s of feature I can add, but that for another time.

Lulzsec have been ALLEGEDLY been responsible for a number of high profile cases such as:<p>The hacking of the Sony Playstation network which compromised the names, passwords, e-mail addresses, home addresses and dates of birth of thousands of people.\nThe DDOS attack which knocked the British governments SOCA (Serious Organised Crime Agency) and other government websites offline.\nThe release of various sensitive and confidential information from companies such as AT&T, Viacom, Disney, EMI, NBC Universal, and AOL.\nGaining access to NATO servers and releasing documents regarding the communication and information services (CIS) in Kosovo.\nThe defacement of British newspaper websites The Sun & The Times.\nThe hacking of 77 law enforcement sheriff websites.<p>It first came to our attention when leaked IRC chat logs were released, in these logs participants discussed about various VPN services they use, and it became apparent that some members were using our service. No action was taken, after all there was no evidence to suggest wrongdoing and nothing to identify which accounts with us they were using. At a later date it came as no surprise to have received a court order asking for information relating to an account associated with some or all of the above cases. As stated in our terms of service and privacy policy our service is not to be used for illegal activity, and as a legitimate company we will cooperate with law enforcement if we receive a court order (equivalent of a subpoena in the US).<p>Our VPN service and VPN services in general are not designed to be used to commit illegal activity. It is very naive to think that by paying a subscription fee to a VPN service you are free to break the law without any consequences. This includes certain hardcore privacy services which claim you will never be identified, these types of services that do not cooperate are more likely to have their entire VPN network monitored and tapped by law enforcement, thus affecting all legitimate customers.<p>We would also like to clear up some misconceptions about what we do and what we stand for. In 2005 we setup HMA primarily as a way to bypass censorship of the world-wide-web whether this be on a government or a corporate/localized scale. We truly believe the world-wide-web should be world-wide and not censored in anyway. A prime example of this would be the Egyptian revolution for which our service played a key role for protesters gaining access to websites such as Twitter which were blocked by the government, we experienced record traffic during this time. Although our web proxy accounts to a high percentage of our traffic, our VPN service accounts to nearly all of our revenue. Our main customer base use our VPN service to ensure their sensitive web traffic cannot be intercepted on insecure networks, though there are many other legitimate uses such as the ability to unblock GEO-restricted websites. Rummage through our review database and youll be able to gain a decent understanding of who uses our service and why.\nEdit: We have had a few queries as to our logging policies. We only log the time you connect and disconnect from our service, we do not log in any shape or form your actual internet traffic.",1316806545

This is really only important because (a) long-polling and Comet can easily cross proxies and (b) WebSockets aren't HTTP. It's <i>less code</i> to write a non-HTTP WebSockets server than to bolt one onto an existing HTTP server.<p>WebSockets security is non-existent.

Which is why you don't have too look very hard to find high cost solutions with terrible interfaces for physicians but decent interfaces for IT administrators.<p>Medical devices have mostly been vetted by physicians and provided to the IT department who tries to discern what works well in their current network.

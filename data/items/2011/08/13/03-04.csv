2880188,comment,2879972,2879972,3,0,Jach,,,"My first piece of advice is to ignore what everyone tells you and find a path you're comfortable with. :) What's been hard for me is deciding when to explore and when to exploit. With a full time programming job that's mainly applying my knowledge, not doing real research, I have much less time to explore, but back in high school and the summers in between I had lots of free time to learn a little of this and that and play around a lot. I started with a PHP+MySQL book and for the first couple of months or so just plowed through it, typing in the examples manually or doing my own variations of the topics. When I learned about the ""ternary operator"" I made a web page that just printed out alternating rows of color.<p>My second piece of advice is to find a problem, ideally a bunch of problems, that you want to solve and that programming can help you solve. Solve them. Definition of problem: something to solve. ;P e.g. a program that prints the Bottles of Beer lyrics out, increase the start number until you can crash/slow down your computer or server, build a blog website, image gallery, video game with PyGame, or in text, native QT app calculator, project Euler math problems, robots, whatever. The key is you have to have a desire to work on whatever you're working on. When you lose that desire for your current project, procrastinate by switching to a different project.<p>My third piece of advice is to learn how to use the git source control manager and interfacing with GitHub. Then troll some Python repositories ( <a href=""https://github.com/search?type=Repositories&language=&q=language%3Apython&repo=&langOverride=&x=0&y=0&start_value=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/search?type=Repositories&language=&#3...</a> ), find some with an open issues list and an issue that isn't assigned to a particular person, fix the issue if you want/can, and submit a pull request. Now you can say you've contributed to open source software!<p>Edit: if you really have no ideas of your own, which I'd find hard to believe, you can do a small project I've been meaning to get around to for a while so I can blog about it. (I blog mostly to my past self.) Implement a clone of the game Pong three times in an imperative, Object-Oriented, and functional style of programming.",1313207876

I really do think that the American public is both apathetic and ignorant, and the majority of the country's current problems derive from these failings.<p>They are apathetic, but they are not apathetic towards any specific issue. No, they are apathetic to anything that would seem to distract them from the normal course of their daily schedule. I do not think that it would be difficult for ""ordinary"" people to take a few minutes and become informed about what is going on. If I know, you know, and (probably) most of the people on Hacker News know - well, it can't be impossible to find out.<p>I think that, well, most people content themselves that party affiliation and straight-ticket voting are all that is necessary to ensure a functioning democracy. It just seems strange to me, that in  a country where so many people pride themselves on being patriotic, there is so little intellectual curiosity with regards to how it functions.<p>The tyranny of the majority is usually used to refer to the potential for the opinion of the many to disenfranchise the rights of the few. I wonder if there is something more insidious than this though. What could be the side effects of the self-selected nonchalance of the many?<p>I was once told that to talk about a problem without providing a solution is not a good way to advance in society, but, really, I'm completely at a loss.

2880162,comment,2879819,2880143,-1,0,cookiecaper,,,"""ignorant"" and ""ignoring"" are different forms of the same word (""ignore""). One describes a person that regularly ignores something (""ignorant"") and the other describes the act of ignore (""ignoring""). So, to say that people aren't ignoring the issue, they're just ignorant, is the same thing.<p>Perhaps you mean that people aren't <i>aware</i> of the issue. This is closely related to being ignorant, as one who is paying attention (i.e., not ignoring things) will realize the problem fairly early, but not quite the same. Well, people aren't aware because they choose to ignore important matters for trivial distraction.<p>When it boils down to it, the blame for any long-standing regime can only be placed on the populous that lives under its control. Kings and sovereigns cannot govern without at least the implicit consent of obedience from their subjects. We can make excuses but it isn't going to get us anywhere. We need to become serious about the issues in our government and <i>move to correct them</i>, with the knowledge that people do not sacrifice the tokens of earthly prominence easily.",1313206471
2880161,comment,363,363,8,0,tzs,,,"Please, if it wouldn't be much work, change the mechanism for coloring down voted comments to be via the stylesheet instead of via font tags with color attributes?<p>Also, there is an oddity in the way comments are organized. They go like this:<p><pre><code>   font tag that sets the comment color\n     ""first paragraph text NOT in a p tag""\n     p tag\n        ""second paragraph text""\n     p tag\n        ""third paragraph text""\n    ...\n     p tag\n       font tag that sets the comment color\n         ""final paragraph text""\n</code></pre>\n(Not using actual tags to avoid any quoting problems, and closing tags omitted). This leads to amusing results--for instance if you use a user stylesheet to try to set comment colors, by coloring all the paragraphs under the comment span, it only actually colors the middle paragraphs. The first and last paragraph of each comment are not affected.<p>If there is no specific reason for this odd layout, fixing it would make the site a little more friendly for those who want to tweak it with user stylesheets.

2880158,comment,2879546,2879618,2,0,bdb,,,"Pure speculation on my part, but given the limited suitable equipment space available in each BART station, it's likely that BART has deployed a neutral host (i.e., BART-owned, not carrier-owned) distributed antenna system[1] throughout their stations. In that case, it's easy for them to cut power to the actual RF gear without carrier intervention (and without having to worry about those pesky strings of 48V batteries keeping things running.)<p>The bigger issue to me is that is almost certainly illegal to willfully disrupt 911 service, and it's unlikely that whoever flipped whatever switch, be it disrupting commercial power to carrier-owned base stations or a BART-owned DAS, was able to disrupt texts/voice calls to other parties selectively without disrupting 911 service.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infinigy.com/PDF/InfinigyNeutralHostWhitepaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infinigy.com/PDF/InfinigyNeutralHostWhitepaper.pd...</a>",1313206276

2880154,comment,2879482,2879856,10,0,jrockway,,,"<i>what does that say about the hardness of making software resilient to attack</i><p>Well, we already know the answer to that question.  The long-term solution is to build software out of safer building blocks.  A good example is high-level programming languages.  When you write C and use cstrings (or other unstructured ""blocks-o-ram"" data structures), you have to ""get it right"" every single time you touch a string.  In a codebase the size of Flash's, this probably amounts to tens of thousands of possible bugs.  But if you write it in a high-level language, the runtime implementor only has to get it right once -- and there's no way you can get it wrong, even if you want to.  (The middle ground is something like better string handling functions; OpenBSD tried to do this with strl*, and there are libraries like bstrings that represent strings properly.  But you can still do unsafe pointer math on these strings with not-much-benefit.)<p>The way it stands right now, it's cheaper to write software with the approach of ""throw some trained monkeys at it and hope for the best"".  But in the future, we're going to need to do a lot more thinking and a lot less typing if we want to write secure software without performance penalties.",1313206066

I much prefer whole array or list operations with no fiddling with indices and off by one errors. I like Haskell's array API, for example. You can index by whatever is natural in each case and you can always get the whole list of valid indices for an array x by using ""indices x"". I think that's much nicer, and it's also what D is doing: instead of having a(n implicitly paired) starting and ending iterator to indicate a range of positions like the C++ library does, D's library uses a range object. Basically I'm saying you can represent a range of indices as a pair of indices, one pointing to the first valid position and the other pointing past the last valid one, but that's an implementation detail you don't need to expose, make a range abstraction and you'll be happier.<p>I should also point out that mathematicians don't number at zero unless there is some advantage (the default is to start at one), but more importantly, the preferred style in mathematical arguments is to avoiding fiddling with indices as much as possible (since it's so easy to mess something up working at such a low level of abstraction).",1313205091

But those are different from central planning. In the 50s, when a vertically integrated GM or Ford controlled 3% of GDP, that was as close to central planning as we got. But back then, interestingly, wealth and incomes were less concentrated than today. The link between concentration of wealth and the form of industrial organization is not very clear.",1313205053

If you are a reasonably competent programmer, you will find work in the Valley. There are dozens of large companies and there are literally hundreds of startups.<p>If you are really serious, take a 1 week vacation. Hang out in Mountain View, Palo Alto and San Fran. Attend a tech meetup every night and <i>talk</i> to people. You will find a job.

If he couldn&#x27;t get those, he didn&#x27;t want a personalized plate, so he put NO PLATE. Of course, he ended up with NO PLATE. Since that&#x27;s what the police put as the license if a car doesn&#x27;t have a plate, he ended up with 2500 tickets. Eventually the DMV told the police to write &quot;NONE&quot; instead of &quot;NO PLATE&quot; and said &quot;We&#x27;re just hoping that no one will come up with plates that say NONE.&quot; (Which would be ironic if the parent comment is accurate.)<p>The article is pretty entertaining - it talks about him becoming semi-famous and getting pulled over because cops wanted their picture taken with him:

People are used to that and want to invest in profit-makers. Both sides benefit.<p>One thing I can highly recommend is giving your clients &quot;good, better, best&quot; estimates. For example tell them, &quot;I can fix it with duct tape for $, I can keep this from happening again for $$, and I can hook up this cool new solution called X for $$$.&quot; You might be surprised how many clients will go straight for the top. The clients who always stick around the bottom will become more obvious about it, and you&#x27;ll learn to work with them more effectively, too.",1375372055

Maybe, but that really depends on what your context is. What&#x27;s important is the mindset of the tester and how you can bake that into the engineering culture that it&#x27;s in.<p>Second, speed. Agile isn&#x27;t about speed. Agile is about people and how the people interact with each other to produce better &quot;things&quot;. I think one of the places where bugs are introduced in any development cycle and that&#x27;s when the developers write code. The faster your &quot;speed&quot; is, the faster you introduce &quot;bugs&quot;. The ability to test &quot;fast&quot; is nice but you have to test intelligently to get the most bang for your buck and you need a human for that.<p>Third, Manual testing was referred to as the &quot;lowest form of life on the dev cycle&quot; is not a reflection on the tester but how bad the organization&#x27;s hiring methods, and engineering processes are. How you employ a tool or a person does not define and limit what testing is for. cum hoc ergo propter hoc.<p>Not to take away from Jason&#x27;s accomplishments in the test automation tool space and what he&#x27;s done to revolutionize and simplify certain tasks that would have been really tedious and even annoying to perform over and over again.

6141088,comment,6136817,6136817,3,0,talmand,,,"I once worked for a company that operated along these lines. It wasn&#x27;t quite as bad as those mentioned in the article due to the fact that the industry in question had several government agencies watching almost everything they do but it was an interesting learning experience.<p>There&#x27;s likely two reasons why so many follow the same pattern. It&#x27;s possible that many did enough A/B testing to determine the best direction that provided the best results. More likely one person came up with the pattern, the rest decided that it seemed a successive effort, and they all copied that one person&#x27;s pattern.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I created a landing page and/or email that was built in one specific way that originated with one guy that the rest perceived as the most successive guy in their type of marketing. If he said it, then it was gold. It was a tad disheartening as there was no real design involved. &quot;Copy is king!&quot; was the mantra and a nice design was not necessary. Even a decent design that made the copy easier to read was not considered worth the time. This was typically the type of landing page that uses the funnel method of long, sensational text with call-to-actions sprinkled down the page leading to a short order form at the bottom.<p>This insistence of copying everybody else because of perceived success, no data to support that perception of course, made for interesting conversations. &quot;We&#x27;re doing it this way.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because that&#x27;s how they did it.&quot; &quot;Why should we do it because they did?&quot; &quot;If they&#x27;re doing it then it must work.&quot;<p>Although it was always fun to introduce a new kink to the marketing pattern and watch everybody else copy you. Especially when we hadn&#x27;t yet decided if the new method even worked or not.<p>My favorite story that shows how locked into a pattern they would be until something shattered their illusions involved one sales email. For the longest time it was the rule to use as few images as possible in emails. The reasoning being because modern email clients do not automatically download images so you don&#x27;t want things hidden from the potential customer before they interact with the email. I fought that quite a bit using legit companies like Apple and NewEgg as examples in that they successfully sell stuff and use images quite frequently through their emails. No dice. So one day I design a new email template that did use images heavily, our products were displayed in a grid that looked like stickers placed on the email. That meant that the copy listing details and pricing of the products were in the images, which was a no-no. I didn&#x27;t tell anyone I did this knowing that all of them had their email clients downloading images automatically that came from us. The email was approved and sent out. A few weeks later I asked how that email did, &quot;Best money-making email we&#x27;ve ever sent out!&quot;<p>I then confessed to what I had done to their totally shocked confusion. After that I was able to actually design stuff that looked nice instead of the scammy look they insisted upon. And of course most of those newer designs, not all mind you, made more money. Interesting that I didn&#x27;t see many other companies copying the new pattern. I guess it broke the mold enough to not be perceived as successful.<p>Anyway, even with the occasional moral problems, it was a good learning experience. Almost everything I know about SEO, ads, email, marketing, analytics, customer relations, and much more came from this company. Kind of gives me a somewhat unique perspective at my new job at a more traditional agency.",1375371945

My problem though, it&#x27;s difficult to sit in a comfortable position. When your desk and chair are at the proper height, the screen is far too low. On my ultrabook, to line up with my eyes, the top of the screen needs to be another 15in higher. I end up having to hunch over and constantly look down to compensate. It seems like it would make sense to have a screen that can be raised up, and even forward, to give the illusion of a larger screen at the same time. Why are we not seeing these on the market? Anyone else have this problem or have any creative solutions?<p>I did a quick search and noticed some patents, and this laptop called the flybook that was released 7 years ago. It has a pivot on the base, and one where it connects to the display, so you can bring it forward at the same time while being able to properly adjust the angle. If I pickup my laptop and bring in it 7 or 8 inches closer, and the same length higher, it feels much more comfortable. Maybe it is a patent issue, but it seems like the major hardware manufacturers would work around it one way or another.<p>Flybook, 2006 - http://i.imgur.com/3nzQ1ZV.jpg",1375371649

First, the comparisons are often brought up in response to those claiming - directly or indirectly - that terrorism is an existential threat to America.  The fact that we live with things that kill vastly more people puts the lie to that.<p>Second, the issue is the <i>marginal</i> expenditure to <i>marginal</i> deaths.  We spend tremendous effort and some freedom reducing auto accidents, <i>and we reduce them substantially</i>.  We don&#x27;t spend trillions <i>more</i> at this point, because we don&#x27;t consider it worthwhile.  Before 9/11, we had some level of expenditure (of effort, money, freedom) on preventing terrorism, and doubtless saw some reduction in terrorism over what it would have otherwise been, and had it down to some particular level.  Since 9/11, we&#x27;ve been spending that <i>plus</i> trillions of dollars and more of our freedoms, and the most we can <i>possibly</i> do is reduce terrorism to zero - and even if the alternative were a significant increase in terrorism (something like 9/11 every other day, instead of - generously - once every several years) there would still be more room to save lives in these other ways.<p>Finally, 9/11 had an enormous cost, but a lot of the psychological cost is due to fear mongering from people who lack the perspective the numbers bring.  Another large portion of that cost is due to lack of resiliency in the companies with offices in the WTC, and companies doing business with those companies, &c.  The former is addressed through education and leadership, the latter by encouraging behaviors that will also help in the case of (say) a massive hurricane.  None of this is served by a panicked focus on terrorism.",1375371631

First marriages fail about 50% of the time, while second marriages fail in the 70% range.  Therefore, people are, on average, worse at their second and subsequent marriages than their first.  It is rather irritating to contemplate, but the average person <i>does not</i> get better at staying married with practice, at least for &quot;practicing&quot; marriages with different people.<p>My point was that there exist skills (or goal oriented behavior, here the presumed goal being to stay married) that do not necessarily improve with &quot;practice.&quot;  Nothing else comes to mind, but I would be interested in other things that break the common notion of always getting better with &quot;practice.&quot;  Human beings are very complicated, and I can imagine other situations where practice does not make perfect.<p>I remember reading some research about divorced people where many reported that they had underestimated the emotional devastation that they felt after the divorce, and that if they had known how hard it would be, they would have tried much harder to rebuild their marriage.<p>As another off topic comment about how complicated people are, in marketing it is important to let people know that what you are selling is easy and quick and convenient and ...  Except for one area, where it is critical to tell people how hard it will be and how much work they will have to do if they buy your product.  And that field is body building.

6140936,comment,6139509,6140141,1,0,javajosh,,,"And yet diagramming remains a useful communication technique. Why? Because diagraming recapitulates one of the most fundamental of programming activities: describing the addressability of data. When you draw a box, you are saying &quot;This is worth addressing, this is how big it is and I&#x27;ll even try to impart it&#x27;s qualities with shape, color, and a label.&quot; The stage is set, and now you can describe how the actors interact with each other. And that&#x27;s useful.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, though, that diagrams seem to only really be useful for humans. Maybe that&#x27;s another form of Turing test: hand a program a high-level diagram and see if the computer can write a program that behaves as the diagram describes. Perhaps this would even be an iterative process, with the computer doing what it&#x27;s sure about, e.g. defining a type, and then prompting for more input (possibly in the form of a diagram!) when it&#x27;s unclear. I suppose a way to approach this would first have a known-good solution, like Word-Press, do the diagrams for it, then feed the diagrams into this hypothetical software-writing program and see how much help it needs to recover something like the original WordPress.<p>There&#x27;s even another interesting question, which is what impact the programming paradigm has on diagram descriptions of software. You would see differences at both the framework and the language level: a SpringMVC diagram is different than Play, which is different than Rails, which is very different from Noir. And Clojure programs would, generally, tend to be diagrammed very differently from Java or Groovy programs.",1375370825

6140905,comment,6138011,6138011,2,0,artagnon,,,"My takeaway from this presentation:<p>- To achieve instruction-level parallelism, traditional architectures (his example: Haswell) often employ very messy techniques like register renaming which create a huge amount of complexity increasing power-consumption.<p>- He has focused on one such technique called Very Long instruction word (VLIW), and has taken it to an extreme: the technique he proposes is to throw away general purpose registers, and replace it with a &quot;belt&quot;: a write-once linear tape of memory (implemented using stacks).<p>- He then points out various advantages of this model, including in-order execution (ILP traditionally requires reordering), short pipeline, and overall simplification of architectures.<p>All this looks fine on paper, but I don&#x27;t see a proposed instruction set, or any indication of what realization of this model will require. In short, it&#x27;s a cute theoretical exercise.<p>So, let&#x27;s look at what the unworkable <i>problems</i> with Haswell are, and what&#x27;s being done to fix them. Yes, nobody can seem to be able to figure out how to reduce power consumption on performant x86 microarchitectures beyond a point. It&#x27;s a very old architecture, and I&#x27;m hopeful about the rise of ARM. The solution is not to throw away general purpose registers, but rather to cut register renaming and make ILP easier to implement by using a weak memory model (which is exactly what ARM does). ARM64 is emerging and the successes of x86 are slowly percolating to it [1]. Moreover, the arch/arm64 tree in linux.git is 1.5 years old and is under active development; we even got virt/kvm/arm merged in recently (3 months ago), although I&#x27;m not sure how it works without processor extensions (it&#x27;s not pure pvops). ARM32 already rules embedded and mobile devices, and manufacturers are interested in taking it to heavy computing. In short, the roadmap is quite clear: ARM64 is the future.<p>The core of the Linux memory barriers model described in Documentation/memory-barriers.txt [2] (heavily inspired by the relaxed DEC Alpha) should tell you what you need to know about why a weak memory model is desirable.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.arm.com/files/downloads/ARMv8_Architecture.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arm.com/files/downloads/ARMv8_Architecture.pdf</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/...</a>",1375370578

I mean, if you do not agree with everything that the &#x27;progressive left&#x27; stand for, you may feel quite good in Russia.<p>Putin&#x27;s government is supporting the church, and promoting traditional family values. They have instituted significant money benefits for families with children, and as a result the much talked about decline in Russia&#x27;s population has been stopped in 2013. For the first time in modern Russian history there are more babies born in Russia than people die of old age. <a href=""http://www.amren.com/news/2013/06/russias-population-decline-said-to-have-stopped/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amren.com/news/2013/06/russias-population-decline...</a><p>The laws prohibiting &quot;gay propaganda&quot; should be viewed in the context of these policies. Obviously, being gay as such is not illegal in Russia. There are gay bars in any large Russian city, and quite a few of celebrities have admitted to be gay. However, they have made it illegal to promote homosexuality publicly.<p>Then, there are economic policies of Putin that would make Reagan jealous. Russian government has adopted a flat 13% tax rate on all incomes in 2001. Not only this has made Russia one of the lowest tax jurisdictions in the world. Most importantly, the flat rate has removed thousands of &#x27;tax exceptions&#x27; that is the source of economic inefficiencies and outright corruption in most of &#x27;developed&#x27; countries. Here is a noted US conservative lamenting that Putin has achieved something he had worked on most of his life. <i></i>&quot;We won the Cold War, but Russia gets a flat tax while America is stuck with a Byzantine tax system based on class-warfare ideology.&quot;<i></i>
<a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2003/03/russias-flat-tax-miracle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2003/03/russias-...</a>.<p>Finally, the &#x27;freedom of press opression&#x27; and &#x27;political persecution of opponents&#x27; thesis is in many ways overblown. Most popular Russian internet media outlets are openly anti-Putin (lenta.ru, slon.ru etc. etc.). The most listened to news/talk-show radio station (Echo Moskvy) is strongly anti-Putin, and a very popular cable TV channel (Dozhd) is also anti-Putin and anti-establishment.<p>And the trial of the poster-child of anti-Putin opposition Mr Khodorkovsky (who was imprisoned years ago on fraud and tax-evasion charges) has just been recognised as a &#x27;non-political&#x27; by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) (read: Khodorkovsky was indeed a crook, and his sentencing was not influenced by his anti-Putin stance). <a href=""http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-european-court-khodorkovsky/25056475.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-european-court-khodorkov...</a><p>Putin&#x27;s government is also following Western conservative script with regard to intellectual property. Actually, today the have effected a broad-reaching anti-piracy law that would outlaw any internet site that publishes links to illegal movie download or torrent-trackers. To Putin&#x27;s credit, the downloaders of illegal content themselves will not be prosecuted. So, parents of teenagers need not worry about gigantic fines etc.<p>Obviously, Putin is no friend to US conservatives, primarily because Putin is a nationalist and conducts an independent foreign policy. What is good for Russia need not be good for the US. And vice versa. But Putin may be good for those Russians that hold traditional conservative values. Hell, such people may feel Russia is the last bastion of true conservatism left in the world, while not being exactly a Pinochet-like fascist place.",1375370451

On the other side there are things that might be more dangerous (like obesity which kills way more people than terrorism) but evolutionary these are relatively new and we have yet to develop the &#x27;sense of danger&#x27; to them.

JS has got to be one of the least intuitive, cobbled together languages I&#x27;ve ever had to work with. In what other language are people still having holy wars over how to separate statements?<p>Why the heck would a constructor be a regular function if calling it without new pollutes the global namespace? JS gives us prototypes so that we can have inheritance! Great, but that doesn&#x27;t actually give us a simple ability to call super. Using functions as everything is fine and good, until you have to shoehorn all the functionality you actually need into mysterious constructs like prototype, new, and apply. When the symmetries are so half-assed, at some point, it seems to me to make way more since to stop overloading the same language construct and make separate constructs for separate uses.<p>And don&#x27;t even get me started on implicit variable declaration, function hoisting, the double-equals, for...in, the necessity of self-calling functions, etc.<p>Thank God we have libraries and alternative syntaxes now that more or less smooth over these issues and coerce the programmer into writing reasonable JS code, because green field JS is a complete quagmire.

I guess I&#x27;m not convinced that the rest of the job losses were due to economic pessimism and fear in the financial markets. I was assuming it included the bodega guy, the guy working for the bodega guy, couriers, tailors, every other small business owner in the area, people servicing those small business owners, the carpet cleaners, window washers, the outsourced IT guys, people servicing the physical infrastructure of the area, people who worked in the other buildings. etc. I could be totally off base, but  blasting out part of the infrastructure of a city of 19M people seems like it could cause a relatively &quot;direct&quot; 2% job loss over 3 months.",1375369227

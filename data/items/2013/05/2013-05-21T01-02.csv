They were certainly a better prospect than old school card payments where you had to apply for multiple services, make back room deals to get good fees, and all that nonsense. However, to start the application process with Braintree, it seemed you would still be faced with a lot of form-filling, followed by multi-week delays to get approval (or not), and on top of that the fees were unclear but didn't look competitive in most cases.<p>More recently, the likes of GoCardless and Stripe have become serious players on the UK scene, and both seem to be working on expansions further into Europe as well. They have all the same obvious benefits that Braintree offered: a single company to deal with, staffed by human beings rather than robots, reasonable APIs. But they also offer much faster sign-up and reasonable, transparent fees.<p>At this point, to be brutally honest, the likes of Braintree are simply outclassed. Unless anything very surprising happens, I expect the payments market for UK and probably European small businesses and start-ups to be completely dominated by GoCardless and Stripe within 2-3 years. Unless you're big enough to approach the old school players with enough leverage to get favourable terms, it's hard to see why you'd look any further if these are options, and I think both GoCardless and Stripe will do well because they're different enough not to be in direct competition but similar enough to keep each other honest.",1369100419

There is a reason you don't see many software companies setting up shop in Des Monies and trying to attract engineers with the low cost of living.<p>>Facebook could move its place of incorporation to Delaware overnight, but the place where it 'adds value' is rooted in California.<p>That's what I'm saying. You should tax the things that ""add value"" (employees, real estate that implies use of local infrastructure, etc.) rather than trying to tax profit, because profit doesn't have a country.<p>The problem with the alternative is that just because your country contains something that ""adds value"" doesn't mean a corporate entity in your country can make any profit from it. Suppose your country has great engineers. If the engineers are the valuable commodity and the market is efficient then they'll get paid close to the value they provide to the company and leave little as profit for the corporation. You can have a company which is providing <i>huge</i> value to the economy but is having to pay its employees the lion's share of that revenue in order to retain them. That company won't have very high profit margins because if it kept more of the profits for itself its engineers would quit and join a competitor that pays better.<p>The only way that doesn't happen is if the company has something its competitors don't (strong trademarks, trade secrets, some unusually valuable copyrights or patents, etc.) But then the value of that non-geographically-dependent asset (which is all that keeps the company from having razor thin margins) can be whisked off to an entity in a low tax jurisdiction, leaving the entity within the higher tax jurisdiction in the position of having extremely small margins again while the profits accumulate in the entity associated with the movable asset.<p>>Regarding the widget manufacturer: Yes, in some cases a transfer profit of 20% will be sufficient to wipe out all reported profit in the high-tax jurisdiction. But how common would that be?<p>You're asking how common it is for a company to have a less than 10% profit margin? I would say that covers most companies. The primary exceptions (which Apples clearly falls into) are the companies that sell products covered by high value copyrights, patents, trademarks, etc. Which leads to what we've been discussing with software licenses.<p>The problem simply is that you can't have significantly higher taxes than the next country on anything that can be easily removed from your jurisdiction, or that is exactly what will happen. And the profits of international corporations fall into that category.",1369100232

At least one of them is a port of the Dalvik bits from AOSP, so, inherently, compatibility is really very good. On top of that, one can even blend the Tizen ""Home"" and task switching with the Android back-stack and task management. That's tricky because ""task"" in Android doesn't necessarily map to one process. It's an interesting engineering problem and I hope, for entirely selfish reasons, Samsung makes a good choice there.<p>However, that doesn't make the resulting product a threat to Android. It would start on one or two handsets. It would lack Google's ecosystem, and building the right alliances in the right regions is a heck of a product marketing problem.

We worked around the clock to address the form factor of our products. Epic is now the size of two matchboxes. It has gotten 50% slimmer and sits 1cm shorter. We completely redesigned the optics to improve usability by adding smart tip tracking, which blocks out objects that do not resemble a keystroke. To improve user experience, Epic now connects via simplified Bluetooth pairing that does not require pass codes.
In addition, new pairing button has been implemented for easy access and connection with latest and popular devices. Speaking of new devices, Epic is compatible with Blackberry 10 devices, notably the Blackberry Z10 and upcoming Q10 models.<p>Spec Sheet: http://d.pr/i/MjKe<p>I'll hopefully be writing a blog post about this shortly.",1369099113

I know everyone's been a bit shaken up with google's flurry of closures, but this isn't like reader, it's actually being monetized. Not to mention that Google recently consolidated Gmail and Picasa/G+ photo storage into Drive accounts -- this hints that google's long-term plan might be to treat Drive like a sort of unified storage system. This makes sense given google's recent push to unify everything, and should ensure it some stability. If anything, it's more likely that they'll kill off Chrome OS/Chromebooks (which heavily rely on Drive) before they kill off Drive[1], so I feel relatively safe with it. I would go so far as to say that Dropbox feels just as safe because Google isn't exactly a competitor that should be underestimated (despite their many flops).<p>Either way, I use Docs <i>way</i> too much, to the point where I always have a tab with it open, and Drive really ties everything in quite smoothly for me. I also like the Drive app a bit more than the Dropbox app on my android phone, so not really a strong incentive for me to switch back. I actually never made much of a conscious decision to switch to Drive in the first place, it just kind of happened automatically due to convenience, and now I use it almost exclusively.<p>The only thing that does bug me is the data-loss. I haven't had it happen in Drive proper, but it happening in the short time I've used Keep certainly lends credibility to it being a wider-spread problem.

I'm happy paying $25/year for what I get.<p>Now, to get all the same benefits that I was getting for $25/year, I can just degrade to a free account?  I guess this assumes that there are a lot of mobile users now and installing ad-blockers on mobile is much more difficult.<p>Still, what a strange decision.",1369098116

Obviously some people will - but I'm guessing those will be few enough not to matter.<p>The bulk of the people who want to host 2 Terabytes of Photos will be fine paying $500/year, those who aren't can create multiple accounts.    (Those who just want Local+Cloud backups are probably better served by just buying a 2 TB Hard Drive for $90, and backing up with backblaze for $50/year",1369098105
5741272,comment,5741035,5741035,1,0,Cogito,,,"I think this model is flawed.<p>It tries to boil the problem down to a 'discomfort' level, where what really matters is how long I think I can comfortably stay on the road, how fast I can cross the road, and how long I expect to wait to cross the road.<p>Let's assume all sections of the road are equally good for crossing (no pedestrian crossings etc). The road will then have a 'maximum angle of attack' which is a function of how fast I am travelling and how long I can stay on the road. I will walk in roughly the same pattern as in the link HOWEVER I will never cross at an angle greater than the maximum and I will potentially cross earlier or later depending on gaps in the traffic; it's faster to keep walking then to wait for a gap in traffic.<p>The main shortcoming in the model is that there is no upper limit on the angle of attack, and so it is easy to find example situations that are unrealistic.",1369098094

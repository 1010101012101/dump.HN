I accused the article of baiting us into falsely generalizing from Inge&#x27;s case to conclude (fuzzily) that &quot;evicted poor people only mind being kicked out because they&#x27;re a bunch of ungrateful slobs that turn down the abundant opportunities everybody heaps upon them because they believe they are entitled to something better&quot;. Inge&#x27;s hypothetical wealthy twin evictee would not have been a better candidate to advance this agenda because smearing her would not have smeared the protesting masses who, by and large, are not as wealthy.<p>> My second point was intended to state that I am not sure what type of person would be &quot;representative&quot; of the individuals evicted<p>I gave you three examples. A fourth example would be to choose an evictee at random and investigate them. It&#x27;s entirely possible that this is how the story came about and that it&#x27;s coincidental that she is such an unsympathetic figure. My original post observed that the likelihood of  interpretation #4 is lowered by the extreme nature of Inge&#x27;s case.<p>> criticizing an author for not finding a person who does not fit an undefined descriptor seems unfair to the columnist.<p>In a world of incomplete knowledge, finite opportunity cost, and human-resource-intensive processes for rigorous inference it&#x27;s entirely fair to have a complaint that is not mathematically precise.",1394588207

The basic gist of the game is as follows:<p>Step 1 - Buy a property that is impacted by certain regulatory constraints (which depresses it&#x27;s market value heavily).\nStep 2 - If you are cheap, sit, wait, and pray that natural forces relive you of the regulatory burden (or make life a living hell for your existing tenant in an attempt to get them to move out).  If you have some money, actively spend it to rid your property of regulatory constraints.\nStep 3 - Once unburdened (or partially relived) of said constraints, sell the property and profit handsomely.<p>This game is primarily played with rent controlled units and TICs.

Some future moves can never lead to a better score for you and so are discarded or ignored.<p>Both approaches need you to look as many moves ahead as you can - each extra move you consider multiplies the number of possibilities exponentially, so there is another method called iterative deepening[3] which uses the algorithm to look 1 move ahead to find the best move and records that move. Then  it repeats looking at 2 moves ahead and if it finds a better score than with 1 move it keeps that instead. Then 3 moves, then 4.

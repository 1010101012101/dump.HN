It is based on a row/column view of the data that may not be appropriate and which may require additional hoops to be jumped through in order to get the data presentable for the assumptions that SQL makes.

From the link you provide, it explains that the statue of frauds makes a contract voidable (either party can break it) but it's still a contract.
Also: 'Sometimes, a party to a contract that would otherwise be invalid under a ""statute of frauds"" will nonetheless be able to enforce it, on the basis of ""partial performance"" or ""promissory estoppel"".'

One of the core requirements of ECMAScript 3.1 (now 5) was to make the language more secure.<p>For example, in strict mode you can't declare new variables which are eval'd. This makes it harder to XSS. As does the reservation of eval (so it can't be overridden) and the denial of access to the global object.<p>This is really important because using strict will not only make your JavaScript better (more like ""The Good Parts"") but also more performant (less global scope) and more secure.",1260560136

Software Engineering is about nuclear reactor software, traffic flow control software, car injection system firmware, weather prediction grid software, lunar rover software, and, just maybe (but this is at the borderline), ERP software.<p>Meanwhile, web applications (that aren't Google-search scale projects) don't require <i>any</i> software ""engineering""—they're simply designed and then crafted, more like a clay pot than a bridge. They're iterated like a play is rewritten slightly after each performance, based on audience approval and obvious errors, not based on any accepted theorem or body of knowledge that says that the given practice is wrong.<p>A corollary of that statement is that Software Engineering has no use for most of us here at HN :)",1260558742

How will SQL deal with low-level semantics that do not provide transactions in the way SQL-users understand them but requires the user to understand the concepts of the CAP principle?</i><p>I'm not sure what you mean. SQL Databases have varying feature-sets already and SQL copes just fine. A ""NoSQL"" backend would simply be yet another type of database, lining up with e.g. MySQL and Postgres.<p>It's just a matter of applying the verbs (SELECT, CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE) in a meaningful way.<p>The individual stores could even extend the language to a degree, just like the RDBMS flavours do today. The important wins would be a common baseline (select foo from bar), a standarized way for human interaction (adhoc queries in a console are very useful) and a much easier migration path from traditional RDBMs.<p><i>How well does SQL deal with conflicting data being returned from retrieval operation?</i><p>Again I wonder what you mean?<p>If you're referring to versioned stores, or stores with particular semantics, then I'd imagine things like that to be simply embedded into the response. I.e. all tables returned by a select-statement could simply contain an additional column containing the tuple version. The user can then deal with that meta-data using the usual, time-tested SQL machinery (select .. where version=, group by, etc.)<p>Yes, this means every store needs slightly different treatment. But that's no different to how we treat RDBMs today - a common baseline with variance in the more specific features (column-types, indexes, triggers etc.).<p><i>I certainly hope that document-store developers do not take the lazy route and prematurely converge on a standard like SQL.</i><p>That's a strange wish to have as it only makes life harder for everyone. I don't see anything bad about SQL (the language) that would prevent it from taking this role.<p>Moreover the query language doesn't need to have ties into the underlying implementation - it's merely a common vocabulary.<p>SQL seems like a natural choice due to its ubiquity.<p>LINQ, in my book, is an ORM and operates at a different level of abstraction. Pig and HiveQL otoh are exactly what I have in mind - SQL dialects.",1260558688

Random Fortune 500 Company is not going to buy into an iterative development process, because the person at the client company is usually some peon with little real power to adjust budget or requirements as necessary.  That is, until it's too late, and their superiors are breathing down their necks because the website doesn't do what they didn't say it should do.  Plus, if you don't use an iterative process, you can bill your client for massive change orders.<p>So there's no real incentive on either side to change the process, unless both companies ""get it"" from the start that you can't make quality software this way.

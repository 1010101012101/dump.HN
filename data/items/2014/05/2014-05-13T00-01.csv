7736160,comment,7734418,7735303,1,0,brownbat,,,"This raises an interesting point about &quot;tamper revealing&quot; methods of security. Open source, publicized hashes of executables, even key exchange protocols, all of these prevent attacker tampering by making it more likely attacks (or even just bad code) will get noticed. They don&#x27;t strictly prevent tampering, they discourage it.<p>Take DHKE. It &quot;defends&quot; against MITM. But it doesn&#x27;t strictly prevent it. An attacker could perform the protocol with both Alice and Bob separately, then guard the line and tamper with any communications on that channel that attempt to confirm the shared secret. The attacker couldn&#x27;t win against a determined Alice and Bob, though, because A&B could theoretically use other channels, or even publicly broadcast some confirmation of the shared secret. So the smart attacker is &quot;probably discouraged&quot; from the noisy MITM.<p>But how many key exchange implementations actually use separate (availability ensuring) channels to confirm no one is in the middle? It&#x27;s prohibitively expensive to verify no one&#x27;s attacking something that no one ever attacks.<p>But then again, things no defender verifies are attractive to attackers. And some attackers are willing to get noticed 9 times out of 10 to land the one payout. &quot;Tolerance for getting caught&quot; is not always zero, that&#x27;s another variable that complicates our Nash equilibrium here...",1399942692

And it is funny no matter if you love or hate PHP.<p><i>I can’t even say what’s wrong with PHP, because— okay. Imagine you have uh, a toolbox. A set of tools. Looks okay, standard stuff in there.<p>You pull out a screwdriver, and you see it’s one of those weird tri-headed things. Okay, well, that’s not very useful to you, but you guess it comes in handy sometimes.<p>You pull out the hammer, but to your dismay, it has the claw part on both sides. Still serviceable though, I mean, you can hit nails with the middle of the head holding it sideways.<p>You pull out the pliers, but they don’t have those serrated surfaces; it’s flat and smooth. That’s less useful, but it still turns bolts well enough, so whatever.<p>And on you go. Everything in the box is kind of weird and quirky, but maybe not enough to make it completely worthless. And there’s no clear problem with the set as a whole; it still has all the tools.<p>Now imagine you meet millions of carpenters using this toolbox who tell you “well hey what’s the problem with these tools? They’re all I’ve ever used and they work fine!” And the carpenters show you the houses they’ve built, where every room is a pentagon and the roof is upside-down. And you knock on the front door and it just collapses inwards and they all yell at you for breaking their door.<p>That’s what’s wrong with PHP.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/</a>",1399942181

Iovine is one of the few folks that can get an exclusive deal done with content owners and he understands marketing in a way no one at Apple currently does.

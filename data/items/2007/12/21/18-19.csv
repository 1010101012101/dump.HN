Part of the culture, I guess.<p>I've been hearing about Google investing into alternative energy projects, including Nanosolar <i>and</i> a (non-torrodial) fusion group that was formerly funded by the government. I've been hearing these rumors for the past two years or so. I heard about the Nanosolar bit right when Google was building all those datacenters, including the one in Washington (or Oregon?) near that huge power plant. I had also heard that Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Page's brother, Carl Page funded Nanosolar. You know, right after the Google IPO and Carl Page sold his company to Yahoo. (Though they supposedly invested a few years before the payday, so ... ). <p>All of this is hearsay, of course. <a href=""http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/06/google_founders.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/06/google_founders.php</a><p>Here's the bottom line. Nanosolar has hungry customers beating down their door. Like the NYTimes article says, why should they be making a big media fuss right now? Why do they need to prove to the world about those figures? It actually reminds me pre-IPO Google.com. ""Come see for yourself.""",1198261185

They might even have gotten subsidies and tax incentives for locating their factory there. There may also be logistics issues because they are not using silicon.",1198260642

If it&#x27;s a spammer, then the answer is no, it&#x27;s not good.<p>However, if it&#x27;s a company you signed up for their email list, then you want tracking. You want them to send you advert&#x27;s that you are actually interested in. You want them to not waste you time (and inbox space) with advert&#x27;s that you will never be interested in.

That takes years, at which point the teacher is unemployed and may years later receive compensation. Good luck expecting that to go well.<p>Nah, it&#x27;s an institutional problem; you&#x27;d solve it with slightly different rules about how schools are run. For instance, you could give principals more autonomy over hiring/firing teachers but make it harder to fire THEM, thereby reducing the ability of nitwit politicians to exert pressure to fire particular people. You could make more of the relevant intermediary jobs (like state superintendent) nonpartisan, and make <i>being</i> nonpartisan an explicit part of the job. You could add more transparency to hiring/firing decisions and leave it to the voters to punish politicians who do that sort of thing - if regular elections aren&#x27;t enough disincentive, then add a petition-based recall process.<p>Or you could recognize that political sea changes at the local level don&#x27;t happen often enough for this to be a significant problem, so we shouldn&#x27;t worry about it until and unless it actually happens. Don&#x27;t institute cures that are worse than the disease. (The fact that some district in Texas has this problem doesn&#x27;t mean you need tenure everywhere in the country.)<p>Though the real solution is more <i>student</i> autonomy. Let parents decide which schools to send their kids to rather than arbitrarily assigning them to a specific one and the whole issue basically goes away. If parents don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s being taught to their kids, make it easy for them to go elsewhere or teach the kids at home and they don&#x27;t NEED to get rid of bad teachers. (When people don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s served at a restaurant, they don&#x27;t typically lobby to fire the cook, they just eat somewhere else! Because they CAN.)<p>Fundamentally, the purpose of a school system is to benefit the <i>students</i>, not the teachers. If you want to convince people tenure is a good idea, you need to make the case from that perspective - why it helps the students. Otherwise it just sounds like special pleading.",1402519955

Many of them used to be taxi drivers and have told me about how much they prefer driving for Uber.  They also tend to be very happy with their income.  I remember in particular one recent driver&#x27;s big grin as he raved about Uber and praised Travis the entire ride for letting him, his wife, and his two kids live such a great lifestyle.  His wife would even take the car out and do some Uber driving once in a while while he spent time with the kids.<p>The calculations in the article seem to be based on just a couple numbers -- such as the 40,000 miles per year that Uber gave for the purpose of cost of ownership calculation, which is used to try to calculate the hours drivers work and the fare they earn per hour.  Some real numbers about fares earned would help here.  The conclusion is not clearly stated in the &quot;Conclusion&quot; section, but here&#x27;s my interpretation:  If you make certain assumptions about an uberX driver, you find they make about as much as a typical taxi driver.  This suggests that driving uberX instead of a taxi does not automatically put you in a completely different income bracket, but I think the devil is in the details.  Obviously the spread between different drivers is much, much larger than the spread between taxis and uberXs.  If we made a histogram of income for each and superimposed them, they would be two humps with a lot of overlap.  It would be more interesting to know, for example, how the jobs of top-earning uberX drivers and top taxi drivers compare.<p>Then there are implications that Uber is another Groupon, and its financial success is dependent on a steady stream of investment dollars.  Well, Uber is making plenty of money.  They write software and do operations and the money just pours in.  Every user is a paying customer, and the vast majority of users come away satisfied and happy to have a better way to get from point A to point B.  The drivers make money and are thrilled.  Some people take Uber literally every day.  Seems like a pretty good business to me.",1402519155

They seem to breeze over MUDs/gaming even though that&#x27;s a large part of what got people into BBSes to begin with.<p>From the early 1990s and on through the present, if you want to find out what governments are doing with your data, who has your credit cards and SSN, what the next major DDoS attack target will be, or get the dirty details [along with photo evidence] on the social lives of the most popular hackers, you go to IRC. To learn about the hacker underground they should be reading IRC transcripts.<p>Edit: I forgot about one of the newer and more exciting aspects of the cyber crime, hacktivist and hacker underground groups: web forums. Want to know who&#x27;s planning Jihad on a Yahoo! Groups page? Want to know who&#x27;s planning a &quot;digital sit-in&quot; (e.g. DDoS) alongside an Occupy or animal rights group? Want to get crack cocaine delivered to your front door (without using Silk Road)? Want to buy 10,000 US credit card numbers? Want to rent out a botnet of a million nodes for an hour? It&#x27;s all on (somewhat) publicly-accessible web forums.<p>While we all like to play dumb that these forms of cyber-crime and vigilantism aren&#x27;t &quot;really hackers&quot;, they use the same techniques and often co-exist with the more &quot;respectable&quot; hackers. It&#x27;s not uncommon for a more traditional hacker to live a double life (and make some nice coin on the side), committing a lot of the back-room crimes that someone else later gets caught for using.

If you are looking for feedback, I noticed you were using the skrollr plugin for parallax effect; I only reviewed the code for about 50 seconds but it appears to use the top/bottom/etc CSS properties to achieve the movement effects. On my browser (Chrome Version 35.0.1916.114) running on my 2014 MBP there is some animation chop. I believe you could resolve this by using the CSS translate property instead, which would trigger GPU acceleration to better animate the effects. Alternatively I believe you could simply add the translate property set to 0 on the moving elements and it will also trigger GPU acceleration (I have been told this also works although I have not tested it myself.). It might be difficult to implement since you are using a library, but it may be worth checking out.<p>EDIT: Grammar.",1402518027

Then I have a 1U switch, it&#x27;s nothing special, cheapest gigabit switch that got good reviews.  And then for my load balancing and SSL, I got a Kemp Technologies hardware load balancer.  It&#x27;s got a little ASIC in it that offloads the SSL from the servers.  I think I can sustain 200 concurrent SSL requests, which is fine for me right now while I develop my app.<p>In my 1U holding the servers, each server has a two disk software RAID-1 setup.  I can&#x27;t physically get to the colo but once or twice a year max, so I need to be able to withstand a drive failure here or there.<p>I think I get a drive failure about once every 2 years, and one ram stick failure so far.  I had one motherboard failure, but it was a VIA technologies chip/board, and since then I have switched fully to the intel-produced slim Mini-ITX Atom motherboards, and those things are rock solid - just wish I could get 8GB of ram for them for more memcached goodness.  ;)<p>I don&#x27;t even know if my dual Mini-ITX server enclosure is sold anymore, it&#x27;s kindof freakish especially with heat.  Since I built this box I have been investigating &quot;shorty&quot; or &quot;short depth&quot; 1U enclosures.  I wanted to be able to pack in the servers, and you&#x27;re allowed to bolt servers to both sides of the rack.  So by transferring my servers to shorty enclosures, I should be able to spread the heat out a little better and max out my space.  I think I have space right now for 3 more shorty boxes if I need to expand my cluster.<p>Edit:  for physical access, you just call the support line and either ask for remote hands/smart hands if it&#x27;s something simple like rebooting a box for you, or you can schedule a time to come in.  I&#x27;ve never been turned away from coming in the same day and when I want to.  I am usually alone in the server room when I work.

Uber is not\nabout &quot;sharing rides&quot;, it&#x27;s a regular business.<p><i>The essential difference between Uber and the other apps is that Uber uses unlicensed drivers, while the other apps use licensed drivers.</i><p>Taxi companies <i>in Germany</i> need two kinds of licenses:<p>* Each driver must have a drivers license that allows commercial transportation\n  of passengers. The regular drivers license doesn&#x27;t cover transporting people\n  for profit. If you do it anyways, you&#x27;re essentially driving without a\n  license, which voids your car insurance. Apparently, passengers don&#x27;t even\n  have to pay unlicensed drivers, because the license is required for\n  transportation contracts to be valid. According to Wikipedia, the\n  commercial license costs about EUR 400 for 5 years and requires a medical\n  checkup, clean driving and criminal records, and you have to prove your\n  knowledge of the place you&#x27;re going to drive at. &quot;Uber Black&quot; drivers have\n  such a commercial license. &quot;Uber Pop&quot; drivers don&#x27;t, they just need a\n  clean criminal record. So they are probably not insured if they drive for\n  profit.<p>* Each taxi company needs a concession that grants the right to run a taxi\n  service, but also requires the company to fulfill its public role:\n  operate the service day and night, don&#x27;t decline any passengers\n  (e.g. in order to wait for more profitable destinations), and take the\n  official rate. Yes, prices are regulated, probably to protect both passengers\n  and drivers.\n  To get a concession, you have to prove that you are\n  able to run a taxi / rental car company according to the law, and pay a small\n  fee for each of your cars. It&#x27;s not expensive, but the number of concessions \n  in each city is limited, which is why there&#x27;s a &quot;black market&quot; in some places.\n  You can&#x27;t sell concessions, but you can offer willing drivers a shortcut\n  around the waiting list by selling them shares of your company [1].<p>Uber doesn&#x27;t have a concession, they want to be a bit more flexible with regards\nto privileges and rights. Real markets are inefficient, and &quot;disrupting&quot; them\ncan also mean that <i>customers</i> might be worse off in the future. For instance,\nwhen no real taxis are left, and Uber decides that its service should be more\nexpensive in bad weather... [2] Or when Uber doesn&#x27;t want to pick you up\nbecause of your bad rating, but there is no other way for you to get home.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.derwesten.de/politik/so-funktioniert-der-betrug-im-taxigewerbe-in-koeln-id4187250.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.derwesten.de/politik/so-funktioniert-der-betrug-i...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5221428/uber-surge-pricing-vs-price-gouging-law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5221428/uber-surge-pricin...</a>",1402517097

By very little, I mean essentially none.<p>In years past, I have come across a bunch of sites such as https://www.megaproxy.com/freesurf/. The specific functionality of this site is irrelevant - what I am curious about is one specific aspect. When the user enters an address (s)he wants to surf anonymously, the result is the external page desired but with a ""megaproxy bar"" across the top that stays fixed as you scroll on the page. Here is an example (Hacker News): http://bit.ly/B9t1s<p>I have a couple of questions now.<p>1. How did they do this? Is it just a custom javascript? Is it very complex? Is there more than one way to do it?<p>2. How would you describe this to another coder? I can only imagine the odd stare I would get if I said, ""You know, one site displays a page from another site but keeps a header at the top and it remains stationary as you scroll and stays at the top even as they click links on the page.""<p>3. Who passes the bandwidth? I see that resulting pages have a megaproxy URL in the linked example but does the actual page content pass over their servers? Maybe it does in this case due to the nature of the site, but does it have to?<p>4. When the user enters the desired URL on megaproxy and goes to the site, the browser seems to be resized automatically. Is there a way to avoid this?<p>I've spent some time searching Google but without knowing the proper terminology to search I'm having a hard time. Thanks in advance for your help.",1218569173

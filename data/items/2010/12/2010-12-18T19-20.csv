This is a free service and it serves some of YC's needs but there are no ads, it isn't monetized, etc.  Unlike some of the websites folks here own, it seems to me HN does not provide enough value for pg to justify jumping through hoops backwards, blindfolded and on fire to make folks here happy with some cutting edge, WOW! coding.<p>(Personal note: Now I feel better about my sites being laid out in tables. :-P)",1292702290

2020128,story,,,70,61,Loic,"Tell HN: Doing a PhD is good",,"Or having a higher education. A general trend here is to discard PhD/higher education as a waste of time or money when one want to go the startup way. Effectively, you can become rich without such education, but very few of them get really rich and on the barrier to entry, if you consider a field where you can be disruptive without education is rather low.<p>The real good point of having a PhD is not in the title you get, it is in the network you can build and the problems you try to solve. By definition, most of the scientific PhD are to solve industrial problems. This means, you have a complex problem and customers, directly, right now, during your studies.<p>If you are smart, you can already have a portfolio of customers at the end of your PhD, you can have your product nearly ready and you will be able to charge your customers more in thousands of Dollars than in $9 per month.<p>Bonus point, the barrier to entry will be high for the competition and it is relatively easy to become an expert in your field.<p>So please, if you want to do a PhD, do it and do it wisely.<p>A short list to think about:<p>1. Get a supervisor known to give his students a lot of freedom.
2. Do your PhD in a country where you get a good pay (most of the EU countries pay well for a PhD).
3. Go in a university with a good budget for travel to conferences.

Since I haven't really got a developer network I was hoping that I could here some of your thoughts. I believe a lot of what I have done is unique (at-least a little) but wouldn't be surprised if someone points me to people doing the same thing.<p>The API is fully browseable through a browser and follows most of the standard REST API idioms. I know its not technically 100% REST, but the few things I chose to do (verbs other than GET/POST, /v1/ in url) I believe were good decisions - but are still obviously up for debate.<p>The API can output in HTML/XML/JSON/PHP(serialized)/PY(pickled). You can get each format either with an appropriate ""Accept:"" header, or file extensions (/v1/client/add.json). Some commands (such as POST /v1/invoice/136891/pdf) will always return a certain content type (in this case a PDF file).<p>GET requests are used for browsing the API. For instance ""GET /v1"" will return an index, but whats quite cool is ""GET /v1/client/add"" will return a form in order to create a client. The form code is available in all the exports. A ""POST /v1/client/add"" is used to add clients. In order to make testing in a browser simpler, adding ""?post"" to a URL will treat it as a POST request with the other variables.<p>Known issues:<p>a. The API is rather incomplete. I'm quite aware of that, but I believe what is up is enough to relay the style and content of the rest. I do have a couple of small issues (such as repeating fields - invoice lines, etc) but am busy working out plans for those.<p>b. BASIC AUTH isn't great. I have several other methods planned but for the initial launch it'll have to do.<p>c. Theres no documentation. I'll get something basic up by the time we launch and improve it from there. I honestly believe the browsable nature should be enough for now though.<p>d. I only created one user with test data for HN. Hopefully that won't be a problem :)<p>[if you interested in actual startup request invitation at http://www.snapbill.com and expect a Review my Startup sometime next month :)]",1292701565

But you completely miss the boat by assuming that people 'fear' advertisement, some people just really dislike it on principle.  This is especially true when it comes to free culture projects who wish to be self-sustainable and perhaps even feel as if their efforts are validated a bit by the willingness of their users to support their project.<p>Wikipedia is a huge project with tremendous social value.  It is sad to me that you may be right that an advertisement would bring in 10x the revenue, because it means we're in a culture in which one expects to perpetually be in commercial relationships.  This makes the user more likely to purchase a consumer good than they are to donate to a service that has been consistently offering them more value.<p>The reason for this is that any direct donation based system is deeply damaged by the mass tendency to assume that someone else is in a better position to donate.  In fact, the more valuable (and successful) a project is, the more this becomes a problem.  But this problem is cultural, in an ideal world people would have a greater social responsibility without the need for assuming someone else is going to take care of important services like these.  To push us in that direction, we get a giant fucking picture of Jimmy Wales to make us feel guilty and give.  Personally, this has about the same negative impact on me that an advertisement would, albeit for different reasons.<p>I think the real solution is for Wikipedia to find a better way to fund itself in a grassroots fashion.  I have trouble seeing how the Wikimedia Foundation can't come up with other ways to fund themselves.  They have a tremendous amount of content and data.

Nearly all questions asked about standards of written English, which are arbitrary and uninteresting to a linguist, except in that the bickering over what is “proper” might bring to our attention divergent forms among varieties of English.<p>For people interested in the debate over whether a “correct” English (or any language for that matter) exists, here is an interesting article by Geoffrey Pullum:<p><a href=""http://people.ucsc.edu/~pullum/MLA2004.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.ucsc.edu/~pullum/MLA2004.pdf</a><p>Re: written English vs. spoken English
Spoken English is a primary linguistic form while written English is secondary or parasitic on spoken forms, so actually from a linguistic perspective, calling written English a language is wrong.  English exists in speakers’ minds and written English is a filtered encoding of that language with certain non-linguistic constraints put upon it (e.g. in my dialect of English, dropping an auxiliary at the beginning of a yes/no question is completely okay, but in writing, I hardly ever do this, unless in a very informal context.  This is because written standards tell me not to.)",1292699315

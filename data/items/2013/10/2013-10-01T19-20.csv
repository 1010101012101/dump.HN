No. It&#x27;s about shift from zero security (no passcode lock) to some security (fingerprint). Yes it can be fooled but it is effective enough to stop casual attacks.

So I&#x27;m in the middle of doing what so many on here already suggested:<p>1)MOOCS (Coursera, edx)
2)Crowdsourced resources (wikibooks)
3)Free/freemium online books (<a href=""http://programming-motherfucker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programming-motherfucker.com/</a>)

I know this from my formal teaching background and feel comfortable with the learning part of this entire venture.<p>The second part of your questions though about finding work I&#x27;m not so sure about as I&#x27;m not there yet. I personally have chosen python as my language to learn because I&#x27;ve found that:<p>1)It makes sense to me after trying out a couple of different languages on codeacademy
2)The clean syntax and forced indenting structure allows me to focus more on the problem domain then the language itself (or which indenting/bracket style to use). This can be said of any language I&#x27;m sure as people have different preferences and perspectives, but this was clearly evident to me early on.
3)With the discovery of Django and so many other python based tools, I realized that I could actually achieve a lot by specializing in python. But of course I need to include html, css, and perhaps random java script as well to get a dynamic web page going, but at least Django frees me from needing to get into php.
4)I personally have a creative mind and less of an engineering mind. Learning C or some other lower level language would drive me nuts I think AS A FIRST LANGUAGE. I&#x27;m able to casually learn about different algorithms and data structures in python without having to fully master them just to make a basic program (as I would in C for example).<p>Now my goals might be different from you, I have a long list of projects and ideas that I would like to do on my own that could possibly make money, so I&#x27;m making all my decisions from a passion perspective, not as a supply/demand one.

I&#x27;ve always felt that there are always plenty of people doing the &quot;standard learning&quot; track for the &quot;standard jobs&quot; that the market demands.

The basic concept is:<p>1) Use Rails, to ease development of plugins and per-site functionality.<p>2) Don&#x27;t save content or site config in the database. Save it to disk.<p>3) Git keeps track of your content and config, just like a regular Rails project. The user-friendly admin interface is actually just a wrapper around Git plus a text editor and some menus. Developers can work in a text editor and a terminal while the client works in the GUI.<p>4) Because content and config are Git-controlled text files and not database records, you have a sane workflow for developing locally then deploying.",1380656552

Oh, it&#x27;s when I mouse over the left column.  I tend to move the mouse cursor out of the way of my text area when I&#x27;m typing, and if I stow it to the left it triggers the slide-over as it passes over the left column.<p>Figure out that the 3-stacked-horizontal lines can close the slider.  Click again to re-open --- that makes sense.  But if I click to close, then move the mouse cursor off the page to the left it reopens.  Repeat a few times, give up, leave it open.<p>Start typing.  Nothing happens.  Scan the screen for a typing cursor.  Can&#x27;t find one.  Tab?  Nope.  Type again, don&#x27;t see anything changing. OK, I guess they want me to click somewhere.   Another couple dizzying screen slides, and I can type.<p>Ok, let&#x27;s change the silly title I put in to start with.  Up-arrow, up-arrow, nothing is happening.  There seems to be no way to get there from here.  Tab, shift-tab?  Nope.  Guess I&#x27;ve got to click.  But I really appreciated that both Tab and Return took be back to the text from the title.<p>Type a bit, looks clean.  But not sure what I&#x27;m supposed to be doing.  I&#x27;ll try creating a new &#x27;note&#x27;.  For the first time, open the slider on the left intentionally.  Click &#x27;new note&#x27;.  Eeeeek!  I&#x27;m greated with a giant multi-colored blocker in the middle of the screen.  And it&#x27;s wobbling a few pixels back and forth at about 2 Hz, making me nauseous.<p>Escape doesn&#x27;t work.

However, the actual user experience of browsing for books on the internet still pretty much sucks. Most places take the low-hanging fruit and have pretty good searching capability. However, searching and browsing are not the same experience. Recommendations (like from Amazon) is not browsing -- it&#x27;s prompting based on intentional searching.<p>To do online browsing well, you have to come back to what the UX for browsing in a library or a bookstore feels like. You wander around spaces, and pick out books that catch your attention. Illustrations on book covers means a lot more. And for people like me that process information kinesthetically, the spatial relationships of the books (where it is on the shelf, which shelf it is on, how many steps it takes to go down one aisle, how wide are the aisles in relation to how far I can stretch my arms, etc.) matters a lot more.<p>I&#x27;ve toyed with the notion of creating a dedicated Android app to prototype this idea. That is, creating an online browsing experience to replace my bookshelf so that I can show it off for guests. Some of the lessons that can be extracted from creating that would apply to an online browsing experience -- or a physical retail experience that includes an online component.<p>Looking at how Scribd redid their site to support this, I think they understand some of the issues. But in the end, it looks more like they are copying Netflix rather than really rethinking at a more fundamental level of what &quot;browsing&quot; means as an experience.",1380655701

You can find estimates on the internet of fire department costs for one incident hovering in the mid-thousands, assuming no complications, and that&#x27;s the FD&#x27;s <i>cost basis</i>, not the chargeable cost.<p>Ultimately I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much to learn from what happened in Obion County.

The lack of a large enough market for skills at that level speaks of the lack of problems that hard being tackled.<p>You&#x27;re right about SV being underpaid, too. Those salaries look big until you factor in the cost of living and the number of hours you work.<p>Hint:<p>If you make $120,000/year and work 60 hours a week, you actually make about $80,000/year when compared to someone who works 40 hours a week and makes $80,000/year.

Your <i>net profit per hour worked</i> is what you make, not your gross income. If you live check to check, you make nothing.<p>Edit:<p>The only <i>minor</i> wrinkle here is debt. If you have a lot of debt, then making the numbers bigger works to your advantage provided you use those bigger numbers to reduce your debt in nominal terms. Example: paying 10% of a 100k income against your debt will pay it off <i>exponentially</i> faster than paying 10% of a 60k income. This is why politicians love inflation.

Cars can not drive through other cars, thus, if one car stops or slows down, all cars behind it stop or slow down.<p>Second, 5000 cars cannot travel 65mph over one mile of road, because it is physically impossible to fit 5000 cars inside a one lane 1-mile stretch of road. This is the bottleneck that causes the initial traffic jam.<p>In order to get all 5000 cars to travel the distance of a mile <i>in the same TIME</i> as 1 car, your only option is to increase their speed. But our speed is limited (by the speed limit of the road), so the only thing we can do is squish them together and hope for as fast a speed as possible given the dimensions.<p>If all the cars were linked and communicated in unison, they could react immediately and maintain a high degree of coordination in moving around each other and traveling as fast as the number of cars and speed limit will allow over a given area. Unfortunately, humans suck ass at driving, and their communication and latency make the movements of cars much much slower than is theoretically possible.<p>--<p>So what does &quot;leaving space&quot; actually do within our constraints of number of cars and max mph? It smooths out the errors humans make in driving. Specifically, it adds a time buffer for communication and decision-making; more time is given to driving decisions in order to prevent unnecessary stops, which would slow or stop the cars behind it.<p>What &quot;leaving space&quot; does NOT do is change the laws of our physical world. The given number of cars still have a maximum possible speed in a given distance, due to the traffic laws and physics.<p>Is it possible that the buffering from leaving space in the road will cause traffic to actually move faster than the starting-and-stopping of human error? Yes.<p>But it also uses up additional space, which is equivalent to more cars on the road, which as we know from above means a lower speed to travel the same distance.<p>--<p>You can not get away from it - until you reduce the number of cars or increase the max speed, your traffic jams will remain.<p>As for my personal opinion, I believe the one thing that could reduce traffic slowness is to speed up merges. If you want to help a traffic jam, merge at a speed faster than the cars around you and accelerate away from the merge area. It won&#x27;t permit more cars on the road, but if a car is going 45mph and you move in front of it going 35mph, physics only allows for two results: the car behind you will hit you, or the car and <i>all the cars behind it</i> will have to slow down to 35mph.<p>The other thing that could be done is sensors in the road could detect the level of traffic (number of cars) and provide on a digital display the maximum speed humans could manage for that many cars on the road. If all cars then traveled at that speed, we would slowly but at a continuous pace travel down the highway without any stops. Until the first asshole that merges slower than that speed, which would make everyone slow down to his speed, defeating the whole thing....",1380654966

That of course does not mean our society is lost, as in a dystopian view  Rather, think of this opportunity as an effort to achieve a forever-vacation for everyone for the rest of time creating unlimited happiness; and through the power of PubNub we&#x27;ll convert your typical adventure into to living stardust, where your consciousness will be jettisoned into the infinite cosmos, in an infinite journey of dimensional wonder, and discovery!!!!!<p>That&#x27;d be pretty great as long as we do it in a good way, right?  Can you help us achieve this?  We need next gen developers who are good at being remarkably insightful into the new future of network paths, BGP routes, TCP packets and Earth Based Topologies and Orchestrations.<p>Here is our jobs link: <a href=""http://www.pubnub.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pubnub.com/jobs</a><p>We&#x27;re also keeping an eye on the footprint of data that flows through PubNub, and we have a massively parallel MapReduce system written in Python/PyPy/Gevent/HLL which can process massive amounts of data in a few moments.  Yah we use it for big brother type stuff but also for your metering data too so we can bill you.<p>More onto the future of things to come, we&#x27;ve created essentially the scaffolding which brings us the necessary tooling to create the next singularity.  But we still have more to do and we need your help to push us further into future of connectivity.  Device-to-device communication is key, and JSON is our language.  Also something new is on the way that has been unannounced which kinda annihilates most hindrances for out ultimate goal.",1380654307

Metering limits the number of idiots on the road at a given time. I.e., my attempt at being intentionally stupid was mitigated because the meters prevented the road from nearing saturation. The little bit of wiggle room on the road made it relatively straight-forward to just route around me.<p>So yes, in one sense meters merely move the wait from one point to another but they also remove some of the interactive effects of human stupidity.<p>* <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoETMCosULQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoETMCosULQ</a>

It&#x27;s incredibly convenient. It unlocks my phone almost instantly. It prevents random people near by phone from being unable to unlock it. If a thief got their hands on it, they&#x27;d have a few attempts to unlock it with a fake fingerprint, and then they&#x27;d have to enter my code. And if they fail to enter my code 10 times, the phone is wiped.<p>All in all TouchID basically removes almost the entire burden from the security of having a locked phone. It&#x27;s actually faster to unlock my phone with TouchID than codeless swipe to unlock, so it&#x27;s a no-brainer to turn it on. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the NSA probably has my fingerprints, in practice it prevents most people from getting into my phone in a way that is transparent and easy to use.

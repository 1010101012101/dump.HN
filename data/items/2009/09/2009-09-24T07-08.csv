On the other hand, no other non-experimental statistical technique can do that either. Also, many problems will likely have a very constrained set of causal graphs to choose from, like smoking/tar/cancer.",1253779178

840781,comment,840523,840643,0,0,akeefer,,,"That's a bad conclusion to make:  it's the classic tradeoff between importance and urgency.  If you only ever do the urgent stuff, the hair-on-fire-has-to-be-done-yesterday stuff, you'll never make time to get to long-term strategic projects.<p>The payoff for something like unit testing, automated deployment, and continuous integration are over the very, very long haul.  If your cost/benefit analysis is always looking at 3- or 6-months out, it'll never seem like a win.<p>So if you only ever do the urgent stuff and never anything strategic, 3 years later you'll realize that if you'd just sucked it up back at the start and done that stuff, even if meant putting off otherwise urgent features, you'd be further ahead than you are now, because it would have more than made up for the initial investment.<p>So it's not that you don't do those things because they're not important, but rather because they're never urgent, and because most people's time horizons, especially in a startup, are fairly short.",1253779017

She appealed to people who were fed up with politics and politicians. For some reason Joel's argument reminds me of this. He seems to have examples of over the top designs gone bad but in the end I can't find much of real value to take away from this article. Is the visitor pattern too much? What about hibernate or other ORM tools?",1253779016
840779,comment,840702,840762,0,0,sambrightman,,,"If the rate of infection in the general population was even lower, say 1 in 100,000, and they actually trialled 200,000 people, finding that the vaccine perfectly prevented infection, should they conclude this with high confidence? Or have I misunderstood you?<p>Besides, Dr Kim is quoted elsewhere as saying ""the result could be due to chance"" and the vaguely phrased ""31.2 percent effective"" is not encouraging. Add in the likely funding source of AIDS vaccine trials, the pressure to get results and the unknown mechanism and it doesn't look so great.",1253778993

840744,comment,840523,840643,0,0,tdavis,,,"On the topic of testing, it's only currently viable to write tests for bugs which occur in the future and that are properly caught (I recently caught one completely by accident because it wasn't caught by our alert system). Going back and trying to write test cases for everything I've written up to this point simply makes no sense; they should have been written before the code, from the start (or from a point that I knew the code wouldn't be re-written again).<p>Automated deployment has been less of a priority because I don't really have to re-deploy that often (meaning spin up a new server). However, if/when I do need to, it will be automated. Even if I haven't written the scripts yet, I will do it before the new machine comes up.<p>Back when the system was created I had never been a ""TDDer"" before and the tools that exist now did not exist or were not viable for production, especially in terms of automated deployment and dependency management. If I could go back and do it again (or just murder someone) I'd love to have good test coverage and automation tools. It isn't that it's not important, it's just that the ship has sailed on half of it and the other half is situation-dependent at this stage.<p>In summary, it is THAT important. I will go as far to say that I think these two items in particular are more or less vital to the long-term viability of a software project. Anyone maintaining a large, aged project that contains no test coverage and no automated build / deploy tools has my deepest sympathies; it's like stacking an infinite house of cards.",1253775977

The bid by et3 contained letters of support by three entities in China to supply IP and key materials for the project. The engineering consultants hired by the authority did not dispute the validity of the et3 bid price or ETT technology, but recommended to eliminate the et3 bid from consideration for other reasons.</i>[1]<p>This comment doesn't pass judgment on whether Daryl Oster is a patent troll or not, but that's also a discussion worth having.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuated_Tube_Transport"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuated_Tube_Transport</a>",1339535344

Or rather, even if your debit card says Visa or Mastercard on it, they have no <i>legal</i> obligation to get your money back. You don't have an obligation to pay the merchant, but the impetus is on you to get your rightful money back (the debit card company may help, but they are not required to).<p>With a credit card, they don't exactly have an obligation either, but this time it works in your favor - it's the credit card's money, not yours, and while you still have no obligation to pay the merchant, this time it's the <i>company's</i> money that is on the line (the collateral, so to speak). So they will fight tooth-and-nail to get it back, because technically if they don't, they can't collect any money from you.<p>(They may still try, but then you have to weigh the cost of a legal battle with them as well).<p>Think of this in the context of theft/fraudulent use of your card, and you'll see why debit cards are very risky indeed.

4102848,comment,4102248,4102689,5,0,quanticle,,,"Kahneman divides our thinking into two subsystems: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 thinking is fast, intuitive, unconscious thought. Most everyday activities (like driving, talking, cleaning, etc.) make heavy use of the type 1 system. The type 2 system is slow, calculating, conscious thought. When you're doing a difficult math problem or thinking carefully about a philosophical problem, you're engaging the type 2 system. From Kahneman's perspective, the big difference between type 1 and type 2 thinking is that type 1 is fast and easy but very susceptible to bias, whereas type 2 is slow and requires conscious effort but is much more resistant to cognitive biases.<p>Traditionally, ""intelligence"" (as colloquially defined) has correlated with type 2 thinking. So, a reasonable conjecture would be that people who are better at type 2 thinking would use it more and, therefore be less vulnerable to bias. However, this research shows that even those who are very good at type 2 thinking (as measured by their SAT scores and NCS scores) are even more vulnerable to cognitive biases. This is a deeply counter-intuitive result. Why is it that people who have a greater <i>capacity</i> to overcome bias have a greater <i>vulnerability</i> to bias?",1339535048

Having Bb you can modulate (or ""change the key"") to F without having to switch scales etc.<p>Also, the fact that he found D, E and A among the results is probably because of modulations. It's VERY common for pop songs to modulate a whole step during some chorus near the end [1]. As mentioned, G, F and C are V, IV and I. If we modulate a whole step, from C to D, the V, IV and I are A, G and D. It would be nice to consider those modulations into the research.<p>About the key choice, I believe it's irrelevant.

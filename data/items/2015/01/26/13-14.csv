I&#x27;m in my early twenties, so I was a little late to the whole Marilyn Manson/Columbine show, and Cooper has always been a relic to me, but seeing a contemporary band I enjoy labelled shocking was rather odd to me. Of course I&#x27;m an American and Rammstein, though popular, was never in the spotlight so I was also never in a situation to have my parents question my choice in that particular band so that may factor into my lack of perspective.<p>The term is really just something for the previous generation to apply to something they find distasteful or scary. Sitting here writing about it really made me comprehend that term. I suppose +1 for rubber ducking.",1422280781

I go to the gym 5 days a week at 5:30am. I&#x27;m up at 4:45 whether I set an alarm or not. I&#x27;m sure part of it is circadian rhythms and the fact that I&#x27;m going to bed at 9pm instead of 1am now.

The episode progressed from the origins of the genre to what we have today, from Alice Cooper to Marilyn Manson and to Rammstein. What would probably be the money quotes come from Alice Cooper and Till Lindemann, of Rammstein. Everyone was asked the question &quot;what would it take to shock an audience today&quot; - Cooper said something along the lines of eating your own arm. Lindemann said killing oneself on stage might do it. Something that struck me when I started writing this comment is how I don&#x27;t even consider Rammstein&#x27;s schtick one bit shocking, and considering the finale of the last concert I attended involved Till riding a giant phallus cannon spraying white foam on the audience while singing a song titled &quot;Pussy&quot;. Seeing that in an arena with 15,000 other people would probably have been inconceivable just a generation ago, and makes some of Manson&#x27;s tearing up a bible look innocent, which in turn made Cooper&#x27;s guillotine routine and boa constrictor look quite quaint.<p>It seems each generation has become &quot;desensitized&quot; and it would take an act more shocking than ever before to provoke a reaction.

By publishing `jQuery.prototype&#x27; to `$.fn&#x27;, pushing the idea of &quot;plugins&quot;, and by encouraging DOM operations as the main extension point in application design, jQuery made itself into something more. The brittleness of this approach is proven by how calling jQuery UI component methods requires an additional level of dispatch. This way of doing things has no legacy. It&#x27;s considered an antipattern now, and a &quot;mess of jQuery&quot; is a known form of code debt.

There are some professional categories (doctors, funeral or wedding businesses, churches, etc) that exploit this weakness. When people are <i>emotional charged</i>, they don&#x27;t think about the unrealistic prices of some treatments or services, they are even happy to pay them. Without this <i>emotional charge</i>, they would bargain and complain about it.",1422277503

8946763,comment,8943463,8944024,0,0,mrow84,,,"I agree that the distinction between, to quote you, &quot;society denying people opportunities directly, and people not taking opportunities that they have because of some self-fulfilling belief&quot; is very important. I also agree that, as you observe, it is important precisely because understanding the causes of some problem should, in a rational world, inform the policies selected to address that problem.<p>The counterpoint I would offer to your statement about the &quot;left wing&quot; analysis of such situations is that, to use similarly broad strokes, the &quot;right&quot; has a tendency, quite strong at times, to completely dismiss the importance, or even existence, of &quot;self-fulfilling beliefs&quot;, and correspondingly prescribes exactly the kind of &quot;just get on with it&quot; solutions that I mentioned before. Their political opponents, still observing the problem, are then bound to highlight that, given that the problem does still exist, and that obvious direct causes can be ruled out (assuming they can), then the &quot;self-fulfilling beliefs&quot; must be important.<p>Although you seem to hold similar opinions to me regarding the importance of understanding these effects and addressing them if they are found to be important, I would suggest that your instincts appear to question whether or not these effects even exist at all. Taking your first paragraph:<p>> It is very typical on the left for a personal account of the experience and psychology of being X to also be a political argument. Even if the author didn&#x27;t intend it that way, it&#x27;s certainly being used in the context of a political argument now. Note the replies by monk_e_boy and rayiner who take the statement on face value and argue that the payoff to education/savings is very small for poor people.<p>This, to me, looks like an implicit rejection of the importance of these &quot;self-fulfilling effects&quot;. By claiming it is political, or is being used in a political way, you appear to be suggesting that her experience is either not real, or is unrepresentative, and is simply being isolated to gain traction for some policy or other. Most importantly, this suggestion appears to be made <i>on the basis that it is unquantifiable experience</i>, rather than from the actual content.<p>Rejecting anecdotal claims is unscientific is reasonable, and you grant that she may not be directly making &quot;claims&quot; herself. What I would caution against is your (apparent) assumption that the use of her experience to highlight an issue (by the editors of the guardian) can be quite safely rejected simply by virtue of the fact that her experience is difficult to quantify. The most appropriate response, it seems to me, is to demand rigorous research on the subject. If, however, I have misunderstood you, and this wasn&#x27;t your intention, then please accept my apology in advance.",1422277473

I look at the world and how systemically fucked up it is for so many people, and feeding the charity machine seems so indirect and ineffective. Although I do acknowledge that charities probably do improve peoples&#x27; lives in a band-aid sense.<p>As old as I am, I&#x27;m still emotionally a teenager and would like to figure out a way to wipe out war and poverty and intolerance.

Which means that inflation would go down, not up.<p>And yes, I would rather have my [savings] account in a hard, non-inflationary currency. On the other hand, I can only earn interest when someone is willing to take a loan in the currency and pay interest on it. And I am not about to take out a loan in a hard currency when perfectly good inflationary currencies are easily at hand. So, you&#x27;re going to have a hard time finding a bank that pays interest on bitcoins. This is why &quot;bad money drives out good&quot;, aka Gresham&#x27;s law.",1388264385

6976548,comment,6976095,6976158,5,0,chipsy,,,"What I think is important about cryptographic assets isn&#x27;t exactly in the economic properties they have now, but in the potential for reforming governance.<p>That is, if people are successfully using a crypto asset for their business, AND they are able to use a power and network infrastructure for this that is difficult enough(not perfect) that government authorities aren&#x27;t successfully applying their &quot;monopoly on force,&quot; then government is now pushed into competition with the crypto-anarchic principles and must find a way to become a &quot;better product,&quot; enough so that people will prefer government money over crypto.<p>How will government come up with a product that is better - in a positive way - than a crypto asset? Government has the authority to issue new centralized currencies. This means that if it truly embraced computing - which it never has to date, having never faced a challenge of that nature - it could program a form of currency that is &quot;smart&quot; and bakes in the policy decisions and taxation currently executed by bureaucracy. It would be made attractive to citizens by building in basic income, as well as the service provisions. The result would be more powerful and more efficient than anything we currently know as government. Cash would still exist as a backup, but the government could discourage its use except in emergency situations.",1388264338

6976523,comment,6974941,6975233,1,0,vbuterin,,,"There are several cryptoanarchist responses to that:<p>1. Some government-like mechanisms should definitely exist on the level of the physical world (this could be anywhere from Rothbardian private law to a concept of private cities to a more moderate vision of a Georgist government that taxes exclusively resources and perhaps even pays out a basic income). What matters is that these governmental mechanisms should/will stay out of trying to restrict human interaction.<p>2. We are already moving into a less materialistic society, and the trend will continue in the future. For myself personally, all of my physical possessions combined have a resale value under $1k and a replacement cost under $2k. If you mug me, you will get a moderately good cell phone, some cash in my wallet and maybe an old laptop, but not anything nearly worth the tiny risk that I or a bystander will be able to overpower you. When all wealth is stored in data or the mind, locked behind passphrases and encryption, physical crime simply becomes not all that interesting.<p>3. Contrary to Oleg&#x27;s post, people&#x27;s online identities should be cleanly separated from their physical identities, and it should be cryptographically difficult to make the mapping from the guy who wrote a bad review of you to the physical person living in a certain city.<p>You can feel free to choose which of these you find more and less convincing; I have my own opinions on the issue and certainly do not represent &quot;the movement&quot; as a whole to any significant extent. But you are correct that the high offense/defense asymmetry characterized by the (cryptoanarchists&#x27; vision of the) internet does heavily rely on existing infrastructure; if this were not true, then we would have been living in a society organized largely along cryptoanarchist lines for the past ten thousand years.",1388264090

Not everyone is going to fit in your life. I don&#x27;t mean that there will be arguments, just that things you find interesting won&#x27;t be interesting to some other people as it would be to some other-other people.

It&#x27;s far better to be interesting yourself, in some specific way, forgo the potential friendships that don&#x27;t &quot;get you&quot;, and cultivate the ones that do.

It&#x27;s better to winnow quality out of quantity.<p>Second, I stopped prioritizing friendship based on length-of-time. Most of the kids I grew up with grew apart in college, as people do, but afterwards we clung to this idea that we were once friends, thus should always be friends. It became a serious issue of clashing ideologies, and I realized that, if we had met today, we would have been much more polite to each other than we had come to be, and we would not be trying to spend a lot of time with each other. This notion of eternal friendship was exactly the reason why we were arguing so much all the time.

People who wish to transfer money using bitcoin do not care about the market price; if they have $1000 USD to send, they buy $1000 USD worth of bitcoins at market price, send them over the network in seconds, and then that value is converted into cash locally.  They don&#x27;t care about the market price, as long as it isn&#x27;t volatile over the short time it takes to move the value.<p>The market price of bitcoin is determined by the number of bitcoin holders who think they will go down in value; as coins gradually transfer to the hands of people who believe they hold long term promise, the market price of &#x27;loose change&#x27; available for transfer will rise; that rise in price will actually _increase_ the use of btc as a transfer mechanism  because it will attract more people seeing BTC as a store of value, which increases the store of bitcoins held for long term positions and thus the market price of BTC, etc. The increase of its usage as a medium of transfer ALSO increases the market price of BTC; that interplay between new value-minded long term investors and new users  of btc as a transfer mechanism is what has been pushing the price up continually. the entrance and exit of speculators in the market is a short term distraction that has the benefit of spreading awareness but the drawback of adding to conception as a bubble.<p>after about the 6th or 7th one of these &#x27;boom and bust&#x27; cycles that triples/quadruples the market price, people will stop seeing this as a &#x27;maybe&#x27; thing, and my guess is that will drive a massive one-time spike in the value.",1388263521

In Smalltalk there is a convention of putting all such methods inside &quot;converting&quot; protocol. For great example of how is this useful you can look at the Collection and it&#x27;s subclasses in Smalltalk - all collections have many &quot;asOtherKindOfCollection&quot; methds, which are either inherited or implemented, depending on a collection.

Cryptocurrencies allow for rule-based monetary systems without the risk of a central bank failing to adhere to its rules prescription.

This is why developed countries do better with discretionary central banks - their economies are too complicated for any known rules systems to work reliably and their central banks trusted enough not to be stupid.<p>I love the future Bitcoin portends - a world of competing and overlapping rules-based and discretionary monetary systems.

Unfortuantely, hoverzoom is immensely popular (it has 977,000 users) so most of your new users will probably have hoverzoom installed.  Which means most of your new users will probably uninstall your extension pretty quickly.<p>Even if most of your new users don&#x27;t use hoverzoom, the ones who do will probably complain loudly on Reddit.  So it seems likely that whenever someone says &quot;Use this AutoGfy extension, it&#x27;s awesome!&quot;  someone else will chime in with &quot;Be careful, it broke hoverzoom and might break other things too.&quot;<p>It&#x27;ll probably be a pain to figure out how to get gfycat to play nicely with hoverzoom -- hoverzoom is designed for gif playback, not html5 video playback -- but you&#x27;ll have to find a way, otherwise your extension will have a tough time getting users.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting situation... your extension&#x27;s popularity seems to be at the mercy of whether you can figure out a clever way to get hoverzoom to load html5 video, or whether you can bribe the hoverzoom developer into adding html5 video playback.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m rooting for you.  Good luck!<p>EDIT:  It looks like gfycat is causing trouble for mobile users:  <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1tvgs9/every_reddit_fad_in_history/cebvxgv\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1tvgs9/every_reddit_f...</a> ... so gfycat may not even become popular unless they somehow fix the slow loading times on mobile.<p>EDIT2:  Wow, as of last week, Reddit now hates hoverzoom because they&#x27;re convinced it contains malware. <a href=\"http://nt.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1ttjwq/ice_cream_trickery/cebe9ic\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nt.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1ttjwq/ice_cream_tricke...</a><p>(It seems like hoverzoom&#x27;s &quot;malware&quot; javascript was merely code to gather anonymous usage statistics, but for some reason all of Reddit believes it&#x27;s malware.)<p>So maybe hoverzoom doesn&#x27;t matter after all.

But this is actually a fantastic opportunity, because you can contact the Imagus devs and convince them to add support for gfycat.  It&#x27;d be a tactical advantage for them to do so, because at that point Imagus will offer more features than Hoverzoom.

HTTP 404 Not Found is not meant to be thrown in case the user is not authenticated. There are more relevant, more correct status codes for that, like 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden, or heck, in case of classic websites, a 302 redirect to a login page is in order. So you&#x27;re basically giving broken examples and calling them &quot;<i>magic</i>&quot;, but the examples are obviously broken, the first one in terms of API design, the second one in terms of functionality.<p>I really do understand your hint. But the examples you&#x27;re giving are bad because they rely on totally non-obvious mutable state that&#x27;s passed implicitly. This is indeed &quot;<i>magic</i>&quot;, however it has nothing to do with syntactic sugar.<p>Btw, in Scala 2.10, thanks to String interpolation, you can also construct route-matchers such as this on [1]:<p><pre><code>    case POST(p&quot;/api/calls/$name/&quot;) =>\n</code></pre>\nDoesn&#x27;t work by default, you really have to build your own stuff for this to work (see the linked example). Or if you want to throw in regular expressions, you can either do this:<p><pre><code>    case POST(p&quot;/api/calls/${Integer(id)}/&quot;) =>\n</code></pre>\nOr you can have like a mini-DSL with regular expressions built-in:<p><pre><code>    case POST(p&quot;/api/calls/$id<\\d+>/?&quot;) => // note the optional ending slash\n</code></pre>\nYeah, you can do this. And it&#x27;s certainly much nicer to me, more flexible and you can also make it faster than pattern-matching on Lists, as in your Unfiltered example. Is this magic? I don&#x27;t see a local, mutable and implicitly-passed context, so for me it doesn&#x27;t qualify.<p>Also, whenever I see &quot;2.days&quot; or &quot;4.kilobytes&quot; in Scala code, it&#x27;s certainly nicer than seeing &quot;172800 /* 2 days in secs <i>/&quot; or &quot;4096 /</i> 4 kb */&quot;. Given that these are statically type-checked extension functions that do not modify the original Int type and that do not rely on some mutable local state passed implicitly, is this magic?

I&#x27;m a white male who learned to code when I was about 12 years old, at an NYIT summer program that my parents paid for. My high school had enough coding classes (including AP) that I could take one every year. My parents could afford to buy me a computer and they and others didn&#x27;t stigmatize me for spending hours on it. I don&#x27;t need White Boys Code and neither do white-boys-in-general.<p>I guess this is a lot of stuffy white dude HNers&#x27; first interaction with a little thing called identity politics. Surely no white bystander questioned why the Black Panthers weren&#x27;t called the People Panthers (and they did provide a plethora of community services, they weren&#x27;t just a militia group[0]); we&#x27;re at a time where, after black radical politics was systematically destroyed by the US government and police , white-people-in-general sort of exude this attitude of &quot;you seem to have won [read: lost], stop rioting [i.e. Trayvon] and trying to organize around identity because we live in a post-racial society now and any mention of race, or exclusion of whiteness, is Racism.&quot;<p>But actually: “Just as the capitalist system is not a capitalist plot, so racial oppression is not the work of “racists.” It is maintained by the principal institutions of society, including the schools (which define “excellence”), the labor market (which defines “employment”), the legal system (which defines “crime”), the welfare system (which defines “poverty”), the medical industry (which defines “health”), and the family (which defines “kinship”). Many of these institutions are administered by people who would be offended if accused of complicity with racial oppression.” (that&#x27;s Noel Ignatiev).<p>So, the ultimate solution for those who recognize race as a force of <i>institutional</i> violence and marginalization (rather than an outdated idea, because hey explicitly racist speech and laws are impolite now!) would be to dismantle those exact systems and rebuild without any idea of whiteness at all -- &quot;white skin would have as little social importance as big feet.&quot; But if you try to do that, at best you&#x27;re lonely, and at worst you&#x27;re killed (Obama can assassinate terrorists on US soil, remember).<p>So Black Girls Code is doing what can be done right now to help a severely marginalized, invisible group (you have to remember the experience of young girls in the US [1][2][3]) get into a field that is basically guaranteed employment if they develop interest and go with it long enough.<p>If you&#x27;re white, especially a white guy, no one cares about your Very Reasonable And Logical opinion or how this makes you Very Uncomfortable on the Internet.<p>[0] <a href""http://www.stanford.edu/group/blackpanthers/programs.shtm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.stanford.edu/group/blackpanthers/programs.shtml</a><p>[1] <a href""http://reelgirl.com/2013/11/im-not-a-pilot-im-a-pilots-wife-says-3-yr-old-girl"" rel""nofollo"">http://reelgirl.com/2013/11/im-not-a-pilot-im-a-pilots-wife-...</a><p>[2] <a href""http://www.metafilter.com/121190/teenage-girls-they-havent-been-living-theyve-been-performin"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.metafilter.com/121190/teenage-girls-they-havent-b...</a><p>[3] <a href""http://sodisarmingdarling.tumblr.com/post/34106027759/what-its-like-being-a-teen-gir"" rel""nofollo"">http://sodisarmingdarling.tumblr.com/post/34106027759/what-i...</a>",1388262406

This is because it is subject to huge increases in demand as it spreads to more places across the globe. It is not hindered by any export controls or borders, which means it can &quot;infect&quot; whole nations/societies/cultures in lumps, as we saw recently with China, sparking a huge jump in price.<p>But eventually everyone will have heard of BitCoin, and I believe BitCoin&#x27;s growth will slow down, and its curve will flatten and look more stable. The more people have BitCoin the less small groups of individuals, or even countries, can influence its price.<p>But look at the growth of vendors who are accepting BitCoin over the same period. For the same reason it doesn&#x27;t make a whole lot of reason to spend BitCoin during this growth phase, it does make sense to <i>accept</i> BitCoins. And even though most merchants don&#x27;t wish to speculate with their revenue, even keeping a &quot;float&quot; of currency in BitCoin could be profitable, and so it is reasonable that merchants and vendors might want to accept BitCoin even though not a whole lot people are spending them these days. That can only increase BitCoin&#x27;s value as a currency in the long run.<p>If it was unwise or wise to spend something based on its changing value, no matter how slowly, then it would be rational for me to want to spend all my dollars for goods and services today because the dollar value is going down. But the US dollar isn&#x27;t depreciating at a fast enough rate for it to be rational for me to spend all of my dollars today, right? This is because the currency is inflating at a pretty slow percentage rate. A slow inflation rate is not all that different from a slow deflation rate.<p>It all depends on what will ultimately be the rate of deflation of BitCoin. If it is sufficiently slow(1% annually, for instance) it will be useful as a currency. If it is all over the place, it won&#x27;t be.",1388262252

6976334,comment,6975533,6975533,3,0,moron4hire,,,"There is a bit of a chicken-or-the-egg issue with these sorts of programs that has always bothered me. I&#x27;ve had some experience with attempts to address diversity in subcultures, and while I agree with the goal, the methods have always rubbed me raw.<p>The problem is, they tend to always be ran by the majority group to try to &quot;give a helping hand&quot; to the minority group. It&#x27;s kind of a patronizing position. I didn&#x27;t need a &quot;helping hand&quot; to become a programmer, and women are smart enough that they don&#x27;t need a &quot;helping hand&quot; either. And they won&#x27;t want it.<p>Think of it this way. There is an extremely similar situation in teaching, where there aren&#x27;t a lot of young males going into the field. I have had some interest in becoming a certified teacher, having done some semi-formal class programs of various types, but I know for myself I would never go to a &quot;Get Men to Teach&quot; type of program. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be treated special. I would just want to go through the normal program and be treated no more differently, either positively or negatively, than anyone else. In addition, a lot of people don&#x27;t like to be told by outsiders that they&#x27;re doing something &quot;wrong&quot;, or that they should do something differently. Someone coming to a programmer conference and espousing how great it would be if more of us got into teaching is terribly unlikely to be convincing. I think most people are probably like this, and I think that&#x27;s probably why, after two solid decades of &quot;get more X to Y&quot;, we haven&#x27;t really seen an increase in Xs Ying.<p>And while there is a lot of blame to be placed at the feet of the in-crowd treating the out-crowd poorly, and thus driving them away, I came to a greater realization that the problem was more that the in-crowd just never socializes with the out-crowd, period. I have very few friends who are teachers, but of the few that I have, I know most of their friends are teachers. I have a lot of programmer friends. It goes all the way back to college. I didn&#x27;t know any teaching students, even though I went to one of the biggest teaching universities in the country, and we tended to have a very dull view of the few we even came into contact with. They tended to have a very dull view of us. The business students were the same. The art students were the same. Hell, even the physics students were the same. We were all compartmentalized from each other in our respective departments.<p>Then you go to work and the programmers are in one cube farm over here, and the accountants are in another, and the designers are separate. We&#x27;ve managed to create a culture that sees the segregation of people by skillset as a natural thing, and never question it.<p>And then you get companies saying &quot;we can&#x27;t hire qualified female programmers. They just don&#x27;t apply!&quot;. Frankly, I don&#x27;t think open-application is any sort of reliable way to find a decent employee. The only employees that I&#x27;ve known to stick around for a long time were ones that came with recommendations from current employees. You see it all the time, &quot;the importance of networking&quot;. &quot;But we haven&#x27;t done anything to keep them away!&quot; And that is mostly true (though it is important to recognize that there are several instances where active prejudice is still a problem, I think this is a much bigger problem). But employees are people, and trying to &quot;hire more of <adjective>&quot; is treating them like checkboxes, not people. Well, no wonder you don&#x27;t see more female programmers, because most existing programmers are already male and they don&#x27;t socialize with many women, period, say nothing about ones that would be interested in programming.<p>Anyway, my point is, I don&#x27;t think these sort of &quot;Xs working to get not-Xs to do more Y&quot; are ever going to work, so long as the Xs mostly socialize with Xs. You want to find more black designers? Make more friends of black people. You want to find more female programmers? Make more friends of women. They are out there. While you personally may have not done anything to drive them away, you&#x27;re also not doing anything to make them a whole part of your life, either. It will always be the case  that men will be over represented in programming so long as men are the gate keepers into programming organizations and men do not do more to socialize with women as peers--with the complete reverse situation being true for women and men in teaching. And while you personally didn&#x27;t ask to be the de facto gate keeper to your industry, the state of things is that you are. Tough shit. Play the hand you&#x27;re dealt.<p>EDIT: long-story short, &quot;Get more X to Y&quot; is still treating the Xs as &quot;others&quot;. These types of programs perpetuate that cycle. The answer is to eliminate the otherness of whatever property we&#x27;re concerned about today.",1388262232

They always say it&#x27;s a pile of garbage and it&#x27;s bound to self destruct and swallow the earth in the process. However, PHP trudges on with some very large projects and sites under it&#x27;s belt.. and novice developers will almost never notice a problem with it. Experts can be wrong.<p>So yes, bitcoin has it&#x27;s issues if you analyze each aspect of it. But maybe if you zoom out and take an overview it might start to make sense how all the parts get together and even with flaws with each sub-aspect <i>it just might work</i>.",1388261899

I agree that that is processing, but the data&#x27;s already structured in a known way and the transformations performed on it are relatively simple. The question to my mind here really does make Moores law the important thing. I know that youtube does try to check for copyrighted content - but equally they&#x27;re not particularly good at it even there.<p>Unfortunately I can&#x27;t really visualise exactly what you&#x27;re talking about in my head in terms of what you want to do to the data - face-recognition would presumably be part of it, as would voice to text, and then you&#x27;d want to check that against databases of stored signatures. Possibly you could make the task vastly less complex by using other data around it to limit your database queries, but still. That&#x27;s not a simple thing. Against individuals of interest, I could totally see it being done, but everyone seems very wasteful - I&#x27;m not sure how the small amounts of evidence I think you&#x27;d get would justify the costs unless costs became very low.<p>If we&#x27;re looking at something like a 20 magnitude increase in computing power over the next fifty years or so, (and similar increases in access speed and so on,) then all those concerns just sort of vanish away into the sea of massive power. ^_^",1388261380

(prior to the discovery of controlled nuclear fission) Of course it had value but we couldn&#x27;t use it without accessing it and tapping into it somehow.<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s value is closely coupled with its utility as a medium of exchange, which is based solely off some pretty excellent technology and principles.<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t think its current value in terms of USD/Euros/etc. is necessarily linked well to it&#x27;s current utility. However, there is value in being able to transfer something (a bitcoin or parts of it..) that no one else can transfer to someone across the world securely and almost instantly with little to no centralized control.<p>This ability is what places a floor on its value, whatever that hypothetical floor may be.<p>This is what excites the &#x27;technical people&#x27; he mentions in his article. I don&#x27;t expect non-technical people to &#x27;get it&#x27; immediately, but people will get it, eventually. No one understood why email was important in the beginning either.",1388261034

The reasoning is &quot;that is a limitation/flaw in the firmware of the single router that we provide (and you cannot use your own, or meddle with it). The company behind that product might correct this mistake early 2014 and we will upgrade your routers firmware (you cannot) when we get around. Just.. unplug it every three days for now&quot;.\nThat is the official statement, confirmed several times. The manufacturer (AVM) confirmed that they know about this issue and are working on a fix, but didn&#x27;t want to commit to the early 2014 part.. Meanwhile the ISP gives you no choice to refuse dual stack lite and have a stable internet connection..<p>Technology: UPNP might be a way to open ports, but that works for IPv4 as well, no? I mean, the benefits of IPv6 lie elsewhere? A global address (for a time.. my prefix changes whenever my ISP likes to do that.

It took me at least a year before I really felt comfortable and maybe another year before Windows felt harder to use.<p>Perhaps you already know this, but I found it really hard to use Finder until I stumbled upon the hotkeys, which seem nonsensical when coming from Windows:<p><pre><code>  Cmd-Down/Cmd-O - open\n  Cmd-Up         - go up\n  Cmd-C          - place item on clipboard\n  Cmd-V          - copy item on clipboard\n  Cmd-Opt-V      - move item on clipboard\n  Return/Enter   - rename\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, to cut in OS X, you must do a Cmd-C followed by Cmd-Opt-V (as opposed to Ctrl-X, Ctrl-V), the reasoning being that you can choose to copy or move at the destination. I must have used the Mac for 5 or 6 years before I found that out.<p>I also use an app called Moom to mimic some basic tiling window functions. I have hotkeys bound to move a window to a quarter, third, half, or full screen. This is nice for setting up MacVim and iTerm side-by-side, or two or four Finder windows. Alfred (application launcher) includes some functionality to make working with files easier. Mine is set so Cmd-Opt-\\ will pull the currently selected file(s) in the frontmost Finder window, and then you can perform an “Open With…”, or Copy/Move the file (you can just start typing the letters of the destination without browsing to it). Shortcat, Witch, Little Snitch, KeyRemap4MacBook are also fantastic.<p>As for Page-Up and Page-Down, I tried to remember that Fn-<i>Up</i> is bound to Page-<i>Up</i>, and Fn-<i>Down</i> is bound to Page-<i>Down</i>, and therefore Home/End are bound to Fn-Left/Right. It becomes second nature after enough use.<p>I agree that some of these things should be built in, but I think any operating system is going to have these kinds of issues. There’s no way to cater to everyone. I just wish some of these modifications to OS X felt a little less… hacky…<p>(edit: formatting issues)",1388260900

Whether you are working on a space shuttle, an airliner, a nuclear power plant, or an iPhone app, you are a human. Humans make mistakes. Humans overlook things.<p>So how do we engineer really complex systems with hundreds or thousands of lives at stake to an exacting standard - knowing that the engineers are human?<p>The answer is to build a process that catches mistakes. I don't think software <i>engineering</i> has really caught up with mechanical <i>engineering</i> in terms of process.<p>I know a lot of guys who love to wrench on cars. They swap parts, add horsepower, change out the suspension, etc. They can build a really fast car. But that's not mechanical engineering. They are mechanics.<p>In a lot of ways writing software is like that. Glue together some libraries and APIs the same way a tuner supercharges an engine. But that isn't engineering.<p>Obviously we don't need the rigour of the space shuttle to make an iPhone app, but if your application calls for that complexity (or your budget/liability is large), then you need to bring in the process mechanical engineers have been using for the last 60 years.<p>That means multiple people checking all the code. That means a well planned out arrangement/architecture. That means testing the individual parts thoroughly and the whole system together. And it means very specific configuration managament of every dependency.<p>It's not impossible, it's just not the willy-nilly <i>fun</i> part of hacking stuff together. It's the ugly paperwork inducing lame part of working in a big company. But that process if done correctly helps catch mistakes.",1336651087

Engineering is the one true way! Execution is paramount! Reddit, here's a picture of my cute cat!""<p>It's not black and white (the cat, or the matter in hand here).<p>As a community, we all nurture fragile ideas. Some of them are big, bold ideas (like beating Google at search), but almost all of them are very fragile. People shouldn't labour on in delusion, but if you say the wrong thing to the wrong dispirited guy who has been thinking about a brilliant idea for three months, then you're going to harm rather than help. And you can help without investing your asshole consulting time.<p>Nobody needs more assholes reflecting on their status within the startup landscape (""I'm a scarce resource"") and denigrating people who presumably are coming to you to share ideas they're excited about (""available markers"" whatever that means  ""and business monkeys""), whilst simultaneously insinuating that the work engineers do is somehow more vital or worthy (""I have [to] make an investment and [do] actual work while you played [sic] around with excel spreadsheets and send [sic] out a few press releases?"").<p>Engineering is vitally important. But that alone does not encompass execution. An MVP (or a P) is the sum total of the amount of sheer thought that has gone into it from everyone who has worked on it or cares about it. Your asshole consulting code doesn't mean anything if it's a feature which nobody needs. A great software engineer contributes code and creative ideas which push a project on. A non-technical co-founder should protect their engineering team and contribute creative ideas which push a project on, whilst doing the grunt work required to push the project on (pay your taxes. Find an office. Do an angel raise. All the crappy ephemeral stuff that goes with a new startup). But most importantly they are there to care and nurture fragile ideas.<p>The thing which I sincerely loved about this article was the last paragraph. And it's probably a charge which could be leveraged at this comment, but you should have reconsidered your entire post around the final paragraph. Instead of making it a polemic against curious people with ideas who want to share them with you, and telling them just why you're not interested in working with anyone ever, you should have helped people be more persuasive with those ideas in talking to highly technically literate individuals.<p>Yes, there are countless people who believe they have ideas which can change the world. Yes, there are fewer engineers who can help them get there. What these ideas people need is someone who is prepared to help them realise they are at step 1 of 1.5m, and the most critical thing to do right now is get to step 2. That takes five seconds. It takes a pertinent question. It takes making them stop and think for a second. It doesn't take a list of vaguely offensive barbs and generalisations.<p>Context: I am a semi-technically literate cofounder (HTML/CSS/JS, competent PHP).",1336650832

I assume that this is because our visual cortex is tuned to recognise physical objects that do actions, not visual representations of actions themselves. We see a depiction of a hammer and know that its for driving nails, but its hard to depict driving nails without depicting a hammer. You could presumably do it (i'm not a graphic designer) but you're making people work harder to understand your depiction.<p>The problem is that sometimes changes in the world result in the recognisable physical object no-longer being recognisable and/or physical.<p>This can happen we make an action abstract (""save to floppy"" becomes ""save to cloud storage""), virtualise an action (""pick up phone and talk"" becomes ""make skype call using laptop""), or merge a once-external object into a multi-function object (""save to floppy"" becomes ""save to internal disk"").

And it's clear that on the business side people work hard too if they are going to be successful and they too have a TVM problem.<p>The biggest failure I see tech people make is not properly communicating the real level of effort a project takes.  In a room full of techs if we talk about a problem we all have a reasonable understanding of how hard it is.  We might be off a bit in our estimates but in general we understand the difference in effort of various proposals.<p>When in a room of business people with no domain expertise we assume they understand what it's like to spend 100's if not 1,000's of hours working on a technical project.  They don't understand it any more then most techs understand how hard it is to setup a company, get the business registered, shareholder agreements written, contracts developed, taxes handled etc.<p>That issue however is a failure on both parties part, techs have to learn to own their half of the ""assumption"" problem.  They need to clearly articulate how much work something is going to take and convert that effort into real dollars and timelines.<p>True story a very famous musician friend of mine and I were talking one day and I asked him ""How long did it take you to write that song XXX"" (very famous song) and he said ""Hmm a couple days here and there then in the studio.."" we both agreed it must have been maybe a 60 hour commitment.  Then he asked me about a project I had just finished with a major car manufacturer and I said ""Oh that was 6 man years of effort"".  He asked me ""What is a man year?"" and of course I tried to explain in lay terms what it's like to have someone at a keyboard for 2,000 hours and do that with six people.  He was blown away at the effort he literally would bring it up in future conversations for years when we would chat on various topics.<p>In tech we take for granted that we work on labor scales that are massive and our failure to explain that to other people only makes the ""startup conundrum"" worse.",1336649576

However I found this article difficult to read. It was thought provoking though, so I just did a quick fly by edit.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>NO, I WONT BE YOUR TECHNICAL CO-FOUNDER<p>Hackers are becoming more and more like VCs, they often have to say ""no"". Last summer, just before the 500 demo day I attended an event which required me to fill in company on name tag. As I was there just to help out Zerply for less than 2 months I didnt feel adequate enough use their name. I didnt bother to write my consulting companies either as obviously it wouldnt have said anything. I decided to go for Hacker. I dont think I would have been forced to listen to as many pitches had I chosen writing checks.<p>Every week I get approached by someone with a game changing idea. All they need is someone to execute it. Hey, Ive heard you are good at IT stuff, lets start up!. Well, no.<p>I dont know you.<p>Startups and babies have one thing in common; you dont do them with someone you just met. We will have to work together for years, sometimes 24 hours a day. Chances are we just met and you just handed me your card or at least I dont know you well. How could I trust you with part of my business?<p>There are thousands of issues that can ruin the relationship between startup founders, many of which can be foreseen. It might not even directly be your fault. Perhaps you have an over-controlling spouse that wants you home by 6 every day? If thats the case, forgot about startups in general.<p>Im not passionate about the subject.<p>Passion is the fuel that powers startups, it helps get through tough times and get things done. My passion is games. It isn't a hard and fast rule, but unless your idea has something to do with games I probably wont be interested. People often approach me with a random idea they had, but without the spark in their eyes. Thats a sure sign of approaching failure and Im not going to buy first class ticket on the Titanic.<p>You expect me to invest at least 60 000<p>Its reasonable to for MVP to take 6 months. We could release an earlier version, just to be ashamed of it, but 6 months is probable. If we consider just 8 hour work days 5 days a week it totals about 120 000 by my normal consulting rate.<p>Time is money; why should I invest mine in your idea? And if I do, why should I accept only 50% or even less of the equity? After all, I have made an investment of actual work while you played around with excel spreadsheets and sent out a few press releases? Sarcasm aside, during first few months of startup development, hackers are doing all the work and taking all the risk. If we fail fast you have lost almost nothing whereas I have lost months of intense work.<p>Your are easily replaceable.<p>Lets face it  good hackers are scarce resource. Thats why you are talking to me. However conferences, meetups and other places where startup industry players gathers to escape the daylight are filled with available marketers and business monkeys.<p>Only thing you have is your network. As a business guy in a startup I expect you to have Barack Obama as a 2nd level LinkedIn connection and Zuckys number on speed dial. Well, anyway much wider network than I have. If you dont  I probably dont need you.<p>There are exceptions of course, people who have already proved themselves, but thats an entirely different ballgame. Experience in other fields does not matter  even if they come from tech industry, startups are nothing like your average business plan.<p>I dont know the IT stuff<p>I dont know anything about construction, medicine or farming. Common denominator here is, Im not planning to do business in any of these fields. If you say outright that you know nothing about IT, it means you wont respect nor understand my work, will set unreasonable goals and probably wont be pleasant to work with. At least get some basic knowledge of the technical side if you want any hacker to take you seriously. And lose the darn tie.<p>How to make me consider it.<p>I can think of two cases where I have seriously considered taking the role and might actually do it at some point.<p>One of them was a guy approaching me with an idea for a piece of software he desperately needed himself. Not desperately, but enough to invest money into it. He was straightforward from the beginning  he knew the industry, knew the problem and could provide the first clients and testers. Later on he hoped to sell it to some bigger player  not change the world/cure AIDS or eliminate hunger. It was barely a startup as he wasnt hunting millions, just a quick cash and to scratch his own itch.<p>Second case was a team of 2 developers asking me to be the third. They had a better business model and market research than most MBAs that have asked me to join. They also acknowledged that the task was so big they would benefit from having another set of hands. I can respect that.<p>What did these two cases have that others haven't? First of all, I knew the people for some time, one of them for about 10 years. Secondly they had well defined goals and business models. You are not Steve Jobs, you do not have a reality disorientation field. Vision is not enough. I want to see numbers and research before I decide to make the investment of my time and effort.<p>I am considering making separate business cards for people who want me to be their technical co-founder. They will only have a QR code on them  to this article.",1336649575

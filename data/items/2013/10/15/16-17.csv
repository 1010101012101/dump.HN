6554540,comment,6553767,6554134,2,0,smoyer,,,"I&#x27;m not sure I believe Spring and JavaEE are as compatible as some would lead you to believe.  CDI and JPA are the official implementations of dependency injection and ORM persistence, but they overlap with other functions in Spring and Hibernate.  Components in JavaEE are POJOs or MBeans and they&#x27;re injected based on qualifiers and rules in a configuration file.  Guice and Spring both allow you to wire components together, but you can easily get conflict between their injection and the CDI injection.<p>The compile time sanity checking is still doing type checking, and to a degree you&#x27;re correct ... there will be run-time exceptions if CDI can&#x27;t find any instances of an object (likely an interface) to inject or if there is more than one that matches.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d want it to randomly pick one.<p>If you code to the CDI and JPA specifications, you can plug in Hibernate and Weld as your implementations of the frameworks.  If you plug in Hibernate and Weld, then use their non-standard extensions you can indeed find irregularities.",1381856257

6554536,comment,6553367,6553544,7,0,lemmsjid,,,"Count me as one of the unhealthily sympathetic.  That said, different people and/or cultures have more or less tolerance for argument.  One person&#x27;s &#x27;spirited debate&#x27; can be another&#x27;s &#x27;flamewar&#x27;.<p>Now, preface my following comments with the fact that I don&#x27;t have data to back them up, so really you can take or leave what I&#x27;m about to say--if it resonates, then maybe I&#x27;m on to something--if it doesn&#x27;t, then maybe I&#x27;m just projecting.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed is a pattern that a dispassionate article about the plight of women in the tech industry will survive, but an article by a woman who is actively angry about being harassed will get a large number of angry, devaluing comments and will disappear very quickly.<p>On a positive note, this reflects a culture that values a level of scientific detachment, and also a recognition of the fact that Internet arguments can get very circular and ugly and can ultimately destroy an online community if left unchecked.<p>The problem is that this pattern also belies a cultural devaluation of the role of anger in combating trauma.  Where trauma exists, anger will exist.  Angry people are not always fair and balanced--in fact the state of the emotion actively undermines such a thing.  Anger and scientific detachment are quite antithetical, because an angry person is very much inside of the thing they&#x27;re supposed to be detached about--and it&#x27;s hurting them.<p>So when a woman who is traumatized writes an article out of anger, there is inherent value in that, even if the anger behind the article makes it one-sided, because in the end that person is (bravely, in the face of the inevitable harassment that will come of it) bearing witness to what is (in my own experience) a major problem in the industry, a problem that is not only hurting people but limiting the talent pool significantly.",1381856240

They work because the number of people actually reading the new page is vastly smaller than the number of posts being submitted.<p>I actually did a semi-controlled experiment a while back and submitted a series of blog posts I was writing, all on the same topic.  There were seven of them all together.  On four of them, I asked a small number (a single digit) of people to upvote the story.  For the other three, I didn&#x27;t.  All four of the gamed stories ended up near the top of the home page.  The other three didn&#x27;t get a single upvote.  If you do the math you will find that this is a statistically significant result.  (And I have since submitted many other stories.  Not a single one has gotten more than one upvote.)<p>The trick is to get enough upvotes early enough to get onto the home page.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, it just has to be fast.  Once you&#x27;re on the home page, people actually pay attention and you get a lot of organic traffic.  But your odds of getting off the new page at all unless you game the system are extremely small.<p>Some changes that would help the situation:<p>1.  Provide some incentive for people to read the new page.  I&#x27;m not sure what this incentive would be, but the fact that very few people read the new page is the nub of the problem.<p>2.  Incorporate the submitter&#x27;s karma into the ranking of the new page to allow stories submitted by high-karma users to stay there longer.  Depending on the time of day, a story typically has between 30 minutes and an hour before it drops off the new page, after which it will surely never be noticed.<p>3.  Don&#x27;t start the timer on a story when it is submitted.  Instead, start it only after some time has elapsed (at least a few hours) or it gets its first upvote.<p>4.  Make it cost something (like a karma point) to submit a story.  Throttle the cost so that submitting a large number of stories in a short period of time costs more.",1381855841

We are never invited to wonder whether (and it is hard to imagine that) they might have a good motive for any of their actions. Bernard is a sadist from word one. Stilson is a bully.  Peter is a psychopath.  Bonzo is consumed by jealousy and hatred.<p><i>Card thus labors long and hard in Enders Game to create a situation where we are not allowed to judge any of his defined-as-good characters morality by their actions.</i>  The same destructive act that would condemn a bad person, when performed by a good person, does not implicate the actor, and in fact may be read as a sign of that persons virtue.<p>The doctrine that the morality of an action is solely determined by the actors motive rests on a significant assumption:  that the good always know what their motives are, and are never moved to do things for selfish reasons while yet thinking themselves moved by virtue. Ender has perfect knowledge of his own motives and the motives of others. Ender never suspects himself of doing other than what he thinks himself to be doing, and indeed, in Speaker for the Dead he makes a career of delivering faultless moral judgments of other people.<p>---------<p>As I understand the argument, Ender gets a pass and the &quot;evil&quot; characters don&#x27;t.<p>Re: the Hitler comparison, I don&#x27;t know enough about Hitler or Ender&#x27;s Game to make a detailed response, but why would that many parallels exist, to the detail and degree that they do if it was unintentional?

To my mind, they haven&#x27;t challenged that administration sufficiently on drones, surveillance, budget, wars, Guantanamo bay, etc. They have published critical articles but have also published many apologias for the gov. position, and on Snowden for example their coverage has been more notable by its absence from the front page than by its presence.

How will that impact memory usage? I couldn&#x27;t tell just by reading the docs.<p>Finally, the stream itself is actually the easiest part (other than the power law problem). Production systems need monitoring, along with some kind of recommendation system for getting users connected to each other.

Still, I want them out there:<p>1) I, too, feel that Ruby is no longer as fashionable as it used to be. I do not think this to be much of a problem and more like the natural way fashions work. But I still think the effect can be observed. It was not long ago that I learned about a cool new project written in Ruby here on HN on a weekly basis. These days, it has become a rare occurence.<p>2) It is a fact that the &quot;cool kids&quot; have moved on. But there is not the one big new thing. Rather, people who were popular in the Ruby world 5 years ago use Scala, Clojure, Node.js, Go and a few other things these days.<p>3) Still, Rails seems to be very popular with startups. Maybe not with the ones that are highly technical. But many of those just trying to get a mvp out there seem to default to rails these days.<p>4) I love Ruby. I used to love learning new programming languages. But ever since writing Ruby code on a daily basis, other languages most often fail to attract me. And I no longer look at technical benefits. Instead I take a look at the syntax and most often I am annoyed. Ruby has this effect on _some_ people, but not on others. For those who do not care about Ruby&#x27;s aesthetics, there is probably little to keep them from trying out other languages.<p>5) There is little in the list of features on x.rubini.us that I disagree with. But at the same time, there is nothing I ever missed. Also, I am not convinced that all of those issues can or should be solved on the interpreter level.<p>6) Instead of a list of features, I would love to see a list of the kinds of applications that would benefit from those. I am not convinced that Node.js-style network services should be the future of Ruby.",1381854330

The discussion has barely started and Godwin&#x27;s Law has already been proved true.<p>Still, I figured I would at least read through the articles you listed, but they lost me pretty quick too. From the article by Kessel:<p><pre><code>    The novel repeatedly tells us that Ender is morally spotless; though he ultimately takes on guilt for the extermination of the alien buggers, his assuming this guilt is a gratuitous act. [...] In this Card argues that the morality of an act is based solely on the intentions of the person acting.\n</code></pre>\nAlready it seems the author of the article has read a different book than the Ender&#x27;s Game I read. Ender is not &quot;excused&quot; from the guilt of his actions because his intentions were good, he is excused because he did not know that the war he was fighting was real-life. He was told, and had every reason to believe that they were exercises, a game. His teachers spent a lot of effort to maintain this deception because they understood that if Ender knew it was real he would not kill like they wanted him to. By the author&#x27;s logic we are all guilty of murder when we play violent video games.<p>The very next reference to an actual scene from the book is wrong again:<p><pre><code>    On the very first page of the novel an adult lies to Ender about something that is going to hurt him:  the doctor removing the surgically implanted monitor that Ender has worn while being evaluated by the IE training agency swears that the removal wont hurt a bit.4  But in the event it is excruciating. \n</code></pre>\nThe author implies that the adult purposefully lies to Ender and knowingly inflict pain beyond what is normal for a doctor&#x27;s visit. First: children learn quickly that when adults say &quot;This isn&#x27;t going to hurt a bit&quot; they are usually lying, as it will hurt a bit. So this white lie is a very relate-able experience for children, not &quot;relentless, undeserved torment&quot; as the author states one sentence before. The doctor certainly did not expect it to be severe pain:<p><pre><code>    &quot;It&#x27;s designed to be removed. Without infection, without damage. But there&#x27;ll be some tickling, and some people say they have a feeling of something missing. You&#x27;ll keep looking around for something. Something you were looking for, but you can&#x27;t find it, and you can&#x27;t remember what it was. So I&#x27;ll tell you. It&#x27;s the monitor you&#x27;re looking for, and it isn&#x27;t there. In a few days that feeling will pass.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhen Ender experience <i>severe</i> pain as a result, the doctor is almost as surprised as Ender. He is unprepared for the violence of Ender&#x27;s pain, is obviously upset at how much pain Ender has endured, and is upset with himself about it:<p><pre><code>    The doctor was trembling; his voice shook as he spoke. &quot;They leave these things in the kids for three years, what do they expect? We could have switched him off, do you realize that? We could have unplugged his brain for all time. [...] Could have unplugged him forever. I don&#x27;t have the brains of a bugger.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nBut notice that he does not express any misgivings about it until after Ender has his violent reaction. Surely he has never seen this reaction before or he would have been more prepared to deal with it.<p>Already the author&#x27;s arguments are resting on very shaky readings of the source text, but I&#x27;ll keep going a little further.<p>His next several paragraphs focus on further examples of how Card subjects Ender to &quot;relentless, undeserved torment&quot; with the implication that this is done simply to make the reader sympathetic to Ender. Here are some excerpts of his examples:<p><pre><code>    When Ender is not being lied to by authorities, he is being bullied. [...]\n</code></pre>\nFrom where I sit, this is is very common in schools. Kids are lied to by authority figures and bullies in schools act with impunity regularly. Sure, this is making Ender out to be a sympathetic character for many kids, but not because he is being subjected to extreme, unusual torture, but because he is facing things they face everyday in real life.<p><pre><code>    The family offers no haven from assault. [...]\n</code></pre>\nAgain, this form of &quot;relentless, undeserved torment&quot; is sadly not atypical.<p><pre><code>    Yet, for reasons that are never made clear, Ender never tells his parents; he learns early to hide his fear and hurt. [...]\n</code></pre>\nAgain not atypical.<p><pre><code>    One might ask where Enders parents or teachers are when Ender is physically assaulted.  This question reveals a second mechanism Card uses to generate sympathy:  in Enders Game, adults or authority are never there to protect. \n</code></pre>\nAgain, not atypical. In fact, this is a key point in the book. Ender is being manipulated to believe he will always have to solve his own problems. I find it hard to believe Card is sneakily trying to manipulate the reader into feeling sympathetic for Ender when he tells the reader about this directly in the book.<p>The author of the article seems to be trying to make the point that Ender was morally culpable for his actions regardless of his intention of the circumstances. At this point I think he is trying to set the groundwork for the argument that Card is purposefully manipulating the reader into being so sympathetic to Ender as a character that we are willing to forgive him for his crimes. So far the author&#x27;s biased treatment of the source has biased me against his article to such a degree that I do not know if I can continue reading with an open mind. His argument as I understand it so far seems to have trivial flaws. Are we always responsible for the results of our actions, even when we are purposefully manipulated into circumstances where we have been deceived about what the outcome will be?",1381854269

It was the js engine. &quot;use asm&quot; carries symantical knowledge so a browser can warn if you break out of the subset. It also serves as a strong hint that should make the optimizer&#x27;s easier.<p>This is why I think asm.js is the future. Mozila does not need buy in from Google, or Apple, or MS.

Why are Ruby developers in desperately short supply?<p>I live in Israel, where Ruby has taken a while to make inroads.  But we just had a conference last week, and the many attendees were super excited about the language.  And companies were desperate to find employees who know Ruby and/or Rails.<p>Indeed, the biggest reason that I&#x27;ve found companies give for avoiding the use of Ruby is the scarcity of experienced developers.  A client of mine switched from Ruby to PHP last year, simply because he could easily find PHP programmers, and they cost a lot less.  You could argue that this points to companies leaving Ruby, but in many ways, I&#x27;d say that it rather indicates Ruby is a victim of its own success.<p>Even if Ruby is dying (which I don&#x27;t think is the case), plenty of seemingly dead languages are still in demand, and are used on all sorts of projects.  You can command great consulting rates in COBOL, today, if you want.<p>Both Ruby and Rails have strong, active communities that are pushing the language and framework forward in all sorts of interesting ways.

If everything simply came down to a vote there would be no incentive for the captain to save for 10 years and build a boat.<p>If the 4 fishermen had all saved their money together, and pooled their resources to build the boat equally, <i>then</i> they could have equal say in how the fishing operation is run.",1381853345

6554105,comment,6549502,6553009,4,0,lambda,,,"It&#x27;s actually pretty difficult, technically, to provide you with a minimum guaranteed amount of bandwidth, without simultaneously limiting everyone else.<p>The problem is that there are many layers in the networking stack which interact in complicated ways. TCP congestion control algorithms and TCP slow start, which happen at the endpoints. Buffering, which happens at pretty much every intermediate hop in the path. And traffic shaping, which can pretty much only drop packets to limit bandwidth used.<p>If I&#x27;m supposed to guarantee you 768kbps, that means that I need to drop any packets from everyone else that exceeds the capacity minus 768kbps. But if I do this for everybody, I&#x27;m back to the case where I&#x27;m giving everyone a dedicated 768kbps, and they aren&#x27;t able to share excess bandwidth at all.<p>Now, you could imagine a scheme in which I don&#x27;t limit other people&#x27;s bandwidth until you actually start using some. But then if it&#x27;s congested when you start your transfer, you won&#x27;t actually be able to send data at your full 768kbps at first, so TCP congestion control will kick in and limit you to less than that. So when traffic shaping looks at your stream, it sees something less than being used. Should it then limit everyone else such that it guarantees you your full 768kbps? If it does that every time someone uses their connection, then services that trickle just a small amount of data will essentially guarantee that everyone is always being guaranteed their 768kbps by limiting everyone else, and you&#x27;re back to the &quot;OK, now everyone has a dedicated 768kbps connection that won&#x27;t go faster&quot;.<p>Or should it limit everyone else based on the bandwidth that you are currently using? Say, when it notices that you are sending 10 kbps, it throttles everyone else down to allow you 15 kbps; then when you increase to sending 15 kbps, it throttles everyone else down to allow you to send 20 kbps, and so on, until you hit your guaranteed bandwidth. Based on the delays it takes for TCP congestion control to ramp up the speed it tries to send while traffic shaping ramps up the amount it&#x27;s limiting everyone else to give you the bandwidth you need, and the latencies involved (generally tens to low hundreds of milliseconds round trips) it could be a few seconds before you are actually able to get up to your guaranteed bandwidth.<p>But those first few seconds are generally the most crucial to be delivered quickly. Most people are browsing the web, where there are lots of short page loads. You want those to be able to kick in quickly and then be done with.<p>Remember, this is an industry where we&#x27;ve only recently come to understand the effects of buffer bloat on performance. Effective quality of service guarantees, other than giving everyone X guaranteed bandwidth by limiting everyone else to the total minus X bandwidth (which, when the network approaches capacity, becomes not much different than giving everyone an X bandwidth dedicated line), is a hard problem.<p><pre><code>  My real point is that I do not see why people should be \n  punished for using their connection continuously. Comcast \n  did not offer me &quot;burst service,&quot; they offered me &quot;always \n  on&quot; service with &quot;speeds up to X.&quot; I feel little sympathy \n  for an ISP that massively oversold service and then claimed \n  that it is abusive for customers to actually use what they \n  are paying for.\n</code></pre>\nYes. It&#x27;s always on service (as in, you can be connected and have the service available 100% of the time) and have speeds up to X available. That&#x27;s what they promised, and that&#x27;s what they deliver. They also sold this as a &quot;Residential&quot; service. They have other services for commercial and dedicated lines, that they will sell you for greater utilization.<p>You are not paying for continuous use of X, you are paying for an always available line that gives you speed up to X, for personal residential use.<p>Restrictions on not using the network abusively or not running commercial services on a home network are not some creepy abusive plot, they are really the best that the networks can do to provide you with affordable, high-speed broadband.<p>Do I wish that there were more competition? Sure. Do I wish that I got higher speeds for cheaper? Sure. Do I wish that they would be network neutral and not block ports running on my network? Absolutely. But there&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with selling a residential plan that is for residential purposes, and enforcing that, separately from their commercial plan, and separately from their dedicated plan. It&#x27;s not that difficult; if you want to use it for commercial purposes, use their commercial plan. If you want guaranteed bandwidth, buy a dedicated line.<p>And remember, the ISPs have not &quot;massively oversold&quot; their services. If you look at the FCC&#x27;s report (measured in 2011): <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20130511164730/http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/measuringbroadbandreport/Measuring_U.S._-_Main_Report_Full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20130511164730/http://transition....</a> , you&#x27;ll see several ISPs that actually exceed their advertised bandwidths even during peak hours. Now, some of them are clearly not doing so well by that metric; Century Link is not even hitting 80% off peak, and barely 50% on peak. I would say you have a good case for false advertising there. But if you notice, Comcast and Verizon FiOS manage to exceed their advertised bandwidth, on average, even on peak. This matches pretty well with my experience over the last 5 years or so. I&#x27;ve had both DSL and Cable. DSL routinely underperformed what was sold, which was already paltry. But cable has generally exceeded what was sold, when connecting to servers that could actually handle the load.<p>So, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call that &quot;massively overselling&quot;, other than maybe Century Link (and the other DSL providers don&#x27;t hold up too well either).<p>Think of it like a buffet. For efficiency and simplicity, it&#x27;s an all-you-can eat plan; unlike food, people aren&#x27;t very good at knowing how much they are going to use and so charging based on usage is much more unpopular, making buffet style plans much more populat. So they do &quot;all you can eat&quot;. And the rules are, it&#x27;s all <i>you</i> can eat, and in one sitting; you can&#x27;t take a bunch with you and then sell it to someone else, nor can you horde food for takeout because &quot;you&#x27;re going to eat it later&quot;. Would you start complaining and railing that the all-you-can eat buffet massively overselling? No. That&#x27;s all that they&#x27;re doing with the internet plan; it&#x27;s just that there are less social conventions and it&#x27;s easier to accidentally (or deliberately) massively overuse your fair share of bandwidth than it is to massively abuse a buffet, since it all happens automatically.",1381853087

And, if you&#x27;re paranoid about your &quot;long term keys&quot;, generate them on a different machine than the one on which you serve up disk-wiping entropy.

But I&#x27;m a little concerned that such a suggestion dignifies an unrealistic risk.<p>* Meanwhile, the notion that &quot;lesser&quot; secrets, like IV and padding, can deal with less randomness doesn&#x27;t seem to bear empirical scrutiny. The attacks that have tended to matter against cryptosystems in the last few years have, with the exception of the P&#x27;s and Q&#x27;s zero-cold-start-entropy issue, not targeted long-term secrets, but rather have hinged on details like padding (random padding in the OAEP/PKCS#1 case, I guess; most crypto padding is deterministic).<p>* The mentality of &quot;long term secrets&quot; and &quot;short term crypto parameters&quot; that you laid out already missed a doozy: DSA and ECDSA nonces, which people who think like your comment did thought of as &quot;undemanding&quot;, but for which it turns out that just being able to predict <i>a couple of bits</i> of that parameter can get you with a few thousand samples all the way back to private keys.<p>I think you&#x27;d be better off, cryptographically and from a software design perspective, with a single CSPRNG that was suitable for all cryptographic use cases, and, if users are paranoid, have them tap a physically different CSPRNG for their &quot;long term keys&quot; --- which they need to do anyways on the presumption that the systems that they use routinely are also probably owned up.<p>Also, I have to again point out that the Linux CSPRNG design doesn&#x27;t handle <i>any</i> of these cases well. Its /dev/random is unusable by demanding applications in steady state, with the possible (terrible) workaround of reimplementing CSPRNGs seeded from small amounts of /dev/random data in userspace (and all the attendant flaws); its /dev/urandom is unsafe at cold start. <i>Something&#x27;s</i> gotta give in that design: it&#x27;s doing extra work internally and inflicting extra work on developers, all for a worse result than FreeBSD.<p> <i>Re: realism: it&#x27;s always easy to argue &quot;attacks always get better, we should account for every attack, realistic or not&quot;. But engineering is about tradeoffs, and here the tradeoff Linux is making is to service an attack unknown to the literature that is likely precluded by the basic design of a modern refreshing CSPRNG, and doing so at the expense of protecting against very realistic attacks that have been discovered in the wild; it doesn&#x27;t help that Linux (in general) seems to respond to that point by suggesting that userland devs should have done a better job.</i><p><i>Oh, dubiously-informed CSPRNG opinions; I sure do have them.</i>",1381852996

If none of these servers have your name cached when you run the tool, they will all return fresh information, and the tool will report that your DNS update has &quot;propagated&quot; when in reality there are many caching name servers out there at other ISPs which still have stale information cached.<p>Fortunately, there&#x27;s a better way to know when your change has &quot;propagated&quot; - look up the record&#x27;s TTL, which is the maximum number of seconds it can remain cached.  Until that amount of time elapses from your update, there are potentially name servers out there serving up stale information.<p>Now, a tool to check for #2 would actually be quite useful.  Transfers from master to slave are supposed to happen immediately, and you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about this if your domain uses a good DNS service, but I&#x27;ve seen many misconfigured or over-complicated DNS setups where this doesn&#x27;t happen reliably.  A tool that queried all the authoritative servers for a domain to see which ones haven&#x27;t updated would be quite useful for debugging these sorts of misconfigurations.<p>[1] Specifically, those which are misconfigured to allow queries from anyone.  Wide open name servers like these can be used as part of DOS attacks.  In a perfect world, the only caching name servers you&#x27;d be able to query would be the ones operated by your ISP, and public ones which have anti-DOS features, like Google Public DNS.",1381852993
6554090,comment,6553367,6553833,2,0,bhauer,,,"Your heuristics are a very close match for my own.  I&#x27;ve written similar options in previous threads here concerning flagging and the ranking algorithm.<p>Whenever this matter surfaces, I recommend the HN Slapdown user script [1] which indicates stories that have been moved below the position they would have based on points only.  In other words, it draws attention to stories that have been flagged or otherwise adversely affected.<p>In my opinion, the homepage either weights non-upvote inputs too heavily or receives too many non-upvote interactions from users.<p>I can&#x27;t be certain whether flagging or other measures such as the &quot;flamewar detector&quot; are more or less responsible for the volatility of the home page ranking.  My only anecdotal evidence is that when I have (very rarely) flagged stories, I&#x27;ve witnessed an immediate and severe rank adjustment, often immediately sending the submission into second-page purgatory.  This has given me great respect for the severity of flagging.<p>My heuristics:<p>1. Most of all, I try to keep my interactions positive.  If I don&#x27;t <i>agree</i>, I act as if I don&#x27;t <i>care</i>, by which I mean I do nothing.  I see little value in downvoting something I disagree with.  It won&#x27;t change the person&#x27;s mindonly a comment in reply has a chance of that.<p>2. I will downvote comments that I believe are objectively wrong and potentially misleading to other readers or are clearly intended to be offensive or mean-spirited.  Still, I feel I am very sparse with downvotes.  I downvote approximately one out of every 1,000 comments I read.<p>3. I&#x27;ve only flagged stories that are unrelated to technology, but even then only in extreme cases.  I don&#x27;t bother flagging stories about popular fiction, movie reviews, or other elements of geek culture because I don&#x27;t think those stories are an epidemic at HN.  Like you, I feel it&#x27;s important to leave a comment when flagging a submission.  I have flagged two stories if my memory serves me correctly.<p>4. I skim the new section on every visit to site; about once per day.<p>5. I upvote stories I find interesting or agreeable.  I think this is the point of the upvote.  Upvotes are where I can be entirely subjective.  I upvote approximately one out of every 10 stories I read.<p>6. I upvote comments by the same rule as stories.  I upvote approximately one out of every 100 comments I read.<p>7. I strongly disagree with downvoting or flagging simply because of disagreements.  I don&#x27;t think use of downvoting is as problematic at HN as elsewhere (e.g., Reddit), but I do feel there is still slightly excessive comment downvoting and moderately excessive story flagging (or other adjustments).<p>[1] <a href=""http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150452"" rel=""nofollow"">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150452</a>",1381852989

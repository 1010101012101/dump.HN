",,"HNers:<p>There's been an abundance of discussion, misinformation, and general mayhem for many site owners in the preceding weeks over Google's latest algorithm update. Questia.com, one of my company's sites, was negatively affected by the change, in some surprising ways. .<p>Explicitly targeted at ""low quality"" sites, many companies feel that they were wrongly classified as low quality by this algo update, but I'm not here to make a stump speech for Questia. Accounting for my own bias, we feel like there's considerable value for users of Questia: with over 75,000 books, millions of peer-reviewed journal articles, and tools (annotation, citation generation) for students and researchers, offered at a reasonable cost.<p>The question, in my mind, is how closely can an algorithm model a human's experience of quality, using Questia.com as a case study? What is it about the site that might cause a person (or algorithm) to classify it as low quality?",1299513595

It is particularly annoying on slower devices, such as Edge or 3G smartphones, where you see the lag even more strikingly.<p>From a user-experience, content-oriented framework, this entire architecture should be reversed.  The URI should point to the content, not the presentation as it does with Hashbang.  The content should be served first, in a readable format, and then the javascript magic should kick in, download all the chrome in the background and then update the page once with all the other elements.<p>If you're going to have your page do a secondary load anyway (as hashbang does now) you might as well make the content the front-and-center part.",1299513039

2297444,comment,2297155,2297261,0,0,siculars,,,"I've given a few talks about NOSQL in general and Riak in particular and blogged[0] about both. I agree with all of your comments and will try to add a bit. One of the major driving design considerations of Riak is that of predictable scalability. Meaning that for each unit of hardware that you add to the system you are returned a predictable level of performance. You see this throughout the design of the system. Homogeneity amongst the nodes - meaning that all nodes are the same and there are no special nodes - is a big win. So is tunable CAP, as you already mentioned. Another major win from my perspective is the modular nature of the code base. I think it is one of the best layouts of a large system that I have seen yet. If you look at the main Riak repo you will see that it is comprised of a few sub modules. Basically most of the system is compartmentalized in this fashion. Major advantage is that development of components can proceed at their own pace and components can be reused/mixed more easily.<p>Re. Key limitations when using the default bitcask backend:<p>There is a spreadsheet[1] that outlines the number of keys you can have in your system based on a few variables. Definitely worth checking out. Two things to note here. There is the hard limit of keys per machine - due to each machines max memory - and there is the larger limit of keys per cluster based on the max memory of the cluster. Note that all this applies specifically when using the bitcask backend. There has been lots of talk about how to change this going forward and I know the Basho team is looking into it. Riak is quite interesting in that it can support a number of different backends - at the same time even. So you could have a bitcask backend for some data and a memory backend for other data. Since Riak is distributed, the implication is that outside of thinking about a single machines resources you should also think of the total clusters resources. Particularly, cluster total memory, total cpu cores and total disk spindles, that last one quite important but under-considered.<p>Re. max nodes in production:<p>One of the major considerations when dealing with a Dynamo derived system like Riak is cross node chatter. Riak does a lot of its magic by way of a gossip channel that is sending around all kinds of data. As the number of nodes in the system increases the level of chatter increases. I think there needs to be more work in optimizing that chatter for larger cluster sizes and I that has been happening if you follow the change logs.<p>If you follow the mailing list or irc you will notice that the primary concern amongst people new to Riak is that of querying. Riak has no secondary indexes, outside of Riak search, which is a separate download that is built on top of Riak (see code modularization). Riak has no native ordering. All of those things need to happen in the m/r phase. As it stands I think this is one of the major friction points to further adoption and why I have consistently recommended pairing Riak with Redis whenever possible.<p>These limitations aside, Riak represents, IMHO, the best mix of distribution, ease of use, raw power and growth potential of the currently in production NOSQL persisted datastore offerings. Philosophically I am very much attuned to the Dynamo world view and as a strict adherent think that Riak is the best representative from that perspective. Take that for what you will.<p>Disclaimer - Riak and Redis are my nosql databases of choice.<p>[0]<a href=""http://siculars.posterous.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siculars.posterous.com</a><p>[1]<a href=""https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ak4OBkABJPsxdEowYXc2akxnYU9xNkJmbmZscnhaTFE&hl=en&authkey=CMHw8tYO#gid=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ak4OBkABJPsxdEowYXc...</a>",1299512861

A while back, a woman named Gina Storey from EdgeLink called me about a job that involved an AJAX library I have fairly strong experience with (Ext-JS). It was a short-term contract without health insurance, and as I have a child on the way, I wasn't particularly interested in giving up the insurance from my current job. I told her that I'd be much more interested in it as a side-gig in addition to my day job, but she said that none of her clients have ever been interested in such an arrangement and asked how much money it would take for me to give up my insurance. I gave her an ""f off"" figure and we left it at that.<p>Soon after, I got an invitation to complete a survey regarding my experience and what they could do better. I haven't had that much fun filling out a survey in years. I told them that, in the 3 months since that conversation, I had started checking craigslist ads once a week for additional side work and had found 4 clients who paid me for exactly the sort of after-hours work that Gina said ""nobody was intersted in."" With an average of 30 minutes searching a week, I found a paying client every 3 weeks and they were getting 0% of the money I was making just because she was unwilling to pursue the work arrangement I was interested in. I cc'ed her manager (he had contacted me previously) on the e-mail and made it clear I couldn't recommend them to anyone I knew largely because of her unwillingness to compromise on what she thought her customers wanted.<p>In general, I don't mind recruiters in the same way that I don't mind garbagemen, stevedores and pharmaceutical reps - they're easily ignored and have little impact on my professional life.

2297403,comment,2295813,2296315,0,0,jerf,,,"""What other alternatives are there? (Twisted, EventMachine, ...?)""<p>For every major high-level language, there is at least one Node-like library, and sometimes more than one (Perl has POE, Event::Lib, based on my experience the raw glib wrapper isn't half bad albeit perhaps not the fastest, but you get good access to anything else based on glib, in fact Perl has so many that there's an Any::Event wrapper to remove your dependence on the underlying event library!). My point isn't that Node.js is bad. I actually don't think it is.<p>My point is that the <i>hype</i> is bad. It's wrong to think it's bringing anything unique to the table, because it simply isn't doing anything that has not be done literally <i>dozens</i> of times, except it's doing it in Javascript. If you want it done in Javascript instead of Python, more power to you. I'm particularly incensed by the idea that Node.js' approach to asynchronous is the only way to do it and the number of people it has produced who it has anti-educated into thinking Haskell and Erlang and all kinds of other languages can't possibly be asynchronous because you can't see the manually-chopped-up event handlers in the code. I'm not guessing. I've met these people online. You may know better, but a lot of people don't; whether or not it was intended the hype is actually lying to people about the state of the programming world, comparing itself to the world of 1995.<p>I am also trying to speed up the education cycle that all of those other dozens of attempts have been through in which manually-compiled event-based programming <i>inevitably</i> explodes into unmaintainable complexity, and none of the dynamic languages, including Javascript, have the necessary constructs to truly contain it. Some of the dynamic languages are even more powerful than today's Javascript, such as Python with its generators (though ECMAScript is supposed to be getting those, I don't know if any browser has them yet) and it's still not enough. The structure of event-based programming demands such an explosion. Been here, done this.<p>You can see it already starting to poke out from under the hype, if you're watching carefully. This is going to get worse, not better (because there isn't a solution, just a variety of hacks long since tried and found to only slightly improve things at significant complexity cost themselves), and I'm actually trying to do the community a <i>favor</i> by deflating the balloon so it doesn't pop so hard.<p>(If you know Haskell, and you look at the implicit type signatures being put on things like callbacks, it becomes easy to see the problem. The clearest place to see the problem is a function that takes a callback for something, until one day you need to pass in a callback that itself has to go do something that requires a callback and suddenly you've got a big problem. The usual callback in Node.js is actually just a relatively-pure function, they are <i>not</i> in IO, which is done behind the scene for you. Then when you need to do something else, you've got some real problems. Solvable, yes, but at a fairly significant complexity cost, partially because any given issue can be addressed but you can't really address all of them simultaneously (simplicity, exception correctness, dealing with control flow across callbacks, etc.). Every time you write a callback or choose where to break the function up into a callback you're actually laying down <i>far</i> more restrictions on the code than you can easily see, but I don't go to this explanation very often because by the time you can understand it it is also borderline obvious.)<p>What other alternatives are there? One, use Node.js with awareness of the issues. There are places where it is fine. I just would incredibly strongly anti-recommend it if you know you're going to be continuously developing whatever you're building in it, especially your core product, rather than writing ""a proxy socket server for web sockets to conventional sockets"" and being done at some point. The other alternative is to actually work in a language/runtime where you don't have to manually perform all this tedious work. There's a number of them coming out and one of them is probably going to go mainstream at some point; of the current lot Go would be my best guess. Google isn't pushing it, but it's still got Google's name on it, and I don't know of anything else right now with the equivalent name power. History suggests name power is necessary for a language to crack the mainstream in anything less than 15 years. It probably requires the least adaptation to a new style of the bunch, the other advantage it has from the mainstream point of view.",1299512013

They are salespeople, and salespeople compete only with each other. That 6 percent commission is the unwavering aspect of their model -- they built it to ensure that it always gets dropped into their shark tank. Consumers do not benefit from this system, ever, and every single entity in the real estate industry wants to keep it that way.""<p>As much as the industry would like to thwart progress, they can't. There is too much money in this industry for their not to be ""rebels"" looking to take market-share by keeping prices low.<p>Companies like Redfin are offering flat-fee listings, with typical realtor services, including MLS listing.<p>There are quite a few ""flat fee MLS"" services as well that offer bare-bones services to buyers, mostly getting their house into MLS. While access is still restricted, a couple hundred dollars isn't a huge barrier.<p>I am currently selling my house and am using a flat-fee MLS service. I pay, I believe, $400 to have my house in MLS. I can then determine what commission a seller agent gets.<p>In a ""traditional"" MLS transaction, the seller agent gets 3% and the buyer agent (if there is one) gets 3%. Most realtors will negotiate that down, and I've personally offered 2.5% to seller agents on my house.<p>As to how worth-it the agent system is, a lot depends on your market. If you're in a large market, I'd expect the value of agents to go down because alternative systems are likely to be in place. I live in a small market and have used MLS, a sign in my front yard, Craigslist, and a few newspaper ads to market my house. I can say that 90% of inquiries have come from buyer agents through MLS. I'm going to have to give up a few thousand due to the 2.5%.",1299511382

Then you include the file in your processing code, use PHP's output buffering to capture the content, split it into chunks, and run markdown and smartypants on it. Then you have HTML blocks in $content[0], $content[1], etc, which can be included into the template PHP file.<p>An approach like this would work really well with a Dropbox backend.",1299511082

But the other 1% may surprise the whumpus out of you.<p>Also, I would consider things like this to be highly unstable unless I read a white paper from the implementation team saying that this is by design. If you hurriedly remove all of your dot references and replace them with functions, you may find a point release of the implementation changes everything again.<p>You have control over your implementation on the server, but users can upgrade their browsers at will without consulting you first :-)<p>p.s. Did I miss it, or did they only test browsers without looking at server implementation like V8 or Rhino?",1299510387

In many states, it's a strict-liability offense to sell alcohol to a minor, without the prosecutor having to prove intent. Usually the clerk is exempted from liability if the minor showed a fake ID (that wasn't so bad as to be obviously fake), or if the minor looked clearly over 26 or 30, or whatever the state's threshhold must-ask-for-ID age is. If it's a 20-year-old who didn't clearly look 30+, though, and you didn't ask for ID, it's a criminal offense (in some states).",1299510298

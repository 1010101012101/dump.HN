It&#x27;s like the difference between a truly random random number generator, and one that just spits out a pre-determined list; &quot;I&quot; don&#x27;t get to pick the numbers either way.<p>When I was younger, I tried to &quot;see where my thoughts come from&quot;, and it always seems like they come around some corner, out of some blind spot. I never meditated but I, but I always liked the phrase &quot;watching thoughts arise&quot;, because that&#x27;s how it seems, they come into view of my inner eye so to speak, but the inner eye does not make them, not originally. I can add 2+2, but I can&#x27;t <i>make</i> me get the idea to add 2+2. Well, actually, I can make myself get the idea to add 2+2, but I can&#x27;t make myself get the idea to make myself get the idea to add 2+2... and so on. Is it possible to talk about these things without it sounding like esoteric gibberish?<p>Anyway, I kinda don&#x27;t think we have free will, not to the degree we like to believe, anyway - but I can&#x27;t help treating myself and others as if we did.

The point of tailoring languages to a string still -- weakly -- stands, though: but he could also do that for a finite number of strings. Weakly also because he completely misses the point of Kolmogorov complexity. It&#x27;s not meant to be practical in any way. It&#x27;s a mathematical tool to uncover some facts about the complexity of things (mostly mathematical objects) and a more solid framework for data compression and randomness, which he glanced at the beginning of the article. In a sense it&#x27;s like other non-computable constructions, it provides truths without specific instances, because their existence would be too powerful.<p>Some of the interesting theorems are found in a chapter of the following book:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Information-Theory-Thomas-Cover-ebook/dp/B00HLG9ISQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1398217278&sr=1-3&keywords=information+theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Information-Theory-Thomas-Cov...</a><p>It gives a good grasp that Kolmogorov complexity answers meaningful questions not well defined in regular information theory: questions of optimality in finite lengths.",1398217460

My guess is the chinese guy could watch how the cards were sweeped, adjust in his head which cards were in what half, and recompute odds based on the backs.

7631496,comment,7630632,7630632,10,0,bo1024,,,"The post has an incorrect definition of Kolmogorov Complexity.<p>It says:<p>> The overall Kolmogorov complexity of a string is thus defined as\nK(x)=|p|\nwhere p is the shortest program string for language L such that\nL(p)=x\nand we consider all programming languages.<p>This is wrong. The definition of Kolmogorov complexity is always given relative to some fixed programming language. For example, K_perl or K_ruby are just fine, although we usually consider some Universal Turing Machine. The reason that we can prove theorems about Kolmogorov Complexity without even specifying which language we fixed is because of invariance (on all but a finite number of strings, any two languages will differ by at most some fixed constant). But the point is that you have to take a single fixed programming language. Then the issue raised in the blog post does not arise.<p>As this post is almost a year old, I doubt it matters much or is worth contacting the author though. But for future reference, if you think you&#x27;ve found such a basic mistake in a foundational concept in math or CS, you can always ask about it on cs.stackexchange.com or math.stackexchange.com rather than making a potentially embarassing post about how mathematicians are wrong/silly.",1398215708

On the other hand, I&#x27;ve seen cases where mentally disturbed people invent (or self-delude) incredibly detailed narratives of persecution. We could be dealing with a situation where one, the other, both, or neither is happening.</i><p>The thing that irks me about all this is that murky incidents like this, where the alleged victim is (to many) not a very sympathetic character, and possibly acted improperly herself and instigated the whole situation (if the anon blog post is to be believed), does little to help set an example for why the <i>real</i> instances of harassment are so wrong and terrible.<p>After this, I&#x27;m left with a very poor taste in my mouth.  GH&#x27;s investigation was likely somewhat flawed, though it&#x27;s unclear to what degree.  Horvath almost certainly wasn&#x27;t telling the full story about what happened, and may even have instigated the entire thing, and is using the prevalence of sexism in tech (and the expected knee-jerk community outcry) to attack someone she&#x27;s (unjustifiably?) angry with.  Or maybe everything she&#x27;s said is true, and the Preston-Werners are terrible people, and GH has/had a serious discrimination problem coming from the top.

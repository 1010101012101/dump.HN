10609520,comment,10606758,10606758,0,0,binaryapparatus,,,"As a iOS/Mac developer for the last five years, I have seen steady decline in sales, developer quality and customer quality. Turn towards low level consumer markets that took place few years ago can&#x27;t be mitigated with any amount of trickery to boost sales. Trials are needed but they won&#x27;t fix the problem. Problem is that we all inflated the market way beyond its capacity and such bubble can&#x27;t stay inflated for long.<p>I have some six Mac apps in MAS and I consider that number too high -- some of them will have to go. On the other hand any other Asian based developer has 70+ apps, all at $0.99 and not worth the cost of the web page they are on. Apple loves to brag about number of apps in any of the stores but in order to do so they let any crappy app in as long as it does not break terribly. That drives normal customers away, then sales drive normal developers away.<p>I don&#x27;t see any solution, it is downwards spiral, unless Apple enforces &#x27;quality police&#x27; to leave low quality apps away from App Store. And that won&#x27;t happen.",1448182757

10609499,comment,10606226,10609159,0,0,mercurial,,,"> On a current technology fad: React seems to be designed to ignore 40 years of accumulated software best practices. [1] Separation of concerns? Who needs that any more? And the rationale for it is that it allows teams of 100 developers work together on an app. Open standards? Nah, how about lock-in to custom language extensions that will prevent you from migrating your code to the next web standard! Much better.<p>That&#x27;s some strawman right here. First, JSX is optional. Sencondly, JSX is open. You may disagree whether it&#x27;s a standard or not, but you know what? If tomorrow you end up with a large codebase where you want to get rid of JSX, you just apply a JSX transpiler on your existing codebase. Problem solved. As for separation of concerns, you have a little bit more of a case. React does allow you to put business logic in your views... just like 99% percent of templating languages out there. But React does not <i>force</i> you to do that. You can have only the minimum amount of logic you need, and put most of your frontend business logic in your store.",1448182123

Meanwhile, Indoor use accounted for more than 170 gallons per household per day. Not surprisingly, the most in-home water consumption was in toilet flushes. A more shocking finding, however, was the whopping 18 percent lost to leaks inside homes, the study found.&quot; The family is well-aligned with that water use.<p>Of course, the &quot;per household&quot; in that study is an average. This household has 4 people, while the study uses an average of 2.94 people per household, so we should expect this family to use more water than average.<p>The study is at <a href=""http://water.cityofdavis.org/Media/PublicWorks/Documents/PDF/PW/Water/Documents/California-Single-Family-Home-Water-Use-Efficiency-Study-20110420.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://water.cityofdavis.org/Media/PublicWorks/Documents/PDF...</a> . Page 197 gives an estimated water use per household as a function of household size, using various models (old homes, new homes, California homes, and high efficiency homes).<p>By that benchmark, 178/gallons is well below the 200 gal/day average for California homes, though worse than expected for a high efficiency home, which comes out to 150 gallons per day.<p>I don&#x27;t really see the source of your astonishment. By all accounts, the water use in this household is below average for California. If it were an older house, with more wasteful fixtures, then these numbers would be unsurprising even for a family doing its best to conserve.<p>> Even such generous estimates get barely to ⅓ of her reported consumption.<p>I lived in Santa Fe, which has some of the lowest water use per capita of any city in the south-west. I had drip irrigation for my garden, and like most in the city, no grass. The city had rebate and other incentive programs in place to promote water conservation. For example, I got my toilets replaced with high efficiency toilets for free, due to a city program which coupled housing growth to water conservation. They now have a rebate for households which install water-free urinals. Even with all that in place, and quoting from <a href=""http://savewatersantafe.com/2015/06/santa-fe-2014-gpcd-sets-standard-for-the-west/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://savewatersantafe.com/2015/06/santa-fe-2014-gpcd-sets-...</a> &quot;For people in single-family residences, each person within the household uses 51 gallons per person per day.&quot;<p>You can see that that 50 gallons/month is higher than your &quot;generous&quot; expectations of 1/3 of 178 gallons = 45 gallons/capita/day. While it&#x27;s certainly possible to have a lower water use lifestyle, all evidence is that it&#x27;s not a quick or cheap change.<p>Is your astonishment not all the more greater for those using over 25x the district average, as reported in this piece?",1448181207

A passive, unassuming employee willfully blinded by the facade of calling oneself an entrepreneur.<p>After reading your post ""Startup Ideas We'd Like to Fund"" along with 200-some comments, everything just seems watered down. It seems all too ""Model T"". Its as if people are willing to build these products just to build products. Wheres the passion?<p>Myself and fellow CS buddies have been seriously evaluating the option of applying to ycombinator with something we've have been working on. But something just doesn't feel right.<p>I would also argue that with ~$25,000, its not the ideas your funding Paul, its really the people.<p>Does anyone else feel the way i do, or is it just me ...<p>TC.",1216648758

252222,comment,250704,251810,0,0,LarryV,,,"Jerry,<p>I totally agree that things could always be better and that incentives are the key to this.  There is a business concept from the 80s called 'open book management' where everyone in the company sees where all the money goes.  This is more transparency than even public companies have.<p>I think it could be a technique that would get everyone from accounting to IT more involved in the business.  I also think there needs to be much shorter expectations of how long someone will work for a company.  Hollywood is on to something with the way they bring together small teams to make a film that then disband and reform in a new configuration for the next film.  I wonder what would happen if every person in the company had to choose each year whether they want to continue with the company.  They would in effect have a one year job.  This might make their sense of urgency and priority for the 52 weeks within that year much more focused.   It might also form a company with much more dedicated people who really want to be there.",1216647441

252220,comment,250704,251323,0,0,cturner,,,"Hmm. At the moment there seems to be a pattern creeping in of some of the majors allowing people to do non-deliverable trades against metal prices on futures exchanges (and for that matter NDFs on currencies which aren't liquid, I think it's the same trick underneath). I think this is very cool and wonder whether it could be slowly expanded further. For example - people could instead take holdings into funds linked to diversified investments in specific investments or currency pairs in online games.<p>But always using the FX approach to trading: Buy/sell, base/terms, three-letter-code currencies, spot/fwd and swap.<p>If liquidity emerged for more markets from user requests on the site, you could add them later. To be honest, it's such an obvious idea that there's either something wrong with it, or someone is doing it already, or both.",1216647385

252217,comment,252185,252185,0,0,mojuba,,,"<i>But I have to wonder: is there a better way?</i><p>The answer is a language that can use a unified syntax for both generating markup and server-side functionality at the same time. There's probably only one candidate at the moment, and that's Lisp with a special set of macros that translate to HTML tags on output. The beauty of it is that S-expressions nicely map to markup and can execute stuff on the server. This macro library does exist and I think I saw it here at YCnews. It was a video and unfortunately I can't find it now.<p>There's one bit missing in this solution though: the client side. Can Lisp be translated to JavaScript? Something suggests that's perfectly possible.",1216646999

252207,comment,250704,250704,0,0,shipstone,,,"Here's one I'd like to see:<p>Why not have a simple geolocation service that matched where you're going with people in cars that will be going your direction soon?  Twitter that you want to go cross-town and in seconds you get a half dozen dynamically updated commuters that are going your way. Combine this with point-by-point gps instructions from point A to B, the commuter you select gets routing information that allows them to stop at an intersection and honk to let you know your ride is here. The service consists of three parts: (1) where you're going (and where you are via GPS) (2) a back end database that can figure out from all the real-time information who matches up (3) let you choose from the options - maybe based on the kind of car, their reputation/reliability, etc. Not too hard - in fact either Twitter or FriendFeed could be a big hunk of this business.<p>If geolocation and routing allowed people with cars to pick up people with minimum inconvenience, and if enough people with iPhone 3G-type phones could get streamed updated directions, and if there was a simple way to establish reputation, this could change how people commute and travel in cities, saving a tremendous amount of energy.<p>Posted on this at <a href=""http://www.cartwrightreed.com/2008/07/off-topic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cartwrightreed.com/2008/07/off-topic.html</a>",1216645711

252205,comment,251853,251884,0,0,midnightmonster,,,"For the last few months I've been part of a distributed team of 4-5 members. First time for me--all my client work has been remote, but It's usually just me and at most one other person.<p>I haven't had much trouble working with one other person, like the first poster modern communication tech does it fine for me. People complain that physically meeting only scales to as many people as can fit comfortably in a small conference room, but I'd say meeting electronically doesn't really scale past 2 or 3.<p>Even with just a 4-5 member team, all hands meetings are indeed phone calls that drag on (we're getting a bit better at keeping them brief).<p>And ""software design debates rapidly turn into a game of telephone""--oh yes. I may be wrong, but I fancy I have an excellent memory for the points and outcomes of such discussions, and it's endlessly frustrating to me to recap over and over when the same thing comes up next week, and the week after, etc.. Actually I don't know if that would be improved by being closer--besides this, the largest software team I've been on was 3 in person, years ago.<p>On the other hand, the other four or so members of the team all are on the west coast and have met--I'm the only one on the east coast. That's a problem for scheduling meetings sometimes, but I don't feel out of the loop or insecure. Part of that, no doubt, is that I'm not a founder--just a contractor. I care about the product as something I've put substantial work into, but it's not my baby and I'm not worried about someone stealing my baby away. There are four of us contractors building the product for the two not-very-technical founders. I guess that's another hot topic.",1216645502

Second, the correctness seems to often play second fiddle to whatever set pieces or plot is desired.  I understand this may be a pragmatic necessity, but it&#x27;s very obvious when the two start to generate friction against each other (scientific realism and plot) and I long for this to be balanced elegantly, with the science as a more integral component (truly &quot;leading the story&quot; as the article likes to suggest they are attempting) rather than the stucco you paint on after the fact, disguising up a weak skeleton against only the most peripheral examination.",1452640783

But in the end, you have a hobby business that is not really growing but only teetering so far, likely because as you said you aren&#x27;t putting in a lot of time and using it only as a side thing.<p>I really am not trying to be an ass, but I am trying to be honest based on my own experiences. Your business isn&#x27;t worth as much as you would like, although it is quite valuable in many ways.  Simply put, you don&#x27;t have a $135k profit on revenue of $140k because you are discounting the real cost to run and grow the business which someone else will have to hire out at least a portion of, pay taxes on, pay state fees etc.  So in reality, assuming the person is willing to assume at least 2-3 of the hats (business, finance and customer service) and hire out the technical then they may net $10-80k depending on if they hire contractors or a full time person.<p>At the same time like others already pointed out, it will boil down to how much is someone willing to pay.  But outside of a corporation that finds your project attractive because of market fit, or leads or something along those lines, sophisticated individuals with cash will not pay major multiples for a business that is essentially only mildly profitable after they factor in costs to maintain and grow it.  So your best bet is to sell to a corporation that has sunk costs already that is happy to take the extra revenue and leads and run.<p>Not saying you couldn&#x27;t get $150k to even at the high end $300k, but it will take a special set of circumstances.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d say you are looking at more like a $60k-150k type of sale being far more likely.<p>No matter what, good luck and I hope you can maximize your benefit.",1452640524

You can find people looking to work at startups, willing to put in the hours, and willing (somewhat) to defer compensation.

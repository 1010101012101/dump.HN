568063,comment,567756,567806,0,0,crux,,,"Normally I'd see somebody coming out and saying 'this is a replacement for X' to be both desperate and a little misguided; desperate because they're putting their (more successful) competitor's name right there in the title, and misguided because by setting yourself up as a X Replacement you quite often both establish yourself in the audience's mind in the exact same space and context as the established service, and also basically communicate: 'You already use X. But you shouldn't. You should stop right now.' Rather than say, 'Look at how cool Y is! You are probably so interested you're going to sign up right now and if you like it, maybe you'll forget about lame old X!'<p>In Posterous's case, though, they just keep churning out such powerful functionality that the reader ends up agreeing, 'Well hell, why _don't_ I use this?' A look at the official blog just shows you major, polished, easy-to-use feature after MPEtUF.<p>(But if they don't add Markdown support soon I'm gonna cry.)",1240030037

The Freud's lectures of psyhoanalysis can be useful as an bird-eye overview of the problem.<p>The main idea is about altering a personal history to get rid of a fixations, regressions, and other things which were accumulated from the past and especially childhood, developing new habits, changing yourself.<p>And there is a top-secret-great-magic-word: practice.<p>If one in in his/her thirties and still looking at this kind of books or texts that simply indicates the very serious problem which requires an intensive therapy.

Particularly with claims like:<p>""If the community is indeed walking away from monkeypatching.... that doesn't prove I'm wrong, it proves I am and was right about the dangers involved. I don't feel inclined to give the community much credit for coming around to the realization that unfettered monkeypatching is a bad idea two years later than I did.""<p>So ""the community"" (whoever they are) doesn't move as fast as you do.  What have you done to change it?  There are people who are out there trying to make things better.  Not simply painting everyone with the same brush and then writing them off.<p>Fine, you've got a problem with the way people use Monkey patching.  You should convince people of the dangers of using it.  You're not succeeding.<p>Monkey patching itself isn't the problem.  The problem is not writing portable code.<p>============================<p>Incidentally i find it extraordinarily frustrating that there are clearly a lot of people who down mod anyone who says anything positive about Ruby (since i can watch my points increase shortly after posting them, only to fall back to basically 1 or zero as time progresses, regardless of the content of my posts).",1240029809

568048,comment,566304,567988,0,0,calambrac,,,"I'm surprised, then, that you would so flippantly dismiss this with such an ignorant statement.  Java has had a generational gc for the majority of its existence, since version 1.2 (released '98, only 2 years after Oak dropped), which, of course, implies that its had an incremental or concurrent collector (or more appropriately, collectors - you can pick which one you want to use in Java-land, too) since at least then, as well.<p>If you had clicked past the pretty terrible article title and actually read up on this collector, you'd realize that isn't the ""generational"" or ""incremental"" that's important, it's the ""compacting"" part that, along with some implementation details, cuts down on management overhead and reduces fragmentation, and the effort to provide soft real-time behavior, along with some cool configuration parameters where you can specify how much of a given timeslice you're willing to give up for gc.<p>There are a lot of things that you can be critical of Java for, but slouching on the vm isn't really one of them.",1240028460

568037,comment,567394,567398,0,0,stcredzero,,,"It's analogous to the immune response.  Of course adults are going to be resistant to ideas that are a total mind-$%^#!  If something does not fit in with your foundation model of reality, then it's likely an exploit meme.  (Like, ""We are the messengers of the supreme being.  You must convince others of this, and also give us 10% of your earnings!"")<p>This poses a special problem for the transmission of things like values -- some of which are not exploit-memes but actually valuable heuristics for mutual benefit.  (Like honesty and fairness.)  Since the contexts that preoccupy the mainstream of each generation change so dramatically now, the lack of common context impedes the demonstration of values by an older generation to a younger one.  Several centuries ago, it would be commonplace to find 3 generations on the same dance floor, all having fun dancing to the same music.  Now, this is considered to be a ridiculous situation.<p>This change is so rapid now, that you see generational rifts in recent pop phenomena like Anime fandom.  A friend of mine who was an MC at some of the early Anime Expos got trashed online by some kid over some bit of web forum etiquette.  I'm sorry, but someone <i>that</i> connected with the history of your scene deserves a little patience and an explanation.  (I'm sure others have similar anecdotes from Hip-Hop or skateboarding.  Heck, there should be plenty of programming related anecdotes similar to this.)",1240027839

568032,comment,567807,567912,0,0,banned_man,,,"You're blaming evolution for womens' generally execrable tastes in men, but the source of the problem is likely cultural and psychological.<p>A large proportion of American women have been raised with an unspoken and often subliminal belief that sex is filthy, painful and degrading. This association is formed at a young age and most women are not aware that they have it, but it leads them to become attracted to men who are boorish, stupid, and threatening, rather than the intelligent and decent guys. Often, they are actually completely incapable of being sexually attracted to men who don't threaten and degrade them on, at the least, a subconscious level. This is what's at hand in the case of ""you're a nice guy, but I'm sorry, I'm just attracted to you. I really wish I was, but I'm not"".<p>This doesn't describe the majority of women or relationships, but it does describe nearly all of the sexually ""loud"" women. It seems paradoxical, but promiscuous women almost always have this subconscious distaste for sex, while relatively chaste women often have only a trace of it.",1240027342

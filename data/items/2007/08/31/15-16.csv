(For ""IT"" tech, not biotech.)<p>I like how Scott Kirsner, Globe reporter, compared it to the Red Sox vs. Yankees rivarly. The Sox have a huge budget compared to most teams, except the Yankees. And while the Sox have a complex about the Yankees, the Yankees barely know their is a rivalry. Can't go wrong with Red Sox analogies ;-)<p>",1188575115

With multiple string-case matches I would have to write string=? many many times:<p><pre><code> (cond ((or (string=? ""hello"" my-string)\n            (string=? ""world"" my-string))\n        (print ""match"")))\n</code></pre>\nTo do that with the string-case= macro:<p><pre><code> (string-case= my-string\n   ((""hello"" ""world"")\n    (print ""match"")))\n</code></pre>\nSaves quite a bit of typing and now I have a good example of why macros are good to have around :D<p><i>edit: formatting ftw.</i>",1188574406

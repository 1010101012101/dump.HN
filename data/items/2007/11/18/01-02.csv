81072,comment,81052,81052,0,0,viergroupie,,,"I can't speak for you, but I find that working crazy hours is a big waste of time in the long run. My health, happiness and mental soundness all deteriorate due to a screwed up sleep schedule and lack of socialization. Aside from the long-term consequences to body and mind, all this deterioration adversely affects the quality of my work. I spend a lot more time chasing dead ends when my life is out of whack. So take a break, have a drink with friends, maybe even get laid. Your project will thank you later. ",1195349886

I have the same problem :)<p>But I usually find that a few hours in the ""middle"" of the work night spent socially with friends or in a club do wonders to my concentration afterwards.<p>And even more important we need to get our heads out of the  fox holes once in a while otherwise we lose a lot of our creativity and very few things are more important in this field.",1195348717
81062,comment,81052,81052,0,0,abarrera,,,"IMHO it's all about the correct balance. If you want to succeed at anything in life you need to balance your leisure and your work. Too much work will consume you as a person, ruin any relationship and get you emotionally unbalanced. Not working and having way too much fun will ruin your economy, your health and your work. Try to have at least a little bit of fun. Sometimes you need to chill out if you want to focus on something. Don't try to focus it as two different things, they are both connected and part of the same cycle. \nPS: Don't drink too much tonight ;)",1195348004

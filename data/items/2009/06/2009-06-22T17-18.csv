The reason for that is as simple as it runs counter to what people usually preach: it is <i>less</i> concise. In the former, it is immediately clear that you are partitioning a list of days into partitions of weeks and summing over those weeks, resulting in a list of weekly sums. The extra word 'week', repeated twice, makes all the difference: all ingredients for comprehension are readily provided. The latter case, on the contrary, requires you to do a few mental operations to expand the expression into something meaningful, mentally adding the concept of a 'week' to understand what the code is doing. You need to do that everytime you read the code, which makes it <i>less</i> easy to understand.",1245692996

           #^int b 3]
       (cons a b))
</code></pre>
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are not hinted to be primitive types. Type hinting is purely for objects. Use hinting to make it clear to the compiler what sort of <i>objects</i> you are passing into something (e.g. a constructor that takes a String). If there is confusion, clojure will do reflection.<p>The right thing to do in this case, is the second thing that the author mentions:<p><pre><code>   (let [a (int 2)
         b (int 3)]
     (cons a b))
</code></pre>
a way to see that <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are really primitive is:<p><pre><code>    (let [x (int 5)]
      (.shortValue #^Integer x)) ; exception: ""can't type hint primitive...""

First it does a local fold on local inputs, then it does a global fold across all of the local fold results.<p>i.e. Assume we have three nodes and one key, ""our_key"", and values for ""our_key"" are distributed across the 3 nodes:<p>node1 : our_key : [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5]<p>node2 : our_key : [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10]<p>node3 : out_key : [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]<p>and our fold function ( which must be associative) is +. First we fold each node:<p>node1 : fold(+, [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5]) = our_key : [15]<p>node2 : fold(+, [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10]) = our_key : [40]<p>node3 : fold(+, [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]) = our_key : [65]<p>When each node is done with its local inputs, the key-value pairs are redistributed so that each key and its values are on a single node.

I offered to give the original talk for the opportunity to get feedback on new ideas and the opportunity to present JUnit Max (although it seems to me the chances of significant sales are small). I also told them of my need for revenue, to which they replied they had no budget. Then they asked to expand the talk to a much larger audience and record it. I said ""no"" to that, which triggered the post, because I haven't been in the habit of creating less than the most value I could imagine.",1245690384

India is just filling a demand.<p>After a decade or two of Indians growing up in this economy and seeing the failures first hand, I predict things will have equalized quite a bit, and the smart Indians will all be saying ""Why work for clueless bosses when we can do better and we have huge markets of our own?""

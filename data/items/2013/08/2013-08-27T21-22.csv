From <a href=""http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/landlord-watchlist/tenant-rights"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/landlord-watchlist/tenant-rights</a>:<p>> In general in New York City, a landlord may only enter a tenants apartment for three reasons: emergency repairs, non-emergency repairs or improvements, and apartment inspections. Emergency repair requires no advance notice to the tenant. However, access for non-emergency repairs and improvements requires a minimum of one weeks advance written notice, and access for inspection requires a minimum of 24 hours advance written notice.<p>If he was on vacation, then 24 hours written notice for inspection could consist of putting the notice on or under his door, waiting 24 hours, then going in for the inspection and removing the notice.<p>I&#x27;ve had my landlady enter my apartment without permission or notice before, and it was a little bit creepy, but I let it slide since she was such a nice lady. She wasn&#x27;t some owner of a big apartment complex or anything, just had a second house down the street that she rented out, I think mostly so she could store all of the extra furniture she picked up at flea markets and couldn&#x27;t fit into her own house. In fact, the reason she had entered our house was to stash a few lamps that she did&#x27;t want her sister to sell at a yard sale, so we came back one day and there were extra lamps sitting around.",1377640651

6286504,comment,6284800,6284800,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"My approach:  nurturing, with sharp corrective feedback when necessary.<p>Technological and information processes are difficult to measure even in the best cases.  As systems theorist Dennis Meadows notes, there are simple problems, in which solutions track monotonically better, and complex problems, in which the long-run preferred solution presents costs and negative growth in initial phases.  We&#x27;re willing to accept this for short-term projects with well-established trajectories:  a new business launch, building or infrastructure construction.  It&#x27;s much more difficult to accept and sell such approaches where the problem space is novel, where there&#x27;s little experience with it, where progress isn&#x27;t particularly visible, and/or the timelines are long (Meadows&#x27; principle work has been in the area of resource and population limits, which expresses all of these characteristics).<p>My experience and observations are that:<p>- People and organizations both prefer stability and predictability.  If I don&#x27;t know from day to day that I&#x27;ll have a job, that my door badge will work (among the reasons I find them psychically deadening, and I&#x27;ve heard similar views voiced unprompted by others -- &quot;well, I&#x27;ve still got a job&quot; as they entered the building), my productivity <i>will</i> suffer.  Much of the shift of pressure in the past 40 years or so has been of risk from organizations onto individuals.<p>- Consistency in feedback helps.  This is difficult with complex systems, and devising good metrics can be difficult.  I&#x27;ve often provided harsh feedback for systems I use (of late, Google+, though it&#x27;s annoying me less, today, GNOME in another H/N story).  Though I&#x27;m doing so as someone <i>outside the control structure of the organizations providing the service.</i>  It&#x27;s one thing to take criticism from someone who can choose to stay or walk away, it&#x27;s another when it comes from someone who can tell you to walk.  One of the interesting aspects of Free Software development is that it very often divorces the technical criticism and workflow from employment.  A kernel developer can hop from job to job, and still do the same work.  They can be harshly criticized by Linus or others on LKML, but those people have no ability to fire the developer, only to make a decision to accept or not accept submissions.<p>- Organizational sanity helps.  However (see my first point) organizations which themselves operate in high-risk environments are often poorly structured to be able to shield their employees from those pressures (and if you find yourself with management who succeeds in doing this, you&#x27;ve struck gold).

All wireless routers operating in US have to be on one of the 11 channels. When there are other wireless APs within the range, you and others share the channel. There&#x27;s a limitation on how much bandwidth a channel can give in total. That&#x27;s the hard limitation, given that CSMA/CA works well.

I do rather suspect something about that, but here is a direct story about copyright I was foolish enough to share with HN but received positive gratitude for(thanks.) It may help explain why my nose is so deep in this issue[1].<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6262162"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6262162</a><p>Some time ago I became engaged in the Syrian conflict, before it was a conflict.<p>There was a time when a multitude of cities rose up in peaceful demonstration. Civilian organizations took root to make clear cases for ways and means of reforms, both on the local and national scale. These local coordination committees were most publicly visible by foreigners on the net, being prolific in uploading of media, mainly during Friday protests after prayer. These local orgs, mainly teens, found sites like bambuser.com and youtube.com highly effective for disseminating and spreading word of solidarity for towns spread miles apart, those miles just may as well be worlds apart much like how it is in the US and other nations.<p>Well I helped disseminate these events, my favorite were those broadcast live on bambuser as it gave viewers a much more personal feeling for those demonstrating on the other end. Much respect to Hans Eriksson[1] who used his position at bambuser in a positive way, embracing these broadcasts and himself helping disseminate the broadcasts to the world.<p>These weekly mass demonstrations took a bloody turn, and while many stopped looking the coordination committees kept witness, services like bambuser kept showing live feeds even though they were turning increasing violent as Assad&#x27;s forces began publicly gunning down crowds.<p>Ever see the GPS trail of someone fleeing with a crowd of his neighbors during a live broadcast, while they were being shot at? I have. Here is a profile of a martyr who fought with his camera to show the world his life[2].<p>What does this have to do with copyright? Well those early days of mass demonstrations are valuable evidence of the true origins of the Syrian civil war, peaceful defiance met with violence.<p>During my monitoring and dissemination of other people&#x27;s hard fought media, I began processing some into panorama as the narrow field of view provided by handheld cams reduced much of the true impact of what the recorder meant to show to others. I made stitched images from video showing tanks awaiting a push into so-called &#x27;infected&#x27; cities[3]. I made images of the days during the fraudulent elections, of BMPs chasing unarmed civilians through the streets[4]. Later, I&#x27;ve stitched together images of war crimes that I can never remove from my thoughts. After doing this for many images I had video of which I also processed and began uploading those of potential interest, video of Assad&#x27;s troops hurling IEDs onto residential neighborhoods from helicopters for instance[5].<p>But the video that involves this discussion of copyright, is one held dear to many of the early activists. Held dear to many of those now deceased. It was a song sung by someone who himself, was killed in those early days of mass demonstrations.<p>Ibrahim Qashoush, a fireman and a poet from Hama Syria[6].<p>Ibrahim coined a song that became popular during these mass demonstrations in Hama, singing them in a multitude of breathtaking shows filled the entire town square (remember when towns had those?) with the families that lived there. Time passed, and after becoming depressed at the daily slaughter I decided to go back and make a stitched image[7] of that night in Hama, when Ibrahim sung before his throat was slit[8] for daring to sing.<p>After uploading the video to Youtube, marking the video as not copyrighted, then the image to imgur as usual I received a copyright complaint from CDBaby[9]. Apparently they thought that due to an artist of theirs including a sample of the protest audio, they retroactively owned the original protest song themselves.<p>I lodged a rebuttal saying that the video was clearly not theirs, and Youtube agreed. Attempts to contact CDBaby were futile. Having the copyright claim removed I was somewhat happy with the vindication that this dead man&#x27;s song was indeed not CDBaby&#x27;s, but infuriated that this company made ABSOLUTELY NO DUE DILIGENCE AS TO THEIR CLAIMS. Most of the time people, if they notice, can contact them saying a company like CDBaby was in the wrong. But in this case the man they wronged had his throat slit for the media CDBaby was now claiming as their own. Cue the rage.<p>Youtube removed the claim from my copy of the video[10] but when linking the original copy that I processed I noticed that CDBaby&#x27;s claim was still on their video. Looking further I found _ALL_ copies of this dead man&#x27;s voice claimed by CDBaby.<p>This is around the time I started making a stink on Twitter making sure to include CDBaby&#x27;s handle while pummeling them for stealing a murdered man&#x27;s voice.<p>Of course after this I finally had CDBaby contact me.<p>The response from their support &#x27;manager&#x27; said simply that my upload has had the claim removed, she was completely unaware or ignorant of what I was referencing since I never said my video was the problem. The fact they were blanket claiming without due diligence or occasional follow-ups to check the accuracy of their claims was the problem.<p>Only after displaying their absolute pathetic avoiding of the topic of legal ramifications for false claims online did I receive a simple follow-up from CDBaby support &#x27;management&#x27;:<p>&quot;All claims have been removed,&quot; and indeed they were, for now.<p>My position on copyright shifted in those months of shouting into the copyright void that is the Youtube/CDBaby scheme.<p>I will break every copyright possible without care.<p>Not just for those who died bravely singing songs for others to be motivated by, but because for-profit entities display far less due diligence in their corporate position than a marijuana smoker does in his hobby.<p>Now I sometimes listen to Ibrahims song, thinking of how many of those people in Hama in the crowd no longer are alive. I think of CDBaby profiting off it and who knows how many others, think of Google&#x27;s complicity in the mess, think of the lawyers who profit off it keeping the situation rolling. I think of the militant US government who is coming closer and closer to making copyrights worse than violent crime, and I get really depressed.<p>That is one of my fights with copyrights.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/HansEriksson"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/HansEriksson</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bambuser.com/channel/syriapioneer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bambuser.com/channel/syriapioneer</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/pyegah.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/pyegah.jpg</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/prkBmh.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/prkBmh.jpg</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZNy7V4Dz60"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZNy7V4Dz60</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Qashoush"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Qashoush</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/R0hnb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/gallery/R0hnb</a><p>[8] www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/world/middleeast/22poet.html?pagewanted=all<p>[9] <a href=""http://www.cdbaby.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdbaby.com/</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu_adzfW8tc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu_adzfW8tc</a><p>Sorry if this is &quot;spam&quot; to some, but this is an information war and I need to say these things.",1377639530

6286465,comment,6285129,6285701,2,0,rdtsc,,,"Good question. Hopefully you have not been put off by that comment. It comes off kind of harsh.<p>She wasn&#x27;t right about lack of concurrency. Go, Scala, Python, hell all of them I guess can do &quot;concurrency&quot;. They all have facilities to launch concurrent requests/actors/callback threads/other processes.<p>Now maybe what she was going to say (and her &quot;how much pain and when&quot; kind of hints in that direction) is that once you start handling large scale concurrency, things get very complicated. Anything that lets you share memory will eventually bite you back in terms of debugging and downtime.<p>Erlang&#x27;s concurrency is unique because its concurrency units are isolated. They are as isolated as possible. Each has its own memory. Garbage collection can happen concurrently. One such what they are called process will not damage or interfere with other processes. That is invaluable.<p>Erlang&#x27;s concurrency just like (Go&#x27;s and Rust&#x27;s I think) is also a mix of both CPU and IO. So behind the scenes Erlang spawns an operating system thread for each CPU core and then it dynamically scales your concurrency units over them. You need to run better, just add more cores.<p>Another (and this should be the main differentiation) is fault tolerance. This was and is the raison-d-etre for Erlang. Nothing practical out there matches it. Processes can and will crash and Erlang has standard ways to supervise and restart. Even crazier it provides built in facilities to reload the code while the system is running. That is of course possible in other frameworks and languages but in Erlang is baked in and battle tested over many years.<p>That sort of makes Erlang a unique tool. It doesn&#x27;t come without trade-offs. It doesn&#x27;t for example has terribly fast sequential speed. So if your task is to multiply matrices for example, or computer lots of numbers. Erlang won&#x27;t be the fastest in that regard. It is also a functional language. It is beautiful I think, especially if you like pattern matching, but some people don&#x27;t like that.<p>But if you don&#x27;t like the syntax, there is  way out, the same Erlang virtual machine called BEAM can run other languages. For example a nice new one is Elixir <a href=""http://elixir-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elixir-lang.org/</a> check it out, it is rather similar to Ruby in syntax but includes all the concurrency features from Erlang.<p>As for resources I would recommend the wonderful and funny online book called:<p>Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good <a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyousomeerlang.com/</a>",1377639444

If instincts were truly passed on as memories, then they should be present throughout life and not appear when such evolutionary adaption is needed. This conflicts with evolutionary developmental psychological theory, which suggests that people face different survival adaptive problems at various points of their lifetime. For example, problems of survival as an infant must occur before problems of mating. Mating must predictably occur before parenting, and likewise before grand-parenting. From this, we expect certain &quot;instincts&quot; to appear and disappear as adaptive problems change. This is known to be true in infants: two examples are an infant&#x27;s ability to swim (which disappears after 6 months) and also the Moro reflex, a potentially lifesaving reflex that occurs while falling. If these were &quot;memories&quot; and not instincts, then they would not appear so rapidly nor so consistently.

We see a typically less gullible set of subjects for these anecdotes, but that can unfortunately be explained entirely by the more plausible sounding hypothesis.<p>I&#x27;ll dispense with the full Bayesian treatment here, but what we have here is a case of the base rate fallacy (although not the form that is usually discussed): failing to account for the prior probability of the evidence. That is, we have some evidence, which is that the anecdotes we see are largely in favor of standing desks being helpful, and we need to account for how likely that evidence is <i>regardless</i> of whether standing desks <i>are</i> helpful.<p>Unfortunately, as our friends with the magnetic bracelets demonstrate, that probability turns out to be very high. If something works, we see overwhelmingly positive anecdotes. If it doesn&#x27;t work, we see overwhelmingly positive anecdotes.<p>Why might this be? Well, for one thing, there is sensitivity to placebo effects, because have purely qualitative phenomena that are being reported only subjectively.<p>But even stronger is a selection bias that has to do with people&#x27;s behavior in reporting and reading. Someone is unlikely to write about their experiences publicly who tries a standing desk for a while, finds no significant benefit, and goes back to a sitting desk. She won&#x27;t find it interesting to talk about, and she may also be self-conscious that she didn&#x27;t do it right, and would be inviting criticism. After all &quot;I tried X and it didn&#x27;t work&quot; is, on some level, an admission of personal failure, and people aren&#x27;t particularly prone to those. And if she does write it up, her write-up isn&#x27;t likely to get all that much attention because &quot;X didn&#x27;t work for me&quot; isn&#x27;t a particularly interesting story.<p>But one who finds the standing desk to be a miracle cure for all of her problems is relatively likely to write about it, and people will take notice, because &quot;making a simple lifestyle change improved my quality of life&quot; is an attention getter.",1377638951

Layoffs in non-union shops are not done by seniority (Talking manufacturing here) they are done by relatively objective measures of employee &quot;goodness&quot; things like attendance, piece productivity, safety procedure compliance, etc.  We (in manufacturing) know this before the layoffs occur and account for it in financial and strategic planning.  We also account for it when hiring starts again.  Not only will skill levels go down, but far from the new folks arriving with universally great attitudes and work ethics after having been unemployed for a while, the incoming workers on average will be significantly less productive attitude wise than the existing workforce.  This will only gradually improve until the next downturn. The newly hired who are truly terrible will probably get fired in the interim, the newly hired who are mediocre will bump along and be the first out the door during the next layoff.  (And yes, the sad truth is that cyclical layoffs are a fact of life for many manufacturing workers)<p>I assume that this would apply in other industries as well.",1377638734

Even thought I have attempted to keep talk on things such as the &quot;Syrian Electronic Army&quot; and their hacks discussion has been forcefully muted.<p>In a now deaded article on the probable chemical attack on Zamalka Syria, I made some comments about my covering the area before[1]. I detailed the location of some of the aggressors on the suburb as well[2].<p>In the second comment I linked to some footage from Zamalka years ago when open protest was still allowed, much like other Syrian cities people were out in mass after Friday prayer.<p>In the first comment I posted a panoramic stitch[3] I made from video of an attack on Zamalka from al-Assad neighborhood above it, there is military and officer housing along with artillery and howitzer army space behind it[4].<p>I also spoke of sectarian cleansing that has been documented in Homs and other areas,[5] where general bombardment and artillery siege displaces Sunnis while Alawite families are moved in to shore up military supply lines.<p>This latest attack on the fringes of Damascus represent something significant, obvious now due to the reactions it has obtained from other nations. Neighborhoods like al-Assad and Moadamiyet al-Shams have loyalist housing where civilians where brought back to be lynched,[6] and they are now nearing the direct lines of fire. So all attempts are being made to halt the advance to where Assad&#x27;s war criminals roost, such as mass gassing of residential neighborhoods around it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6248545"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6248545</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6248433"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6248433</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/XM85Q1q.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/XM85Q1q.jpg</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&lat=33.551696&lon=36.378479&z=13&m=b&show=/24019366/Dhahiyat-al-Asad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&lat=33.551696&lon=36.378479&z=...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/syrian-army-renews-offensive-homs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/syrian-army-ren...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://storyful.com/stories/41049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://storyful.com/stories/41049</a>",1377638228

Every account hell banned, quite annoyed.<p>Repost:<p>The prolific SEA[1] has been responsible for many hacks when their aim went wider than tracking domestic dissidents via internet monitoring with hardware from BlueCoat[2]. Logs[3] leaked by dissident supporting Telecomix[4] from this BlueCoat hardware for example show filters set to monitor the religious and sexual habits of all traffic routed through the datacenter they were installed in.<p>After Assad deployed his military forces SEA started to become a more public facing entity, taking on media firms due to perceived slights in reporting and others to cull more user information to further track targets. A short time-line from Wikipedia:<p>April 2013: The SEA hijacked the Associated Press Twitter account and falsely claimed the White House had been bombed and President Barack Obama injured.<p>May 2013: The ITV news London Twitter account was hacked on the 24th May 2013 by the SEA. The Android applications of British Broadcaster Sky News were also hacked on 26 May 2013 on Google Play Store.<p>July 2013, Truecaller servers were allegedly hacked into by the Syrian Electronic Army.<p>August 2013: Advertising service Outbrain was hacked by the SEA via a spearphishing attack.

6286325,comment,6285231,6285231,14,0,TaylorAlexander,,,"Hey HN! I&#x27;m the creator and co-founder of this project. I&#x27;ve been designing robots since I was 15 and hacking on electronics since I could hold a screwdriver. What I think you&#x27;ll like most about this project is the open source long range encrypted wireless link our mesh provides. I discovered Hacker News about a year ago and have been a regular reader since, so I remember Cryptocat, the NSA, and all the other things that reminded us why cryptography is important, and why implementing it is critical.<p>So, a few answers:<p>Yes, you can do encrypted mesh networks over long range. I&#x27;m a hardcore robotics guy at heart - the name &quot;Flutter&quot; was chosen exactly because this protocol is designed to be as lightweight as possible, and though the mesh protocol itself is still being developed (basically, that&#x27;s why we need kickstarter, aside from the fact that I&#x27;m tired of ramen), I really intend for the protocol to stay out of the way. You&#x27;ll also have full control over what happens, so you can always turn meshing off and use hard addressing. It&#x27;s still really simple to use that way and cheaper than everything else I&#x27;ve seen that compares.<p>I absolutely will not sell a product as &quot;cryptographically secure&quot; unless I believe it is, and I understand that the &quot;smallest&quot; flaw in a cryptographic system can render the entire system worthless. I am learning everything I can about cryptography, starting with some amazing e-books I have found on the subject, and just like wireless<p>Our data rate is proportional to our range (this is generally true for any radio system), so we get 1km range at low data rates (1200baud tested, but we physically ran out of test room and had a strong signal). Theoretically this radio can do 3km at 1200 baud and it looks like we should be able to do 1km at 30kbps at least. Also I think the new radio chip doubles all the data rates in these cases (I would have to confirm), and I do know the new chip has higher transmit power and higher sensitivity, so range should be even better.<p>There is a cheap radio amplifier (PA and LNA) called the CC1190, and texas instruments has all kinds of datasheets on using either of the two radios we are working with to give us 10km range, or much better data rates at 1km, etc. We&#x27;re going to design the protocol with expansion in that direction in mind, if people really dig the range thing (it&#x27;s a bit much for a beer brew setup, but if you want dark meshnets, lets do it!)<p>I&#x27;m a hacker at heart. I first learned lockpicking at the old Noisebridge location (the original one). I love 3D printers and open source, did a rant/thread about open hardware on the Ultimaker mailing list a year back (I was one of the first in the bay area to get an Ultimaker too, and designed a new mount for it that I have on thingiverse). I got on hackaday for some 3d printed helicopter blades, and have been building robots since I was 15. There&#x27;s a longer bio about me on our site, at flutterwireless.com<p>See also me ten years ago talking about robots (and I feel silly for the &quot;few people do&quot; comment, but I was 15 and trying to keep it simple).

Not likely I know, but platforms that developers depend on such as Windows, Windows Phone, .NET, Azure etc - should be something he runs. The Microsoft dev community has deep respect for and a strong relationship with very few people and he is far and above the most central of those figures.<p>The communal touch points that DE folks used to be so good at are gone now, I have about 5 or 6 close friends in my region all of whom are all like myself, independent consultants using MS stack, none of us have heard from our DE in years. User group support has vanished, local meetups where the DE will come show us and teach us stuff used to happen at least every quarter and even more often - have not seen one in years. What I do see are sales people who are only interested in talking to me if I can push Sharepoint Enterprise into a large company. Nevermind that it does not make sense, nevermind that developers by and large despise Sharepoint, that is what matters right now to them. It should be the other way around.<p>Also, if they are going to dangle money out there as an incentive to developers to build Windows 8 and Windows Phone apps, it should be incentive, not token. You want me to stop working and build something great - give me a way to propose it and a budget and if Redmond thinks the idea is good, fund it. Not some 5K in advanced revenue shit. There are tens of thousands of highly talented developers who love the Microsoft stack who would build amazing new experiences for Windows and Windows Phone if someone could help them do so and the current incentives are just laughable. iOS and Android are lotteries that could let me win big, if I am going to gamble my future I am going to do it there. But if Microsoft created an incubator system that let me propose an idea, get it funded and guide me through the process and ultimately help to promote the app - they would have developers fighting to get in.",1377637774

For comparison, the wifi hardware in your laptop typically outputs around 100-200 milliwatts.<p>Edit: TI appears to have a &quot;range extender&quot; part (i.e. a power amp) that can kick the output power up to +27 dBm (500 mW) at the band that they&#x27;re using.

In particular, a ton of academics argue that encryption (e.g. vanilla AES) by itself isn&#x27;t very useful, and authenticated encryption [1] should be the default offered to standard users. There are multiple ways to achieve this, your hardware may support AE modes like GCM or others.<p>Keep in mind that crypto&#x27;s only half the battle, and even &quot;perfectly valid&quot; crypto can still leave your platform vulnerable to things like replay attacks [2]. e.g. lets say someone uses your board as a doorbell: a crafty attacker can sniff the doorbell packet and replay it constantly if you don&#x27;t use something like a request counter.<p>Point is: you shouldn&#x27;t make your users cobble those steps together, they&#x27;ll get them wrong. You&#x27;re in fact very likely to get them wrong yourself, if (as you say) you&#x27;re still learning the ins and outs of crypto. I wish you the best of luck, but keep in mind that you have a long journey ahead of you. I&#x27;d particularly recommend you complete the Matasono crypto challenge [3] before you even think of trying your hands on raw crypto primitives.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption</a>

However. 
If you are standing at a desk you are most likely going to be making micro changes to your stance throughout which will act as a muscular pump, returning blood to your heart and reducing the venous pressure in your legs.<p>Surgeons for example are not at significantly higher risk than the average person for development of varicose veins because they are generally making small movements fairly consistently.
A guard in a pillbox outside Windsor castle, on the other hand, would be at a higher risk because he is not supposed to be making the micromovements that will return the blood and reduce venous pressure, potentially causing valvular incompetence and dilated superficial leg veins specially if predisposed genetically.<p>Source: med student, asked lecturers about this specifically and have talked to numerous surgeons.<p>And as someone in the article mentioned, using compression stockings would obviate any concerns that a person may have",1377637676

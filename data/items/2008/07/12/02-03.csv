Actually, it was possible a few days back to post it on the web and not get indexed by Google or any other search engine. The solution was to make an embedded flash slide show on the webpage and post the link here, but now since they are going to start indexing flash files too, the idea loses hand-down.  :)<p>But surely there must be some sort of solution to post it on the web and not get indexed. Google will surely not index flash videos. Or why create a locked page and then specify the password here. Google then cannot index your file :)",1215830485

244237,comment,243453,244183,0,0,SingAlong,,,"Hey! I had never heard of Jaanix. Thanks for mentioning that. It's interesting. Its like some twitter for news, minus the phone syncing(I summed it up like this when I saw the follow button for news keywords).<p>But I couldn't figure out what the ""follow [keyword]"" button does. I clicked it. AndChecked the FAQs but found nothing. Even their FAQ page has voting system. A bit weird. They should have had a normal FAQ page.<p>The sliding bars on the homepage to customise the news you want is good. But I am able to notice a bug in it. I am using Firefox-3 on windowsXP and when I click on a sliding bar, the marker moves to the position, but the green shade seems to be somewhere else. I had to do around 10 clicks to get the green shade and the marker to coincide (surely had some fun with it).<p>And whenever I changed the slider the news gets optimised by Ajax. That's cool again.<p>I noticed they allow public voting on their news items. They are easily exposed to 'click' spam. Not requiring users to signup to vote actually seems like wanting to be spammed.<p>And I also found out that they don't requires users to signup to comment. Seems like some sort of Open Digg or Open Reddit.<p>But one thing I found nice on Jaanix was that their youtube channel(not sure what they call it) at <a href=""http://www.jaanix.com/youtube"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jaanix.com/youtube</a> they have this 'quick review' kind of feature for the videos. Just place your cursor on the video thumbnail and you will see more thumbnails of the video.<p>Well, Jaanix or Digg or Reddit, they are all cool for user submitted news. Maybe all the other mainstream news might also be subbmitted. But you don't see all mainstream news there. You might surely find out the Release date for iPhone 10G on Digg, but there are surely some news items that don't reach the top stories even in the section news.\nThose are covered by mainstream news fellas. In simple words, you can make a pizza at home. It'll surely be tasty. But still you will like McDonald's Pizza. It's like... two different good tastes, so you like both :)<p>And still I haven't found any source except Google News Search feeds for personalized mainstream news.<p>What I mean by mainstream news is - news by news agencies like Associated Press etc (I don't know what these agencies are called).<p>But your point is right. People will surely find that they are interested is more stuff when they follow something randomly. Again: all that's going to be featured on the front page of Y! is celeb gossip for sure. Not everyone likes celeb gossip. So its going to be forcing people to read celeb gossip. I would rather read news on any other source like Digg or Google News or Jaanix (as you said random news is good).<p>I have a Q and also and A:\nWhy did Yahoo choose celeb news over any other topic?\nBecause they found that they would get more news news in the celeb news category than any other. Which translates to more links, which in turn translates to more clicks and then more money.<p>On one hand they have a really cool thing like BOSS and the other they have a plain stupid idea of dollars from celeb gossip.",1215829697
244236,comment,244014,244014,0,0,neovive,,,"I think web development is comparable to most other service industries.  The core concepts change very slowly over time, but the tools and technologies used for implementation evolve much more rapidly and practitioners must keep pace with ""relevant"" changes (ignoring the noise, of course).<p>Here are some examples:<p>1) Auto Repair: The fundamental elements of a car (wheels, engine, pedals, brakes) change very little over time.  However, the implementation or these elements changes rapidly.<p>2) Medicine: The fundamentals of biology don't change often, but advances in medical devices requires additional training.<p>3) Construction: Once you get past hammers, nails, and the basics; the tools and materials change often.  You also need to be aware of new building codes and regulations.<p>4) Accounting:  New accounting rules and regulations are passed each year and require additional training.<p>There are probably many more good examples as well.  The key point being that those who are passionate about their particular field will be motivated to continue learning -- leveraging their experience to remain successful.",1215829590

I didn't sign up for gigtide, because the killer feature for resume sites like this is to be able to send out via email in all of: text, rtf, word, pdf, html.  Having a nifty profile with a sort of interactive resume feel to it is good (and right up LinkedIn's alley), but it has to export in all those formats seamlessly or it defeats the purpose (yet one more resume format).",1215829589

Make sure you fit with the research and social philosophies of a program before applying if you can, and certainly before accepting an offer.<p>As you leave school and prepare to enter industry or academia, my experience has generally been that the strength of the recommendations backing you matters far more than whatever rank your institution may have.<p>As you mentioned AI/machine learning, I believe these factors are even more important. There are some very distinct schools of thought when it comes to those things, so  make sure you look for philosophical compatibility when picking programs. AI has a few deep schisms and widely separated sub-fields, so tread carefully.<p>It may be worth it to consider some of these: What's your philosophy of mind? Symbolic/statistical/neural? How important is biology/neuroscience when looking at artificial intelligence? What general approach to AI/machine learning most interests you?",1215828927

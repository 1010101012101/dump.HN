During this time I was required to assist a team from Accenture who had won a contract to write some software that needed to be integrated with a number of systems.<p>Accenture had ""all their best people"" on the job. This meant almost an entire floor of staff; managers, project managers, BAs, god knows what else. Oh, they also had two young devs, you know, to actually do the work. These two guys were nice, seemed pretty smart, but fresh out of uni had no experience at all and were just so far out of their depth it was embracing. I tried to help them where I could, but didn't get much opportunity.<p>Accenture originally gave a timeframe of three years for this project, but when I left they were two years in and still not even a working demo in sight. I have no idea if it was ever completed or what happened",1307624145

2636926,comment,2634821,2635474,1,0,DanielStraight,,,"Being logical may matter... but I don't think it's the <i>most important feature</i>, as I said. Creating a perfectly logical language doesn't make it obviously valuable to most people. The underlying premise of Lojban is, more or less, that the problem with natural languages is that they're too illogical. Lojban fixed that problem and, relatively speaking, no one cared.<p>Lots of people hear of Esperanto and decide to pick it up. Almost no one hears of Lojban and picks up. Lots of people are fluent in Esperanto. Perhaps no one is fluent in Lojban. Granted Esperanto had a huge head-start, but I don't think you can attribute its relative success entirely to that factor.<p>Lojban is still missing something, despite being perfectly logical. English, on the other hand, is flourishing despite being extremely illogical. English is one of the most successful and least logical languages on Earth. Lojban is one of the least successful and most logical languages on Earth.

Hacking  inherently malicious acts.<p>Any legally-questionable thing the MIT hackers did was either because a) They were really fascinated in the system (the phone hacks they <i>did</i> do were not to screw over the phone company, but rather to see how the phone system was put together). b) They felt that something was inhibiting their ability to hack efficiently (see also: The Midnight Computer Wiring Society that (illegally) rewired the TX-0 to have more instructions; all the lock hacking that took place since ""Information Wants to be Free""...)<p>And the hacking of MIT and rms and esr and HN is <i>at best</i> tangentially related to the PlayStation cracking that's been taking place.",1307623860
2636922,comment,2630867,2635849,1,0,6ren,,,"I like how you qualify program length as a fallible measure (<i>they're more guidelines</i>). Similar to your story of overdoing <i>tiny classes and short methods, due to a belief from programmers you admired</i>, I once dogmatically followed this as a rule, always extracting code than was used more than once, and only doing so then. I think that's a standard learning stage, where you learn something, over-apply it, then learn  distinctions for when it is appropriate and when not.<p>Optimizing for length is only one criteria - optimizing for clarity is more important (strange observation: in writing, redundancy <i>enhances</i> communication); optimizing for flexibility/change is another. I like the idea of just expressing your current understanding, very simply - not weighed with suspect prophecies. Change it as your understanding improves; as you reuse it. Brooks observed that having a spec and different implementations leads to a more robust spec; and there's an idea of not generalizing code until after you're implemented it three times, for different purposes. This is the opposite of architecture astronautics - being grounded in actual instances of concrete experience.<p>So, I give up a simple, single theory of how to code, and I'm lost - which is perhaps an accurate appraisal of our current understanding of programming. Only the actual details of a problem guide you.<p>From what you said elsewhere, I think the simple key is to keep focusing on the problem, not the program. My old supervisor said I was over-concerned with theory.  ""<i>Look at the data!</i>"" he admonished me.",1307623823

2636851,comment,2636745,2636745,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"The problems with Bitcoin:<p>1. Even though the tech may be solid and the idea's appealing, Bitcoin itself has a sleazy feel about it, especially because of its side effect of enriching early adopters. It feels and looks like a pyramid scheme. About a third of the Bitcoins that will ever exist in our lifetime already exist; who the fuck wants to get into a game where 1/3 of the wealth has already allocated? People are buying BTC now because they don't want to be left out (panic buying) of something that might hit it big, but as a currency, I don't think it has legs. And when Bitcoin fails to be actually useful, the value will drop... just as $100+ Magic cards will be useless circa 2050.<p>2. A parallel Bitcoin currency could be created using the same technologies and there would be no distinction that makes one the better currency than the other. It's like the MillionDollarHomePage: special because it was the first one. An easy way to blow out Bitcoin is to create a currency that can actually be exchanged for something useful, like cloud computing services or crowdsourcing, at defined rate (i.e. 1 Q-coin = 24 hours of CPU time on a 3 GHz processor). Note that the currency doesn't need to be pegged to something that most users care about; it just needs to be pegged to something useful to some people. For example, the dollar is useful because you can buy groceries with it, and you can buy groceries with it because grocery stores need dollars to meet existing obligations (taxes, wages, merchandise).<p>Since absolutely nothing stops a new entrant from coming up with a new ""crypto-currency"", if this idea is successful, someone will come up with one that isn't so harshly deflationary.<p>3. Bitcoin is going up because it's pissing people (namely, the U.S. government) off, and this is popping its market value-- temporarily. When you're a new entrant, there's no such thing as bad publicity. That's not a good motion to invest on, however.<p>4. My understanding is that the software, at least as it is now, relies on data files stored on one's hard drive in a ""wallet file"". That's bad. Hard drives die all the time. I would certainly not store an asset of $100+ in value on my hard drive. People can upload to the cloud, but that raises the same trust issues (for some people) that banks do: do you trust cloud providers? For the record, I trust the cloud providers far more than I trust BofA, but that's me: are the hard-core libertarians going to be smart about their wallet files and back them up, or are they going to lock their hard drives down and then get angry when their hard drives die?<p>5. Liquidity. 1 BTC = $30, so if you have 10,000 BTC, you have $300,000, right? Wrong. Selling those 10,000 BTC means that you'll get filled at a lower price-- possibly much lower. You might dry out all the liquidity available and get filled at ridiculously low prices (i.e. screwed). On top of that, Bitcoin is such a small economy (with the currency's value rooted in <i>nothing</i>) that a 10,000 BTC sell-off just might trigger a crash. Who knows? It's not something I'd want to bet my life savings on.<p>If you want to put a few hundred dollars into BTC, go ahead. I would have done it myself at $1 or even $5, acknowledging that I might be wrong and there is potential upside (although I think it's very unlikely to hit). But investing money in BTC that you can't afford to never get back is a really <i>bad</i> idea.",1307622378

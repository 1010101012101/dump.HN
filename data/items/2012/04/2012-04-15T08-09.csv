As someone has worked in the ebook sector for close to 10 years, the publishers (with a few notable exceptions) continue to dig a deeper hole for themselves. The three main problems in the ebook sector are:<p>- DRM, Territoriality, The Agency Model introduced in 2010<p>The problems of DRM have already been covered in detail.<p>Regarding territoriality, we have ridiculous set of restrictions about who we, as a retailer, can sell an ebook to. A large publishing house will have separate entities setup in the US, Candada, the UK and Australia. Each one of these produces the same ebook that can be sold in a restricted set of countries at different prices. This causes all kinds of complications. Take for example a US citizen who in the army who is trying to purchase an ebook in Afghanistan. Do we rely on their IP address or credit card when determining whether they're allowed the book? The is a litany of other examples where territoriality complicates things helping no one, not even the people imposing it.<p>By 2010 Amazon had cut prices on ebooks to a level where they were losing money on each sale. Their strategy was fairly clear, build a large user base locked into their platform, bankrupt the competition then strong-arm the publishers to get a larger cut of the profits. The publishers freaked out and imposed a new model in the US where all ebook retailers were considered agents and couldn't discount their books; fixed prices across all retailers.<p>This move means that the publishers have complicated their own business model to the extent where they can't handle it. Taxes down to the city level must be applied to any ebook sales made with the US. The publishers are struggling to ensure all their distributors are complying with fixed prices and Amazon is monitoring this situation closely. How come retailer X is not complying with your fixed pricing but we have to? The publishers are fearing lawsuits with good reason.<p>I don't know what the answer is. Our only options as an indie retailer is to pursue a mobile based reading experience on either android, wp7 or through the browser (DRM problems come into play here). Everyone has been pushed off IOS since August last year when Apple imposed a 30% commission on any purchases made through an app. This 30% is exactly the same percentage that retailers receive as an agent.",1334478319

On Windows OS, DVD can be played with a variety of players. Instead, we can copy DVD onto hard drive for further playing, or even rip DVD through some built-in tools or open-source free software such as Handbrake supporting free DVD video conversion.<p>Handbrake can provide good effect when converting DVD to some video formats like MP4 (M4V for Apple users). However, this free DVD ripper has not been supportable for encrypted DVD directly. Some third-party tool/codec (e.g. VLC) has to be used in conjunction with Handbrake. Despite that, the DVD video output chapters are out of order sometimes.<p>Besides, Handbrake is more suitable for advanced users than new users because it requires manual parameter settings, and is more for Apple users than Windows users because it runs more stably on OS X. In these senses, Handbrake is not an ideal free DVD ripping program for Windows 8.<p>A Free DVD Ripper more Suitable for Windows 8/Windows 7
WinX DVD Ripper is a completely free DVD ripper supporting more functions and convenience than Handbrake. Moreover, it better suits Windows OS, including Windows 8, Windows 7 (32 & 64 bit), Win 98, NT, 2000, 2003, XP, Vista (32 & 64 bit), etc.<p>It can remove all common DVD copy protections such as region code, CSS, UOPs, APS, RCE and even Sony ARccOS.<p>Outstanding Feature of WinX Free DVD Ripper: Fast
The most outstanding feature of WinX Free DVD Ripper can be identified as its fast speed. The ripping speed is mainly attributed to Super Encode Engine based on MMX- SSE & 3DNow and Hyper-Threading Technology that support converting feature-length DVD movie in few minutes.<p>It can deliver 3X-5X faster DVD ripping speed compared with the like free ripping programs. Therefore, WinX DVD Ripper is a free DVD ripping software that can fast rip DVD to Windows 8 and Windows 7.<p>Tutorial on Free DVD Rip for Win 8 (or Other Windows OS)
To begin with, please download Windows version of WinX DVD Ripper for free and fast ripping DVD on Windows 8. This 100% clean and safe freeware contains no malware, no adware, no spyware, or the related.<p>Follow the simple instructions to install it.<p>Step 1: Launch this free DVD ripper on your Windows 8 computer before or after you insert the source DVD to your DVD-ROM. Then click DVD Disc button on the UI to import the DVD movie.<p>Step 2: Select your target video formats.

2322124,comment,2321838,2321838,0,0,hussong,,,"Thanks for reaching out!  I've been using Ubuntu (currently 10.10 64-bit) as the sole OS on my laptops for the past four years, mostly for email, web, office, and a little front-end coding.<p>I wish it was easier to replace Evolution.  It always felt way too sluggish for me, so I'm using Thunderbird and would love to get the same desktop integration that Evolution has (never bothered to set it up manually).<p>Empathy seems like a decent IM client, yet I'm still using Pidgin to connect to Skype via dbus (Skype for Linux is not very pretty).  Apparently the plugin would work on Empathy as well now, but I was too lazy to set it up.<p>I'm generally too lazy to switch applications after a dist upgrade.  When I don't immediately see a clear migration path for my profile data, I just stick to the old app. I guess that's why I never used F-Spot or Shotwell.<p>Rhythmbox doesn't minimize to tray anymore.  Closing the window leaves it running in the background, but there's no icon in the tray.  Not sure if this is intended or just a glitch on my install after two auto-upgrades.<p>Better support for Tablet PCs would be awesome.  I eventually got everything set up on a X200 Tablet, but it's not much fun going through dozens of mostly outdated forum posts to make screen rotation and pen input work.<p>With all the back-and-forth regarding GNOME/Unity and app selection, I'm debating going for Xfce on the next install.  That being said, the Ubuntu desktop is awesome!  Mac makes me feel stupid and I never ever want to go back to Windows...",1300103894

US forces moved away from the shores due to radiation, Russia is worried about the wind carrying radioactive caesium and iod all the way over to them. As far as I can tell from news coverage, radiation levels did exceed 500 mikro-sievert, at times were as high as 1500.<p>It is just hard to understand what all this really means in terms of risk and how bad the situation really is.

2322100,comment,2321636,2321636,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is really a description of why I'm bored with TechCrunch, not why I'm bored with the Bay Area.<p>The Valley is a lot more than the startup ""scene"".  I just went to the Tech Museum in San Jose today (well, yesterday now).  What struck me - aside from all the ""sponsored by"" notices - is just how much actual, genuine innovation goes on here.<p>Think of all the things that we, as humans, can do now that we couldn't even dream of fifteen years ago.  We have rovers running around on Mars (well, a rover - RIP Spirit), performing experiments and sending back photos in near real-time that can be viewed by millions of people on the Internet.  We can type a few words into our browser and get back information about nearly any topic imaginable.  We can visit any <i>place</i> on Earth, in 3D, from both the air and the ground, without leaving our computer screen.  We have computers that can fit in your pocket with more processing power than $10K servers from 10 years ago.  We can read your entire human genome for a couple hundred bucks, and predict whether you're likely to get one of any number of different diseases.  We can even <i>alter</i> the genes of a living human being to treat several conditions that used to be a death sentence.<p>Now think of how many of those innovations happened in the valley.  Where would we be without NASA, Google, Apple, and Genentech?<p>I believe a lot of the problem is a certain fetishization of startups that's been going on lately, where the important thing is not what you do, but merely that you're a ""startup"".  TechCrunch feeds into that directly, as does SXSW, and I think a lot of the author's problem is that his peer group has essentially bought into the hype cycle.<p>But if you follow the <i>technology</i> and how it can be applied to help humankind, and only consider the ""startup"" aspect later, there's a very different picture.  Because people in the Bay Area are still doing very, very cool things.  The only problem is, they're too busy doing cool things to go publicity hunting.  And there're lots of other people who're doing pretty lame things but have plenty of time to pitch it.  This is how it's always been - at the exact time that Larry and Sergey were working on Google in the garage, Pets.com was raising hundreds of millions in venture capital, and Kozmo.com was delivering goods to your doorstep for well under cost.",1300103259

That way, development and improvement gest more focus: instead of four mediocre, unfinished git frontends, Canonical can pick one and hope the community will make it The Very Best Ever.

The company had always imagined their target market where engineers.<p>But when they did some analysis of their clients they where surprised to find quite a lot of chimney cleaners buying it.<p>It was way beyond what they needed but they found it it made the chimney cleaners feel more sophisticated.<p>The other story he told was about this industrial soap company he had worked for. They had one series of soap that they where betting on. When sales failed they had lots of soap on stock they couldn't get rid of. But one of the guys in the lab had fooled around with this idea about putting this glimmer stuff into the soap.<p>My teacher always having a good intuition for opportunities knew a guy in the retail industry found out that young girls had been slowly but surely more aware of buying their own cleaning products in earlier ages than usually.<p>So what they did was to lower the dryness of the product, make it pink and put in the glimmer. And lo and behold they sold this stuff like candy.<p>Talk about a pivot.<p>My own experience in the advertising industry have had it's surprises too. The biggest one was that in Denmark Audi's where not primarily sold to the cool jetset that the advertising depicted but rather to successful plumbers, blackschmiths, restaurant owners. etc.<p>And this brings up an interesting question.<p>Do people still buy based on what they aspire to be?<p>One thing is for sure though.<p>You have to ""run the program"" before you can see what will happen.",1300102722

(i can't remember the network card I had then). The problem remained with 10.10 (RT3090 card). Network worked for a few minutes and then suddenly stopped and later sometimes worked again...  Comparing this to the Jolicloud installation that 'just worked' is disappointing. I wish you try to improve wireless support a bit further (I know you have done a lot of great work since now, but its still not perfect).<p>The other problem I've had is Compiz (ATI mobility radeon HD 4250). When I enabled the proprietary drivers either it worked nice with No visual effect, or if I chose Some visual effects then chrome of the windows didn't show up until I disabled the effects. \nI have then installed 10.04a3 just to try if things were better but now there was nothing visual at all. No bar, no unity, basically all what required Compiz didn't work. When I boot I see only the background and the cursor. If I knew some shortcuts I guess i could still open the windows (but chromeless), but its very annoying.<p>What I wish for Ubuntu 11 is to polish things up with the hardware. Try to increase hardware support as much as you can, so that users don't have to deal with it.<p>I may be an isolated case with little luck, but its just frustrating. I think increasing hardware compatibility should be a higher priority than UI polish.",1300101737

2322051,comment,2318892,2321868,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""Upper bound implies worst case.""<p>No it doesn't. You can talk about upper bounds on average case running time.  The function under consideration can be <i>any</i> function, best case, worst case, average case, or <i>any other</i> function.<p>O-notation is used to represent ""asymptotic upper bound"" on <i>any</i> function. (Omega-notation for lower bounds, Big Theta for simultaneous lower <i>and</i> upper bounds  and so on, on <i>any</i> function).<p>The upper or lower bounds of  functions have nothing to do with the ""case-iness"" (best/worst/average running times etc) of algorithm running times.<p>The ""meaning"" of the function (or for that matter the argument ""n""), is completely orthogonal to its bounds.\nO(n) by itself does not say anything about what the function represents. The function does not have  to be about algorithms.<p>E.g: It could represent the error between an approximation and actual calculated value. You can  use O notation to bound such functions, to state the upper bounds on the rate of growth of the error of an approximation. (Gilbert Strang uses O notation thus in his book ""Calculus"" for example).<p>As another example, Knuth applies this notation to dozens of  non-algorithm-running-time functions in Chapter 9 of Concrete Mathematics.<p>Even when using such notation to discuss algorithm running times you really have to say O(n log_n) worst case (or best case or average case) running time for e.g, if you want to be clear.<p>Thus (for example)from Cormen et al's ""Introduction to Algorithms"" book, emphasis mine (section 3.1 for anyone interested),<p>""The Big_Theta(n^2) bound <i>on the worst case running time of insertion sort</i>  does not imply a  Big_Theta(n^2) bound on the  running time of the insertion sort on every input.... when the input is already sorted <i>insertion sort runs in Big_Theta(n) time</i>""<p>Big-Theta is applied to both best case <i>and</i> worst case running time functions in the above paragraph and the author clearly specifies what he is applying the bound to in each case.<p>iow btilly is right (about how O notation can be used to represent any function, not just worst case running time functions) and you are wrong (when you say ""Upper Bound implies worst case"" ). As btilly states, this is a  common misconception.<p>Another common abuse of the notation is to use Big-Oh-notation when Big-Theta is intended.",1300101364

I'm sick of it randomly dying whenever it wants to, having to do<p><pre><code>  sudo pkill -9 nm-applet && sudo nm-applet\n</code></pre>\n...a billion times a day. Including <i>always</i> when switching user accounts. It's really bizarre. I'm tempted to use wicd, but the icon for it and UI sucks balls compared to nm-applet. I used to have an alias set to to do most of the dirty work, but in the end it's only a few keystrokes saved; I still have to type in my pass to become sudo, and exit twice to close the terminal.<p>Really gets aggravating when my dad or someone borrows my computer and I have to su -l into my user, go through the whole process above and logout (from shell) all over again. Seems like a ridiculous process just to connect to my wifi.<p>A related issue to this is saner default key management. I've been using Ubuntu since Intrepid, and I've never figured out how to get the default key management to stop bothering me when unnecessary. It's sort of alright that it asks me for the default key on bootup since I change my password around regularly and it's different from the first one I set, yet it for some reason is unable to remember any wifi profiles at all after the first password change.<p>Default apps like Gwibber and Evolution have never worked for me on multiple computers (am using 10.04+ 32 and 64 builds), while their alternatives like Pidgin and Thunderbird or Claws Mail work great and consistently. On the branding side of things, LibreOffice rolls off the tongue better than OpenOffice.org, but still has the pesky, stereotypical problem of open source projects with tacky and alienating names.<p>Applaud you all on your choice with Banshee, better player than Rhythmbox for sure. As long as libmobiledevice is rolled in, I'm happy.<p>Unity is a bold move that you all have already invested quite a bit of development time and energy into, but I unfortunately will not upgrade from 10.04 because of it. It's really alien to me and others whom I introduce Ubuntu to, and I don't really see what problem it aims to fix other than maybe trying to shake up the old UI/UX scene on the desktop from the WIMP to something less...WIMP.<p>Really, the only things I miss the most from Windows and Mac is iTunes Store, which I can view from my iPhone anyways (although it'd be nice on the desktop, but I understand that this completely not your fault but Apple's decision) and high-quality FPS games like Halo that aren't all just a rehashing of the Doom engine.<p>Great work and keep on building a great operating system. Ubuntu's visionary development and support ecosystem is really a marvel that I've enjoyed using and supporting over the years. I really appreciate what you all do at Canonical.<p>Good Luck.<p>EDIT: Also see[1] my comment on the large default icons, fonts, and spacing for everything in Ubuntu. It's been getting worse since 9.04 and all the many thick panels, icons and such really add up to a bad experience and amateurish feel. If you all could explain the need for such large solid-colored bars on both the bottom and top of the page as well as the the thick, solid-colored toolbars in every application (Firefox is a big transgressor here), that'd be great to hear.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2317321"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2317321</a>",1300101279

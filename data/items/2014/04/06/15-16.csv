My wife graduated from U of Iowa in 5 semesters between AP credits and testing out of classes, which allowed her to pay her way by nannying and graduate with no debt. But this strategy is often not possible at private schools, where there are residency requirements.<p>Reducing residency requirements has a particular advantage, which is saving cost of living. My law school alma mater recently started a program to allow people to get a JD in two years. Even though the total tuition is the same, students save $25-30k in loans and interest by not having to pay cost of living the extra year. Cutting out tuition for the third year would be another step forward, but as a first step simply cutting the extra year can reduce costs while remaining revenue neutral for schools. It would also be a good idea to move classes to later in the day, to allow students to have part-time jobs to help pay their expenses.",1396799607

This is for a very large web-based medical practice-management system and tertiary services.  It mostly sits on top of stripped-back ASP.NET, but yes it&#x27;s a framework I developed myself because 9 years ago when this project started ASP.NET was awful.<p>So yeah, whilst it&#x27;s non-standard, it&#x27;s not rocket science, or some bizarre parallel C# universe.  I still need to get data from the server to the client in an efficient way, I still have controllers, server pages, database CRUD, etc.<p>> Objects in C# are mutable by design<p>Objects are mutable by <i>default</i>, but there also exists a keyword called readonly which has been there since v1.0 of C#, so I would argue that it&#x27;s just as much of a language feature.  It not being the default doesn&#x27;t make it any less of a valid approach.  One of the most used library types is immutable: String.<p>> It sounds like your approach is closer to functional programming (but again, I don&#x27;t know the context)<p>I try to follow that route, yes.  Clearly it&#x27;s not always possible because of the limitations of the language or the .NET framework, and that&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;m not going to be dogmatic over it.  I think however that immutability where possible helps code quality overall.<p>> Fields an properties are incompatible? How?\n> See <a href=""http://csharpindepth.com/articles/chapter8/propertiesmatter..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://csharpindepth.com/articles/chapter8/propertiesmatter....</a>. - &quot;Compatibility issues&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s very interesting, but none of those are really issues for me, and I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;d be minor issues for most people too:<p>> You lose binary compatibility<p>We always compile from source<p>>  You can use a field for ref parameters, whereas you can&#x27;t (in C# at least) use a property in the same way.<p>Ref fields are nasty, I wouldn&#x27;t want to see anyone on my team using them.  obviously passing a readonly field to a ref is pretty pointless.  So non-issue for me.<p>> Involving a mutable structs<p>Don&#x27;t use mutable structs.<p>> You lose reflection compatibility<p>Call GetFields instead of GetProperties.  Non-issue internally.  I guess if a 3rd party lib didn&#x27;t support fields then it might be a problem, so far it hasn&#x27;t been.<p>> Achievable with properties (with private setter), so I wouldn&#x27;t count it as a benefit.<p>No it isn&#x27;t, because the method you called could call a <i>method</i> on the object you passed, affecting the underlying state of the object.  If you work on small code-bases and you understand the implications of every function you call then great, but the added peace of mind knowing that this structure you passed to a method isn&#x27;t going to be changed (now or by a programmer in the future) is very powerful.<p>It&#x27;s also makes method signatures tell you explicitly the behaviour of the code within, which makes it easier to look at the surface of a library to know what it does, i.e.:<p><pre><code>    MutableState state = new MutableState(...);\n    MutableLib.DoSomething(state);\n    // ... any code run after DoSomething is now flying-blind, has state changed?\n\n    public class MutableLib\n    {\n        public static void DoSomething(MutableState state)\n        {\n            // What happens here?  Does MutableState get changed?  How can you know when the \n            // method returns &#x27;void&#x27; and takes a mutable object?  You have to look at the code\n            // to know for sure.\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThen the immutable version.  Notice how the signature to DoSomething is explicit in its purpose.<p><pre><code>    ImmutableState state = new ImmutableState(...);\n    var newState = ImmutableLib.DoSomething(state);\n    // ... any code run after DoSomething is entirely aware that state has changed\n\n    public static class ImmutableLib\n    {\n        public static ImmutableState DoSomething(ImmutableState state)\n        {\n            // What happens here?  Well it doesn&#x27;t matter to the caller, they know\n            // they get a new ImmutableState back, and if they chose to ignore it\n            // then the original state object they passed in will be unaltered.\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt also allows for free transactional behaviour with rollbacks, which can be super useful:<p><pre><code>    ImmutableState state = new ImmutableState(...);\n    try\n    {  \t\n    \tvar newState = ImmutableLib.DoSomething(state);\n    \tnewState = ImmutableLib.DoSomethingElse(newState);\n    \tnewState = ImmutableLib.DoAnotherThing(newState);\n\n    \t// Commit\n    \tstate = newState;\n    }\n    catch\n    {\n        // If an exception fires then state won&#x27;t have changed. \n    }\n\n</code></pre>\n> I see where you&#x27;re coming from, but to me you are pointing out the advantages of immutability, not choosing fields over properties.<p>You&#x27;re right that I&#x27;m primarily arguing for immutability, but I would also argue that properties can&#x27;t achieve immutability because the object can always change itself.  A private property can always be changed by a member function.  Clearly you <i>can</i> make classes that are immutable for all intents and purposes by using properties; I just prefer the explicit nature of &#x27;readonly&#x27; - it&#x27;s a language feature to be used in my humble opinion.<p>There&#x27;s also the argument that properties are an extra unnecessary abstraction <i>for this case</i>.  With a readonly field/property it is only set once, so having a layer of getter/setter logic is unnecessary.  You only need that logic once at construction.",1396798960

If I was comparing it against engines like LLVM and Lightning that have their own IR and optimizers I would have also mentioned DynASM&#x27;s advantages compared to them, such as:<p>- DynASM is <i>much</i> smaller: DynASM&#x27;s runtime is something like 2k of object code.  Lightning is more like 150k and LLVM is many times bigger than that.<p>- DynASM is faster: I haven&#x27;t benchmarked against lightning but LLVM is known not to be very fast at JITting, and just the fact that Lightning is performing its own optimizations means that DynASM is probably faster (note that I&#x27;m talking specifically about the speed of doing the code generation itself).<p>- DynASM gives greater control: you have full control over what instructions are emitted.  If you want to play a little fast and loose with calling conventions for speed, you can (I do this in my JIT).  If you want to use SSE/AVX/etc. or other very specialized instructions like x86&#x27;s parsing instructions, you can.<p>Basically, if you already have your own IR and optimizer and you just want a code generator, and want control over what specific processor instructions you are emitting, then DynASM is a great choice.  If you don&#x27;t have your own optimized IR, or you don&#x27;t want to write a separate code generator per platform, and you don&#x27;t mind the size/speed overhead of other engines, then other projects might be a better choice.<p>> The real trick you seem to like is the syntax abstraction, using | as prefix. But normal C can do the same with __asm(string)<p>If you think __asm(string) is the same as DynASM, then you missed the point of the article.<p>__asm(string) is great if you just want to write some static ASM that is fully known at compile time.  But how are you going to use __asm(string) to do this?<p><pre><code>    void emit_mov(int immediate) {\n      // This won&#x27;t work, you can&#x27;t substitute a variable\n      // into an __asm() expression.\n      __asm(&quot;mov eax, immediate&quot;);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSure you could pass the immediate to the ASM via a register, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re trying to do, we&#x27;re trying to build code at runtime.  __asm() won&#x27;t help us with that.<p>> and it&#x27;s easier to use C macros for portable ASM<p>Not sure what you mean by this.  If you&#x27;re talking about a BPF-like approach like I discussed in my article, that&#x27;s not portable and not very readable IMO.",1396798231

If you need more computing power in the loop, you&#x27;d have another smartphone sized device in the patients pocket, getting the wireless feed from the camera, processing it and streaming to the subcutaneous one. But wait, you already have things like the Google Glass that have a camera + enough computing power and wireless capabilities baked in, and <i>ready to be mass produced</i>, thanks Google.<p>Going further, when the electronics get low power enough, the wirelessly charging implantable battery (a bit large, and deadly if it ever leaks, but thankfully not hard to safely case/coat) could be replaced with a glucose fuel cell (not yet available, so stick to the battery for now, but doable in the future according to:  <a href=""http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130322/srep01516/full/srep01516.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130322/srep01516/full/srep01...</a>).<p>Now yes, none of these are &quot;medical grade&quot; or &quot;medically approved&quot; techs or anything, there is real work in putting them together, and the whole biocompat coating is again existing tech, you just need the expertise of an existing implantable devices manufacturer, but it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a matter of glueing together some existing parts.

If you&#x27;re feeling generous (and notice this comment 6 days later, heh), would you mind correcting my mental model and slicing up the difference between NAT and firewall?<p>Suppose that there is one external ip, we&#x27;ll say 1.1.1.1 which is NATting two internal ips, 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2.  When a packet comes in, say a TCP packet attempting to open a connection on port 80, what are the options that a non-firewalling NAT has to figure out which internal ip to route it to? Assume that both ips are running webservers.<p>I know of two answers to this question, one is port forwarding, where the NAT is explicitly configured to forward incoming port 80 traffic to one of the internal hosts (meaning that only one of them can listen for traffic on a given port). The other doesn&#x27;t work for new incoming connections but just has the NAT watching for outgoing traffic and allowing incoming traffic to come back (using  (foreign ip, receiving port, sending port) up to route packets to the internal IP that started that conversation). My understanding is that NAT traversal techniques typically try to first ask the NAT to forward a port for them (uPnP / NAT-PMP), and if that fails then they try to exploit the second method using ICE.<p>What am I missing?",1396797535

It is neither allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it put down roots (into the past) and threw out unexpected branches: but its main theme was settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of the Ring as the link between it and The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, &quot;The Shadow of the Past&#x27;, is one of the oldest parts of the tale. It was written long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster, and from that point the story would have developed along essentially the same lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before in mind, or in some cases already written, and little or nothing in the war that began in 1939 or its sequels modified it.</i><p><i>The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusion. If it had inspired or directed the development of the legend, then certainly the Ring would have been seized and used against Sauron; he would not have been annihilated but enslaved, and Barad-dûr would not have been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, would in the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-styled Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves.</i><p><i>Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those who like allegory or topical reference. But I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse &#x27;applicability&#x27; with &#x27;allegory&#x27;; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.</i><p>(I&#x27;ve been listening to the LotR audiobook during my walks in the woods etc. recently.

7541150,comment,7538695,7540662,2,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Or is it just your personal opinion?&quot;<p>Of course it is. But contrary to the occasional Erlang syntax defender, after 8 years of use I still find it klunky. It&#x27;s klunky enough that I find myself frequently having to override a desire to do something the easy, wrong way rather than the harder, right way. I consider this a great sin.<p>&#x27;Let’s go to the next point where you claim that Erlang is a “bad” functional language. What does that mean? “Bad”?&#x27;<p>It makes everything functional a real pain. Yes, you can pass functions around, but the syntax is klunky and annoying enough that you don&#x27;t want to do it. Practical usage of Erlang ends up using it as an imperative language with a &quot;strange&quot; restriction against using the same variable twice (leading to the very common Result, Result1 = Something(Result), Result2 = SomethingElse(Result2), etc pattern), not as a functional language. Compare the structure of Erlang code with other functional languages; Erlang looks more like imperative code than functional code. It&#x27;s a bad functional language. It&#x27;s a decent enough language itself, but it&#x27;s not a good functional language.<p>And let me pull that out and emphasize that... I&#x27;m not looking at the theoretical design issues of the language, I am looking at <i>what code comes out</i> in the real world. Erlang is not programmed functionally. In fact you could strip it out entirely, allow in-process &quot;mutation&quot;, and as long as you prevented processes from being able to share any data, you would not notice the difference, excepting that your code might get simpler. As near as I can tell, virtually nothing would require any significant rearchitecting, or indeed even any API changes to speak of. It&#x27;s entirely incidental to the <i>real</i> considerations of total process isolation and message passing. Erlang is programmed procedurally, with isolation between actors being the primary isolation tool.<p>&#x27;As a user of both languages I have no idea what you mean when you say “there&#x27;s still some nice aspects of the Erlang language as compared to Go, you&#x27;ve still gotten quite a bit of the Erlang value out of Go”.&#x27;<p>In terms of learning multiple paradigms, if you&#x27;re already intimately familiar with Go, Erlang won&#x27;t teach you very much.<p>&quot;Only someone without experience in the languages would say that the concurrency in Erlang is like the one in Go.&quot;<p>I have extensive experiences in both. On the grand scale of things, they are fairly similar. Locally they have a lot of differences, but designs come out fairly similar in both cases. Compare with the incredible differences that you get in Haskell designs, or conventional threading designs. With just a bit of grease code added to Go, you can straight-up <i>port</i> an Erlang design to a Go design. This would not be optimal in Haskell, and not be practical in a pthreads&locking-based world or an event-based world like Node, both of which would exert significant pressures to structure your code in other ways.<p>Again, I am looking at how the designs come out, not the theoretical considerations.<p>I think perhaps the perspective difference here is that I&#x27;ve also got a great deal <i>more</i> than just Erlang and Go under my belt. For all the superficial differences, if you already know one, if you&#x27;re out to get a lot of experience in the different languages in the world, you&#x27;re better off learning something else entirely than go learn the other. Erlang has some advantages on the crash-first front and multi-node stuff, but they aren&#x27;t open-your-eyes perspective changing the way that, say, your first encounter with closures are, or a read-through of the SICP is.<p>You missed the biggest practical difference between the languages, which is that Go&#x27;s synchronization primitives default to synchronous and Erlang&#x27;s to asynchronous. I find that dominates most of the other differences you listed. As opposed to issues like garbage collection, which hardly even enter your mind until you&#x27;ve got a system larger than what your average Go programmer will encounter. (Mine is, though, but even then it&#x27;s not stopping me.)<p>For that matter, my experience is that Erlang&#x27;s multi-node stuff is a bit oversold. Less is provided that is often claimed (you certainly do not simply write idiomatic Erlang code and get a multi-node capable system; you must <i>write</i> a multi-node capable system, Erlang just gives you a few primitives. Useful, but nowhere near a complete solution.) and I personally have had huge stability problems with Mnesia for years. It just likes to stop clustering sometimes, for no apparent reason, on machines sharing a switch, multiple times a week, on a load that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.",1396796522

When you&#x27;re 10, a whole year is increasing your life by 10%. That&#x27;s a huge percentage of your life. By the time your 60, that year is a much much smaller percentage. Thinking of it like that, it&#x27;s not surprising that 10% of your life seems longer than ~1%.",1396796494

I'm competent enough to use ssh and command line to do basic things, but beyond that I have some trouble.

It makes pushing code via git as easy as it is for heroku, but it is more flexible, i.e. allows file uploads w/o using s3, you can use mysql or postgres (heroku only allows postgres without another service). It's been overall a good experience, very little down time. Heroku might be better for certain things, but webbynode has been perfect for my needs.<p>It's not free though - lowest plan is $15 per month. I know digital ocean starts as low as $5 per month.

Over the 10 years, that means that the first person makes about $1.078 million, while the second makes $1.198 million - a difference of $120k before taxes.

4645741,comment,4644463,4644556,9,0,gwern,,,"> This must once have been true of seatbelts too, before all the experiments that were done with dummies and cadavers.<p>Surprisingly enough, it was true of airbags <i>after</i> those experiments too: in the late '80s and early '90s, it was noticed that the airbag fatality rate was shockingly high compared to what had been projected, so they went back to the drawing boards and revised the designs. A quote from a RAND study on autonomous cars:<p>> This tension produced ""a standoff between airbag proponents and the automakers that resulted in contentious debates, several court cases, and very few airbags"" (Wetmore, 2004, p. 391). In 1984, the US DOT passed a ruling requiring vehicles manufactured after 1990 to be equipped with some type of passive restraint system (e.g., air bags or automatic seat belts) (Wetmore, 2004); in 1991, this regulation was amended to require air bags in particular in all automobiles by 1999 (Pub. L. No. 102-240). The mandatory performance standards in the FMVSS further required air bags to protect an unbelted adult male passenger in a head-on, 30 mph crash. Additionally, by 1990, the situation had changed dramatically, and air bags were being installed in millions of cars. Wetmore attributes this development to three factors: First, technology had advanced to enable air-bag deployment with high reliability; second, public attitude shifted, and safety features became important factors for consumers; and, third, air bags were no longer being promoted as replacements but as supplements to seat belts, which resulted in a sharing of responsibility between manufacturers and passengers and lessened manufacturers' potential liability (Wetmore, 2004). While air bags have certainly saved many lives, they have not lived up to original expectations: In 1977, NHTSA estimated that air bags would save on the order of 9,000 lives per year and based its regulations on these expectations (Thompson, Segui-Gomez, and Graham, 2002). Today, by contrast, NHTSA calculates that air bags saved 8,369 lives in the 14 years between 1987 and 2001 (Glassbrenner, undated). Simultaneously, however, it has become evident that air bags pose a risk to many passengers, particularly smaller passengers, such as women of small stature, the elderly, and children. NHTSA (2008a) determined that 291 deaths were caused by air bags between 1990 and July 2008, primarily due to the extreme force that is necessary to meet the performance standard of protecting the unbelted adult male passenger. Houston and Richardson (2000) describe the strong reaction to these losses and a backlash against air bags, despite their benefits. The unintended consequences of air bags have led to technology developments and changes to standards and regulations. Between 1997 and 2000, NHTSA developed a number of interim solutions designed to reduce the risks of air bags, including on-off switches and deployment with less force (Ho, 2006). Simultaneously, safer air bags, called advanced air bags, were developed that deploy with a force tailored to the occupant by taking into account the seat position, belt usage, occupant weight, and other factors. In 2000, NHTSA mandated that the introduction of these advanced air bags begin in 2003 and that, by 2006, every new passenger vehicle would include these safety measures (NHTSA, 2000).",1350059531

And according to this (and most) style guides you don't capitalize prepositions.<p>But in this title, ""on"" is not being <i>used</i> as a preposition. It's part of a compound verb, ""catching on"". Verbs are capitalized, so both those words are capitalized. Another good clue here is that ""on"" is the last word in the title, so it's not likely to be a preposition (""pre-position"").<p>There is a subtlety here: ""catch on"" or ""catching on"" is often a compound verb meaning ""becoming popular"", but in a different context, it may be a simple verb and preposition. Consider these two headlines:<p>Sticky Notes are Catching On (becoming popular, ""catching on"" is a compound verb so both words capitalized)<p>Sticky Notes are Catching on Tables (getting stuck to tables, ""catching"" is a simple verb and ""on"" is a preposition, so ""on"" is not capitalized)",1350058473

It was a great offense to her if somebody came in so much as five minutes late.  Despite being the managing developer for the team, and hence, ultimately responsible for all the engineering work that happened, I refused to care, so long as the work was getting done.  I had a great team of talented guys that were always down to knock out a problem, whatever the problem was.<p>My boss wouldn't see the hours they put in working from home (""How do I know they're <i>working</i> if I can't see them!?!?""), or the hours they stayed late when the work wasn't done.<p>I tried the age old arguments ""So long as the work is getting done..."" or ""They can come and go whenever they want so long as I'm meeting deadlines..."" etc., but none of it flew.  I regret not trying harder to change the culture before ultimately giving up and going somewhere that 'got it'.  As a result, I have less responsibility, work from home, work more than I used to, and am happier to do so.  I also can't imagine giving up the team that I have now for any reason, and I honestly think they feel similarly.<p>I usually poo-poo all over 'company culture' lectures, but this one completely hits the nail on the head as far as I'm concerned.",1350058188

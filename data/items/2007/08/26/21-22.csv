Though to be fair pb does suggest this has changed.\n",1188165550
46806,comment,45773,45773,0,0,felipe,,,"I believe the key problem is that (most) students who enroll to a CS program expect to become engineers, but the CS curriculum is supposed to form scientists, not engineers. The key distinction is that in a SW Eng program the emphasis is on the process to build software (stuff like CMM, XP, quality processes, architecture methods, etc...).<p>Sure CS grads can make fantastic engineers, but my point here is that the difference between CS and SE is not well understood in the industry.",1188165288

Web 2.0 isn't about flashy web graphics it's about understanding how to bring users together in such a way that you create something new and exciting. Data-mining is the best way to generate actual businesses from 'Web 2.0' anything that helps people get their feet wet in this complex field is worth while.",1188164940

46803,comment,46789,46789,0,0,Readmore,,,"I personally think it's good that the authors recognize they need to bring in someone else to 'handle the hustle and bustle of starting a business.' However, from reading the article I get the impression that they don't want to put in the long hours and make the sacrifices that are required to be successful startup founders. If I were them I would take this article down before a potential investor reads it and realizes that they 'won't sacrifice their personal lives' to take care of their business.",1188164705

The <i>Woz</i> example is a a classic here.

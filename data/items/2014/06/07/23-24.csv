They look thick and serious, but if you actually read the claims, you will soon realize that it&#x27;s nothing but an obvious and straightforward procedure for deciding when and with whom to establish a VPN. None of these patents make sure that a VPN connection is more secure, more reliable, or in any way better.<p>Majority of the patent is explanation on how a VPN works, different mathematical explanations on how to generate random numbers, the theory behind secure communications. But none of that stuff is actually covered by the patent, so don&#x27;t be impressed by it. What is covered is basically the straightforward and logical application of the explained VPN concepts, but the VPN concepts them selves are not patented.<p>I am not sure if the patent examiner of this patent was dazzled by the 50+ pages of VPN theory and just granted this thing. To me it&#x27;s stunning! It&#x27;s like filing a patent that in intricate detail explains how an automobile works and than sneaking in a claim that you invented that an automobile can be used to move personal belonging from place to place.",1402185449

Had good results with specialized interlocked container-type classes (e.g. xlist(); a simplified list-type object) that parallel threads could use to persist simple scalar objects (string, int, bytes).<p>I think there&#x27;s definitely room for sharing techniques that exploit the fact that threads inherently share address space -- I don&#x27;t want to say that shared-nothing is the only paradigm supported and all communication must be done by message passing (like Rust?), because that&#x27;s not the best solution for all problems.<p>As for the main-thread/parallel-thread pause/run relationship... it won&#x27;t be as black and white as I allude to in the deck -- the main thread will still be running, albeit with a limited memory view (i.e. you&#x27;ll be restricted with what you can do in the main thread whilst parallel threads are running).<p>Ideally, the only time all the parallel threads get paused is when global state needs to be updated by the main thread.  Constantly pausing the parallel threads just because the main thread needs to do some periodic work won&#x27;t be ideal.<p>The application you&#x27;re referring to... is it something that exists, or are you just using hypothetical examples?  I&#x27;m always curious to hear of architectures where threads need to constantly talk to each other in order for work to get done -- does your app fit this bill?",1402185109

7863486,comment,7861874,7861874,0,0,brownbat,,,"Using and loving G+ and Hangouts to this day. I like how easy it is to get a group chat or a video chat going in the browser, and I like the increased control over sharing I have, especially relative to FB. (I can even share with people who don&#x27;t want to log in because they hate the service. My FB friends cannot.)<p>I&#x27;m trying to sift through the complaints to see if they&#x27;re relevant to me, but haven&#x27;t had much luck so far.<p>1. Everything<p>Complaints on the order of &quot;it broke everything&quot; just seem hyperbolic and silly.<p>2. Nymwars<p>I think they should allow pseudonyms, but I don&#x27;t blame the company for trying build something tied a little tighter to real world identities after fighting a decade long war against fraud and spam behind the scenes. I feel like it&#x27;s within their prerogative to say they&#x27;re building an identity service, because pseudonym based logins are already widely available. Faulting them for that choice is a bit like saying you don&#x27;t like Gmail because you think email is stupid.<p>3. YouTube<p>Among the other major complaints is that they broke YouTube comments, ie, the worst den of inane and offensive comments on the internet since 4chan. Good for them, the team deserves a medal.<p>Someone made a mashup just to illustrate the depravity of comments on the video site a few years ago:\n<a href=""http://comments.thatsaspicymeatball.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comments.thatsaspicymeatball.com/</a><p>4. Popularity<p>Probably the other tacit criticism is that Google launched a service that didn&#x27;t immediately trounce all other social media sites, delivering everything for everyone. It&#x27;s used by a <i>mere</i> 350 million people. It&#x27;s been criticized for that number being only a third of its registered base, but that seems perfectly on track or better than estimates for other social media sites. Twitter&#x27;s active userbase is probably roughly 20%, for example:<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-total-registered-users-v-monthly-active-users-2013-11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-total-registered-user...</a><p>It&#x27;s weird that a site with 350 million active monthly users is considered an embarrassing failure. I&#x27;m sure lots of services would be happy to trade userbases with G+.<p>It had a few cool features. It wasn&#x27;t world changing. I feel like it hit some of the Segwey effect, a victim of its hype more than of its failings.<p>5. Aesthetics.<p>I feel this is the most inarguable complaint. Some people don&#x27;t like the style of G+, don&#x27;t like its approach to usability, or find its sharing system needlessly complex or confusing. By all means, these individuals should not use the service. I don&#x27;t like the look and feel of Pinterest. I shouldn&#x27;t use Pinterest. To each her own. I worry some authors subtly shift this argument from &quot;I don&#x27;t like the feel of it,&quot; or even, &quot;My friends don&#x27;t like it,&quot; to &quot;It is a failure of design that no one should use.&quot; Seems a bit unfair.<p>I believe there are good usability guidelines, but I don&#x27;t subscribe to the belief that there is a perfect one size fits all, that all implementations of any service will eventually converge to one platonic form. Competition is good because we all like different things, each find different styles more intuitive.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to consider other arguments, but so far allegations of the service&#x27;s abject horribleness seem somewhat exaggerated.",1402184876

With a telescope, each station could see neighboring towers and relay their semaphore positions to the destination.<p>In a world where long-distance communication was via horse-carried letters, Chappe&#x27;s telegraph was a wonder. Signals from Paris were received in Lille, where the first stations were built (about 218 kilometers or 136 miles apart), after only a few minutes. The network soon spread to Brest, Toulon, Strasbourg, and later even across the English Channel.<p>Semaphore positions were defined in a codebook allowing a variety of messages to be sent. The well-crafted codebook provided easily recognizable semaphore patterns for common symbols, as well as error-correction codes that allowed a proper message to emerge despite errors in transmission or reception.<p>The Chappe network was in continuous use for more than 60 years. An electrical telegraph network supplanted it once the technology of long-distance insulated wires made that invention practical.<p>For our purposes, though, the most interesting aspect of the Chappe network came about in 1836 with the discovery that stock market information was being relayed across the network, buried in other messages, by means of what we now might call steganography. The semaphore operators were paid to introduce certain errors in the messages of various customers. Because of the error-correction codes the messages arrived intact, but if someone was privy to the raw symbols transmitted, the introduced errors contained a message that provided an advantage in buying or selling stocks.</i><p>TIL 1830s European stock traders were already into latency arbitrage using an early form of surreptitious DSL over optical telegraphs...",1402183718

Getting some kind of thread ID is thus only about one &quot;mov dest, [?S: some offset]&quot;, which is what both pthread_self() on linux and GetCurrentThreadId() on windows does (note that linux stores pointer to pthread_t in there, windows stores some opaque number that you have to convert to handle yourself if you need handle. The point is that in both cases the function does not do any kind of involved computation as would be the case if it had to traverse list of currently running threads).<p>This mechanism is essentially the only reason why amd64 in long mode still has limited support (complete enough to implement this, nothing much more) for segment registers.",1402182012

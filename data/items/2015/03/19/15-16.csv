A few key things that helped:<p>1) Good communication (as many others have mentioned) - team members were always on chat (campfire->slack) while working. We also had semi-regular weekly video chats where we talked about what was going on. Video was nice because it helped to put faces to the people you were working with.<p>2) Don&#x27;t focus on work 100% of the time - just like non-remote offices, people need time where they can chat about non-work related things, like games, home life, funny cat pictures, etc. Talking about these things helps create bonds beyond work, and improves the team imo.<p>3) Meet in person occasionally - the team all met once a year in person.

For example, you could setup to &quot;Post a Tweet&quot; challenge before downloading the product.

This has got less painful over the years, but at least with Linux you do one update and might have to do one reboot if there&#x27;s a kernel update, or restart some services or X if there&#x27;s something there that needs it, so yes, Linux definitely wins here (and I hear there may be rebootless kernel updates coming...)<p>It&#x27;s also odd that Windows 8.1, released much earlier than Ubuntu 14.04, didn&#x27;t have a NIC driver that worked with the OP&#x27;s device, when Ubuntu did. Obviously they put drivers through WHQL, but still, it&#x27;d be great if they could have a fast track for at least a very basic driver to get you connected.<p>I&#x27;d really like to see most devices which have some &#x27;common&#x27; functions be able to function with a minimal feature set without requiring a special driver. I believe displays have been able to do this for years with VESA mode, (some) webcams with UVC. If this could happen for NICs, it would make life so much easier.<p>Yes, Microsoft tools on a Microsoft system should be easy.

At that point, business stopped giving larger shares of the profits to employees and started loaning it to them. By that I mean businesses banked the profits, didn&#x27;t issue raises in the same way, and then the banks made credit cards available with the surplus deposits to people that, until then, didn&#x27;t have them.

As an employee, I love the flexibility of working for a remote team -- you&#x27;re more focused on getting the work done versus spending &#x27;x&#x27; hours a day in your office or in your cube.  On managing a remote team, it emphasized my need to ensure that everyone had a clear understanding of the tasks at hand for that day/week/month and that we were all communicating effectively (We used IRC, VoIP phones with a built in VPN (they could be on the &#x27;network&#x27; when plugged into the back of the phone), and google hangouts).<p>If you add in the fact that I&#x27;m basically in rural Appalachia (Eastern Kentucky) and there aren&#x27;t that many DevOps/Linux SysAdmin jobs for guys out here -- I&#x27;m almost forced to be a complete remote resource for most companies.  I&#x27;ve been doing a fair amount of interviewing recently -- I&#x27;ve had companies tell me that their engineering staff is completely remote but their DevOps team is an extension of corporate IT and that they need to be in the office for that (um, what?), that I&#x27;d be their first remote employee (scary), or that they have a cloud environment and they want a distributed team, but, everyone&#x27;s in an office somewhere because they don&#x27;t have enough internal support for a remote workforce.<p>From a manager&#x27;s perspective, letting go control of your team is scary:  you lose the ability to check in on your employees by walking to their desk, you lose the &#x27;butt in seat&#x27; visibility of your team, and you lose the &#x27;over the cubical&#x27; conversations.  What they don&#x27;t immediately see is that those same things still exist, and still happen, but in different mediums.  Employees will still chat amongst themselves in IRC, managers will still message people or note who is or isn&#x27;t here based on activity.  Giving up that control resulted in a productivity boost for my team -- almost everyone (there was one employee who had an interesting home situation and we had to get him office space to work) was twice as productive at home than they were in the office.  We still had our team dynamic -- we&#x27;d meet up once a week for dinner and work from a shared working space one afternoon a week -- but we felt closer to one another and understood our goals and targets more.",1426778942

There are also other solutions, using distributed storage engines running on commodity HW.

Fair enough, it&#x27;s totally aligned with their strategy.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying you don&#x27;t need any external drivers in Linux (looking at you, NVidia), but in my experience (same for many people, including the guy from the post) you can get to work with a bare ISO.

Companies such as Uber incentivize unlicensed and uninsured motorists to drive by making it profitable with seemingly far less control than existing businesses, hence the panic reaction and public debate on the matter.<p>Paris is relatively small but very dense, and can be maze-like. You can live in Paris and be completely lost a few hundred meters away from your place. Streets and directions are hard to follow and remember, and distances are skewed by traffic, one-way-streets, pedestrian zones, bus lanes and cycle lanes. Some streets open and close depending on the hour of the day/night or the season. It can seriously be a mess and you simply can&#x27;t assume you&#x27;re going to be a decent professional Parisian driver just because you live in Paris.<p>Lastly we all have a proper ID, so it&#x27;s absolutely viable not to have a driver&#x27;s license at all (provided you don&#x27;t drive). Driving itself in Paris is generally a time-sink and a money sink. You only drive when you don&#x27;t have a choice. For me, that&#x27;s only when I&#x27;m on holiday away from the city.<p>Insurance is another matter, and yes it&#x27;s illegal to drive an uninsured vehicle, and you also need a special license to drive for profit.",1426778499

I was surprised there was resistance in asking because my team is spread out globally so in theory we are all remote workers. When I did become remote, it was more like a trial/probation to see if it works out.<p>- If so, when did you let them know? Months in advance? Weeks in advance?\nI started the process in Fall and told them I would be moving in Summer. My manager&#x27;s manager dragged their feet on making a decision until I told my team I would be putting in my 2 weeks notice in Summer. My coworkers sent emails to their managers that it would be a huge loss for the team if I had to quit. I didn&#x27;t plan on using this as leverage but it worked out.<p>- How did you enjoy working remotely in a new location?\nI am a very social person, but I love working remotely as I get more done than in an office. The local office was an open office design so noise would force me to put headphones on. Now I can play music out loud and not be distracted by side conversations.<p>You need to define a space that is your office and have rules with your family, e.g. if the door is shut do not disturb me. You need set working hours too. I rarely have to sign in at night to assist with global team members.<p>- How often did they need you to commute to the office and for how long was your visit?\nI usually visit the office twice a year or more if I am in town visiting old friends.

I have a different interest from most people in this stuff, but I like to create stuff that balances range of expression with ease of expression. The key is enabling expression, not just giving a place to passively consume. Good examples include iMovie, and Vine; Instagram and VSCOcam; etc. etc. Basically, it can&#x27;t just be a one-note app: it has to give you the possibility of discourse, of dialectic. That&#x27;s what I really like in Vine, actually: this feels like a different app than 6 months ago, because the people on it are growing and changing as artists, and the app allows that. But it limits them to 6 seconds. So yeah, find the balance.<p>That&#x27;s just the product side of things though.

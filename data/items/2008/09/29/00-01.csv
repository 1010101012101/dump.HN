So I was very curious about that, as I studied fields and all that a long while ago and that sounded like a rare concept.",1222649289

317953,comment,317855,317931,0,0,abstractbill,,,"I think DanielBMarkham is being rather loose with terminology here (or perhaps talking about something other than the Riemann sphere, but it <i>sounds</i> like that's what he's talking about).<p>The problem isn't that you ""can't define integers"" when you introduce an infinity.  The problem is (as the article I linked to says) the resulting system does not form a field (i.e. the usual arithmetic operations don't behave like you would expect anymore).  Follow the link to fields if you want to know more.",1222649071

I used to think location-based social networking would be a huge hit on the iPhone, but I've since changed my mind.<p>I go to a private college with mostly trendy, wealthy kids. Almost everyone has an iPhone. I have about 30 friends with iPhones. Absolutely none of them use any social networking app other than Facebook.<p>I think Facebook should acquire Loopt and integrate it into their own app.",1222648796

What does it buy you?<p>At the very least, one would expect that 5/0 = infinity implies that 5 = 0 * infinity, but that is not the case. And if you insist that it is, does 4/0 = infinity then imply that 4 = 0 * infinity, and hence 4 = 5?",1222648243

317945,comment,317155,317907,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I found your argument lacking. I wouldn't say I disagree, but I'm still of the opinion that n=2 couples is seriously old-fashioned the same way opposite-sex marriages are. If people love one another and want a permanent union, we should allow them to. To argue that we should open this up to same-sex and still leave it at 2 is to have a strange mix of progressiveness and conservatism.<p>1) People don't want to pay for it. Well, last I checked we weren't adding up figures. This is a definition change. The economics of it are free to work in various ways. For instance, companies could offer n-couple insurance with scaling rates.<p>2) Who makes executive decisions? ie, Who Pulls The Plug. I'd think you'd set this up the same way any n-party organization, like a board of directors, would. You could just vote. Or go by age. Or by gender. Seems like your marriage contract would be the place to put this.<p>We allow lots of people to form agreements with n-people. We allow people to live with whomever they choose. Why not allow these agreements to have the force of marriage? I can form a multi-billion-dollar business deal with 7 women but we can't all call each other spouses? It's just stupid. And it's cruel. Especially to me.  :)",1222647969

But the point that I am making is that they are also subject to market 'whims.' In fact they constitute their own sort of a sub-market with it's own whims (as is the VC market, IPO market, etc).<p>A year or two of bad news & bad predictions could sour it. Employees & founders might start to favour corporate jobs.<p>Not saying it has to be drastic. VCs pulling purse strings a little tighter. Founders ready to bail a little earlier. Employees a little less willing to take stock. Angels preferring to take a year or two off. Most 'startups' would be affected by at least some of these.",1222647728

317938,comment,317549,317799,0,0,newt0311,,,"Actually this offers an interesting case study. Lets look at the results of this crisis.<p>Three major financial institutions (Lehman, Bear Stearns, and Merryl Lynch) had their shareholders loose most of their assets and are no longer operational or independent. The remaining two investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs abandoned this business models and are now on their way to become bank holding companies.<p>In all cases, shareholders have seen massive (>50%) declines in the value of their shares due to excessive risk taking.<p>Do you seriously think that any institution except for Hedge Funds will ever leverage themselves 30:1 based on shaky opaque assets in the near future (I say near because every ~10 years, wall street goes haywire).<p>Furthermore, you are happy bashing wall street but have you ever taken a look at the balance sheet of the US government?<p>Look at your own last paragraph:<p>""lot of these banks are left with hot potatoes in their hand, and brought us to this mess.""<p>Capitalism at work. These banks took foolish bets and now they are paying for it. The biggest blot in this picture is the $700 billion bailout which is sponsored by ... the US government.",1222647125

The success of ycombinator is mainly based on the success of its startup selection.<p>You need someone like Paul Graham to attract a lot of startups.  You then need to be good at filtering out and select only the startups that show promise.  And you then need to help these startups with huge demo days.<p>Who else has managed to crack this?  No one.  If you see the Indian and other ycombinator copy cats, you will still see such a high degree of crappy startup acceptance rate.  Fix that, and you will have a successful ycombinator copy cat.<p>Because the market is global.",1307772960

Certain aspects of traditional cultures (e.g. long meal times and afternoon nap times) may simply be incompatible with increased productivity.

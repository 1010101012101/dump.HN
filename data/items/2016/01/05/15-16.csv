10843876,comment,10843680,10843680,0,0,RogerL,,,"I prefer to think of it in terms of the statistical inversion problem. That is, we have an event(s) that occur, which we may imperfectly understand. We take noisy measurements of that event. Clearly, the causal relationship is the events cause the measurements - a bad measurement does not cause the event to move.<p>But, in practice all we have are measurements, and from that we want to find an optimal (or good) estimate for what the events were. Hence, inversion.<p>Bayes formula expresses P(x|y) in terms of P(Y|x), so you can perform the inversion using bayes.<p>In many fields establishing the prior is difficult, hence frequentist methods are popular.<p>There are many techniques for the statistical inversion problem. Trying to track a ballistic object in a vacuum? Fit the measurements to a second order polynomial (parabola) and you are done (well, you have to decide least squares vs robust methods, but it is not such a hard problem in the scheme of things). Trying to track a manuevering jet, stock prices, or disease incidence rates. Now your model of the problem is much less clear.<p>We model lack of information as random variables. It isn&#x27;t &quot;random&quot; in the deterministic sense, just in the sense that we don&#x27;t know. Establish a good probabilistic description of that lack of knowledge in your prior, and you are probably going to get good result: this jet fighter is probabilisticly either moving straight, performing a coordinated turn, or performing an uncoordinated turn. Use a Markov chain to model those likelihoods (e.g.), and you may end up with good results. But if your modeling of the prior is poor, well, good luck to you, your output is probably nonsense.",1452009544

Not my favorite things to debug...<p>Here&#x27;s what I usually do in such cases:<p>Call stack is unreliable at that point. You&#x27;ll see puzzling things like function calls with impossible parameters, etc. If things just don&#x27;t make any sense, it&#x27;s better to map all code paths that can lead to the crashing EIP/RIP (hopefully valid pointer to the instruction that caused the crash). Check EIP/RIP if it&#x27;s in some rep movsd (= potentially inlined memcpy, check ECX (RCX) rep counter, EDI (RDI) rep pointer), or if the execution is in some runtime library code such as memset, memcpy, etc. similar. The next thing is to make sense of the call stack manually, if there are portions not overwritten, but what stack walk couldn&#x27;t resolve. Of course it pays to take a look around stack otherwise as well, for signs of overwrite and contents of the overwrite.<p>It&#x27;s also possible a pointer to stack object leaked at some point and the crash occurs at completely different part of code than where it actually segfaulted. Or some runtime structure was corrupted, like heap. Sometimes you can find those by just inspecting and guessing struct/object shape and values near stack pointer ESP (RSP).<p>If the bug can be reproduced, memory breakpoints, logging (especially if multithreaded, but watch out for blocking I/O from logging), tools for debugging memory corruption (valgrind, compiler paranoid mode, etc.) etc, even mapping some pages unreadable and unwritable. It can take a while to find the actual bug.<p>If reproduction is not possible, good luck. Better spend some quality time with memory hex view, disassembler, trying to locate registers and stack values that might contain pointers, etc. It might take a while to find the issue...",1452009464

A DAF is a charitable entity that is sort of like a bank account: you put your money in, get the tax receipt, your money manager invests the capital, and you can allocate some portion of the money (the amount depends on the financial institution&#x27;s policies) to actual 501c3&#x27;s (I.e charities doing charitable work).<p>DAFs are just another instrument offered by the Fildelities of the world to increase assets under management.<p>The most common reason people give to DAFs is so they can get a tax receipt for the current year and defer the decision about which charities to support until later.<p>Plus giving stock to charity is the most tax-efficient way to give.

10843789,comment,10841761,10841761,0,0,cryoshon,,,"Most conversations about working fewer hours are really conversations about how much the personal resources of workers can be drawn upon without providing extra pay before there are negative productivity consequences. This article ties in directly with some ideas I&#x27;ve been exploring recently [0] involving personal resources of workers and time/productivity management of workers [1][2]. The concepts of worker personal resource management and worker time management are largely foreign to the places I&#x27;ve worked, much to their detriment. Instead, the strategy could be described as &quot;colloquial management&quot;, a mishmash of half-remembered concepts from business school or worse, the playground.<p>If a worker can quantify roughly how much time and energy each task at work will take up, a clearer picture of how to be the most productive in the least amount of time will reveal itself. Employers perpetually hide in the ambiguity of the employees&#x27; time and effort, hoping to make a profit out of asking for too much and motivate their workforce by periodically throwing a tiny bone to the most masochistic over-achiever. A tabulated rubric describing to the employer exactly how much time is spent on each task and how much mental and physical energy the task takes relative to the worker&#x27;s actual capacity for these energies would show exactly how wasteful it is to over-work people.<p>Longer hours deplete worker mental energy and physical energy resources whether or not there is more work being done. Once these resources are depleted, worker efficiency drops precipitously. Additionally, periodically depleting these resources leads to worker burnout. I also suspect that workers resent longer hours whether or not they are necessary, leading to weakened ability to refill their mental energy reservoir due to poorer mental health in general.<p>[0]:<a href=""http://cryoshon.co/2016/01/04/how-to-survive-late-capitalism-as-a-worker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryoshon.co/2016/01/04/how-to-survive-late-capitalism...</a><p>[1]:<a href=""http://cryoshon.co/2015/12/23/time-management-tips-hot-from-the-hiv-research-lab/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryoshon.co/2015/12/23/time-management-tips-hot-from-...</a><p>[2]:<a href=""http://cryoshon.co/2016/01/01/how-to-decide-what-to-prioritize-at-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryoshon.co/2016/01/01/how-to-decide-what-to-prioriti...</a>",1452008717

10843735,comment,10834906,10839275,0,0,johnjamesjacoby,,,"Hey CK! Long time, no see! And thanks for all of your contributions to the original bbPress ecosystem.<p>There&#x27;s always going to be a special place in my heart for bbPress 1.x, and BackPress. These two projects were the most optimized, as far as all of the sister-projects go, and still to this day power large swaths of WordPress.org.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to place all of the blame on Matt, though I understand how and why that&#x27;s easy to do, especially when your opinion has not been the popular vote either time.<p>The choice to move bbPress to BackPress was, I think, an obvious one in 2007/8. BackPress <i>was</i> the future, and until WordPress became hugely successful and backwards compatibility became paramount, WordPress was on course to get the same heart transplant. It wasn&#x27;t until it became clearly obvious that breakage would occur and most everyone agreed that the BackPress dependency exponentially increased the barrier to entry that the shift away from BackPress happened, and bbPress lost its legs again.<p>Consider, though, that bbPress is WordPress&#x27;s moon in this scenario. It took the BackPress bullet so that WordPress didn&#x27;t have to, and for that I think bbPress (and Sam Bauers&#x27; work at the time) is hugely responsible for the current success of the WordPress platform, even if it isn&#x27;t ever championed as such. bbPress showed everyone first hand how much work it was just to get back to square one again. Why bother doing the same to WordPress?<p>In 2010, it was very clear that WordPress is the hub of our ecosystem, and everything else is a spoke. The decision to move bbPress to be a WordPress plugin, at that time, is another obvious one. The overlapping systems (I.E. BackPress) are abandonware, and there&#x27;s no sense in trying to Frankenstein everything together anymore. Rather, the decision was to rebuild bbPress with everything we had learned since 2005, to take advantage of everything new that WordPress got and BackPress did not.<p>* Is bbPress the plugin bloated?\nI don&#x27;t think any more-so than a stand-alone version would be if it were trying to keep up with WordPress&#x27;s current functionalities, or other forum software.<p>* Is bbPress the plugin confusing to users looking for forums?\nI don&#x27;t think so, since the problem it&#x27;s solving now is specifically &quot;forums for WordPress&quot; rather than &quot;forums so fast you&#x27;ll freak.&quot;<p>* Could bbPress be something great had BackPress or pluginizing it never occurred?\nNo, to be quite blunt. If demand were there or if it was really as awesome as we remember it, anyone could have forked old bbPress to resurrect it, but it didn&#x27;t (and likely will never) happen, because porting WordPress&#x27;s improvements would take a lifetime.<p>* What&#x27;s my personal stance on bbPress?\nI loved 0.9. I love 1.2. I love 2.x. They&#x27;re all great, and fun to work on, and rewarding, and incredibly satisfying to tinker with. I will always enjoy the thought of a BackPress powered internet vs. a WordPress one, but that&#x27;s not where we are today. 10 years from now, when a RESTful WordPress has sites talking back & forth to each other, it may be possible to do the BackPress heart transplant we couldn&#x27;t do 10 years prior, but that&#x27;s highly unlikely.<p>Automattic has a funny way of taking the long way around and having it work out. In many ways, the current incarnation of WordPress.com is very much what BuddyPress was in 2008. Central activity stream, Notifications, Settings, Followers, etc... It&#x27;s no surprise, then, that a company lead by Matt and projects lead by Matt should operate similarly. The long-long-games for WordPress, bbPress, BuddyPress, and Automattic separately as a company (and Jetpack), are incredibly optimistic and collectively are gunning to be an operating system for the World Wide Web; the connective tissue that keeps people communicating and congregating, and if bbPress needed to take a few hits along the way to make all of that possible, I&#x27;m okay with that, because I think it still has a bright future ahead of it, and will continue to be the forum software of choice for people already using WordPress.<p>I know it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;ll ever sway you to put as much passion into bbPress 2.x as you did 0.x, but I&#x27;d personally love it if you did. You had dozens of plugins and had contributed hugely in the beginning, and whether or not you feel it, I for one consider your early commitment and enjoyment of the bbPress platform to be incredibly inspiring.",1452008189

I enjoyed it so much I bought one for me (UX/front end dev) and am Craigslist-ing our Wacom Cintiq and Intuos. The Cintiq lag is awful, while the disassociation between screen and tablet of the Intuos was always “best of a bad solution”. Personally, I always found the “give” in Wacom’s styli to accommodate pressure sensitivity too much for my liking, but my medium of preference was always lead holders; I suspect those who prefer painting, pastel or other softer medium might have the opposite opinion.<p>It’s not perfect, there’s still some lag in different apps. Wacom also had a slightly better “tooth” on the drawing surface. The omission of an “eraser” can be annoying, though I would imagine less so for artists who wouldn’t use the eraser on a drawing implement anyway. The various buttons on both the Wacom tablet and the pen were also really helpful, though a bit overwhelming. Wacom also has a variety of nibs for different feeling brushes. My TL;DR the Wacom is a more productive and perhaps more capable tool, but the iPad Pro + Pencil combination is the closest any technology has come to replicating paper & pencil.<p>When you compare the costs $799 for the cheapest 13&quot; Wacom Cintiq vs $898 for the iPad Pro + Pencil it’s going to be a no-brainer for a lot of artists who aren’t deeply entrenched in a Wacom workflow.",1452007976

Coming back to work I figured I shall be going with working full hours for three months and then taking a month off again. So that comes to three months of spare time and nine months of work annually.<p>The realisation was about working patterns.

This has always been so, even as a kid. I could work on something really intensively for a few days and then I needed to do something completely different. The newest realization was that it works on longer timescale too. I can work three months and do my absolute best, and then relax and have time for my own things.<p>This sort of a contract――relax pattern is quite reminiscent to life and nature itself. I feel much at home between the pushes and pulls.

Software is a resource, just like the buildings those companies occupy and the people they employ. It helps them meet a business objective. They do not care what developers think makes them most productive. They care what will minimize IT training and support costs and what will be around in ten years. That is why companies that make their livings off of enterprise sales design their software for C-level execs and IT decision-makers, not low-level developers. It&#x27;s also why most in-house enterprise software is written in Java and not Ruby.<p>So the point is that, just like for Apple with the 2012 MBP, there is money to be made from those who are risk-averse and see more cost in moving to a new platform than from sticking with what already works.

This is a major milestone on the path to putting great VR in the hands of millions.<p>You’re going to experience thrilling adventures in Lucky’s Tale and Edge of Nowhere, feel your heart race as you scale mountains in The Climb, and become a rockstar in Rockband VR. You’ll create and share something magical in Oculus Medium and participate in the ultimate space dogfighting in EVE: Valkyrie. As one of the early supporters of Oculus, you helped make this revolution happen. And before we open Rift pre-orders to the world, we wanted to share one more special update with you, our Kickstarter community.<p>As a small token of our appreciation for your support, all Kickstarter backers who pledged for a Rift development kit will get a free Kickstarter Edition Oculus Rift! And like all Rift pre-order purchasers, you’ll receive a bundled copy of Lucky’s Tale and EVE: Valkyrie.<p>...<p>You were there at the beginning of our journey -- we couldn’t have done it without you. Today marks a new chapter.<p>Thank you!\n-- Palmer, Brendan, Nate, Michael",1452007096

Sharepoint is used by all manner of organization for all manner of tasks. I just recently ran into an organization using it as a CMS platform. Past teams I&#x27;ve been on have used it as a document sharing platform, but even that experience is far from ideal. Sharepoint is used because enterprises are not in the risk business when it comes to software procurement. But for document review and sharing there are a host of better options available. Very few small teams that I&#x27;ve worked on that had their own control over what software they used chose to use Sharepoint of their own volition. Take that as you will.",1452006542

It&#x27;s not like shipping takes that long these days or that waiting a few days would make you not want to watch it. I agree that DRM is bad. While a nice screen helps, it&#x27;s not required, but you will get a much better experience from a Bluray restoration.<p>As for our friend YIFY, do you wonder what kind of &quot;magic&quot; they do to fit feature-length films into 700MB? Most importantly they completely starve the bitrate so nothing looks as good as it could. Then they use a whole variety of filters to change the film from how it originally looked so it will compress better like denoising or color changes. Not to mention other atrocities such as changing the aspect ratio, downscaling, low bitrate audio, or even cutting out parts like intros and credits. You&#x27;re only impressed with it because you haven&#x27;t seen what you&#x27;re missing.<p>And thanks for the personal attack, In the future I&#x27;ll make sure not to write well-meaning comments to someone who had trouble with a specific method of watching something.

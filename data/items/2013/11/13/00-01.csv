A cheetah is &quot;fast&quot;, but it&#x27;s not fast if I&#x27;m trying to use them to propel fighter jets. If I say, &quot;my code is fast&quot;, am I saying it&#x27;s fast enough for the problem at hand? Faster than it was before? Fast compared to most other code that solves the same problem?<p>&quot;Efficient&quot; has all of the same problems and it&#x27;s also ambiguous. If my library is efficient, does that mean it runs fast? Starts up fast? Uses memory efficiently? Bandwidth?<p>&quot;Performant&quot; is etymologically strange, but in the place I&#x27;ve seen it used, it has an effective, precise meaning: &quot;well-performing in speed relative to the needs of the problem&quot;. It means &quot;fast enough&quot; without the negative connotations of &quot;enough&quot;, sort of like &quot;plenty fast&quot;. Likewise, it&#x27;s negation is usefully precise, &quot;not performant&quot; means &quot;however fast it is, that isn&#x27;t enough for our needs&quot;.",1384304391

The files are text, so you can merge them, but anything more than just minor changes will not work properly and someone will have to redo their work.<p>Working on code is fine and your normal guidelines apply to simultaneous work.<p>I have Unity projects with 3-5 teammates and we don&#x27;t run into too many problems with scene/prefab merges. Normally each person is working on separate stuff so it would be rare for 2 people to need to touch the same prefab or scene.<p>If your scenes or prefabs are huge and it becomes a problem then you probably should think about redoing your architecture to keep your scenes and prefabs smaller.",1384304378

Compared to the U.S., a &quot;modern&quot; space in the U.K. seems to me a little more ordered, neat, well-packaged, brightly lit, and perhaps a little more sterile than its counterpart in the U.S.<p>Of course, most spaces in the U.K. are not like this. But that may be why such &quot;modern&quot; spaces exist: if your town has an 800 year-old castle, and your pub is 150 years old and filled with well-worn, comfy furniture, having other more brightly-lit, ordered spaces is probably an interesting contrast.<p>My impression of the U.S. is that &quot;modern&quot; spaces are a little more warm, and less concerned with presenting an ordered and tidy facade.  For example, it&#x27;s easier to find &quot;modern&quot; spaces with exposed ceiling pipes, building supports, etc, in the U.S., whereas those seemed almost always hidden away in British spaces.<p>But at the same time, you don&#x27;t have nearly the same amount of contrast between spaces.  So it&#x27;s hard for me to find a &quot;pub&quot; in the U.S. that has the same warmth and comfy feel as a U.K. pub.",1384304194

6722610,comment,6719487,6722033,2,0,Perseids,,,"Maybe I&#x27;m phrasing what you meant with your third sentence, but one reason the banks would have losses is that 2ct per dollar is only the average and those that could actually pay those 2ct are worth more then those 2ct.<p>Simple example: 100 people overall, each having a 100000 dollar debt; 20 of them will not be able to pay back anything, 20 are able to pay back 1 ct per dollar, 20 are able to pay back 2 ct per dollar, 40 are able to pay back 3.5 ct per dollar. Those 40 on top will now, too, only pay back 2 ct per dollar and the bank loses 1.5 ct per dollar on them, resulting in 100000 * 40 * 1.5ct = 60000 dollar losses.<p>Personally I&#x27;d like that solution anyway, because it would help to even out the unfair distribution of wealth.",1384304126

6722535,comment,6716112,6722218,1,0,lmkg,,,"I&#x27;ve thought about how to quantify the effects of skill on a game. A first-order estimate would quantify luck as the inverse of skill.<p>In a completely symmetric multiplayer game, Player A is measurably more skilled than Player B if, over a large number of games, Player A&#x27;s win rate is higher than 50% by a statistically significant margin. This definition can be extended to both single-player games, and to non-symmetric multiplayer games, by saying that after Player A and Player B have played the same scenario a large number of times, that Player A&#x27;s win rate is higher than Player B&#x27;s by a statistically significant margin. The &quot;same scenario&quot; meaning identical starting conditions for single-player, or the same opponents for multi-player. This can be extended again by saying &quot;the same scenario&quot; means drawing starting conditions or opponents from the same random distribution (by relying on the nature of statistical significance).<p>So that&#x27;s how you would define pairwise player skill. From this, there are several ways to determine total rankings for a population of players, using Elo or linear algebra techniques. I&#x27;m eliding details here because this is the step where they matter the least.<p>Finally, in order to determine the impact of Luck vs Skill: Take two players at different skill levels. Say, Player X is at the median skill level, and Player Y is two standard deviations above that (top 5%). What is Player Y&#x27;s win rate over Player X? The closer to 100%, the more skill-based the game is. The closer to 50%, the more luck-based the game is.<p>Note that in general this will depend heavily on which two skill levels you pick to compare. For example, Player X is median, Player Y is top 5%, Player Z is top 1%. Players Y & Z could have a 100% win rate over Player X, but Player Z only has a 51% win rate over Player Y. This game would probably be described as heavily skill-based, but with a low skill ceiling.",1384303120

Here is a simple version of the education background of the author: He pursued a PhD from TsingHua university in China, but failed (Or he chose to quit.) Then he got an offer from Cornell and then quit within one (or two?) years. After that, he tried to pursue a PhD from Indiana University in programming language area but failed again. Now he got a master degree and got a job. In many ways, he is really not a researcher in programming language field.<p>I don&#x27;t want to judge someone from his/her education background. But keeping saying &quot;I&#x27;m a PhD, my research is about programming language and my advisor is some guy who you should believe&quot; really doesn&#x27;t help his argument.

If he just want to say that FP and OO both have their cons and pros, then I totally agree and I really think it doesn&#x27;t need such an article to say this simple fact.

Your photos, data etc should be safe as long as there aren&#x27;t further exploits (which of course exist).<p>Furthermore, i have yet to hear of a slave high level operating system to the baseband. iOS or android being initialised and commanded by a secondary baseband OS would just be a bizarre setup. That of course does not mean that the baseband doesn&#x27;t pass commands to the high level OS.

The problem is that I need it to go even faster (currently takes a few seconds) but this function is already heavily optimized and uses Intel MKL to accelerate the math.  In fact, my cython implementation would be slower than numpy.dot were it not for some embedded logic that breaks out of the dot product half way through calculation. As I&#x27;m computing the row * row, going element by element, if the running sum of those products gets to be really negative (indicating that in the dimensions multiplied so far, the two rows are highly dissimilar) I stop tryin to calculate the rest of the row, thereby saving me from calculating the full dot product. This is cheating obvioisly, but it&#x27;s x3 or x4 faster numpy.dot.

537086,comment,536639,536639,0,0,Oompa,,,"I was about to go to UT Austin, but after this story, I'm glad I came to Georgia Tech instead. The lab computers are pretty good, and the ones in the College of Computing are just thin clients that VNC you into Red Hat or Windows, which you can VNC into from your own laptop. On top of that, the Wifi network is fantastic.",1238299181

I had no idea back then we were 10 years ahead of the curve, and no idea that this sort of thing would reach global proportions and even start to be picked up and shown on TV.",1238299126

The cover letter would actually show me that the person made some modicum of effort to apply to my company; the LaTeX wouldn't give me anything I wouldn't be able to tell from the rest of the applicant's resume. And there's no way it's worth more than ""started own company"".",1238299023
537083,comment,537018,537018,0,0,jballanc,,,"Is it just me, or does everyone else get the feeling that there are two Twitter communities out there? Personally, I follow friends, one or two announcement streams, and an influential figure or two in the Ruby community. Essentially, I use it as a quick tool to keep up to date on what's important to me.<p>Then it seems like there's everyone else who just discovered Twitter in the past month or two. These people seem to be either one of ""I can follow my favorite celebrity! It's like I'm almost touching them..."" or ""I'm going to be huge and have lots of followers and feel important for it..."" For them, Twitter is just the latest fad like Facebook, MySpace, Geocities, etc. before it.<p>I guess, even though I've been on Twitter for a while now, I still don't <i>get it</i>. Maybe I'm elitist? Maybe I'm becoming out of touch?",1238298977

Unlike the common ""10 things you must do"" stories on HN, there aren't really any well-defined rules for this.

Last time I tried to use the Solaris machine it didn't have ls installed on it.<p>I totally agree with you about the Linux setup. The first time I start fvwm2 I was like wtf is this. That actually encouraged me to figure out what a window manager was and how to start a different one.<p>You are wrong about the overnight jobs (at least when I was there), you can only run them on certain servers that are designated for overnight jobs. For most cases you did not have to get permission.<p>UT has enough money and computers that each student should be given their own vm.",1238298590
537073,comment,537018,537060,0,0,froo,,,"As someone who spearheaded something stupid last year I'd like to share some metrics on just how far stupid can get out of hand.<p>First, screenshot from Google Analytics of the period<p><a href=""http://files.marklancaster.org/images/bestactever_traffic_oct1-nov11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.marklancaster.org/images/bestactever_traffic_oc...</a><p>That was from time the domain was registered (I actually reg'd it on oct 3) to the time I stopped caring about it. I sold it sometime later to recoup the server costs (and got a little cash on the side). It was hosted on mediatemple, and version 1 of the site used way too much of their alloted monthly GPU usage. Here's another graph of the first day which I screenshotted at the time.<p><a href=""http://files.marklancaster.org/images/gpu.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.marklancaster.org/images/gpu.jpg</a><p>I ended up using about 2x the monthly GPU usage over the first 18 hour period before I took it down and the site iterated from a PHP version of the voting script to a JS version to try and distribute the processing power a little bit. If I recall correctly there were about 34 major iterations over that month period and countless minor ones just to keep several steps ahead of MTV.<p>MTV's traffic to their UK site went through the roof at the time<p><a href=""http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/mtv.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/mtv.co.uk</a><p>This can be confirmed as I actually had someone inside MTV (who reached out to me first) sending me statistics of what was happening internally on their servers. Here is one of the screenshots (of many) I was sent from within MTV about the actual stats from their servers.<p><a href=""http://files.marklancaster.org/images/ema.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.marklancaster.org/images/ema.png</a><p>You'll notice there is a point where there was no traffic, that was a few hours in which they took down the voting backend to make some changes to handle traffic. They actually took down the systems several times over the month (at one point a whole weekend to add another server - which was misconfigured and we ended up telling MTV about it so they could fix it... heh, misconfigured Apache)<p>It got to the point where MTV wanted to interview me about what was happening.<p><a href=""http://files.marklancaster.org/images/didwewinyet.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.marklancaster.org/images/didwewinyet.jpg</a><p>And being interviewed by Wired was the high point of the whole thing for me.<p><a href=""http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/rick-astleys-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/rick-astleys-on.html</a><p>But basically, the moral of the story is that the ""smart people"" on the web are vastly outnumbered. I think we often tend to forget that we're in the minority.<p>If the mantra is <i>""make something people want""</i>, then one of the answers is <i>""make something stupid""</i><p>EDIT - lots of edits to clarify and add metrics/screenshots.<p>There were many screenshots taken over that period as I catalogued everything I could when I had originally stated my intentions here on HN.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=323248"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=323248</a>",1238298522

My feeling is that there are a lot of Chinese people who speak acceptable English.<p>However, in a major metropolitan area like Nagoya, you could fit all programmers who are functionally bilingual in a room the size of my kitchen.  (It might have actually happened once.  Three in one place, crikey.)<p>There is a certain benefit to having one token white guy around who speaks Japanese, too, but I've got higher ambitions in life than being the token white guy.  Besides, every organization only needs one token white guy, but e.g. my employers would hire twelve clones of me for bilingualism if they could.<p>[Edit: which reminds me.  Here's my algorithm for ranking language choices for anyone looking for career prospects: sum(trade between your country and of all countries speaking that language) / sum(number of Americans who speak the language better than you + number of relevant foreigners who speak English better than you speak their language).<p>The languages that consistently top this heuristic are Korean, Japanese, and maybe Chinese.  If you're looking for employment in government, Arabic and possibly Russian are good bets, too.  I'd stay away from Spanish for career purposes.  I love being able to speak it, don't get me wrong, but you're asking to compete with literally millions of natively bilingual American Hispanics and competing with millions is not the point of the exercise.",1238296644

537052,comment,536718,537011,0,0,c00p3r,,,"About psychology behind programming - there are very interesting parallels - almost everything in psychotherapy is based on the usage of the language and direct communication. This means to choosing a words carefully, paying full attention to the order of the words in a sentence, simplicity an unambiguous of the sentences and adapting to and reusing the client's vocabulary.<p>The same ideas should be applied to any texts (source code, documentation, marketing) that we're creating, because these texts, and especially the source code, are being written not for the compilers or interpreters, but for the people, same like you.<p>It seems like XP, Refactoring and other good ideas which are based on readability and simplicity of the source code is just the reflections of the thousand years old ideas. The old sages, sutras, and stories were survived because they are easy to understand, remember and modify when necessary.<p>There are some hints - not psychology but worth to notice: Ruby as a programming language which was developed by Japanese (East, Symbolic) mind, the 37signals which is trying to adapt Zen principles in project management, and a brilliant philosophy behind Python - simplicity but imperfection.",1238296004

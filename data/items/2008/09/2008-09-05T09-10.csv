Not much of a surprise that it's not ""ready for enterprise"".<p>There's little chance of ""Enterprise"" even evaluating it before 6 months have passed anyway. Then they'll take a year to come to a conclusion. If they even bother to do it at all.<p>The whole question is irrelevant anyway, since the aim of Chrome is not to distribute Chrome itself, but to get everyone to adopt the technologies inside Chrome. As they say themselves, ""success"" will be when even IE adopts Chrome technologies.",1220608764

I'm not a religious person but I don't think that that is really important. It seemed to be more of a summer break thing with the added bonus of possible redemption. I suppose you could even take a car and just follow the route. Actually this might be a bit sacrilegious.",1220608380

295725,comment,295674,295674,0,0,felipe,,,"> Basically, the impression I'm getting is that most carriers do not want 'small fish' like us to send MMS messages on their network without approval.<p>EXACTLY!<p>The way we circumvented the system a few years ago (2006) was to get a plain unlimited SMS plan, and then programatically send and receive SMSs through a real phone connected to the server via USB (not sure about MMS, but it is probably similar). This is very slow (12 seconds per message), and most carriers tell you ""unlimited"" but there is an actual limit in the fine-print.<p>I would recommend this solution only so you can bootstrap it. If you really take off, the carrier will block you immediately, so a business model that can sustain the MMS costs is a must (as swombat pointed out).<p>Feel free to email me if you need more info on this SMS hack.",1220608262

Right from the beginning:<p>""Imagine what would happen if GM and Ford collaborated to invest in the components and architecture of a better public transport network -- and then licensed it for free to cities, states, and countries.""<p>What?  This is a completely bogus analogy with Google's browser strategy.  A better public transport network in no way benefits GM/Ford to anywhere near the same extent that a better browser benefits Google.  In fact it would quite possibly be detrimental to their business.",1220606802

4293670,comment,4292598,4292598,8,0,twelvechairs,,,"> Its surprising now to think what might have happened had Blizzard not controlled the intellectual property rights for the Warcraft universe  its highly unlikely Blizzard would be such a dominant player in the game industry today.<p>This seems a very important observation. Its interesting how most of the major pre-computer fantasy universes with big fan-bases (Battletech, Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer, Star Wars etc.) never managed to really transition seriously into computer games (a few hits but lots of misses and certainly no dominant series like warcraft and starcraft). I think the licencers of these worlds have been guilty of being far too greedy over the years as a general rule, and hurt their own pockets through doing so...<p>Also - great article. I loved playing Warcraft 1, and despite the fact that the 'RTS race' soon exploded and left it in the rear-vision mirror, it was still incredibly important in defining the genre... (as a side note, most of the other Blizzard games around this time were great too - must have been a great team).",1343260679

This approach, I think, made Zynga (at least initially) successful where others couldnt believe you would spend money on ""buying fake stuff"".<p>Same way you can say about many other things. Going to the cinema. Its fake. You can't eat the picture, you can't take it with you, you cannot even record it for later. You pay for the ticket and that ticket buys you pleasure and happiness for 90 minutes, hopefully. But other than that, 90 minutes later you have nothing. Once could say: this is fake.<p>Therefore, people that buy ""fake"" pigs and harvest ""fake"" fields, would still pay real money for doing so, because Zynga made it look and feel so great that the result (pleasure) is worth paying real money.<p>The true reason why Zynga is falling through cracks, I believe, is because having fake farms that you pay with real money was a fashionable moment; something cool to do, but at some point, people got tired and it stopped being popular/trendy. That's it. Now its up to Zynga to figure whether they can keep users busy some other ways (and spend money), or they won't until they get delisted from Nasdaq and subsequently file for Chapter 11.<p>I believe in the latter.",1343260610

4293648,comment,4292843,4292843,7,0,femto,,,"I've written down my experience of tipping in Australia, as an illustration that the word ""tipping"" has different connotations in different cultures.<p>Historically, Australians don't tip.  During much of the the 20th century Australia had quite a strong (relative to the US) tradition of socialism and unionism, resulting in a strong set of minimum employment conditions.  There was very much a view that a decent living wage was an entitlement and a matter of dignity, not something that a worker should have to stoop to collect.  People didn't tip, since the common perception was that the potential tipee was as equally entitled to a minimum wage as the potential tipper.  Indeed, I'd say that people actively didn't tip as an act of homage to equality.<p>Tipping is probably more common today than in the past, and the above is being eroded, but I think the above is still generally true.  A tip is rarely expected, or let on to be expected, as that is a sure fire way not to get a tip.<p>I mention the above, in the supposition that it has connotations for a site like gittip that liberally uses the word ""tipping"".  Some cultures don't do tipping.  As an Australian, I'd be more inclined if the idea of compensation was being sold on a ""equity"" (as in fairness) basis rather than a giving basis.  I know it's semantics, but semantics does influence decisions.<p>I hope the above is constructive.",1343260389

Since the interface was so much slower than Firefox (probably due to all the custom drawing) I didn't bother to stick with it.<p>Apple has never really pushed Safari for Windows at all. The theory I've read that always made sense to me was that it was created to allow Windows developers to test pages without an iPhone (or later iPad).<p>But here we are a few years later and the cost of getting a Mac is lower than it was. Apple already has a ton more developers thanks to the iPhone and iPad. And if you just want to see ""will my site look good on an iPhone"" you can buy an iPod touch for ~$200.<p>I'm actually a bit surprised it took them this long.

But yeah, Warhammer 40K was inspirational too.<p>The artwork for the two alien races in Starcraft were each redone <i>three</i> separate times. The biggest challenge was that players couldn't easily (and quickly) grok the differences between the various units.<p>In Warcraft, you look at a lumber mill or barracks, and you have an idea what it is and what it might be used for. In Starcraft the difficulty was that -- upon initially playing the game -- it was tough to tell what any unit or building <i>did</i> for you.<p>Consequently making game units that looked visually familiar by including known sci-fi elements is useful in that -- when done well -- gives players a clue as to the function of a unit.<p>Or at least that's what we told ourselves when we ripped elements from other games & movies :)",1343259681

One would be to apply a loaded cost model to a product and then figure out gross margins on units. You can could equate product releases to inventory 'turns' and then craft a valuation factor which develops some sort of freshness metric. These all toy with the question of whether the user population is an independent or dependent variable in the valuation. If the user population is strongly influenced the rate of new game introduction for example, you would discount a decline of current users against the value created by the new titles. So in that case freshness would be the valuation metric not user population. Or you could say the population of casual game users is fixed, and the only ones who would consider a new Zynga game already have a relationship with the company (independent value). So if people stop playing Zynga games then have they stopped being casual gamers ?<p>I think there is a lot of new territory here that is just being explored now.",1343259677

Other than picking up a game at a good price and automatically getting game patches from Steam, there was really nothing great about it. They had virtually no support. Your best bet was the forums. Throttled downloads were really fun too. Especially when you download a 5-gig game pack and have to sit there and resume your download every 5 minutes. Constant startup issues. I was patiently waiting for Battlefield 3 and was delighted to find out that EA decided to ditch Steam for this release, however their own Origin platform wasn't much better. Honestly, If i had to pick between slightly higher prices  at the stores and Steam - i'd pick the stores. With app stores rolling in all over different platforms i'm afraid to say there is going to be very little room for Steam and this is probably a good thing.

Facebook profiles reflect the human predilection for lying--to oneself and to others--about who they are and who they appear to be.<p>Don't get me wrong: Facebook could be a valuable display ad property. That just doesn't, by itself, make a $100B company.<p>You can count me as one of those that'll dance on the grave of Zynga however. The same goes for Groupon.<p>EDIT: regarding ""parasitic"", I refer you to Zynga's notion of ""whales"" [3] [4]. As much as Zynga might publicly state that these people might just be rich, I think they well know they're preying on those who are largely without self-control, intentionally cultivating addictive behaviour.<p>Some are OK with this. I am not. I see this as no different to encouraging gambling or drug addicts. YMMV.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424052970204621904577018373223480802-lMyQjAxMTAxMDAwOTEwNDkyWj.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB1000142405297020462190...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/technology/silicon-valley-wakes-up-to-clawback-culture-06292011.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/technology/silicon-valley-wakes-...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-06/tech/31028725_1_social-games-social-network-engineer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-06/tech/31028725...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-05/tech/31123148_1_of-zynga-facebook-games-mafia-wars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-05/tech/31123148...</a>",1343257732

All he did was compute an average and list some individual amounts raised.<p>Also, a 10x return is the sort of target a VC will have for a series A round.  Investors in later stage rounds have lower expectations. And since later stage rounds are much bigger, that means most of the money invested in a successful startup is done with the expectations of way less than 10x returns.<p>From what I know, I would guess that the investor of the median dollar of that billion is happy with the way things are going so far.",1343257265

It makes it very hard to stand out and you just fall off the front page really fast.  There is too much noise and everything gets the same billing regardless of quality, unless you hit a top sales spot.  However, top sales spots frequently have less to do with quality and more to do with appealing to the lowest common denominator.<p>Just look at the ios app store, the top is generally freemium games or games that are actually thinly veiled skinner boxes with some nice art.  Either that or casual games that have broad appeal because they are simple games.<p>On Steam you get top billing for at least 2 weeks after release.<p>Some open store examples: Desura, Indievania, XBLIG, android, even the mac app store is pretty open compared to Steam.",1343257224

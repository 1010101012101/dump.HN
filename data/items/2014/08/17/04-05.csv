This assumption is necessary, and basically correct, when distinguishing Japanese encodings from Chinese encodings. It&#x27;s even pretty much taken as a given that you can&#x27;t have Japanese and Chinese text in the same document without contortions that most developers are unwilling to go through.<p>But European languages and encodings are much more intermixed than that.

8188597,comment,8184265,8186652,2,0,eastbayjake,,,"I think your assumption about the tax increase is way off. The deduction is for the _interest_ paid on a mortgage. Let&#x27;s assume you buy a $400,000 home with 20% down and a 30-year loan with a 4.5% interest rate. Because it&#x27;s a deduction -- not a tax credit -- your savings in the first year is only about $6600, and that savings decreases every year after that as interest becomes a decreasing portion of each payment.<p>I don&#x27;t think people are going to avoid homeownership in droves because of $6600 per year -- especially people who are in the financial position to own a home.

One of the worst offenders is Microsoft Outlook, which sends emails using local 8-bit windows codepage by default, instead of utf-8.

It seems to cover a larger number of encoding mixups compared to other libraries, that&#x27;s great!<p>Comment to rspeer: in fix_text_segment(), I would limit the number of recursive passes on the text to 5-10.

You can spray Roundup without a patent license. You can probably plant RR crops without a license. But if you do both (commercially, at least), Monsanto sues.\nThe point of RR seeds is that they resist Roundup, which is a broad-spectrum herbicide that will kill non-RR crops. In the commercial suits, it becomes tricky to argue that you planted RR crops unwittingly when you are later shown to have sprayed them with an herbicide that would have certainly ruined your harvest but for inbred RR resistance.&quot;</i><p>There are a lot of actions that, if we described the component behaviors, would sound legitimate -- but taken in aggregate are clearly wrong.  It&#x27;s legal to be in the forest and it&#x27;s legal to discharge a firearm, but it becomes illegal if you knowingly target a person in the forest with that firearm.  It&#x27;s legal to change your clothes and wear a fake beard, and normally legal to go into a grocery store, but it becomes illegal if you disguise yourself to circumvent a store ban.  And it&#x27;s legal to have RR seeds in your field and it&#x27;s legal to spray roundup, but it becomes illegal if you intentionally try to circumvent Monsanto&#x27;s patents by using roundup to isolate their seeds and then intentionally replant those so that you&#x27;ll be able to use roundup on your crops without destroying your crops and without paying the standard fee.",1408250763

8188585,comment,8185021,8188270,4,0,smutticus,,,"I just finished reading &#x27;Homage to Catalonia&#x27; and &#x27;Down and Out in Paris and London&#x27;. Two early Orwell novels that possibly reveal more of his political thinking than either &#x27;Animal Farm&#x27;, or &#x27;1984&#x27;.<p>Homage is great. What I came away with was a profound sense of how ideology and labels are completely destructive to clear political understanding. This is really a running theme in Orwell&#x27;s work. Once one identifies as a &#x27;this&#x27; or a &#x27;that&#x27; one becomes beholden to its leaders, or whomever might be wagging &#x27;this&#x27; or &#x27;that&#x27; dog.<p>His reference and definition of Trotskyism in Homage sticks with me the most. When Poum are labelled Trotskyists it&#x27;s never made clear what Trotskyists actually are, only that they&#x27;re bad, and somehow counter to goodness. This appears again in his discussion of how Stalin, American and British interests want Fascism to fail, but actually dread any real social revolution in Spain more than Fascism. So they&#x27;re not willing to arm anarchists against Fascists. The eventual suppression of Poum and the anarchists by Communists loyal only to the USSR, ultimately ruins any chance the Republicans might have had.<p>It was a fascinating read, and it must be read by anyone interested in understanding the Spanish Civil war, or Orwell. One can see where Orwell got the idea for &#x27;2 legs bad, 4 legs good&#x27; --> &#x27;4 legs good, 2 legs better&#x27; in &#x27;Animal Farm&#x27; from his experience in Spain.<p>This scene from chapter 10 sticks in my mind. Orwell is approached by a Communist friend and asked to join their unit. This is after Communist propoganda has started to paint the Poum as &#x27;counter revolutionary&#x27;.<p>&quot;I had to tell him that after this affair I could not join any Communist-controlled unit. Sooner or later it might mean being used against the Spanish working class. One could not tell when this kind of thing would break out again, and if I had to use my rifle at all in such an affair I would use it on the side of the working class and not against them. He was very decent about it. But from now on the whole atmosphere was changed. You could not, as before, &#x27;agree to differ&#x27; and have drinks with a man who was supposedly your political opponent.&quot;<p>Orwell wants the reader to understand that these various &#x27;isms&#x27; and &#x27;ists&#x27; are extremely susceptible to internal corruption. No matter what their initial beliefs. In addition he strongly discouraged &#x27;mealy mouthed&#x27; language, and imprecision. &#x27;Doublespeak&#x27; from &#x27;1984&#x27; and his essay on &#x27;Politics and the English Language&#x27; are all about this strongly held belief of his. He skill and precision at writing allowed him to more easily deconstruct propoganda, and he was frustrated by the misuse of language for political manipulation.<p>So any notion someone might have that Orwell was a &#x27;this&#x27; or a &#x27;that&#x27; is utter hogwash. He would never identify himself as anything, for he knew that once he did that something would alter its form to something terrible.",1408250675

If your child becomes really interested in the law, he will have unlimited time to pursue that goal. If your child is really interested in math, he will be able to study that in a much deeper way than someone similarly into math attending public or private school. He can learn not only at his own pace, but his own depth.<p>My younger brother, also unschooled, quickly began reading so he could use the computer and google things (like funny YouTube videos) but later things like free drawing applications (independently finding and installing Inkscape) and emulators (learning on his own how to install, find, and download, and play emulations of old NES and N64 games, around age 8) - which in my mind requires not only reading and literacy but deep comprehension. My point is, their passions will drive their knowledge. I think if you have a passion for technology, math, etcetera it will inevitably rub off on your children.

The 2009 findings were somewhat favorable to conventional public schools—although not as favorable as some skeptics argued. The 2013 findings appear to show some improvement for charters, with great variation between schools and between states—and with an overall national estimate of students in charter schools scoring approximately 0.01 standard deviations higher on reading tests and 0.005 standard deviations lower on math tests than their peers in conventional public schools (the former being statistically significant; the latter not). That is, the ‘findings’ question can be answered as follows: small differences shown in 2009 are even smaller in 2013. The CREDO findings are highly consistent with an overall body of research concluding that the test-score outcomes of the sectors are almost identical.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/09/24/the-bottom-line-on-charter-school-studies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/09/...</a>",1408249774

Children who receive no formal instruction in arithmetic catch up with their agemates who have been receiving that instruction and are better at word problems.

Pay them well, give them support, infrastructure, and enough oversight to help them resolve their issues quickly and effectively...and then just trust them to be productive and successful.<p>Is it a lack of funding that stops this from being a reality? A lack of qualified applicants? Is there a good reason this model wouldn&#x27;t work?",1408248328

It&#x27;s when government is involved that there is restriction on that activity, which frequently has unintended effects.  If there is inadequate planning for future demand then prices may certainly vary more than is considered acceptable.  Poor planning on a utility&#x27;s part is not the fault of capitalism, but which seems to be the major point of the article and the original poster.  Indeed, selling future contracts is generally viewed as a good way to stabilize future prices as it gives a signal as to general (market) consensus - if insurance for some activity is considered expensive then it should tell even the minimal of planners that an activity has unevaluated risk.  An inability to act properly on such signals does indeed indicate poor planning on one party&#x27;s part.",1408248324

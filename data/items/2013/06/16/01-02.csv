In two of them, they were paid the going rate. If you&#x27;re not getting paid, or getting paid a stipend, then it may be fair to use the start-up as a sort of experiment - the cool experience may be all you get out of it - but this should at least be agreed upon. However, if you&#x27;re getting paid the going rate, then this is a job, not a party, and your job is to get the job done.<p>Lets be honest, this sort of thing goes on at large companies too for two reasons: resume stuffing, and job security code. My favorite is when someone builds some really &quot;cool&quot; tech that only they understand, uses it to get a new job, and then quits. If a manager lets this happen, they ought to be fired too, in my opinion.",1371347998

I appreciate your informed input here.<p>But still, as I described in the post, all these bits of tooling that other developers write seem to break all the time anyway.  If you look at the quote from the Alembic developer, you can read the level of frustration and spent time that&#x27;s been put into this.  If this is how it&#x27;s going to work, why not just do it in one location, as I said?  All this tooling that&#x27;s trying to add workarounds seems to be constantly breaking.  I think that sqlite could do a better job implementing that logic itself.  At the moment, with MediaGoblin, we&#x27;re trapped and our developers and users are fighting these problems on a very regular basis.<p>I believe that the constant reimplementation of this in migration frameworks is indication enough that it really is desired and would be useful.

What I said was that CNN, NYT etc all conform to the official Washington party line.<p>But now that you brought it up, I can also say this: CNN is as much an instrument of the US state, as Xinhua is.<p>Of course CNN is privately run, and also pays lip service to journalistic independence and stuff, but that&#x27;s just how this thing works over there. That&#x27;s like Google saying &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot; or McDonalds touting the quality of it&#x27;s products: i.e. only for very naive people.<p>You might like this:<p>&quot;As Major Thomas Collins, of the U.S. Army Information Service acknowledged: &quot;Psyops personnel, soldiers and officers, have been working in CNN&#x27;s headquarters in Atlanta through our programme &#x27;Training With Industry&#x27;. They worked as regular employees of CNN. Conceivably, they would have worked on stories during the Kosovo war. They helped in the production of news.&quot;&quot;<p>Or this:<p>&quot;In an extraordinary directive to its staff, Cable News Network has instructed reporters and anchormen to tailor their coverage of the US war against Afghanistan to downplay the toll of death and destruction caused by American bombing, for fear that such coverage will undermine popular support for the US military effort&quot;.<p>Or this:<p>In a second memo leaked to the Post, CNNs head of standards and practices, Rick Davis, expressed concern about reports on the bombing of Afghanistan filed by on-the-spot reporters. Davis noted that it may be hard for the correspondent in these dangerous areas to make the points clearly about the reasons for the US bombing. In other words, the CNN official feared that overseas correspondents might be intimidated by local opposition to the US military intervention and allow such sentiments to influence their reports.<p>To ensure that every CNN report always includes a justification of the war, Davis prescribed specific language for anchors to read after each account of civilian casualties and other bomb damage. He suggested three alternative formulations:<p>* We must keep in mind, after seeing reports like this from Taliban-controlled areas, that these US military actions are in response to a terrorist attack that killed close to 5,000 innocent people in the US.\n* We must keep in mind, after seeing reports like this, that the Taliban regime in Afghanistan continues to harbor terrorists who have praised the September 11 attacks that killed close to 5,000 innocent people in the US.\n* The Pentagon has repeatedly stressed that it is trying to minimize civilian casualties in Afghanistan, even as the Taliban regime continues to harbor terrorists who are connected to the September 11 attacks that claimed thousands of innocent lives in the US.\nDavis concluded with an ultimatum to journalists concerned that they may sound like parrots for the White House: Even though it may start sounding rote, it is important that we make this point each time.<p><a href=""http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2001/11/cnn-n06.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2001/11/cnn-n06.html</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird</a><p><a href=""http://www.counterpunch.org/2000/03/26/cnn-and-psyops/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.counterpunch.org/2000/03/26/cnn-and-psyops/</a>",1371347123
5887053,comment,5886898,5886898,45,0,rogerbinns,,,"I am very familiar with SQLite internals.  The answer is already in there.  SQLite stores each row as each column value encoded sequentially corresponding to the declared order of the columns.  Changing column order or deletions/inserts require a rewrite of every row.  The one special case that is allowed is adding a column on the end of the schema providing it has a default value.<p>A SQLite provided ALTER TABLE implementation would do exactly what was stated - start a transaction, rename the existing table to a temporary name, create a new one with the desired schema, and copy data across mangling as appropriate before deleting the old table and finishing the transaction.  For plain tables this is no big deal, but for more complicated ones there are a lot of issues such as foreign key references, constraints, indices.  The majority of the code would be dealing with all these conditions and interactions.<p>It also wouldn&#x27;t be any more efficient than code the developer writes - ie there are no shortcuts available to the SQLite developers that aren&#x27;t available to developers using SQLite.  The net effect would be a larger library (they limit to a 250kb library size so something else would need to be chopped), some complex documentation and a heck of a lot of testing code.  For something that is relatively rarely needed (see requests on the mailing lists).<p>The chance of something like this ending up in the SQLite core is extremely slim, so you could never depend on it being there anyway.<p>SQLite does have several things to help.  There is a user_version pragma you can use to keep track of the schema version and use for upgrading.  You can temporarily disable foreign key and constraint enforcing.  There are numerous pragmas to get table metadata.  The table definitions are stored as SQL strings in a sqlite master table, and a pragma allows you to make that writeable.",1371347066

Also, that kind of specialized design costs money:<p><i>It&#x27;s like buying a suit.

The guy that locked his keys in the car?  Or the ones the FBI convinces others to attempt?  The NSA has been doing this for a long time and have missed things like the Boston bombing while there was plenty of evidence that required further observance.  Just looking at some of his public photos, it was apparent to me that he probably should be observed.  Those didn&#x27;t even require these new legal means.<p>Don&#x27;t you think if they did successfully stop a really major terrorist attack either Bush or Obama would have ran with it in the open?  If it happened in 2008, Obama probably wouldn&#x27;t have been elected because people would have loved to see these new [horrible] laws stop 9/11 part 2.  Bush would have said something like &quot;We told you we needed this and we were right.  Without these laws we wouldn&#x27;t have been able to catch them.  These laws saved thousands of lives today and will continue to do so in the future.&quot;<p>However, here we are and nothing major has been found.  Now they have the potential for political blackmail that can stop all sorts of challenges to the establishment.  One thing many people agree is that Congress sucks and both parties are out of touch with us.  They will use these legal means in order to hold onto their power.  I do not trust them in the least.<p>Also, if they can do this, why can&#x27;t we attach live camera and microphones to all of them?  Why can&#x27;t we make all of their emails public?  They want this access to us, why can&#x27;t we have it for them?",1371344486

5848541,comment,5848540,5848540,1,0,marcodena,,,"&quot;Now when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be that, &quot;Okay, that sounds bad, but that doesn&#x27;t really affect me because I&#x27;m a legal citizen. Why should I worry? Because I have nothing to hide.&quot; And this is an argument, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Privacy is implied. Privacy is not up for discussion. This is not a question between privacy against security. It&#x27;s a question of freedom against control. And while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011, any right we give away will be given away for good. And do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government, a government we might have 50 years from now? And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years.&quot;",1370779156

(Though I&#x27;d assume that as long as a &quot;virtual wiretap&quot; is in place on an individual the NSA gets a firehose of everything which happens to that user account (or at least everything the FISA order permits) and then just filters out whatever doesn&#x27;t interest it.) For my part I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if &quot;The companies cannot see the queries that are sent from the NSA to the systems installed on their premises&quot; just turns out to mean &quot;The connection between the on-site server and Fort Meade is protected by SSL&quot; (and probably dedicated fibre). To someone looking at the NSA as the bad wolf here it sounds like an odd thing to emphasise, but from the perspective of an actual NSA agent the security of these off-site servers handling top-secret material (in an environment full of highly-technical leftists and libertarians!) must be an obvious concern.

If they&#x27;d immediately just released a nearly-the-same version and iterated from there the entire Nexuiz community would have brought along to the new project.  Instead, the developers treated Xonotic as their chance to change everything, so you ended up with drastically different gameplay and no map-file compatibility.<p>This inevitably led to a split where some people like the changes overall, and others still cling to the 4-year-old Nexuiz 2.5.2 release.  Worse, neither group is large enough to really have a healthy ecosystem of active players.   Nexuiz was already in decline before the fork, but splitting the community in two hastened it considerably.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, I really liked Nexuiz a lot... fast pace and interesting movement system.

After getting to know some of the members, you might be able to work something out like trading some beers/coffees for their time. It&#x27;s hard to give specifics to how to find a mentor, but patience and an understanding of how to relate concepts to someone learning are the key for anyone teaching.<p>I found from mentoring friends a few years younger than me in school that it not only improved their own programming skills, but mine as well. Mainly because it makes you rethink how you interpret concepts so you can relate them to someone who doesn&#x27;t understand them as well yet (which is also a useful skill when talking to clients or bosses that aren&#x27;t developers). Sometimes you also learn something new (as no university covers 100% exactly the same material, though most are generally similar).

5848458,comment,5847483,5848103,2,0,vidarh,,,"With this you directly contradict your earlier claim that:<p>> Without nationalism how can there be any tradition of local governance? And without that how can local culture survive? Or is your point hat local culture shouldn&#x27;t survive and that the Hopi child should be governed by the same cultural norms as the Swedish?<p>Whether or not one agrees with your claim that pre-nation state forms of group loyalty or tribalism were equivalent to nationalism, you here yourself divorce the existence of traditions of local governance from your interpretation of nationalism (&quot;The difference is that traditionally loyalty to one&#x27;s nation was separate to loyalty to one&#x27;s government.&quot;)<p>The point is that culture and governance are not implicitly linked, and did not used to be. Contrary to your implication in the quoted part that the lack of nationalism would be a treat to survival of local culture, on the contrary, the rise of modern nationalism has had a substantial effect in threatening many cultures. A lot of nation states have explicitly set out to eradicate alternative cultures. Witness the Turkish state long held insistence that there were no such thing as Kurds, for example - just &quot;mountain Turks&quot; - and the number of states that at various times have outlawed the teaching of minority languages (including, again, Turkey) or even mentioning the minority (I knew a Turkish journalist in Norway as an asylum seeker because he had received death threats from the Turkish government because he was writing about the plight of the Kurds).<p>In Norway too, since you bring up Scandinavia and I&#x27;m Norwegian, a lot of modern culture are constructs of modern nationalism: Our two official languages are both artificial and recent - one constructed as an amalgamation of dialects spoken around the country, and one constructed largely from Danish, and are increasingly pushing local dialects aside. Around Oslo, for example, many kids are not even aware that their speech has elements of old distinct dialects, and no effort is made to preserve them (note that I am not arguing that they <i>should</i> be preserved - I don&#x27;t particular care about the preservation of such dialects).<p>Unlike in most English speaking languages, the government even dictates the vocabulary and the rules of the language.<p>Most of the mythos and trappings of the Norwegian national identify date from ~1800 onwards, especially as constructions of the Norwegian national romanticism movement from the 1840&#x27;s onwards.<p>This modern Norwegian culture that arose as a result is largely the result of a local elite that stimulated and utilised this nationalism as a means of asserting power and/or making their local seats more prominent in the face of a government in Copenhagen that had for hundreds of years let Norway remain a under-developed backwater.<p>First in trying to gain independence in 1814 when Denmark-Norway was sufficiently weakened by having been on the losing side of the Napoleonic Wars, and they managed to get recognition for our constitution, and then again to build popular support for full independence from Sweden after we were handed over to Sweden as a &quot;price&quot; to the Swedes for supporting the victors.<p>Norwegian nationalism then on one and preserved some local traditions, but it homogenised them, distorted them, and discarded any elements that did not fit in, and created a mythos of a historical Norwegian nation that was in some respects pure fiction - if you look at Norwegian representations of the viking era, you might be forgiven to think that vikings were all Norwegian, for example, (Danish and Swedish vikings gets the occasional mention, but not much considering the major empires they built) and that this was our defining characteristic. Yet the viking era was culturally largely forgotten and ignored for hundreds of years - Norway was a country of farmers and fishermen, even during the viking era.<p>The lyrics to our <i>national anthem</i> even is one long national romantic representation of a myth of some thousand year tradition of a unified Norwegian nation.<p>So not only is nationalism not a pre-requisite for protecting culture - it has been a major driver for steamrollering older local cultures over the last century in particular.<p>But even if you want to apply your interpretation of pre-nation state proto-nationalism of sorts, Norway is a prime example of how this actively suppresses rather than preserved local culture: Norway was christened, as many other countries, through violence. King Olav the Holy travelled the country and introduced legislation based on establishing Christianity as a state religion through threats and use of force, actively encouraging the eradication of ancient traditions",1370776973

5848452,comment,5848113,5848113,37,0,pron,,,"Not taking one side or the other, it&#x27;s important to note that when it comes to nutrition, we know very little. Or rather, we know many disparate facts but very little about how they interact. The reason is that there are very few good &quot;unit tests&quot; for human physiology, and we&#x27;re not even sure about what <i>they</i> really mean (for example, current research suggests that what we thought we knew about the significance of blood cholesterol levels might be wrong). And if all we have are &quot;integration tests&quot; (like mortality rates), the number of variables affecting them becomes so huge, that in order to get truly statistically significant results we would need to conduct randomized trials on very big populations. Add the difficulty of conducting a double-blind randomized nutrition trial even on a small population, and you get results that have little actual &quot;results&quot; (although a randomized double-blind trial with vitamin pills is possible).<p>When John Ioannidis proved that most published medical research is false[1], he singled out genetics and nutrition[2] as the two most problematic fields, where very, very few findings are true. The fact is that we know alarmingly little about what constitutes a healthy diet. Let me clarify: we know hardly anything about significant difference in total health one relatively &quot;normal&quot; diet has over another. Ioannidis&#x27;s advice: completely ignore any nutritional &quot;scientific&quot; claims because they are anything but. Any supposed claims for &quot;healthy&quot; eating are no more than wishful thinking, pseudoscience and good-old snake-oil salesmanship.<p>What is interesting from a scientific point of view, and this is one subject we know a lot more about than actual nutrition, is <i>why</i> people who are otherwise scientific minded skeptics are superstitious when it comes to nutrition (if you believe that eating more green vegetable or less, consuming more vitamin C or less, more saturated fat or less is actually better for you, then you are superstitious, unless you are knowingly placing a scientifically unfounded bet on one diet over another).<p>Obviously, the well-known psychology of magical thinking applies to everyone, and even skeptics are not immune to it (Charles Darwin, if one anecdote about him is correct, quite amazingly identified the effect magical thinking had on his own research, and took measures to counteract it). But why is food such a focus of superstition among skeptics? It probably has to do with their political leaning.<p>Jonathan Haidt hypothesizes that the value of &quot;purity&quot; is ingrained in human existence, and every society seeks to fill it with particular meaning[3]. Because liberals wholly reject giving &quot;purity&quot; sexual or racial content, they choose to purify themselves through health, and in particular, food. It seems that people have such a strong desire to feel pure, that those that cannot achieve it through religious means, try to achieve it with food. And because food is, after all, subject to scientific study (though mostly bogus), it gives that little something to grab onto and construct magical thinking around.<p>Consider this if you don&#x27;t believe me: pick one scientific nutritional finding that you particularly like, and have chosen to adhere to. Let&#x27;s suppose that the finding is true as published. Now, look at what statistical effect-size that particular research claims your chosen diet has. For example, by how much does it prolong life? 10%? 5%? 3%? Or by how much does it reduce the risk of getting a particular form of cancer? Does it take it from 1/100 to 1/10000? Or, perhaps, from 1/1000 to 1/1200?<p>Now think if in other areas of life, such effect-sizes would change your behavior as much.<p>Theres definitely a lot of psychology when it comes to people&#x27;s diets. Science? Not so much.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-medical-science/308269/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-dam...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.ht...</a>",1370776811

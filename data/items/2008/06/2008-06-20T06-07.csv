It may mean that it's easier to start selling, but also that you have no negotiating power if and when your app becomes a success.<p>The stupid music companies managed to hand over the keys to their distribution to Steve Jobs, but they're not exactly happy about the fact that he now has so much control over their fate. Apple's great at creating consumer electronics that actually appeals to people, but they don't seem to be a very nice company to deal with as a business.",1213945109

222510,comment,221710,221880,0,0,maurycy,,,"Most people add little value to the society. Please see Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.<p>In my opinion, what is education, and the whole welfare state, about is creating the best environment for the high archievers, and not limiting them needlessly. The thing is that no one knows which family raises a genius. That is why all children, and thus their parents, should have the slighty the same starting environment, or at least the guaranteed minimum.<p>One side note is that most educational reforms perceive the education as a thing separated from the society. It is not truth. For instance, it is harder to be a high archiever if your parents lack the social and cultural capital. And the financial capital's role is way less important than before.<p>The yet another side note is that enormous time, at least in Polish education, is wasted on propaganda and socialization. This time could be spent better.",1213944568

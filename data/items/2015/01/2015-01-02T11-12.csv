This is partly due to decreasing the bite of transaction fees but mostly because building a business on $1.50 transactions is really, really, really, really hard when Steve Jobs has not already arranged a captive audience with credit cards on file.<p>One of the traditional solutions in e.g. social games is selling a virtual currency in $10, $20, $50, etc increments and then using the virtual currency to effect small-value payments.  For example, $10 gets you 7 dragon eggs, $20 gets you 15 (one bonus egg!)  The thing you were thinking of selling for $1.50 now costs 1 dragon egg.  This both helps you get your average purchase up, saves your processing costs, and also increases transaction volume by not having people feel like they&#x27;re being asked for $1.50 on a frequent basis.

It sounds like they take an SSH identity certificate from the agent, send it via TLS, and then the remote process verifies it. This would have fewer potential security issues than trying to lock down a user&#x27;s SSH login shell.",1420199177

Any type that defines a &#x27;+&#x27; operator is &quot;Additive&quot;.<p>In most industrial languages, integers, floats and strings are Additive, because these things support the &#x27;+&#x27; operator.<p>Monads are at the same level of &quot;concept&quot; as Additive. Something is a monad if it has a set of operators that map to the Monad concept. The level of abstraction you need to be at, mentally, is &quot;supports a specific set of operations with specific rules&quot;. A lot like an interface, but at the type level.<p>It is definitely a single concept, but there are variations on it, like Functor and Applicative, which are related. The core concept is adding a layer of indirection between a value and application of a function to the value. What the indirection does is the chief distinguishing feature of the monad. A Maybe monad only applies the function if the value is not None, for example. A List monad applies the function to each value in the list. The IO monad, on the other hand, logically stores the function and keeps it for later - the result of computing a pure functional Haskell program returning IO is an imperative program, which is then executed. That&#x27;s how Haskell gets its side-effects in a pure fashion.",1420199099

8826425,comment,8824691,8825882,0,0,Futurebot,,,"I have a different read on that. Control doesn&#x27;t work if no one cares about social opprobrium. If the culture has changed so that whatever behavior you&#x27;re engaging in is no longer considered taboo / everyone else is doing it, you cannot be controlled by others using the threat of exposure against you (this doesn&#x27;t apply to behaviors that are actually made illegal, so would be protestors/dissidents get no help from this.) Now, some may say that that kind of change itself is bad (due to the newer [theorized] cultural control strategy of reverse desublimation in the west since the 1960s), but I think that ship has long sailed anyway.<p>For a basic example, let&#x27;s take visible public inebriation. If large numbers / the majority of people do that on a regular basis - and everyone can see it - how could you use that as a threat against people? Right now it can be used against, for example, potential job seekers because of information asymmetry (job seeker has photo of being drunk on a public post / interviewer keeps their drunken photos private.) In a world where everyone can see everyone (and archives are infinite / searchable) that power goes away. As Brin discusses in The Transparent Society, people avoid eavesdropping (or at least hide it) because they know others are looking - and IS a behavior that gets social opprobrium, and so is effectively policed. An important (and perhaps obvious) caveat to all this is that social policing only applies to people with roughly symmetrical levels of power (i.e., this doesn&#x27;t work for <i>government</i> surveillance - they can use much more powerful tools than shame / fear of exposure.)<p>I think another interesting thing to think about (that we have a recent data point on) is comment sections pre- and post- Facebook comments. It was often stated in the pre- area that real names attached to posts would prevent egregious public behavior due to shame / fear. What we&#x27;ve seen is that this is not the case. Comment sections using Facebook comments are still often filled with much of the ugliness they had before. Is it ignorance, foolishness, feelings of invulnerability, the belief that their opinions represent a silent majority? Hard to say, but I&#x27;d like to see someone take on that topic since we now have so much data on it.",1420199046

They didn&#x27;t think this situation could last - either the browser would be subsumed into the OS, or the OS would be subsumed into the browser, or they would merge somehow. This belief was shared by others at the time (e.g. Marc Andreessen&#x27;s famous declaration that the web would reduce Windows to &quot;a poorly debugged set of device drivers&quot;).

However, in the five years since, Jake&#x27;s articles have been basically all yakuza all the time, and tend to imply that the yakuza are everywhere in Japanese society, pulling strings all the time.<p>However, in actuality, the yakuza are slowly fading away.  The police started clamping down pretty hard in 1992 and have kept up the pressure ever since, with many traditional yakuza businesses like protection money, extortion becoming more and more difficult, and increasing societal pressure on yakuza members themselves.  Consequently, yakuza revenues and membership have plummeted, and infighting between groups fighting for slices of the remaining cake (drugs, gambling, illegal prostitution, etc) isn&#x27;t helping.  Here&#x27;s a summary, cowritten oddly enough by Jake himself, although he does somewhat unconvincingly claim that the yakuza are just going underground in response:<p><a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/09/where-have-japan-s-yakuza-gone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/09/where-have-...</a>",1420196597

The biggest problem would be scaling, since OpenVPN might load a server with just hundreds of active clients (<a href=""http://forums.openvpn.net/topic9148.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.openvpn.net/topic9148.html</a>), in which case a custom solution might be better...<p>Regardless of how they did it, very clever workaround!",1331387701

At some point, we will have automated too many of the ""useful"" things to do for there to be enough work in the private sector for everyone. There are only so many cars, houses, gadgets and foods humanity needs, and the efficiency in producing these things just keeps growing. I'm not saying that we are headed for a dystopia where no one has a regular job - quite the opposite - but during a transition period a lot of people will be without work. Arguably this is part of the reason joblessness is so common in the US today. We will have to find some sort of tax system that makes it possible for those who can't participate in the elite to also live their lives, and hopefully contribute with some creative pursuit.<p>A lot of people will find this transition difficult, because a lot of people simply have no direction in life and just keep doing rote work.

3687747,comment,3686840,3687207,3,0,Jach,,,"I don't really think this is the characterization of wester medicine. What you're calling for, ""Evidence-based medicine"", or ""Evidence-based practice"", is actually <i>new</i>. Bayesian probability theory is still nowhere near the dominant method of measuring certainty in the field.<p>I hope mmphosis clarifies what he means by ""western medicine"", because I'm confused by that term myself. It's not about the modern issue where the US FDA mandates that ""only a drug can cure, prevent, treat, or diagnose a disease"" (so if you try and sell oranges under the claim that they prevent scurvy you can be thrown in jail), since he mentioned 1000 years. I don't think he meant that western medicine has any less a desire than non-western medicine to ""make people better"".<p>I hope he doesn't mean homeopathy since I hope we can all agree that's a silly enterprise good only for making its proponents more money. But I suspect the ""western medicine"" refers to alternative treatments that don't have to be homeopathic. I think his overall meaning is that for current medical research, the memory of the field only goes back 1000 years or so, which may or may not be true. (I'd argue it's closer to 100 years.) It may be a call for more testing of what old societies used to do for various things, such as the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese, and whether any valid techniques are there that we should bring back. I seem to recall off-hand that St. John's Wort historically has a use for depression, and in some study had about the same effectiveness as some other depression drug (though neither were much better than a placebo); if this is really the case then we need more studies on St. John's Wort to confirm and in the US particularly we need some new FDA rules and reduction of power (or just get rid of them). A similar point is made when people say ""stop destroying rainforests, there may be a cure for cancer there!"" There probably isn't, but it's not like we were looking very hard anyway, and maybe we should.",1331386180

I really hope there will be some scrutiny of how Invisible Children spend this money. The US already has troops supporting the Ugandan military. Buying more guns for the Ugandan military won't solve the issue.<p>Another problem is that the constant portrayal of Africa as the dark continent helps keep Africa poor.

If you want a mature framework which solves most use cases for synchronous web programming and you can build powerful stuff on top of that, it's Django.",1331384670

What is different this time is this:<p>a) The transition will happen more quickly because the kind of intelligence you need to clean a room is very broadly applicable. It affects almost all manual tasks at the same time.<p>b) Contrary to earlier transitions, there will not be many tasks left that untrained people can perform and that are similar enough to the old ones.

I think a cat that began to eat one of these mice would be likely not to swallow the pills (just based on the fact that I've never managed to get a cat to take a pill hidden in cat food).",1284896695

The 2009 edition ITRS concluded that there's no significant remaining roadblocks for 22nm processes. They listed some challenges for 16nm but they do expect to overcome all these obstacles in time to keep Moore's law going for at least another 5 years. No manufacturer that I know of have said that 22nm is going to be a limit. In fact Taiwanese researchers have already produced a 16nm SRAM chip in Dec 2009:<p><a href=""http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xitem=87144&CtNode=416"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xitem=87144&CtNode=416</a>",1284896670

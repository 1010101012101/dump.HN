I'm upvoting, because I don't want this comment to disappear, but it's still wrong-headed.<p>1. Answering the first quesiton directly:<p>No, that's not the solution proposed by the article. The goal was to get the poor involved in politics, in the largest sense of the word. At the end, he reported that almost everyone in the first class was either in school or employed full-time. No mention of managerial roles, or what they were training to be. One tried to start a union, so she is not heading towards a managerial role.<p>There are plenty of programs out there that do try to train people in technical skills, like nursing, engineering, or management, but this was _not_ one of those programs. This is a way to help the poor break out of the vicious cycle of poverty themselves by giving them the tools to think about their situation. Who knows what they'll do with those tools.<p>2. Answering the second question, allowing for your premise:<p>Robots, programmed by all of these engineers we wouldn't've had otherwise, and the people that are too poor to be helped, or unable for other reasons. This is what we call a _good_ problem.<p>3. Making fun of you/sarcasm:<p>OK, sure, lets not help the poor at all, because what if we're _too successful?!?_ That would be horrible! We'd starve to death in dirty streets, because people would be too busy nursing, engineering, and managing each other, and not realize there was no food!<p>4. Rejecting your premise and addressing the second question:<p>Who's going to do the blue collar jobs? Mostly the same kinds of people that do them now, except they will have more political empowerment, and a greater capacity for reflection and critical thinking. I know a few educated people that choose to work as farmhands, so it's not impossible, and I myself enjoy an ""honest day's work"" (speaking as someone with the privilege of an education in the humanities).<p>Can you imagine how awesome it would be if we had a society of critical thinkers and moral philosophers, instead of the reactionary, anti-intellectual, gullible, fundamentalist society we have now[1]? Can you imagine if the lowest common denominator weren't so low? I'm not saying it would be a utopia, but for at least the last few hundred years, people have been dreaming of a time when machines had taken over every menial task, and humans could spend their time as they wished, free to follow pursuits of their own choosing.<p>[1] I'm not trying to say 100% of society is like that I'm just saying that significant fractions of the American population at least show one or more of these characteristics, and I don't think it's making for a better society.",1340340360

And to be sure, the financial industry has been given too much rope to hand out credit without enough risk.<p>But I seem to recall seeing many other forums about university, mortgages, etc, where people who's parents paid for their education, helped with a house, etc, are ridiculed - and I don't mean super rich dynastic trust fund babies....<p>It only takes a generation and some common thinking for a family to stick together and get <i>ahead</i>, and ensure their children never need to borrow money from a bank to get an education, or buy a house.  You don't have to be rich... but why can't we live, you know, a generation ahead?  \nI know a guy who told me his parents paid for all his stuff, his house, etc, and therefore all his work and all that (good  tech guy) was just being saved up for HIS kids, ad-infinitum.  They aren't trying to be rich - they just stay a generation ahead.<p>How many people, 10 years into their working life, have a year's minimum expenses in liquid cash, a cushion, just in case? How about 6 months?  Most don't even have 2 weeks.... most live <i>hours</i> away from disaster if they don't get paid on time, and they blame everyone else.  Get a couple months ahead and you no longer think about when payday is.... it's not relevant.\nWant to be an entrepreneur? great. Do it. \nPeople don't understand what money is for, or how to really use it to their advantage.   They learn abou their ""credit rating"" - that's it.<p>My rules:\n- There's nothing wrong with cash in the bank (really secure, liquid assetts).  People tell you you are losing out because of inflation..... most of those people got smashed when the stock market crashed.   I'm not knocking investment, I'm just saying, cash is okay.  I've weathered the ups and downs of the financial world without worry or concern while everyone else was freaking out. \nA good credit rating is good - but it should be a side effect of good financial practices, not a goal in and of itself. \nMy credit rating probably isn't great - it's not <i>bad</i> because I've done nothing wrong, but I haven't borrowed large sums and paid them back, that kind of thing.<p>Credit cards should work for you, they are not a privilege. They should protect you from risk of theft, and help you balance out and manage cache flow. They should never be used for money you don't have.  There are other ways to go about that (and in a circle of friends with similar practices, you borrow from friends - imagine a society based on the same)<p>Avoid debt.  Debt is okay - but don't get over your head... stay far, far away from that kind of debt.   Debt carries a psychological burden as well.... for me it feels great knowing that when I get paid, my money is mine.  If I borrow some money, pay some interest so I can keep some liquidity rather than spend cash on something big the interest payments are worth keeping my security cushion adequate - but if push comes to shove, I can just pay it off - that's what I mean.<p>You want a simple credit card without fees or nasty interest rates. You want protection and no nonsense.\nYou want cash in the bank, always growing - I don't mean retirement savings, I mean a cushion - it should grow all the time.  After 20 years of working you should be in a position where you could have no job for a year or more without screwing up your life. (not saying you SHOULD do that, you probably shouldn't - but you should be able to - that makes negotating salaries and dealing with employers much, much easier).<p>It's really simple.\nAvoid debt.\nBuild and <i>keep adding to</i> a cash cushion.  Dip in once in a while, no problem, but keep it growing.  It'll hurt at first, but before long you'll LOVE it.

I'm not sure if 1.8.7 broke the old one or if 1.9 did.<p>Ruby 1.9 broke ""when 5:"" in case statements. Files also started needing ""# Coding: UTF-8"" comments.

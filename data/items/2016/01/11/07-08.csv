Next time I make a purchase of a chip, or a product using it, I may check on this to the extent of my ability. I might not go without a laptop if I can&#x27;t acquire it without causing harm, but I will certainly prefer to minimize such harm if possible.<p>My hypothesis is that if you give people easy ways to do the right thing, they tend to value doing so[1]. It is one thing to know &quot;vague horrible things happen elsewhere to give me my current standard of living&quot; and a different one to provide actionable and timely choices to diminish that harm. So it&#x27;s good that companies are improving their practices and making that a marketing point (even if &quot;we are better that the competition... because we decided to recently stop funding warlords&quot; is perhaps a fairly low standard). In the end, the right solutions may go beyond this, involving regulations and government incentives and treaties, and stronger governance developing in affected countries; but as far as what Intel can do and what individual consumers can do, it is still something.<p>[1] Failing that, one can advocate for taxing the wrong the choice (Banning the wrong choice might work too, if a reasonable substitute exists. May backfire otherwise, see: drugs).",1452499066

10879466,comment,10877810,10879103,0,0,BinaryIdiot,,,"> Detecting the features available in the browser is potentially two requests: the server sends HTML/JS to the client, the client makes a decision, and then requests more data that&#x27;s compatible with its feature set. If the server can do feature detection by user agent sniffing, it&#x27;s potentially one request.<p>That&#x27;s not really true though. The code that&#x27;s going to load the video will be downloaded and then the code will request the video. So those two requests happen no matter what. Cache the feature detection so it&#x27;s slightly faster after the first time.<p>> The client has to do this for every browser session, too, since browsers are frequently upgraded and the features change week-to-week.<p>Browsers are unlikely to lose the ability to use whatever codec you think is best so I think this is a safe assumption.

Three of them -- the profitable ones you hear about -- have licenses from the federal government. Those licenses entitle their ratings to a presumption of validity in front of bank regulators and under pension and investment rules. Yes, institutions that the government backs are entitled to invest or blocked from investing your money, whether you like it or not, based on what the rating agencies say.<p>So they&#x27;re quasi government bodies with the power to defraud you through the banks and pensions you are mandated to use and to grant government bailout guarantees you will pay for in your taxes. In return, they make lots of guaranteed cash and empower the banking system to skim more and more pension funds and investment fees from you.<p>The sad bit is that this actually works better than lots of other systems for regulating banking and pensions that have been tried.",1452498119

It dictates that applications should do <i>exactly</i> what you tell them to. For example, using the `install` subcommand of a package manager should not update your packages, but rather that should only be done by the `update` subcommand. Of course you could put in an `if` statement that checks if the package is already installed, and instead it will update it for you. (Not the best example but bear with me) The problem with this is that it breaks expectations; no longer do flags/commands do exactly what the name says, but each will have their own side effects; subtree of commands that are called that you might have to figure out. (Or maybe not if it is well-documented, like how `git pull` calls `git fetch` and then `git merge`) This is antithetical to scripting purposes and completely controlling your own experience. Instead you have to work around the well-meaning one size fits all experience proffered by the developer. Unix tools hate state because commands are meant to be chained together anew each time. They also hate interactive sessions for that reason since it forces people to walk through repetitive steps even when they might already know what they want. What else can you do at that point but offer configuration options? Maybe a possible solution comes from git again: architect your application as a low-level API and include a higher-level implementation. This worked out beautifully in my opinion, with anyone needing to dig into the internals using the plumbing, and the majority of the end users, the porcelain. This comes with its own drawbacks such as the oft-complaint that git uses leaky abstractions and its not always clear how a command modifies the internal state, as well as inconsistent flags. (Note: this is coming from someone who read &quot;Do one thing and do it well&quot; and made it his mantra, not realizing that only robots want to do one thing at a time as in an assembly line; the rest of us want a complete experience)",1452495935

I am grateful for that thankless service. But this isn&#x27;t linkbait. and another post you edited wasn&#x27;t either. And it&#x27;s REALLY annoying because in both cases it totally changed the meaning.<p>here is what I would suggest:<p>1) make it clear in the guidelines what linkbait is. I think that is not established.<p>2) make it clear when a title has been edited in the UI<p>3) when a title differs from it&#x27;s original, cite the original, and explain the reason for the change.<p>4) only change it if you can really do a better job than the original title; or if someone else suggests something better.

Today, the online advertising market is about 25B of which 16B is direct response and the remainder is display (loosely speaking). Facebook may not win a larger share of direct response dollars, but they may enable branding dollars to move online.<p>Many are calling for the shift of offline brand dollars to move online. In the offline world, display advertising is much, much larger than direct response. The TV ad market is $70B alone annually, not counting radio, print and so on.<p>Because of its scale, Facebook can present a one-stop shop to many advertising agencies looking to shift spend from previously mass market TV to new media. Should this happen, a potentially equally large chunk of ad dollars may end up in Facebook's coffers because like Yahoo, Facebook can provide the following<p>(1) A huge audience: largest photo & gaming, and 2nd largest video site on the web with the most amount of minutes of any website\n(2) A gargantuan amount of consistently high quality ad inventory (16% of all display inventory according to eMarketer)\n(3) Best in class user targeting and demographic understanding\n(4) Multiplatform (gaming, photos, etc) and multi-environment (web, mobile, off-Facebook web) targeting\n(5) Consistent reporting across all these media<p>The other significant revenue driver that no one has discussed is Facebook's enormous local ad opportunity - analyzed here: <a href=""http://expostfacto.posterous.com/facebooks-local-ad-opportunity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://expostfacto.posterous.com/facebooks-local-ad-opportun...</a> The local ad market is 133B according to eMarketer (<a href=""http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1007939"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1007939</a>)<p>Facebook quadrupled (<a href=""http://gigaom.com/2010/06/02/facebook-advertisers-have-quadrupled-since-2009/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2010/06/02/facebook-advertisers-have-quadr...</a>) the number of advertisers on their platform last year, my guess is entirely due to SMBs moving to the platform. With the the rise of GroupOn (the fastest growing business in the world according to Fortune), the addressability of SMBs and their enormous advertising spend moving online, Facebook's 150MM mobile users coupled to great demographic data might very well be another huge pot of gold.<p>If Facebook can capture even 5-10% of either market, they would be generating between $6-10B annually at a huge CAGR which you could argue the public markets might value at crazy P/E ratios, maybe even the 95+ of the Chinese exchanges, in which case, Facebook's market cap may approach or pass Google's.",1285307803

1722836,comment,1722614,1722614,0,0,moonpolysoft,,,"This article comes to an incorrect conclusion on the need for timeouts in Erlang's gen:call implementation.  Monitors are necessary but not sufficient for building a robust distributed system with Erlang.<p>When dealing with remote processes a monitor is very quick to detect a process crash, however it can take a lot longer than 5 seconds to detect a node crash or other form of netsplit.  Setting an application specific timeout in this case can be a prudent strategy for setting up a firebreak so that a netsplit does not cause cascading failures through the whole distributed system.<p>A case can also be made that just using monitors is not sufficient when talking with local processes.  Monitors do not detect those situations when a process becomes unresponsive due to overloads like queue overrun.  Once again it is a good idea to have a timeout in the call so that one may avoid a single misbehaving process crashing the whole system.<p>In fact, I find it difficult to imagine a situation where one would not want to have a timeout on a gen:call.  That is why timeouts are set by default in the gen call facilities.  Building highly concurrent systems is difficult.  Erlang makes a lot of the typical pain points in building these systems go away.  But the need to tune defaults and stress test a system remains.",1285307002

The recession is lending to their undeterrement, as for some it looks to be the only hope of an exit from the realities of the recession. The problem is, if education does implode and their efforts are in vein then they now become saddled with debt that is binding even after recourse like a chapter 7 bankruptcy. Educational debt is one of the few that in most cases cannot be discharged in a bankruptcy.<p>Therefore, these individuals may be making worse decisions out of desperation that could have lasting ramifications on their earning potential.<p>I made the same rash decision during the .com crash, figuring a degree would set me in front of other candidates even though by that time I had over 8 years in the industry. Jobs where hard to come by and any possibility of gaining control of the situation was magnified by the magnitude of the situation. The rest of America is now going through that same reality and I am sure many are applying the same faulty thinking.<p>I ended up 40k in the hole for an education that provided no value with respects to providing me a competitive advantage in the job market. Fortunately for me it has had no ill effect either so it is pretty much a wash but for others it may not be the same. If they are already on the brink and earning a degree does not deliver them, then they now have debt that they cannot free themselves from thereby putting themselves in a worse position than they started from.",1285306790

So I remind myself to try simplifying the problem. Often by dropping a layer of flexibility the problem is a lot easier to solve. If I really need the flexibility, I can add it later when I have greater understanding.<p>- Take a Break: sometimes I’m just trying too hard, and need to step back. I work from home, so a short walk outside is a welcome break. Actually getting away from the computer relaxes the grey matter. The vitamin D doesn’t hurt either.<p>- Explain the Problem: very often I find that while I’m explaining the problem, I see it in a different way. If not, the input of another person usually throws a different perspective on the issue. If there’s nobody to bother immediately, just writing down an explanation can help.<p>- Switch Gears: this works when I’m getting frustrated by a lack of progress. By switching to a small, unrelated task, I can Get Something Done and develop some new momentum. This also serves as a break from the original problem.<p>- Write Some Tests: I don’t practice TDD all the time, but when I’m stuck trying to understand how things work, writing some tests first can be very illuminating. Having tests in place also gives gratifying feedback as I finally start to crack the underlying problem. I find this works best for really tough technical issues, where good test coverage is even more important than normal.<p>- Write Some Code: if I have a partial solution, even if I know it is ugly or inadequate, sometimes I’ll just plow ahead anyway.

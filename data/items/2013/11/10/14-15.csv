Istanbul - cheap, hacker friendly, kiloton of culture, but need to manage/like a bit asian way of life. Best food. \n3. London - great startup stuff (services and top people), high costs but high revenues also. So great if you want to earn a lot, not sepend a little.\n4. Dublin - low taxes, good startup stuff, all US IT is there (but maybe already working for Google etc), moderate costs, no language problem<p>- Northern countries (Scandinavia, Baltics): good/moderate startup activities (ask me, I&#x27;m from there), high costs and also revenues (except Baltics which is vice versa), low corruption, e-services (eg. Estonia: open company in 15 min online).  Can manage in English mostly (less in Baltics but still). My key problem: long winter<p>- East Europe: low costs and revenues, high corruption (paperwork/tax pain), problems with English except in small startup enclaves, need local friends (especially bigger countries like Poland, Czech Rep, Romania). If you can cope with this a bit Asian/Russian lifestyle, I&#x27;d skip it and go to Istanbul already, you&#x27;d have not only pain but also gain of this mess.<p>- South-West Europe - each country is quite different, but generally medium costs and revenues, need to know local language or friend (spanish, italian, french, greek), ton of culture which tends to bring also bureaucracy (expect months to your paper processing) , high living quality.",1384094998

But merely having scientific evidence is not an implication of value.<p>If something seems to work, it seems to work. If that something also gets scientifically verified at some point it might turn out to have additional value, too. But it still works if it happened to worked before that.<p>Of all the information verified in hard sciences only a part is practically valuable in running societies, governments, states, and efforts involving humans. The minimum wage of fast food workers is a problem that has no scientific answer and which is also probably quite hard to approach scientifically in the first place. I suppose that the majority of question in a human society are like that.<p>An inflated appreciation towards scientifically verified information tends to overlook everything else that isn&#x27;t scientifically verified. Yet all those things lacking scientific verification are things among which new theories are discovered and some of those do eventually become proven and verified.<p>Yet ultimately, there are no truths, just opinions. Some opinions are individual opinions and may not be shared by many. Some opinions are reasonably based on evidence from various scientific experiments and some of that evidence is so solid that it would be hard to <i>convince</i> most of individuals in our culture otherwise. The physical theories involving air travel are accepted and tested by millions of people every day: they&#x27;re effectively betting their lives against the theories explaining flight being correct. So the opinions are shared by many if not most people and they practically become something we consider a truth. Yet what happens is not that it becomes more true or a more absolute truth: what happens is that you <i>convince</i> more people  and often for a good reason, but objectively that&#x27;s what can be seen happening.

You should be able to do this without spending more than a few minutes on each one.<p>Create a template once and then personalise it as needed. In my current startup, we&#x27;ve emailed many hundreds of people over the past four weeks. It doesn&#x27;t have to take a lot of time. It absolutely can be done without being such a chore to eat too much into your other time. Also, if you cannot do three a day then do two or even one. Or even one every two days. Anything is better than none a day.<p><i>I feel like I&#x27;m better suited for <..snip..> a startup, but I&#x27;m afraid of risking a safe / prestigious job ...</i><p>Unfortunately, in my opinion, startup and risk aversion do not mix well. Startups are risky - that&#x27;s simply the reality of it. If you are risk averse, then startups absolutely are not for you.<p>Founding a startup is a hell of a lot of risk (its still worth it IMHO though) and being one of the first few employees, while not quite as risky, is still a lot of risk because you don&#x27;t know if your job will still be there in a few months or a year.<p>Personally, I think the startup experience is worth it. I can&#x27;t see myself working anywhere else now. But its definitely not for everyone, so consider it carefully.<p>---<p>Having said that, you can absolutely get into software development, but if you want to have lots of options you will want to build a network here too. Life is all about networking. I don&#x27;t think its quite as drastic as having to email three people a day though - I&#x27;d start by attending lots of programming user group meetups and conferences - that&#x27;s where a large portion of my network came from.<p>I know people who have never studied at all who are doing great - the key to their success is that they have good strong github profiles: you will have a degree from a good school, if you can also create a portfolio of projects (personal or open source) then you will be in a really good place. Its not necessary, but its very helpful. If you can get a summer internship, that also helps a lot.

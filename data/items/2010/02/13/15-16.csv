1123116,comment,1122976,1123080,0,0,shabda,,,"> PayPal's issue with Indian accounts was due to your local banking regulations.<p>As I said,<p>1. Paypal support said it is technical, not a regulatory issue. Their blog only confirms it only personal transfers being a regulatory issue. They have stopped all transactions, including my business account, which accepted no personal transaction.<p>2. In spite of their saying otherwise I am willing to believe it is a regulatory issue, my major issue is with their absolute lack of transparency and willingness to commit too any timeline.<p>> The lesson you should take away has to be that you shouldn't treat a payment processor like a bank and hold $45,000 there. Doing business is in part about assessing risk, and holding all your money in a PayPal account should've jumped out as a major risk even without this situation.<p>1. Totally agree that I failed in accessing risk, however Paypal is classified as bank in a number of jurisdictions. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal#Bank_status"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal#Bank_status</a> . I hope you would agree that this behavior should be enough grounds t revoke their bank status?<p>2. Its not all my money, though quite a significant percentage of it. However, I am assuming that there a quite a number of people in India whose weekly transaction is > 45K$, so holding that in a Paypal account is not really unheard of.",1266076737

The Zen of the argument Jeff Atwood presents is appealing for some reason. However, reading such articles now I cannot help but think they contain too little substance.<p>As I understand the reasoning it is this: I'm a relatively good programmer and yet I'm incompetent => The world is full of bad programmers => Most software is badly written => I hate software. Perhaps that currently holds. However, to imply that it will <i>always</i> hold is intellectually crippling. To demonstrate this, all we need to do is look at our premise (axiom?) and rephrase it slightly: ""Any good programmer is still incompetent"". I personally don't see any reason why this should be self-evident and every reason to find ways to change it.",1266076703

1123110,comment,1121775,1122249,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"There are times when someone else is making e.g. the design decisions, the schedule decisions, etc.  Let's take schedule:  They want to know when I'll be done with something.  But I have 5, 8, however many dependencies, half of whom are not responding to my queries for information and several of whom are outside of my team and immediate reporting structure.<p>What do I need?  Responses so that I can determine my own schedule.  What do I get?  ""Just tell me when you'll be done.""<p>Well, Mr/Ms project manager, what do you really need to be doing?  Getting answers from the dependencies who are refusing to answer me.  But that's difficult and frustrating and time consuming.  So you just lean on me, because I'm on your team and at hand.<p>More frustrating than schedules are specifications.  I'll do some QA work.  In order to have some idea of the effort, I need to know the specifications.  But those are still in (major) flux (despite being 2/3 of the way through the budgeted schedule).  I attempt to explain this.  I start describing detail because the person I'm talking to has no idea of the scope of impact this lack of definition creates, or perhaps even that there is still a lack of definition and what that is.  But they just want a date, and/or a number of hours.<p>I'm delving into detail because they haven't done their job.  But they don't want to understand the impact of their lapse.  They just want ""the solution"".<p>Not that I don't make mistakes, myself, and sometimes fail to deliver.  But I try not to blow people off because they are finding what they are tackling to be complex.<p>I guess my comment has ended up being very work focused.  Similar things happen in personal life.  I started to describe an example, but I think I've written enough.",1266076595

Automation is the means by which high-skill workers apply their productivity multipliers to what would otherwise be low-skill work.<p>The technology already exists to automate large swathes of low-skill work; the only reason it's not already done is that, for the most part, low-skill workers are still cheaper, mostly due to the implicit coercion of things like ""needing money to buy food"".<p>What happens when technology progresses to the point where robots are cheaper than paying someone minimum wage is a tricky question--and it's going to happen, probably in Japan first (thanks to both a high level of technological sophistication and an aversion to cheap immigrant labor).",1266076128

1123087,comment,1122651,1122651,0,0,camccann,,,"I recall seeing at some point, but alas cannot recall where, a study that looked at average productivity per hour vs. hours worked each day/week. If memory serves me, they found that productivity/hr reliably dropped at the beginning and end of the work day, mostly independent of how many hours were worked, and also dropped steadily with increasing hours per week beyond some threshold, up to a (surprisingly low) point where the marginal productivity of an additional hour was actually negative.<p>The end result basically said that 4-hr workdays are less than half as productive as 8-hr workdays, and that diminishing returns make long work weeks quickly useless. Interestingly, per hour productivity peaked fairly low--something like 30hrs/week, I think. So, all else equal, if you're paying people hourly, you get best value for money having more people, working fewer hours in fewer days.<p>On the other hand, if you're paying people a salary, you technically always get more value up to the point of burnout (i.e., negative marginal productivity), but for whatever work week length, you get best value for money having people work a few very long days. That is, 12hr days M-R would be more productive than 8hr days M-S.<p>Unfortunately, I've been unable to find the study in question again; so take the above with a grain of salt, as my memory is certainly fallible.",1266075306

Many small tickets, in other words, rather than few big ones. I sell virtual goods and services, nothing tangible. Over the course of the ten years, there have been over 100 held payments, reversals, and chargebacks. PayPal has won a significant number of those chargebacks and recovered the funds for me.<p>The situation you described of having an account closed due to fraud problems, funds held for 180 days, and no help during that time is the same experience they'd have with a merchant account anywhere else. The policies are exactly the same, because they trickle down from the card associations themselves -- more than 1% chargeback rate, or a categorization as a high risk business due to what's being sold, and the MAP is bound to close the account and hold payments for 6 months or their own ability to process credit cards becomes at risk with Visa and MasterCard.<p>I've actually gone through that with a normal merchant account underwritten by a bank.

All of the alternatives suffer from one or more or all of these problems:<p>* Only support for USA.<p>* Supports countries outside USA too, but not enough.<p>* Does not support enough payment methods. Supporting only credit cards is not acceptable, plenty of people don't have credit cards.<p>* Not convenient enough or too confusing for customers. For example, requiring registration is a big no-no. People don't want to register, they just want to buy my product. Even credit card validation - where the customer has to wait a few days for the credit card to be verified - is too much of a hassle.<p>* Too expensive for the customer.

This was very easy to do; Google Reader encourages it at various places.<p>When I logged into GMail and got the ""Buzz"" welcome screen, it offered ""Try Buzz"" and ""No thanks.""  I clicked ""No thanks"" and it took me to GMail, but the Buzz UI was enabled anyways.  When I logged into second account that was a contact of the first, it received a notification that the first account was following the second, with a link to the first account's profile and list of followees/followers.<p>Now, this part is a bit foreign to many people, but imagine that the fact you email someone is a secret and potentially damaging to you.  Maybe you are a whistleblower talking to a government regulator.  Someone I know had a stalker added to their Buzz followers along with people she didn't want the stalker to learn about (because stalkers will try to get at their victims through their friends and family).  Maybe you don't want certain people aware of your sexual orientation, or your religious or political activities.<p>At this point, the damage is already done.  Before Thursday night, there was no clear notification or way to opt-out of the public followers list until after it had been created and then broadcast to a list of people.  By the time you got around to checking out Buzz, realizing that your information had been disclosed, and figuring out how to remove it, it could easily be too late.  Note that Google did not ""suggest"" people to follow and then let users ""accept"" these defaults.  They were added without the user's knowledge or consent.<p>Worse, if you found the ""Turn off Buzz"" link in the GMail footer and clicked it before blocking your followers, changing your profile settings, etc., then all your information is <i>still public</i> but hidden from your GMail pages!  It's then much harder either to discover the problem or to fix it.<p>And Google has admitted to some outright bugs that made the situation worse for the ""Fuck you Google"" blogger.  For example, people still appeared in the ""Following you"" list on Google Reader even after they were blocked and you set your Reader shared items to private; they couldn't actually see your shared items then but it appeared to the user that they could.  Also, before Thursday there was no way to block a user who did not have a public profile.<p>My friends who work at Google are convinced these are real problems[1].

That being say, no, I would not use this to teach SQL nor would I recommend it to people learning SQL. And it's not because I think you have a bad product; it's due to the fact that Excel is a spreadsheet management tool, not a database.<p>I applaud your looking for innovative ways to market your product but this has the potential to do harm to someone's career IMO. I can only imagine a job interviewer's response when someone says they learned SQL using Excel. Excel is not a database and, if you were to try to teach people SQL using a non-database product, I think you are doing them a disservice. Same goes for Google Spreadsheets or any other spreadsheet product. They aren't databases and should not be confused with a real database. IMO ""learning SQL"" is not the same thing as ""learning how to write queries"" yet that is what you imply with this tool/question. I think the SQL community across all platforms would not support it for these reasons.<p>Excel is a great way to learn what a column is and what a row is but it's a horrible tool to learn what a table is, why you need a primary key, what foreign keys are and do, or about the various data types. You cannot learn SQL if you ignore those elements and Excel just does not do those well. Even something as small as MS Access would be a massive improvement over Excel. You don't need an RDBMS for SQL but you do need a DBMS that checks types and does PKs/FKs or what's the point?<p>My background: I teach SQL Server for my company, <a href=""http://www.learnitfirst.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learnitfirst.com/</a>, and have been teaching SQL since the '90s.

There wasn't a good tethering option.\nThe fleet are all in downtown Mountain View (a place flooded with varying WiFi signals.  This problem is compounded by having dozens to hundreds of devices in close proximity to each other.\nWe found that the devices would not hold a reliable persistent connection which would cause intermittent Talos test failures.  Each of these failures could potentially waste a person's time to go deal with it which in turn wastes money.  Hence they came up with the Faraday cage.<p>Please note this is just the story as I understand it from taking a tour of the room.

1123062,comment,1122976,1123018,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I am curious to what you sell and what the average sale price is? Also, what is your daily volume? From what I have seen the people who experience the most issues are the ones who do high volumes daily, ones that sell virtual products, and individuals who have lower credit scores (I know this because I have read some of the forums).  The other thing I have found is that people who never have problems or very limited problems get faster/better customer service. The people that have multiple issues or recurring issues get thrown into this chain of unanswered emails, etc...  PayPal also does not seem to treat people who sell virtual goods the same as they treat people who sell physical ones. Chargebacks are all but impossible to reverse on a virtual good with PayPal. Additionally, if you are doing large volumes, PayPal will ask for additional documentation to support your business, but at the same time lock your funds/account until they receive this documentation. That's fine if they asked up front, but the problem stems when they do it randomly while your site is active and essentially cut off your business.<p>While there are several thousand success stories like yours, there are several thousand fail stories like this guys. I agree that PayPal wouldn't be around if their failures were greater than their successes. The issue is that when they fail they tend to fail in a big way which affects businesses and individuals greatly. If you read the stories, they all have the same underlying theme. PayPal selects account for review (random process no problems on the account before hand), requests additional documentation, freezes funds/ability to receive funds while conducting this review, wait several days, and finally PayPal responds back sorry we find you are a high fraud rate (or other similar reasoning), account closed, wait 180 days (6 months) to receive any money in your account. During this period it appears PayPal does not bother to respond to you via email or phone and when they do you get a mixed answer.<p>If this ever happened to me I would be a little pissed as well. I have had a PayPal account for over 8 years myself and have never had a problem. I send and receive money just fine all the time. I did have a customer several years ago that this happened to though. While we were waiting on PayPal to respond, I did some digging and that is when I started seeing the same story over and over again.<p>My customer sold computer equipment, he was doing large volumes of over $2000 or $3000 a day. Never had a complaint, chargeback, reversal, etc... Receives an email one night at around 3am EST stating that the volume on his account had triggered a fraud alert in PayPal fraud division. They immediately froze all funds in his account (luckily it was only like $5000, as he always made a point to transfer funds out each day or two) and stopped his ability to send/receive. The requested all kinds of additional documentation (shipping files, incorporation paperwork, tax returns). He faxed it all over within 1 day of receiving the notice. They responded that they would get back to him within 5 business days. In the meantime he still could not send/receive or withdraw funds. At the end of day 3 he received an email from them that stated their fraud department had determined his risk was too high and that his account would be closed. His money would be transferred in 180 days to his bank account on record. He tried calling, got a very nice guy on the phone who tried to help him, but still to no avail. It was like once it was stuck in ""fraud review"" it was destined to be closed. Again, no chargeback, reversal, refund, etc... started this, simply a random fraud review. Long story short he involved his attorney, attorney wrote a little letter to PayPal, sent certified mail, and within 3 days of them signing the letter, his money miraculously appeared in his bank account.<p>Anyway, sorry for my rambling. I agree with you that PayPal provides a wonderful service, and anytime I have ever had a problem it was resolved quickly and efficiently. But I have seen the other side of the coin as well and it appears that there is one department within PayPal (fraud/complaince) that appears to run afoul of the rest of the company and thus generate a large number of complaints.",1266073333

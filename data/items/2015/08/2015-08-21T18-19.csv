10099552,comment,10097085,10099136,0,0,fredrivett,,,"Hey eonw & pki. Great questions!<p>For us we had a few options when looking at creating FoundersKit. There are a few really important factors in our decision.<p>1) We didn&#x27;t want to be just another deals site that has any company offering a deal. We wanted to keep a really high level of curation so our members can know that the tools listed are high quality. Deal sites that include any company offering a discount end up causing work for the user to try and dissect which tools & services are any good.
2) By charging a small fee for a years access to all the deals (including those added after becoming a member) we can get a much better deal from our partners that other open deal sites cannot get. Companies aren&#x27;t willing to give out lifetime discounts in the public but quite a few of our partners have offered discounts like this and lots of others have offered discounts above and beyond those circulated elsewhere. Literally 15 minutes ago I just got confirmation of another great tool (one I intend to use myself soon) that will be joining FoundersKit and offering a 25% off lifetime discount. These are the sort of deals we&#x27;re looking for.
3) This method means our partners know that the customers using the discount codes are high quality and not just looking for a free ride. At the very least it shows that they&#x27;re willing to pay when they see something they want (which not all customers are).<p>Ultimately our vision is to make a Founders life easier. To collect all the best tools & services in one place, with great discounts & savings to try them out. Forgetting the unique discounts we offer, we think the time & effort this bundle saves Founders is worth the money.<p>Really appreciate your feedback on this though, if you have any other thoughts please don&#x27;t hesitate to let me know!",1440183584

(2)Assuming conclusion and using that to open up discussion is a fairly standard rhetorical practice. Are you saying that that paragraph doesn&#x27;t move the discussion forward? Why is it unfair?

Mischaracterization isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m trying to do malignantly: but unless I&#x27;m missing something recent posts have been very much in the vein of &quot;here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like&quot; rather than &quot;here&#x27;s how we are fixing some thing we don&#x27;t like&quot;.

What&#x27;s with all the change?</i><p>Git does something very well: it has great support for rewriting version histories.  It nearly flawlessly supports almost every conceivable scenario of slicing, dicing, mixing and combining.<p>It also has great support for working at the sub-file granularity. For instance, this morning I moved a fix from an experimental branch to stable. The fix was part of a huge commit, and consisted of just a few &quot;hunks&quot; out of many in one file. It was obvious that the particular fix, though needed by the experimental changes, could be promoted to stable (it was a change of the kind where some code is altered in such a way that it no longer interacts with the experimental changes, and is improved at the same time.)  With git I easily rewrote that big commit such that just those specific changes in the specific file were removed from that commit. This was done without touching anything in the working copy not so much as altering any modification timestamp! (&quot;make&quot; didn&#x27;t even see that anything needed to be rebuilt after the commit rewrite.) In git we can do &quot;keep my working copy as it is, but alter the history behind it, so those alterations then appear as staged, uncommitted changes&quot;.  Then we can easily migrate the changes somewhere, like turning it into its own commit, perhaps on another branch. After I migrated those changes to master, I then went back to that branch and did a &quot;git rebase&quot;. Lo and behold, that branch picked up the changes, and now it looks as if those changes were written on master all along, before the experimental changes were developed.<p>Programmers need this kind of thing because we are obsessed about making the perfect set of changes. Since the history of a code base is a digital artifact, we want to be able to hack that artifact to perfection too, not just the instantaneous/current view of the code itself.<p>Git is also like an adventure game in which you solve quests and acquire higher and higher status. This creates allure. The Novice Adventurer cannot understand all the reasons why the Grandmaster Wizards of GCC have switched to Git, but is mystified and fascinated.",1440182874

A bonus of this setup is that it forces you to separate your data source from your view, doing sorts and filters and whatnot independent of the table view. It keeps things neat and clean.<p>I’m not a web guy but most sorting table implementations on the web I’ve seen do the opposite, instead treating the table contents as the data to be manipulated. While this works it’ll cause you trouble in the long run and if nothing else will negatively impact performance. With the cell reuse model, you instead perform your transformations on the original data (free of markup gunk) and ask the table view to update itself to match the data source. Under iOS, this is done through UITableView’s reloadData method. You never directly interact with the table view’s recycling functions.",1440182870

I&#x27;d argue that just as important, however, is the access to other advanced students that comes along with it.<p>TL;DR for the below brain dump: when your peer group values low achievement as its own form of achievement, it takes a lot of lucky breaks and facepalm worthy epiphanies to right the ship.<p>PS: having now written the below, I realize the entire thing sort of hinges on whether I am actually smart and a reader has no reason to assume that is the case. I&#x27;m leery of looking like a narcissistic humblebragger but at the same time need to justify including myself in the group &quot;smart people.&quot; My &quot;I&#x27;m pretty smart&quot; creds: pre-personal dark age, I won my middle school geography bee and did decently at the state-level competition; post-personal dark age I scored a 1600 on the GRE. I&#x27;m loathe to mention either and never do IRL because they were both kinda gimmes I was born into vs achievements earned via hard work but I think here they provide useful context.<p>The anecdote proper:<p>Growing up, I was in gifted classes through 7th grade. Life got hard in the way it does for kids that age though and, with my grades slipping, I was moved into normal classes.<p>As a smart kid taking standard difficulty classes, one is very much exposed to the anti-intellectualism that is so popular in America currently. If getting picked on for being a dweeb in the half of the day i wasn&#x27;t in the advanced classes wasn&#x27;t optimal, moving out of them completely was markedly less so. Some people adapt and overcome. Personally, I internalized the bullying and negative feedback, adopted an &quot;if you can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em, join &#x27;em&quot; philosophy and proceeded to waste years trying to impress the wrong people with how normal and cool I could be. I graduated in the bottom quartile of my class, one F shy of spending a fifth year in high school.<p>On the strength of an oddly incongruent SAT score and a letter of recommendation that I would give my right hand to read, I still managed a very good scholarship to an out of state public school. Even with this opportunity dropped into my lap, I had to be talked/coerced(!) into taking the scholarship. I just did. not. get. it. AT ALL.<p>I went to college because my parents were going to start charging me rent and I more or less thought I&#x27;d party for a while and then drop out and &quot;join the Marines or something.&quot; My first semester I found a new group of bros just like the ones from high school and <i>earned</i> a 1.7 GPA.<p>Something else happened that semester though. When I did manage to make it to my lectures, I really enjoyed them. I&#x27;d skip tests and not do classwork but I&#x27;d read and listen to lectures diligently. There was one specific class called &quot;Primates, People and Prehistory&quot; that particularly blew my mind. If curiosity is a pilot light, that course was the spark that reignited it.<p>I came back that Spring ready to work, just missed a 4.0 (damn you, B+ in Português!) and managed to bring my grades up above a 3.0 to keep my scholarship. I spent several more years gradually learning to be okay with the fact that I enjoyed learning. I still hid it behind an &quot;aww shucks, I&#x27;m just here to party&quot; veneer but every semester I drifted further from my friends, had more excuses to bail on them and read until we were entirely different people. I still care about them and keep in touch, but I&#x27;m definitely the &quot;weird one&quot; now.<p>Were it not for a ridiculous letter of recommendation, or that long shot scholarship, or the awakening to the broader world of learning that first semester, my life would be entirely different. I had a huge &quot;working hard and caring is for suckers&quot; chip on my shoulder in high school and I think wherever I&#x27;d ended up, I&#x27;d still be sneering at the try hards and glorying in how I could have done just the same if I&#x27;d wanted to. It&#x27;s taken years to recover from that detour and get my head right about who I am.<p>I&#x27;d like to think that if I&#x27;d stayed on the track most of my middle school peers were on, if I&#x27;d stayed surrounded by people who gave a damn, my detour into doubt and self-loathing might have been curtailed. As a 29 year old, I feel like it has only been in the past 2-3 years that I&#x27;ve shifted out of neutral and really earnestly started engaging with the world.<p>I&#x27;m wholeheartedly in favor of anything we as a society can do to save other &quot;dumb smart kids&quot; similar heartburn.",1440182844

When discussing funding of gifted programs we should refrain from comparing it to &quot;the other side of the ESE spectrum&quot;, because it is not a give and take from one group to the other, and even if it were it is not an appropriate comparison in terms of overall number of students, and average cost/student for services.

Follow it at your own risk.<p>Make sure you&#x27;re going to bed at the same time every night (notice: that&#x27;s <i>every</i> night. Not just weeknights.), and getting up at the same time every day (ditto), and make sure the delta between those two times is long enough. Not &quot;I feel rested after 30 minutes of sleep&quot; long enough: start with 9 hours and maintain that until you&#x27;re getting up < 30 minutes before your alarm by yourself and feeling rested. At this point, you can more or less consider your sleep debt paid off. Then, back off the duration of sleep in ~90 minute intervals (that&#x27;s the average REM cycle in humans) using the same criteria (note that average time to fall asleep is about 15 minutes). Most people won&#x27;t get past a 7.5 hour sleep time.<p>Another thing that really helped me is cutting most processed sugar and all caffeine. As somebody who had a serious coffee and energy drink addiction, this was really hard to do, but it makes a big difference. If you &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; cut caffeine, then try cutting it after 2pm or so. The biological half life of caffeine is 3-7 hours in adults, so when in doubt, go earlier than 2pm if you can. If you&#x27;re a smoker, quit that too. Generally, stop putting stimulants into your body. Given that most of those stimulants also come with all kinds of sugars and other less-than-desirable additives, you&#x27;ll be more healthy for it in the long run.<p>Along that same line, alcohol, despite being a depressant, is a good thing to avoid, especially in excess around bedtime. It might help you sleep, but long term dependence on alcohol puts you firmly in the &quot;alcoholic&quot; category, and even worse, it can cause or exacerbate insomnia.<p>When you&#x27;re doing all of ^, you shouldn&#x27;t need anything else unless there&#x27;s some kind of disorder in play.

It&#x27;s correctable over time, though, in part by following the rules I put up there ^, and in part by following these next ones (these apply to other sleep phase disorders, including mild insomnia):<p>0) This is optional, but keeping a log of anything related to your body will provide you with useful data down the road should you need it. Treat this like a personal log file: timestamped entries for when/what you ate, what meds you took, when you laid down in bed, when your alarm goes off, when you get out of bed (those times are usually different for me :P ), your rating of your sleep on some consistent scale, and how long you exercise. The more data, the better.<p>1) Start with 6mg of melatonin 15 minutes before laying down in bed. Keep doing that for a week. If you are still having problems falling asleep:<p>2) 6mg of melatonin and 25mg diphenhydramine (Unisom). Note that this is an antihistamine, and that in some cases, they can react poorly with SSRIs (depression medication). I know somebody that ended up sleeping for about 48 hours straight as a result. They&#x27;re otherwise pretty safe. After a week, if you&#x27;re <i>still</i> having problems, and you&#x27;re being honest with yourself about following the rules at the top of this post:<p>3) 6mg melatonin, 50mg diphenhydramine. This is about the most potent OTC sleep cocktail available. After a week and really, <i>really</i> making sure you&#x27;re following the rules at the top - see how I keep coming back to that? They&#x27;re important - if it&#x27;s still not working:<p>4) Go to a doctor armed with the log from step 0 and get a prescription for Trazodone, which can (I&#x27;m told by my doctor) be safely layered on top of the Melatonin and Diphenhydramine. If you stay awake through this, there are other options too. Zolpidem didn&#x27;t do anything for me, but I&#x27;m told it works wonders on other people.<p>In any case, start with the minimum effective dose of these things because they can really mess you up.",1440182024

For any real numbers a < b we can produce an approximation that works well for a ≤ x ≤ b, but it cannot be a good approximation for all real numbers x.

From my experience, Airbnb has only a single upside: you get to stay at someone else&#x27;s place, which has a quite different vibe from a hotel. One the flip-side, compared to a hotel, the prices are considerably higher, you have to negotiate with a host on checkin time (most of the times), and overall you don&#x27;t have any guarantees on the quality of your rental the same way you have with a hotel chain. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but Airbnb has not loyalty/rewards program available either, which could be quite beneficial for frequent travelers.<p>The whole &quot;local experience&quot; seems to be a mere marketing fluff. The Airbnb experience doesn&#x27;t seem to imply much interaction with the host, the same way which it&#x27;s predecessor Couchsurfing did. Once you checked into you Airbnb rental, you are on your own, the same way as if you stayed at a hotel, but with even less hand-holding. Hotels at least provide a (poor) local recommendation service.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what a typical customer of Airbnb looks like.",1440181308
10099306,comment,10093074,10095570,0,0,takinola,,,"You need to separate the commercial value of art from the (for lack of a better word) intrinsic value of art.  The halo effect happens in any field whenever there is a subjective evaluation. For instance, people tend to think expensive wines are better even though they often cannot tell the difference between cheap(er) and more expensive wines in blind tests.<p>I believe the intrinsic value of art (ie. how &quot;art-y&quot; something is) can be evaluated in a couple ways.  First is technical.  Does the execution of the art require some kind of technical excellence.  If you take a look at some paintings and sculptures, you cannot but be struck by the incredible attention to detail and precise work done by the creator.  Even features that the audience would probably never notice (eg. reflections in the pupil of the subject in a painting) are carefully rendered.<p>The second criteria is how much the piece changes the art form itself.  Think about how renaissance paintings introduced perspective in painting to make more realistic images whereas earlier paintings were flat and lifeless.  More recently, consider how Elvis created rock and roll or how Michael Jackson changed the definition of a singer from someone with a good voice and catchy tune to being an all round entertainer with skills in dancing, video and special effects.<p>The third criteria is something I call transference.  It is when an artist can transfer an emotion from inside their mind to that of the audience using only the medium of their art.  Listen to Chopin&#x27;s Funeral March to see what I mean or rewatch the early scenes in Jaws (before the shark shows up) to get a more contemporary example.<p>Lastly, some art has a point of view and says something that asks us to look at the world in a different way.  Most standup comedy is like this.  Banksy&#x27;s art is like this.  Warhol&#x27;s paintings were like this.  Shit on a plate could be like this if executed well.  This is the area where I feel a lot of modern art has lost its way.  They mistake different for meaning.  I once was at the Tate Modern in London and noticed that most people were not really looking at the works of art but fixated on the little white cards next to each piece explaining what the work was about.  If the art work cannot tell its own story then perhaps it has not much to say or is not well done.<p>Art, like love, can only be truly measured in the heart of the subject.  Your feelings for your mum would not be swayed if some celebrity stated that their mother was the best in the world so, unless you are an art investor, do not be carried away by the whims of the so-called connoisseurs of the art establishment.",1440181292

You may want to move this to email (my email is in my profile).<p>> I face backlash from people who see no ethical concerns with proprietary software<p>I think this could be clearer.  RMS himself has stated [0] that selling exceptions is perfectly fine, so even free software zealots do not object to proprietary licensing in all of its forms.  I think most people object to proprietary licensing in some forms.  This is a case where speaking in riddles and platitudes is not effective policy.<p>> or who are apologetic to &quot;open source&quot; instead<p>Again this is a platitude turn of phrase.  I support some kinds of open source and not others, as do I expect most thinking people.  Does that make me &quot;apologetic&quot;?  Am I the problem?  No clue.<p>> Usually it&#x27;s in the form of some smartass who will redefine the word &quot;freedom&quot; to mean something different from the context at hand<p>Quite frankly, one could accuse the entire Free Software movement of this, as that is essentially its purpose: to redefine the loaded term &quot;freedom&quot; in a nonintuitive way.<p>But accepting for the sake of argument the FSF&#x27;s vision of software &quot;freedom&quot; as the correct definition, I am not convinced it is an actual view instead of a post-hoc rationalization.  For example, the FSF claims [1] the RPL is non-free for 3 reasons:<p>1. It puts limits on prices charged for an initial copy.<p>2. It requires notification of the original developer for publication of a modified version.<p>3. It requires publication of any modified version that an organization uses, even privately.<p>Now my question is this: which of the four freedoms, specifically, give rise to these objections?  Because from my POV the RPL not only protects the four freedoms, but does so <i>strongly</i>, for exactly the reasons here that are presented as so-called &quot;objections&quot;.<p>So, the only conclusion that I can draw, is that the 4Fs are a lot of nonsense, a &quot;just-so&quot; story to explain why GPL License is Best License.  Freedom is allowed to go so far, but no further, until GPL v4, and then we can go further.<p>I am sorry if some of this seems trollish or offputting.  I promise it is not.  I have read probably hundreds of books and essays on this and I cannot find anything that satisfies me that &quot;Free Software&quot; is an intellectually defensible philosophy.  This may be because the people who are best-positioned to defend it have better things to do than defend it to me.<p>I want to like the free software community, and we do collaborate, in a sense, but it is always strategic and not ideological.  It just so happens, in cases, the GPL and my objectives are compatible.  But the FSF&#x27;s objectives and my objectives are not really compatible at all.  So there is the same funny taste in my mouth from working at cross-purposes that I get when writing proprietary software.  It has the same artificiality.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/selling-exceptions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/selling-exceptions</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#RPL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#RPL</a>",1440181050

Had to go with what was already proven and more negotiable, though, so that was MIPS.<p>&quot;You never talk about what an &quot;accelerator&quot; is in your case...&quot;<p>I referenced Octeon III as an example.

The low end did 24 GIPS peak and supported Interlaken (10+Gbps) w/ dedicated hardware for compression, crypto, etc.<p>The new models go from 24-48 cores (120-240 GIPS peak), run at 2.4GHz, do 500Gbps max I/O, offer easy integration with application-specific accelerators (500 so far) directly on network-on-chip, and have mature toolchains for Linux & RTOS&#x27;s. So, you could offload compression, search (eg pathfinding), graphics, crypto, physics... whatever... onto engines that handle it at hardware speed/efficiency while letting CPU focus on everything else.<p>&quot;like a &quot;Digital Signal Processor&quot;. Modern computers already have both of those accelerators built-in.

It&#x27;s like a different world compared to regular programming and with no standardization. There were whole companies founded to build tools to solve that problem. OpenCL made nice strides but it&#x27;s still not regular programming. Much easier for dev&#x27;s to program in C/C++, use a good concurrency approach, call a library function (SW or HW accelerated) for specific hotspots, and hit compile.<p>Of course, if you find that very challenging, you can always handcode several models of DSP to save yourself time. ;)",1440180944

Apart from having been in the game since mozilla suite and having experienced a LOT of things that didn&#x27;t turn out so well, to say the least and keep it polite and curse-word free...<p>The WebExtensions API is supposed to be an intentionally strictly defined API with a limited feature set; that just comes with the territory. It is supposed to give you access to a subset of Firefox features/internals. Compare that to the current extension &quot;API&quot;: What Firefox can do, your add-on can do, and a lot of more things as well. You can customize Firefox to the point it really is a new browser (with thinks like Tab Mix Plus, Tree tabs, vimperator/pentadactyl) or just keep it (almost) vanilla, as you please. This is a major plus for users.<p>Sure, for a lot of things the extension team may add a WebExtensions API. But that is limited to what that team deems worthy of their time, deems &quot;useful&quot;, and deems &quot;safe&quot;. It is no longer up to the add-on developer to decide what they would like to develop, but up to the WebExtensions API gatekeeper team on what they want to allow and what they then prioritize and create the actual APIs.
Adding new APIs you may need will require you nag the team about it, though luck if you don&#x27;t speak any language they understand, tough luck if they don&#x27;t care or cannot care because their time is not infinite.<p>What makes me even more pessimistic is seeing the Jetpack/Add-on SDK after years of development and how it still only can address only the most basic use cases. The number of SDK-based add-ons, even relatively simple ones, that have to resort to &#x27;require(&quot;chrome&quot;)&#x27; is staggeringly high. If the pace of the Add-on SDK and the stability its API is any indication... Time to look for another browser... Except there isn&#x27;t any comparable to what Firefox still is right now.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget: A change like this will break almost all existing add-ons in major ways. Many if not add-ons need to be rewritten in their entirety or at least in major chunks from scratch. Many add-ons will simply not make that huge investment in time required for that and simply die, without readily available replacements and leaving users behind scratching their heads.",1440180904

For example, most plausible instantiations of the crime policies suggested above are <i>blatantly unconstitutional</i>.<p>Second, there are plenty of objective arguments in my posts here that any racialized theory of intelligence is not worth to studying, and you&#x27;re ignoring all of them. As one small example, over multiple posts, you and peterfirefly have failed to name one <i>concrete</i> policy option for which an answer to this question is remotely necessary.<p>If anything here is irrational, it is your insistence on studying a correlation that has no value beyond justifying racially motivated policies. If the last 2000 years teach us anything, it&#x27;s that for any concrete social problem you&#x27;d want to solve, a solution motivated by the belief that one race is superior to another is not going to be the optimal solution.<p><i>> pretending that race is some utterly inscrutable field</i><p>Belief in superiority on a collection of phenotypes roughly correlated to what we call &quot;race&quot; today pre-dates Darwin by 100+ years. AS a matter of historical fact, the &quot;scientific&quot; notion of race today came about as a post-facto characterization of latent racial superiority theories that existed prior to the scientific era.<p>So yes, race is inscrutable from a scientific perspective because it is not -- at base -- an idea of scientific origin.<p>Here is what we do know.<p>We know that Every. Single. Time. any society has made a decision motivated by the belief that one race is objectively better than another race, the result was a social order that could not be described with any word other than evil.<p>We know that for hundreds of years, crackpots of varying scientific literacy and persuasiveness have evoked the en vogue scientific ideas of the day to claim the inferiority of a group of people with an astoundingly invariant set of latent racial characterizations. And we know that at every point in history, their crackpottery is eventually identified -- even if science doesn&#x27;t advance enough to demonstrate the crackpottery until years later. (the somewhat pathetic aspect of the crackpottery displayed in this thread that rjkyle is so kindly addressing is that it all has already been disproven, and yet... so don&#x27;t pretend this is about &quot;scientific truth&quot; or &quot;intellectual inquiry&quot;)<p>We know that <i>even if</i> it were reasonable from to outset to choose a given phenotype over all others to study, it would go against the grain of everything we have learned in the last 2000 years to use any notion of inferiority between races as a basis for decision making.<p>We know that <i>even if</i> that characterization had a causal link to intelligence, there are far better and less noisy predictors of intelligence.<p>So, there is no reason to study this correlation. Not today, not yesterday, not tomorrow. Nothing good can come of it. If history is a guide, not even intellectual understanding.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m done engaging with you and peterfirefly now. The belief that one &quot;race&quot; is superior to another is detestable, and to claim that there could exist definitive scientific evidence for such a claim fundamentally misunderstands what science is and ignores a rich history of such claims in the history of science",1440180564

This lets him appear tough and influential in front of his power base, yet without much risk of starting an actual international conflict.<p>Without an outlet where countries can express such dissatisfaction, they would take to launching missiles at each other with greater frequency. The UN&#x27;s existence is largely symbolic (organizations like NATO provide the real firepower), but symbolism and politics go hand in hand.

If you make people do a bunch of paperwork before they start fighting, chances are they will be satisfied with registering a complaint against each other.",1440180009

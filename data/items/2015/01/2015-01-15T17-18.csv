Maybe it depends on your coworkers, you have to trust them not to be too loud or bothersome, and you have to be fine with being in the same room as these people for 8+ hours a day for a long time.<p>At my office, the &quot;Dev Room&quot; has 10 engineers in the same room, as well as open desks for anyone else to join us. The rest of the office has rooms with 1-3 people working in them, but we requested to take this large room. Whenever anyone from the rest of the office walks into the dev room, they always have to remark &quot;Wow, it&#x27;s so silent in here.&quot; And it&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s a different world once you walk in here. We even have our own conference room only accessible through this room.<p>But because everyone here are friends, it&#x27;s easy for us to ask questions, have fun, play around. Right now as I type this, two developers are drawing Chinese characters and playing with the new Google Translate app. The rest of us have headphones on.

8894124,comment,8893593,8893593,0,0,bad_user,,,"I love this trend of building compilers for existing languages that target Javascript. Other 2 languages with fully functional Javascript compilers that are worth checking out:<p>- Scala / Scala.js (<a href=""http://www.scala-js.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scala-js.org/</a>) and I&#x27;m actually using this one for a non-trivial app<p>- Clojure / ClojureScript (<a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript</a>) with some companies using it in production<p>Both are using Google&#x27;s Closure compiler to do tree shaking minification and are emitting source maps for the compiled code, so the size of the compiled artifacts is manageable in spite of the huge standard libraries they come with and debugging works well. Normally if you want tree shaking with Google Closure, you have to write code specific for Google Closure, however these compilers are doing that for you.<p>What you get in comparison with Javascript are saner languages that aren&#x27;t just a prettified Javascript - completely different type system, awesome standard libraries, packages, saner semantics overall; you get a sane dependency management and build process, by means of their build tools (SBT and Leiningen respectively); you get libraries that are cross-compiled for the JVM and Javascript, so you can do code sharing between the server and the browser and you can use mostly the same tools, like IDEs. For example it&#x27;s a great experience to use IntelliJ IDEA for targeting the browser with Scala - you get code completion, refactoring, the works.<p>And yes, the compiled size of the final artifact is a source of worry, but in practice I found to not be an issue and what&#x27;s awesome is that in the long run it actually saves bandwidth for heavy apps. With Javascript many people tend to avoid using third-party libraries, because every imported library adds to the download size, however with tree shaking you&#x27;re paying only for what you use. As I mentioned, being a Scala developer I picked up Scala.js and it&#x27;s completely awesome, in spite of the project being young. Unfortunately these heavier alternatives to Javascript haven&#x27;t picked up popularity - for some reason people preferred putting lipstick on Javascript and pretend that it&#x27;s a new language.<p>I&#x27;m happy that compilers for C# are happening as well. My only gripe is that in true .NET fashion I&#x27;m not seeing a link to the source, which makes me think that this won&#x27;t be open-source. Which is a pity.",1421344718

8894104,comment,8892913,8892913,0,0,gtjay,,,"Having moved to Australia in recent years, I was very happy to see that JayCar, their equivalent to Radio Shack, seemed to be doing quite well. This is judging by what I&#x27;ve seen of the stores in what is considered a fairly backwards part of Australia (Queensland).<p>The difference seems to be two-fold. First, Jaycar didn&#x27;t go through an insane expansion (there are only 12 or so locations per state). Second, they&#x27;ve grown &quot;out&quot; from their core market of electronics hobbyist instead of betraying it. Just a few examples: custom car stereos, solar panel accessories, camping/RV electronics, boating electronics, and DJ-stuff like laser projectors. This is all in addition to the arduino and 3D printing stuff that you&#x27;d expect. There&#x27;s a huge amount of cross-over between these markets, which works out great for Jaycar.<p>There is one additional factor keeping Jaycar healthy that probably shouldn&#x27;t be underplayed. Due to mining and a less crypto-facist view of unions, Australia has not (yet) completely gutted it&#x27;s blue-collar market and culture. Jaycar advertises almost exclusively to this &quot;tradie&quot; (as the Australians call it) demographic. Jaycar is marketed as a &quot;manly&quot; thing, not a &quot;nerd&quot; or &quot;tech&quot; thing. In fact, it&#x27;s even drummed up minor controversy from feminist as being exclusionary with ads focusing on &quot;leaving her to go to your man-cave&quot; and whatnot. This part of Jaycar&#x27;s success probably can&#x27;t be replicated stateside. The market of people who have the skills to fix a small electric outboard motor <i>and</i> can still afford one died with the rest of blue-collar culture and jobs.",1421344560

But maybe we should consider whether your response to this article is itself an illustration of the very phenomenon that leads us to perceive the world as more dangerous as it is. The usual account of why we live in such irrational fear is that nobody wants to hear about things going well, and everyone being safe and happy on the news. Anyone who watches the news, therefore, sees a distilled tale of conflict and woe.<p>But this article is may well be doing the same thing. What have we learned from this article? Two kids, walking down the street, were stopped by police, and a social services investigation was triggered. We get virtually no information about the broader context: does this sport of thing happen often, or was this an anomaly? What will be the outcome of the investigation be?<p>In short, just as the strife you see on the news can make a person think the world is more dangerous than it is, the isolated examples of our culture running off the rails can have the same distorting effect.",1421344346

(The 50 years part of their sign has been up there at least 10 years).<p>They do a surprising amount of business from local engineering firms, AV/network/cable installers, and little IT shops because where else are you going to get a 25 pair Amphenol connector, a quad op-amp, some colored heatshrink tubing, obscure batteries, and a 1% 27.1kohm resistor at 9am on a Saturday? They are expensive compared to online retailers (for small parts), but they carry Arduino and RPi and the cool-kids stuff too at only a small markup.<p>As a kid, the closest electronics shop to me was RadioShack (Radio Shack then) (and it was my favorite place to go). It was right next to where I got my hair cut and in the same shopping center as the grocery store, so I got to go at least every other week. Back then, they had two (maybe three) aisles of electronic components, copper clad PCBs for etching, ferric chloride by the gallon, both 40xx and 74xx series logic in DIP packages; all sorts of stuff. I haven&#x27;t been in an RS for a long time, but last time I was there I couldn&#x27;t even find a barrel connector and they used to have a dozen different sizes. Even in the early 90s I guess RS was an expensive store - a five pack of resisters was $0.50 or a dollar - but ordering on the Internet wasn&#x27;t an option and mail-order was difficult if you didn&#x27;t have a business account.<p>I miss what they used to be, but the state of the hobby has changed - most things center around a microcontroller now (RS never carried any in my recollection, though they did have some EPROMS ... maybe they had an 8051?) and I can do things with a half dozen discrete components and an Arduino in a few hours that would have required twenty or thirty TTL logic chips, wirewrap sockets, and a whole weekend not so very long ago.<p>I wish there existed something like a fusion between the traditional hobbyist electronics store and a modern hackerspace. Some place where I could go to rent time on a 3D printer, CNC machine or reflow oven and also buy the missing parts I need and get advice on whatever I&#x27;m working on.<p>I think the market still exists for walk-in hobby electronics stores, though I grant it&#x27;s not an easy market to survive in. I don&#x27;t have the answers, maybe the folks who own Baynesville do.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.baynesvilleelectronics.com/index2.ivnu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.baynesvilleelectronics.com/index2.ivnu</a>",1421344339

Extra-legal probably isn&#x27;t the exact wording I&#x27;m looking for, but why couldn&#x27;t issues of excessive cruelty to children be handled in the standard manner, with due-process, etc.?  I suppose I only hear about the outliers of extreme overreach, but it seems like CPS attracts busybodies with power complexes.  And there is a potential that there is more of a backstory here that we aren&#x27;t hearing about.  Is there a compelling reason we shouldn&#x27;t we shut these agencies down, or at least greatly curtail their activities?  Or at the very least, fire everyone who was involved in this particular investigation?",1421343619

Very hard. SIP only gets you so far even with web RTC, then you hit issues where server X doesn&#x27;t like delegating authentication to anything else, Y does but requires super-indepth knowledge of the protocol, and Z may or may not but it&#x27;s got so many modules it&#x27;s hard to tell. Then there&#x27;s the issue of needing some degree of call control so connections can be terminated for using too much time, which the hosted SIP services I looked at don&#x27;t seem to allow. And, unfortunately, the hardest problem of the launch list is the one I need to get right, meaning I&#x27;ve spent months looking for a good, low-cost, cross-platform (desktop, Android and IOS) video exchange solution and have only recently found something that may work. It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;ve just used bad Google keywords or something, but none of the legacy SIP servers seem to like being plugged into a web app as opposed to managing everything themselves.<p>So, yeah, definitely not abandoned, I&#x27;ve just spent way more time than I liked finding a possibly good media server, plus continuing to earn money so I can keep the lights on and pay the rent. :) Hoping for a launch in the next couple months, assuming my current path pays off.<p>BTW, how the hell do you accessibly (I.e. via the keyboard) click the button to submit comments here? :P I have to poke around on my touchscreen until I find it, then double-tap.

Your overhead as an independent includes additional employment taxes, retirement contributions, hardware, software, utilities, and space. In addition, you are taking on risk that is built in to your company-provided salary.<p>I believe you should strive for 100% above your salary. If you make $100K, your goal should be $200/hour, especially if the engagements are small/ side work. You probably should not settle for less than 50% above, as you are setting a rate that you will use if your side work becomes full-time (which it very well may).<p>Don&#x27;t undervalue yourself. And don&#x27;t count on going in at a low rate and raising it later.

Cops would show up, talk to us, then leave once they knew we weren&#x27;t making trouble and were safe. Never followed up on us or our parents. The only scary situation is once we were playing paintball and someone said a bunch of kids with guns are running around, cops showed up, searched us then went home laughing.<p>I think the difference today is all related to liability and the helicopter culture it created. Maybe the cops are just CYAing themselves by involving CPS. Maybe the cops didn&#x27;t like the parents attitude and involved CPS. There is a huge stigma today about being up your kids ass and if you&#x27;re not, you&#x27;re a bad parent.

But call-center workers are basically the same as production-line workers, they&#x27;re measured in calls-per-hour in the way a worker at a car factory is measured in body panels mounted per hour.<p>There&#x27;s been a very long road in management science, a road that&#x27;s still being walked, where each step along the way, the field comes to the realization that knowledge workers are not in fact the same as production-line workers. You can&#x27;t measure a software developer&#x27;s productivity in KLoCs/unit time, and you can&#x27;t make development go faster by throwing more people at it.

8893806,comment,8893554,8893554,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I remembered a website with a visual illustration of how much the walking range of children has declined in Britain during four generations of a family living in the same town. The map, based on where the great-grandfather, grandfather, mother, and son in the same family walked, shows a stark narrowing in how far children walk on their own.[1] In my town, in Minnesota in the United States, I walked regularly on the city trail system with my children to the county library branch (about a mile away, in one direction from our home) or to the shopping district (about a mile away in the other direction on our same city trail system). All of my children have been able to do those walks on their own, or with an older sibling accompanying a younger sibling, for a long time. My children can be out and about in our neighborhood without anyone hassling them. It should be that way for more children. Most cities in the United States these days are objectively safe enough for children to walk outdoors alone at the ages described in the article kindly submitted here (I don&#x27;t know specifically about that part of greater DC in suburban Maryland,[2] but I would guess it is safe enough too), and children are better off walking and exploring more rather than being confined indoors or in cars on parental drives to other buildings all day.<p>AFTER EDIT: Many comments posted after mine here was posted are bemoaning the lack of freedom children have to roam outside today, but that remains to be proven. I think the most astute comments here point out that we really don&#x27;t know whether there are a lot of external pressures on parents to keep their children from walking outside alone, or just a change in parenting practices that makes that less common. I can testify that here in Minnesota, my children are far from the only children who walk outside by themselves at the ages reported in the news anecdote here. Compared to my childhood growing up not far from where I live now, I think children spend too much time indoors in general, and not enough time outside, but I have no fear of the police or the child protection authorities here when my children are outside. We are homeschoolers, so my children have spent a lot of time outdoors during normal school hours. That has never been a problem here, as everyone knows that homeschooling is legal in Minnesota. My children have often walked to the public library by themselves during school hours. New parents (some of the commenters on this thread) need not be afraid of bringing up their children to take walks by themselves outdoors.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/571-the-great-indoors-or-childhoods-end"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/571-the-great-indoors-or-ch...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Woodside+Park,+Silver+Spring,+MD+20910/@39.0064983,-77.0302548,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89b7c8b4e374455b:0xa022de7872e035fd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Woodside+Park,+Silver+Spri...</a>",1421342509

- Shared context. With conversations happening in the open, others will often overhear, sometimes learn, and often will choose to participate.
- Impromptu socialization leads to better morale. Someone drops by to chat socially, others join in, people build personal relationships.
- Function-specific spaces. The space saved by having a denser desk layout is allocated to having everything from kitchens to massage chair rooms to ping-pong tables.

I think it might be the key to unlocking the comprehension part of artificial intelligence.<p>I also think that because Latin has become so distant now from mainstream academia has in an essence made our language too simple and rough, lacking poetry and love, and even intelligence.  The dialogues from old movies seem alien to us.<p>If we were to reintroduce Latin, I think society&#x27;s language skills would improve and thereby communication would improve.",1421341461

(A mix up with my wife&#x27;s Amazon order left us suddenly without jumpers. Desperate times, desperate measures.) What a sad place. I ended up with some crappy jumpers that cost 2x more than the good ones we wanted from Amazon. The component section of RS is a joke. They used to be my go to in college (early 90s) when I needed components for a project. Now they are just trash. I left there Christmas Eve thankful I had some jumpers but they have now joined Walmart on my list of places I will only go if I am truly desperate and have exhausted all other options.",1421341442

As autoconfiguration has no place in a server environment anyway, which is the protocol that breaks, there&#x27;s absolutely no need to assign a /64. The more important goal is to avoid fragmentation; it makes more sense to allocate a single larger subnet than multiple smaller ones so as not to fill up routing tables. Externally to your network, you&#x27;d aggregate anyway, but it helps to keep routing tables lean on layer 3 switches which aren&#x27;t capable of as many routes. Also, some vendors&#x27; IPv6 implementations have FIBs that use /64&#x27;s, and may need buckets for multiple subnets within, which can be inefficient. A good compromise is to reserve a /64, but only assign something more reasonable like a /121, with 123-125 usable IPv6 addresses being more than enough in most cases.",1421341415

Revere and Sam Adams picked a fight, and then pretended that the violence they began had been perpetrated by evil, aggressive foreigners against their pure and noble citizens -- the same contemptible monkey-trick that Putin used in Georgia. The South Ossetians began the Russian-Georgian War, by firing artillery at Georgian villages; the Boston rioters began the ""Massacre,"" and the British fired in response to one of their soldiers being knocked down -- not by a thrown rock, but by someone hitting him with a club. That's self-defense, not My Lai or the Katyn Forest; and the verdicts from their trials support that statement.<p>The US has a nasty history of describing anything it doesn't like as a massacre; this is particularly visible in the Indian Wars, in which every incident in which the US wipes out an American Indian village is a ""battle,"" and every incident in which an Indian tribe wipes out a US village is a ""massacre."" I'm not saying that the US was always in the wrong or that it was always in the right -- ""American Indian tribes"" is a pretty broad brush to be painting with, and some tribes (the Cherokee, most prominently) were more civilized than the US while others (the Sioux, for ex.) were honestly pretty barbarous -- but I am saying that traditional US historiography is propagandistic.<p>However, this is changing (although sometimes only by becoming propagandistic in the other direction); and the connotations of the word ""massacre"" remain the same regardless of how the word's been abused.",1271173671

Copyright is there to protect things of value.  ""I want to speak next!"" isn't anything of value.  You realize this yourself, so I wonder why you asked the question in the first place.<p>However, you make the mistake of assuming ""where"" you publish your work is any indication of value.  Indeed, the really good comments are usually well written, and do add value.  You'd also be hard pressed to demonstrate that comments are merely transcribed discussion.  Comments are just the label we've assigned to the posts we make here.<p>So each comment must be weighed on it's own merits.  A comment can be valued, can be ""creative"".  Indeed, one could argue that the desire to include quality comments in a publication could be indicative of it's quality.<p>Now, I see your point.  Essentially, commenting is the 21st century version of a discussion.  Reporters are allowed to report what people said.  What people said can be reported.  A discussion or commenting forum should be considered in the same way.  I don't think copyright works like that.<p>Is there anything out there where this has been tested?<p>Good post, btw.

Paxos provably addresses all of the missing ack problems you suggest and makes progress as long as a quorum of nodes can communicate with each other.  That's why I mentioned it.<p>I'm also aware of the problems with two phase commit, namely the single point of failure.  Funny enough, Paxos Commit is the solution to that problem.<p>So really, Paxos <i>is</i> a magic wand when it comes to available and consistent distributed systems.  You shouldn't use it for every single update in your distributed database; it's way too much overhead.  But somewhere in the system there's probably some algorithm that looks like Paxos handling some important piece of metadata or the system isn't truly fault-tolerant.<p>The link you gave is consistent with what I've said.  Namely, the concept of quorum is a way to sacrifice availability for the minority of nodes in the presence of a partition but otherwise remain consistent.  Paxos does precisely that.  It's consistent and available in the absence of partitions, and it sacrifices availability for some in the presence of a partition.<p>By the way, the other possibility in the design space is to remain available but sacrifice consistency in the face of a partition.

Especially if you use some software that lets you add custom multi-touch gestures, it's really nice to have a huge trackpad with gestures.<p>- Battery life (and longevity) will almost certainly be significantly better on a MacBook Pro.<p>- Apple's support is pretty great. If you have any hardware issues Apple will take good care of you. Sometimes you have to push for it, but I've had a 2 year old computer replaced with a new one because they couldn't fix a relatively minor WiFi issue.<p>- The MacBook Pro displays are really good and viewing angles are much better than most PC displays I've seen. You can optionally bump up the resolution of the 15"" MBP to 1680x1050 for $100.<p>- Backlit keyboard — I thought I wouldn't really care about it, I type in Dvorak anyway so I don't need to see my QWERTY keyboard, but this is actually really nice in low-light situations.<p>- I've also read that there's a lot more that makes Mac hardware fast than just the tech specs.

I left my job with £5k in the bank and a few people who respected my dev skills.<p>In the end I went with it for 3 years. Each year, all in, I probably worked (don't have my old time records to hand) 4 months out of the year total never working more than 4 days in a week and never working for more than 2 weeks in a row.<p>Only once did I need help covering my rent (even then that was only to stop me dropping into my overdraft and not actually to stop me being completely broke).<p>The structure of how I lived killed my motivation to work on anything to benefit myself, and any project I started always ended up being canned 50% through when I lost the starting up movitation. Lack of other people to bounce off and perpetuate the interest and excitement with really showed after the first few months.<p>In the end the total killer to the scheme was the isolation from people every day. Starting with £5k in the bank I came out with £10k in the bank. I would say the only real casualty of all of it was my career path, I've basically been forced back down to developer, but perhaps that in itself isn't such a bad thing for now.<p>The lessons I took out of it were that I'm the kind of person that needs people to bounce ideas and enthusiasm off, so next time I go out to start something up I know I need to find a suitable partner to team with. I also found that I felt a lot less inclined to spend money when I knew how it was earned.

With size, the non-processes that work for smaller firms (coffee break, knowing what everyone’s working on, etc.) were failing.<p>From /. to StackOverflow via HN, Foursquare, etc. there are many examples and templates of how to use karma and game-elements (e.g. badges) to incentivize contributions.  Moreover, many of these elements should be compatible with the work environment as they would permit management to identify contributors (high-karma and badges) and domain experts (subject-area of contribution versus job-title).  The incentive-element should be very strong: if management is on board, employees are on board (e.g., if karma matters as part of one’s work-review).<p>The second part in my process was to speak to future clients (management at mid-sized companies), users (lower-level employees who would use the system) and other entrepreneurs to gauge whether the problem was actually a need (i.e., would anyone be willing to pay for it).",1271171478

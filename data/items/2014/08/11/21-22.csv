Your link indicates no distinction.<p>HFCS is produced by running corn starch through an enzyme process identical to one that happens in your pancreas. Corn starch is broken up into glucose and then half the glucose is converted to fructose.<p>Personally I find HFCS drinks have a mild metalic aftertaste whereas sugar doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know what causes it. But HFCS is metabolically exactly the same as white sugar. And neither are &quot;bad&quot; for you.",1407794353

This person used WPCorp stationery, WPCorp postage, and, no doubt, WPCorp time to tell me he was glad I had left the company. Even though the writer admitted he had never met me, and that he had never worked for me or in a department which reported to me, he had gone out of his way to tell me what a poor job I had done. I was a little hurt by the comments, but I was even more upset that this employee would misuse company resources to send the letter.

8165528,comment,8162506,8165292,1,0,joeheiniger,,,"I think the key difference that the article points out is that the PC gamer does pay more attention to brands, and even individual developers/designers.  People still remember John Romero and John Carmack worked on Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake.  Chris Roberts&#x27; Star Citizen was initially successful almost entirely due to the name Chris Roberts and his reputation.  The recent game Transistor was made by the studio that made Bastion, and got more attention than it would otherwise have gotten initially because of that fact.  If you establish yourself with one good game, PC gamers are far more likely to try your next game, where in mobile frequently people have no idea who wrote Threes, or Draw Something, they just download an app that their friends or Twitter feed mentioned.  You still have to make at least one successful game, but if you get there it&#x27;s a lot easier to maintain gamers&#x27; attention at that point.",1407794086

8165517,comment,8164523,8164949,8,0,pmorici,,,"The government has two different kinds of workers.  Actual employees they pay directly and contract employees they pay through a private company.  Actual employees of the US government are generally paid a mediocre salary at best compared to what they could get in private industry.  Government contract employees on the other hand are generally paid very very well.  In excess of what a typical private sector non-government contract company would pay.  It&#x27;s common knowledge among government employees that you can double your salary by getting a job with a private government contracting company.<p>The essential problem of the US government is there is no accountability.  Poor performing employees are never fired and poor performing contractors are never penalized.  If a project is a massive failure there are never any consequences for the people or companies involved.  Over time anyone with any sort of skill whatsoever tends to leave and what&#x27;s left are the poor and mediocre employees.<p>I&#x27;d like to say creating the US digital service is a positive step but unless the basic problem of accountability is solved it too will be just as bad at IT as every existing organization in a few years time.<p>In the real world this problem of organizational calcification would be solved when the incompetent company goes out of business because they are over taken by competitors.

What you&#x27;re talking about is the technocratic approach, which is often what industry lobbies heavily for – get the government to bless whatever you were going to do anyway and make it complicated to increase the barrier to entry for new companies. This is what we have in many cases coupled with laws which shield companies from the consequences of their mistakes (e.g. try suing a credit agency for spreading incorrect data about you).<p>It&#x27;s not a given that it has to work this way – the other approach which many people in the security industry have called for is changing the laws to shift liability to the companies. That mandates the desirable outcome but allows companies to pick a level of risk which they (and their insurers) are comfortable with – which provides nice incentives to do things like not collect sensitive data if possible – and use whatever technology is appropriate to meet those needs.<p>> Problems like these need to be solved with technology, user friendly and default encryption<p>This is a common misunderstanding. Solving these problems – and ensuring that they stay solved in the future – ultimately costs money. Companies will not spend that unless they have both a requirement and a reasonable expectation that there will be noticeable consequences for not meeting it. Without enforcement, you&#x27;ll get things like those meaningless Verisign / McAfee banners on webpages which signals that they consider security as a marketing exercise.<p>Since the average person is utterly unable to compare different products in this manner and it&#x27;s a difficult, ongoing job even for the skilled security practitioner, there has to be some outside pressure to make information available.

It&#x27;s not so easy to just write a good game and release it: you need a marketing plan, and that&#x27;s where publishers come in. The reviewer from indiegamemag.com should probably have heard of your game through word of mouth before he even plays it -- but word of mouth advertising is almost never accidental.

Keep in mind that at the time, most people did not do their own word processing.<p>WordPerfect 5.2 I remember as being the very best word processor out there.  However, Microsoft came out with MS Word for DOS, and I remember distinctly using Word 2.0.  At the time, there were a lot of issues where sometimes when you typed on Word, you would get snow on the screen, but it was pretty fast compared to WordPerfect.  The rumor was that Microsoft was using special APIs that WordPerfect (and any of their other competitors) didn&#x27;t have access to that allowed them to have faster performance and smaller latency when dealing with larger documents, etc.  But WordPerfect was clearly the superior program.<p>The key was that WordPerfect didn&#x27;t adapt well to Windows.  When Windows 3.1 came out the version of Word for Windows was excellent, vs the version of WordPerfect.  WordPerfect was really clunky from what I remember, and as Windows took off, they never really got any traction and as more version of Windows and Word came around, the difference between Word and WordPerfect grew cavernous.

This sounds like an interesting part of the quantum computing ecosystem, assuming that such an ecosystem evolves.<p>So, a few questions would be:<p>a) what does RC offer that is not already being provided by the academic algorithmic community?<p>b) are you making the assumption that hardware specifics do not have any effect upon your goals?  if so, how confident are you that this is true? does the DWave quantum annealing issue play into this at all?<p>c) do you have any customers lined up yet?<p>d) do you have any kind of &#x27;challenge problem&#x27; which you think would be particularly good at demonstrating what RC (as opposed to QC in general) can do?<p>Best of luck on your startup!",1407791158

The author was sure that mobile was where it was at in 2010, observing that no one was playing consoles (consoles were and are as hot as ever), with nary a mention of PC gaming. They made a, sorry to say, easily replicated game for a niche market, among what already was 100s of thousands of app.<p>In these sorts of stories it&#x27;s always a little more complex, and of course someone will be looking out and making broad conclusions about externals, when some of their own decisions were questionable.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be a critic of the author, but given the number of &quot;see?&quot; type posts, people need to be somewhat more skeptical.<p><i>and realizes that returning to their roots as a PC gamer is the way to go.</i><p>This is almost too much. Steam greenlight is just <i>overwhelmed</i> with hundreds of entrants, and they&#x27;re opening the floodgates even wider. And while I&#x27;m very likely to try out random little games on mobile (particularly if they&#x27;re free to play -- not that I like the model when abused smurfberry style, but it is turning into a &quot;try before you buy&quot; tactic that is reasonable), then pay a dollar or so and get an hour or two of entertainment out of it, it&#x27;s extremely unlikely that I&#x27;m going to install anything from a small studio on my PC -- everything is from megastudios where teams of hundreds worked for years, because that&#x27;s the competition.<p>On the topic of large teams, the baseline on the PC is incredibly high now. Not only the triple-As, of course, but every amateur has a very high baseline of Unity/Unreal/etc. This seems like a godsend (&quot;Yay I have Unity and all of these cool shaders and techniques and seemingly endless power&quot;), but it means that the artistic and technical demands are enormously high and resource intensive.",1407791132

Of course those who have unlimited resources are free to write games even in assembly for each platform, but most don&#x27;t have such resources.<p><i>> And that convenience derives in large part from the monoculture</i><p>Convenience of users has nothing to do with monoculture. It has something to do with form factor and design of hardware and software interfaces. Monoculture is just a sick method to lock developers into one platform. Convenience of developers on the other hand should not be based on poor competition. That&#x27;s a dangerous convenience which leads to stagnation.<p><i>> Low-overhead bare metal programming is what enables the relatively long life of most consoles compared to PC gaming</i><p>Which is a double sided issue.

It&#x27;s about very quickly churning out dozens of games a year and see what sticks. People I know in this business haven&#x27;t become millionaires but they don&#x27;t feel this is a lost cause as business (whether this is also tasteful or not that&#x27;s another question). They usually weep out a game in a weekend, sometime very silly stuff that is just made out of &quot;template game&quot; replaced by stock graphics. In other words, they write little or no code, design little or no graphics for most of the time. Once in a while they might make a game with some original code and graphics but that&#x27;s not typical. When they do this, they have offshore people doing much of the grunt work. Sometimes these offshore people are &quot;permanent&quot; employees of their little company but they don&#x27;t get salaries. Instead they are offered stack in the company. All these keeps net costs down when it comes to cash flow. Most mobile games that have succeeded aren&#x27;t earth shattering graphics or code. So their hope is that one of their silly things would eventually work out and become a huge hit to pay off year or two worth of weekend work.",1407790985

So that was my motivation. I always had these little fictitious motivations that motivated me and got me to do such great work. So I sat down and designed the floppy disk, and Randy Wigginton (he was the guy just out of high school) and I came in every single day including Christmas and New Years for 2 weeks. I came in every single day leading up to, I think it was January 3 or 5, when we went off to Las Vegas. I almost had this floppy disk done.<p>I got it to where it was writing data on a track, reading the data on a track. Then I got it to where it was reading the data in the right byte positions. Then I got it to work with shifting tracks, and we wanted a simple program where we would say ""run checkbook"" or ""run color math"" and it would run the programs that were stored on the floppy disk. So we went off to Las Vegas, and Randy and I worked all night and we got it done to where it was working. At the very end, it was 6:00 a.m. and I said, 'We have to back up this floppy disk."" We had one good disk that we prepared with the data hand-massaged to get it just right. So I stuck it in the floppy and wrote a little program, and I typed in some data and I said ""read track 0,"" stuck in the other floppy and said ""write track 0, read track 1, write track 1."" There were 36 tracksI had to switch floppies back and forth.<p>When I got done, I'm looking at these 2 floppies that look just the same. And I decided that I might have written onto the good one from the bad, and I did. So I had lost it all. I went back to my hotel room. I slept for a while. I got up about 10:00 a.m. or so. I sat down and, out of my head and my listings, recreated everything, got it working again, and we showed it at the show. It was a huge hit. Everybody was saying, ""Oh my God, Apple has a floppy!"" It just looked beautiful, plugged into a slot on our computer. We were able to say ""run color math,"" and it just runs instantly. It was a change in time.<p>But the real eureka moment for me was the very first time I ever read data back. I wrote it on the floppy, which was easy, but read it back, got it right. I just died.""<p>The whole interview (and book) are inspiring:<p><a href=""http://www.foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html</a>",1311382023

2795742,comment,2793579,2793688,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"There's a certain truth value to that.<p>There's also the perception that social networking is <i>the</i> game to be in, and it's been the carrot everyone's been chasing for quite a while, and that AOL saw success with Bebo as absolutely vital to its corporate survival, worth the risks.  Subsequent developments bear this out somewhat as Bebo's failed and been spun off, and AOL continues its decline.<p>There's also the truth that social is a network-effects game. The bigger your network, the greater the value. Up to a point. From a user perspective, the Odlyzko/Tilly refinement of Metcalfe's Law is a better estimator:  <a href=""http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/metcalfe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/metcalfe.pdf</a><p>Essentially: for any member, there are a small number of high-value members of any network. Additional members have a decreasing marginal value, and eventually (particularly with heavy marketing adoption of a network, but also with trolls and other malevolents) many members have a <i>negative</i> participation value. The death of many prior ""social networks"" (Usenet, email, Myspace, early AOL) derives in part from this negative aspect of growth, as well as the flight of high-value participants to nascent (and high S/N) networks. Such as, say, HN.<p>The social value of networks is hugely volatile and tippy. Networks can go from titan to has-been in a matter of a few years, though some survive longer:  AOL, Geocities, Yahoo, MySpace, Facebook, Google+, ....<p>The network effects also come into play on the business side, and the business side of social networking is advertising and marketing. Here Google already have a huge advantage (and are already the subject of some anti-trust investigations). This both increases the likelihood of success for Google and raises the bar for new entrants.<p>The other interesting story from history is that while early-stage technology is often marked by the emergence of walled gardens (think of the time when MCImail, Prodigy, and AOL mail systems couldn't communicate with one another), eventually such networks tend to merge. At the same time, commodity backbone providers (telcos, generally) tend strongly to consolidate. The two opposing factors are commoditization and opening of protocols (e.g.: SMTP) and the monopolization of common carrier infrastructures (rail, telegraph, telephone, radio/TV, mobile, Internet).<p>If history is any guide, we'll eventually see some set of social networking protocols emerge (messaging, identity, authentication, directory services, data interchange), while there's a consolidation of certain back-end services (comms, advertising networks, possibly compute resources and storage). Initiatives such as Diaspora may play a role, or not.  Give that another 4-5 years to play out.",1311381714

No.  Sort of.  It really depends on what you're trying to protect against.  It's absolutely not a panacea, but it will certainly make most attacks against it, where you solely have the DB and any relevant IDs, <i>significantly</i> more expensive.

This redundancy is also something I need to deploy in a somewhat consistent manner if I am to keep a handle on what I'm doing. When there's replication in protecting the data on both sides, at least it's been my experience, that the going back and forth makes more moments for things to be forgotten, so I find that being very systematic in my approach is needed, but being systematic while working in a piecemeal manner, at least for me, is tough.<p>Documenting my code helps some, but having my own linear, self directed narrative about what I've done, what I'm doing, where I'm going, written in a way that I understand and not encumbered by the preoccupation that should accompany, I believe, well documented code, helps a ton. If I can write and not worry about dotting all the I's or crossing all the proverbial T's then a few minutes reading/revising my narrative and I'm ready to jump back in to coding, even if I just got done feeding the baby, changing the diaper, paying the cell phone bill, putting the baby to sleep and then doing a 'honey-do' for my wife.

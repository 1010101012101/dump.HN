The catch is, for the public to join the wifi network they must have a Comcast account in good standing. I can only assume based on Comcast&#x27;s intent to build &quot;the largest public (private) wifi network&quot; themselves and the recent legislative attacks against community/public broadband networks that attempting to create a truly public wifi network using any of the available broadband providers as a backing service would be a Bad Idea. Anecdotally, the wireless broadband providers here are also a joke.",1423846747

But what does that mean?<p>Well, after you’ve imported an .mp3, the program first analyzes the track. Once the analysis is complete, the program can then draw its frequency spectrum -- or, in other words, the image of the music.<p>Once the image has been created, you can play it back with refreq -- and you can actually hear the original music play!<p>But instead of just exploring the image you’ve generated, you can now take that image and create a whole new sound. Just export it as a .png, manipulate it with your preferred image-editing software, like Photoshop, and then import it back into refreq.After you’ve explored your own generated image, try importing a different .png or jpg.

This clearly sounds too good to be true, but everything appears to check out. From what we can tell, the firm appears to be a case of a wealthy individual starting a company to invest their own money, and hiring a small team of people to help them in that task. So far the company has focused on other markets, but is pivoting to focus on seed stage startups in the Palo Alto, California area. My wife has experience as as an employee at a couple startups, but not with fundraising for them. Based on initial discussions with the other employees at the company, no one else does either. As she is the first employee located in this area, she is basically responsible for building the company&#x27;s business in this market from the ground up.<p>So here&#x27;s our question. Suppose you had such an offer and had decided to go with it (as strange as this all sounds). Where would you start? What would you do? Who would you talk to? How would you find and evaluate startups, break into investor social circles, gain entrance to the various start incubators? How would you set appropriate investment goals? How would you avoid the pitfalls normally associated with VCs?<p>Thanks!<p>(Since this is a throwaway account, if you would like us to contact you, please leave us some way to get your contact info.)",1423846329

(11th grade upto now). I taught myself photoshop, illustrator, html/css3(by heart), javascript, jquery, less, bootstrap, underscorejs, phonegap, chrome extensions, git, some linux, gruntjs & concepts...encryption, security, caching, scaling.<p>I&#x27;m learning nodejs/express/mongoose & apis<p>I&#x27;ve made few extensions for chrome but never published them.

Using nodejs i made a scrapper that reads all emails, save body in string, extract emails into an array & make .csv file.<p>But never did paid work. in ads i see salaries from 30k to 190K for experience 2 to 5 years.

9045189,comment,9039274,9044085,0,0,mcphage,,,"That&#x27;s not what the first amendment says.  A lot of laws have inspiration in religion (and tradition)—people believe X, and so want laws that support X.  But if X gets passed as a law, it&#x27;s because people support X, not necessarily because it comes from a religion.  What we&#x27;re seeing with gay marriage is, people are studying the matter, and finding out that the only reasons against it are religion, and tradition.  And those aren&#x27;t sufficient.  So laws against it are being overruled.<p>But that isn&#x27;t to say that religion has (or should have) no influence, because it influences the believers, who then support laws & lawmakers.  Nor is always it possible to separate the beliefs that someone holds for religious reasons, vs. beliefs they hold for other reasons.  But it does mean that a law needs more than religious reasons to stay on the books.  Thankfully, gay marriage seems to be one that is mostly held for religious reasons, so laws preventing it can be dismantled (versus, say, marijuana prohibition.  It&#x27;s more than just religion, so it&#x27;s harder to dismantle).<p>But if all you take away is that people against gay marriage aren&#x27;t driven by sociopathic malice, then that&#x27;s still an improvement.",1423845625

To make a colorable argument that HFTs are frunt-runners, describe a hypothetical sequence of trades in which that happens (&quot;BOB BUY 10 @ $10, CAROL SELL 10 @ $10.01, &c&quot;). If HN history is any guide, that exercise will quickly deflate the notion that there&#x27;s front-running (or even any unfairness) happening.<p>3.

In my limited experience with similar setups (a few Philips Hue bulbs, IP camera, and a Nest thermostat) I haven&#x27;t really run into anything that obnoxious.<p>When I want to kick on the &quot;mood lighting&quot; for a movie or a party or whatever, I just wake my phone and tap one of several presets on the homescreen widget.

Otherwise the handful of IFTTT recipes I set up and geofencing keeps the lights under control the majority of the time without any input from me.<p>Nest is similar.  It&#x27;s reasonably good at learning my patterns and if I want to tweak the temp or change something, I just open an app and the image on the screen matches the display of the physical thermostat.<p>These are certainly early implementations of connected/smart devices but compared to the state of &quot;professional&quot; integrated systems, they&#x27;re just fine with me.

9045165,comment,9044030,9044030,0,0,newscracker,,,"There are at least a few different things to be considered here, and I&#x27;m instantly reminded of a big stinker of a post by Mark Pilgrim about proprietary apps and data formats as well as another old article about how stuff that was archived by some government agency was not even readable or accessible later on due to technology changes (it&#x27;s not one of those referenced in the Wikipedia article for &quot;digital dark age&quot;).<p>Firstly, the medium of storage, the encoding and the interface form one angle to look at. Just like how floppies and CDs are now (almost) obsolete, there would be a future when there won&#x27;t be any machines that recognize a USB storage device. The same would hold good for other technologies that we have quickly run through, to mention a few - PATA, SATA, PCI, PCI-X, PCIe and so on. Can you read an MFM hard drive today with any computer that you have? With adequate care, data can be moved from one medium to another, like how people learned to move music from tapes to CDs and then to flash drives and hard drives, then to the truly nebulous thing called &quot;cloud&quot;, etc.<p>Next, consider the data formats themselves and the applications that support them. This is where proprietary formats, especially those that are not widely popular, would hurt the users. So if you&#x27;re using, for example, Apple&#x27;s document formats on Pages/Numbers/KeyNote, it&#x27;s likely that those files will soon become obsolete (as they already have, where Apple does not support older formats in the newer iWork). Commonly used and supported formats that don&#x27;t change rapidly, like JPG and PDF, for example, are safe for a much longer time because there are many applications to process these documents with, both proprietary as well as FOSS. Even the web pages stored by archive.org or any doc or xls files lying around from about 20 years ago - how many more years do you think browsers, word processors and spreadsheet programs will keep bloating up (like they have been so far) just to support older versions of doc, xls, ppt, html, etc.? At some point, the bloat will have to be cut and a decision made that older formats will not be rendered like they used to be. That would leave some clobbered text or gibberish or both showing up for any interested future humans to figure out whether it&#x27;s worth preserving or not and to convert it to a newer format if they care.<p>Now, assume the data format is a long surviving one, like say, mp3 or jpg. How do you protect it from bit rot wherever it&#x27;s stored? Just because you put it on Amazon or iCloud or Dropbox does not mean you can&#x27;t lose part of the data to corruption of different kinds or lose all of your data due to system failures. Among the people who do regularly backup, perhaps only a fraction of a percentage actually verifies backups (if at all). With consumer level cloud options, there&#x27;s not a lot of hope for data longevity for non-tech savvy people.<p>If you&#x27;re dreaming up a beautiful future in the cloud for all data storage, how can you be sure that your data just doesn&#x27;t vanish or that it doesn&#x27;t diminish in quality? People have had that happen to their precious photos by sites that had sneaky terms and conditions about deleting old photos (or if photo prints are not ordered regularly), didn&#x27;t allow full downloads at any point in time, and sites that went out of business. We can see people treating social networks as reliable cloud storage for their photos as well, disregarding the risks of making such an assumption.<p>Ignore data integrity and data format issues for a moment, and imagine a distant future where 64K displays are common. All your current and older photos and videos would either look terrible on those or may even be completely indistinguishable. Of what use would these artifacts be then for anyone?<p>Considering that a lot of data on the cloud is actually insignificant at the level of the human species (like rants and comments on social networks, LOLcats, etc.) and also the huge amount of data being created every second, how would someone in the future even sift through all this? It&#x27;s somewhat similar to the NSA/GHCQ looking for a needle in a haystack the size of a huge mountain, except that this haystack is to preserve history, culture, etc. The current haystack being built would need a lot of archivists from different backgrounds working continuously to separate the wheat from the chaff and to also look at consolidating (or &quot;packing&quot;) the information concisely (like gathering summaries, sentiments, trends, statistics) if we&#x27;re ever to have an archive that future generations would even want to look at (say centuries ahead in the future). Leaving it to governments alone or corporations alone is not the solution since each would shape the archive in its own image.<p>This is a very complex topic for most individuals to deal with, and the above points didn&#x27;t even touch upon cultural and linguistic shifts that happen over time for any data to be usable. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve missed many other aspects about prolonging the life of (usable and useful) data.<p>P.S.: The best everlasting format, as many tech savvy people know, is plain, unencrypted text for textual content (this still assumes that the media can be read, because encoding may play spoilsport).<p>P.P.S.: All LOLcats may actually be cultural items to preserve for eternity! :P",1423845369

However, the US civilian culture is different and the catch is that few US states&#x27; laws put any limit on discriminating against people with felony convictions, whether it be for a home today, a loan tomorrow, or a job fifty years later.<p>Over the past twenty years, I&#x27;ve been told by many folks in the US tech industry holding unskilled positions that non-white-collar convicts should never be given jobs again, should do all their time in solitary, shouldn&#x27;t have books or access to entertainment, or should be beaten with stones or bats (and a few variations on this theme of torture-as-penance, always by women oddly.)

I am not 100% sure how she managed that vis-a-vis her employer, but I&#x27;m guessing that she had a conversation with them and put her cards on the table, and that they came to an agreement of some sort. Incidentally, IANAL, but my understanding of those workplace IP agreements is that they only cover inventions and ideas you come up with &quot;in the course of performing your job,&quot; or something to that effect. They do not cover nights and weekends. Read your contract&#x27;s fine print, though, because there have been horror stories here.<p>Hit me up over email (address in my profile) if you&#x27;re interested in speaking to my friend about her experience.

but then I don&#x27;t
&#x27;log in&#x27; to Google or accept cookies from them.
So, the videos I see on the right are related
to what I am watching at the time instead of whatever
I&#x27;ve watched, searched for, etc. in the past.<p>I can believe that Google is doing what you
describe, and this is a symptom of totally
wacko <i>data science</i> and brain-dead <i>recommendation
engine</i> construction.  Where from, why?<p>One approach to recommendation is to try to
say what a given user <i>likes</i>.  So, look at
all their activity, say, products they&#x27;ve looked
at at Amazon, videos they&#x27;ve seen at YouTube,
searches they&#x27;ve done at Google, Web sites
they&#x27;ve visited as determined by following
<i>third party cookies</i>, etc.  Then my view
is:<p>(1) For ad targeting, in the short term
(that is, when displaying an ad
only a short time after the data used
for the targeting)
maybe okay for effective ad targeting,
assuming it doesn&#x27;t 
offend the user.<p>(2) For content, nope, won&#x27;t work and
with your experience a solid example
of why not.<p>Why?  Here is a hypothetical example:
I go online and search for
flowers and chocolate candy and
have them delivered gift wrapped;
similarly for some things at
Victoria&#x27;s Secret.
So, from then on I get <i>recommendations</i>
for flowers, candy, anything chocolate,
and women&#x27;s frilly undies.<p>Ha!  I&#x27;m
a fully normal, heterosexual male
and don&#x27;t much care for distaff stuff!
So, why&#x27;d I buy the flowers?  Sure: 
As Valentines gift for my wife, once
a year!  The other 364 days of the
year, f&#x27;get about it!<p>Or, I shop for some DVDs of some
old Disney movies.  Does this mean
that I like old Disney movies instead
of, say, movies about Tom Clancy stories?
Nope!  Instead I was just shopping for
some DVDs to entertain the children
of some of my friends my wife and
I had over for a nice 
BBQ and beer on the back porch.<p>Or, as I see it, for something better,
what a person <i>likes</i> at a given
time should to be for some one of their
<i>interests</i> at that time.  Then the
recommendation engine has to
<i>learn</i> about that <i>interest</i> at that
time.<p>A biggie is that that <i>interest</i>
is likely some <i>narrow</i> thing, <i>narrow</i>
in time, circumstances, etc.  So,
past browsing history, shopping,
watching, etc. should be treated as,
first cut, irrelevant or, in probabilistic
terms, independent of what the heck the
person wants in their present context.<p>BTW, with mild assumptions,
probabilistically independent implies
(statistically) uncorrelated, although
in the usual treatments independence is
much, much more general, say, is in terms
of sigma algebras generated by some
sets, possibly uncountably infinite,
of random variables, and such a definition
for uncorrelated is rarely or never given.<p>With high irony, likely search results
at Google from the keywords/phrases
someone enters are likely independent
or nearly so of anything else Google
knows about the person.  Or, if at Google
search type in<p>&quot;I&#x27;m shocked, shocked to learn that 
gambling is going on here&quot;<p>then should get back the script of the
classic movie <i>Casablanca</i> and

I suffer from crippling joint pain. When it attacks my wrists I can&#x27;t even hold a cup of coffee with one hand. I feel every beat of my heart as a pulse of pain in my wrists. It&#x27;s not carpal tunnel though so I&#x27;m not sure how that plays in to this opinion for your situation but some co-workers have told me this holds for their CT too.<p>==Mouse==
First, your mouse is your worst enemy. The buttons on your mouse are crappy and way too stiff. The constant small motion of clicking, clicking, clicking from the exact same position just sets you up for a fast increase in pain when you go back to your keyboard. I&#x27;ve tried mousing left and right handed to spread the pain. You can hook up two mice at the same time with no change to functionality and you get used to using your other hand fairly quickly. Still not much good though! I&#x27;ve tried trackballs, sideways ergonomic mice, and everything else you can think of. They all suffer from the crappy stiff minimal travel buttons. The thing that works best for me is a touchpad ... and learning to use a light tap! My favorite stand alone is the Logitech Wireless T650 (<a href=""http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/touchpad-t650"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/touchpad-t650</a>). Tracks well, handles very light taps, and is nice and big for a touchpad. Next is the Adesso Smart Cat 410 (<a href=""http://www.adesso.com/products/product-detail-97.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adesso.com/products/product-detail-97.html</a>). It&#x27;s wired and not as big, but it has edges and I like the ability to bump up along the right edge and scroll with one finger rather than the Logitech two finger scroll. It gets the scroll right a bit more consistently. Either of these touchpad allow me to use a keyboard longer.<p>==Keyboards and Switches==
The Cherry switches are ALL too stiff. The reds and browns are best with the reds having an activation force of 45 cN. The browns are smoother but have a 55 cN activation force. And none of them bottom out nicely for me. You can use little o-rings to help a bit. The best way to try all the Cherry switches is with this little device here: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N6DXTW4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N6DXTW4</a>. But I couldn&#x27;t come up with any keyboard/configuration that really helped me. I&#x27;ve got a good dozen high end mechanical keyboards sitting in a closet. And I found little difference between brands, keyboard layouts, &quot;ergonomic keyboards&quot;, etc.<p>Topre makes what might be a good solution in that they make keyboards with variable key weights depending on key positions. Their boards are about $250 but I&#x27;ve not tried one as their home keys still seem too great a force for me at this point.<p>For me, my go to keyboard is the Adesso SlimTouch 4400 series (<a href=""http://www.adesso.com/products/product-detail-82.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adesso.com/products/product-detail-82.html</a>). It comes in both USB and wireless versions. The keys are cheapish membrane switches and are still too stiff, but the travel and bottoming out are very good. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a bit hit or miss as any particular keyboard might be stiffer than one in another batch. Not sure why though. It also has a built in reasonable quality touchpad for your right hand. There are some new Adessos that I&#x27;ve not tried but look interesting. For example <a href=""http://www.adesso.com/products/product-detail-149.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adesso.com/products/product-detail-149.html</a>. I probably should give it a go.<p>The best keyboard I&#x27;ve tried is the Razor Deathstalker Ultimate (<a href=""http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-deathstalker-ultimate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-deat...</a>). The key travel and bottoming out are excellent. The activation force is still too high though. However, this is a silly expensive keyboard because of the built in touchpad/display which, for all the hype and engineering effort they put into it, is a crap touchpad. The sheer number of times a tap isn&#x27;t turned into a touch or turned into a double tap makes this thing a joke. All the time and effort razer must have spent making the little display do everything imaginable EXCEPT making it work as a touchpad. WTF razer!<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth it to look in to Dragon for voice to text. It&#x27;s worthless for programming but can help take joint burden away for long text only things. Speaking of which ... I&#x27;ll stop here.",1423843789

If anything, women seem to get an unfair advantage just because they are women and &quot;under represented.&quot;</i><p>The education system is part of the tech industry as a whole, and, of course, there&#x27;s a feedback loop at play that reinforces the tech stereotypes over time. So even if no one person in the tech industry is consciously trying to discriminate against women, the industry in aggregate can play that role. I would argue that the numbers alone demonstrate a gender bias.<p>The women in tech who I&#x27;ve talked with about this issue certainly don&#x27;t feel that they have an unfair advantage, and I&#x27;ve heard some pretty interesting criticisms. A couple examples:<p>- senior technical talent hiring practices are typically defined by men (since the industry is predominantly male), so the selection criteria for career progression is likely to have male-oriented biases.<p>- it&#x27;s more socially awkward for a man and woman to get together for a drink after work in a career capacity, so it&#x27;s correspondingly harder for a woman to share in the bonding experiences that build career-long relationships.

The article quoted someone who thinks that Silicon Valley investment scene is an &quot;old boy&#x27;s club&quot;, and says:<p><i>&quot;The tech industry is notoriously ageist. It often shuns women, minorities, and others who don’t fit into the rising “brogrammer” culture.&quot;</i><p>I don&#x27;t really buy into the last clause of that sentence, but IMO the percentage of women and certain minorities speaks for itself. I also believe (hope?) that, as I mentioned above, this bias can be attributed to unconscious bias in the industry as a whole, rather than overt -isms. I think that this is something we can help to fix, but a critical first step is to acknowledge that the diversity profile of the tech industry doesn&#x27;t match up to the population as a whole, and that at a certain point that leads to practices that are self-reinforcing.",1423843715

So the idea that supplements just need FDA regulation like &#x27;regular drugs&#x27; is largely fallacious.<p>- Why should supplements need clinical trials for marketing approval when that isn&#x27;t the standard for other any other comparable drugs on the market? I.e. almost all drugs that were in use before the 50s are allowed to be marketed without any testing for safety or efficacy, and since almost all supplements have a much longer history of human use, why should they be treated differently?",1423843271

In fact, it is the only way that a distributed market could possibly work.<p>The market maker has some finite capacity to provide liquidity (e.g. they have position limits, they need to post margin, they have certain risk tolerances). They want to maximise the chances of their orders being traded on (i.e. providing liquidity), so they post liquidity on all available markets.<p>When they match on one of those markets, their capacity to provide liquidity has diminished, until they manage to offset their position somewhere (either on the same market, or on a different one). Moreover, they have just received a new piece of information about the supply/demand imbalance for this particular stock. For both of these reasons, it is natural to assume that they would want to adjust the prices they are offering on other exchanges. The market cannot function any other way.",1423843238

7984953,comment,7983025,7983991,1,0,paletoy,,,"Max, surely healthcare(at the level available at the time) was much more affordable in 64. Just at the share of healthcare as part of  GDP(which rises at maybe double than inflation for a long time) - the general inequality in society.And people in general are angry about this affordability issue, while greatly appreciating the miracles of medicine(reflected in high end medicine). Also some people are angry about the somewhat lacking quality of medicine.<p>And they are probably right - more affordable/equitable  healthcare can be had while still having high quality medicine. And the problem with quality in healthcare is also a problem we can solve much of through better tools and procedures.",1404413890
7984952,comment,7983281,7984183,5,0,chimeracoder,,,"> If our health sector ran as efficiently as everyone else&#x27;s (as a fraction of GDP/capita), the money we currently pay for medicare and medicaid would suffice to provide universal coverage for every single person in the US.<p>This isn&#x27;t an apples-to-apples comparison for several reasons (some which overstate the amount of money, some which understate).<p>One, there are a number of things which fall under Medicare&#x27;s budget which you and I wouldn&#x27;t think of as the &quot;main&quot; purpose of Medicare in this context (ie, providing medical insurance to the elderly).<p>On the other hand, look at the profit margins of any hospital broken down by insurance status. Virtually any hospital hemorrhages money on uninsured patients, Medicare patients, and Medicaid patients. They make this up by charging patients on private insurance, and in the end eke out low single-digit profit margins if they&#x27;re lucky (most aren&#x27;t). If you&#x27;re on private insurance, you&#x27;re essentially subsidizing the medical care of the aforementioned groups (whether you pay it in the form of your deductible, or in the form of your premiums[0]).<p>As the largest payer, Medicare has the leverage in order to decide what it will and will not pay for, and providers have very little choice but to accept that, whether or not it&#x27;s economically feasible for them. (This is the exact inverse of the situation most of us are in with our ISP/cable providers (we have an essential monopoly on broadband access in most parts of the US). When there is a single purchaser, this is known not as a monopoly but as a monopsony[1])<p>It&#x27;s easy to say that &quot;costs are too high&quot; - that&#x27;s fine, but <i>where</i> are they too high?<p>The easy response to this is that hospitals and doctors are making too much money. But in reality, most hospitals are struggling just to say solvent, which is why we&#x27;ve seen massive consolidation in hospitals in the last several years as hospitals go out of business. The same is true of doctors, who are selling to these larger hospitals because their private practices are now financially unsustainable[2]. Of course, this really just pushes the problem up the food chain, because those same hospitals are already struggling to keep the lights on.<p>I don&#x27;t really have an answer to this, by the way... I just want to relay an appreciation of why the situation hasn&#x27;t been fixed yet  - it&#x27;s very complex, and nearly every option involved has significant, serious tradeoffs that nobody really wants to address (whether for political reasons, ethical reasons, or otherwise).<p>[0] Remember that the size of your premiums are (loosely) linked to the expected value of providing medical care for you. Mathematically this is trivial to show - in reality, the market isn&#x27;t so efficient, but it&#x27;s simple enough to say that if your insurers&#x27; costs go up, in the long run, your premiums will as well.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony</a><p>[2] This 116-page report gives a very extensive analysis of the economic state of physicians.

Communications companies generate significant savings by driving people to self-help on their website or through chat reps (where they can handle 10 customers at a time). Also, longer wait times helps increase the barrier to frivolous calls and complaints.<p>That said, my point was that there are likely some additional ways that they can target customers to improve customer service in a way that optimizes both their own workflow as well as that of the customer. The important part is to get both parties on the same incentive structure.",1404413876

7984929,comment,7983251,7983251,7,0,joshuak,,,"People seem to be misunderstanding the point, and requirements of the DMCA Safe Harbor provisions. The take down procedure is to allow companies such as Github to avoid being involved in a dispute in <i>any</i> way. Meaning if a lawsuit should occur they don&#x27;t win because they complied with DMCA they get to avoid the suit altogether.<p>Given one lawsuit can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in litigation even for the winning side, it would be impossible for any ISP to operate in a climate where they could be dragged into every argument over content rights.  Github is not the authority.  They don&#x27;t know if the code is inferring or not, so the DMCA says they can defer the authority (and liability) to those who should know, the ones who put the code up in the first place.<p>It is unreasonable to expect Github to vet every open source project, and it is also unreasonable for Github to bare any legal responsibility just because one of their users, or a litigious copyright holder did something wrong. The DMCA Safe Harder is designed specifically to account for this.<p>Although technically possible it is not legally possible to issue a DMCA take down by bot, since a bot can not provide: a statement by the copyright owner, a statement of the accuracy of the notice, or a statement under penalty of perjury that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner.<p>[My opinion is, if a real person uses a bot and then makes these statements under penalty of perjury, then every time that bot makes a mistake we (the tech community) should be filing Amicus curiae[1] with the court that they have perjured themselves.  If you are a technically competent person you cannot honestly make a statement that your bot has not made any mistakes without human review.]<p>The weakness of the DMCA Safe Harbor arises not in the above issues but rather in the fact that the DMCA requires that materials be taken down immediately before response by the allegedly infringing party[2].  To balance that (to some degree) if the allegedly infringing party follows the procedure to have the materials restored, then the ISP must restore the materials in 14 days unless the complaining party has shown evidence they have filed a case.<p>In other words if a complaining party fails to immediately follow with a lawsuit the materials <i>MUST</i> be restored.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/</a>",1404413672

Dilution happens when new shares are issued causing your percentage ownership to go down.  <i>In general</i> it&#x27;s not a bad thing - when there&#x27;s a new funding round the new cash will increase the value of the company to balance out the dilution and you end up with your equity being the same value.  The thing people forget about when they talk about dilution from new rounds is that the cash added to the balance sheet increases the value of the company, probably even more than 1:1.<p>Liquidation preference is what happens when the preferred shares have a clause that says they are guaranteed 2x or 3x what they put in on any liquidity event.  So if you take $10mm at 3x liquidation preference then that means any exit has an immediate $30mm taken off the table.  A $30mm exit now becomes a $0 exit for the employees.

Most home owners would be able to pay off their mortgages and own their homes. All student debts would be easily paid off, and then some. Much inequality (outside the 1%) would vanish temporarily, since the difference between 1 million and 1 million and a small amount of savings isn&#x27;t that much.<p>People would try to spend their money, resulting in much more demand, bottlenecks, and shortages. Of course this leads to inflation, but it also means the recession is over. Businesses would run out of everything and try to expand to try to meet supply, but their suppliers would raise prices too, maybe too high to make a profit. It would be a chaotic situation and people on fixed incomes would be screwed once the money runs out. It&#x27;s hard to plan a business under these circumstances, but I&#x27;m sure some people would be smart enough to figure out a good plan.<p>So this is not &quot;back where we started.&quot; It&#x27;s a big reset that changes just about everything and probably a big disaster if it&#x27;s sprung onto people without warning.<p>On the other hand, if properly planned and at a smaller scale, it could have some good effects.

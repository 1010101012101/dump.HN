The article is a little confusing, but it seems that the current research has linked it to a mechanism which is also involved in the ""starving mice live longer"" phenomenon.   That's definitely good news, scientifically.<p>But the ""wonder drug"" theme is a little overstated.

235756,comment,235390,235736,0,0,jrockway,,,"C is entrenched.  Everyone uses it, and because everyone uses it, everyone continues to use it.  That doesn't make it good, though, just popular.  Read pg's ""Beating the Averages"" for a more eloquent explanation.<p>You seem to think that Java is C's competition.  It's not.  I think we can all agree that Java is one of the worst programming languages ever created.  (The VM is nice though.)  Nobody is telling you to use Java or C++.  They are telling you to use a dynamic language (Perl/Python/Ruby) or a functional language (Haskell/OCaml/Lisp).<p><i>I don't know how C programmers do it, but somehow they just get things done.</i><p>Sure, but their programs usually leak memory (ever use Firefox?), and their libraries handle errors by terminating the whole program (see PulseAudio; any error condition immediately calls exit(1)).<p><i>There isn't a reasonably popular CPU on this planet that doesn't have a C compiler for it, while Java runs only on ""java computers"".</i><p>I don't optimize my life for solving problems I don't have.  Every machine I want my code to run on has Perl, Lisp, Haskell... whatever.  If C was the highest-level language I could use, then obviously I'd use it.  But it's not, so I don't.<p>Finally, gcj will compile Java down to machine code; ghc compiles Haskell to native code.  So I don't ever see a situation where I will absolutely have to use C for some reason (other than interfacing with C libraries, of course).",1215125277

Like... everything :)<p>But, I don't think it's very valuable to know.  It doesn't put you in a good position to write correct, maintainable software.  There are no tools for that, only for twiddling bits.  Therefore, I think C should be relegated to interfacing with UNIX (which you Just Have To Do) and small number-crunching routines.  In those cases, there's really nothing to screw up (UNIX interface -- allocate resources, mutate them, deallocate; number crunching, call a function with some arguments).  For both of those uses, C has been very successful.  Just don't write a big application with it, there are <i>much</i> better tools for that.",1215124993

235748,comment,235706,235732,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Well, I don't know. Popularity definitely gets you libraries, but to a large extent, the runtimes are VERY daunting even to interested people. The author raises some valid issues with CL implementations. I'd also add concurrency/threading, for example. Part of the problem is that the standard (in my opinion) standardises some of the ""wrong"" things. In part, that's just down to its age, but also just the whole ""design by committee"" problem. So if there are important omissions in the standard, you get a load of implementations that technically comply, but in effect are incompatible with one another for any real work.<p>Most of the popular newer languages have a ""benevolent dictator"" (or not so benevolent in some cases), which means there's a reference implementation which almost everyone uses. Okay, maybe you lose out a bit on runtime quality, but I think the current trend towards building on top of the JVM, etc. will continue and alleviate that particular problem.<p>I also tried to use Common Lisp, I really did. I liked the core, but in the end it was the sheer volume of little problems that drove me away. Luckily, I've found a lovely compromise in Clojure.",1215124424

You might think that in a TV studio, you'd be able to see what you look like on TV. Not so! There's generally no loopback feed because there's often a satellite (so they say) delay, which can confuse you since you'd be watching yourself from a few seconds ago. It was really disconcerting for me not knowing what I looked like, but I guess you get used to it.<p>3) For West Coast people: refuse to do 7 AM East Coast talk shows.

And if he used Lisp instead, after the initial W hour investment, he would save Z hours on less maintenance and coding time thanks to Lisp's power.<p>Is Z greater than W, or less than W? That's the critical question for him.<p>How can he decide which approach is best without estimating the hour values of each variable?<p>Edit: of course there's some other issues. maybe he'd spend 80 hours on python maintenance vs 100 writing lisp unicode support. the numbers are made up, but the point is that maintenance probably isn't much fun, so one might choose the lisp path even if it takes a bit more time. besides fun, one might learn more that way.",1215123967

The idea is that it's not a percentage of lifespan that you can gain, but rather a fixed amount of time. He says the data supports his interpretation, and that it makes sense evolutionarily because extending lifespan in response to low calories is mostly useful if you can get through a short famine and get a chance to mate that would have otherwise been lost.

I know this flies in the face of red-blooded 'merican ""all socialism is evil"" doctrine, but public sector research, funded by tax-payer money, is needed to build the foundations for tomorrow's industries.  Quantum computing, like many other bleeding edge fields, is too immature, too high-risk, and with pay-offs that are far too distant for the private sector.<p>Research and education are both investments that can yield fantastic returns, but they are long-term investments and require steady commitment rather than periodic outbursts of zeal punctuating long periods of apathy.  A minor cut now might help balance the books today, but the lost opportunities down the road will more than negate that.<p>Top researchers don't hang around after you cut the funding they run their labs and pay their students and post-docs with.  They go where the money they need to work is, and if they can't find that in the U.S., they'll likely find it in Canada, China, Australia, etc..

There was no &quot;credence&quot; lent to it being viewed as such; it was mistake and was admitted as such, and corrected. It was intended to read &quot;sexual interest&quot;, not sexual orientation.<p>“In fact, APA considers pedophilic disorder a ‘paraphilia,’ not a ‘sexual orientation.’ This error will be corrected in the electronic version of DSM-5 and the next printing of the manual,” the organization said. The error appeared on page 698, said a spokeswoman.<p>The fluidity of the APA DSM is not something that is worth arguing; we can all agree that definitions change and have changed. I&#x27;m operating under the current set of definitions and primarily wanted to make the point that likening paraphilic disorders as &quot;sexual orientations&quot; is typically hurtful for reasons that probably don&#x27;t require explaining.",1406253590

We&#x27;d pick a bit out of lawns as we roamed the neighborhood and chew on it. It&#x27;s been decades since I&#x27;ve seen a neighborhood like that...</i><p>Clover was not considered a weed until the 1950s, when 2,4-D became the herbicide of choice.<p>Before then, seed companies intentionally added clover into their grass seed mixes.  Clover will grow in nitrogen-deficient soil because it can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere.  Grass cannot.  If you wanted to avoid bare patches on your lawn, you needed the clover.<p>For example, the book <i>Planting and Care of Lawns</i> (1931) recommends planting lawns north of 35 N latitude with a mixture containing 5% clover: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=_vL1mNCfVDAC&pg=PA8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=_vL1mNCfVDAC&pg=PA8</a><p><pre><code>  For the greater part of region 1 the following mixture\n  has proved quite satisfactory: Kentucky bluegrass 17 parts,\n  redtop 2 parts, white clover 1 part by weight.\n</code></pre>\nOnce 2,4-D became popular, anything that it killed became regarded as a weed.  This included clover, so clover became a weed.",1406253557

8083437,comment,8082849,8083112,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"Airbnb makes it easier for naive or unsophisticated &quot;landlords&quot; to rent out their properties. Yes, those would-be landlords should educate themselves about what they are getting into. But you could argue that Airbnb, by dint of its existence and its success, is lowering the barriers to entry for the would-be landlords of the world -- and thus bears a social and ethical, if not necessarily a legal, responsibility to educate or protect those people from common mistakes. And besides, it&#x27;s just good business to watch out for your customers.<p>The woman in question was not aware of the problems involved in 30+-day leases. We can fall back on the idea that she was ignorant, and that she got what was coming to her. True. But that&#x27;s victim-blaming, and it&#x27;s only half satisfactory. She is the kind of person who would not have invested in, and rented out, a property without the existence of a hand-holding site like Airbnb. Accordingly, Airbnb should do its part to ensure that people like her -- people entering the market <i>because</i> of Airbnb, and who are presumably unsophisticated -- are reasonably protected from rookie mistakes.<p>I don&#x27;t think Airbnb is to blame here. I don&#x27;t think Airbnb owes her any money. But I do think it should be thinking very carefully about how to retool its process, so that situations like these don&#x27;t pop up again. Not for legal reasons, but for UX reasons. Airbnb operates a two-sided marketplace, and maintaining that two-sided marketplace means balancing the needs of both sides of the market.<p>It seems that Airbnb is offering to assist her with her legal expenses, and I applaud them for that. No, they probably don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to do that. But &quot;We don&#x27;t have to&quot; is a pretty lousy excuse to fall back on. Customer service matters, even if it means protecting your customers from their own mistakes (within reason).",1406253469

8083424,comment,8082728,8082728,6,0,hibikir,,,"With most of those problems pretty much gone, functional programming is doing quite a bit better than it did 15 years ago. Hybrids languages are gaining popularity: You can find Scala in quite a few large companies out there.<p>Major adoption of non-hybrid languages doesn&#x27;t seem like something that will happen any time soon though, and it sure seems like the FP community actually wants it that way. We just sent one of our people to attend Lambdajam, and in his 5 minute version of what he learned, he was telling us how his impression is that there were plenty of Haskell people there that seemed to barely tolerate having any talk about Scala in the conference. Badmouthing of hybrid languages is the order of the day by extremely prominent members of the FP community, even if they end up using said languages in their presentations.<p>So I suspect that the future of FP is to be influential, for most of the best bits to be copied by language makers that build communities that care about marketing, and Haskell and the like will remain used only by people that just think there&#x27;s no way to write any useful program without first learning all about category theory.",1406253175

5647174,comment,5646575,5646672,1,0,dalke,,,"""enthusiast crapfest"" .. perhaps in a hilly area, or region which doesn't keep bike traffic in mind. But as every discussion on this topic points out, there are cities (Amsterdam and Copenhagen are the most common examples) which include bike traffic as an integral part of the city and building construction, so people use bikes for practical reasons, and not only for enthusiasm.<p>In any case, have you looked at what the manufacturers say about ""normal sized bikes""? Trek specifies a weight limit of 275 lbs for a road bike and 300 lbs for a city bike ( <a href=""http://www.trekbikes.com/faq/questions.php?questionid=104"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trekbikes.com/faq/questions.php?questionid=104</a> ) while Schwinn bikes meant ""To be ridden on paved roads only"" have a limit of 275 lbs ( <a href=""http://media.schwinnbikes.com/skin/frontend/schwinn/default/pdf/Schwinn-Owners-Manual_IBD.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.schwinnbikes.com/skin/frontend/schwinn/default/...</a> ).<p>Based on that Schwinn link, it appears that ""ASTM CONDITION 1"" bicycles have a rider limit of 275 lbs and luggage limit of 10 lbs.<p>These Citi Bikes have a limit of 265 and 11 lbs, respectively. No, it doesn't make sense to me that they are of a lower limit than the Trek and Schwinn bikes. Still, it seems there is an entire class of bicycles that aren't designed to withstand the 290 lbs that you think is reasonable.<p>Of course, even if they were designed to handle 300 lbs, there would still be a restriction on those who are over 300 lbs, and this headline and the arguments therein would be unchanged. Citi Bike can't win in that case.<p>There has to be a limit. What should that limit be? The sumo wrestler Asashry Akinori weighs 330 lbs. Should the bikes be designed with people like him in mind? U.S. sumo wresting champion Kelly Gneiting was 400 pounds when he did the L.A. marathon. John Taylor, is a defensive tackle for the Central Penn Piranha of the semiprofessional Gridiron Developmental Football League and weighs 500 lbs. These are athletes. Should all of the bikes be designed with them in mind?<p>I say no. At some point it's just not reasonable.",1367528167

The first business CRUD app was a huge breakthrough. But today, making CRUD apps, which is still how a whole lot of programmers make their living, is becoming an increasingly concave task, as the technically difficult parts are being abstracted away. We won't really need any more LAMP developers soon--Rails is really only one layer of abstraction below the point where non-programmers will be able to generate functioning CRUD apps with a few mouseclicks, to collect their business data. So, those ""million jerks"" are getting closer to being right every day, if your job as a software engineer is just making CRUD apps.<p>So, now ""data science"" (aka massively parallel processing of large distributed datasets with statistical modeling and machine learning techniques) is where the convex work is.

There is no need for a developer to worry about threads at all when writing a vert.x handler. That handler will only ever be called from a single thread. So using a simple array is fine. Using the JsonArray is even better, because then it matches the Onion test idiomatically speaking. Which, I agree, is what you should be going for.<p>""...The Onion test was contributed by a reader and admittedly its compliance with the specification we've created is perhaps a bit dubious.

That's exactly how I would write the Onion test. I was just wondering why the other tests went out of their way to decode Json and the reencode Json for each result. Onion only ever encodes to Json once, other tests are encoding and decoding multiple times. I only pointed out Vert.x because it was the most egregious. I mean in that case the answer from the persistor is already in Json. It is put in a non Json data structure... and then that data structure is encoded to Json??? Just seemed weird.<p>----<p>EDIT: Just verified that there is no need for thread safe code in a Vert.x handler.

I don't like that I have potentially thousands of enemies, but sometimes a person like me has to do the right thing, even at the cost of unpopularity. 25 percent are just completely indifferent. 25 percent view me positively because they want to see Google improve and think it takes someone like me to draw executive attention to problems.<p>Oddly enough, I'm probably doing more good for Google engineers than anyone realizes, because upper management is now aware of abuses in the middle and, at least, has a chance to correct them.

That argument became invalid about 4 years ago I think around the time Eclipse Helios was released.<p>Now-a-days, starting a Tomcat or TomEE JVM in debug mode with Eclipse gives you the ability to hot swap probably 95% of your changes. It doesn't supporting adding completely new functions or changing declared fields. JRebel <i>does</i> support this though.<p>As a matter of fact, if you're in a stack frame and you pause the execution pointer with a breakpoint, you can completely change the code of the function and the JVM will discard the current stack frame and then restart the functional call.

As much as possible, we want each test to be representative of idiomatic production-grade usage of the framework or platform.  Furthermore, we have solicited contributions from fans of frameworks and the frameworks' authors.  A side objective is that the code double as an example of how best to use the framework or platform.<p>All of this means we fully expect that the implementation approaches will vary significantly.<p>The multiple query test has a client-provided count of queries, so in most Java cases, we create a fixed-size array to hold the results fetched from the database.  I wrote the Servlet and Gemini tests, so I can confirm that behavior in those tests.<p>We are not Vert.x experts and we have not yet received a community contribution for the Vert.x test.  However, it is our understanding that idiomatic Vert.x usage encourages the use of asynchronous queries.  The question then is: how do we collect the results into a single List in a threadsafe manner?  Is your JsonArray alternative threadsafe?  Admittedly, using a CopyOnWriteArrayList gave us pause, but we are not (yet) aware of a better alternative.<p>The Onion test was contributed by a reader and admittedly its compliance with the specification we've created is perhaps a bit dubious.  We want a JSON serializer to process an in-memory object into JSON.  I'm not certain if the Onion implementation matches that expectation, but the test implementation nevertheless seemed sufficiently idiomatic for his platform.<p>We're certainly open to more opinions on that matter.",1367526015

For instance, even if I only look at... say... java frameworks, you seem to implement the exact same feature in very different ways between platforms. For instance, for servlets, you will store all of the results in a simple array... and then write them out when you are done. Like so:<p><pre><code>    final World[] worlds = new World[count];\n    final Random random = ThreadLocalRandom.current();\n    \n    try (Connection conn = source.getConnection())\n    {\n      try (PreparedStatement statement = conn.prepareStatement(DB_QUERY,\n          ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY))\n      {\n        // Run the query the number of times requested.\n        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)\n        {\n          final int id = random.nextInt(DB_ROWS) + 1;\n          statement.setInt(1, id);\n          \n          try (ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery())\n          {\n            if (results.next())\n            {\n              worlds[i] = new World(id, results.getInt(""randomNumber""));\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    catch (SQLException sqlex)\n    {\n      System.err.println(""SQL Exception: "" + sqlex);\n    }\n    \n    // Write JSON encoded message to the response.\n    try\n    {\n      Common.MAPPER.writeValue(res.getOutputStream(), worlds);\n    }\n    catch (IOException ioe)\n    {\n      // do nothing\n    }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nBut for other frameworks, like Vert.x, you use CopyOnWriteArray to store all of the results... and then write them out when you are done. Like so:<p><pre><code>    private final HttpServerRequest req;\n    private final int queries;\n    private final List<Object> worlds = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();\n\n        .\n        .\n        .\n\n    @Override\n    public void handle(Message<JsonObject> reply)\n    {\n      final JsonObject body = reply.body;\n\n      if (""ok"".equals(body.getString(""status"")))\n      {\n       this.worlds.add(body.getObject(""result""));\n      }\n\n      if (this.worlds.size() == this.queries)\n      {\n        // All queries have completed; send the response.\n        // final JsonArray arr = new JsonArray(worlds);\n        try\n        {\n          final String result = mapper.writeValueAsString(worlds);\n          final int contentLength = result.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8).length;\n          this.req.response.putHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/json; charset=UTF-8"");\n          this.req.response.putHeader(""Content-Length"", contentLength);\n          this.req.response.write(result);\n          this.req.response.end();\n        }\n        catch (IOException e)\n        {\n          req.response.statusCode = 500;\n          req.response.end();\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, you literally create a new array each time you add a result to that CopyOnWriteArray. In fact, not only are you creating a new array, but you are creating new copies of the data in the array as well. Seems a little strange??? DEFINITELY inefficient. Is there a reason that is implemented differently? It seems to me that, at the least, they should both use arrays... but maybe there is something more you guys are testing???<p>The Onion C based code is written in an even MORE efficient manner for the multiple queries test. It actually stores it's results in json format from the outset! Like so:<p><pre><code>    json_object *json=json_object_new_object();\n    json_object *array=json_object_new_array();\n    int i;\n    for (i=0;i<queries;i++){\n        json_object *obj=json_object_new_object();\n\n        snprintf(query,sizeof(query), ""SELECT * FROM World WHERE id = %d"", 1 + (rand()%10000));\n        mysql_query(db, query);\n        MYSQL_RES *sqlres = mysql_store_result(db);\n        MYSQL_ROW row = mysql_fetch_row(sqlres);\n\n        json_object_object_add(obj, ""randomNumber"", json_object_new_int( atoi(row[1]) ));\n        json_object_array_add(array, obj);\n        mysql_free_result(sqlres);\n    }\n    json_object_object_add(json,""json"",array);\n    const char *str=json_object_to_json_string(json);\n</code></pre>\nThe equivalent java code would be something like:<p><pre><code>    private final HttpServerRequest req;\n    private final int queries;\n    // INSTEAD OF:\n    //private final List<Object> worlds = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();\n    // HAVE:\n    private final JsonArray worlds = new JsonArray();\n\n        .\n        .\n        .\n\n    @Override\n    public void handle(Message<JsonObject> reply)\n    {\n      final JsonObject body = reply.body;\n\n      if (""ok"".equals(body.getString(""status"")))\n      {\n       // INSTEAD OF:\n       //this.worlds.add(body.getObject(""result""));\n       // HAVE:\n       this.worlds.addObject(body.getObject(""result""));\n      }\n\n      if (this.worlds.size() == this.queries)\n      {\n        // All queries have completed; send the response.\n        // final JsonArray arr = new JsonArray(worlds);\n        try\n        {\n          // INSTEAD OF:\n          //final String result = mapper.writeValueAsString(worlds);\n          // HAVE:\n          final String result = worlds.encode();\n\n          final int contentLength = result.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8).length;\n          this.req.response.putHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/json; charset=UTF-8"");\n          this.req.response.putHeader(""Content-Length"", contentLength);\n          this.req.response.write(result);\n          this.req.response.end();\n        }\n        catch (IOException e)\n        {\n          req.response.statusCode = 500;\n          req.response.end();\n        }\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWith a similar change for Servlets. According to the benchmark results, Onion comes out on top. It's the fastest. But how much of that's because it seems to be written correctly and other tests seem to be written without taking advantage of the same efficiencies.<p>Is it the case here that some people have sent you test code optimized for their own frameworks?<p>If that is so, you should add some tests that would not be so amenable to optimization. I'm not picking on Onion here by the way. In fact, the argument could be made that Onion is not actually 'optimized', so much as just written correctly, and the other frameworks have tests written incorrectly. But I just wanted to know if you guys actually intended to use these different implementations for some reason that I am unaware of? Do they make the tests more fair somehow???",1367525007

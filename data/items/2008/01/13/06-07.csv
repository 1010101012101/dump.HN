Well, as my old boss used to say: ""them"" is ""us"". If <i>you</i> know how to make Rails run, profitably and reliably, on a cheap-ass shared host, go start the business and enjoy your profits. If you don't know, stop assuming that it's because DHH and Ezra Z. are holding out on you. They don't know, either.<p>Rails is all of four years old, and (unlike PHP) was not designed with the explicit goal of supporting shared hosting. I like Rails, and am glad you like it too, but stop expecting miracles.",1200207530

97784,comment,97777,97777,0,0,Shooter,,,"MacHeist groups a bunch of small Mac software publishers together, they each put one application into a discounted bundle, and then they give 25% of all sales to charity.  You get to choose which of 10 charities you support (or you can split the money evenly between them.) A few of the apps are ""locked"" out of the bundle until sales quotas are met.<p>The publishers get extra exposure and incremental sales, the charities get a sizable donation, and the customers get a deal (assuming, of course, that they were going to purchase any of the software titles at full price.)  It's a neat marketing scheme, especially when you factor in the ""Locked"" software aspect which promote a slight viral effect.  I bought the bundle mainly for a new copy of Snapz Pro X, which is still locked...which is approximately 5% of the reason I'm here pimping MacHeist (I said it was viral, dammit!)<p>I doubt this is completely new to most people, but it may serve as a reminder to some.  It may have even been posted here already...?  I personally missed out on last year's bundle because I kept putting it off and then forgot about it until the promo was over.  I thought I might help others avoid the same fate this year.  (I bought my bundle early this year, just in case.)",1200206658

97774,comment,97625,97625,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I think it's important not to confuse OAuth with OpenID. I think OAuth might be very useful indeed, and I'd like to see it succeed. Tying it to the Titanic will not help.<p>I have finally found one clear use case for OpenID: sending out login passwords to newly hired consultants without using cleartext email. Of course, this isn't the kind of killer app that will make OpenID a household word.<p>Among other things, OpenID is: confusing even to geeks, not especially secure, not solving a particularly important problem, an open-ended set of external dependencies on provider code that you do not control, very poorly branded (because, you know, everyone <i>loves</i> having their ID checked), poorly marketed, and often assumed to be something it isn't.<p>From a site developer's standpoint, OpenID solves the wrong problem. Nobody is avoiding your site because they have to remember a password. That requirement hasn't killed eBay, Gmail, Amazon, PayPal, Facebook, Plentyoffish, HotOrNot, news.yc, or any other site in history. Frankly, if people are avoiding your site, it's probably <i>because it sucks</i>. Spend your time making your site suck less.<p>A good way to make your site suck less is to eliminate the need for signups at all, to delay that need as long as possible, or to get the user so excited about the site that they barely notice the signup process. OpenID doesn't do these things. The problem with signups is not the typing, remembering the passwords, or even securing the passwords -- it's the <i>mental overhead</i> associated with deciding whether or not you want another relationship in your life. Can you trust this new site? Will it waste your time? Will it spam you? Will it hit you up for money, forcing you to feel embarassed as you say no over and over? Will your friends find out that you signed up on the site? Will the site plaster your Amazon purchase history all over the open Internet?<p>Signing up for a site is exactly like making a new friend, and if you think it would be great to automatically be friends with everybody in the world, find a recent multimillion-dollar lottery winner and ask them what that's like. Managing your relationships takes thought, attention, and judgement. Nobody's automated that yet.",1200204402

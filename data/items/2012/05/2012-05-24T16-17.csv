Which is often a false premise. Especially for people like me, who simply <i>cannot</i> pay, even if we want to (I don't live in the US, so much of the online content isn't available to me).<p>I agree that not paying sometimes <i>is</i> stealing. E.g. when you don't pay a masseuse/prostituta <i>after</i> they have delivered their service. But, that is a completely different situation (you agreed to a exchange time<-->money, then you essentially broke the contract).<p>Car stealing/copying is the best comparison I could think of. Maybe a better one would be, stealing a car from the company that makes it, vs. building an exact copy at home. The second one might be objectionable (infringing of patents & copyright), but they are most certainly not the same.<p>I hope this clarifies my earlier argument a bit.",1337878782

Particularly, the kind of technical knowledge and interest that allows people to innovate and build on these platforms (as opposed to just turning into consumers).<p>This is where I think the difference between Desktops and Mobile devices stands out on this subject-- Desktops are way more tinkerable and teacher-friendly. I can show someone hands-on how the hardware and software of a desktop computer work together much easier than I could on a mobile device (where are the form factors and modularity?). And I think that makes a big difference in terms of getting people interested in _building_ versus consuming.<p>So as the gap of Internet access narrows in some communities, I see more people embracing tech as consumers and less people understanding or learning about it. Mobile penetration figures are a little misleading because it's not marking close of the Digital Divide as much as just making it look a little different.<p>While I think mobile devices are an excellent way to get previously-unconnected people on the Internet, access is just one of many issues that make up the Digital Divide.

So not a very stable base to base a business on.<p>Node.js is best suited for long-running, evented type web apps (games, chat, interaction etc), so a CMS would not be a good fit.<p>Mongo is also known to lose data, and needs several (3 at least) servers to be somewhat stable with this.<p>A CMS is also not particularly read or write heavy, so a standard DB would fit even better.<p>I assume the data already have some specific form, so the free-form (schema-less) of Mongo doesn't buy much (and you have to replicate some relational-es on top of Mongo anyway, if you want to avoid inefficient queries returning tons of unneeded data with the response that happen to be on the same level in the ""tree"").<p>In a CMS you also have a power-law distribution of read articles, or even worse, with the top page stuff getting the most hits, and older pages being statistical noise. So some caching should provide very good speed with very little memory needs.<p>(Funny aside/rant: once I've implemented a custom CMS for a large bank in my country, with plain ole Java and DB2. The bank people had fallen for some IBM crap, and wanted the backend to be Domino, which, at the time (2003) was, well, let's say, inadequate. Our team implemented a CMS on top of Domino, and, as it naturally was slow as molasses, I convinced them to let us rewrite it in a sane way, which I did by myself in 1/5 the time it took to build the BS Domino version (about 2-3 months). It even had fancy things like being able to have them just upload an Excel file and automatically populating currency rates and stuff from it, with proper Decimal support, fail-rollback, etc).

If the founder can't make enough of a believer out of someone within his or her own network to join, I would see that as a bad sign -- not just in terms of the start-up's idea but also the founder's ability to sell his or her idea. If it's the case that the founder doesn't know viable candidates in his or her own network, then I'd be doubly concerned: it's a tech start-up and a strong network within tech circles will be necessary for other resources down the line (future engineering hires, advice, potential investors that add value to the company, etc). Additionally, if s/he isn't really plugged in to the tech community, I'd worry that s/he doesn't truly understand the business, my skills as it relates to the business, and the value that I bring to the table. And in this particular case, I'd also be concerned that social networking is <i>what this start-up revolves around</i> and the founder (again, from my limited view on the outside) doesn't appear to be able to network effectively enough to at least get introductions to suitable CTO candidates through secondary connections.<p>I'm not saying that this is necessarily the situation here but that's my thought process just based on the information available. I consider things like sales ability, existing network and hiring ability to be essential things for a non-technical founder to bring to the table before I would consider working for him or her -- otherwise, I'm almost as well-off starting my own thing and own a hell of a lot more equity.<p>There are a handful of non-technical people I know that I would join in short order if one of them ever called to talk about a job at his or her start-up. And if I declined I would refer them to other people I know that might be interested because I know no matter what he or she is doing, s/he has a great chance of succeeding. If you're not the kind of person that inspires that level of loyalty, being a lone non-technical founder at a tech start-up seems like it would make an already arduous journey <i>incredibly</i> difficult.",1337877781

Now that blogs and github are so easy to start, why would I want to read that someone has extensive programming experience and good writing skills?  If you do, it'll already be on display.<p>That said... I actually generally get an interview with many of the startups I contact through a traditional resume and cover letter.  I've been hired by some, rejected by others, but I believe it usually comes down to how well I handle a series of difficult technical interviews.  They're usually around algorithms and data structures, and often test recursion.  Threading is also a commonly tested subject.<p>Are these tests highly rigorous?  All I can say is they're pretty tough for me.  I've run the questions by other programmers, some say it's tough, others say it's not so hard, many just get so interested in the problem that they start working on it.<p>Anyway, I'd still say that the best way to get hired by every startup you contact is to be a pretty badass programmer, with a very strong grounding in algorithms and data structures, recursion, threading, and be ready to show you can apply that stuff in a very short amount of time under some pressure at the white board.  It's just my opinion, but I believe I know very, very talented programmers who have been passed over because of their performance during these interviews.<p>Here's something good to take from this blog post - if you are a good and productive programmer who has trouble with the tech grilling, definitely make an effort to put some work out there on blogs and github, it might make the difference.  Maybe the threshold for the technical grilling is more forgiving when the hiring team has more to work with, better examples of a candidate's ability?",1337876435

First you need to connect your computer to the wireless printer. Keep reading for tips on how to connect your printer to your pc.
First of all remember that in order to connect the hardware, both the computer and the printer must be switched on. As the printer is wireless, it will connect to the computer through your Wi-Fi router, so keep the two close to each other.  Also keep metal objects away since they slow your connection and may stop it. 
When you connect your printer to the pc, keep in mind that you still have to configure the printer. This means you first have to install the printer. Usually each printer is provided with a CD-Rom for the installation. So that is your first move, the configuring of your wireless printer.  
If you have the CD-Rom, like most new printer do, insert it in your computer and follow the directions. In case the CD-Rom is not in the package, there is no need to panic as your computer is able to recognize any new hardware and configure it. 
Now that your printer is officially registered on your computer, you can start connecting it to your computer so that you can print from any place in the range of the wireless printer, without having a cable that connects the hardware. 
Assuming you already have a router and Wi-Fi connection, you are not left with much to do. Some printers will let you install the wireless connection when you insert the CD-Rom for the installation of the printer itself. It is likely that during the installation you will be asked the name and password of your network. You can usually find these at the bottom of your router.  
Some wireless printers come with a LCD screen. In this case it will be possible to connect the printer and the computer by following the instructions on the screen. 
If you have no CD-Rom and no LCD screen do not despair, as you can connect your wireless printer and computer manually. Go to the start menu from your desktop and click on control panel and then devices and printers. Once in this section go on Add Printer and then Add wireless Bluetooth and printer. This will allow you to install the driver of your wireless printer and connect it to the computer. 
In some cases a high security level, farewell, might prevent the printer from connecting to the computer through the router. If this happens, youll have to modify the settings of your farewell.",1337876081

Narrow roads and alleys allow for a lot of density without a lot of height. Look at Western Europe to see how they get more density than U.S. cities without sky scrapers.<p>Paris is largely mid-rise buildings or lower. Paris is denser than NYC and not that far behind Manhattan in terms of density (54,000 people per sq mi in Paris versus 71,000 for Manhattan and 27,000 for NYC as a whole). DC density could be greatly raised without taller buildings by filling in missing teeth (abandoned lots of unused buildings on otherwise built streets) and by urbanizing the large swaths of the City that are suburban. Narrowing some streets to allow for wider buildings would also help.<p>Ultimately, I think we'll have to agree to disagree. I don't think elevators or escalators really belong in an urban setting. I do agree that being able to get to a store that you know you want to get to via underground tunnels can have its benefits.

Essentially, it would be too easy for dishonest people to take advantage of it, and too difficult for insurance companies to gather relevant metrics and set a reasonable price.",1337875219

Obviously in any decision (investment or otherwise) there are going to be people on both sides of the issue.<p>The problem is knowing whether to believe them or not.<p>(Like Wanamaker said about advertising, something like ""I know 50% of my ads work but I don't know which 50%"")",1337875218

After hearing about it and trying the demo, I downloaded what I thought was the full copy over a P2P network.<p>The downloaded game behaved like the full copy and contained the first 2 levels as far as I remember. After that came a sequence spoken by the scientist that went a bit like ""Let's be honest. You and I know that this isn't a legal copy and I don't blame you."" and went on about how supporting the developers was important. After that no further levels could be played.<p>Introversion seems to have leaked this version on P2P networks themselves. I bought the full copy a short while later.<p>It's strange that I have yet to find any online sources or Youtube videos about this on the web. I guess no one wants to admit having pirated Darwinia.",1337875212

Many articles that pop up are simply responses to other articles, rarely containing enough content to justify being anything other than a comment.  In this case, I saw the content of this article condensed into a single, well written, concise comments on the article about that guy making $8k off of some Mac OS X app.  Worse, that was an article I found a bit obnoxious in and of itself (it felt hard to justify that as anything other than boasting when I'm fairly certain everyone understands a well promoted sale can do some good.)<p>Closing off that rant and moving on to an actual comment, I don't know that I agree with the 'advice' here.  If you have to hide the fact that your idea is making money out of fear of copy-cats stealing up your business, then it was certainly not a sustainable model to begin with.  It's a good way to make a quick buck and, in that context, this is likely good advice, I just wouldn't count on some project that depended on it to last any meaningful amount of time.",1337875204

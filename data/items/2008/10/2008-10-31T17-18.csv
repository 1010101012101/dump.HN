350162,comment,349889,349998,0,0,jcl,,,"True, it is arbitrage and it is distasteful.  But patent law was designed to encourage the small inventor, which also happens to allow patent trolls to operate; I get the impression that most patents used by trolls are bought from the holdings of failed startups.<p>I do hope the loophole gets closed, but I also hope it gets closed in the right way.  I'm sure the big patent holders (like Microsoft and IBM) would love to eliminate trolls by adding a requirement that a patent holder must be using the patent in a successful product -- with ""successful"" being defined as some suitably large number of units per year.  This would allow big patent holders to effectively ignore patents owned by small players, but not the other way around, which discourages competition and innovation.",1225475879

350158,comment,350002,350032,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I've put some serious thought to the question ""How much is a Facebook account worth?""<p>Clearly, there must be a free account available because it wouldn't be worth a penny if it didn't have as many users as it did. So I re-framed the question as ""What parts of Facebook are worth a premium?"" as well as ""What parts of Facebook would I pay for?""<p>Unfortunately, the list is pretty short. I used to use Facebook a lot during college, but now I use it for the occasional info or photo lookup. When I'm bored waiting/traveling/etc, I will usually whip out my iPhone and comment on a bunch of feed items and that's always worth a few laughs. But would I pay for that? I just really can't see myself needing it badly enough.<p>What ""advanced"" or ""premium"" features do all of you use? What would you pay for those features?",1225475804

350153,comment,350052,350052,0,0,mwerty,,,"A few points:
The transform we use loses color/detail and could be prettier. There are better methods that are less lossy (and more proprietary) but this kinds/sorta works. We'll probably swap out a better one eventually (supporting other colorblindness types).<p>The whole architecture of taking screen shots is very hacky.

I generally like the service they offer (generally, though it is really lacking interesting and helpful aspects) but I've never understood their thinking on business moves.  They've got a very popular software platform, one of the most visited sites in the world and rising, and some how 700 people can't figure out how to make a buck.<p>I agree with most of the other people here... Zuckerberg promises a business plan in 3 years?  What the hell? I can see having your product and company out there and be selling things or providing a service and not necessary have the business plan down and taking some time to find one that really does work well, but when you have 700 people, corporate offices, and a widely popular product/service, a business plan seems to me to be something you put at the front of the line.  Not: ""hmm, we'll get to it later, lets just enjoy the fame!""<p>Most of what goes on at Facebook could be ran by 70 really good people.  That's not including investors/shareholders at all.  That's 70 people that are just in charge, server/network managers, system engineers, accounting (do they need one?), and marketing.  It appears Facebook got the idea that it needed to have its own in-house Microsoft Research or something.",1225475390
350146,comment,349985,350043,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I think what they're doing is daring, but it makes sense. Creating a business plan narrows the companies options; as long as they don't have one, they're flexible enough to bring  in new users (and keep old users coming back), which could open up more possibilities.<p>If Zuck had monetized when Facebook was at Harvard, Facebook would have been cash-flow positive.

I'm taking a class in developing an iPhone application (though I'm not being taught anything, it's more of an experimental independent study), which will count as an upper-level elective.  Sure, I'm also interested in the ""real"" level 400 classes as well, but I can't take those until next Fall!

This can range anywhere from ""this sticks out on the page and can be pushed"" to ""this reminds me of my real desk calendar.""<p>Insofar as the Flat UI concept neglects to create these natural affordances it fails. The only argument one can make that draws upon the current status quo to defend it is if the world has moved on so fast that natural affordances created by depth and shadow can now be made just as effectively to most people by drawing a colored square instead. I'm skeptical that this is true, since three dimensional vision is pretty core to the human experience and human biology.<p>I think what we'll see from Apple will not be an abandonment of skeumorphism in general but instead (in typical Ives fashion) a distilling of it down to its core. Expect depth and shadow, but with a laser-like focus towards using it to create affordances instead of add unnecessary flare. Expect its use to be toned down both in prevalence and also in degree. The cliched example of the leather nav bar has never served any real purpose wrt affordances, so I don't think Apple will be clinging too tightly to it.",1367275543

Suddenly, one day, I got a report from my bank that my card number is among some numbers stolen in USA and they cancelled it. As I only used it with Amazon, I can only conclude that it must have leaked from there. Luckily, I did not lose any money, as the card was blocked by the bank immediately.<p>E-mail addresses are even better. At first I used an email I rarely used for anything else for some 4-5 years. The day I completed my first purchase on Amazon using this e-mail to open an account, was the day I got first spam message on it. And it kept flooding with more and more messages each day. Once it reached about 200+ spams a day, I decided to ditch the address and created a new one for myself and a specific new one on my domain for Amazon exclusively. It was amazn123894@[mydomain]. Anyway, when I got the first order using that e-mail, the same story happened. Now, I don't think hackers have a got a hold on the Amazon servers, it's more probable that you have employees selling the data.

XBLA remove games with lower than 6% conversion rates, and we are supposed to be surprised that their average is higher than in other markets? If XBLA removed anything below 6%, it has the exact definition of selection bias by only allowing the top ranking freemium games a place in the store.<p>This will sound rude, but are you trying to fool others are have you just fooled yourself? Comparing a restricted store which only allow a few marked freemium games, with the PC game market in general is ridicules. The article is about the PC market and PC pirates. Not only is the PC market massive bigger than the total of 588 titles since 2004 that XBLA has, but XBLA has less freemium games per title than the PC market has. They also have a different demographic. A XBLA users is average ages 22, is a causal gamer, and has a middle class income. The average PC pirate age is lower, has less exposable income, and preference more hardcore game.<p>There is no shareable trait between the PC pirate, and the XBLA market. Trying to present the PC market as if its somehow would be the limited selection of XBLA titles is just <i>false</i>.

It's to destroy ""forced focus design"" in favor of ""distraction free design"". In the past we used gradients to aim the eyes towards a direction, shadows to make elements pop out of the page at a viewer, overly rounded corners to seem friendlier to the viewer, etc... We styled elements like this so we could draw attention to certain things and away from others. The same way people wear certain clothing to stand out or fade in with the crowd.<p>However, in this era of instant gratification online property owners not only realized that content is king but that there's too much shit to do and not enough time to do it. They need to give the viewer what they want and give it to as quickly as possible. Confusion breads negative feelings and pissed off viewers leave and don't return. So pages became lighter, more minimal, and lost unnecessary elements, and so designers adjusted to this.<p>By getting rid of the un-needed information on a page we no longer have to draw attention to one thing and away from the other because everything on the page is important. If it wasn't, it shouldn't be there in there in the first place. The buttons don't all need to have massive rounded corners and huge shadows because they're no longer lost in a sea of text and ads. They're easy to spot.<p>This is why you'll notice a lot of Flat UI sites are a lot more minimal than usual.<p>The Flat UI that I HATE is the blocky kind. Minecraft / 8-bit / designer out of college / what the hell's an a/b test inspired extreme flat ui. The kind where you don't know if that's a header with a colored background or a clickable button. The flat ui where everything on the site is so white white white you'd think the owners were clansman. That crap I hate. And it's only a few dozen A/B tests away from disappearing off of prominent sites.<p>I don't think this is ""just a fad"" anymore. There's a reason big companies are switching to it. Microsoft, Apple, Google. They're not stupid. They run A/B tests. They're not going to sacrifice market share, page views, usability, ease-of-use, and their bottom line just to blindly follow a design fad. That's just an insult to them. To say all Flat UI is backwards while the internet's biggest companies convert to it just goes to show how delusional and unknowledgeable we (especially I) can be. I apologize for my past remarks.",1367273000

I can't believe Penn is ranked so highly, outside of Wharton. I was recently there for CS coming from a UK top 5 in CS and Penn CIS was a joke. Also, Oxford > Cambridge for CS? Wat. When you get to about the top 50 universities, it becomes so specific to the strengths of the particular department that these universities really can't be ranked in a single field.",1367272975

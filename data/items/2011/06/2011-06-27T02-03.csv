Maybe it was a real person filling out the recovery form, but I doubt the initial scheme (set up redirecting, send spam mail) was performed by a human. Perhaps the hackers had saved every email in the account and were able to extract the necessary information to do the recovery. But the author admits the Gmail account isn't valuable - the marginal gain from recovering the hacked account seems negligible for the hacker to intervene himself.<p>It seems more plausible that the recovery form has been gamed. The initial hack was programmed to extract the information in advance and possibly even perform the account recovery if necessary. They know exactly what and how much information is needed for Gmail to accept the recovery, whereas the author had to call his s.o. to fill out all the fields.<p>Either way, it sounds like the Gmail recovery form should be revised.

The whole area is filled with vagrants and crackheads.[1] Businesses don't often stay open late. Much of downtown is overrun by tourists, so you have fewer shops that are actually useful to people living there and more shops for the tourists. Groceries are not easy or affordable to come by without driving to one of the surrounding neighborhoods.

More specifically he details how people's behaviour has changed in response to the different environmen, where walking and riding has been made more accessible and safer (for instance bike lanes on the inside of parked cars, so the cars protect the bike lane from the street), more people end up walking and riding.<p>Now suburbia has pretty much been designed for cars rather than people, and as such it is no real wonder that you have to drive everywhere rather than cycling or walking.<p>It should be possible to change this suburbia to something less car friendly, perhaps in cities like Detroit and others, which are in the process of removing suburbs entirely (or so I have read), so that people's behaviour changes. However I don't see this happening easily in the USA. People will relinquish their suburbs, cars, SUV's only when pried from their cold dead hands.",1309141605

Sure, the (current) higher stick price of hybrid / electric cars means that cities will become more attractive at the margin, but given how easy the substitutes are, I think electric cars (and the infrastructure necessary to run them) are now advanced enough to ensure that oil prices alone won't damn suburbs.",1309140157

2699789,comment,2698628,2698628,1,0,jonmc12,,,"I'm not sure it is a sound argument because most of the valuations in question are being set by private and institutional investors.  So, the evidence of this phase of the bubble (as measured in the Blank paradigm) would be a survey of the sentiment of the smaller subset of individuals who set valuations for companies - not the population as a whole.<p>Perhaps this is a nuance of the simplified model Blank presented (in the sense that every model is wrong).  However, in my mind, it actually supports the Blank argument that a small set of private investors are effectively trying to create an investment that the public views as 'the opportunity of a lifetime'.<p>In other words, the Horowitz's argument is exploiting the holes in Blank's argument to divert from the obvious fact that we live in a cycle where it is clearly in the interest of every early-stage, private investor to be optimistic about valuations because they have a very good track record selling their story a greater fool in current market conditions.<p>Falling prices of public stocks (linkedin, pandora) is evidence that sellers have run out of greater fools for the moment.  However, the IPO price itself is largely a function of the valuation private investors can convince the institutional investors to buy at and the <i>initial</i> sentiment the can market to the public (so in this case its the average sentiment of only the eager set of initial public investors).<p>I think this IPO price, and the funding rounds leading up to the IPO are of most interest.  Further, I think the sentiment of the subset of the public involved in these investments is what Blank is talking about.  And, I think Horowitz knows that, and is merely trying to deflect the debate in a direction that takes it away from looking like the insider-driven system that it is.",1309140130

It claims only 10% of the actual cost is covered by taxes.

Compare the 30% fat American Heart Association diet to the Dr. Dean Ornish, Dr. McDougall, or Dr. Esselstyn diets that recommend 10% fat and whole foods, not products marketed as 'low fat' snacks and meals.   The latter diets are clinically shown to reverse heart disease, essentially heal Type II diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and many other diseases.  There is ongoing research by McDougall into multiple sclerosis, based on past great success with the low fat Swank diet.<p>The standard dietary advice is given largely because people can't make enough changes to even follow that, much less make the effort to have every single meal conform to something as seemingly 'radical' as a 10% fat diet.<p>So yes, arn, ""doctors recommend diet and exercise all the time"", but it's not to the extent necessary to bring about meaningful results.<p>But carry on with your dismissal of anything that doesn't make you feel good (mentally, physically, or morally) as ""tin foil conspiracies"".

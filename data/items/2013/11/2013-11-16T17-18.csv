With a free account you can backup data to another computer (yours or a friend&#x27;s). With a paid account you can backup to their cloud storage and you can get more things to tweak. You can provide your own encryption keys, so the data should be safer (as long as you don&#x27;t loose the private key). The best thing is that it offers file versioning (even with a free account, but you don&#x27;t get some of the advanced settings for that), so if something really bad happens - like a ransomware virus, that encrypts your files - you can still recover the older version. The only issue is that the application needs Internet access even when using it locally - so if something happens to your account, or you don&#x27;t have Internet access, you cannot easily[1] access your data.<p>[1] <a href=""http://crashplan.probackup.nl/remote-backup/support/q/how-to-restore-from-local-crashplan-backups-without-internet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crashplan.probackup.nl/remote-backup/support/q/how-to...</a>",1384624700

Such as, speeding well above what classifies as reckless driving or driving sufficiently intoxicated. I think the reasoning is that if one were to kill someone under those circumstances it would be manslaughter, and any reasonable person would know that excessive speeding or driving drunk carries a high risk of killing someone even though that person isn&#x27;t exactly trying to kill anyone, therefore, even though they didn&#x27;t kill someone, they still basically attempted to in being so careless. IOW, you really should be charged with manslaughter, you just were lucky enough to have no actually killed anyway<p>> I think different jurisdictions probably punish those actions similarly, they just may call it something other than attempted manslaughter, like maybe reckless endangerment or whatever.<p>Reckless endangerment - I admit that strikes me as a better term, although I now understand the reasoning behind &quot;attempted manslaughter&quot;.",1384624542

The OP seemed to encourage such behaviour, even admitted it was &quot;crap&quot; they were selling (it is).<p>I&#x27;d suggest that any startup worth its salt is actually offering something of real value, not explicitly a charity case, so the analogy completely breaks down. I fully support encouraging the startup ecosystem.<p>And I&#x27;m not even sure about using a term like &quot;top down&quot;. Hotels really do employ locals, as do restaurants, and by patronising them you send a strong signal of support to the local tourism industry.

Afaik, in the EU currently, only Austria sort-of has one, and it&#x27;s not explicit. Like many countries, Austria can grant special-case citizenship to people who&#x27;ve rendered extraordinary services to Austria, but unlike most other countries, this includes not only scientific achievement and the like, but also a handful of very rich people each year, who negotiate through intermediaries a grant of citizenship in return for either a large donation, or a large investment.

Obviously, its major strength is its &quot;real-time&quot;[0] nature: I have built multiple chat systems (and presumably so has anyone else who&#x27;s used Meteor, because it&#x27;s an example of something that&#x27;s fun and easy with Meteor but relatively hard with a traditional stack) as well as a map application that tracked the motion of a company&#x27;s employees in relation to their destination (as part of a dispatching system).<p>1. It&#x27;s also the least complicated way of sharing code between the browser and the server that I&#x27;ve seen to date.<p><i>Cons:</i><p>0. It&#x27;s non-npm package manager feels like NIH to me (although I&#x27;m sure the team had valid reasons, I&#x27;ve never looked into it). Apparently it&#x27;s still possible to require npm modules[1], although I&#x27;ve never tried it.<p>1. You&#x27;re more or less stuck with MongoDB for the time being, which I guess a lot of people like but it&#x27;s not really my thing.<p>2. There&#x27;s not really any SEO capability, but that&#x27;s sort of a given. Just don&#x27;t use Javascript frameworks for that sort of project (or do, and do all sorts of weird shit to help Google).<p>3. It&#x27;s kind of too auto-magic for me sometimes. The documentation is generally very good, but I occasionally run into weird variable scoping issues and the like, without any way of really figuring out what&#x27;s happening. Of course, the source code is available[2] if I had time to read it. (Well-written, but big, and I find reading Node code to be mentally more taxing because of all the callbacks.)<p>4. The biggest con, for me, is that Meteor is basically limited to web applications. I really enjoy the typical single-page web app approach of building an API first, which you can access from other apps later (ie. mobile/tablet). I have no idea how I&#x27;d do that with Meteor. I&#x27;m experimenting with bundling a Meteor project and inserting the client-side code into a Phonegap app, for a mobile chat thing I&#x27;m working on, but that&#x27;s obviously not ideal.<p>Generally, I love working with Meteor. I know I&#x27;ve written more cons than pros, but the pros I&#x27;ve listed are <i>huge</i>, and they&#x27;ve allowed me to work on cool stuff.

My point was that LG used to stand for &#x27;Lucky Goldstar&#x27;. Now, it is the actual name. QANTAS used to stand for &#x27;Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services&#x27;. Now, it is the actual name. In the same vein, Mt. Gox used to stand for &#x27;Magic the Gathering Online Exchange&#x27;. Now, it is the actual name.<p>Further to that, you referred to the site as &#x27;the magic the gathering online exchange&#x27;.

You cannot deny that they pivoted from exchanging MtG cards to exchanging Bitcoins, and calling it something that it obviously is not anymore is wrong.<p>Finally, when you said that &quot;when you try to withdraw funds you are prevented from doing so and put on a waiting list&quot; that is not correct. You are not prevented from doing so. Your request is processed and queued... just because that queue takes way too long for a lot of people doesn&#x27;t mean it was prevented.

Gox in particular that are worrying. However, I would point to those things instead of mentioning things that actually aren&#x27;t true.

It uses the IE WebBrowser control via ActiveX/COM/.Net/however the hell it works. Its basically IE but slightly shittier due to there not being a 1:1 between it and IE proper. SiteKiosk has some pretty powerful digital signage features you don&#x27;t really get from a Windows Embedded scenario. One feature of 8.1 I was looking forward to was &quot;kiosk mode&quot; but with WinRT being blocked from talking to localhost, except through a hack (yes, fuck you Microsoft) it was stillborn for my tastes.<p>.NET apps are ClickOnce or xbap, which is basically pre-Silverlight. This is the suckiest part. SiteKiosk can run normal applications and Silverlight with no problems but it took SL 5 to get proper COM support and it isn&#x27;t terribly easy to make your normal .NET library &quot;just work&quot; so that wrapper for a card dispenser isn&#x27;t as easy to leverage. Due to the low number of these apps (2), we haven&#x27;t bothered migrating away from shitty xbap.<p>The largest amount of applications use typical wamp running a lightweight PHP framework and sometimes MySQL as localhost. Some are completely or partially Flash driven applications as well.<p>SiteKiosk and leveraging IE lets us focus on perfecting the experience though I&#x27;ve become complacent. IE development is just too slow now and testing in Chrome with superior dev tools are absolutely essential. The problem there is we can easily paint ourselves into a Chrome-only corner if we aren&#x27;t careful.<p>Leveraging the POS equipment like barcode readers, card dispensers, or printers are the only thing the web proper isn&#x27;t really suited for unfortunately. This may be where Windows has much more leverage due to their driver model. Most equipment we interfaced with had a .NET library or simple instructions of use with P/Invoke. I saw very little (<1%) that had anything to do with Linux and in typical fashion wasn&#x27;t something to simply use via something like PHP or Ruby/Rails.

It was an extremely good (and common) trade for a NGO.  For example, the cost of holding an art show generally pays dividends in getting money to teach more artists.

R isn&#x27;t just a programming language, but it&#x27;s a software framework/ecosystem.  They mentioned this in the slides, but it&#x27;s problematic because R <i>crucially</i> relies on C and Fortran interaction (which I thought the JVM can&#x27;t do efficiently, since it doesn&#x27;t like giving C/Fortran raw memory access to its internals).  Decades of work has gone into highly optimized Fortran linear algebra libraries, for example -- which R and all the other high-level numerical languages (NumPy/SciPy, Matlab, Julia) use.  And many of the CRAN packages (the availability of which are a major reason anyone uses R in the first place) are partly or mostly C/Fortran code.<p>There are many other R implementation efforts going on right now -- Radford Neal lists a few (as well as his own) here: <a href=""http://radfordneal.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/deferred-evaluation-in-renjin-riposte-and-pqr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radfordneal.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/deferred-evaluat...</a><p>The presentation focuses on the R programming language, which they nicely show has all sorts of misfeatures that impede rapid execution.  If you&#x27;re going to not try to have compatibility with R and CRAN, you might as well start from scratch with design and performance in mind, as in Julia: <a href=""http://julialang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julialang.org/</a>",1384621703

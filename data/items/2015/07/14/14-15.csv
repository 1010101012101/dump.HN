9885368,comment,9884345,9884345,0,0,moron4hire,,,"I don&#x27;t know enough about this particular hardware to know. I know when I was tested for sleep apnea, the CPAP machine they suggested for me was set on a very low flow rate. A number of factors contribute to the airway obstruction in sleep apnea. One is muscle tone in the airway: too flimsy of muscle will collapse more easily. One is body fat: too much and it squeezes everything closer. One is airflow itself: if the airway is constricted just enough to create a thin slit, the airflow through it will reduce the air pressure and close it the rest of the way. Snoring is thus essentially the same phenomenon as how reed instruments produce sound. So, the idea with a CPAP machine is not to force air into your longs, it&#x27;s to create enough positive pressure inside the airway to open it again and let your own lungs do the bulk of the work thereafter.<p>But they are <i>extremely</i> intrusive to sleep, especially if you have a partner. A better CPAP machine <i>is</i> needed. But I won&#x27;t give them pre-order money, more because I&#x27;ve seen way too many bad crowd-sourcing projects than out of specific concerns towards this project.<p>For $3 I&#x27;ll buy it on a whim and try it out. I&#x27;d try a larger one that was significantly smaller than a standard CPAP for $20, maybe even $50.<p>But whether or not the project is legit is kind of beside the point to me right now. Having done a lot of prototyping of my own, in both software <i>and</i> hardware, it bothers me to see people jump directly to crowdfunding before they&#x27;ve even built a hot-glue-and-wires version of a prototype. Prove the concept. It&#x27;s not that freaking hard.<p>All they say they&#x27;ve done is built the shell of the noseplug. They haven&#x27;t any idea how to get the electronics on the inside. Their FAQ page makes it sound like their understanding of cutting edge electronics comes from Popular Mechanics, or Boing Boing.<p>People act like hardware is so extra-special hard. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s no more or less difficult than hacking on software in your free time. The actual, core functionality of your project, whether it&#x27;s hardware or software, should be possible to validate in less than a month. The rest of what it takes to turn any project into a real product will far eclipse the proof-of-concept work in the level of effort necessary. There&#x27;s no such thing as &quot;if you build it, they will come&quot;.<p>Okay, no, Elon Musk&#x27;s Hyperloop can&#x27;t be validated in a month. A brand-new, hyper-secure, microkernel operating system written in Rust wouldn&#x27;t be, either. I&#x27;m not saying <i>all</i> ideas are possible in a month, I&#x27;m just saying the stuff people typically do in the given spaces as garage inventors <i>are</i> on the short-scale for validation.<p>It just takes up a little to a lot more space. But if you&#x27;re dedicated, most people can find the space. I&#x27;m sure a few adults like supposedly involved in this project can rent out a small warehouse on their pocket cash together. I don&#x27;t even work full-time, I live in one of the worst areas of the country for real estate prices right now, and even <i>I</i> could scrap together the money for a small warehouse, if I had to.<p>It&#x27;s going to be hard if you don&#x27;t have any experience in hardware. Yeah, but even making a simple CRUD app is going to be hard if you don&#x27;t have any experience in software. We live in a golden age of hardware development. Nearly everyone and their neighbor in the US has a garage full of tools that could bootstrap a small industrial renaissance in a 3rd world country.<p>Or you don&#x27;t even have to buy anything, design a flat-pack vector layout in Inkscape, email it to any of the thousands of laser-cutting services in the country, tell them you&#x27;re fine buying scrap material, wait a couple of days, and you can make anything the size of a breadbox for about $50.<p>Need more complexity? Make a 3D model in blender, send it off to any of the dozens of (and growing) 3D printing services, wait a couple of days, and you can make anything the size of an old Walkman for about $50. Seriously, don&#x27;t buy your own 3D printer unless you want to get into the business of maintaining 3D printers. Outsource that malarky.<p>But come on, if you don&#x27;t believe in your project enough to put your own time and money into it, how do you expect us to believe in it? (though, I know that isn&#x27;t really stopping anyone).",1436885972

Instead of being a critic and combating every form of feature that somehow you dislike. Try to see how partnerships and opportunities make things better for everyone.Lots of people are loving the Pocket and Hello features and using them on a daily basis.

But he said that we need to study the New Horizons data for some years, to better design the next mission. At this time, they wouldn&#x27;t know what the best instruments to send would be. Also, it is far from clear how to send a mission to Pluto that takes a reasonable amount of time to get there (9 years, in the case of New Horizons) but can also stop when it gets there. Cassini took almost seven years to reach Saturn and the orbital insertion burn was something like ninety minutes!

Content with higher interaction counts may have a 4.5 star rating and shows below content with 5 stars and lower interactions, even though it is probably the better choice.<p>In our app we show a list of content (in our case Nightclubs) and allow users to sort based on 3 properties: Name, Rating, Favorite count. Name is self explanatory, it&#x27;s just alphabetical ascending. Favorite count is also self explanatory, think of it as a like count and we sort descending. Rating is where it get&#x27;s interesting... I&#x27;m looking for a fair &quot;score&quot; to rate venues on instead of simply rating. The problem with rating is venues that have more bookings are naturally going to have ratings below 5 stars. Our best venues with 100&#x27;s of bookings have a rating around 4.6. This is a problem because most of our users are choosing to sort by rating, but those 4.6 rated venues with a ton of buyers are being shown below venues with minimal buyers that happen to have a 5 star rating. So my question, is there a fair algorithm that can take into account buy counts and rating to sort more naturally?",1436885640

Given these facts, there is little reason to assume that browsers will inherently be more secure just because plug-ins were forced out in favour of native technologies. As others have been pointing out today, the reverse might actually be true, because at least the plug-ins have a degree of isolation and click-to-play safeguards are now widespread, while the trend with browsers (again, particularly Firefox and Chrome) is to remove obvious settings that would allow users to turn off certain functions.",1436885516

Air weighs about 1.2 gm/l = 2.88 KG moved in an an 8 hour period.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this device is plausible, but I know this calculation is not useful. You&#x27;re calculating the mass of air moved, which, first of all, does not itself say much about the energy required to do so; for instance, horizontal motion doesn&#x27;t require any net energy (though any real device doing so will of course need to do something to accelerate and decelerate, there&#x27;s nothing to say it can&#x27;t be very, very cheap). Second you appear to be discussing it as if there isn&#x27;t a pair of lungs right there providing motive power. I do that much moving of the air every day (plus a bit, probably, I&#x27;m a tall guy) with no batteries at all.<p>This thing is not responsible for &quot;moving all that air&quot;... it&#x27;s responsible for a <i>pressure increase</i> of the air, which is at least somewhat equivalent to saying it&#x27;s responsible for &quot;moving air&quot; but only a fraction of the value you computed. They say it is supposed to do from 1 to 20 &quot;centimeters of water&quot;. According to the Great and Mighty Internet, 20 cmH20 is 0.02 atmospheres, just to give some perspective. I do not have the math to calculate the energy requirement that represents when the air is in motion itself; my physics would only be sufficient to calculate the energy implied in pressurizing a closed container from 1 to 1.02 atmospheres, which is useless in this case. Perhaps someone else can pop up for that.<p>(Bear in mind I took a full standard College physics-for-non-majors course set, using full calculus, and what I know from that is that what I know is inadequate... if that also describes your experience, your education is inadequate too. We&#x27;re going to need to hear from someone with more specialized education.)<p>My suspicion is that yes, this device <i>is</i> plausible, but the final version is going to be larger than the versions shown. Whether it crosses over the invisible line where people become unwilling to wear it is anybody&#x27;s guess, but... sleep apnea <i>sucks</i> and those masks do suck too, so there&#x27;s some room for these guys to work in.

This may be in the table of contents, introduction, index, chapter sections, or subsections. I generally scan the text as fast as possible to find all the essential points of interest, marking them down for future reference. What I do after this point is likely different than most. As every text I read is digitally formatted, I don&#x27;t actually try to remember or deeply understand much at all on my second pass through the material. Instead, I will open a text editor and copy and paste the passages that strike me as most essential, retaining as much context as necessary to retain the original meaning. On my third pass, I will restructure the extracted content, cutting out the redundant parts, re-mixing, or re-expressing them until each chunk I want to remember is accessible and concise. This completes what I&#x27;d call the conceptual phase of my reading, which takes a fraction of the time it would take if I were attempting to understand the work using a more linear or comprehensive approach.<p>There is still much I don&#x27;t understand at this point. This is natural since I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to apply the information to a personally meaningful context. This is the point at which I begin the practical phase. As most of what I need to know is documented in my notes, I will keep it on hand as a memory queue as I engage with specific questions or problems that interest me. And so when an issue comes up that I can&#x27;t settle, I refer to the notes and also search around online to find out how I should apply the content in that particular problem situation. It&#x27;s over the course of this process that I internalize the most vital details. That&#x27;s where the learning happens, at least for me.<p>Another advantage to this approach is that you will have a type of mnemonic device to reboot your knowledge. As most people forget practically everything shortly after moving on to new subjects, it&#x27;s critical to have a way to index the information you don&#x27;t want to forget in the future.

Then again, what do they get?  Infrastructure is non-existent (roads are all gravel or dirt, power is on about 50% of the time, no potable running water, police are non-existent, etc...).  This is the conundrum of development economics - how do you go from this stage of development, to a new stage where people pay taxes so the government can provide services?  With no services people will avoid taxes, with no tax money the government cannot provide services.  The answer of course, is that it&#x27;s difficult and takes time.<p>Corruption is an easier problem to solve, but difficult to implement.  To get civil servants to stop accepting bribes you need to pay them enough that losing their pay is actually a punishment, or punish them enough that the threat of jail time counters the benefit of accepting bribes (or ideally, a bit of both).<p>Anyhow, neither problem can be solved in the amount of time that the troika has expected Greece to solve them - and they ARE economic problems, not moral ones.",1436884715

When there was serious threat about Iran regime existence , they negotiate , and they accept what they called 10 years ago a traitor would do.<p>They just love money.And they only weapon they have for keeping people in iran busy and afraid of any kind of protest, is &quot;imaginary&quot; enemy.That&#x27;s all.<p>I cannot find the exact link . But I read a DoD Analysis about Iran , and the first paragraph they mentioned was this : &quot;Iran regime only care about himself&quot; (meaning of the first paragraph) .<p>As Iranian I can assure you , They don&#x27;t even care even about Israel/Palestine.They just need imaginary enemy keeping people in scared position.<p>p.s. sorry for my broken English.<p>p.s-2: Yes I know and accept this is so simplistic, we have all kind of majority in our society , but If you see the level of corruption in our economy , You will understand nothing can stand against money.Not even supreme leader.At the end at least in my view (I served in high-level military base in my mandatory military service_sadly was two year waste of my life), at the very end alls boils down to money and keeping regime safe.

See, for instance, page 12 here [1] (the titles of his talks all seem to be provocative questions; almost in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way).<p>One of the problems (in my opinion) with networks is that the analysis has always been post hoc. Personally, I think it&#x27;s more preferable to build a method starting from theory [2] which can then be tested empirically to see if the assumptions of the theory hold. Then augment the theory, the method, and experiment again.<p>Now, there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with post hoc analysis - it&#x27;s just a different start point in the loop of science. However, because we didn&#x27;t start from theory, the burden is then to extract some theory from empirical observation. Again IMO, this is can be problematic because:<p>1) It more easily allows for confirmation bias.<p>2) It leads to a multitude fragmented theories.<p>The second is why everything surrounding neural networks seems so incredibly ad hoc.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.cs.nyu.edu/~yann/talks/lecun-20071207-nonconvex.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.nyu.edu/~yann/talks/lecun-20071207-nonconvex....</a><p>[2]: The principles could be based on statistical learning (see SVM), neurophysiology (see work by Poggio or Olshausen), mathematical invariants (see work by Mallat), etc...",1436883757

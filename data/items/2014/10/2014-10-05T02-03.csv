I am on H1B in US and live in Boston area.  I am wondering if I am being underpaid ?\nI have near seven years of experience and earn close to ( but less than ) $80K / annum.\nI would describe myself as fairly good though not expert in software development. I actively code and lead team of two developers. I am heavily involved in data platform engineering applications and possess good knowledge of many technologies.<p>My company employs lots of people on H1B visa ( nearly ~30 % population ). I constantly see stories on how people starting their jobs are getting $90K and on. \nI understand SF, NY are highly expensive areas so adding more $20k make sense but still Boston itself is very expensive city to live.<p>I am a bit shy and probably worst negotiator. Last year when I changed job I even did not counter the offer ( I feel bad though ! )\nI read this post https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8409020 and see people are at least earning $50 to $60 per hour ( roughly $130K or more ) and now wondering should I change from direct employment to consulting gig ? \nOne of challenge I know as of now in going for consulting is , my network is very weak. I am less social person and know very limited number of people in US.<p>I am 29 years old and might soon start a family. So not sure if consulting is way to go if you have family. I would like to know from you if I am being underpaid being on H1B.<p>Any pointers to improve myself both in terms of earning and negotiation will also be helpful.\nSorry for throwaway account and Thank you for taking the time to read the post.<p>Cheers ,<p>Fellow HN reader",1412477435
8411310,comment,8408501,8408501,1,0,agibsonccc,,,"I&#x27;d like to add something to the discussion wrt network architectures and representations of neural net parameters. Neural nets when being trained can be packed up as one parameter vector to represent this same structure. In fact, this is how a lot of linear optimizers train neural networks. To demonstrate a quick example:<p>A typical neural net layer is made up of a weight matrix W and a bias vector. This represents the connections of the network.<p>A typical feed forward architecture will have a weight matrix of number of inputs x number of outputs with a bias equal to the number of outputs.<p>Say: W is a 3 x 2 with a bias of 2. We can then represent a neural net parameter space as an 8 length vector.<p>The only the the neural net needs to know how to do is &quot;unpack&quot; the parameters to retain the layer structure. I actually do this in deeplearning4j for training the weights and putting them in to a search algorithm.<p>You would then repeat this for however many layers you have in your network going in order to the output layer.<p>Anyways: the reason deep architectures are used with more &quot;learning&quot; capacity is due to being able to intermix different kinds of activations. A typical example of this is a deep belief network where you have an initial layer that takes in continuous data and then the activations change it to binary.<p>It really depends on the problem you&#x27;re solving as to whether this is relevant or not.<p>Just a neat thought. Anyways great paper!",1412477431

8411299,comment,8409994,8411142,1,0,meowface,,,"Are you suggesting that morality has no purpose other than to provide a civilized society? That&#x27;s one view on morality, but it&#x27;s not that common nowadays.<p>To suggest that you shouldn&#x27;t harm a neighbor solely so that others won&#x27;t harm you is a very selfish proposition. This is an anemic view on morality and altruism in any modern society. From an evolutionary standpoint, altruism and morality serve merely as constructs and contracts to enable a functioning society, but from a psychological standpoint they&#x27;re something far greater.<p>>The reason certain behaviours are considered moral/ ethical and are set as a standard is to make sure we (human) can have a reasonable life among one another, and not because the behaviour itself is intrinsically good.<p>Ok, then what happens if you decide a certain person or certain group no longer reasonably belongs in the category of &quot;one another&quot;? For example, how some Sunnis view Shiites, and how Hutus view Tutsis. That group is no longer seen as a vital part of civilization and can be treated in any way at all, because behavior cannot be intrinsically good or bad.<p>>I think the main point I&#x27;m trying to make is that I&#x27;d love to see a concrete philosophical explanation on many of vegan-related stuffs.<p>If you want one example of such a philosophical explanation, look at utilitarianism. There are countless other moral philosophies which can be used to argue that &quot;intrinsically good&quot; behavior is a thing to strive for, even if it may be applied with certain nuances.<p>It may be debatable whether moral vegetarianism actually has the desired effect of a utilitarian standpoint (not eating meat may not necessarily reduce the number of animals killed each year for food), but it is ludicrous to argue that morality plays no role in a vegetarian or vegan&#x27;s desired end goal of reducing animal suffering and death.",1412477121

I think that the article&#x27;s point about online security is a healthy reminder for many Hacker News readers:<p>&quot;The seven persuasion principles might be as old as the hills, but Stajano says they are often ignored by security experts, who are as likely to blame security breaches on the people using their systems as they are to blame the scammers. &#x27;Too many security professionals think: users are such a pain – my system would be super-secure if only users behaved in the proper way,&#x27; he says. He is trying to persuade experts that they need to make security systems that work in harmony with – not despite - the way we behave.&quot;<p>We have to deal with human nature as it is, not as we wish it to be, if we are to make progress in computer and Internet security.",1412475807

Find a few applications for things in the region of your invention in the last few years and look at the patent documents. You&#x27;ll see the names of the patent attorneys in the filing info. Contact them and ask them this question. If you can find the IPC code for your idea look at maybe 20 sets of metadata and look for similarities - some patent attorneys have specialisms.<p>Eg, <a href=""https://register.epo.org/application?number=EP13189587"" rel=""nofollow"">https://register.epo.org/application?number=EP13189587</a> has BWT as their representative.<p>If you find the quoted prices too high and your offers of lower amounts are rebuffed then ask again here stating the offers you were given.<p>Ultimately you can submit a complete disclosure of your invention and then mould the actual application later so if you&#x27;re doing this as a prelude to seeking funding then that is probably the cheapest way to go.

2644535,comment,2641099,2643472,2,0,Tycho,,,"If Curtis' latest documentary series was a courtcase, the defense would be going blue in the face shouting 'objection!' after virtually every line and the judge would likely just make a sign saying 'sustained' to hold up. Almost every assertion/connection he makes or insinuates is logically untenable. Consider the whole leap from 'some' Silicon Valley entrepreneurs following Rand, to the NY/London financial industry putting too much faith in computers. Or the supposed direness westernisation has brought about in south-east Asia - focussing on a single crisis and ignoring the broader picture. Or statements he makes about things so long passed that they somehow shouldn't need evidence, eg. the great depression 'was caused by greed.'<p>Basically he picks a bunch of ideas or voices, arbitrarily decides they had utmost influence on history, giving no evidence for this, then connects them to cherry-picked historical events, omitting any events that would contradict the narrative he wants to present, and also any counterpoints within the ideologies he's 'debunking.' If anyone seriously finishes watching those shows and takes it all at face value, they have some serious epistemological issues.<p>Was Rand happy? Think how ridiculous this is: all the stuff she accomplished in her life time, and the documentary focuses on one spell of unhappiness stemming from a personal betrayal, to paint her as a 'failed invidividual.' Think of all the difficulties other philosophers/writers ran into - yet we let their ideas stand on their own merit. Of course Rand was not happy every single day, and there's nothing about her philosophy that suggests she ought to have been, but she was (rightly) satisfied with her life.",1307818788
2644534,comment,2643671,2644114,1,0,beej71,,,"Even though a variety of hardware makers already do this with Linux, it's a different situation than with OSX.  Apple can really dictate what goes where in the hardware, but Dell etc. are all buying the latest, greatest, and most cost effective hardware out there.<p>And since makers of that hardware, and makers of software for that hardware, are so keen to have their stuff work with Windows, they do most of the heavy lifting, leaving Dell etc to package stuff up and ship it out the door.<p>So while Dell etc might bust its ass getting a few Linux-based SKUs out there, they're going to have to keep up the hard work making sure it runs on the newest hardware, when the hardware manufacturers rarely care if Linux runs on their stuff at all.  And as anyone who has installed Linux on brand new hardware knows, hiccups are not uncommon.<p>The balance of power difference is that with Windows, everyone else works hard to make sure their stuff works with Windows.  With Linux, Linux devs work hard to make sure their stuff works with everyone else.  And Apple just has to work well with Apple and their few suppliers.<p>Linux does hit a lot closer to the Windows model with Android, however.",1307818738

But after doing, I've learned that it's really not a great way to discover unique experiences.

2644527,comment,2644349,2644506,2,0,civilian,,,"The idea is the angle of it.  If I have an intensely bright spotlight (on, say, a satallite?), and I make it spin 360 degrees in a second, then somewhere out in space the trail of light is going faster than the speed of light.<p>You can also think about the beacon that a pulsar gives off. We can detect the pulses happening every few seconds-- so what happens when our friend on Alpha Centauri also detects the pulses?  The pulsar 'spotlight' is cycling between Alpha Centauri & Earth in a fraction of a second, even though we're 4 lightyears away from eachother.<p>It's not really FTL, only from a certain point of view.  As the author says: ""These are all examples of things that can go faster than light, but which are not physical objects.  It is not possible to send information faster than light on a shadow or light spot, so FTL communication is not possible in this way.  This is not what we mean by faster than light travel, although it shows how difficult it is to define what we really do mean by faster than light travel.""",1307818501
2644526,comment,2643671,2644128,10,0,dkarl,,,"GNOME and KDE are monolithic and encourage everything under their umbrellas to depend on everything else.  The Linux desktop has fallen into the same pitfall that so many enterprises do:  reaction against integration issues in a chaotic environment has led to monolithic approaches that provide uniformity and integration but prevent the mix-and-match flexibility that allows individual projects to fail and succeed on their merits.  The monolithic approach, the architecture astronaut approach, means high commitment to each project and leads to projects like PulseAudio becoming ""too big to fail"" even if they fail at their technical objectives.  The next step in evolution is supposed to be a loosely coupled services architecture that provides the best of those two worlds.  I won't venture to guess where it goes after that.",1307818500

I use it, Acorn, and Photoshop Elements. I would really like to get off the Adobe bandwagon since Elements has insidiously overbearing DRM where you get two installs and you lose an install permanently every time your hard drive goes down, so that you weren't able to delicense first. So I had Elements installed on my laptop and my desktop and when the laptop's  drive kicked the bucket, then I was down to one activation and could no longer use it on the laptop without buying it again. This is annoying and it is not how my hammer works. My hammer works whether or not my hard drive has gone down. It's also not how a lot of other software works. But it is how some works.<p>So Pixelmator has the Apple Store thing. One install only, so none of this nonsense of installing on laptop and desktop even though both are used by the same single person who never uses both at once. However, if the harddrive goes down, there is some way to get the license back, delicensing is not necessary first.<p>But in any case I don't want to buy Apple Store stuff because I don't want my machine ID tied to my credit card number with Apple. Apple is doing too much privacy invading and I want nothing to do with it. If others want that fine.<p>So Pixelmator 2 will be Apple store only, and no upgrade price for loyal Pixelmator 1 users.<p>So that's it. Not upgrading and not recommending it to anyone.<p>That leaves Acorn and Gimp.<p>Photoshop is hands down a better program than anything else, but the last few years it seems most of their time has been spent on DRM. Photoshop is constantly trying to connect to the internet, which it has absolutely no legitimate reason that benefits the customer to be doing. Programs that connect to the internet that have no reason to are intrinsically suspicious.<p>I can see more of the value proposition for open source because of all this DRM stuff.<p>I pay for all my software. I am the good customer. But over the top DRM is driving me to alternatives, forcing me to have to use open source solutions instead even if I'd rather have something that's a little more polished like a commercial product.<p>Oh well. I am fine using the alternatives. It's interesting to me though that companies would do this. Such as take an app, pull it from distribution unless you lock your hardware to a credit card at an Apple store. Why would I want to do that just to use a image editing app?<p>Sure for many people this is no big deal. They don't care about privacy or fair use of things they have bought.

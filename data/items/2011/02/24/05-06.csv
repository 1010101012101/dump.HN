I've taught Perl 5 professionally, and while I certainly do acknowledge that Perl isn't optimal for learning, ""inconsistent grammar"" is not on my list.  It does have a more-complex grammar than, say, lisp, but it's still an extremely consistent grammar, as far as I've been able to tell.<p>I also disagree with the claim that a large vocabulary in Perl is a notable issue.  The size of the Perl grammar and language is sufficiently smaller, in my experience, than the size of all of the library APIs that I have to deal with when writing Perl programs.",1298527055

It doesn't make sense, why would you want to do that, when all you want to do is write one or two blog posts in a year? Phrot is a very community centric site to blog with. It's designed for the person that wants to write about something, and wants it to be read, but doesn't want to have to go through all the hassle of promoting it.<p>This isn't designed to replace other blogging platforms like wordpress, just to provide a more suitable alternative for people who want to do things a bit differently.

These systems have worked well, cutting spam by 95% last year alone.<p>In this particular case, Breakup Notifier triggered one of our automated systems due to an excessive number of negative user reports. The system automatically shuts down access to the app while immediately notifying the developer via email; which is exactly what happened for Breakup Notifier. We take this action to preserve the user experience while giving our developer relations team time to work with the developer to correct the issue.  We have been in contact with the developer since he followed back up with us. We hope to get the underlying issues resolved and get Breakup Notifier running again.<p>We want Facebook to be a great place for both people and developers — and we work very hard to ensure that we are balancing all the factors at play. We think our systems do a reasonable job helping us strike this balance, but we are open to feedback and constantly look to tune how we react to these situations.<p>Comments, flames, etc. welcomed.",1298526325

Fewer questions about what was already in my (occasionally quite large) medical history - they could find it.  Access to the relevant info like X-rays or blood tests, with more information than printouts carry, and adjustable contrast on digital X-rays.  And the full history of <i>every</i> similar test I've ever had.  My visits have been faster and far more useful <i>every single time</i>.<p>Bring on the tech!  I'm tired of having doctor visits where I have to re-state my history when they can read it in a second, and they're tired of lengthy reviewing of my data before the visit (if they do so at all).  The only complaint I've heard from the doctors / nurses (and I've asked every single one I've encountered with them) is that they hate using a pen and hate the interface (missing the maximize button and closing the application, for instance).<p>The nurses in particular loved that the doctors <i>typed</i>.  Universally, they've said they had fewer medication errors, fewer ""what is that?"" questions for the doctors, and they get a bit of history and can see abnormal changes and question them in case of a mis-type.  Which happens, but usually goes unnoticed if it's not on a computer.<p>YMMV, of course.  And theirs.<p>Billing and medical: why do they belong together?  I doubt the doctor is also the accountant in even the smallest clinic, and they have no need to see the information.

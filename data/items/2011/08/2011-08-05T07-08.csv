They have to work through the night, and gradually develop a variety of disorders. Since a similar time difference exists in the case of Kenya, some call center employees might start facing such health issues.<p>More jobs are great. But the long terms costs need to be considered.

I find myself taking lists for all sorts of things, and wishing I could digitize them somehow. <a href=""http://buddhalists.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buddhalists.com/</a> is the solution for me. I sampled every list app in the app store (a good $60 worth) and found that they were<p>1. mostly focused on todo lists<p>2. either too simple (think one page list) or too complex (think color coded tags with autosort built in)<p>3. Always limited to either managing one list, or several flat lists. I was hoping for recursion.<p>This is what <a href=""http://buddhalists.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buddhalists.com/</a> brings to the table. Simple unconstraining lists with nice design, no rules, and infinite recursion. For more explanation, see the demo.

They can program in half a dozen programing languages. But they couldn't tell you the basics.<p>They couldn't say what the difference between functional and object-oriented programing is. They couldn't tell you what a good name for a variable is (maybe they have somewhat good variable names, but they don't really know why they are good or bad). They couldn't properly define an architecture for a new project.<p>There are basics in programing that should be known before all the programing languages, frameworks and what not.

I actually consider myself a feminist.  I've been outspoken in the past on things like believing that the gender gap in computer science and IT is primarily a consequence of social conditioning and that people should be evaluated and valued within an organization based on their qualifications and not based on their gender.<p>As such, I'm a bit uneasy with the premise of the article -- that work environments can and should be made more ""girl friendly"" (insofar as that goes beyond not tolerating overt sexism).  But that premise came from the article, not from me.  Personally, I'm conflicted there and could argue both sides.  But, if we run with that premise, and try to answer the question in the title, I find it an impressive stretch to read sexism into saying, ""I find mixed gender work environments more pleasant than single-gender environments.""",1312530752

Would be glad to check it out and support yah! :)<p>> Geting UI right is really, really hard... But if I want a list dialog, or a grid view...<p>Indeed.. UI is hard though I'd say list dialogs and grid view is still GL possible without too much difficulty given various tool kits. Yes a WebKit view is difficult to pull off cross-platform presently. There are options like Awesomium though I've yet to see it used on a mobile platform, however I'm sure something will come up soon.<p>Yes.. a keyboard entry field depending w/ a GL UI in conjunction with say popping up the default native UI keyboard for touch only devices is something that would need to be fine tuned.<p>I plan to tackle general GL UI matters at a future point to offer a nicely integrated set of optional components. You are right though it's generally difficult.<p>For aspects in TyphonRT that require local / native peers the main application container is loaded declaratively with a cross-platform interface component backed by the proper native implementation, so from the devs perspective they can just request the common interface and the platform specific aspects are active behind the scene.<p>>... most platforms I write for don't already have a guaranteed JVM<p>Yes, for a desktop release it might be pertinent to distribute a private stripped down JVM. For mobile.. Well.. It's not easily feasible or likely allowed if I recall in the TOS to have a JVM on the iPhone. Cross-compilation is the likely way to go if / when TyphonRT supports iOS.<p>>How much overhead does Scala add to an app on Android?<p>Yeah you got me there.. ;) If one uses the Scala standard library that jar file is ~8MB. Whether that can be split up and paired down I'm not sure yet. I'm close to starting on Scala integration (mind you this is optional w/ TyphonRT).<p>There are also platform aspects of TyphonRT that will reduce overhead for multiple apps installed, but this gets into a bit more conversation here than necessary; essentially though side-loading shared components installed by other apps thus minimizing each app requiring a large download.<p>So yeah, some work and experimentation ahead. I'll definitely be working on a minimum profile (if possible) for Scala integration.",1312528528

2849247,comment,2848239,2848239,11,0,thristian,,,"It seems a bit cruel that he mentions ""horror stories"" about Twisted; most of the culture shock people complain about with Twisted is exactly the kind of flow-control shenanigans that he describes in Node.js. In fact, Twisted makes those particular examples easier.<p>To handle branching flow-control like 'if' statements, Twisted gives you the Deferred object[1], which is basically a data structure that represents what your call stack would look like in a synchronous environment. For example, his example would look something like this, with a hypothetical JS port:<p><pre><code>    d = asynchronousCache.get(""id:3244""); // returns a Deferred
    d.addCallback(function (result) {
	if (result == null) {
	    return asynchronousDB.query(""SELECT * from something WHERE id = 3244"");
	} else {
	    return result;
	}
    });
    d.addCallback(function (result) {
	// Do various stuff with myThing here
    });
</code></pre>
Not quite as elegant as the original synchronous version, but much tidier than banging raw callbacks together - and more <i>composable</i>. Deferred also has a .addErrback() method that corresponds to try/catch in synchronous code, so asynchronous error-handling is just as easy.<p>For the second issue raised, about asynchronous behaviour in loops, Twisted supplies the DeferredList - if you give it a list (an Array, in JS) of Deferreds, it will call your callback function when <i>all</i> of them have either produced a result or raised an exception - and give you the results in the same order as the original list you passed in.<p>It is a source of endless frustration to me that despite Twisted having an excellent abstraction for dealing with asynchronous control-flow (one that would be even better with JavaScript's ability to support multi-statement lambda functions), JavaScript frameworks generally continue to struggle along with raw callbacks. Even the frameworks that <i>do</i> support some kind of Deferred or Promise object generally miss some of the finer details. For example, jQuery's Deferred is inferior to Twisted's Deferred: <a href=""http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.twisted/22891"" rel=""nofollow"">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.twisted/22891</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer....</a>",1312527942

Especially when many word problems are not practical or even correct?<p>How about this for motivation, we solve such equations because we can.  Solving equations is useful and the more equations we can solve the better.<p>It's not really motivating when we give a word problem whose model is a radical equation and then say solve the equation.  Most equations can't be solved by algebraic methods and anyone who really needs to solve an equation and trust the answer is better off having a computer do the computation.<p>In solving the 30 problems one might get to a point in understanding why sqrt(2x+1) = sqrt(x) + 1 is slightly harder than solving sqrt(x+1) = sqrt(x) + 1.  In solving 30 problems one might get to a point to discover why sqrt equations can be solved but why we don't solve cube root equations.  Or why sqrt(2x+3) = x is fundamentally easier than sqrt(2x+3) = x + 1.  You won't get this from solving word problems.",1271627780

I've lost 15 kg since last summer, not feeling hungry at all, so it's not ""1000 calories less than required"", at least not what my apetite requires :) In fact, I don't feel like I'm doing a diet, it hasn't been my intention at all. I simply started eating a lot more fruit, in part by accident (didn't know how delicious is pinneaple), in part for convenience (apples are easy to bring in the backpack, salads come now in cheap bags), in part because of my son (he loves orange juice at all times, I eat the ones that remain).<p>Also it's better to avoid prepared food. I still eat a lot of pasta and meat (I've just enjoyed a 250 g steak) and enough seafood. The only significant casualties are bread (only with meat or fish) and cheese... like Hurley said ""everybody likes cheese"", but it does no good to me :-(<p>I agree that exercise is great. But I live far from sea, so I can't windsurf most of the year, and jogging bores me to death. Once year ago I went to the gym and it was really good, but it made me really hungry, so it didn't help with weight lose. In my twenties it was different, but at the time it was much more intense than what I can do now.",1271626991

As for average speed that is one of those concepts that really isn't that relatable and should probably require an introduction beforehand.<p>As for the goal of a math class being that students should come out understanding math I completely agree but the beauty of math is that it is applicable everywhere and the goal of teaching a math class should be that students understand mathematics and where to apply it.<p>I couldn't imagine being taught vector calculus without some mention of applications and examples, my professor catered more towards mathematics majors with an abundance of Tensor notation and proofs but he never failed to understand that many in his class learned well by physical and other practical examples such as magnetism or fluids and so on.<p>Although I failed to watch your video I believe there is most likely a counterargument to word problems and what effect they have on students because if students really are solving word problems with the math they are learning the issue isn't that they don't understand what is going on but rather how to apply it to an actual math problem.

One of the reasons that we're starting to hear obesity specialists back away from advocating the ""moderate-vigorous exercise"" as part of a weight-loss plan is because of the things this article brings up: in some people (mostly women), starting an exercise regime spikes appetite and makes it extremely difficult to stick to a calorie-controlled/restricted diet.  Thus, even if the RMR increases, it seems the body is insisting calorie intake increase as well -- and I think that's where the confusion they are portraying is mostly stemming from: is it responsible to advocate moderate-vigorous exercise to the obese as part of a weight-loss plan, or is that setting them up to fail?

There are compelling arguments for both points of view.<p>When you say problem solving do you really mean so called practical applications?  If so then I disagree.  If you mean solving problems to understand the essence of mathematical ideas then I agree.<p>For instance, linear equations are the easiest equations to solve.  All of them can be manipulated to yield the solution (or be reduced to showing all numbers are solutions or have no solutions).  Linear equations are really 1st degree polynomials.  What about second degree polynomials?  After a clever bit of insight and some work we get that all 2nd degree polynomials can be solved.  The quadratic equation is a solution to a problem in mathematics.  It's useful as it leads to a greater understanding of mathematics.<p>I believe that this is what mathematics courses ought to focus on.  Not on problems that involve throwing a ball in the air and predicting how long it takes to hit the ground.",1271625203

A valuable skill for any educated person is the ability to plod through minutia and make sense of it.  Being able to be focused on the point at hand and not let distractions cloud judgment is a valuable skill.<p>If one really understands the mechanics of logs then I think they will not freak out when presented with a formula involving logs.  I'm all in favor of applications but isn't this the job of other subjects?  The applications should be taught in the subjects that apply it.

This happens at Harvard and the community college.<p>I've given my students the standard word problems on travelling problems.  They get the problems right.  Then I ask them this simple problem and they universally get is wrong:<p>You drive 1 mile at 40 mph and then the next mile drive 60 mph.  What is your average speed?  (Almost everyone says 50 mph.)  We aren't teaching thinking skills.  We are teaching memorization of problem types.  Almost none of them is actually practical, correct, or useful.<p>But why are we teaching travelling problems in a math class?  I think it should be taught in physics.",1271624822

They're too careless and breezy on any number of vectors -- more like a better than usual newspaper feature article.  You know, something about the local Pumpkin Festival or whatever.",1225371102
348662,comment,348602,348602,0,0,jm4,,,"Ok, here's my little rant...<p>I don't get this whole using a verb as a noun thing. It's stupid and when people use the word ""fail"" like this in all caps it makes them look stupid. Reddit is filled with trashy headlines like this and it's ridiculous. I may be alone here, but I would prefer a slightly higher level of discourse than what's over there. I can understand common grammar mistakes, but I have a hard time understanding why a person would choose to write or speak in a way that makes him look like a fool.<p>My other gripe is that this user, ""thenextweb"", only submits stories from thenextweb.org. Again, I may be alone, but I think that if you can't rely on your readers to submit links to your blog and constantly have to plug it yourself then it's not worth reading. We are not here to generate your ad revenue whenever you want to submit one of your own stories. If it's truly worthwhile it will no doubt make it's way here on its own.",1225370764

Divide your time in half between both jobs, with a clear agreement with your partner that you will only spend half the time.<p>I just don't think that if you are a single person trying to work alone on an app that is aimed at the YC demographic that you will produce anything spectacular. When you work with other people, you'll tend to have more diverse opinions. And you will learn to juggle your responsibilites in a way that will train you for running a real business.<p>If you are just sitting at home alone working on your idea for one year, it's an entire year out of the 60 you got gone.",1225370106

If the company has filed suit and went to court they have already spent $25,000 or more just to file the paperwork. He should ask for the world and slowly go down from there.<p>In a prior job the company I was with renamed itself. The branding consultants and executive management found the perfect name and started moving forward with all the changes. Then they asked my VP about the websites and such. Of course the name was already registered. After approaching the domain owner about the name he requested $50,000. After haggling the domain owner happily took $20,000. My VP was actually authorized to spend $5 million to acquire that domain.<p>Point of the story, obviously want that domain badly so your initial amount should be painfully large. Just keep reminding your friend how (s)he felt the day all the legal paperwork was handed to him.",1225369917

The latter is more of a high-end curiousity for those well-off enough to indulge in it, it's an incremental increase in both performance and price over previous electric cars.  I'd love to trade in my BMW for a Tesla, but it's a 12 year old M3, and to get similar performance from an electric car I'd have to pay ~8 times as much money.  That's not disruptive or revolutionary.",1225369572

The buyer will usually pay 50% on completion (signing) of the contracts and 50% on successful transfer of the domain name(s). Make sure to start the domain transfer process the moment the contract is signed.""<p>This is not quite the normal way that it works. In the last 12 months I have been involved in two major UK web acquisitions and, actually, the way it works is that a couple of % of the transaction value is kept as a retention for a full financial year after completion. This is in case of something going wrong (whatever that might be), the buyers will have a pool of cash big enough to sort out whatever is likely to happen. If everything checks out ok, then that cash will be released.",1225368987

Different cultures and groups treat ""likes"" differently, so you shouldn't be surprised if some groups are a bit gun-ho when it comes to liking pages. Generally I've found that if you're using targeting the US or UK using keyword targets that it isn't generally a problem.",1353758330

There's no little irony in the fact that as China has moved more Capitalist<p>I think you need to read more Marx.  Capitalism is the way you generate the capital to fund Socialism.  Marx was aware that even if your own country was Communist, others wouldn't be, so their would be a ""Opening up"" phase where you move your country through Capitalism, until internal capital is enough to keep your entire population 'comfortable'.",1353758326

4825133,comment,4821928,4821928,6,0,geuis,,,"I live in the Apple ecosystem for one simple reason. Out of every other collection of technology items I could use for both work and entertainment, Apple products are the least frustrating ones to use.<p>I value my time above everything else.<p>I used Windows for years. Built, repaired, and maintained Windows systems for work. Setup and ran email servers. Even did some initial web development on IIS servers.<p>I am 32 and visibly grayer than I probably should be. If you know me in person, you can see it in my beard and in my hair when I let it get longer.<p>Getting nearly anything done with Windows has always been an exercise in frustration for me. Tools, user interfaces, etc. Even their best products always had something wrong, something just wasn't built right. One more little speed bump to slow down what I want to do.<p>Eventually I switched to Macs about 6 years ago. I had used them as a kid and it was easy, from that exposure, to switch back. Anything that needed terminal tools to get done, just works. Lots and lots of open source projects that run on Linux almost always just work on Mac OS. For the ones that don't work off to bat, its usually easy to fix.<p>In terms of phones, I've stuck with iPhones since they came out. For the first couple years, it was because there were no comparable products on the market in term of fit and finish. Android was a swamp of sorrows for the longest time. Any hardware companies made and slapped Android onto were just sorrows layered onto junk devices that were a miserable experience to use.<p>I had the joy of working with various Android handsets and tablets a few years ago for testing. It was good exposure that reinforced the simple ""it works"" of the iPhone.<p>When the iPad came out, I was excited by it like millions of other people. Oddly, while I still have my first-gen iPad and while I love it as a device, it turns out its never been a form factor that I have really been able to incorporate into my life. It wasn't that the iPad is a bad device, but rather that it hasn't been a tool that I really needed. But its a great tool that millions of other people have found to be very useful indeed. Any other Android tablets just couldn't compare in usability or hardware fit, which is why the earlier ones fell so flat.<p>More recently, I found the Windows Phone OS to be intriguing. A good friend that works at MS showed me the first ones that came out. I rather liked the fresh new take on a phone OS. Loved the interface. I seriously considered switching over to one for a while. But then as I used it, the rough bits showed through. Subpar hardware. Bad battery life. Random crashes. Oddly incomplete UI choices that made some simple tasks frustrating to complete. So, I kept my iPhone 4 for a long time.<p>Very recently, Windows 8. Metro UI. Looks great on a tablet, same nice looking interface. A couple years had gone by and more than enough time had passed for Microsoft to work out some of the early kinks. I excitedly bought a new copy the day it came out and installed it on a spare machine at the office. The installation went really smoothly.<p>But when I started using it, it was literally only a couple of minutes before the ""wtf"" moments started. The biggest issues I saw immediately was that too much of the UI is hidden away. I got very frustrated trying to do things like switching between apps, using IE 10, getting away from the completely anachronistic Desktop app. I tried installing some apps and some went to Metro, others went to Desktop with no clear indication why. When I needed to make some adjustments to system settings, it took me over 5 minutes to figure out how to even get to the settings.<p>I'm also still really pissed with my nice long complex password being chopped to 16 characters on Windows, Live, etc. Its fucking annoying.<p>Anyway, while I like the direction that MS is going, they still haven't gotten their stuff together. Its not the same as it used to be, but the frustration level is still there.<p>I've had an Xbox for years too. In its simplest form, I put a game disk in and it loads up, and I play the game. But in the last few years, they've added all of this extra stuff. New UI, music services, movie services, constant updates, Kinect, etc. And while it all looks shiny, none of it really works together that well. So, I almost never use my Xbox anymore because its just gotten too complicated to do what I want, which is to simply play games. Ugh.<p>The non-Apple tech I use and love: Gmail, Ubuntu for servers, Dropbox, github, Audible, Rdio, Netflix, torrents, Google Maps (PLEASE release an iOS app for this!), and others.<p>Notice that at no point in this ramble do I mention Music or Movies as keeping me with Apple. It literally has nothing to do with an ""ecosystem"". It just has to do with building superior products that have the least frustration to getting shit done. That's the sole thing you need to worry about when building a product that people will love.<p>Be less frustrating than your competitors, and you have a good edge.<p>Lots of companies make individual products that are well polished. Only a few make lots of products of high quality.",1353758005

Splats, loops, string interpolation and comprehensions are like added bonus (they are technically syntactic sugar, but make thing <i>so</i> much easier, cleaner and more readable that it's worth using CS for these features alone). True, CS makes debugging a bit harder (though SourceMaps might make that a thing of the past), but as CS code is much cleaner and easier to read, stupid typos are less likely to happen and most of the time, bugs are logical not because you accidentally didn't put a semicolon there, or used ; instead of ,",1353757443

Depending on materials used (concrete for\ninstance - that prefers to be loaded in compression), the vacuum can\nactually IMPROVE stability and safety.  As far as a pressurized ""loop""\nas you describe, it would greatly INCREASE DRAG compared to a vehicle\nin the open air.  What you describe is a 'Pneumatic Tube Transport'\n(PTT) system (as used in bank drive-up windows).  PTT does not scale\nup well due to the enormous drag of air on the ENTIRE inside surface\nof the tube.  Large PTT systems take a lot of power regardless of use.\n The energy per vehicle would be greater (but could be reduced a\nlittle by using hydrogen or helium that has less drag than air (mostly\nnitrogen)); however small molecules leak much more than large ones,\nand the expensive working fluid would have to be replaced.<p>Google ""Evacuated Tube Transport"" (ETT) or ""Evacuated Tube Transport\nTechnologies"" (ET3) (trade marks of ET3 Global Alliance, and et3.com\nInc.) on google and youtube -- watch the videos to learn of more\nadvantages.

Whilst I've not worked for Google, quite unsurprisingly I've interviewed my fair share of folk who were at Google, and we've hired many of them.<p>Quick sidebar: hiring is super important for us at Facebook. We want to keep working with the smartest people on the planet, who also fit in culturally, and so interviewing is one of the things we take really seriously.<p>The one thing that we are also very serious about at Facebook is that once you get the job, we want you to be doing that which you are most passionate about, because we know that when you are doing something that you are passionate about, you will produce your best work, and be happy doing it. We don't just slot people into where we think they fit, or where we have a gap, simply because the skills on their resum fit. A lot of time and effort goes into introducing new hires to as broad a swathe of engineering teams and activities as possible to allow them to make an informed decision about which team they want to join.<p>We also don't tie engineers to any one team for the duration of their tenure at Facebook, and actively encourage them to not get in a rut, regularly move teams and challenge themselves with something they're unfamiliar with.  Personal success and career satisfaction is very much up to the individual in many respects. And this applies equally to individual contributors and managers.<p>What I love most about working at Facebook though is still being able to have a tangible impact. I have seen it grow from < 100M users to > 1B users, and seen the infrastructure and engineering teams grow with it, and all without negatively impacting the scope to actually do stuff. And I don't just mean small iterations on a big bit of software. We constantly evaluate our tools and systems, and are not scared to discard what no longer works, and regularly build new and highly impactful stuff from the ground up. Oh, and there is seldom any precedent to go by either!<p>It is a fantastic place to work, with lots of great people, who are all insanely smart and very motivated.",1353757048

Would it mean you could walk down the supermarket aisle and buy a substance for 9,99$ that ruins your life within seconds? The danger seems to me to signal ""drugs are safe"" by legalizing them - usually the government is supposed to ban dangerous foods, I think?<p>Sure, you can already buy cigarettes and alcohol, but I don't think they make you addicted after just one shot.<p>Just asking - perhaps there are plans for distributing them in a different way?<p>Also, even if they were legalized, would it mean those drug cartels would go away? They are now an organization embedded in society, why should they loosen their grip? Like if an independent drugstore opens to sell legal heroin, what would stop them from setting it on fire and shooting the owners?",1353755117

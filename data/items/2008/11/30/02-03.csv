No matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check would at least remind everyone there had to be a cost, and send them looking for it.</i><p>To me that's the most important paragraph here. That takes you from ""let's make sure this never happens again"" to a cost-benefit analysis. The issue is not whether or not to have checks, as much of the discussion here assumes. It's about realizing that not all checks are equivalent, and using that knowledge to get the greatest safety at the lowest cost.",1228013920
380584,comment,379379,380202,0,0,dejb,,,"I think it is an unfortunate situation where insulting a stupid proposition is seen as worse than proposing it in the first place.<p>My belief is that thinking people should take a tougher line on ignorance, irrationality and stupidity. By choosing to engage with these type of opinions with a 'neutral stance' you are giving strength and legitimacy to their arguments. You are essentially saying 'Although your argument seems reasonable, I disagree for the following reasons'.<p>So maybe I went too far. But I do think there should be a cost for making spurious arguments. Also I feel the casual viewer of arguments shyould be left in no doubt as to the validity of the original statement.",1228013900

Seriously, get the emotional support of your friends and family.  Initially, you needed their support, because dropping out of college and starting a company definitely is a ballsy and ""stupid"" move in the eyes of many parents.  However,  you need their support now more than ever, because you risk slipping into a massive depression.<p>If you can, live off your parents.  Cut as many expenses as possible.  Get a few jobs.  I would say pay off your debt AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  It will be the most emotionally taxing and anxiety-inducing factors in your life for a while. This could also manifest into severe depression which has all sorts of massively negative side effects which could delay paying off your debt due to mental exhaustion. A year of solid hard work would pay off most of your credit card debt.",1228013425

I'm hoping other HN readers have been faced with this choice, or similar, and could tell me what decision they made and how it worked out for them.  \n  I don't have anything against working for a big company, but it was made pretty clear to me that at IBM I would be working on enterprise applications using java, among other technologies, on windows.

This is because the cutoff for deciding which league to play in is January 1st.  Kids born in the first half of the year are older and bigger than the other kids. They make it onto the best teams in the best leagues and get more practices.  Ultimately this advantage allows them to play professionally at a higher rate.",1228012238

I too was in a similar situation a number of years ago when my (as in I owned it) company was taken out by the post 911 meltdown. I closed out with more debt than you.<p>My suggestions (as someone who is not an attorney or a CPA) are:<p>1. Talk with the hosting company to get out of the contract.\n2. Call all of your creditors, and tell them your situation. Ask them to help you and see if you can work out a payment plan. My creditors were surprisingly willing to help.\n3. Get a full time job, work hard, and pay off your debt.\n4. Keep your products on simmer until the time is again right. If you built a company once, you can do it again.<p>Being in debt sucks, and it took a number of years for me to get out of it; however, declaring bankruptcy will ruin your credit and be on your record for years to come. If you have that on your credit record, then creditors will stay away from you for years to come.<p>The economy is taking out companies left and right. Small and large alike.

380559,comment,380377,380473,0,0,timr,,,"Boy...I was ready to vote up this comment, but then I hit the part about not worrying about the $30k in credit-card debt.  Instant down arrow.  Absolutely TERRIBLE advice.<p>Whatever you do, you really must <i>pay down the debt</i>.  Minimum payments aren't going to cut it -- this is <i>revolving</i> debt that you're talking about, and if you don't make more than the minimum payments, it's only going to get worse.  People routinely go bankrupt by ignoring their credit cards.<p>Moreover, so long as you're paying tens of percent interest on your debt (as with most credit-card interest rates), every other investment that you make has to return <i>more than your interest payments</i> for the investment to be worthwhile.  If you view a business as an investment -- just like a stock or bond -- then it makes no sense to start one while indebted unless you're sure that the return will exceed he cost of the debt.  Otherwise, you're just taking careless risks with your finances, in the name of a more adventurous lifestyle.<p>Living frugally, you can easily pay down $30k in a few years at any decent job.  Negotiate with your lenders, get the interest rate as low as you can, liquidate the corporate assets, and <i>get rid of the debt</i>.  Starting a company is hard enough -- don't saddle yourself with the additional burden of serious personal debt before you begin.",1228011140

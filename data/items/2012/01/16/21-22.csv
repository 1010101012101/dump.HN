Furthermore, much of the Anglophone world uses US internet services and products that would likely be affected by SOPA (facebook, youtube, reddit, en.wikipedia, 4chan, etc.).

US law doesn't govern me!!"" <- yes but US <i>does</i> govern Google, which operates out of the US).<p>This fact is a good argument for creating competing services <i>not</i> based in the US (even tho it'd probably be illegal for us 'murkins to use them :/ ).",1326750947

In 1981 a small group of us coerced the Unix verion 7 portable C compiler to generate VLIW assembler as a senior project.  There was nothing astonishing going on; the pcc had perhaps a couple dozen things it needed to be able to generate (conditional execution, arithmetic, pointers), and it was a simple matter of not using stuff before the (very primitive and shallow) pipeline was able to deliver it.

3472582,comment,3471970,3472546,21,0,palish,,,"Translation for readers:<p>Let's say you have some floating point numbers, like...<p><pre><code>  float A = 42.90F;\n  float B = 00.01F;\n  float C = /* ... */;\n  float D = /* ... */;\n</code></pre>\n(A + B + C) will not necessarily produce the same result as (A + C + B).<p>In fact, if you do (A + B + B + B ...) very much, then you will wind up exacerbating the problem --- it can be a source of bugs if you repeatedly increment a counter by small floating point values.  For example:<p><pre><code>  const int Iterations = 10;\n  for ( int i = 0; i < Iterations; ++i )\n    A += B;\n  printf( ""%2.4f\n"", A );\n</code></pre>\nThe output is 43.0000, as you'd expect.  But what if we increase Iterations to 100?  We get 43.8998.<p>Astute readers probably would note that 00.01F can't be exactly represented in base 2, and wonder whether something like 00.0125F would still suffer from this problem.  Alas, yes:<p><pre><code>  A = 42.9000F \n  B = 00.0125F\n\n  8    iterations ==  43.0000 \n  80   iterations ==  43.9001\n  800  iterations ==  52.9006\n  8000 iterations == 142.8820  /* we would expect 142.9 */\n</code></pre>\nSo if you want to parallelize some computations, and you want to do 4000 iterations on core #1 and 4000 iterations on core #2 and then sum the results, well... let's see what happens:<p><pre><code>  float A1 = 42.9000F;\n  float B1 = 00.0125F;\n\n  float A2 = 42.9000F;\n  float B2 = 00.0125F;\n\n  const int Iterations = 4000;\n  for ( int i = 0; i < Iterations; ++i )\n  {\n    A1 += B1;\n    A2 += B2;\n  }\n  float A = A1 + A2 - 42.9000F;\n  printf( ""%2.4f\n"", A );\n</code></pre>\nThe output is 142.8885 -- which is different from our earlier result of 142.8820!<p>You may be tempted to try various things to get around this fact... for example, what about counting from zero rather than from 42.9000?  (Answer: the error can be even worse, which is a topic worthy of its own separate post) ... but you will quickly discover that this is a fundamental issue.  The order of operations matters.",1326750701

Because it has to be for data (or code simply wouldn't work), and I don't see why function symbols would be any different.<p>Also C and C++ say that a function has the same address in all translation units, so comparing the address ought to match regardless of PIC or shared libraries or symbol overriding, and if they don't it's probably a bug in the compiler/linker (or you're using a nonstandard option that breaks this guarantee, e.g. symbol hiding.) And actually this should require that the address in the GOT is the final address of the function.<p>By the way, any CPU that has static destination branch prediction will predict as well for a double indirect call as a single indirect call (assuming of course the addresses don't change.) The cost is taking up two entries in the branch prediction tables, another L1I cacheline for the stub, and a hiccup in instruction decoding which may or may not have a real effect depending on the code before and after.<p>> If theres a reason for getting the address indirectly like this, I have yet to find it.<p>It should be because of PIC, and the fact that PC-relative addressing on x86_64 has only 2GB displacement, so if your final binary is over 2GB the linker could fail to put the symbol within range of the offset and fail. Whereas for calls the linker can just insert a stub if this happens and noone's the wiser. Disabling PIC results in ""movq $externalFunction, externalVariable(%rip)"" for me.<p>But -mcmodel=small is the default, which should contradict this explanation...<p>EDIT: so I just tried a test and it appears the GOT on Linux really does contain the address of the stub. <i>what the fuck</i><p>On OS X it contains the real address.",1326749468

But memory has the same economies as 'cores' in that it's more cost effective when it is in fewer chips. But the chip is limited in how fast it can send signals over its pins to neighboring chips (see Intel's work on Light bridge).<p>So you end up with what are currently exotic chip on chip types of deals, or little Stonehenge like motherboards where this smoking hot chip is surrounded by a field of RAM shooting lasers at it.<p>The problem with <i>that</i> vision is that to date, the 'gains' we've been seeing have been when the chips got better but the assembly and manufacturing processes stayed more or less the same.<p>So when processors got better the existing manufacturing processes were just re-used.<p>That doesn't mean that at some point in the future we might have 1000 core machines, it just means that other stuff will change first (like packaging) before we get them. And if you are familiar with the previous 'everything will be VLIW (very large instruction world)' prediction you will recognize that a lack of those changes sometimes derail the progress. (in the VLIW case there have been huge compiler issues)<p>The interconnect issue is that 1000 cores can not only consume terabytes of memory bandwidth they can generate 10s of gigabytes of data to and from the compute center. That data, if it is being ferried to the network on non-volatile storage needs channels that run at those rates. Given that the number of 10GbE ports on 'common computers' is still quite small, another barrier to this vision coming to pass is that these machines will be starved for bandwidth to get to fresh data to work on, or to put out data they have digested or transformed.",1326749150

You may be partly right about why we're defending them but what's foremost in my mind when I defend them is how innocent what they did was. All they did was look at a file name of their 100 millionth upload. They were proud, wanted to brag about, and I really empathize as they meant no harm. I trust that they only did this a single time only to mark the special occasion and mentioning the name (or assuming the contents of, in this case) the file only happened because it lent itself well to the joke they referenced, otherwise I have no doubt they would have just said they hit 100 million uploads and left it at that.<p>When I talk about odds we're on the same page in a way. We absolutely should expect them to minimize the risk but let's not fool ourselves into believing that no one will ever take the opportunity to access one of our files. The best we can do is mitigate the risks and hope for the best. I don't feel that their pulling up the file name in this situation is a meaningful breach of trust.

And let's assume it's 10x. So these are ALL very conservative numbers for early stage investors. Let's say she ends up with 50% net profit (never gonna happen). And let's say she pays out 100% of profits as dividends (never gonna happen).

Some synchronization is algorithmically necessary for pretty much any useful application. The key is to find methods in which synchronization is distributed, with short critical paths (usually logarithmic in the problem size, with good constants).",1326747841

It's interesting precisely because it seems to illustrate that there's not a stark binary choice between 'democracy' and 'despotism', but rather a more multidimensional choice space, and on many scales their choices are doing very well.<p>It's also the case that even in impeccable liberal democracies, cities/regions/jurisdictions larger than Singapore's 4-million population can remain overwhelmingly loyal to a single party for decades, for its local officials and representatives to national legislature.<p>For example, Chicago has had Democratic Party mayors for almost twice as long as Singapore has existed as a country. Some unfair play by the incumbent machine is an understood factor, but it's also the case that the major alternative statewide, the Republican Party, isn't very attractive to city residents. What competition does occur happens under one party label.<p>Against its region, then, the noncompetitiveness of Singapore internal politics may be just as much or more an outgrowth of that same sort of local identity/satisfaction against distinct alternatives, as it is from the unfair play.",1326747754

There may be some truth to that - MySpace is about 4 times bigger by the numbers, and in most other industries, 80% market share = winner.  It's hard for us to see that because we're from the demographic that tends to use FaceBook, but remember that 2/3 of Americans don't even <i>go</i> to college, let alone use a social networking site centered around the college experience.<p>I can kinda see FaceBook vs. MySpace as being today's Apple vs. Microsoft (or IBM) battle.  FaceBook's cultivated a sort of elite brand - ""we're better than Myspacers simply because we're on FaceBook"".  But remember that Microsoft eventually won: the masses, by definition, are far more numerous than the elite.",1209830180

I doubt that this sort of thing will just fall out from bayesian networks, or from any simple development based on bayesian networks.<p>The most effective existing approaches to natural language understanding are purely statistics based. This works fairly well (about 85% error rate) in narrow domains. Most approaches aren't even bayesian network based, but use Markov chains/models which can be called a precursor to bayesian networks.",1209829574

The author is coming from the perspective of a large corporation type and fails to see that not selling out and not compromising your ideals will win in the long term.

180276,comment,180176,180188,0,0,dhs,,,">Do you think AI progress is going to continue accelerating for a while?<p>From where I stand, it looks like the more recent progress in AI is due to a shift in research hypotheses. It used to be like ""AI  is the attempted simulation, or sometimes attempted emulation, of human cognition""; now it's more like ""AI is a medium for various forms of human expression"". Ms. Koller's work emphasizes numerical expression; the work in Game AI emphasizes visual-artistic and/or logical expression, the work in Natural Language Processing emphasizes expression in natural language. Few people try for machines which pass the Turing Test; many try for machines which capture a small slice of real-life semantics and run with it. As Alan Perlis once wrote: ""When we write programs that 'learn', it turns out we do and they don't.""<p>I believe that we increasingly realize what he meant with this. And that's good, because not only does it say something about what we cannot do, but it also says what we can. People are increasingly aware of this, go pragmatic (Google/MapReduce proved that you can go quite a ways using brute force), and make progress.",1209828752

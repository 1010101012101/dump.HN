Encryption/hashing are your last line of defense.  They're what you hope hold strong when they've blasted through everything else.

3415418,comment,3415327,3415327,0,0,FaceKicker,,,"Disclosure: first-year CS Ph.D. student.<p>I would say, no, a scientist doesn't really need a ""Ph.D."", but does need the training that a Ph.D. involves.  To me, this question is very different from the question of whether someone who wants to be an industry software engineer needs a bachelor's degree (a popular HN topic).  The difference is that in a science Ph.D. program, you are <i>doing science</i> the entire time you are there.  Sure, you take a few classes as well, but these are only to reinforce concepts you'll need in your research; the entire reason you're there is to learn to do scientific research by actually doing scientific research.  You are doing at school what you'll be doing in your career; you're just getting paid less for it because you're ""in training"".<p>I don't see any reason why one couldn't get a similar education by doing scientific research in an industry which does not result in a formal ""Ph.D."" degree, rather than an academic setting that does result in a Ph.D., it just doesn't seem like it's been tried up until (apparently) now.  Personally (all other things being equal) I'd rather do a Ph.D. program in an academic setting because an industry setting would likely be constrained to research areas that are beneficial to the company.",1325499461

Especially in biomed research, PhD students often seem to do extremely specialized research. Therefore, what they learn during their PhD may be much less generalizable than e.g. what CS PhD students learn. 
I guess it depends on the definition of a PhD whether it is necessary for a certain job or not.<p>Interesting comments here: <a href=""http://scientopia.org/blogs/science-professor/2011/03/22/rat-race/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scientopia.org/blogs/science-professor/2011/03/22/rat...</a>",1325499306
3415412,comment,3415327,3415327,0,0,kevinalexbrown,,,"I'm planning to get a PhD in a science, so this is a question I've asked myself a lot.<p>From a theoretical standpoint, a PhD is obviously not a magical ""get good at science"" button: there are plenty of other ways to gain competence. An example is Rick Stevens at Argonne National Labs, [1], who I'm pretty sure doesn't have a PhD (my friend worked for him once, and his bio doesn't mention it, but I don't know him personally). People like that show that a PhD is obviously not necessary to do first-class work.<p>On the other hand, if you want to be a principal investigator on a grant of any decent size, almost no one will believe you have that competence without a PhD. Part of this is the ridiculously rigid US scientific job market: all the arbitrary structure of a resume, even less of the rationale. You can't get a postdoc, almost trivially, without a doctorate. Even if someone wanted to give you a job as a postdoc, the university wouldn't like it, and why choose the guy without the PhD when you have other talented people who also have those three letters? And it's really hard to get a faculty position without a postdoc, so there you go.<p>So if I could go about becoming a principal investigator or having a nice faculty position without getting a PhD, I'd seriously consider it. But practically speaking, that's not a real possibility yet. Hopefully someday it will be.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.anl.gov/Administration/Bios/stevens.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anl.gov/Administration/Bios/stevens.html</a>",1325499292

No, apparently not.<p>The purpose of science related PhDs has always seemed to be a means to an end that wasn't financially available anywhere else. Academically, there are a lot of pursuits that you simply can not pursue outside of that setting. The science PhD is ultimately the direction you want your career to take, but you know it can't realistically take that path without some luck. And of course, the safety of academia is intoxicating on all levels. Why dive head first into research that requires funding and years of preparation when you can basically do the same thing at school without any repercussions? The PhD is a safety net for abstract thought that has little to do with the real world.<p>It may seem like a crazy comparison, but the sort of struggles scientists go through with their research is not entirely unlike what an artists goes through. No one really wants to acknowledge your absurd existence, and there's not really anyone to talk to when you do get on the outside. So no, success, be it financially or scientifically does not require higher education. But socially and emotionally, you can't underestimate the importance of things like a PhD.",1325498465

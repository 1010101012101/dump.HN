Logs are usually written to text files, which can be edited. The people interpreting the data could be making mistakes with the analysis before it even gets to Musk (look at all the posts about the problems with Excel on HN in the past couple of days).<p>Tesla's a startup. Startups can be a little chaotic. Their procedures and controls with respect to their data may not be as robust as, say a credit card company's, yet there's this big presumption that the data is all good and pure.<p>I would give Tesla the benefit of the doubt, since it would be very stupid to doctor up the data, but let's not all kid ourselves and not assume that Tesla's not going to shade their ""analysis"" in a way that is favorable to their argument.

It's true in proposal/grant writing, legal argumentation, or even just arguing with your parents. You should always lead with your strongest arguments, and think very carefully before including any weak ones. Humans are just bad at doing weighted analysis of persuasive arguments. Say you have an argument, with three points, with weights: 0.9, 0.05, and 0.05.

Most of them currently use a winner takes all system for their electors. Some states break them up according to vote totals. In the past the state legislatures often chose the electors. But over time this has changed to popular vote methods, as you say, which is interesting since that eventually lead us to a discussion about abolishing the Electoral College in favor of a national popular vote.<p>Not is there only no Federal requirement for people to vote for President, there's nothing in the Constitution about the right to vote in the first place. It's more like a privilege that can possibly be taken away. There is a list of reasons in the Constitution that cannot be used to prevent you from voting, many of them added in later via the amendment process. Most of the language of the Constitution doesn't actually give rights to the people, but restricts the actions of the government. The ""right"" to vote is considered a human right to determine your own leadership, but technically the states can prevent you from voting for any number of reasons. One common example is you lose your ability to vote if you commit a felony. I bet in some states it's even being convicted of a lesser charge is the threshold.<p>If you do have a ""right"" to vote, according to government, then it most likely will come from your state's Constitution.",1360878963

New Hampshire has been, in recent years, the one closely divided battleground state among the 13 smallest states (having supported the Democrat in 1992 and 1996, the Republican in 2000, and the Democrat in 2004 and 2008).</i><p><a href=""http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/resources/Withdrawal-V6-2010-3-13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/resources/Withdrawal-V6-2...</a><p><pre><code>  An attempt to change the “rules of the game” contrary to clause 2 of Article IV  \n    ● would violate the Impairments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and be void; \n    ● would violate existing federal law specifying that presidential electors may only \n      be appointed on one specific day in  every four-year period, namely the Tuesday \n      after the first Monday in November (i.e., election day);  \n    ● would invalidate the “conclusiveness”  of that state’s results under  existing \n      federal law specifying that presidential electors must be appointed under \n      “laws enacted prior” to the Tuesday after the first Monday in November;\n    [et al]</code></pre>",1360878519

Both can be used for rendering UI, but every technology has its strengths and weaknesses so the answer is ""it depends"".<p>You can either start by choosing a technology, then a project that is adapted to it. Or pick a project, and choose the framework that is best for achieving said project. Here are some thoughts about Node vs. Rails to help with your decision:<p>Node:\n- Uses Javascript (on back-end)\n- Asynchronous IO, great for handling high volume of requests or massive amount of simultaneous connections.\n- Smaller learning curve, given you're most likely already familiar with JS\n- Can do much more than traditional web frameworks (e.g. php/rails), like binding to a specific port, handling socket connections etc..\n- It's pretty fun :)<p>Rails:\n- Uses Ruby, so there's a bit of a learning curve here\n- Extremely mature framework with impressive amount of existing libraries (known as gems) that plugs into it\n- By nature, enforces great software practices (e.g. testing)\n- Best adapted for creating traditional SaaS applications\n- It's also a lot of fun :P<p>Honestly, if it's for fun, just pick one and start doing a project.

Which are mostly primitivist (as in, destroy infrastructure) communist (in the central planning, grey way depicted in i.e. The Dispossessed) or just kinda goofy. As a lifestyle choice, living off the refuse of a bloated and exorbitant society is actually quite sustainable until you need serious healthcare. As something for everybody to do, a new way of governing, it fails because there will be no society from which to absorb the waste. I think efforts to establish autonomous, non-hierarchal, consensus-based organizations or communities within capitalism is awesome. But ultimately, seven billion people are never going to form some totally sweet Zapatista-style worldwide commune. At that scale, the markets are going to be at work. Capitalism is inevitable.<p>My perspective is that appropriate solutions to this problem involve taxing externalities (pollution, murderous working conditions that cost society), and reducing the cronyism and corruption that breaks capitalism. Also deciding as a society that we are better off if people are not involuntarily homeless or hungry or dying and agreeing on a social contract to provide welfare.<p>I want to make the world a better place, so I choose to work on making more, better, cheaper, smarter education available to everyone everywhere.

She's child-like and the only one who seems emotionally involved in the relationship… but in almost exclusively passive way.

She kisses his picture during the ""shaving"" scene. She watches him walk down the street and talk at her on video… the only personal expression element of the ""story"" is his. She simply receives it. When she's upset, the focus is on what he does to her — the arm, the drawing, she receives the apology but never participates in a make-up.<p>It looks like the boyfriend is a prop. But the joke is it's that the woman, the focus of everything, is the prop, because it's from the boyfriend's PoV and she's just this super-emo recipient of his actions.

But the owners let me wait there while the Model S drank its juice. Tesla’s experts said that pumping in a little energy would help restore the power lost overnight as a result of the cold weather, and after an hour they cleared me to resume the trip to Milford.</i><p><i>Looking back, I should have bought a membership to Butch’s and spent a few hours there while the car charged. The displayed range never reached the number of miles remaining to Milford, and as I limped along at about 45 miles per hour I saw increasingly dire dashboard warnings to recharge immediately. Mr. Merendino, the product planner, found an E.V. charging station about five miles away.</i><p>So if you read just Musk's piece, you get the perception that Broder lied about not knowing that he was under-juiced. To paraphrase:<p>Broder: ""I should've stayed at the diner and charged for more hours""<p>Musk: ""Broder is an idiot who should've stayed at the diner and charged for more hours""<p>OK, no argument there. But if Broder is trying to show what a lemon the Tesla is, he's sure doing about it at a roundabout way (which I guess I what we'd <i>expect</i> a well-heeled Big Oil secret agent to do).<p>So Broder is a professional journalist at the Times, but as far as I can tell, his role is to not describe what it's feels like to be a tech-expert who owns a Tesla. His scenario is not at all alien to anyone who's driven a gas-powered car and skipped ""just one more"" off-ramp even as the fuel meter hovers at 0.<p>Irresponsible? Sure. But this is how an average car owner might act. Not every car owner has, on a given day, the ability to wait around an extra hour after breakfast at a diner for the car to keep charging. If the charging stations are as commonplace as the map Musk produced indicates, then Broder may have thought (and misjudged) that he could make it to the next public station.<p>I think a passage from earlier in Broder's review is a good insight to what he was thinking:<p>> <i>I drove a state-of-the-art electric vehicle past a lot of gas stations. I wasn’t smiling.<p>Instead, I spent nearly an hour at the Milford service plaza as the Tesla sucked electrons from the hitching post. When I continued my drive, the display read 185 miles, well beyond the distance I intended to cover before returning to the station the next morning for a recharge and returning to Manhattan.</i><p>The success of Tesla depends on the electric infrastructure improving dramatically. Until that comes about, there is apparently a lot of babying and thinking ahead that a Tesla owner has to do <i>even when the car is running just fine</i>.<p>I find it funny that so many people here are so quick to jump on Broder for not being so patient and tech savvy. While not everyone here is a huge Apple fan, I think most would laugh at a hardware manufacturer who delivered a high powered laptop that performed with variable results depending on the conditions of the day: it's powerful, and cutting edge, you'd just have to remember to plug it at night remember that the battery's decline won't be at a constant rate for more than the usual range of reasons.<p>It's not Tesla's fault that charging stations aren't ubiquitous, and Tesla deserves a lot of credit for trying to change it. And it's not Tesla's fault that people are sometimes dumb, impatient, and not constantly vigilant. But that's the reality of the market Tesla is selling its $100,000 vehicle for, and this is the market that the media writes for.",1360877737

It also had an annoying tendency to slot people who had been ""Principal Engineer"" or ""Distinguished Engineer"" at a previous company into ""Junior Engineer"" at Google, which really pissed them off (and sometimes lead to ""management action"" in the form of a formalized ""performance improvement plan"").<p>Basically the more senior you were, the more likely you were to wash out. Since Jeff was a ""Principle Engineer"" at eBay prior to Google I'm <i>guessing</i> that this was his path as well. Probably got slotted as 'senior engineer' (which is three levels below Google's equivalent of Principal Engineer) and said ""Screw this, I've paid my dues already, see ya!""

This is all very aggressive on Musk's part when the overall review still holds up (Tesla cars are bit ahead of the curve for normals).  If the log showed gross exaggeration I could see this reaction, but Musk is being a brat and wasting a lot of goodwill.  Remember, car reviewers are car reviewers, not QA engineers.  Things will go wrong, numbers won't match up exactly.  If you want positive coverage, don't post your MPG (or the electric equivalent) with ""best case"" numbers like a normal gas car.

5222429,comment,5220812,5221240,2,0,Thun,,,"Disclosure: I am an investor.<p>When we were doing diligence on Virool we ran our own tests with the platform. We took one of our portfolio company's videos and Spent $300 promoting it. At the beginning the video had 15 views and 0 likes. We were able to finish the campaign in a day, and at the end there were 7322 impressions and 3000 views. Note that Virool only charges when a video has been watched for 30 seconds. The conversion of and impression to a 30 second+ view was above 35% for all of our campaigns and on mobile it was 70.32% (not that it mattered because you aren't charged on conversion of impressions).<p>The next day we had 5483 views, 28 likes, and 10 comments (almost all positive), without having paid for the incremental boost.<p>Your point about decreasing value and fake video promotions doesn't hold true with this test nor the experience of other customers. The views are not fake, they come from actual individuals who watch for 30 seconds from legitimate publishers. If they weren't then YouTube could strip a customer of their views as they did with Lady GaGa who lost 156mm views [1]. This hasn't happened once for Virool.<p>If you watch a video for 30 seconds it is highly doubtful that you are ignoring it. Virool doesn't do bottom of the page video pre-rolls that won't be seen but are counted as a charged view. If you are in an app, it seems odd that you would assume every user ignores a video for 30 seconds. You are correct that there will be plenty of people who do ignore, but as a Virool customer I am not getting charged when this occurs so it doesn't seem like a strong argument why their business is flawed.<p>Finally, you may feel that people after 1980 have been conditioned to ignore ads, but if companies like Facebook and Google are making billions in revenue from digital advertising, I doubt that marketers are shoving money their way if no one is looking at their ads. In 2012, US digital video advertising was estimated to be around $2.9bn out of a $37.3bn bucket for digital ad spend [2]. The market is still nascent and there is a continued shift of advertising dollars to online and mobile from the classic channels (print/tv/radio). The market isn't anywhere near saturated and I doubt it will be anytime soon.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/29/lady-gaga-youtube-views_n_2574182.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/29/lady-gaga-youtube-v...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/digital-ad-spending-top-37-billion-2012-market-consolidates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/digital-ad-spend...</a>",1360876974

Over time, after investing love blood sweat energy tears, these places gradually become our homes. Sometimes it feels like it happens fast, sometimes it feels like it takes forever. Sometimes we are embraced by whomever is there before. Sometimes we're not and we displace (ask me how I felt moving to Avenue D back in the day). Sometimes we're not and we're the ones displaced.<p>For me personally, the Haight didn't start feeling at all like home for quite a long time. Years. But over time I started recognizing the shopowners. Getting to know them, their names, where they lived, what was on their mind. And my neighbors (those that stay long enough to get to know). And the cops (on the rare occasion you saw one). And the postal carrier. And the street cleaning crew. Etc.<p>And, especially relevant to this thread, I began to recognize the local transients. I might see a handful guys over and over again who have been walking the streets of our neighborhood for a decade or more. (Which I guess technically makes them in-transient, but they're likely not under the same roof every night like I am.) This is their home, too.<p>But what I <i>don't</i> see is the same faces among the street kids. I see new kids every day. They're here one day, gone the next. It's rare that I'd see a kid last a week. Maybe a handful I've seen come back after a year or two. But that's the exception, not the norm.<p>So my point about it being ""our extended home"" is that, after these many years, love or hate the Haight, it has become my home, and it is the home for the others that have invested something of their lives in our neighborhood.<p>For most of these street kids, the ones the author is writing about, the ones that <i>I</i> see every day, they don't consider it home. They don't treat it as their home. But I do. And so do my neighbors.<p>Does that explain it a bit better?<p>Edit: Moxie in another comment mentions the (true) squatter scene, which is a very important (and itself diverse) subculture to recognize. I agree completely. I'd suggest that the Haight is also their home as much as it is mine. Hell, a million times moreso if we're talking actual blood sweat and tears.",1360876053

Nearly everyone I pitched it to thought it was just a 'thin client' ala Citrix's offering, and Brad Templeton called it a 'diskless workstation' as he knew my history with Sun and Sun's flirtation with that sort of thing in the early 90's.<p>I didn't think it anything like that at the time, thinking instead of it as a sort of appliance like client rather than diskless (it had local flash storage), it was basically what smartphones became, but with a keyboard and display[1]. When Android was being developed and a number of people in the platforms area were getting excited about it, I talked with the Android folks about forking it into something along the ideas of my JaDE concept. They weren't very receptive, they had a phone to build. I did the usual stuff, created a p page [2], put some stuff in the wiki etc. Also saw Jeff Nelson's previous work (which had gone nowhere), read the politics around the whole Android effort at the time and abandoned my efforts to push it any further.<p>Other projects inside of Google with that level of detail did get pushed further by people interested in moving the ball down the road. When one of the platform folks left to join this ""secret"" group which turned out to be ChromeOS I was amused because yet another group of people had figured out what, by then, was a pretty obvious idea. Since I happened to have a compatible ASUS Eeepc at the time I downloaded one of their early builds and played around with it. When they got some traction inside the company the Android group went ape shit (as expected) and that led to some interesting changes.<p>But lets come back to Jeff for a moment. He was at Google for 2 years according to his LinkedIn profile, which means he joined, got slotted, and left. (a common path sadly). But he is also currently the CTO of 'stealth startup' which means he is out pitching to investors with his co-founder(s). Its so much better to pitch as the 'inventor of ChromeOS' than it is as '2 years at Google, then consulting for 4 years.'<p>I clearly remember he had a 'p' page for his project (I found it when I was thinking about my version of the idea) so he may be assuming that someone read it and said ""Hey this is a pretty good idea, we should build this."" And started building it. Since it was never a good idea at Google to give anyone else credit for your ideas perhaps Jeff is making some unwarranted assumptions. I could easily see him believing whole heartedly that he invented it, just like I can believe nobody in the ChromeOS group has ever heard of him.<p>Google is just that kind of place.<p>UPDATE: see the patent claim in a sibling comment, that is priceless!<p>[1] Yet another case of being too early!<p>[2] Internal database of ""projects"" being worked on.",1360875875

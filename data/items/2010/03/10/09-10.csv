The moment she figures out she's earning half the money her peers do she's going to feel taken advantage of and hurt her employer out of spite when given the opportunity to do so.

It's easier to get into a company via someone who <i>knows</i> people there, than just some resume in an email.<p>The trick is just to remember these guys are extremely busy.  If it's more than a week old it isn't relevant anymore, so get a contact within lots of different agencies and contact them on a regular cycle (once a month is probably ok).",1268215155
1180576,comment,1178540,1180476,0,0,zbyszek,,,"Yes and no.  In my experience it is usually a mistake for scientists to try to write fancy prose like a novelist.  I would much rather have a dull but comprehensible paper (all short, plain and simple sentences) than any kind of highly literate ambiguity, or indeed the over-formal pomposity you rightly complain about.  A scientific paper should not be a work of entertainment or showing off, but an attempt to communicate an idea.\nRemember that a paper is written for several audiences, and the annoying crap that you don't care about might be of vital importance to someone else.  Having said that, it is nice when a paper is well arranged so that you can find what you want, but too often you just have to develop your cherry-picking skills.",1268215134

When I was a kid I was mediocre at everything, it was not until my adult life that I became exceptional, now things come easy to me. People look at me as kind of a  daVinci (not claiming I have had anywhere near the impact as him) but the point is, a jack of all trades and a good enough master of them as well. I am never the best, but I am above average on almost anything I take interest in.<p>Anyway, wrapping this up into a point, with the ability to master anything, I stopped looking at failure as failure and looked at it as a proven iteration that does not work. I know it is cliche to say, but perception is reality and if you have a negative perception that will manifest itself in ones actions.<p>One of the big issues is that the human mind, unless trained, is bound to a simple understanding of time. Within that simple understanding is an internal pressure to race the clock. When one looks at time is a more spatial manner then they start to see failure as less about being set back x amount of time and rather that though the distance traveled will require some adjustment one has still traveled a distance and made progress.<p>I cannot stress enough that attaining the right perception can be the difference between success and resignation to defeat. The greatest key to attaining that perception, above all else is creativity.",1268212557

They were rejected because they don't have the CS and programming skills to do the job.<p>The part I would agree with is that learning a new language != getting better at programming.  When you learn a new language, you're increasing your breadth of knowledge - but most employers don't hire for breadth, they hire for depth.  They want you to be good at the job they hire you for.  And when you pick up a new language, you'll perform <i>worse</i> than on your existing languages, until you've had the practice to bring your skills up to where they were before.<p>Instead, spend time learning your language <i>better</i>.  Most languages (even Python) provide different ways to accomplish the same task; try them all out, find out which is best, and most importantly, find out <i>which is best for which tasks</i>.  Learn some libraries in depth.  Write some actual code so you have something tangible on your resume - starting a project from scratching will teach you a lot that maintenance work at your employer won't, and even contributing some patches for an open-source project will teach you something new.<p>A big problem with many candidates is that their knowledge is very shallow: they'll claim to be an ""expert JavaScript programmer"", where ""expert"" means they can only use JQuery snippets they found on the web.  And they don't even realize that their knowledge is shallow; they're completely oblivious to the depth of the subject until they meet someone who really does have deep knowledge (and even then, only rarely).",1268211780

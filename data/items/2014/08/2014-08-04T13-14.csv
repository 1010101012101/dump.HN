There are still some educators committed to true distance learning, but some also who have circled the wagons and who decry such &quot;solutionist&quot; thinking.<p>The really sad thing is that the current battle isn&#x27;t just about this or that &quot;poor&quot; offering in the present, it is against the whole effort.

As mentioned people can change insurance plans frequently so investing in their health can be difficult. While they change plans frequently, the providers they see would be slower change.

8131713,comment,8128654,8128959,1,0,geebee,,,"This comes up almost every time someone questions the need for full medical or law school.  There is a middle ground.  I personally would support multiple paths to the bar (and to medical practice).  I read (and kind of enjoyed) Milton Friedman&#x27;s &quot;abolish the AMA&quot;, but I wouldn&#x27;t really go that far.  I do, however, think that the AMA and ABA exercise far too much power to deny others there right to practice, and I think it&#x27;s healthy to have more than one path.<p>For instance, I recently read about a seismic engineer who attended an on-line law school (Kaplan - the article was in us news).  He will take over as corporate council for his engineering firm, but he will have to take the bar in California.  All other states (minor hand waving here) ban pure online law degrees.  It sounds like a reasonably rigorous degree (4 years, many hours of study, interaction with students and professors), and he had to pass the bar.  How could the public interest possibly be served by preventing this guy from practice?  What 25 year old history major from a 4th tier law school is denied a job because a mid career seismic engineer was allowed to join the bar?<p>I also think that law is particularly unique in that it regulates almost every element of society.  People talk about &quot;broad liberal arts educations&quot;, but I think most pre-law students are pretty narrowly educated (they tend to avoid math heavy majors, and go straight to law school, never really understanding how other fields work).  I think that the ban on on-line learning, combined with an unnecessarily long degree may actually prevent the best people from becoming lawyers - in short, rather than ensuring quality, it may simply ensure a myopic profession that still goes out and regulates everybody else.<p>Would someone with a grad degree from a strong program in engineering or CS and accelerated one year law degree who passed the bar be a threat to the public?  Personally, I&#x27;d much rather hire someone who majored in a very rigorous undergrad field (with humanities coursework as well) and got a grad degree from a top school plus an accelerated law degree than a b- history major who partied his way through a mediocre 3 year jd and barely passed the bar. I also don&#x27;t think that these two groups would compete for the same jobs.  At the very least, I&#x27;d say people should have the option of pursing (and hiring people who pursued) other paths.",1407160671

Obviously we can&#x27;t go prosecuting everyone who intentionally whacks into someone else according to the rules of whatever sport they&#x27;re playing, so we make an exception for that. This gets tricky with sports like boxing where the rules require you to do something that looks pretty much like a brutal assault, so the exceptions in that case get pretty finicky -- we might insist that you make your mutual-battery deals in public, in licensed boxing rings, instead of by giving Brad Pitt a nice manly handshake in the basement of a bar and refusing to talk about it later.<p>And then there&#x27;s the whole gray area of less socially-accepted sports, like Quidditch or BDSM. We (even prosecutors) often approach things from the perspective of, &quot;if this activity seems normal to me, it must be legal; if it seems wrong it must be illegal.&quot; When moral judgments and fear of the unknown creep into that analysis, it can lead to some twisted logic to justify the outcome we know must be right.<p>[1] Now consider whether you can be prosecuted for A&B as an accomplice.",1407158960

I find it more difficult to stay focused on a project that is not well defined, but for ones that are well defined and give a clear picture of the expected end result I can get into the flow for hours as I run off the checklist of things that are expected.<p>I think that ambiguity kills programming production, and in this industry there are copious amounts of horror stories about poorly defined projects.  And I don&#x27;t think that documentation is some sort of mindless work break either, as someone above eluded to.  Being able to effectively explain your code from a technical and/or functional standpoint also takes focus and energy.",1407157789

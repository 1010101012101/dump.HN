After some searching I found someone who took a photo of it here:<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/54568662@N00/1489675763/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/54568662@N00/1489675763/</a><p>It is a very interesting map because it contains the lines of most of the transit authorities in the Bay Area(apparently not all because transit.511.org has more). There are so many that they have to reuse similar colors for a few of them. There are agencies that you probably <i>have never heard of</i> on that map.<p>That is a scary thing and indicates the true scale of the transit problem - so many overlapping interests, no central authority. And looking at the transit agencies alone doesn't even give us perspective on how many other bureaucracies are getting in the way.",1250318309

I am a bit clueless at the moment, but I was wondering whether reading a textbook on the subject helps. I'm specifically considering ""Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (2nd Edition)"" by Anany V. Levitin, or ""Introduction to Algorithms (3d Edition)"" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. Or both. Are these books any good? Are there other books I should read?<p>BTW: As far as programming languages go, I'm pretty fluent in Java and far into learning Python with plans to learn many more languages in the future.",1250318251

764432,comment,763124,764361,0,0,1gor,,,"It's a tough call to come up with 'original thought' in a thread comment. But I can give some pointers about non-linear methods that work.<p>Time delay embedding is a common method to estimate hidden structure in the system. You can make short-term predictions about future state of the system if you look at its previous states and find ones that are similar to current one. You can analyse transitional probabilities between these states. You can also study scale-invariant properties of the system such as fractal dimension or log-time scaling. There is a separate discipline called 'chaos control' that looks at certain unstable moments when the system can be manipulated by a small external signal (very relevant for dealing with heart attacks, should be interesting for central banks as well).<p>So, most categorically, current mainstream economic models are by far not the best we can do with at the time. They are grossly inaccurate representation of reality. There is of course emerging field of 'complexity economics' but it is not even close to being accepted in the mainstream.",1250316666

Forcing every last kid in Chinatown to go to a school at odds with their traditions is an affront to liberty.  Offering the one Jewish family in Hicksville, Alabama the option of (a) moving to a bigger city, (b) commuting to a decent school, (c) homeschooling or (d) putting up with local school they hate the least, is more palatable to me.<p>In most cases, the solution would be, ""don't live in Hicksville, Alabama if you can't stand the schools.""  But even if you have to, at least you have options (b) and (d).  Public schools don't even give you that much.",1250316580

Previously it had been introduced as an option, but now all of our users use HTTPS to secure their email between their browsers and Google, all the time. In order to do this we had to deploy no additional machines and no special hardware. On our production frontend machines, SSL/TLS accounts for less than 1% of the CPU load, less than 10KB of memory per connection and less than 2% of network overhead. Many people believe that SSL takes a lot of CPU time and we hope the above numbers (public for the first time) will help to dispel that.",1453161568

I&#x27;ve grown in my career over the last 15 years from junior dev up to my current engineering management role, and what I&#x27;ve observed was:<p>1) The biggest hurdle in most cases is communication, especially in meetings. That being said, I still do fine in them, because I rely on lip reading as well as vocal cues/context, but I also rely on my coworkers to be understanding from time to time, and they are.<p>2) Slack has been hugely beneficial to me, but it requires the organization to be engaged with it.<p>3) I have accented speech because I drop some consonants (f and s sounds mostly), and it can be a challenge for some to clearly understand me shortly after meeting me. This usually resolves itself after 2-3 weeks.<p>4) Job interviews: I&#x27;m always up front about what I can and can&#x27;t do - this usually comes up around the topic of phone interviews, I can&#x27;t do them. People appreciate this, and I make it clear that I&#x27;m not ashamed or hindered by my disability. The confidence goes a long way. If you come off unsure, then of course others will be unsure. I&#x27;ve definitely had interviews where there was a communication disconnect, but typically that comes along with other circumstances that make the job a poor fit. I&#x27;ve never had the situation where the job/culture/people fit was there but it didn&#x27;t happen because of a communication issue.<p>For other deaf developers out there, just own it and show that there is no hurdle out there that you can&#x27;t overcome, and you will be successful.

10927904,comment,10927396,10927396,0,0,rconti,,,"I think the airlines have had a bit of a race to the bottom in a few ways:<p>* Fees. Charge baggage fees, everyone else does the same, nobody&#x27;s any better off. Boarding is slower and passengers crankier. I was HAPPY to not have to tote my bag around every single layover until they started charging for bags, now I&#x27;m another unhappy customer lugging a bag everywhere, walking up and down the aisles looking for space, having my bag gate-checked (and inevitably lost -- gate checking is the least reliable way of actually getting your bag to its destination, it seems).<p>* Chasing &quot;frequent flier&quot; business travelers. I don&#x27;t have the numbers to back this up, but most of them already seem loyal to their chosen airline to funnel their corporate dollars to, because they&#x27;ve got so many damn miles accrued. But airlines trip all over themselves to throw free shit at the 1% of frequent fliers that they piss off the 99% of occasional travelers. Yes, the frequent flier dollars are very important, but now we have a (very) long tail of less-frequent travelers who can be <i>guaranteed</i> that they will never, ever, ever be offered a free upgrade. You won&#x27;t even get an emergency exit row (see: fees). I hate to sound entitled, but on my honeymoon, I was hoping that, for once, I might get a courtesy upgrade. Nope. I&#x27;d wager that if every airline set aside 2 slightly-better seats for a <i>random</i> upgrade, they&#x27;d get a lot of good word-of-mouth from the average joe like myself. But instead they waste every single bit of effort on the jaded business traveler whose opinion won&#x27;t be swayed that much by small favors, because all of the airlines are throwing free stuff at them all the time anyway.<p>* Space, obviously. I continue to insist there&#x27;s a market to pay 50% more for just a LITTLE bit more space. I don&#x27;t mean economy plus; I&#x27;m not tall, I&#x27;m just an average-sized male. I just want my own goddamned armrest. I don&#x27;t know why the airlines can&#x27;t get this right. Business class 2x2 seating on a narrowbody would &#x27;only&#x27; cost them 33% of seat capacity. 2x3 would even be acceptable, with an offset aisle. On a widebody, even just taking out ONE coach seat would make enough space to give passengers a meaningful upgrade. add a couple more inches of legroom to make it easier to get in and out, and bam, you have my loyalty for life. I&#x27;m happy to pay for a little comfort. I just won&#x27;t pay 5x as much for business class. It&#x27;s simply not in a normal human being&#x27;s price bracket. I don&#x27;t have to pay $100k to get a car that&#x27;s a bit nicer than a Corolla. (see: frequent fliers spending business dollars).",1453161131

It was obvious this wasn&#x27;t working - you sent a message to someone from Skype for iPhone, and they got it... sometime.<p>We knew to have a chance against Whatsapp and other messaging apps we needed server based messaging, so we built it.<p>It took 3 years. Yes, it took this long to get rid of the P2P code from just the messaging components from the 20+ Skype products - we had 1,000+ engineers and 50+ internal teams by the end which significantly slowed things down.

There have been some progress in that area too, like zipcar, that smoothes a few use cases between Uber and full car ownership. It can only also benefit from technology like self-driving to better manage the car pool and seems like a perfect fit for electricity (cities allocate specific parking spot for zipcar, so they could have plug ready there and zipcars are used for small trips). There is no similarly innovative rental model between very short rental and traditional week-end / holiday rental. Regular rental car companies are still operating exactly the same as their where 20 years ago.",1453160390

10927808,comment,10926339,10926339,0,0,mdasen,,,"TTS has definitely evolved over the years.  If you compare Google Maps voice to Stephen Hawking, it&#x27;s night and day.<p>However, I can definitely understand how TTS technology looks stagnant.  Part of this is that going from nothing to something reasonable happened exceedingly quickly.  Early TTS research was supported by the US government which saw that early systems were comprehensible (if not wonderful sounding) and declared victory.  Funding went to other problems in computational linguistics (like speech recognition, information extraction, etc.) and so did a lot of the workforce.<p>Modern systems usually involve many hours of speech from a single person and use variable length units to form more natural speech.  Many systems still sound pasted together because that&#x27;s how enterprise technology goes.  How many banks have online banking that seems like it&#x27;s from the 90s?  You can&#x27;t compare what systems can do to what some call center has installed as its technology.  Someone has linked to Inova.  Google and Nuance have good systems as well, but there&#x27;s a balance between resources and perfect speech.<p>In terms of some of the issues. . . When you&#x27;re going through a finite amount of recorded speech, you have to choose something that fits.  It isn&#x27;t going to be perfect in many cases.  You have to deal with things like F0 declination.  You have to deal with how long phonemes are going to be.  You have to deal with breaks in utterances.<p>And the fact is that we can understand Hawking&#x27;s 1980s TTS.<p>If you want to start thinking about the problem more, try inputting these two statements into Inova &quot;Do you really want to see all of it? Do you want to see all of it? I want to see all of it.&quot;  Notice how it tries to rise around &quot;really&quot; in the first sentence.  It&#x27;s trying to match how we would speak - rising for &quot;really&quot; in the first sentence and rising for the question-ending in both questions.  But it kinda misses in both cases.  Still, in some ways it&#x27;s amazing that it recognizes &quot;really&quot; as something that should go up.  It recognizes that questions go up at the end.  It recognizes how the non-question goes down as the sentence progresses.  And it finds things within its data set to fit to how it thinks the sentence is going to go.  But it doesn&#x27;t have perfect language understanding so it doesn&#x27;t know exactly how things would be said - a lot of sounding natural isn&#x27;t making the phonemes more accurately, but the intonation and attitude of the speech.  It also has to find something that fits.  Lots of smart things are done, but it&#x27;s pulling from a limited amount of recorded speech - speech that has been sliced in many useful ways, but still limited.<p>TTS has definitely evolved and I think that Google, Nuance, and others are definitely pushing it forward.  You&#x27;re going to interact with a lot of legacy systems that feel like they&#x27;re still in the Hawking era.  But most ATMs I use don&#x27;t even have touch screens (opting for buttons on the side of the screen) and even fancy ATMs like Wells Fargo don&#x27;t feel like an iPad.  You don&#x27;t want to compare to systems that are so far away from modern, commercially available systems.<p>There is definitely work being done on it and it&#x27;s definitely become much better.  But to an extent, it isn&#x27;t something that a lot of companies are going to work on.  How big is the market for TTS?  Before you say, &quot;it&#x27;s useful in loads of things,&quot; think about the market for maps.  A lot of it is Google or Apple Maps.  Loads of apps integrate mapping, but don&#x27;t want to map the world or run their own infrastructure for serving it.  Some use OpenStreetMaps, but they&#x27;re really just serving generated tiles rather than re-mapping the world.  If you were to create a TTS startup, what would your business model be?  Pay us money to TTS your text rather than getting it for free from Google&#x27;s Android TTS?  The issue is that TTS is more a feature than a product.  Companies like Amazon might bring a company like Inova in-house.  Nuance sells their stuff to companies like Apple.  Google is large enough to build it.  But you&#x27;d be pitching something that doesn&#x27;t directly solve something for customers and trying to hire very smart (expensive) people who you hope will be able to come up with something new that isn&#x27;t an obvious &quot;with more resources, better&quot; solution.  Remember, TTS needs to be done in real-time, possibly on low-powered mobile devices (don&#x27;t eat their battery or storage) or over the network (don&#x27;t make our AWS spend go through the roof).  If you&#x27;re going to sell to an app maker as a no-network TTS, how much bloat are you adding to the app?<p>It&#x27;s just a hard market to be in given that the 1980s solution works, even if it doesn&#x27;t sound realistic and modern already-available systems are quite reasonable.",1453160087

About 20% of the industry has a leadership that is female dominated of around 70%, 25% is balanced with 50/50, and the rest 55% is male dominated.<p>Inequality in gender distribution seems to only get more extreme each year here and female industries tops the lists with several that has a over 90% female to male distrubution. The very top of the list is a profession with 99.94% female to male ratio, and the whole male group of the profession could fit in a single mini-buss. This is in my view the primary reason why no feminist politician in Sweden ever brings up this yearly statistics, as the facts doesn&#x27;t support the narrative being presented.<p>The changes as reported last report was minor changes in the top list of male dominated profession with about 2 percent increase in females to males, but in the female dominated professions the change goes the opposite direction with ever higher female to male ratio. Some professions like psychology is reporting that at university level it is about 95% female to male ratio, and if nothing is changed soon there won&#x27;t be any male therapists once the last 20% that currently work reach the age of 65.<p>As someone sooner or later always want links:\n<a href=""http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/</a> (you have to build you own query and compare it to previous years).",1453159867

Things have changed a lot over the last 30 years, and I&#x27;ll be very disappointed if they don&#x27;t change much over the next 30.   In 1986, C++, Java, C#, Perl, Python, and JavaScript didn&#x27;t exist.   The web was a small project unheard of outside of CERN.   Much of computing was done in COBOL on mainframes.   Garbage collected languages weren&#x27;t used much.   Things haven&#x27;t progressed uniformly, and in some areas have actually regressed (I miss Lisp Machines), but mainstream computing is well ahead of where it was then.<p>I also don&#x27;t think you can simply graft supercomputing onto mainstream (i.e. Algol-descended) languages and expect to keep all your cores equally busy.

I feel betrayed.....;)<p>(just kidding)<p>I just signed up and am going to work through a few things. I&#x27;ll keep notes as I go, so some of these may seem a little rough, but I hope that they help.<p>First, my environment:<p>- Ubuntu 14.04\n- Chromium 47.0.2526.106\n- Resolution - 1366 x 768<p>and<p>- iPhone 5c\n- iOS 9.2\n- Safari<p>My thoughts:<p>1.) You sign your confirmation &quot;Team Clerk Team&quot;. That isn&#x27;t wrong per se, but it&#x27;s kind of awkward.<p>2.) I know you have only put three days into this, so this is a really shitty thing to say, but when I first loaded this up in mobile, I had to really seriously zoom in.<p>3.) After I signed up (on desktop), I was presented with a tooltip that reads &quot;Click here to create a project&quot;. In my environment, the &#x27;c&#x27; in create is cut off.<p>4.) This may be a time zone problem, but when I created my first project and set it for being due today, it immediately showed up as being overdue.<p>5.) After I started up that project, I created a task and assigned it to myself. When I checked in mobile, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to view that task. In good news, your account settings page looks great in mobile. :)<p>6.) I wanted to test if I could log out of mobile and then assign a task to myself in desktop to see if the task would show up again when I logged into mobile. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to log out in the mobile view.<p>7.) I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to show that a project was completed.<p>Overall impressions:<p>I like this a whole lot - it&#x27;s one heck of a good application considering that it only has three days of dev behind it. With a few little tweaks to the experience, this is definitely something that I&#x27;d use. Great work! :)",1453158684

The interface is really decent, though it pushes Amazon Videos harder than the AppleTV pushes iTunes I feel like. Netflix and Hulu on the latest AppleTV feel &quot;first class&quot; for example. Same number of steps as getting to iTunes content (or one extra if you have multiple Netflix profiles). And the search is universal. Whereas on FireTV the Netflix App is kinda off in a corner and most of the content you&#x27;re presented on startup is inaccessible if you don&#x27;t have a Prime account.<p>Anyways, hardware wise, the latest AppleTV feels more powerful/capable than most devices on that list. Not sure about the PS3 or 360 or original Wii since I didn&#x27;t really use them as media devices, but it&#x27;s definitely much more powerful than the WiiU (I&#x27;ve tried Netflix and Hulu on it for the kids and it&#x27;s nowhere near as snappy or responsive).<p>Anyways, yes, the PS4 (I don&#x27;t have an XBone yet) does most of what the latest AppleTV does. But it&#x27;s less focused and more cumbersome. No voice search for example. The apps seem a bit slower. (Except for Youtube, which is far better than the crippled version made for TvOS.)<p>Not sure where I&#x27;m going with all this except to say the latest AppleTV has it&#x27;s own strengths/weaknesses and is more of a media-device++ than a Console--.<p>My own pro/cons would be:<p>Pro: Boots way faster than the previous version. Just a few seconds.\nCon: Needs to be rebooted every other day or so when apps can no longer play video for unknown reasons.<p>Pro: Board games on the AppleTV with a young family are awesome.\nCon: Not enough of them.<p>Pro: Plenty of age-appropriate games for children. Crossy Road is one of the few games my 3yo and 7yo can really play well together, and the TV experience is great.\nCon: Not enough more in-depth games. Where&#x27;s Kingdom Rush?!?<p>Con: The on-screen Keyboard is the worst ever designed in the history of on-screen keyboards. W.T.F. Apple. Seriously. Especially painful in Youtube since you can&#x27;t voice-search there.<p>Pro: The optional Controller is great.\nCon: It&#x27;s not used to it&#x27;s fullest since most buttons map to things that&#x27;ll kick you out of the current app.<p>I totally get not making the 3rd party controller required.

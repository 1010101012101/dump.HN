Last time I checked, in America a degree conferred no special rights or privileges. I love though how they look you in the eyes and lie to you while they're handing you the degree. Classy.",1187899163

My essay takes the idea that organizations are anti-individual because of their history.  I think there is some merit in both points of view.

The parts about using your personal cash, spending kids college fund, blowing through your retirement account are particularly egregious. The founders of the most successful companies in Silicon Valley sure didn't risk their own money building their empires. If you're starting a (failed) nightclub in Cleveland, maybe it is a different story. ",1187898429

Across cultures, women play an important (and often exclusive) role in the economy -- drying fish or tending sheep or what have you.<p>Women rarely played a role in the macro-economy, true enough; but for much of history, trade within a village was for more valuable than trade between villages or nations. It's misleading to suggest that the <i>present</i> worthlessness of small scale trade implies the <i>past</i> worthlessness of women as economic engines.

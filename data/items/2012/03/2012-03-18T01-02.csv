That alone is so useful I miss it still (MSVC has had the almost equivalent 'code definition' pane for a while, but it's so slow to update it's still effectively useless).<p>Also, to this day it seems like the only code editor that I've seen which doesn't use monospaced fonts, and better yet, utilizes that properly (for example, parentheses vary slightly in size according to nesting level, so it's easy to see at a glance which parentheses match).",1332035915

3718865,comment,3717715,3718378,6,0,Jare,,,"> The original arguments for OO were: it's better for managing complexity, and it creates programs that are easier to change. Both of these turned out not to be true in general.<p>Wrong. Even the worst Enterprisey mess of Java classes and interfaces that you can find today, is probably better than most of the spaghetti, global state ridden, wild west that existed in the golden days of ""procedural"" programming.<p>If you consider that software is composed of Code and Data, then OOP was the first programming model that offered a solid, practical and efficient approach to the organization of data, code and the relationship between the two. That resulted in programs that, given their size and amount of features, were generally easier to understand and change.<p>That doesn't mean OOP was perfect, or that it couldn't be misused; it was never a silver bullet. With the last generation of software developers trained from the ground up with at least some idea that code and data and need to be organized and structured properly, it's time to leave many of the practices and patterns of ""pure"" OOP and evolve into something better. In particular, Functional has finally become practical in the mainstream, with most languages offering efficient methods for developing with functional patterns.",1332035895

He's an illustrator/character designer and needed a text editor on Tiger (old laptop) for editing html/css/etc.<p>We tried very hard to find an editor that wasn't vim.  I looked around.. textmate sounded nice but it was only free for 30 days.  Lots of other apps simply didn't run on Tiger.<p>So we ended up downloading macvim.  He picked it up and was able to be productive the same night with very little coaching.  Coincidentally, he has wrist pain from mouse abuse so having a keyboard-centric interface is incredibly helpful.<p>I'm a vim expert and my gut feeling to avoid vim ended up being completely wrong: he had no problem understanding it and was almost immediately productive.<p>Thank you macvim developers for not forgetting about the little guys with old OSes!",1332035894

3718839,comment,3714269,3715040,1,0,pron,,,"Oh, no. Again with the ""choosing"". Since I read similar arguments quite often here on HN, I want to give a general, rather than particular answer. The short version is, people under duress can't really ""choose"" anything, even if it may seem to some free-market capitalists as if they do.<p>Let me paint a fictional picture for you. Say there's this island that's been ravaged by natural disasters and famine, and its entire population is starving. Rich people from a nearby country realize the islanders are in real distress and will be willing to do a lot for anyone who will save them from certain, horrible death, so they decide to use them as workers. So the rich people set up shop on the island, and the locals start working for them. Some of the rich people pay the workers (each of them producing, say $100's of product a day) with one loaf of bread, oh, and they also rape the women. Some pay their workers $2 a day, and they don't rape the women. Naturally the locals love the latter group, while that group of rich people from the mainland describe how they've saved the poor islanders from certain death and have even treated them rather humanely - well, at least compared to some others. They praise the wisdom of the market who let them gain from the islanders' cheap workforce, while letting the islanders survive.<p>Now, this (fictional) story is not about China. It's about anywhere an impoverished population, or anyone under extreme duress, lives. Speaking about choice under such conditions is preposterous. People will choose a quick death over slow mutilation. People will choose enslavement over annihilation. Believe me, there's no ""free will"" at work here, and whether or not the rich people from the mainland have done any good to the island, they certainly have nothing to brag about because they're exploiters who've saved a population merely to enslave it.<p>My story is extreme and I am not making any direct comparisons. I <i>am</i> saying that poor people are not ""free"" and they most certainly can't ""choose"", and if they do have a sliver of choice in their miserable lives (akin to the choice an innocent man might have for his last meal before execution), there is certainly nothing for anyone here to be proud about - certainly not about providing them with ""alternatives"" (like commuting the innocent's sentence to a life of forced labor).",1332035112

Their UX for slicing and dicing based on person, label, project, etc is also nice. The search is faster (it's all client side so it's practically instant). The charts make more sense to me. It doesn't treat stories as a unit of work; rather they are a goal.

It's only when we hired a couple of people and they pointed out frustrations with Pivotal that I started looking around.

  2. a defined set of operations that can happen on instances
     of those data attributes.
</code></pre>
If you are opposed to classes, which of these characteristics are you opposed to?  Since I think it would be pretty much impossible to be a programmer and be opposed to structs or tuples, it must be the latter that you don't like: giving structs an associated set of methods that operate on them.<p>But having a set of methods that define the state transitions that are possible on an object is incredibly useful, for so many reasons.  It helps organize your code.  It provides nicer, more intuitive syntax.  But most importantly, it reduces program complexity by narrowing down the set of code that can directly modify the attributes of an object.<p>Without this encapsulation, any piece of code anywhere in the program could be modifying data attributes in any way, and it is extremely difficult to reason about the state transitions that any particular struct could be taking.<p>There is no rule that says classes have to be in any kind of hierarchy at all, and in fact ""prefer composition over inheritance"" has been common wisdom for years now.<p>I recently rewrote a very useful but hard to follow JavaScript library in a more object-oriented style.  The old code has a bunch of maps everywhere that can be read or written by any part of the code, and it's very difficult to follow.  In a more object-oriented style the structure of the code is far more obvious, and the state transitions that each object can take are far more clear.",1332033221

One fairly common pattern is to try to import one module, and if it's not installed, to go for a backup. For example, if I need to parse JSON, the simplejson library is significantly faster than the (completely API-compatible) standard library ""json"" module:<p><pre><code>    try:\n        import simplejson as json\n    except ImportError:\n        import json\n</code></pre>\nI'm pretty sure I've seen those exact four lines of code in the internals of Tornado and Flask, among others.",1332032475

My experience has been that the hallway conversations are alone worth more than keynotes.<p>Many keynotes sessions tend to be disappointing because there is not enough time to dive into technical details, or the presenter is not sure if they should be focusing on the movement as opposed to their technical contributions.",1332032467

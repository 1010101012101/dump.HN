Your average sedentary individual would not be able to complete the 7 minute workout.  If they were signicantly overweight they would likely collapse 2 minutes into it.<p>The goal of this type of training is to yield the greatest amount of impact with the least amount of effort in the shortest amount of time.<p>Anybody who did the nyt 7 minute exercise at max intensity for a couple months is going to be in good shape.  Do it everyday for 6 months and they will be in the 90th percentile of physical fitness in the United States for their age group.<p>Which I think is a pretty good return for 7 minutes out if your day with no equipment other than a chair.",1414220391

I realize this does make me a bit of a weirdo in our post-enlightenment world.<p>Using emotions instead of reason suffers all sorts of problems. The most easily characterized, and shocking to the mainstream, are things like empathy being racist and sexist.<p>But there are deeper problems - emotions are often just plain inconsistent. We will feel different things depending on the framing of a situation, our own mood, relative status of other people involved in the situation, etc. This also makes &quot;cheating&quot; easier. The core problem with empathy is simply that it&#x27;s an appeal to emotional decisions over reason.",1414220367

That seems kind of unlikely, given that a) that seems pretty egregious for a library like this, and b) they said this doesn&#x27;t affect the application at all beyond consuming &quot;a few bytes&quot;.<p>Could it instead be just that Google scans Google Play apps for a string in the binary that matches the Flatbuffers version string format? That seems more likely given what the README does say about this. And it also seems more useful in general; Google would benefit more from knowing how many applications use the library than knowing how popular these applications are.",1414220318

That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that Poland is a state in search of security like all others, borders countries it regards as untrustworthy (Russia and Belarus), and has a largely flat topography that allows armored assault by those countries.<p>Of course you can argue that being a part of NATO means that they are under the US nuclear umbrella and therefore it is non-rational for them to invest money in military hardware. However a nuclear umbrella depends entirely upon the protector nation being able to credibly communicate that it is willing to use weapons in the defense of the client nation. This gives the client nation incentive to demonstrate that it has a spine of its own and is willing to pay a reasonably high cost to defend itself. Otherwise, who would believe that the larger nation would defend the smaller when push comes to shove?\nWhy else would Poland have gone to war in Iraq?<p>The winged hussars are still silly, but a well-known elite cavalry unit doe support the narrative that Poland is a bulwark of the alliance against an assault from NATO&#x27;s traditional enemy.

A \\ (aka SPLIT) starts a new line at the current indentation. If it&#x27;s immediately after indentation (aka GROUP in that case), it represents no symbol at all (at that indentation) - this is useful for lists of lists.<p>5. A $ (aka SUBLIST) in the middle of list restarts list processing; the right-hand-side (including its sub-blocks) is the last parameter of the left-hand side (of just that line). If there&#x27;s no left-hand-side, the right-hand-side is put in a list. This useful abbreviation from Haskell simplifies many common cases.<p>6. A leading traditional abbreviation (quote, comma, backquote, or comma-at) or datum comment &quot;#;&quot;, at the beginning of a sweet-expression line, and followed by space or tab or end-of-line, is that operator applied to the following sweet-expression. Otherwise, it applies to the next neoteric-expression.<p>7. The markers “<∗” and “∗>” surround a collecting list, and MUST accept a list of 0 or more un-indented sweet-expressions. The “<∗” and “∗>” represent opening and closing parentheses, but restart indentation processing at the beginning of the line.

8507362,comment,8501530,8507101,0,0,hackuser,,,"> What is the mortality rate of the flu versus ebola? When I assess risks related to ebola, I tend to favor a more cautious approach, because the mortality rate is so high.<p>I think that raises a several good points. A few considerations:<p>1) The &#x27;proper&#x27; way to evaluate risk, as I understand it, is (likelihood * cost). A 10% chance you&#x27;ll lose $100 costs you $10 each time you take that risk, over time.<p>2) I agree that some costs are so high that the math works poorly even with low likelihoods. A 1% chance of death is far too high a risk to take, unless there is some high payoff such as saving someone else&#x27;s life -- a risk the infected doctor and nurse took.<p>3) The cost of Ebola is that high, but the likelihood is so infinitesimally low that it&#x27;s still not worth worrying about. You&#x27;ll add more life years exercising or simply reducing other risks with the same time spent thinking about Ebola. It&#x27;s a complete waste of time (I realize the irony of writing that! :) ).<p>4) There are many more equally deadly and far more likely risks for healthy middle-aged people: Lightening strikes, natural gas explosions, being shot in the head, carbon monoxide poisoning, food poisoning (of certain kinds), other contagious and non-contagious diseases, etc.<p>5)\n> When an individual spends time with ebola patients, they should be advised to avoid situations where they would expose a large number of people to the pathogen ... This seems like an unreasonble amount of risk to me.<p>Generally I agree that we should minimize risks, but again I&#x27;m not sure there is one here:<p>* It&#x27;s very possible that it&#x27;s very safe. Nobody in the United States (in fairness, that we yet know of) has contracted Ebola in this manner from the infected 3, though two of them spent much time around others. Also, wouldn&#x27;t Ebola be rampant in the hospital where the infected nurse worked, if this was a risk? Wouldn&#x27;t it be rampant among medical staff in W. Africa, given the prevalence in their environment (higher than flu in those facilities)?\n * HIV spreads via bodily fluids but we don&#x27;t quarantine the infected or their caregivers. However when HIV first become known, people were afraid to be near the infected (resulting in a lot of discrimination). I think we should not repeat that mistake.\n * I would guess that hospital workers encounter many contagious, deadly diseases, yet nobody worries about those spreading.<p>People want to treat Ebola differently despite many similar and much greater risks. That&#x27;s why I believe it&#x27;s fear and not real risk that drives it.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m approaching redundancy. Good talking to you!",1414217178

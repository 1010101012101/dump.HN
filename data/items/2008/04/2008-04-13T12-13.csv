Most things are: a lot of crap is produced for everything worth keeping.<p>""Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it - whole-heartedly - and delete it before sending your manuscript to press.

They are completely different in the way I use them. the EEEPC sits in my car for if I need it whilst travelling around. The iphone is for picking up stuff whilst I'm out, at dinner, at friends etc. The iphone is in my pocket and it my calendar, address book and all the other things I need instant access to. Whilst the EEPC is great in terms of form factor, its a computer and not what the iPhone is",1208091426

162368,comment,162035,162035,0,0,subwindow,,,"This is what happens when you confuse technical complexity with product success.  A complex product, or one that takes ""more than a weekend to build"" will not necessarily be successful, and a simple product will similarly not necessarily be successful.<p>It has much more to do with demand.  The wheel isn't terribly complex, nor is it original.  Yet, if I came out today and started selling wheels, I could probably sell a few thousand.  There's a demand for wheels, and so it makes sense to sell them.  I think that in this age we forget this part of the equation way too often.",1208090220

And often I don't even know whether that actual version is the actual version I'll continue with; I just get a feeling at some point that I've got it right.",1208090121
162365,comment,162304,162304,0,0,wallflower,,,"Sometimes the rule is even broader: this is what happens when you let your company design the UI (before bringing in a HCI/Ux (user-experience) consultancy to fix/transform it).<p>Aside from griping with them about the backend machinations/magic required to transform some of their wireframe mock-ups into running code, working with a well-known HCI/Ux firm made our product's UI cohesive, <i>usable</i>, and functional. They also helped us build reusable common UI components. This was a high-profile, multi-million dollar new product launch so the ($$$) money the firm cost was well invested.",1208089943

162363,comment,162304,162304,0,0,subwindow,,,"It is kind of unfair to say all programmers are bad at designing interfaces.  I've never personally met one that was actually bad, and know several that are quite good- to the point where they could be professional UI designers if they wanted.<p>I've noticed a trend where hackers with good design sensibilities have migrated to working on web earlier than other developers.  That might have something to do with it.",1208089690

162359,comment,162341,162341,0,0,truebosko,,,"I agree. I had an idea about 3-4 months ago to create a new service for the local community. I wrote it all down, discussed it with a friend, went back and forth, then for awhile it was dead, just a big document sitting there.<p>I came back to it about a month later and re-evaluated many things, and thought of newer, more clever ways to do certain things<p>Then I came back to it again about 2 weeks later and finally wrote out my ""concrete"" plan for Goal #1 and what I want done before moving onto the next phase.<p>As of writing, Phase #1 is almost in completion. Basically, just like your story, letting the idea sit for awhile gives you time to think it over, see how you can do things different, and get feedback so I think it's pretty valuable in some cases",1208089035

162357,comment,162066,162183,0,0,notauser,,,"Your first point is essentially meaningless. It makes no difference if it is a division, a child company, or part of the core business. Someone has to think about it, manage it and execute it. All this costs money which you could use elsewhere _and_ it creates potential conflicts of interests with your own business. This means that you need a really good reason to go ahead.<p>For an example of conflicts of interest look at the Windows/Office vertical integration and the constraints placed on Office in order to keep Windows profits high.<p>Your second point boils down to the fact that social networks give an awful return on investment. Could be true, but if so that's more of an argument to get out of social networks altogether and find a more profitable business.",1208088892

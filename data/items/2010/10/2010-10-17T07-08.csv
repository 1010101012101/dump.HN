If you want to do anything in that 5-10% -- you have challenges.<p>Woz wanted power and flexibility and options.  Jobs wanted beauty and simplicity and ease of use.  There's nothing wrong with simplicity.  In fact - most of the time it's a benefit.  But lets call it for what it is -- Apple's design ethos will choose simple over flexible almost every time.",1287302227

1799887,comment,1797964,1798669,0,0,DisposaBoy,,,"Ant, waf, and the rest of them are usually overkill IMHO. With makefiles the basics are simple and straightforward and I'd argue that most uses only require the basics, it's like what I've been hearing about autotools these days but even autotools seems overkill especially on Linux where we've had proper pkgconfig support everywhere for years. The same is probably true for the BSDs as well. I can't comment on Windows or OS X as I have no experince there but I imagine it must be easier to write a couple basic makefiles for 2 differnt platforms if you need. Most cross platform projects don't need as they either use Gtk, glib, Qt, etc which already pulls in all their dependencies.",1287302031

You use 'timesteps' as the size of the 'knapsack' since the number of balls is unbounded. At each timestep, you cannot determine the the optimal solution to the subproblem and you'd have to save every possible ball combination.<p>TL;DR - It gets to be a pretty messy/bad backpack and should probably be solved another way",1287301754

Then web apps could have used Flash's JS if it were available and just run more slowly if it weren't. Since V8 runs far faster than AS3 (in any measurement I've done), this was obviously technically possible. Had Adobe done this, Flash's extraordinary ubiquity would have meant we had access to something like V8 in nearly every browser out there, right down to IE6. Instead, what they produced was a dead end -- faster than the old JS implementations but not as fast as the new ones -- and a monstrosity called ExternalInterface that makes interaction between JS and AVM2 too slow for all but the most expensive computations.",1287301740

I would rather write algorithms that simulate the cellular environment as you said, but in this case wouldn't it be better to follow a path like this? Using the money to focus on what you need to learn and working with people who actually know what they're talking about?<p>It's fine if you get into an awesome college like MIT and Stanford where you can do something analogous to this through UROPs, but what about those kids who can't afford it? Wouldn't this be a golden opportunity to them?<p>Yet again, just like in college it depends on what kind of person you are. If you want to just chase dollars then you really might be better off in school, but if you want to work hard on hard problems and actually make a contribution. Then this just might be the best thing in the world. For example, where I live an undergrad doing research is unheard of. It's pure sanctimonious nonsense. Students are expected to mug up for exams get good grades, get a job then go do their masters. Or, do a MBA and then.... Well I guess you get the drift.<p>What happens to someone passionate in a grind like that? For someone like that Peter Thiel's endeavor might actually make a lot of sense.",1287301719

The reason I say this even though you're starting ""barefoot"" is I notice that the vibrams have enough padding to have a slightly different feel for me than actually going barefoot, so it might be worth testing it out and seeing if you notice a difference (if so, try to maintain the barefoot stride while wearing the shoes).<p>Good luck on the 5k, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",1287300392

I get downvoted all the time for my position on full client side browser apps. Which to me is the silliest thing to downvote someone for and it seem to be the big one. Not my position in general, but technical dogma in general. It is a form of group think and I think at a certain level it is inescapable.<p>For example, guy (A) like Apple guy (b) does not. Each provide their reasons and both are valid points as to why each holds their position, but many times that exchange will result in a third party that agrees with one downvoting the other. I don't understand why people equate ""i don't agree"" with ""I need to downvote"" but it happens and it leads to group think.<p>Given that, similar post receive higher scores while opposing views get suppressed, by the would be poster out of fear of reprisal or from downvoting. There are some key ones that are pretty common obviously Apple is a big one. NoSQL vs Relational is another. Anyway, this does make individuals second guess expressing there real opinion on a subject for fear of being downvoted.<p>If a system could be designed to identify someones bias and make the weight of their down votes and up votes count less for items they show a bias for, I think you could kill some of the group think and fear of reprisal. Also I think downvotes from a users page should be track with particular interest. I do not think it is rampent but I have seen instances where one user is targeting another user with downvotes by visiting their profile and downvoting their threads. I had it happen to me on two occasions one of them I pinpointed who it was because only the posts that the user had not replied to me had been downvoted, given that you can not downvote a post you replied to it was pretty obvious who had done it. Anyway, I think there are some ways that a system could be built to identify downmoderation abuse and weaken or remove those privileges.<p>For myself personally, I say what I think if it gets downvotes then so be it. If I get downvoted to oblivion guess what? The community just validated that it is not the right community for me and it is time to move on. Either there is too much group think or I just have nothing valuable to provide to that community, either way why would I want to hang around.

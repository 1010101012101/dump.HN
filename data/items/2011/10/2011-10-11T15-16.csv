Anonymous objects can be used to insert anonymous functions into Java code...  At great cost in verbosity.  Variables never really escape Java ""closures"" but the resulting immutability leads to a functional programming style that has real benefits.<p>Javascript's real advantage is a clearer syntax that's easier to learn and easier to read.

Maybe more in cases that are trivial to do with rails.<p>The nightmare I've seen happen with Ruby projects is that the ""developers"" are often web designers who know how to do things that are easy (or trivial) to do with rails,  but get in over their heads rapidly.<p>Python,  on the other hand,  has a culture of doing the 20% of the work that gets you 80% of the way to production,  announcing that they're done,  moving on to a greenfield project,  and then laughing at the ""Blub"" programmers in PHP and Java who work so much harder to get things production-ready.<p>Java's greatest strength,  on the other hand,  is it's greatest weakness.  Java has a huge number of libraries that make it possible to do wonderful things,  like Lucene and Hadoop.  There's ""more than one way to do it"",  which means that real-life systems might have 5 different JSON libraries used in different parts of the system.  A programmer who needs to work on a small part of an application might need to wait for Maven to download 650 megabytes worth of JAR files.

This illustrative article from 1998 gives another data point: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/1998/08/babysitting_the_economy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/19...</a><p>The more theoretical explanation why governance is necessary is roughly as follows. While our living standards are ultimately only concerned with <i>real</i> wealth, the fact of the matter is that our economy is driven by moving <i>nominal</i> wealth around, i.e. it is driven by flows of money. If we ignore issues of fair distribution for a moment, our <i>real</i> living standards depend very much on how much money flows per time as aggregate demand towards buying things.<p>But <i>flows</i> of money add to and subtract from the <i>stocks</i> of financial assets of individuals. And since every financial asset you own is somebody else's liability, your ability to accumulate net financial assets is limited by others' willingness to incur net financial liabilities.<p>Now economists like to theorize that those things balance out nicely in equilibria, where the desire to accumulate net assets and the willingness to incur net liabilities somehow are matched by a market. In practice, however, the paradox of thrift occurs.<p>This is because (a) the real world does not actually work the way that those particular economic models say it does, and (b) even if the real world did work that way, the conclusions rely on assumptions about how uncorrelated the individuals in the market are. Particularly in times of crisis, the behavior of individuals and firms tends to be highly correlated indeed, and you end up in a kind of Prisoners' Dilemma, where nobody wants to be the first person to incur liabilities, but because of that, the flows of money dry out, and because of that, the real living standard decreases.<p>A governing body can break this kind of symmetric behavior by unilaterally deciding to incur additional liabilities via spending.<p>Note that I implicitly assumed in my argument that your goal is to provide for the society's real living standards, and I subordinate economics to that goal. I realize that many ""sound money"" advocates do not think that way, though I've never really understood why.<p>I recognize that the governing body can also cause a huge amount of trouble, but limiting that trouble is what democracy is for.",1318346022

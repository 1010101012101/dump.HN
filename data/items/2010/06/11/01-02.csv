This is pretty interesting but I'm not sure about your example of Kitty Genovese. ... but I think it's one of ""boy who cried wolf"" more than ""herd mentality""</i><p>From experience I say this is good example of compliance. The message in group situations like this is <i>""don't get involved!""</i>, <i>""I'm panicking""</i>, <i>""I'm scared""</i>, <i>""what can I do?""</i> - resulting in inaction instead of action.

They do one of three things - fight, flight or freeze. Most reacting to their base level of training - that is, freeze. I've seen it first hand - they either freeze or move away, eyes averted. It still haunts me today. You can see the people who are trained. They are the ones reacting and running forward towards the trouble.<p>Reaction, doing something requires you to cast aside compliance and do what needs to be done regardless of the consequences, social or otherwise cf: <i>""Stockdale Paradox""</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.jimcollins.com/media_topics/brutal-facts.html#audio=59"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jimcollins.com/media_topics/brutal-facts.html#aud...</a>",1276220855

Took one foray into product development, MeasureMap (acquired by google).<p>Pivotal Labs - have one product, Pivotal Tracker, that's been well received but doesn't seem to generate revenue. Good reputation as Rails consultants.<p>MailChimp - Now just a product but was originally The Rocket Science Group doing web development.<p>37signals - All product now but originally was a consulting partnership. Not sure what happened to the original partners. Seems like only Jason is still active.<p>ENTP - Rails consulting and makers of Lighthouse.<p>I only have anecdotal info on those companies, but have a few thoughts.<p>The biggest seems to be that you need to have provisions for handling new and leaving partners. For example DHH is new to 37signals but got cut in enough that he now owns a Lamborghini. It seems important that you could allow for that.<p>On the leaving side, I think at least three of the original Adaptive Path partners have left. AP is still going strong, so you know they did the partnership in a way where they aren't burdened with non-contributing partners taking all the profit.<p>On the other hand, those three partners left to start their own startups, so there was something in the dynamic where doing product work required leaving. I think this might have been a lesson they learned during MeasureMap. They were so big that only a few people were working on the cool sexy project and I think it might have caused conflict.<p>I think the other big issue is leadership. I think AP had a rotating CEO position. I guess other partnerships might have a more clear leader. But regardless of the structure, I'm pretty sure that you need to make sure there's a clear and transparent accounting system that everyone buys into.

1422405,comment,1422107,1422107,0,0,mikeleeorg,,,"Back in the day, before the dot-bomb, there was a site that did something similar. A few sites, actually. I think one of them was iWon (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWon</a>), which offered points for performing certain actions on various websites. Others followed a treasure hunting model. You had to find certain pieces of content, or perform certain actions, to get points. They monetized by signing up partners (since this generated visits) and advertising.<p>That being said, I think this is an interesting idea. With Foursquare, Gowalla, and others having popularized the ""check-in"" idea, the market could be ready for this kind of a service again. If you can build a system to prevent gaming, you'd have a good, defensible product on your hands.<p>I think it's definitely worth a try. You can even scoop up some of the previous ideas (treasure hunt, rewards for actions, etc) and incorporate them too.<p>Good luck!<p>[Edited & added some more info below]<p>Ah, I just recalled a few other attributes of the iWon system. They started with a portal page and rewarded you for clicking on certain links. This obviously is different than visiting a website whenever you wanted and checking in - and I think the latter model is better.<p>They also had a time restriction. You could only perform a certain number of clicks a day, and perhaps even a certain number for hour. Those may not stop people who write scripts to game your system, but it's an element you can consider.<p>I'm guessing you've already considered the social aspects of this too, yea? For example, check-ins could appear on Facebook, Twitter, etc. If your system included a friends concept, I could see which websites my friends like to visit, and perhaps go there too.<p>BTW, if you can pull this off, you'll also end up with a great database of user behavior. You'll know who the users are (Since they signed up on your site), you'll know which offers & sites they like to visit, and you'll know how frequently they do so. Not that I'm highly recommending this, but such a list of users could be very valuable to marketers.<p>As the website owner, I'd love to be able to contact my visitors. Some sites may want to offer visitors free content, free stuff, easter eggs, etc. As a marketer, I'd love to know who visits my competitors, or related sites, so I could offer them incentives to use my service instead.<p>P.S. I wonder who'd become the mayor of Hacker News ;-)",1276219278

If he's insulted to hear me point out that he's not a security researcher, I'm surprised.<p>The process of ""responsible disclosure"" gives product managers latitude, because it effectively dictates that researchers can't publish until the vendor releases a fix. The vendors almost always decide when to release fixes.<p>When a researcher publishes immediately, vendors are forced to fix problems immediately. A small window of vulnerability is created (""small"" relative to the half life of the vulnerability, which depends on all sorts of other things) where less-skilled attackers can exploit the problem against more hosts.<p>On the other hand, in the ""responsible"" scenario, many months will invariably pass before fixes to known problems are released. During that longer window, anybody else who finds the same problem (and, obviously, anyone who had it beforehand) can exploit the vulnerability as well.<p>Furthermore, full disclosure creates a norm in which vendors are forced to allocate more resources to fixing security problems, instead of waiting half a year or more. This costs vendors. But the alternative may cost everyone else more. It depends on how well-armed you think organized crime is.<p>Finally, Robert, there's the issue nobody ever seems willing to point out.

1422368,comment,1420731,1421956,0,0,gxti,,,"Market pricing appears random, but it is not because of a random number generator deciding when to go up and when to go down. It appears random because prices actively resist the formation of patterns, and a chart with no pattern by definition appears random. If a trader recognizes a pattern in a stock that is 100% guaranteed to play out they can borrow heavily and put it all into trading the pattern and walk away with a huge profit. If there's even a small probability that a pattern will play out, then a trader can place a proportionally small bet on it and still have a significant edge over everyone else. But the act of trading a pattern works to counteract the existence of the pattern: if the pattern predicts that the price will go up, then people will buy, thus driving the price up and making it harder for others to jump in until the profitability of the trade evaporates.<p>Now imagine 10,000 people (and robots) all doing this simultaneously. This is how markets work at the micro level. It may sound like a self-fulfilling prophecy but it happens so fast that the pattern never really exists to begin with -- it's just a way to explain why there are no patterns.<p>At least theoretically. Most traders (by head count, not dollars) haven't the tiniest idea what they're doing. Luckily, these ""noise traders"" all tend to counteract each other, and when they do manage to push prices off-course then someone who does know what's going on steps in and pushes things back in the right direction, making a profit in the process. Sometimes there are catastrophic failures, but while they might scare investors they don't affect the ability of the market to predict pricing long-term. The broad markets recovered extremely quickly during the flash crash and without any regulatory intervention.<p>As for whether the random walk means the pricing is ""noise"": the market price is an estimation of the fundamental value of the company, which is an imaginary number that is impossible to calculate but is occasionally pinned down when someone gets bought out. Because it is an estimation, and because the fundamental value is also ever-changing due to uncountable external factors (interest rates, consumer confidence, phase of the moon), the result looks like a random walk. It's a noisy estimation of an imaginary number. Neat, huh?<p></wall-of-text>",1276218223

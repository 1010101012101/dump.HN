Good tech support is a must for mission critical APIs.<p>At HelloSign we take great pride in our API and our tech support. Rather than outsource support or rely on less technical people, we have our developers directly support the API they built. So when you give our API a try, I encourage you to check in with one of our developers by visiting our public HipChat room (<a href=""https://www.hipchat.com/gq4BMFKt1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hipchat.com/gq4BMFKt1</a>) or emailing them directly at apisupport@hellosign.com.

I have a lot of respect for EchoSign and their original CEO Jason Lemkin, but I do think the API was an afterthought for them. At HelloSign we think it’s the future and are committed to having the best-in-class API.<p>I also wanted to touch on your point about wanting to work with &quot;a company with a soul&quot;. This is something I also look at when making buying decisions. I’ve found a company&#x27;s Glassdoor reviews to be an effective barometer of how well a company treats its employees and, by extension, how its employees treat the customers.

It&#x27;d be better if there were objective metrics for measuring everyone&#x27;s value that both sides could understand, so they don&#x27;t devalue each other.

It just means that your colleagues might be able to see the outcome of that negotiation. Even with salary bands you still need to determine where in the band you land on day 1, and those bands are often wide enough (10-15%) to allow quite a lot of flexibility. Also, most &quot;large corporations&quot; will have many job descriptions and titles indicating seniority: an Engineer II will have a wildly different salary band from Principal Engineer, leaving plenty of room for negotiation on hire.<p>Second, there is basically no way to determine that someone is a &quot;10x&quot; engineer (if such even exists) via an interview. Decades of studies across the industry have shown that interviews are a terrible means of assessing potential performance, and unless you&#x27;ve worked with someone on an essentially identical product in a similar company before you can&#x27;t predict their output now. (Also, see above re: strawman argument about not being able to move $20k for an exemplary candidate.)<p>Third, if you can&#x27;t build trust across teams (with or without visible salary info) you have much deeper problems than your comp being public. Fix this before everything else. If you&#x27;re building &quot;cohesiveness&quot; by implying to your staff that every other teams makes less money (and is therefore less valued) you&#x27;re setting yourself up for real problems down the road.<p>Finally, salary negotiation is a very different beast than feature and scope negotiation. The former assumes a selfish if not antagonistic stance (&quot;get as much as I can&quot;) while the latter should be collaborative (&quot;deliver the best possible outcome given our constraints&quot;).

Finally, when I started my own startup (and was doing heavy consulting in the beginning) I decided to take all the spare capital I had and invest in a &quot;top of the line&quot; Macbook Pro.<p>I got a deal through a third party apple reseller and still paid around $2300. This was late 2012 and I am still typing on it today with no desire to upgrade. 3 years on one machine is an eternity from me.<p>I got the 512 SSD so I could run multiple OS&#x27;s and not worry about still having room for any media I might want. I <i>still</i> have ~80gb free with all my mp3&#x27;s and VM&#x27;s. 16GB of ram and a retina display as well.<p>I get the &quot;apple hate&quot;. I really do. I have 3 laptops total in my life (Chromebook Pixel and Debian HP Stream 11 which serve very different purposes) and I still feel that the OSX is the best Unix based operating system for productivity in my market (startup/web development).<p>Maybe when Linux display tools wrap their head around high dpi displays, my opinion will change (Chromebook Pixel handles it very well so it must be coming!) but I really urge anyone who says &quot;I personally will not buy anything from Apple&quot; to reconsider why they&#x27;re saying that.<p>Even Microsoft is making some pretty awesome choices these days, so I for one would never rule out the possibility of someone woo-ing me.<p>..a brief aside on the price... if I bought this for $2300 in December 2012, then I used it for all of 2013, 2014 and 5 months in 2015. 29 months of use. That&#x27;s $79 a month invested in the thing I MAKE MY LIVING with. The price is only bad if you compare it to other &quot;comparable&quot; laptops. If you can get 3 years out of a $1,000 laptop without it slowing down your work, then props to you. I personally never could do that (even with other apple devices. Just try and think about the big picture when you purchase your dev machine, whatever make/model it could be :)",1430519485

In fact the mono patent situation remained unclear for years, until 2009 if I remember correctly.
And in 2006 there was the whole Novell-Microsoft kerfuffle, with Ballmer saying that only Suse Linux users were not violating Microsoft intellectual property <a href=""http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/2006/11/16/ballmer-on-novell-linux-and-patents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/2006/11/16/ballmer-on-no...</a>.<p>So I really would not call the reaction FUD.<p>Also, adding my personal experience from that period, I&#x27;d say that many Linux desktop users, myself included, were not interested in adding mono as another dependency to the stack, especially to run three applications: a note-taking application (tomboy), photo management (f-spot) or the banshee music player(which, I&#x27;m sorry to say, was one of the most crash-happy pieces of gnome).
Samba and ffmpeg (well, the patented parts thereof) were never meant to be building blocks on which to write a lot free software, they are ways to ensure compatibility with existing closed solutions.
I have some simpathy for de Icaza&#x27;s idea that, since C# is a nice programming language, people should be encouraged and helped to use it, but the combination of patents&#x27; threat and frankly the &quot;let&#x27;s just put it in gnome!&quot; approach doomed the effort.
Also, in hindsight, mono would have (has?) worked better in the entreprise sector, rather than in desktop environment (Ruby is about as open as it gets, but it is not used for DE&#x27;s stuff, execpt YAST2 I think).
Hopefully now that most of the dotnet stack is open (except the bits that do depend on windows e.g. WindowsForm, if I&#x27;m not mistaken) we&#x27;ll see a rebirth of interest.",1430519233

[2]<p>- Most notably is Twitter&#x27;s Zipkin[3], which is what the rest of my comment will make comparison of (but take note I haven&#x27;t used Zipkin extensively, I&#x27;ve only researched it).<p>Zipkin is written in Scala, and Appdash in Go. Depending on which you&#x27;re familiar with might make your decision between the two easier. A language you know and love goes a long way for hacking on a project.<p>On a user-interface side; they&#x27;re both pretty similar. I think Zipkin is getting an aggregated data view sometime soon, but Appdash already has an extensive one with several different viewing modes (see screenshots in [4]).<p>I don&#x27;t know Scala too well and couldn&#x27;t determine during my research how extendable Zipkin is -- but Appdash was designed from the ground up with interfaces providing core logic: this means you can swap out where the traces get stored (in memory, evicted after a certain time, in a database, your own custom implementation, etc), define your own event types with their own meta-data associated with them (an HTTP event has headers, an SQL event has the literal query that was run, your own type could have anything you want, etc).<p>Appdash has a Python support library so you can generate traces from Python applications, too. This works because it uses Protobuf for communication. We hope support for more languages might be contributed. IIRC Zipkin uses Apache Thrift for communication, but doesn&#x27;t officially support integration with other languages via libraries.<p>A really useful feature of Appdash that I think Zipkin doesn&#x27;t have is the ability to import and export single or multiple traces as JSON from the UI. You can literally copy+paste traces to co-workers, etc, and they can load them up in their own Appdash instance to analyze them if they want.<p>Perhaps missed among all my discussion of HTTP-esque-tracing-systems is that Appdash is really suitable for analyzing the performance of any application at a high-level (i.e. not micro-benchmarks). If you can time something, want to log something, or have something important with a timestamp on it -- you can just give it to Appdash and it&#x27;ll display it in a nice UI for you.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3197490"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3197490</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://twitter.github.io/zipkin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.github.io/zipkin/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/sourcegraph/appdash/pull/58"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sourcegraph/appdash/pull/58</a>",1430518962

Just yesterday I was talking to the person who contributed WebGL support to Servo (a relatively recent and substantial patch), and they reiterated this sentiment. It was their first time ever using Rust, and although they&#x27;d reluctantly done some C++ in the past their primary programming language is Javascript. They were pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to contribute such a large patch, and had bountiful praise for how well-organized the codebase is. The patch actually bounced a few times, and they were also very pleased at how the core contributors continued to work with them over the course of days to track down the breakage and keeps things moving.<p>This person&#x27;s primary interest is in virtual reality, specifically WebVR (<a href=""http://webvr.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webvr.info/</a>), and given Servo&#x27;s incredible benchmarks so far they&#x27;re very optimistic about its ability to advance the state of the art of virtual reality on the web.<p>Their biggest complaint was build times. Yeah... we&#x27;re working on that. :)",1430518905

9474876,comment,9472523,9474232,0,0,lmm,,,"Category Theory is about the fundamental similarities between superficially different constructs, so is very applicable to programming (which is really all about abstracting commonality/patterns from things). It suggests abstractions that can apply to a wider variety of programming problems. E.g. I wrote a &quot;survey&quot; of effect handling in a few languages recently, <a href=""http://m50d.github.io/2015/04/21/effects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m50d.github.io/2015/04/21/effects.html</a> ; almost all of those examples can be handled with a monad or similar abstraction.<p>Coming at it from the other, &quot;pragmatic&quot; end, in <a href=""http://m50d.github.io/2013/01/16/generic-contexts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m50d.github.io/2013/01/16/generic-contexts.html</a> I abstract out a particular interface from two similar problems, which turns out to be that of an Applicative Functor.<p>Once you have these constructs you can use theorems from Category Theory to tell you things about them, but honestly I found the most useful part was having this &quot;library&quot; of standard abstractions - almost like design patterns really. More immediately there&#x27;s usually an actual library of functions that you can use on your own types. E.g. by defining a Monoid instance for my Stats class, I can foldMap a list of things to get the overall Stats for the whole list.<p>More complicated example: I have two reports which are fiddly and client facing, but have some code in common. So I have a parent class and two subclasses, but the control flow goes back and forth between them; in particular there&#x27;s a point where the parent class needs to loop over a list, calling a subclass-specific method for each element.<p>Trouble is, those methods need to do slightly complex things. For one client, we get that part of the report from a web service, so we need to make an async HTTP request for each element (blocking for each call would make it terribly slow). For another client, they need to accumulate Stats for each element in the list and put them together for an overall Stats.<p>Both these things can be hard to treat as a &quot;normal&quot; method call. We could e.g. keep the Stats in a global variable, but that would be confusing to debug and hard to maintain. We could have some service that pools HTTP requests, maybe, but this would be extra code and again it would have to act as a pseudo-global variable.<p>But Monads are the abstraction that lets me treat both these effects the same way - and crucially, to handle them with &quot;ordinary&quot;, refactor-safe values, at no risk of spaghetti code. The superclass is generic in the &quot;context&quot;:<p><pre><code>    abstract class AbstractReport[F[_]: Monad] {
      def perUserStep(userId: UUID): F[UserResults]
      ...
      def sendFinalReportToClient(finalReprort: F[Report])
    }
</code></pre>
and then in one subclass perUserStep returns a Future[UserResults], and in another it returns a Writer[Stats, UserResults]. The parent class can do the generic parts of the report working with either of these things generically, using the Monad abstraction; the subclasses just have to implement sendFinalReportToClient in a way that &quot;unpacks&quot; the &quot;boxed&quot; report in a context-specific way.",1430518797

I fear that this move would dramatically hurt startups, who need all the flexibility they can get. Moreover, this move could dramatically kill any form of cohesiveness in startups. Lastly, this move would de-emphasize the importance the skill of negotiation, which would be a detriment to the company.<p>To those who don&#x27;t know, most large companies already have a structured pay table. Try working at AT&T or McDonalds, and you can probably predict where your salary will be in the next 5-10 years. Real negotiation for most people in most positions mainly happens in small firms and startups.<p>Lack of salary negotiation will only scare away well qualified candidates who don&#x27;t fit some arbitrarily made rubric (which will almost always back out to years worked, which is a terrible standard). Imagine if by paying 20k extra, you can get one of those mythical &quot;10x rockstar&quot; engineers. Would you remove your ability to hire him?<p>By opening up everyone&#x27;s salaries, it will only hurt the startup culture, as it will only make people dislike each other. I often found engineers and business development people devalue each others work, in large part because neither party can understand the work of the other. Imagine them knowing each others salaries! Each side can find a justification on why they are being under-compensated while the other over-compensated. Startups need cohesiveness to survive.<p>Lastly negotiation is a valuable skill in the workplace. Interviews reward people who can handle stress and negotiate. Imagine a shipping date is imposed upon you, and not all the features can be included. You&#x27;re going to want a leader on the engineering team to negotiate with the strategy makers to find an equitable solution.

In cases where there&#x27;s a large variation in productivity between employees with the same role, it&#x27;s not going to be possible to pay them commensurately in a system with fully transparent salaries. So this seems to only really make sense in roles where individual contributions are too tied up with group performance to disentangle, or where they&#x27;re very hard to measure.<p>Objection 2: To the extent that perceived relative pay is the variable that actually matters for determining how happy someone is with their compensation (ask someone in NYC versus someone in Mumbai with the same cost-of-living-adjusted salary how rich they each feel), then releasing salary information can be welfare-reducing even if it does cause salaries to rise in general. This is one of the strongest arguments opposing income inequality: the existence of very rich people makes everyone worse off by making them _feel_ poorer.<p>Related hypothetical question: If every worker were paid exactly proportional to their actual productivity, how much would the standard deviation of labor earnings increase?

W&M staff have a lot of control over the legal system in Virginia - they practically set Supreme Court policy, which controls lower courts too; they control the Virginia State Bar; they have a lot of influence on the state legislature which set the laws of the state.<p>Virginia is no hero for mentally ill people.  Some people are homeless and without income because of mental illness, and until this year, the only &quot;medicaid&quot; available for those people (who did not care for children) were sterilization services (see &quot;Plan First&quot; at VA DMAS.)  This means that the eugenics program against mentally ill people that Virginia is known for is still ongoing - it&#x27;s merely only optional now.  Virginia has closed the majority of their state mental institutions and leave these cases to be dealt with by the criminal justice system: basically the theory is to let them devolve into criminal activity then send them to prison.<p>I think that some mental illness is the result of child abuse.  Although child abuse and neglect have been statutorily defined as criminal acts, they are not meaningfully prosecuted in practice.  Since the mid-1970&#x27;s, it has been the law that a wide classification of government employees, from school employees to police officers, are bound by law to report any suspicions of child abuse, but in practice none of them do that, and until several years ago, these employees were liable to no criminal penalties for ignoring that law.  I have tried to find cases of people prosecuted for violating this, and have found none.<p>I think that WMU&#x27;s influence over the state government is ridiculous and the results of it are disgusting.  The school does not deserve its stellar reputation.  I would not feel the least bit of sorrow if it were dissolved.",1430517859

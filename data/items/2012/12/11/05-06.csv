Each approach has their sweet spot regarding total # of orders and picks per order.<p>- Cartonization - the system looks at an order/shipment and determines the best set of boxes to use ahead of time rather than letting the picker ""eyeball"" it and potentially have to re-pack into a different size (or waste a larger box and extra packing material).<p>- Task Interleaving - which is basically about coordinating your warehouse workers to prevent them from moving around without doing some work (called dead heading).<p>- Slotting - arranging goods in their most optimal locations.  This is a complicated subject, but can be as easy as looking at historical orders to see what products are commonly combined and physically placing them near each other (to reduce picker travel time).<p>As far as accuracy:<p>- Pick-to-light systems are expensive, but tend to increase accuracy and efficiency.<p>- Handhelds coupled with software that enforces scanning location and SKU barcodes (i.e. picker scans source location, source LP, enters quantity picked, and scans target LP).<p>- Adding a weight verification step.  Your WMS can come up with a theoretical weight of a given container based on what it thinks is in the container.  You can throw a Mettler-Toledo PS60 scale inline on your conveyor that leads to your shipping station/dock/trucks and compare the calculated weight against the actual measured weight and double check if its too heavy or too light (within a tolerance).<p>I'm the product manager for a Warehouse Management System - if you'd like to chat more, feel free to email me at my HN username @gmail.com, and I'll respond from my work email.  I love talking to people in the industry - I always learn something new.",1355205509

From the US side, it seems that Japanese labels haven't been too generous with releasing their content overseas.<p>As explained in this article by The Verge[0], the Japanese are still very much tethered to physical media. They regularly rent/buy CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs, for reasons discussed in the article, which has kept profits high in the Japanese entertainment industry, compared to the West. <i>Physical</i> album sales have actually <i>risen</i> 11% in Japan in 2012, compared to 2011[1].<p>This, combined with the Japanese market's size and the almost complete absence of piracy there, has obviated the need for Japanese artists to embrace the internet or market their products abroad. Korea, on the other hand, has a much smaller population, and one for which piracy is a way of life. Korean artists are thus forced to market abroad, and in fact get 80% of their profits from Japan[1].<p>Among domestic Japanese groups, on the other hand, there has also been a reliance on various gimmicks to boost physical single and album sales. For example, AKB48, a girl pop group with dozens of members (originally 48 of them), holds yearly elections (<i>senbatsu</i>) to determine the order in which the members are ranked. You get one voting code for each physical copy of a particular single/album that you buy. There are crazy fans that will literally buy thousands of copies of a single CD in order to repeatedly vote for their favorite member, so that member wins[2,3].<p>0: <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/15/3628376/japan-digital-content-ecosystem-hulu-country-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/15/3628376/japan-digital-con...</a><p>1: <a href=""http://seoulbeats.com/2012/12/worry-for-the-right-reasons-k-pop-and-kohaku/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seoulbeats.com/2012/12/worry-for-the-right-reasons-k-...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://blog.livedoor.jp/kinisoku/archives/3425353.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.livedoor.jp/kinisoku/archives/3425353.html</a><p>3: <a href=""http://getnews.jp/archives/119107"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getnews.jp/archives/119107</a>",1355205294

I have studied this particular area of attack for many years, ie monotone circuit theory, & think it is one of the most plausible lines of attack on P vs NP, hence my playing <i>devils advocate</i> for this proof so far. even if there are holes, which frankly, is the most probable case, it may either prove something new about monotone circuit theory, and/or raise awareness/interest in this particular direction of attack.<p>would like to see the opinion of experts who know about monotone circuit theory, which is a deep area with very many substantial results & think there are few who are really qualified to judge these results. even Phds in complexity theory may not be very familiar with monotone circuit proofs.... they are some of the most complex, arcane/abstruse, but even award-winning proofs in TCS.... (hence some of their plausibility in attack).... it seems possible to me the author has avoided all the basic traps and that only some other experts in the area can find the holes after careful study....<p>and note in the paper that there is a big difference between assuming statements that cannot be proven, and outright false statements. the author may actually have some pieces of the proof that cannot be proven as he thinks, but are not known to be false, and these can be turned into new substantial conjectures! that is the process of mathematical development....",1355205100

I recall Khan Academy also having very useful videos explaining a lot of terminology (Salman Khan used to be a trader)<p>For example, in SLV:\nLiquidity: How easy (read: cheap) it is to open and close a position. If the spread on an option is $33.00 (sell) and $33.33 (buy), you lose 1% (most people say $0.33 - I prefer to look at the percentages) just by getting in and out of a position regardless of your trade (I'm ignoring commissions), and assuming the trade reliably goes through instantly. The higher the cost (time, risk of nonfulfillment, money) of opening and closing a position, the more illiquid the position is.<p>In the context of houses, the time and effort and money put into maintenance and time and uncertainty involved in buying/selling, etc make them extremely illiquid investments. If you own AAPL stock and it crashes, you can hit a button and sell it. If you own a house and the housing market collapses, good luck!<p>If I were to invest the cost of a house in some high-volume stock with a tight bid-ask ratio and sell it two years later for the same price by hitting a button on my phone, my losses are just the bid-ask difference and I was never really at much risk of being unable to sell it instantly (during market hours at least).

So many people were starting up, and Visa was cracking down hard on charge backs.<p>The biggest issue back in the day was Content licencing, which with today's whole DMCA crap, I would expect it to be far worse on a user-generated content site. If you licensed images for a specific domain and they appeared on another domain you owned, you would have legal representatives sending you emails (most of the time you would just do a deal with the owners and extend the license). This wasn't the result of the content being found by the owner, this was from organised firms that were hired just to scan images and videos looking for specific sets that they represented. When I hear about user-generated content sites these days, I think of one giant nightmare when it comes to content.<p>It's easy enough to throw something together and try to make some money from advertising, but to be successful in that industry boils down to 3 things. Traffic, Quality and Retention.<p>- You won't get subscribers without Traffic (fairly simple). If you think that you can get organic traffic off the bat, think twice. You'll need to set up some deals with guys who own key domains to have them funnel traffic through to you. (I don't know if this sort of market still exists, but I can't see that it would have died off)<p>- To convert the subscribers you need Quality or unique content (which the successful sites will usually do in-house or through companies that will work with them to produce unique content). If you're going to throw up a few galleries of cheap $5 content sets that everyone has seen before, you're not going to get the conversion.<p>- Retention, is a tricky one. Back in the day you used to count on the subscriber, doing a one off then forgetting stinging them with a re-bill or two, or three. Then when they got their bill they were too embarrassed to challenge they usually silently cancelled. As I said before, around the time I left, Visa was starting to really crack down on charge backs as subscribers had actually grown a pair and started wanting their money back. The only way to fight this is to offer what you advertise and more. You won't keep everyone happy, but you'll see a nicer charge-back rate.<p>For the record, I was a coder, I wasn't the guy behind the camera, or even the guy that designed the sites. I dealt with the systems, and kept them running.

If you can somehow anticipate a positive change in a local housing area, buy a house there and then sell it after the change occurs, moving to a cheaper, less desirable house, you can indeed make a profit. However, this requires two things: a) that you correctly anticipate the change and b) that you don't want the change for yourself. The nice thing about this play is that even if the change never occurs you still have a house.

If you charge a fixed rate for a product or service you exclude the users where the wealth created is less than the rate charged, aka the marginal consumer. You can improve this by charge lower prices for the marginal buyers. You can then do a similar thing for very high value consumers. This is why Microsoft sells so many versions of Windows.<p>In the real world price discrimination is very crude. Consider that Microsoft only has ~6 versions of windows, that is only 6 discrete steps to covers the several magnitudes of value created for users.<p>The reality is there is no algorithmic way to determine the marginal apps.

If you look at Android's income statement you can see that search and advertising is where the big profits come from - something Apple doesn't really have (yet), and Microsoft don't have a sufficiently large installed based for (yet).  The $1.63 ARPU is monthly not lifetime and the data is more relevant in showing that the revenue from Android users is increasing at a rapid clip.<p>Apple is grabbing a large chunk of profit once from the most profitable consumers.  Google is grabbing smaller amounts of profit but from a far larger number of regular users on a monthly basis.<p>At some point the larger Android installed base will mean some number of users will match the profitability of an Apple user's biannual purchase.  There is no requirement for a one to one match.<p>If Google had not done Android then Apple/Microsoft/RIM would have been able to exclude them from the mobile market, which is on its way to becoming the relevant market.<p>As for Motorola, I don't know.  Google can't treat them specially otherwise they will alienate existing Android partners.  There is already the Nexus program for providing the unadulterated Android experience, which presumably keeps prices low due to volume.<p>Other than patents, Motorola would only provide leverage if existing Android partners did not want to play ball on something but there hasn't been any evidence of that happening either.",1355203966

They run the store.<p>On the other hand, it seems like Amazon should be able to sell books, Dropbox should be able to sell space, etc., without paying 30% -- otherwise it's financially impossible.<p>But if you allow apps to sell content within without paying 30%, then all of a sudden all apps become free, selling ""upgrading functionality"" within, and the app store is no longer viable for Apple.<p>You can't even make a rule like ""reselling 3rd party content is exempt from the fee"", because apps will claim additional functionality as 3rd-party. You can't make a rule that ""content accessible on other devices is exempt from the fee"", because gamemakers will just make their in-game purchases accessible on the Android version too, or something.<p>Can anyone think of a clear, unambiguous rule that would allow things like Dropbox, Skydrive, Amazon, etc. to get around the 30% fee, but without allowing loopholes that would allow everyone to skirt it?

I use awk and bash for a lot of that stuff because it's what I happen to know.<p>Other people I know use perl.  The important thing is to be able to automate anything non-trivial that you will do more than a single-digit number of times.  One time I spent 30 minutes writing a script for things that a dozen people were doing a dozen times a day.  It maybe saved a minute each time, but that's over 2 hours in the first day we had it.  It paid off in time for me in 3 days, and probably less than that it terms of ""damnit this is boring""<p>For me, at least, Python has a much higher friction to get from ""here's the list of what I do"" to ""here's an automated version""<p>I do use Python for some of the more involved things (manipulating timestamps from bash is a pain), and I've converted some bash scripts into ""real language"" scripts when things started to get hairy, but most of the time, you get 90%+ of the time savings from the first 1% of effort.",1355202703

It stimulates creativity and you can do whatever you want with it. If you want to play with cars you can make em out of Lego. If you want to roleplay, you can make buildings and use the Lego minifigures! Doesn&#x27;t that give you the best of both worlds? Heck, even if you&#x27;re not interested in building your own stuff from scratch, a lot of sets are tons of fun, and all they require you to do is follow instructions.",1444597189

Proc. int. Conf., Bordeaux 1970, pp. 48-57 (Karger, Basel 1972). It is interesting to compare its 1970 proposals with the current situation, 30 years later. I have decorated it with footnotes commenting on the 1970 situation and making comparisons. Some of the improvements advocated in the paper are still yet to come. I claim quite a few prophet points for it.&quot;<p>Some notable mentions in this paper:<p>+ Worries about ways that the Internet as we know it might not have happened. (eg. Getting stuck in the compuserve trap.)<p>+ Paid for publishing model that we still don&#x27;t have because micropayments are broken.<p>+ Self publishing for authors in the vein that Amazon now allows<p>+ The possibility of the system allowing for Orwellian editing because of centralization.<p>+ 3D printing/computer controlled manufacturing as a service.<p>+ In-depth discussion of the realities of resource usage and costs of computer hardware at the time of writing. (Eye opening if nothing else as to how indebted we are to Moore&#x27;s law.)",1444597189

You typically see it after raising a round, as a way for investors to protect against founders immediately leaving a newly funded company with shares that have &quot;real&quot; value now. Bringing on your CEO isn&#x27;t that kind of event; the reverse vesting only protects the new CEO, and he&#x27;s not putting in a real investment up front (an investor is putting in $X dollars today; your new CEO is building equity over time like you guys).<p>You and your technical cofounder should be compensated in equity for the two years&#x27; work you put in.

My sister was extremely good at math and science... until the end of middle school, when she started hanging out in earnest with her friends. Her friends thought that any intellectual interest was nerdy and stupid, and my sister acted accordingly. Now, the girl who was easily learning algebra in elementary school &quot;just can&#x27;t do math.&quot;<p>I think that the big difference in STEM is that nerdy boys exist in such a number that they can still get acceptance and support. It&#x27;s not as normal as, say, being a football player, but male nerds aren&#x27;t exactly rare.<p>In contrast, because there are much fewer female nerds, their awkwardness is even more exaggerated, and this feeds back on itself to heighten the pressure to conform. Boys find some support in numbers, and their interest in the subjects smooths over any discomfort. Girls don&#x27;t have any of that support, so if they aren&#x27;t absolute fanatics about the subjects, they&#x27;re going to conform.",1444597006

If you want to make non-geeky spaces for tech, go ahead and do it. But lots of geeks do like tech, and they understandably make geeky environments. Why can&#x27;t everyone, as the bumper sticker helpfully puts it, coexist?<p>I think they can. But I also think that the association of geekiness with tech isn&#x27;t a random quirk of history, but rather indicates a common origin. The kind of personality and psychological profile that predisposes one to an interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics also predisposes one to geekiness.

People might be more willing to give genuine advice about this in a non-public forum.<p>There is a certain amount of legitimate paranoia which comes on anyone who is technically competent and starts thinking about security and the systems most people trust without question. This sounds like the place you are now. Once you start thinking about it, it won&#x27;t go away, and you will learn to manage it.<p>Don&#x27;t use the word &quot;they&quot; when you think about who can intercept your calls or hack you. That ways lies unhealthy paranoia, where anyone can start to seem &quot;off&quot; or &quot;acting weird&quot;. Even without that bias, bringing up anything that might imply your cell provider not securing their network will confuse a call center employee at best, or put them on &quot;careful what I say&quot; mode because that way lies legal liability for them. Not sure if that&#x27;s what happened, but it&#x27;s one explanation.<p>There definitely exist people and groups in this world that can hack you in a variety of ways: legally (FBI using a warrant), probably legally (NSA without judicial approval), or illegally (criminal hackers). Most likely the first two don&#x27;t care to attack you, and the latter have no reason to risk performing an attack on you unless you recently made some shady enemies. If you care to do so, you can minimize the number of such groups by using end-to-end encrypted technologies like FaceTime. Google is allegedly working on end-to-end encrypted calls, as well, and has included WebRTC into Chrome. Signal by Open Whisper Systems and Firefox Hello by Mozilla also provide e2e crypto, if you prefer open source things.<p>Realize that the challenge you&#x27;re facing is both technical and psychological. Start thinking systematically about security. If you think your phone is hacked, ask &quot;how did it get hacked, and how do I prevent this with my next phone?&quot;. Did the OS get rooted, or is it just one of the apps that could be acting weird? Cell phone makers spend a lot of resources securing their manufacturing, hardware, software, and platforms, and it&#x27;s really expensive and risky to perform an attack on someone who follows best practices.<p>That said, don&#x27;t imagine that you can be secure all of your systems against everyone all the time. Angela Merkel can&#x27;t, and she has way more resources than you do. Security is all about increasing the cost and risk of an attack and decreasing its value, something worth integrating into your lifestyle regardless of whether you&#x27;re a target now.<p>Finally, about schizophrenia: there&#x27;s definitely stigma there. Don&#x27;t worry about it. Read the DSM [2] to understand what symptoms drug manufacturers target in their drug trials. The point of the categorization is for medical treatment, not judgement, and it&#x27;s none of anyone&#x27;s business except the people who you choose to tell. If your security concerns get so bad that they interfere with your daily life more than you want (i.e. you can&#x27;t work or have close relationships), get diagnosed and meds to help you get back on track. Based on your writing, it doesn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;re suffering from anything that will require you to be on meds for a long time, even if you choose to use them. A doctor or therapist can be a good advisor in this regard, as can friends or relatives if you can find someone qualified.<p>Stimulants like Adderall are in some ways the opposite of anti-psychotics, so that definitely won&#x27;t help you.<p>Good luck!<p>1. <a href=""http://www2.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Intranet/Homefront/Criteria_Schizophrenia.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Intranet/Homefro...</a>",1444596279

There was only so much you could easily learn from playing around with the system.  At some point, well written technical documentation was, if not required, <i>extremely helpful</i> in making connections between how systems worked together, or explaining exactly what a component was or was not capable of.  I don&#x27;t think this is inherently worse or better, just <i>different</i>, and with its own advantages and disadvantages.  For example, people who went through this training seemed to have a very high base-level of understanding of how to configure these systems, what they could or could not do, and how to troubleshoot them, but not necessarily how they <i>functioned</i> in every case.  Conversely, the loosely coupled individual components of traditional UNIX service handlers (sysvinit, inetd) promoted people learning how the actually work, and what they do, but with scattered and not entirely comprehensive documentation on how they worked.  The average person responsible for using these will have vastly different levels of skill and knowledge about them, but with that comes how it actually functions, because that&#x27;s needed to troubleshoot problems, since it&#x27;s so exposed.<p>The feeling I get mostly when reading about systemd is that it&#x27;s very much in the vein of MS products.  Like I said, that isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but it is very different than a lot of UNIX admins are used to.",1444596034

They don&#x27;t search for keywords, they don&#x27;t use the + and - operators, they don&#x27;t enquote snippets of text that should match exactly, no they ask a question, starting with how/what/who/when/where and sometimes even add a question mark at the end!<p>If i were to find out who is starring in a movie for example i would search for the movie title, click on imdb and browse through the actor-list. If a non techie would do the same thing the query would be something like &quot;who was the lead actor in X?&quot;.<p>Now translate this into replying to a comment in a bug tracker, google has thousands of engineers just working on interpreting &quot;stupid&quot; queries, there is no way this type of AI can scale and work against some arbitrary API to a bug tracker maintained by 5 people.<p>Discoverability of available commands is also still an issue, not even solved by google. In their case people only know about one command because there is only one: search. If you were to add commands such as &quot;create task&quot;, &quot;reply&quot;, &quot;send email&quot;, &quot;tweet&quot;, how would that even work, is it first interpreted as a search query about how to send emails and then it suggests opening your email client?

They hate advertising in general. They would block it everywhere if they could. They know it&#x27;s engineered to manipulate them, often with lifestyle advertising it&#x27;s engineered to manipulate them into feeling worse and promising to sell them the cure, but it&#x27;s always engineered to manipulate them in some way. The psychological techniques are very good, better to just block it than falsely assume you can be exposed and then will it into having no effect.<p>2. It&#x27;s their computer so it will do whatever they want it to. Remove ads, remove other parts of your site, remix your site, redesign it, remove all your branding completely, etc. These are the more technical uses with a lot of plugins/userscripts but when you show it off to less technical users they want it too, although it&#x27;s not available to them yet.<p>It has become a good litmus tests to see who mentions the problems with advertising in general and who sticks with the constructed narrative of &quot;Is it OK to steal content to protect your private information?&quot;.<p>I agree, I would have expected Mozilla (even though I know they are ad supported) to not fail this particular test.",1444595200

I spent a good 15-20 years just bashing Microsoft for sucking (legitimately so, I might add), but somehow, with their new CEO, Satya Nadella, they have managed to double down on their core strengths and make products people want.<p>The biggest problem with Microsoft was the massive lack of core integration of the OS and the hardware, there was no synergy. Major hardware manufacturers would invent standards that OSes (Windows or not) had trouble dealing with, and any time Microsoft tried to force a standard onto manufacturers, unless they could get Intel to bite, the standard would either fail, or be badly implemented in every possible way.<p>Windows now has their own core devices that are <i>designed</i> for Windows, by Microsoft, from the ground up. Windows for phones are now a first tier product that <i>is</i> Windows, something more than merely being the iOS to Windows&#x27; OSX. And, unlike OSX, I am still free to run Windows on any computer I choose to buy or build (including my MBPr, if I choose to) <i>while</i> still being able to choose tightly integrated product lines like Surface <i>without</i> either being second class citizens.<p>Microsoft, internally, seems to treat Surface and Lumia like their Pixel and Nexus. Product lines that are top tier and show other manufacturers how to build products worthy of Windows.<p>Does Apple try to build an ecosystem other people get to belong to, even though they want to? No. Does Google do that? No, for the opposite reasons, you CAN use their APIs, but no one wants to.<p>Microsoft just wants my money, and makes it as easy as possible for me to give it to them. Apple wants my money, but wants ALL of my money and won&#x27;t let me realistically integrate it into my existing pile of devices. Google wants my money (I think? Do they? Sometimes I question this), but doesn&#x27;t have a complete ecosystem that makes sense.<p>And Linux? I ran that as my primary desktop OS for 15 years. Linux on the desktop is a dead dream to me, Gnome 3, and PA, and SystemD, and CFS/cgroups, and all this other weird shit that no one ever wanted just sort of killed it; and I hoped that at least Wayland would come in and finally unfuck the underlying windowing and rendering system (ie, making all the work poured into Mesa/Gallium/DRI3000/etc worth it) just... didn&#x27;t happen. I still adore Linux on the server, but, yeah, no, it doesn&#x27;t belong on my desktop anymore.",1444594784

Let&#x27;s move on, acknowledge the network effects of systemd, and build something that can feasibly be the shinier, newer, better, securer systemd. Which might even be based on an existing system like s6. But then the path forward has to be either improving systemd or replacing it, not continuing with sysvinit.<p>I am in practice a pro-systemd person, but that&#x27;s only because my realistic alternatives, for my use case, are sysvinit and Upstart. I have no idea how I&#x27;d start to build a system that used something like s6. I would happily admit there is extensive room for improvement in systemd, but we UNIX folks have been working with worse-is-better and rough-consensus-and-running-code for decades.<p>If the general consensus is that a systemd-style service manager is great, but it should not be pid 1, that&#x27;s an argument worth making, but I don&#x27;t see much focus in this article on that.<p>If the general consensus is that everything can be done with sysvinit, this article doesn&#x27;t make that case at all.

During WW2 pretty much all these jobs were filled by women.<p>Computing and IT started to come of age during the post WW2 boom so there would have been a lot of women with the math background to make programming and working with computers somewhat of a logical next step in ones career.<p>Coincidentally, these woman who had math backgrounds were also some of the fist to have their jobs automated out of existence (the woman who calculates someone&#x27;s insurance premium is replaced with a box of punch cards).<p>Just speculating but it wouldn&#x27;t be a stretch to see how when choosing between going home or switching careers the woman who didn&#x27;t become the stereotypical 50s-60s housewives as their jobs were automated found new jobs writing punch cards (programming) and operating computers.<p>(i&#x27;m in a hurry, probably lots of grammar mistakes in that)",1444593993

Understanding the nature of &quot;what&quot; the software does is often more important than &quot;how&quot; to test.<p>&quot;How&quot; you test will be impacted by other things as well. Some environments (companies) have a need to formally record testing. Others use &#x27;non IT people&#x27; to run the testing. Some have expert users who know the app inside out as &#x27;testers&#x27;. etc etc The need for how much detail is in the test scripts, and in fact if you document manual test scripts will depend on nature of your company.<p>You will find a couple of schools of thought on &quot;how&quot; to test. ISTQB is formal and has a good bag of technique, the other school of though has some good ideas (like session based testing) but IMHO tends to throw the baby out with the bath water. The ISTQB technique can be applied in an agile environment what you would not use the documents they describe.<p>What I have personally found is that a good tester picks up ideas, techniques (BVA, EP etc), and applies these where the will return the best value.<p>I see the arguments in the testing world a bit a kin to dev&#x27;s fighting over strongly typed vs. loosely typed.<p>Automation is good BUT if you don&#x27;t know what you need/want to test then really it is a means to get is a mess really quick.",1444593944

It&#x27;s brave and commendable to ask this question from your position.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is your case, you should to talk a psychotherapist and/or a psychiatrist, but some of the details of your story (like picking up on details like the pace of talking from a wireless company representative) remind me of my mother. She thought there was a worldwide conspiracy against her, with the CIA involved, and so on. One example: she was active in a Blogger community, and someone connected to her network wrote this mundane blog post about visiting the zoo with his family, written in a witty style and with pictures of animals. My mother thought this was a concealed attack to her well being. (&quot;I am obviously the giraffe in this story&quot;, etc). There was no way to make her see how absurd that was, that was her perception of reality, and she wouldn&#x27;t budge from it.<p>Unfortunately, even after having seen doctors and having spent time in a mental hospital, she continues to deny that she is unwell. She is too proud and too stubborn to be open to the idea that her perception is mistaken, or that she has an illness, or that she is not at the center of the world. Her illness along with her pride and stubbornness has caused our family a lot of pain. Imagine your mother or your sister or your wife, not just becoming mentally unwell (that is tough but fixable), but denying at all costs that she is unwell, and so letting that illness define her character going forward.<p>So for me, whether or not you have a health issue, you taking into consideration what your family is worried about, is commendable. Please stay open to what the people who are close to you and who care about you have to say.<p>I wish you the best of luck friend.",1444593908

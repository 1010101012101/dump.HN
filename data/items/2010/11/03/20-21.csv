Most of the cannabinoids and other intoxicating agents have been consumed by the first inhalation.<p>Can you cite any evidence for the claim you've made?<p>Will exposure to passive marijuana second hand smoke result in a positive marijuana test?\nThe most common excuse for a positive marijuana test is, ""I was around some people who were smoking pot."" Research has shownthat casual exposure to marijuana smoke will not produce a positive test. A person really has to work at being exposed to ""passive"" smoke to create a positive test. Very close confinement, without ventilation, with several smokers, for a period of over an hour, may result in a low, but measurable amount of marijuana in urine and blood. This demonstrates that even though the person may not have directly inhaled the smoke from a marijuana cigarette, they inhaled enough second hand smoke to get high. In our opinion, if a person tests positive for marijuana, the issue of whether they smoked the marijuana directly, or whether from intense and prolonged exposure to second hand marijuana smoke is irrelevant. The reasonable choice should be clear!<p>From: <a href=""http://www.drug-testing-kits.com/drug-test-faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drug-testing-kits.com/drug-test-faq.html</a> which is probably not a good source but it's the best I could find through Google at the moment.",1288817665

In my case, I chose a community college followed by a state school followed by a new job.<p>The choice to go to school is debatable, depends on your money situation. Out of the five years it took me to get my Computer Science bachelor's, I had only about ten really worthwhile classes. The rest just seemed like going through the motions. I think it would have been different if I had picked a different major.<p>On the other hand, I met my wife and made some of my best friendships at school.<p>When I think back I consider what I might rather have done instead: build a start-up company, or travel. But both of those would require money that I didn't have, so school (for which I could get loans) was the best choice for me at the time.<p>If you go:<p>Community college wasn't the cutting edge of academics, but it was cheap and helped me make the transition. (Read: I had trouble with motivation and getting to class on time, and those mistakes are easier to deal with at a cheap community college.) Get your GPA up and then you'll have your pick of good-quality state schools. High enough and you won't have to pay for them.<p>I don't regret choosing a state school after that. I'm happy I didn't rack up more student loan debt.<p>Don't overload yourself with credits. I regret doing so. Take a moderate load and do something interesting with your extra time. (Like your personal programming projects and experiments. Or do research as an undergrad.)<p>Don't major in computer science. I regret doing so. Major in something ""cool,"" a natural science like Physics or Astronomy, or something you can really sink your brain into like Mathematics or Philosophy, or something that's not easy to pick up as a spare time hobby like electrical engineering. Or any other ""real"" subject that interests you. Take interesting computer science classes as electives. Minor or double-major in it if you want. You can teach yourself the same amount from a book, and your future employers won't care what your major is in, if you can demonstrate that you know what you're doing. Plus, having some science under your belt can lead to an awesome career of discovery, instead of being a cubicle monkey re-writing back-end software for a greedy bank or telecom company. (Burnout all over again.)<p>If you're anything like me, and this is my number one regret about school: go to the fucking gym at least three times a week. Doesn't matter if you look great or not: It's free and it's good for your <i>brain</i>. I stopped going to the gym in school citing ""lack of time"" and slipped into an unmotivated depression that almost ruined my school, my marriage, my basically everything. Do whatever it takes to stay active. I wish I could go back in time with a baseball bat and knock some sense into myself.<p>After school, if you took out loans to go, you're a slave until you pay them off. If you do the above without failing, you'll get a decent job. I recommend making the minimum payments, live frugally until you build up a savings account.

I wanted the Fleming company to be aware they weren't sitting on some sort of OPEC-like monopoly -- which is the thinking that apparently drives the current Agency pricing model in publishing.<p>Pricing is the hot topic in publishing right now.  Notice how someone such as Konrath is raking in the dough with his $2.99 eBooks.<p>It doesn't matter what the publisher thinks the ""value"" is -- it's the price people are willing to pay that matters.  Does Konrath think his stuff is devalued because it's no longer in paper form at a higher price?  Or does he see the greater value in having a larger income?<p>Tell me, does being free devalue the software a lot of you use?  I don't think so.  But if they tried to price it, what would you be willing to pay?<p>You're all very smart people here (and I state that without any sarcasm), so I wonder if anyone here has devised any sort of pricing algorithm that could be applied to publishing?<p>I always hold up the Henry Ford model: he priced his cars cheap because he wanted them above all to be affordable and to sell.

The people who taught the class were awesome, but I can't help feeling that they were a bit apologetic for 1) knowing so much about the language, 2) having to teach us, and 3) not being able to change the language in any way.  But maybe that's hindsight and altered memories based on the dinner and drinks we shared after the week of classes.<p>The opacity of the language lead to a shared conclusion of those in the class (some of whom were taking it as a refresher), that all of the unique Sawzall code at Google had already been written in the first few months of it's use, and everyone else had just been copying and pasting snippets from everyone else's scripts.<p>I can understand why Google released it, it's the start to a halfway decent map-reduce implementation, having a low-overhead startup, quick runtime, etc. (compared to Python, which had been an initial logs processor, but which was punted for logs-processing mapreduces thanks to it's relatively high startup costs compared to processing time).  But with things like Hadoop (and it's support for arbitrary languages for operations), I can't help but feel like this is a little late to the open source game.<p>Also, back at Google, I had the start to a project to translate a subset of Python to Sawzall in order to allow for people to not have to suffer, and potentially to write better logs processing code.

I think with a little tweaking this could really take off.<p>Here's my thoughts<p>1) For the front page, its a little right in your user's face that you're taking a 50% cut of the money.  I would word that differently.  Not sure exactly how.  Maybe take out the bit about how much the ladies get paid and explain that in the signup process, or separate the ""how it works"" by gender on separate pages.  Its just a little too ""kimono wide open"" on the financials.  Also, ""Just click here within the next 7 days for a full refund."" should either be eliminated or reworded to say something to the effect of ""You can get a refund within 7 days of getting a response.""  While we're on that subject, are you going to award the money to the lady regardless of whether it was rejected?  If not, you should clearly state that.  I don't think you do.  You just say answer the question and get paid.  There's nothing talking about the approval process being tied to the money.<p>2) The bullet points below the top box on the front page repeat a lot of the information that is in the top box.  You don't need to repeat yourself.  Consider combining those two spaces into one.<p>3) While ""meet the ladies"" is a whimsical title for that page, it doesn't actually deliver (as people have already stated).  You're not actually introducing us, more telling us about demographics.  Maybe ""Who are the ladies?"" is more accurate and consistent with the message of the page (I noticed you have a link titled exactly that which points to the same place...)<p>4) You need something to convince us to trust you.  A demo of a question/answer?  Screen shots perhaps?  Testimonials would definitely go a long way.<p>5)  The menus could stand to be cleaned up.  Either you don't need the ""login/register"" links or you don't need the ""guys ask a question"" and ""ladies answer a question"" links.  I would lean towards getting rid of the latter.  That allows you to move buzz down to the footer (its not that important to have up at the top.  The average user doesn't care how much you've been talked about... sorry.  The ""guys ask a question"" link points to the login page.  I'm not sure why the ""ladies:..."" doesn't also point to a login/register page.  It should as well.  Also, fix the capitalization on the text of the login page. You Don't Need To Capitalize Every Word Of A Sentence.<p>6) On the buzz page, get rid of the buzz in Spanish.  The site is in English.  Don't expect anyone to take the time to pop it into Google Translate or for a majority of people to know Spanish.<p>Sorry this kinda jumps around alot and is probably a little too snarky.

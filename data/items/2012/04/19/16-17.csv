Some teachers move in a way to call attention to certain shapes or tactical sequences. Sometimes you just want to stick to beautiful moves. When you throw in handicap stones, komi, and reverse komi, how much you win or lose by is arbitrary. You can win by 0.5 points, but that's largely dependent on komi you agreed to. The losing player still has half of the board.<p>All fluid objectives during a game of chess between strong players are still subordinate to the ultimate objective: capture the king.

Can we be tricked by names! After using it for a while just yesterday, I found it not bad at all.<p>In a nutshell, Splunk is valuable because it turns your unstructured untyped data into something much easier to analyze and Business Intelligence (BI) ready. IMHO, the strength of Splunk is two folds. First, it provides a central place to view and mine your logs across hundreds or thousands of machines. This is very useful in many organizations with large scale distributed computing because you don't need to ssh into your database server in one terminal and compare the results in another terminal connecting to your web server, if you could ever figure out which of the 100 database servers you should look at. Second, instead of just greping, it treats each log entry as a list of key-value pairs and provides a simple yet powerful query language for it. On top of that, it gives you a library of visualization components. I was able to build a fully-customized Google Analytics style dashboard for my application in 20 minutes. And I would say that is empowerment, and empowerment is the most valuable value.<p>And if you are very into technologies, they are a Python house, which is always a plus :)",1334854721

That's a minor part in the larger picture: acquiring content illegally is a better experience than acquiring it legally.  \nLet's say I purchased season one on bluray, and just as I was coming home from the store my friend gave me a thumb drive with the torrented files on it. I wouldn't even open the shrink wrap. If the bluray disc gets scratched, I no longer have access to my content; I can back up the files on the thumb drive though. If I want to watch an episode, I have to sit through commercials on the bluray that I purchased; I can watch them immediately off the thumb drive though. If I want to project using a vga cable, I may run into content protection issues; the files on the thumb drive will work just fine though.<p>It's not a matter of cost or wait time.

Similarly, if you want to go from transport hub to transport hub (bus/rail station, airport etc.) that's no problem, but getting from the transport hub to your home ranges from expensive and awkward to impossible, depending on how far you live from the transport hub.<p>Self-driving cars solve this problem.

3863912,comment,3861916,3863047,1,0,eshvk,,,"Very true. I was bewildered by the hate for the 501 manifesto. I think of myself as a person who likes math so much that I will program to build fun stuff that lets me do more math. I have had days where I was so fully immersed into the problem that I have spent around 20 hours ""hacking"" (really reading papers, covering white boards with math and  prototyping out stuff). I have also had days where I was in implementation mode and I usually don't spend more than 8-9 hours doing that (unless I need to ship tomorrow or something). I am puzzled at the idea that somehow me finding something more fascinating (and definitely much more harder) than programming to do on my personal time is a bad thing. As long as I spend my day productively and get stuff done, why does it really matter?<p>As a side note, I have found that setting a hard cut off helps you to push away irrelevant chit chatting, youtube, emails and what not and focussing on the job in order to get it done. While obviously I have had ideas in the shower and that helps my next day become more productive, I don't see the need to immediately act on that and go open up my computer and write code.",1334854120

The more lenient a store is with its return policy, the happier its customers will be, and the more money they'll be inclined to spend there.<p>For example, managers often have the discretion to extend the duration of stated policies; in my experience, they're happy to do so if it'll please the customer.  This costs the stores some money, but the people in charge keep the policies in place, so they must have judged them a net win to their business.  I'm happy to take advantage of the convenience it offers me; in fact, I'm more likely to shop at a store with a lax return policy, and likely to buy more, as I know I can return it later if I don't like it.

I've seen the whole flex time system work best when everyone is an interchangeable factor cog and completely fail when people are useful knowledge workers.<p>My hypothetical example would be writing a search engine.  You have two brilliant knowledge workers.  Alice is a brilliant algorithm specialist who has a new way to sort lists in O(1) time.  Bob is a genius data center guy who can split anything across any number of servers.  The only problem is that Alice is a morning person who works best from 7am to 5PM, while Bob's brain doesn't even start until 4PM, though he'll still be wide awake at 2AM.<p>Alice understand the theory behind parallelization, but she doesn't have the experience to truly write great code on the massive scale you need.  Bob can find his way around a tree, but the fiddly details of O(1) search are beyond him.  Thus, you really need both of them working together to make any progress.  However, they're only together for an hour and Bob's always deadlocked by his inability to get answers from Alice while she sleeps.  Similarly, Alice can answer his e-mails in the morning, but anything she write before Bob arrives will have to be thrown out because it won't scale properly.<p>Now, if the office forces them to work from noon until nine, then you'll get nine hours of work out.  Granted, for four of those hours, Alice will be tired.  Bob will be tired for another four.  Still, if they can even work at a quarter capacity during those times, you're still getting three times as much done, while simultaneously giving both employee's back a full hour in each day.<p>How do you handle a situation like this?",1334852527

HBO GO is a great app, and its launch represented an intriguing challenge to the status quo of the analog and digital content ecosystems.<p>We should keep in mind, however, that HBO is owned by Time Warner -- a company with plenty of vested interests in the status quo, not to mention a number of other cable and broadcast channels (CNN, Cartoon Network, CW, etc.) whose existence as discrete networks would be (in its view) threatened by overly disruptive maneuvers by one of its subsidiaries.<p>Furthermore, HBO's bread is buttered by the big cable providers. It makes the majority of its revenue from licensing fees to the likes of Comcast, Time Warner Cable (<i>not</i> presently owned by Time Warner, fwiw), AT&T, and the others.<p>Ultimately, I get the impression that HBO -- were it an independent business entity -- would be acting more aggressively to move away from the status quo.

They took big chances even when it wasn't profitable to do so.<p>I've had a serious love affair with the network beginning with Dream On, The Larry Sanders Show, then moving on to Oz (yeah it was a 'male' soap opera I guess :), Sopranos, 6 Feet Under, Deadwood - which I didn't particularly _love_, but highly respected, and most of all The Wire (best thing to ever grace the screen IMO - they lost $$ on it throughout its run)... and then I killed my cable sub and haven't seen anything of their's since.<p>Now Mad Men and Breaking Bad are my two favorite shows, they're both on AMC, and I can easily purchase each season on iTunes HD for just north of $30.  Every episode is available hours after they originally air.  I'd pay twice that much.<p>Of course, the problem is HBO is just too tightly coupled to big cable.  They're one of the main attractions, and as such the kickbacks they get are tied to contracts that prevent them from wresting their content to any great degree.  Until this model changes, their A content won't see the light of day, and more draconian measures are likely to be put in place to thwart piracy.  It's not HBO itself per-see, but HBO as a proxy for big cable; as a defense mechanism to prop up a flailing business model.",1334851267

If you work 100+ hours per week, you might miss out on seeing your kids grow up (or having any in the first place). Working ~50 hours instead might make your business grow more slowly but might allow you to enjoy other (more important, for some) aspects of life.<p>As a side note: some of the investors I've talked to also encourage and prefer a more sustainable lifestyle in a startup.

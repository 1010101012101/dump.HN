But that does not mean that it is not theoretically possible (if very, very, very unlikely).<p>A lot of the brain uploading people seem to look at this through destructive brain scanning (correct me if I'm wrong). That sounds like a terrible idea - why does it have to be all in one go and not reversible.<p>What if - for example (I'm spitballing) - you move into the brain slowly replacing each live neuron with an artificial neuron (far fetched I know - nanotech is ridiculously hard/difficult), instead of going slice by slice on a frozen brain.<p>There is no reason that this slow ""viral"" method couldn't be done (or reversed - replace artificial neuron with neuron). This is akin to how we deploy distributed systems - create a compiled slug and push it out node by node via bittorrent. The change is tested on each node, and slowly moves out. If anything goes wrong - just roll back to previous slug.<p>Once you have full conversion - upload away (as I presume getting states of artificial neurons is relatively easy vs. organic cells). Have no doubts about it - this is a super hard problem. But it is not impossible.",1342400323

Visa typically receives a separate flat fee per transaction. Although often payment processors will charge the merchant a flat percentage fee which includes the interchange fees, acquiring bank fees, association fees, and the payment processors fees.<p>Visa Europe (a separate company from Visa USA) would likely have to assume liability for chargebacks in the event that the  acquiring bank went out of business without transferring it's Visa business to another bank. I'm not sure if such a situation has ever happened though. In general the liability goes: Merchant -> Payment Processor -> Acquiring Bank -> Visa.",1342400303

Really? Your email is more important than understanding your body? Its more important than taking time for you? Its more important than everyone else here?<p>Oh, and by the way, she was in the middle of the front row.<p>She stepped out and rejoined class a few minutes later. Apparently, she had gone to complain to management.<p>Previously, I had been asked by management to just let the students do whatever they wanted.<p>Come in late, leave early, answer emails, come in during class to get weights, take photos for the newsletterwhatever came up, I was told to just say yes.<p>So, on this day, I didnt actually say anything to this student.

4248808,comment,4248245,4248693,1,0,JamesLeonis,,,"I agree with all your points, especially 3 and 5. I think privacy can be maintained to a general degree while still giving fairly good pinpoint demographics to the ad agencies. A major problem is that most companies don't know what to do with themselves with this kind of granular view of their targets, so they go with the mass produced spray-and-pray model used for other broadcast mediums. Google, I believe, has the right idea with targeted adwords that are relevant to what the user is looking at or what they search for.<p>One problem I have with the ad supported model is many services don't give the user the ability to pay and do away with advertising. There are many services that DO charge the user, and you notice that they don't rely on ad revenue to support themselves. However there is very little in between the two models. Reddit has a bit of this with it's ads for free users and no ads for ""Reddit Gold"", or their paying accounts. I can't think of another service, off the top of my head, that does this. I believe this could be a huge boon to many publishing and news services.",1342400164

4248796,comment,4248780,4248780,1,0,karl_gluck,,,"Hi everyone!  I've read HN for a while and am often inspired by the projects I see here, but this is my first time to submit something and get feedback, so it's pretty exciting. :)  My fiancee and I were inspired to create a secure password service after seeing the Vault (by James Coglan; <a href=""https://getvau.lt/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://getvau.lt/</a>) posted here a couple weeks back.  We stayed up all night putting together Cryptasia and, now, finally think it's ready.<p>First:  What is Cryptasia?   It's a service that takes a website's name, your secret phrase, applies some hashing, and generates a unique password for that website.  By using Cryptasia, you can log in to any website requiring a username/password using just one single secret phrase.  Your password on every website will be unique and cryptographically unrelated to your secret phrase, so if one website is compromised--which seems to be happening a lot recently--you won't have to change your password on any other website.<p>Now we know what you might be thinking... great, what's the big deal about yet another password generator?  Why is it any better for keeping track of all your passwords than, say, KeePass, 1password, lastpass, or even Vault?<p>1  You'll never have to invent a password for any website.  Cryptasia knows which characters can and can't be used, which characters are required, and how long the password needs to be.  Using this, it automatically generates a password that meets the requirements.  We have a lot of services programmed in already, but with an account, adding new websites or changing a website's settings just takes modifying a line in a Google spreadsheet.<p>2  The website's name isn't actually used to create your password.  Instead, Cryptasia uses an associated key string.  By sharing key strings among the password settings for different websites such as youtube.com and gmail.com, you can log in to different sites that share an authentication service (in this case, Google's) but have different names.  The other benefit is that Cryptasia lets you change passwords for a website without changing your secret phrase.<p>3  Copying your password and logging in to another website is really streamlined.  We autocomplete the website name (including shortcuts, like ""aws"" for Amazon Web Services), and the ""copy+go"" button both copies the password to your clipboard and jumps you to the login page for whatever website you selected.  Try out Hacker News!<p>4  We don't store any personal information.  We don't even have a database!  You don't need to trust us in order to use Cryptasia--the source code is unminified and in plain sight.<p>5  Cryptasia shows an image based on your secret phrase, so you know you typed it correctly<p>6  It works great on mobile!  It was a huge pain, but we got copy+paste working for Safari, the Android default browser, Firefox mobile and Chrome mobile.<p>7  An account with us doesn't require you to remember yet another password.  That would be ironic.  Your account is based on data in a Google Spreadsheet, so the privacy settings of that spreadsheet will apply to your version of Cryptasia.  For example, my personal Cryptasia account is ""crypt.asia/karlgluck"".  I've left mine public so anyone can see it and, theoretically, use it to generate passwords--however, I can modify the spreadsheet at any time, so that probably wouldn't be a good idea.  Still, if I didn't want people to know at which websites I had accounts, I could make the spreadsheet private and it would be nonfunctional unless I was logged in to my Google account.<p>Speaking of, a Cryptasia account is free for the first month, but we have to set them up manually so it might take a little while for us to get yours going.<p>Let us know what you think!<p>Get started here:  <a href=""http://crypt.asia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crypt.asia</a>",1342399888

Theyre on the market more than the great people, but less than the incompetent, and all in all they will show up in small numbers in your 1000 resume pile, but for the most part, almost every hiring manager in Palo Alto right now with 1000 resumes on their desk has the same exact set of 970 resumes from the same minority of 970 incompetent people that are applying for every job in Palo Alto, and probably will be for life, and only 30 resumes even worth considering, of which maybe, rarely, one is a great programmer. OK, maybe not even one.""<p>Did you see what Joel did there?   He's basically admitted that rockstar programmers are present in the population that he's interested in hiring at a rate of less than 30 to 1.   So don't focus on the rockstars; it was probably a mistake for you to mention it in your blog post, because the reality is, you (or anybody else) has no idea whether you have what it takes to be a ""rockstar programmer"".  Just settle on being a solid, competent developer, and then build on it from there.<p>The reality is that to achieve true greatness in almost any profession, you need to be lucky (either in the genes you received in the case of atheletics) or getting the right opportunity, but you also have to work really, REALLY, hard.  People don't necessarily talk enough about how the Beatles were perfectionists, and how hard they worked on their craft and on their recordings; instead it's a lot more fun to talk about being a rock star, and all of the bene's that come from being a rock star.<p>So I'll repeat what I said --- work hard.  Make a name for yourself (and not as a whiner).  Contribute to the community.  Be passionate about you chose to work on, so that you think it's wonderful to spend 60+ hours of your free time working on it.   If you're not passionate about your day job, then start looking ASAP to find a new working situation for which you can be passionate.<p>Then be patient, and watchful for your specific opportunity to come by.

Want a hotel room overlooking Times Square for NYE? Sure, maybe it'll cost you $25K, but you can probably get it (I'm just guessing here). Want Madonna to come sing at your barbecue? Sure, that'll be a million bucks (plus incidentals).<p>So when a rich guy is without friends, his first reaction is ""how much will it cost?"". The moment he flashes his money, all sorts of ""friends"" come out of the woodwork, happy to be his chum. So, in the short term it looks like it's working. But these aren't friendships; these are hired companions. Just because you can hire a hooker to have sex with you doesn't make her your girlfriend.<p>One only has to look at the myriad NBA/NFL players out there who, despite having earned 100s of millions of dollars over their lifetimes, end up broke shortly after retiring (and this does not include child support).

It's really nowhere near as important where you start as that you keep getting better. I've started teams using a 2-tier H/M/L process for assigning points and it works fine.

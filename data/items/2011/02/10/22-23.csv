I think the 80 character limitation is increasingly rarer to actually encounter these days. Even people developing via a shell will almost certainly have much more than 80 characters of width to play with.<p>We've finally accepted that web developers can expect visitors to have a higher resolution than VGA, and those are potentially non-tech-savvy users. Can't we expect developers to have more than 80 character width editors? Plus, I think splitting lines is pretty ugly.",1297378792
2204237,comment,2200705,2202281,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Fair point. I understand. However, some people today are actually accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment. Not everywhere. Amazon doesn't accept it. Your local water utility doesn't take it. But somebody takes it. And then there are ways of converting Bitcoins back into say US dollars. And then you can pay Amazon and your water utility in dollars. And so on. It is happening already.<p>In prisons, cigarettes are often used as a form of accepted currency. Weird but, as you said, cigarettes have functional value before and beyond their arbitrary assigned role as currency. Now take these little pieces of green-ish papers in my wallet, with the funny markings on it. I heard a rumor that others will take it as a unit of payment, even though in reality, it's just a little piece of paper with some markings on it. It's actual functional value could maybe be that of a piece of tissue paper to wipe my ass. Except it's not very good at it. So I wouldn't even use it for that. The US government says, ""Forsooth and yeah verily, these pieces of paper shall be the currency we use!"" and couple that with a promise to accept it themselves as a unit of payment, and therefore, poof, it now has value.<p>Last point, if you parachute onto a tiny uncharted Pacific island and contact a lost tribe there, and offer them $20 USD for their food, they will most likely say, ""Sorry, we only take melons and womenfolk as currency. We don't take US dollars, and we don't take American Express."" Lesson: what is accepted as currency varies by individual and culture and time period. It's totally arbitrary.",1297378791

But passing the Turing Test doesn't answer this question. It answers a different question: What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game? Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?<p>Its up to you if you take an affirmative answer to those questions to also answer the question it replaces: ""Can machines think?"" The imitation game does not aim to proof anything to this point. It aims to support its replacement questions, which we have to take at face value: that imitation is just as good (for all sense and purposes) as the real thing.<p>Also, you write:\n>And how will we know that Watson actually feels fear? The answer to this type of conundrum is simple and well-known: a Turing test.<p>If I make a chatscript that tricks you into thinking it was a person feeling fear, by your own logic, you would deem that chatscript to be thinking and actually capable of intelligent conversation, even if you were told afterward it was just some lines of code, feigning you with a (if input, output: yes), it still passed the test, so your answer is: those binary bits must feel fear (or you agree that you apply the Turing Test where it makes no sense).<p>What entities are really feeling and how to communicate this, has no simple known answer. There have been century-old debates about Qualia. The answer certainly isn't an imitation game, if you insist it is, you are equating feigning with truly possessing.

Plus more of the jobs that are needed can be done off-shore, or, on-shore but with less office space and commuting, which in turn drives down money that needs to be spent on those sectors as well. Also the increasing popularity of so-called Agile and MVP philosophies is also driving down the cost of testing business ideas and getting to market. And yes, there's an increasing amount of actionable information, quality entertainment and useful functionality available for free on the Internet. So less money (needing to be) spent in those areas, thus less money available for jobs in those areas, for any given unit of product provided. Plus, due to the Internet, an increasing proportion of the revenue that comes into businesses (overall, but most proportionately in the software industries) can be captured by the owners/capitalists/entrepreneurs, rather than labor.<p>I'm not sure if this is a net win or net lose, overall, for the world. But it's certainly a net win for certain subsets of the population, and a net lose for other subsets.

Which means that it's only a matter of discovering the right algorithms to run.<p>Whether we're making progress on that is debatable, but don't mistake the slow progress at cracking ""the"" AI algorithm with the speed at which the intelligence explosion will take off after that - it took many long, slow years to figure out how to build a nuclear weapon, but once we figured out the trick and started a nuclear reaction, the thing blew up in a fraction of a second.

It can land, be the base for excursions for more than three days, becomes and impromptu rocket launch pad and is eminently dockable. All that capability fits in a cube with a five meter edge and weighs less than 15 tons, it was developed and built in well less than ten years and it worked every single time.<p>Some like the raw power of the Saturn V, I think the multi-talented Lunar Module is much more amazing.",1297375252

What if Mubarak really is just another kleptocratic authoritarian now showing possible signs of mental instability with his ""I'll leave/I'm staying"" schtick? Is it the media's job to make <i>that</i> seem sympathetic?<p>In fact, I'll go further with this: One of the big things I hate about (American) mainstream media is that it tries <i>too hard</i> to give ""both sides"" of a one-sided issue. A case in point is the whole thing about whether vaccines cause autism: Informed people knew from pretty much day one that they don't, and that the whole supposed 'debate' was completely manufactured by a combination of cynical lawsuit-mongers and abysmally ignorant celebrities. Yet you'd have never known that from how respectfully those trolls were treated and how seriously the 'debates' were handled in the mainstream media.<p>That's actually a somewhat common critique of the media; I'm bringing it up now because what you said happened to clang on it to some extent. I'm not trying to attack you with it.",1297375225

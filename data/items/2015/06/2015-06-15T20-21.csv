If you write an article for a magazine, they pay you for it. Once they do, and you&#x27;ve granted them a partial copyright (in this case most likely second serial rights) then every time they pull an article to include in their &quot;news&quot; they should pay the author.<p>The much better way to do this would be, &quot;We&#x27;d like to include your RSS feed in our News application, if anyone reads an article that you have provided to us we will make a one time payment to you of $X (say $250), in exchange for that payment you give us the right, in perpetuity, to continue to provide access to that article though our News application.&quot;<p>Basically if you&#x27;re writing is bringing people to the News application they should pay for that. And once they have, they can monetize there end of it just like newspapers and magazines by putting ads on the site or adding other junk.<p>It sounds like they are trying to construct some novel theory[1] where if someone managed to find your blog and read it they wouldn&#x27;t have paid for it, so Apple doesn&#x27;t need to pay for it if they are using it to attract people to their app.<p>So lets look at it from an information economics perspective, the author&#x27;s article derives its value from the author&#x27;s artistic expression. Nobody else is going to write it just like they did, or how they did. The author &quot;spends&quot; that value to attract readers to the blog, and readers &quot;pay&quot; for that value by by exposed to advertisers who have paid the author to be on their page. So you get that?<p>The reader &quot;buys&quot; their content by agreeing to be exposed to advertising.<p>The author &quot;sells&quot; their content by providing access to their readers to advertisers.<p>The advertiser &quot;buys&quot; access to the content by paying the author when a reader interacts with the ad.<p>Apple is trying to step in, get the content for free, bring readers to their News App and then sell access to their readers to the Advertisers. You can see that without the Author&#x27;s content there is no &quot;value&quot; to readers in the news app. Authors who agree to this are simply dropping money into Apple&#x27;s lap.<p>[1] It isn&#x27;t really novel people try to rip off artists by offering them &#x27;exposure&#x27; all the time.",1434401940

There is no objective value in blocking ads, it depends on the party. Since there is no objective valuation, it is not bad manners; it is merely an ability of consumers that is undesirable to advertisers and the ad hosting companies.<p>> It&#x27;s the same as taking the free newspapers in your area, cutting out all the advertisements, and giving those out to people.<p>Nice try at an analogy, but removing the ads from free newspapers and giving the results to people could be seen as conspiracy harming the newspaper, because there would be party doing the removing and taking over the distribution. With online ads, nothing of this sort happens, because the consumer requests the newspaper company - not some other ad-removing party - for the newspaper article, the newspaper company sends it to him with hope he will pay attention to ads and the consumer displays only that part of the sent document which he deems worthy of his attention. He does this with help of his computer in which he is entitled to process and filter information in any way he deems useful. No organized action destroying the business is happening, the consumer himself removes the part he does not want on his computer, he does not remove ads for other people. This is virtually the same as when the person buys a newspaper in store and skips reading the ads, which everybody who would read the newspaper is entitled to do. All people are entitled to filter the information other people, companies and government try to feed them, irrespective of the channel, be it paper, audiovisual channels or the Internet.

9721986,comment,9717786,9719569,0,0,cactusface,,,"I&#x27;d be very interested to see a compiler where you can force inlining.  How does it handle cycles in the call graph?  How does it handle code bloat because the inline keyword was used too often?<p>In GCC at least, you can only give suggestions.  The following options control the inliner:<p>--<p>max-inline-insns-single:
    Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc. This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in gcc&#x27;s internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner will consider for inlining. This only affects functions declared inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C++). The default value is 300.<p>max-inline-insns-auto:
    When you use -finline-functions (included in -O3), a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining by the compiler will be investigated. To those functions, a different (more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can be applied. The default value is 300.<p>max-inline-insns:
    The tree inliner does decrease the allowable size for single functions to be inlined after we already inlined the number of instructions given here by repeated inlining. This number should be a factor of two or more larger than the single function limit. Higher numbers result in better runtime performance, but incur higher compile-time resource (CPU time, memory) requirements and result in larger binaries. Very high values are not advisable, as too large binaries may adversely affect runtime performance. The default value is 600.<p>max-inline-slope:
    After exceeding the maximum number of inlined instructions by repeated inlining, a linear function is used to decrease the allowable size for single functions. The slope of that function is the negative reciprocal of the number specified here. The default value is 32.<p>min-inline-insns:
    The repeated inlining is throttled more and more by the linear function after exceeding the limit. To avoid too much throttling, a minimum for this function is specified here to allow repeated inlining for very small functions even when a lot of repeated inlining already has been done. The default value is 130.<p>max-inline-insns-rtl:
    For languages that use the RTL inliner (this happens at a later stage than tree inlining), you can set the maximum allowable size (counted in RTL instructions) for the RTL inliner with this parameter. The default value is 600.<p>--<p>So, while the inliner is great, if performance really matters for a hot loop, and you definitely want that code to be inlined, you might end up having to do it by hand.  Because otherwise, if you change something somewhere else in your program, the inliner might suddenly decide not to inline your function anymore.  You could say the same thing about virtual functions: devirtualization is great but it&#x27;s not guaranteed.  Or loop unrolling.  Or codegen.  Or whatever.",1434401329

Turtl is not a password manager per-se, and is still fairly early in development, but is a client-side encrypted note-taking tool. It could conceivably be used as a primary password manager service.<p>Some features that are useful: client-side crypto (key is derived from username/password, ALL data is encrypted by default), sharing between accounts via asym encryption, open source client & server means it could be run completely in-house if required (as opposed to using the hosted service).<p>It doesn&#x27;t have mobile apps right now, but those are coming pretty quick (either end of June or in July).<p>One of our slated features is a password note type, and possibly eventual integration with browsers.<p>Might be worth a look. Like I said, Turtl is new and is missing a lot of features you&#x27;d want in a pure-password-manager solution, but it has the potential to grow into this space a lot due to its security, sharing, and hosting features.",1434400212

The CSPC test has FALSELY COMMODITIZED bicycle helmets where all helmets are SEEN as having the same level of safety regardless of the truth.  Which then makes it very tough to sell people on extra safety, because all helmets are supposed to be AT LEAST SAFE ENOUGH thanks to the test.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to get the last word here, I&#x27;m trying to actually convince you of something.  I know I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but I can&#x27;t tell what.  To me it&#x27;s incredibly obvious that this particular standard is causing undesirable outcomes in society.  I&#x27;m doing my damnedest to try and convince you of that.  I&#x27;m having no success whatsoever.  Intuitively it must be my fault; only I can tell if you&#x27;re getting the gist of what I&#x27;m trying to communicate.  It would be folly for me to blame you for not understanding my bad explanation.<p>1.  Helmets only help you when they crush or break or deform.  If they don&#x27;t do this, they haven&#x27;t really protected you.<p>2.  Helmets are very strong, this is so that they can survive a very bad, high energy accident.  This is required as per CSPC.<p>3.  EPS doesn&#x27;t start to crush until you&#x27;ve exceeded its compressive strength.  In helmets, this is dictated by the maximal impact that it has to withstand.<p>4.  Lower than maximal impacts will cause very little of the helmet to get used, or perhaps none at all.  That means that the helmet did little or nothing to keep the person safe.<p>5.  Crash severity is probably distributed as 1/x or as Poission meaning that low energy events are far, far more frequent than high energy events.  Probably by several orders of magnitude.<p>7.  The false commoditization of helmets (due to the CSPC test) makes it very difficult to convince people that there is anything else even worth looking at for safety (since everything is definitely safe enough), and even if you can do so you still have to design your standard to be in excess of the CSPC standard.<p>8.  This leads a great many people to suffer concussions where a better designed helmet might have prevented them, while still providing an excellent level of safety for truly severe events.  It is entirely possible to make a helmet which wouldn&#x27;t pass the CSPC test that can provide good protection against concussion and death at the same time.",1434399437

We only had about 200 users, but somehow Apache would run out of workers because they were all busy serving some kind of request.  Turns out our Apache configuration was wrong specifically in the case of serving the favicon.  If you requested the favicon, it would get in a redirect loop, increasing the length of the url a little more each time until it hit the maximum url length and gave up.  A new job like this would get kicked off every time any user visited a page, and it&#x27;d take several minutes before it finally gave up.  So every user was unwittingly opening tons of long-running requests, with no indication that they were doing anything.",1434398622

You don&#x27;t even really need to set up much on the server side; if you fire the events at GA it will understand them. I think the real problem is expectations: Google is just doing statistics on big numbers, and for statistics to tell you anything, you have to have enough observations.<p>The real problem is that you need a critical mass of customers -- millions of uniques per month -- before this type of workflow tells you anything meaningful. And even then, diminishing returns set in pretty quickly: 80% of your legitimate users probably fit into 3 or 4 usage profiles that will stand out, so to identify the &#x27;long tail&#x27; traits and market to them individually requires exponentially more users.<p>Basically, the type of deep analytics and tracking Google and others promote are only available to customers with enough data to tease them out. This generally is enough to exclude small businesses. You can get some basic stats about your users, but probably nothing you didn&#x27;t know already.

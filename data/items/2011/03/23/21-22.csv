They agree, and you borrow a billion dollars, build the road, and start collecting tolls.  It doesn't cost the tax payer anything, and the people who use it do so voluntarily.<p>A few years later a politician decides it will be politically popular to build a free road right next to your road, but will simply pay for it with tax dollars.<p>This is not exactly fair to you right?  The politician has the power to take the money from constituants by threat of force (you go to jail for not paying taxes).  You don't have this power.<p>In foresight of this situation, you get the state to sign an agreement that they will not compete with your highway with taxpayer dollars.

2361635,comment,2360492,2361185,0,0,saranagati,,,"i think what's wrong with her theory (and any theory involving it being harder for women in the tech industry) is that there isn't any sort of favoritism towards men.  Software developers [especially] are very hyper critical and will often make snide remarks about someone while trying to help them in order to entertain themselves so that they don't get distracted while trying to help/communicate with someone.  The ""recipient"" being a woman (therefor largely in the minority) is the low hanging fruit for snide comments.  If the women were men, they would also receive a snide comment.<p>The other problem is that in relation to how many developers actually exist, there are very very few that garner any respect just for being who they are.  With the ratio's the way they are that means there are virtually no women in these spots.  That could make it appear that us male developers only give any respect to other men which isn't the case (well it's at least not a true cause/effect).<p>Anyways I've seen quite a few of these articles/blurbs but have never seen any actual examples of real sexism.

Although these stories are rarer (and riddled with narcissistic entreporn fodder for INC magazine and its ilk), they do offer some hope.<p>This article mentions that Pittsburgh has also seen significant decreases in population over this decade. Pittsburgh is often used as the model city for rust belt rebirth. They were the big player in steel, lost the steel industry, and were able to rebrand themselves. They are considered by most to be the most tech-friendly city in the rust belt. I'm sure a lot of that has to do with the fact that Pittsburgh did a better job in attracting businesses outside of steel when they still had the luxury of steel.<p>Having Carnegie Mellon doesn't hurt either. Most cities in the Rust Belt cannot worry about attracting talent because they are hemorrhaging talent. Instead these cities have to focus their attention and resources on retention.

Sometimes only the linguistic abstraction can give the solution (e.g., ""this problem is easy because the quadratic coefficient cancels out, and the equation is in the form t^3 + c t = d"").<p>It's also worth noting that manipulating the linguistic abstractions takes a lot of insight and talent (e.g., knowing the perfect substitution of variable to make an integral fall into a known form, or knowing which one of the four error terms will be hard to control, and working on it first).<p>It's not wise to be over-committed to the visual approach.",1300914626

2361464,comment,2360756,2360756,0,0,nnmy,,,"So, Shrewsbury, MA is on the list and their municipal cable has been around forever.  Since I have experience with them, I can tell you that a town owned cable company isn't some sort of panacea.  A town owned cable company is like a credit union.  It's really cool that they're kinda ""on your side"".  With Comcast and RCN (the other two cable companies I have experience with), I have to be remain on my toes lest they increase my rates. Likewise, they can be mean in that ""ha, we're a big company and you don't have any other options"" way (even though I'm living in one of the few places that <i>does</i> have two cable companies - RCN and Comcast).<p>However, it can also be annoying.  I remember Shrewsbury's cable company being a bit behind the other cable companies in the area in getting us broadband service.  It wasn't terribly behind, but when we were on dial-up, it was terribly annoying to see the neighboring towns with their commercial cable companies getting broadband before we did (no matter how small the gap was, when you're on dial up things seem like an eternity ;-)).  Their prices are what I would consider ""fair"".  $40 for 10Mbps doesn't seem like gouging, but it isn't exactly cheap. I'm currently paying $20 for 15Mbps - but I know that they'll continually try to up me to $65 and hope I don't complain.  Shrewsbury also puts caps on how much you can download.  The 10Mbps plan includes 250GB of transfer which is the same limit that Comcast and AT&T use.  It's hard for a small provider to handle a couple people that use an outrageous amount and the limit feels like the practical things that a credit union does to make sure that it can serve all its members.  They also up your transfer limit as you buy more speed - $50 gets you 15Mbps and 400GB of transfer.  And 400GB is a lot of transfer considering that it's about the maximum one can transfer in a month over a fully saturated T1 connection used every second of every day.  Heck, they even sell equipment at good rates - an 802.11N router at $40 is a fair price.<p>Their cable rates are similarly ""fair"" in that they're the honest and genuine prices that they think they can do business at and they're aren't looking to hook you on low teaser rates.<p>The service is pleasant and it's nice to know that you're getting the rate and not getting screwed by not knowing about some hidden deal.  However, they don't really beat the speed or pricing of commercial offerings.  They currently top out at 50Mbps for just shy of $100/mo while still capping upload at 2Mbps.  Comcast is offering that service in my area for a little over $100/mo with 10Mbps upload.  RCN is offering 60Mbps at that price range with uploads capped at 6Mbps.<p>There isn't some huge panacea by going with a town-owned system.  It's still really cool in the way that credit unions are really cool and, like credit unions, they can sometimes have a real local (and sometimes small) feel to them.  That's good and bad.  On the one hand, you're usually treated well.  These people are your neighbors and if you treat people poorly, it just isn't good for you.  It also means that sometimes you don't get the latest cable channels or things aren't as flashy with online portals where you can monitor usage and such.<p>I hate the idea that companies are trying to prevent these types of projects.  However, it's also annoying when people who haven't used one of these municipal systems think that these projects mean 100Mbps connections to the home for $20/mo.  Think of them like credit unions: they're on your side, they're trying to be nice to you, but they don't change everything.  Companies don't (usually) have profit margins of 200%.  Some of the lack of profit margin gets eaten by a lack of scale (Comcast has a lot more scale than a municipal project).  But it's very relaxing to be a customer of a company that you feel has a fair pricing system - rather than constantly being at odds with a company you feel is trying to screw you.",1300914392

Rather, it is simply demonstrating a particular example of just such an unusual occasion.<p>I'm not sure why everyone is reading into it so much: it's just a ""feel good"" piece, really, illustrating how one student's practical skill set -- here, coding -- was sufficiently talented to warrant a second look by one of the country's (best) universities. And, being a private school, they were willing (and able) to peel back their own red tape and allow admission notwithstanding his otherwise disqualifying credentials.<p>The point of the story is simply: here's a kid who was unqualified in the traditional, technical sense. But due to his obvious skill and intelligence in a particular field, a private school was willing to look past his technical disqualifications and, by its own prerogative, make an exception to its own rules.<p>This is most certainly why Berkeley and other public schools were unwilling to make an exception: they have less flexibility. (As someone who attended UCLA, I can attest personally to the stringent red tape of California's public university system.) That the blog throws public and private schools into the discussion demonstrates a remarkably cavalier oversight that misses the point entirely with respect to why, precisely, MIT -- a private school -- is the school that happened to grant the student the exception.",1300914273

2361450,comment,2360126,2360697,0,0,cicero,,,"I'm thinking Philosophy is not rigorous at all at some schools, and is just a lot of lofty opining. I have no proof or first-hand knowledge of this, but I get this from some people's description of their experiences of Philosophy classes. That may be why some people think it is intellectually inferior to technical subjects. My first degree is in Computer Science (Texas A&M University), and then I studied Philosophy (University of Dallas) many years later. I found the Philosophy we studied (original texts of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Heidegger) to be more difficult than Computer Science for a couple of reasons.<p>The first reason is that these were first-class leading-edge thinkers we were trying to understand. Aristotle is very densely packed with content, and we had to read and re-read passages to penetrate them. (Some think that the writings we have of Aristotle are actually class notes, and may not be a good representation of his lecture style.) The second reason is that even though Computer Science is an abstract subject, code is more concrete and graspable than a philosophical idea because you can compile and execute the code and see if and how it works. Philosophical ideas are either difficult to test (e.g. ethics) or practically impossible to test (metaphysics).",1300914236

30625,comment,30581,30581,0,0,Keios,,,"IMO, YCombinator should fund startups in India. Contrary to popular belief there is significant entrepreneurial and IT activity happening here. I would not take anyone seriously who generalizes a whole nation, especially one as diverse as India, in one fell swoop. I am not saying the startup levels are anywhere on the scale of Silicon Valley, I am saying that there is sufficient talent of all types available in India.\nUnfortunately, these questions come up for the wrong reasons such as Visa problems. If YCombinator helped with Visas, then I don't think this question or other similar ones would pop up.<p>In terms of finances, the dollar goes a long mile in India and that is  a plus. Perhaps a YC startup will probably run out of India in the future, especially because web startups are allowed 100% foreign ownership and foreign direct investment in India.<p>I thought it might be interesting to start a google group for all Indians who read Ycombinator and similar stuff and maybe want do a startup - <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/TechStartups-India"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/TechStartups-India</a>\n Join in, lets find out how many Indians are around and lets chat/meet up :)",1182806322

30620,comment,30477,30486,0,0,willarson,,,"This isn't really a hacker/non-hacker issue, its just an issue of having vision, and having good people with good ideas. A company that relies solely on its founder for innovation is not a healthy company.<p>\nI don't have much love for third party widgets. Their inclusion on Facebook has cluttered up the service. For people who are using websites as tools to accomplish tasks, I don't see 3rd party widgets as a compelling feature. Like Facebook, LinkedIn is also a social network, but it differs as it is fundamentally a tool rather than a toy.<p>\nSo far widgets have been toys, some of them excellent toys, but toys none the less. Its a hell of a genie's bottle to open up in exchange for apps like TopFriends, iLike, and the option to draw a mustache on your friend's profile picture. I realize that the creation of tool-widgets is possible, but I am still waiting to see if the effort of developing a public API is worth the return in tool functionality (LinkedIn will probably survive without the inclusion of TopConnections, and ConnectionsIdTotallySleepWith apps ;).<p>\nTo address a few other points, Friendster failed to get on the boat because it had immense technical problems leading to its stability/usability plummeting like Wall Street trader jumping out of a window on black Friday. They probably would have also missed the boat on developing an API, but this is what happens at poorly lead companies: they fail catastrophically. My last thought is that after a company becomes sufficiently large, having a hacker leader who wants to build the public API by himself may be less of an asset than a disaster. Facebook released their API quickly, and they released it incomplete and with shoddy support and documentation. They've happened to get a blankcheck for good publicity... but others may not be so fortunate.",1182805700

(He coined the phrase ""disruptive technology,"" and has done a lot of solid research on patterns of disruption.)  Highly recommended for entrepreneurs.",1182805312

While it seems less substantial than some other points about starting a business, like how to get to the champagne moments in the first place, it is important.  It's important for what you remember and make the experience about when you're starting your business.<p><a href=""http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/2004/10/moons_over_my_h.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/2004/10/moons_over_my_h.html</a>",1182805207

It makes surveillance all too easy.<p>This is where I think smart people could make a difference. When I want to share data with someone in the same location as me we should really be talking P2P only. It wouldn&#x27;t allow NSA & co to get the same full picture as easy as they can now with central data hubs and only a few communication channels.",1379015996

6376546,comment,6373185,6376300,4,0,teddyh,,,"> You are saying that conferences should not be like parties, because conferences are not like parties<p>Not quite.<p>What I am saying is that conferences and parties have different goals.  The goal of a conference is to advance the field.  The goal of a party is to have fun.  The goal of a conference is not advanced by organizing a party, nor is the goal of a party advanced by organizing a conference.<p>A conference <i>can</i> (and perhaps <i>should</i>) have many elements of a party in it  evening social activities, perhaps even in a bar where alcolhol (gasp!) is consumed.  All of this may be perfectly fine.  But, these activities should be organized with <i>the goal of the conference</i> in mind.<p>However, what many conference organizers seem to do is fill the days with talks, (while minimizing the time between talks to fit as many as possible), and then on the evenings they try to organize the best <i>party</i> they can think of.  The best <i>party</i>, mind you, not the best <i>socializing activity</i>, which might have advanced the networking in the field, but the best <i>party</i>, whatever the tastes of the organizers and/or the prospective attendees.<p>This makes the conference a series of undiscussed talks in the daytime, followed by a series of usually pounding party keggers at night.  The talks can be watched at home if they are filmed, and the parties can be had locally, too.  There is no reason to attend these kinds of conferences.  Unless, of course, you are <i>already</i> connected and go to any number of conferences a year and meet all the same people  your party buddies.",1379015991

6376542,comment,6372466,6373670,3,0,Gormo,,,"> Is it really that unreasonable for an OS manufacturer to restrict the devices on which it can be installed?<p>Yes, it is.  If I pay for a product, it&#x27;s my prerogative to use it in any way I please.  Copyright grants a monopoly on distribution, not on controlling post-purchase usage of the product.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to say &quot;we only officially support installation of this product on this list of devices, and can&#x27;t guarantee it will work on other devices&quot;, but inserting artificial restrictions into the product that prevent people from even <i>trying</i> to do officially unsupported things with the product, at their own initiative and at their own risk, is something there really isn&#x27;t any justification for.<p>> do I really want the pain of people using it on an Arduino?<p>What pain?  How does it even concern you if people are installing your firmware onto an Arduino, provided that they have legitimate copies of it?<p>> Opening it up to all the devices dilutes the main thing it has going for it.<p>Obviously, <i>not</i> installing OSX on other devices is what dilutes the &quot;main thing it has going for it&quot; for those people who have chosen to install OSX on other devices.  Are you seriously trying to tell people that their personal preferences are objectively wrong?<p>> Sometimes there is freedom in restriction.<p>Straight out of Orwell.",1379015924

Her understanding of maths due to her degree sets her apart from the normal teachers with a educational math degree, or any other degree which was not math orientated. You can see in her yearly results she is a good math teacher. I understand this does not hold true for all people. But something that you missed in the infographic is that teachers is held in high regard, something that is lacking in my country of origin and I believe a lot of other countries.<p>I am not clear how taking graduate courses in Mathematics which can range anything from Measure Theory, Abstract algebra to Grad. Real Analysis helps you become a better teacher to high schoolers whose interaction with mathematics  should ideally have enough coverage from the basic level.<p>The respect thing is not clear to me. Lawyers and Investment bankers are not respected here in the U.S., yet they flourish. Ultimately, if you are passionate about what you do, what people think of you (or not) shouldn&#x27;t matter so much.<p>My personal hypothesis is that people  in America (parents) give way too much responsibility to the school to educate their children and expect magic to happen from people who are merely paid to take care of your children. Quit having kids or take more responsibility in teaching them. My mother is a teacher too and I recall she spent more time teaching me stuff at home before I even went to kindergarten and that definitely helped keep me ahead of the curve. Sure, her ability to teach helped her a bit but surely it is not that hard as a parent to take more of an active interest in your child&#x27;s education rather than flopping helplessly and whining about schools and such. /end rant",1379014918

But I would respectfully suggest that it&#x27;s not a particularly useful statement, because you&#x27;re not comparing SQL to anything.  &quot;Complex SQL queries are hard&quot; because &quot;complex queries are hard&quot;.  If there was a magical tool where you could do complex querying and always have the right answer in the minimal time, then these discussions would never arise.  (To a debatable extent, that is one of the things people are paying for when they choose a &quot;better&quot; database: the hope that they get closer to the ideal on complex queries)<p>Personally, I would much rather perform a complex query in SQL than NoSQL.  The base-line is likely to be not-terrible, which may be good enough for single-use queries.  Optimization is much easier (IMHO) - SQL is a DSL for querying and indexing.  Compared to having to write code to do that (which seems to be the primary NoSQL approach), the DSL approach seems much more efficient.  SQL isn&#x27;t perfect, but it beats no-DSL-support or another DSL that is even worse than SQL :-)",1379014527

I&#x27;m explaining the difference in perceived ethos but I have no problem with HB at all.<p>Second, I think you already realise that your analogy is only analogous in that there&#x27;s a multi-billion dollar company and a much smaller company are both involved.<p>For example, AB InBev makes up half of the US beer sales with Budweiser and Bud Light being the top two US beers and the Budweiser family is the best selling worldwide.  On the other hand, while Valve doesn&#x27;t release many numbers, it&#x27;s estimated that Steam has a strong majority of the PC game digital distribution market and Origin&#x27;s market share is, obviously, lagging far behind.<p>Also, it doesn&#x27;t take into account the vast difference between Origin and Budweiser.  Origin exists to sell you other products and you have to use the service in order for this to happen.  It is difficult to overcome the initial user inertia to get them to join and install the service and to keep it running on their system so that things can be further pushed on them.  Once this inertia is overcome there is very little extra resistance to using the service to purchase games.  This inertia is also increased because the market of people who would use a DRM-full digital distribution service is not at rest but is rather largely moving along happily with another service.  By offering a significant discount on popular games if you start using their service they could convince people to get and run Origin giving them that initial hook.<p>Further, the Humble Bundle was creating an opportunity to have a significant effect on their user numbers. At 50,000,000 users in July, even if only half of the bundle purchasers were new Origin users, that&#x27;s an extra 2% of people using their service, and they created positive exposure to many more that may have also joined or may be more inclined to join in the future.<p>And, finally, I don&#x27;t think HB was attempting to get EA market share at all.  EA was trying to increase Origin market share; Humble Bundle was trying to grow their own service and make some money. (People keep saying the Origin Bundle was &quot;all for charity&quot; or whatever, but don&#x27;t forget that sending a portion of the money to Humble Bundle was an option that I&#x27;m sure some people chose, if only by default.)  Again, I don&#x27;t fault HB for this but it is a noteworthy difference from their prior operations.",1379014351

(If youve written down the combination on a piece of paper and the police demand that you give it to them, that may be a different story.)</i><p>BS interpretations like these make the legal system a big bad joke.<p>The original intention clearly had nothing to do with whether it was something out of your mind or not, and all to do with not being forced to implicate yourself.",1379013689

You are just using your restricted definition of conference (not like a party) to support what you think a conference should be (not like a party).  My take on it is that some conferences <i>empirically do</i> have many similarities to parties.  This doesn&#x27;t make them &#x27;not conferences&#x27;, so saying <i>&quot;their job is to organize a conference, not a party&quot;</i> is setting up a dichotomy that doesn&#x27;t actually exist.<p>If that isn&#x27;t your sort of conference, then no problem, not everything is for everybody.  <i>Personally</i> I prefer more intimate technical conversations over a beer, a bar napkin, and a cellphone than sterile professional presentations in front of a whiteboard.

It was good for plenty reasons: floppy disks don&#x27;t cost much, they&#x27;re reusable, are arguably good at keeping their data (as long as you keep them away from anything magnetic), and had a reasonably long life expectancy, at least considering the materials they&#x27;re made of.<p>Nowadays, the best thing that would come close to floppy disks are SD cards and usb sticks. And even though both sd cards and usbsticks are becoming cheaper every day, they&#x27;re still nowhere near as cheap as floppy disks. And I can&#x27;t think of anyone who would be hoarding hundreds of USB sticks, just to give them away never to be seen again. Additionally, and more obviously, floppy disks can no longer keep up with modern technology: they don&#x27;t allow to store much information at all (roughly 2MB is less than peanuts nowadays. Most of my PDF documents are twice the size), and hardly anyone I know of even has a floppy disk drive anymore.<p>Of course I know about CDroms -- but the thing about CDs is, they require a CDburner, and the process requires a while. Certainly not as much as it used to, but this factor persists. Also, unless you use CDRW, the data is permanently stored onto it, and if you no longer need it, it just becomes a pice of worthless, non-resuable plastic.<p>So what alternatives are there, alternatives that don&#x27;t involve cloud sharing? What hardware-based mediums do we have that allows sharing data in a cheap, disposable way, that doesn&#x27;t require me to store data on the internet?<p>What is there to expect in the future?",1379013455

What we have now are essentially a shortlist of known mutations that are seen across many cancers, a huge list of closely associated mutations in the same pathway or impinging pathways that are sometimes seen in conjunction with other mutations, sometimes not and then a ton of noise from which researchers are trying to pick out possible correlation.  The vast majority of mutations are not cancer causing, so picking out the ones that are is difficult.  That being said, frequently broad characterization can be done.  This person has an effected PI3Kinase, or MAP pathway.  We only have drugs for a few of the major mutations so once the cancer mutates to avoid drugging, patients are often out of luck.<p>To answer your second question, cancer is generally accepted as a genetic disease ie mutations, copy number alterations, insertion and deletion of genetic information, however, recent research has shown that epigenetic processes (that is what your cells are doing with your genes such as alternative splicing or DNA methylation) are also an important factor and these can be effected by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, even mood.",1379012934

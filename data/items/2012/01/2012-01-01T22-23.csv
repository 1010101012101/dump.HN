I found denying the existence of children to be a rather poorly justified in the article but you provided a decent justification.<p>I think parents often treat their children as children because of the formation of habits that start from the child being a baby. They get used to them being helpless, design their behavior around that, and then fail to notice when that situation changes. When this occurs it almost become the child’s responsibility to say ”Hey, I can do new stuff now!” periodically (most frequently in teenage years), at which point it is usually ignored. Another reason: letting your kids do the stuff that you used to do for them means letting go of some control. Parents worry what would happen if they allowed their child to do the things that they do: “Sure I could let my child cook their own meals but what if they just cooked lots of unhealthy food.”",1325458344

Lurid riot porn is not a victory condition.<p>One problem is the attitude mentioned in the article: ""This has been a show of bravado that has the tactical benefits of providing media coverage of the brutal methods of police and the benefit of draining the resources of the oppressor by forcing them to incur the expense of arresting and prosecuting people for trivial offenses."" (Keep in mind that the US imprisons its populace far more than any other nation, so this is no joke.) I read this rebuttal recently:<p><i>""Getting arrested as an unavoidable consequence of standing up for a cause is noble; getting arrested as a voluntary, symbolic act is widely considered bizarre, at best. Moreover, it frustrates huge sectors of the movement who see an opportunity cost to the resources that go into unnecessary jail support, bail, and legal costs. Perhaps worst of all, voluntary arrest is seen by members of especially targeted communities as flaunting arrestees’ race and class privilege.""</i><p>(<a href=""http://www.zcommunications.org/pacifism-and-diversity-of-tactics-a-compromise-proposal-by-brian-dominick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zcommunications.org/pacifism-and-diversity-of-tac...</a>)",1325458093

3414058,comment,3412891,3412891,0,0,rosariom,,,"This is the experienced developers dilemma: ""To engineer or to not engineer""; engineering usually turning out to be over engineering. A more experienced developer friend of mine would always tell me: ""build for today's requirements"". I try hard to fight the design/architect voices in my head that always want to imagine this made up future where we will need X or else we cannot go live. These voices usually only stall real actual work, instill fear, and serve very little to no purpose.<p>I once had an argument with a Wall Street Java developer who was made the ""lead"" of one of our team projects. He decreed that every single class have an interface so that we can be generic and not tightly couple any of the components to concrete classes. I agreed that in some instances where functionality, i.e. methods that can be represented by different classes with the same method signatures made sense but not every single class needs an interface (if that is the case just go with a beautiful dynamically typed language like Python and avoid the code bloat). He got management on his side and we went off and built an overly engineered Straight Through Processing solution. It was a sheer nightmare to debug and the code bloat made me scream one day when we had a serious production issue. Even our manager (who finally had to look at the code when most of us were out on vacation once to answer some user questions) was flabbergasted at the amount of code he had to read through in order to answer the most trivial of questions. One extreme example was an interface for trade references. Our trade references were always strings with a date and some numeric value concatenated to it. The ""engineer"" decided that we needed an interface for this and added one interface and concrete class for our trade references. I told him that all classes needing trade references instance variables could just have a String instance variable named tradeReference or something like that and he went on to give me a design pattern lecture. We argued for nearly 20 minutes about this silly thing as he kept insisting that the future was unknown so we have to future proof the code from unforeseeable changes. When he said this I asked him to remove the Crystal ball plugin he had in Eclipse for predicting the future and get real. He got angry and we had a team call to waste yet another hour of developer time to discuss this. In the call I mentioned that our trade references scheme had not changed in 8 years and was unlikely to change... I lost the debate anyway. The ratio for most of the code base from interface to concrete class was largely 1-1 thus not justifying this code bloat approach.<p>Experienced developers (at least I think) seem to have these crystal balls in their heads or IDEs and usually try to be clairvoyant when it comes down to building a product. We need to get out of the business of overly engineering and just do as my friend said: ""build for today's requirements"". It is called software for a reason: it is soft. It can change (most likely will), can be refactored, redesigned, and/or incrementally made better or more abstract to accommodate changes. I am in no way saying no design, just limit it and get to work. A successfully built product is more satisfying then the imaginations of your head and the ""perfect"" engineering/scaling solution that never materializes. Users will like you, you will like you, and the team will get an andrenaline boost with each and every release keeping the spirits high. Remove the Crystal ball plugin from your head/IDE and stop trying to be clairvoyant and be a developer.",1325457951

If it's awesome, I might consider re-writing it, learning from the mistakes or architectural flaws of my first design. Note that the very first revision can usually be dropped in favor of a paper design of the thing, where you can visualize the flaws before writing the first line, and correct them before you start typing.<p>There are also things that I have that technically work, but are ugly, but are never getting fixed. I learned from them and it's fun to look back at how much better I got over time. I could probably go back and turn everything into nice classes and remove big blocks of commented-out code, but...it'd be pointless. I'd rather work on something new and do it better the next time. Tackling exciting new problems is what makes coding interesting for me, and I'd hate to lose that ""just"" to be proper.<p>I like to think of my lang dirs in my homedir (ruby, c, python, js, php, etc) as language-specific ""coding sketchbooks"" where I'm developing recipes that I might borrow from later.

I see none of the effects.<p>To me, this is as bad as hover effects on tablets. I just can't see how it helps to improve user experience or accessibility. Sure, sometimes that isn't the desire but even in the case of those marketing sites I'm fairly sure the marketing men behind it would be appalled to find out some of their target audience was communicated to poorly. Though the worst thing is those same people on other sites then disable some key presses and default keyboard short-cuts to make sure there is no choice but to go through the bad UX to be communicated to.<p>What worries me when I see these things so high up on HN is that I fear others think this stuff is good.<p>Is that the case?

4042247,comment,4042011,4042011,10,0,judofyr,,,"My thoughts on this 630 days ago  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1671437"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1671437</a>:<p>Ive been doing some research for this earlier, and my conclusion was: This is very hard, if not impossible, to implement automatically. The main problem is that its impossible to handle exceptions correctly without making the whole stack aware of it.<p>Currently, when an exception occurs, the system can simply change the response (since the response hasnt been sent to the client yet, but is only buffered inside the system). With this approach, a response can be in x different states: before flushing, after the 1st flushing,  and after the xth flushing. And after the 1st flushing, the status, headers and some content has been sent to the client.<p>Imagine that something raises an exception after the 1st flushing. Then a 200 status has already been sent, togeher with some headers and some content. First of all, the system has to make sure the HTML is valid and at least give the user some feedback. Its not impossible, but still a quite hard problem (because ERB doesnt give us any hint of where tags are open/closed). The system also need to take care of all the x different state and return correct HTML in all of them.
Another issue is that were actually sending an error page with a 200 status. This means that the response is cacheable with whatever caching rules you decied earlier in the controller (before you knew that an error will occur). Suddenly you have your 500.html cached all over the placed, at the client-side, in your reverse proxy and everywhere.<p>Lets not forget that exceptions dont always render the error page, but do other things as well. For instance, sometimes an exception is raised to tell the system that the user needs to be authenticated or doesnt have permission to do something. These are often implemented as Rack middlewares, but with automatic flushing they also need to take care of each x states. And if it for instance needs to redirect the user, it cant change the status/headers to a 302/Location if its already in the 1st state, and therefore needs to inject a <script>window.location=foo</script> in a cacheable 200 response.<p>Of course, the views shouldnt really raise any exceptions because it should be dumb. However, in Rails its very usual in Rails to defer the expensive method calls to the view. The controllers sets everything up, but its not until it needs to be rendered that its actually called. This increases the possibility that an exception is raised in the rendering phrase.<p>Maybe Im just not smart enough, but I just cant come up with a way to tackle all of these problems (completely automated) without requiring any changes in the app.",1338375229

To me, the Google Webmaster Tools information is more actionable. I have a number of different pages optimized or certain key phrases. I can look at keyword rankings and prioritize SEO. I can spot high impression keywords that I don't have a targeted page for, and create one. I can look at the CTR and see which page descriptions could be tweaked to get a higher CTR.

""to me"" = acknowledging my own subjectivity. ""for a buyer"" = a generalised group. Weird.<p>> because apparently its not worth their time; but at the same time, according to them it takes zero involvement from their part.<p>They didn't say ""not worth [their] time"". They said that it didn't fit with their core businesses and as a result they are spinning it off. Those are two different things. Sortfolio has been running without engineering support for a while, but it still costs them hosting and support, plus the fact that they have a fiduciary responsibility for a product which they aren't excited about and doesn't fit with their core business. This is their iPod HiFi.<p>> Doesn't answer any important questions regarding the sale on flippa. Either its not worth their time or they are not telling the whole story.<p>I think they are telling the whole story at a narrative level but not at a numbers level. No information about whether customer data transfers, etc. I don't see any reason not to believe them when they say that the business is profitable and they believe it could be grown. It's an alien concept to most people that a business making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year isn't wanted by its owner, but it happens. It's a smart move. Sortfolio is a mental distraction. They aren't putting man hours into it, but that doesn't mean it's not at the back of their minds. Having $20k of revenue per month = giving a shit about who it came from.<p>> As someone who would use sortfolio this looks like a complete lack of confidence on the business/platform by their owners and has unstable future as a product, so why bother using the service?<p>That doesn't make it a bad investment for someone. It means you shouldn't use it yourself. It's debatable that 37signals' brand has made the platform what it is (a C+ or B- web service which generates revenue), but I know plenty of people who could take it and make it a six-month project to increase revenues and give it some more clout. Do you believe that fundamentally there is a market for this sort of product? If so then you have a great head start by buying Sortfolio.<p>> Sortfolio almost definitely exist as a platform and makes money simply because of its association with 37singnals. The product is nether impressive or unique.<p>I agree that its success to date has been largely defined by the 37signals brand. I find the product moderately impressive in its restraint. I'll be interested to see where it goes from here.",1338372730

Pengobatan Alami Infeksi Saluran Kemih
yang aman tanpa efek samping!<p>Infeksi saluran kemih (ISK) adalah infeksi bakteri yang terjadi pada saluran kemih. Infeksi saluran kemih merupakan kasus yang sering terjadi dalam dunia kedokteran. Walaupun terdiri dari berbagai cairan, garam, dan produk buangan, biasanya urin tidak mengandung bakteri. Jika bakteri menuju kandung kemih atau ginjal dan berkembang biak dalam urin, terjadilah ISK. Jenis ISK yang paling umum adalah infeksi kandung kemih yang sering juga disebut sebagai sistitis. Gejala yang dapat timbul dari ISK yaitu perasaan tidak enak berkemih (disuria, Jawa: anyang-anyangen). Tidak semua Infeksi saluran kemih menimbulkan gejala, Infeksi saluran kemih yang tidak menimbulkan gejala disebut sebagai Infeksi saluran kemih asimtomatis.<p>Penyebab :<p>Infeksi saluran kemih dapat disebabkan oleh kebiasaan yang tidak baik (kurang minum, menahan kemih), kateterisasi, dan penyakit serta kelainan lain. serta berhubungan dengan gonta ganti pasangan..yang kita tidak tau juga kalau pasangan itu membawa bakteri dari pasangan lain. terutama kalau sitem ketahanan tubuh sudah berkurang, apa saja jenis bakteri akan sangat gampang sekali masuk ke dalam tubuh selain gaya hidup yg kurang sehat terlalu banyak mengkonsumsi vitamin c dosis tinggi, dan mengkonsumsi kopi manis, dan susu sebagi pemicu terjadinya ISK karena urine yg melewati saluran kemih mengandung asam urat sehingga hal ini dapat memicu terjadinya batu ginjal pada saluran kemih yg dapat menyebabkan peradangan pada saluran kantung kemih.<p>Pencegahan :<p>Infeksi saluran kemih dapat dicegah dengan banyak minum dan tidak menahan kemih, sebagai upaya untuk membersihkan saluran kemih dari kuman. Bagi penderita ISK, kedua hal tersebut lebih ditekankan lagi karena ISK dapat menimbulkan lingkaran setan. Penderita ISK dengan disuria cenderung untuk menahan kemih, padahal menahan kemih itu sendiri dapat memperberat ISK.seyogyanya banyak mengkonsumsi air minum 8 gelas sehari atau 2,5liter dalam sehari sehingga dapat mengurangi resiko terkena ISK.
Untuk mengurangi risiko ISK pada kateterisasi, perlu kateterisasi yang tepat. Hal-hal yang perlu diperhatikan dalam kateterisasi antara lain jenis kateter, teknik dan lama kateterisasi.<p>Namun kami lebih menyarankan dnegan Pengobatan Alami Infeksi Saluran Kemih yaitu salah satu yang bisa di lakukan untuk pencegahan, Namun perlu anda ketahui bahwa Pengobatan Alami Infeksi Saluran Kemih  bukan hanya mengobati ISK tapi dapat di jadikan sebagai pengobatan berbagai penyakit lainnya, Karena Pengobatan Alami Infeksi Saluran Kemih mengandalkan bahan yang alami yang aman dan baik untuk dikonsumsi. Pengobatan Alami Infeksi Saluran Kemih  dengan Jus Kulit Manggis Xathone Plus yang banyak khasiat dan manfaatnya untuk pengobatan berbagai penyakit, Karena diketahui mengandung Xamthone sebagai anti oksidan, anti proliferativ, anti inflamasi dan antimikrobial. Sifat antioksidan manggis melebihi vitamin E dan vitamin C. Xanthone yg terdapat di manggis merupakan subtansi kimia alami yang tergolong senyawa polyhenolic. Peneliti dari Universitas Taichung di Taiwan telah mengisolasi xanthone dan deviratnya dari kulit buah manggis ( pericarp ) di antaranya diketahui adalah 3-isomangoestein, alpha mangostin, Gamma-mangostin, Garcinone A, Garcinone B, C, D dan garcinone E, maclurin, mangostenol. Sebuah penelitian di Singapura menunjukan bahwa sifat antioksidan pada buah manggis jauh lebih efektif bila dibandingkan dengan antioksidan pada rambutan dan durian. Xanthone tidak ditemui pada buah-buahan lainnya kecuali pada buah manggis, karena itu manggis di dunia diberikan julukan Queen of Fruit atau Si Ratu Buah.
Dari berbagai penelitian kandungan xanthone dan derivatnya efektif melawan kanker payudara secara in-vitro, dan obat penyakit jantung. Kasiat garcinone E (devirat xanthone) ini jauh lebih efektif untuk menghambat kanker bila dibandingkan dengan obat kanker seperti flaraucil, cisplatin, vincristin, metohotrexete, dan mitoxiantrone.

Some people aren't so lucky.<p>I had my own medical struggle while in the middle of grad school.  Mid October a few years ago, I contracted a rather nasty respiratory infection.  Among other things, I was severely fatigued and needed to sleep for extended amounts of time (think 12+ hours a day).  The excessive sleeping didn't worry me while I was busy hacking and coughing, but when the respiratory symptoms had gone away a couple weeks later, I was still left with the extreme fatigue and hypersomnia.<p>Normally, I'm not one to run to a doctor at the slightest sign of any illness, but I began to get worried a week or so after the acute infection passed and I was still sleeping a minimum of 12+ hours a day.  (I should emphasize, too, this really was a minimum, not an average -- I'd typically wake up around 8 am, go to class and do other things until around 2 or 3, come home and fall asleep around 4 PM and wake up and do it again the next day.  One weekend, I think I was awake for a total of about 8 hours over the two days.)<p>I went through the usual struggle anyone who has anything that's at least mildly rare goes through, and, after visiting a sleep neurologist, I got my diagnosis: post-infectious idiopathic hypersomnia.  I then knew this was a problem that was going to take months or years to resolve, and, for a while, I thought my life was effectively over.<p>But, the real kick in the teeth was that word, ""idiopathic."" There's a great line on an episode of House where one of the fellows suggests a diagnosis of idiopathic something-or-other, and House responds ""'idiopathic,' from the Latin meaning we're idiots because we can't figure it out.""  So, there I was, with a diagnosis that amounted to ""you sleep a lot and we don't know why,"" and the only treatment available was basically stimulants to treat the symptoms (which didn't work well at all -- I slept less, but I was walking around like a zombie by early afternoon every day).<p>Looking back, I consider myself lucky that it happened while I was in school, since I could have easily found myself unemployed and broke if I were in less flexible circumstances at the time.  I'm also quite lucky that it resolved itself within about 9 months.  I effectively lost a semester of grad school that I had to make up later, but I recovered, and it should never recur.<p>I don't know if what I had is what would be considered a ""rare"" disease by the strict definition, but it's rare enough that your average primary care physician might not ever see a case in his or her life, and a sleep specialist might see a handful.  It's rare enough that there don't seem to be any studies or research available on the condition, on top of the obvious difficulties of studying people who effectively have to sleep 1/2-3/4 of the day.<p>So, back to my original point: my best wishes to you and your son, of course, but please take comfort in the fact you know exactly what is wrong.",1338372210

nation's leading purveyor of buzzwords, catch phrases and clichs for
people too busy to speak in plain English. Business Finance
contributing editor Dan Danbom interviewed Lingua in his NYC office.<p>Danbom: Is being a cliche expert a full-time job?<p>Lingua: Bottom line is I have a full plate 24/7.<p>Danbom: Is it hard to keep up with the seemingly endless supply of
clichs that spew from business?<p>Lingua: Some days, I don't have the bandwidth. It's like drinking from
a fire hydrant.<p>Danbom: So it's difficult?<p>Lingua: Harder than nailing Jell-O to the wall.<p>Danbom: Where do most clichs come from?<p>Lingua: Stakeholders push the envelope until it's outside the box.<p>Danbom: How do you track them once they've been coined?<p>Lingua: It's like herding cats.<p>Danbom: Can you predict whether a phrase is going to become a clich?<p>Lingua: Yes. I skate to where the puck's going to be. Because if you
aren't the lead dog, you're not providing a customer-centric proactive
solution.<p>Danbom: Give us a new buzzword that we'll be hearing ad nauseam.<p>Lingua: ""Enronitis"" could be a next-generation player.<p>Danbom: Do people understand your role as a clich expert?<p>Lingua: No, they can't get their arms around that. But they aren't incented to.<p>Danbom: How do people know you're a clich expert?<p>Lingua: I walk the walk and talk the talk.<p>Danbom: Did incomprehensibility come naturally to you?<p>Lingua: I wasn't wired that way, but it became mission-critical as I
strategically focused on my go-forward plan.<p>Danbom: What did you do to develop this talent?<p>Lingua: It's not rocket science. It's not brain surgery. When you
drill down to the granular level, it's just basic blocking and
tackling.<p>Danbom: How do you know if you're successful in your work?<p>Lingua: At the end of the day, it's all about robust, world-class
language solutions.<p>Danbom: How do you stay ahead of others in the buzzword industry?<p>Lingua: Net-net, my value proposition is based on maximizing synergies
and being first to market with a leveraged, value-added deliverable.
That's the opportunity space on a level playing field.<p>Danbom: Does everyone in business eventually devolve into the sort of
mindless drivel you spout?<p>Lingua: If you walk like a duck and talk like a duck, you're a duck.

The main (timekeeping) mechanism extracts energy from thermal differences between day and night, and may also be wound by humans.<p>Moreover, if the main mechanism's reserve accumulates enough energy, it is engineered to overflow and wind up the chime mechanism -- thus the chime will ring once in a while even without humans to wind it.

So how does the Clock keep going if no one visits it for months, or years, or perhaps decades? If it is let to run down between visits, who would keep resetting it? The Clock is designed to run for 10,000 years even if no one ever visits (although it would not display the correct time till someone visited). If there is no attention for long periods of time the Clock uses the energy captured by changes in the temperature between day and night on the mountain top above to power its time-keeping apparatus. In a place like a top of a mountain, this diurnal difference of tens of degrees in temperature is significant and thus powerful. Thermal power has been used for small mantel clocks before, but it has not been done before at this scale. The differential power is transmitted to the interior of the Clock by long metal rods. As long as the sun shines and night comes, the Clock can keep time itself, without human help. But it cant ring its chimes for long by itself, or show the time it knows, so it needs human visitors.",1308911724

It doesn't feel as responsive as firebug and ultimately firebug just helps me do the most basic tasks as quickly as possible.

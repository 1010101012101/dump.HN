2628489,story,,,8,5,ventureawaits,"Ask HN: How do I convert a list of startup ideas into a single, strong vision?",,"Hi HN, I'm the CEO of a small startup in the midwest (this is a throwaway account)<p>I'm in the process of quitting my moderately successful company to start anew. I made the choice once I realized that 1) I'm no longer learning new stuff every day by having to meet new challenges and 2) my current startup has created a great brand but is catering to a small market: After six years in business, it will not grow much further without a large change in product strategy. I would rather put it under different management than bet the company on satisfying my urge to start from square one.<p>For my next startup, I'm currently looking at the ebook space or doing something having to do with daily deals, following the groupon craze but for a different market segment. I also have an urge to go into the app space, developing games or this idea of an awesome social weight-loss app I have.<p>My general problem is that I generate too many business ideas: I have a list of 50 or so put together during the last two months. I'm passionate about each of them for a day or two and I need to convert that day-long enthusiasm into a long-term passion.<p>My current idea of solving this problem is to let it sort itself out. I'm betting that I'm in the middle of a process that will end up with me churning my ideas down to one single vision.\nBut here's the question: is there any way I can hedge this bet? Have you been in a similar situation and/or have any suggestions on how to put the process on fast-track?<p>I'm grateful for any suggestions, including ""shut the fuck up and stay with your current company, dimwit"", if that's your sentiment.",1307440674

Licensing, regulatory and insurance costs alone prove a significant barrier to entry. I also think that as a field matures, so too does the body of knowledge and the amount of time required to become an expert in said field increases. Look at how much more a doctor, lawyer, or account needs to know today than they did 100 years ago.<p>I also think this is unavoidable in software..though I might agree with you that we aren't there yet?

2628474,comment,2628454,2628454,1,0,steventruong,,,"At the risk of going against the opinions of others on here, my personal belief is no one can really predict what will succeed and what will fail. Many will argue that you can tell what makes sense and what doesn't but that's not completely true in all cases. Some ideas that seem like failures at first have gone on to be great successes. Sure, in hindsight its easy for many to say its obvious but most are just full of shit and they don't even realize it. Even those involved in some ideas admit they weren't sure whether or not those ideas were crazy or not.<p>Often times, even some of the biggest ideas out there (and small ones too), sounds ludicrous at the start with hordes of doubters. There are also ideas that have failed, not because the concept or idea itself is bad but the execution was wrong or they took the wrong approach, bad timing, wrong features, etc... and were later found to be a success by someone else.<p>Some ideas may sound dumb (think pet rock) and yet end up making money or are their own success in their own right. You may think that is a one-off example but I've witness enough (and done my own fair share of ideas even I think is ridiculous) that saying you know the idea is doomed to fail is in my honest opinion a bit ignorant and arrogant.<p>As many have said before me, experience is both a blessing and a krytonite in that sometimes experience hinders you from trying what you think is to be a failure until someone else manages to make it a success. Experience is valuable but so is the willingness to try things even if it goes against your belief.<p>That said, whoever said you had to spend months developing and prototyping? You can seek the <i>right</i> crowd (potential users/customers) to iterate whether there is a market or not without a product and in many cases, without a prototype of any kind. If you guys always wait till you have a working MVP to determine whether or not an idea is worth building (although in some cases you absolutely need one albeit rare), then you're probably not doing things right already (especially if this is a common topic that comes up amongst yourselves).",1307439959

And if just one person figures out how to do it, it's broken forever.

Dropbox allows your computer to function as it should--documents should be backed up, safe, and widely accessible. Dropbox merely supplants the role of redundant hard-drive backups and e-mail file transfer. But we've lived with e-mail and file systems for long before the creation of Dropbox. Dropbox is easy to understand because it hasn't added something new, it just helped us live our digital lives with convenience.<p>iCloud shouldn't be easy to understand because it's introducing an entirely novel concept to our digital lives, which is to lift the burden of wires and a fixed connection off consumers. This is a genuine step forward in the movement to unleash our digital lives. It's a totally novel concept so it should be difficult to understand than services like Dropbox.",1307438144

Obviously it makes sense for them to ask for these things, but to me it seems odd to call an organisation with a long term plan and often a number of employees a 'startup'. Organisations that are truly starting up are in much earlier stages of development, trying to decide if there is a market for a particular product and trying to fit this market and generate interest.<p>But the definition you give of a startup seems to be the current interpretation that many people would have.",1307437403

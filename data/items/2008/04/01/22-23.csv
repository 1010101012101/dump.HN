152579,comment,152475,152475,0,0,cadalac,,,"Quoting the article:<p>""This was a particularly difficult lesson for me to learn. I had always believed one should never give up, that once you set a goal, you should hang on to the bitter end. The captain goes down with the ship and all that. If I ever failed to finish a project I started, I’d feel very guilty about it.<p>Eventually I figured out that this is just nonsense.""<p>My thoughts: Louis Sullivan said something like ""The only way to find the truth is to take everything they say, and to test it out for yourself. By doing so you will realize that many things they say are true are not true and many things they say are not true are true.""<p>And he is so right. The amount of false stuff we learn through our life is mind boggling. To make things worse we sometimes invent stuff ourselves.",1207089533

152564,comment,151980,152270,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think in general you are correct, but the devil lies in the details. The way people think about the word ""agile"", oddly enough, can be really inflexible. Somebody gets a CSM, reads a few Cohn books, or gets hooked on Crystal. Suddenly their definition of ""agile"" is exactly what they read -- no more and no less.<p>I read once that a programmer tried agile and gave up after arguing for two hours about what to put on the story card. This kind of BS happens a lot: it's the nature of dealing with large numbers of people who see things as binary. If you understand the _principles_ of agile, and why they work, then all the books and authors are just re-digesting common sense and peddling them as books. At that level of understanding you can work on all sorts of things: new development, existing development, non-software work, etc.<p>That's where my team is trying to take this organization I'm working with. The problem is that influencing large populations (thousands and tens of thousands) of technical people is far worse than herding cats. It's more like trying to get angry flaming weasels to perform circus acts by using a twinkie and a Disney song.",1207088853

152557,comment,152434,152441,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We have several customers using them (technically, every Joyent customer is our customer, too, since they offer Virtualmin on everything they offer), and the satisfaction level seems quite high.  They are definitely among the smartest guys in the hosting business from a technical standpoint, and they build a lot of their technology in-house.  The price is a wee bit high, though it's often difficult to compare virtualized systems in an apples-to-apples manner.  Accelerators are Solaris Zones, which are significantly more efficient than the Linux Xen instances used for EC2, for example.  Zones are comparable in implementation to vservers on Linux, though the most popular form of vserver is Virtuozzo/OpenVZ which has some serious memory bugs that strike when a system is over-subscribed--the low-cost providers all over-subscribe and thus all exhibit these memory allocation issues.  Joyent boxes are quite large and fast, and not over-subscribed, so you might be pleasantly surprised by the performance you see from them.<p>Their support for Ruby on Rails and PHP is excellent, since the techs there are actually coders who know those platforms well.  They also seem to be pretty Perl and Python savvy, though the Solaris packages for Python they use are reportedly problematic for Django.  And, the Joyent forums are full of smart folks doing interesting things, which is pretty valuable.<p>That said, they do have their critics.  Twitter left them in a huff, and at least one Y Combinator company has had a bad experience with them (I don't know the details).  But, every large host has its share of complaints.  It's hard to judge without knowing the number of customers they have in total and the average level of satisfaction of those customers (hmmm...that'd probably be a useful service, along the lines of the J.D. Powers automobile surveys--I wonder if anyone does that?).",1207088498

Suddenly all of the boys start thinking ""she's so smart!"" and ""she's so funny!"" and wanting to hang out with her, and they honestly have no idea that there is any connection between their new attitudes and her new tits.<p>There is no question in my mind that Macs are beautiful. The latest gadgets like the iPods and iPhones are real works of art.<p>Sometimes I wonder if Apple doesn't get cut a bit too much slack just because they are ""cool"". Just because someone is beautiful and smiling at you doesn't necessarily mean they do not have malicious intent. And especially it seems a lot of times, we are just so eager to believe in any credible opponent to M$ that we are willing to overlook any warning signs.

Or however you want to take them:<p>---\nWeb Services  noun  A software development meme that espouses the notion of tying together disparate software components via a crude, non-typesafe, remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism that consists of sending and receiving data encoded in an excessively verbose, plaintext format (XML) over a largely inelegant, stateless file transfer protocol (HTTP).<p>---\nWeb technology is certainly a controversial topic. Despite the fact that building Web applications is about as enjoyable as having one's private parts caught in a cement mixer, it continues to be an extremely popular software development paradigm. It's been said that although there is a certain class of problems for which Web technology is the appropriate solution, your problem is almost certainly not among them, no matter what your problem is. But one would be hard-pressed to convince the industry of it.\n",1195801131

The financial incentives to take care of the disadvantaged just aren't there.</i><p>Maybe something was lost in the translation from reportee to reporter, but capitalism doesn't ""take care"" of anybody. And the incentives to ""take care"" [ie subsidize] the disadvantaged are never going to be there. This is a point of mathematical certainty.<p>The incentives are of a strictly different type--for instance, the incentive of an evil old billionaire trying to buy his way into heaven.",1195798403

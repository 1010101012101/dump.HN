Eg: Some of Nine Inch Nails recent releases have been legally made available over bittorrent in 24/96 high quality.<p>And my drug dealer gave $50 to a pregnant woman so that she could get a taxi to the hospital.<p>If you want to argue why this ruling is wrong you should address the issues of censorship, arguing that The Pirate Bay <i>isn't</i> a site built around copyright infringement (which it is and the founders openly admit this) just does a dis-service to the real problem here (censorship). TPB is a for-profit copyright infringement enabling enterprise, that's why it exists, arguing otherwise is not worth your energy (because ultimately, what does it matter if it enables copyright infringement or not? So do most websites that <i>don't</i> intend on doing that) instead argue that any government should not be disabling access to a website.",1335797949

It's hard to just dive in and start fiddling with code because there are many project-specific abstractions you need to understand before-hand. The new guy on the project has to spend extra time to ""grok"" the idioms of the project. I personally don't see this as a bad thing.<p>The fact is, abstraction is key to programming.

Isn't this just nitpicking on the definition of an integration tests? According to Wikipedia: ""Integration testing [...] is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group."" That's what we are doing here. We are testing that the entire _client-side_ application works as expected.<p>And yes, I totally agree with you regarding the confidence we can have when we mock out our server-side application. But in the context we were working it would be a world of pain to have proper acceptance tests going through the entire stack. They would also take much, much longer time than about a second (we are not in a regular database type application using Rails and all that, this is an enterprise project with many, many years of legacy code in it and an ESB and whatnot).<p>The purpose of these tests for us is first of all to be able to deliver functionality fast and with high confidence, which they, beyond a doubt, has helped us with.",1335794971
3909295,comment,3908088,3908088,2,0,ssharp,,,"This analogy is a huge leap. Aside from the fact that both endeavors are largely entrepreneurial in nature, the two things are mostly distinct.<p>If you are actually trying to succeed as a musician, ""success"", you are going to make a lot of sacrifices. The opportunity costs are huge. If you're touring as a fledgling band, you are most likely giving up the formative years of your career. The time you're spending with music isn't going to be particularly helpful in other arenas. If you're hacking at a startup, you're acquiring desirable skills in the process. If your startup fails, you can still go get a really good job in SV. If your band fails, you're hitting the reset button. You could be chasing a career in the music industry for 10+ years and be no better off than you were a decade ago.<p>I also don't think the analogy between VCs and record companies really hold up either. Because of the low returns of signed bands, as compared to funded companies, the models work differently.<p>Additionally, as a musician, you're ultimately selling a piece of art. It's designed by you, and while it may be influenced by the market, the product is largely determined by your own creativity. A business operates in the exact opposite way. Business as art rarely work. I can give someone a copy of ""Kid A"", have them say ""this sucks"", reply back ""give it a few listens"", and the person may ultimately end up really liking the album. I'm not doing that with a company. If I think a product, say Basecamp, sucks, and I have to pay $20 a month for it, I'm not going to give it much thought after my ""it sucks"" reaction. We consume art differently than we use other products, because they are radically different things. Market demands are simply too important for businesses. They have to listen to the customers to succeed. The path to success is to take customer problems and figure out a creative solution to them. The customer is driving the most substantial part of the company.",1335794920

While I would not call most basic work on websites very complex, I struggle to figure out why it&#x27;s not programming.<p>You are writing a series of inline presentation commands mixed with content, not unlike how Knuth preferred to write (a technique he called literate programming and that frequently went double-meta when he&#x27;d embed TeX documentation for the Tex source code using TeX). This document structure can then be further augmented by directives in one of a few (common, many exist in the margins) ancillary languages, two of which have variables and loops, one of which is Turing complete.<p>Making websites is programming by any reasonable definition of the word. Usually the people I find saying it isn&#x27;t then make arguments that are basically design to exclude anyone who hasn&#x27;t been at it as long as they have. Usually, because they&#x27;re a little insecure about the slow erosion of the barrier to entry to the field.<p>There are plenty of things in our modern world to get your jimmies rustled over, man.

6317650,comment,6315829,6317233,1,0,gizmo686,,,">I see no reason that reality has to be neatly explainable to our tiny little human minds.<p>It doesn&#x27;t. But using the best approximations that our human minds have come up with has produced good results so far, I don&#x27;t see a reason to give up and say that we will never understand it.<p>Regarding the many worlds interpretation. For me, it arose naturally out of the equations we use to describe quantum mechanics (actually quantum computers, but the physics is the same). Assume that a particle is in an even superposition of 2 states. This can be represented by: (|a> + |b>)/sqrt(2), meaning that their is a 50% chance of observing a, and a 50% chance of observing b. When it interacts with another particle, they are said to become entangled. Assume the interaction is such that both particles would be in the same state. The state of the two particle system is now (|aa> + |bb>)/sqrt(2).<p>Note that the state of the second particle is a superposition of the two states. However, consider this from the perspective of the first particle, when it is in the &#x27;a&#x27; state. The second particle is in the &#x27;a&#x27; state as well. Similarly, when the first particle is in the &#x27;b&#x27; state, the second is as well. However, neither particle can observe that the other one (or itself) is in a superposition. As these particles continue to interact, more particles become entangled. Eventually the researcher and equipment become entangled as well. At this point, the equipment can no longer detect that the particles are in a superposition anymore. However, from the perspective of a particle not entangled, it is clear that their is a superposition.<p>The many worlds interpenetration comes from the fact that when you use this model to describe the interaction of all of the particles, the superposition never dissapears. Rather, you are left with a superposition of many different states of the world (Universe), which, if measured, would randomly collapse to one of them (or entangle observer).",1378162203

Emotional Support<p>Author gets emotional support from wife and admits that you <i>will</i> need someone to help you through the shit-storm that is founding a start-up. But most young entrepreneurs don&#x27;t have spouses. Seems like a co-founder fits the bill here.<p>2. External Validation<p>A couple of points: you <i>should</i> listen to your customers, but your customers are a very bad barometer for gauging big company decisions -- sometimes you need to make changes that they won&#x27;t like. Changes that are good for the company (or changes that help you pivot) but piss off significant portions of your customer base; the customer is <i>not</i> always right. So if customers are a bad source of validation, what about other entrepreneurs? Let&#x27;s face it: they are busy with their own projects to give you any meaningful feedback. The author&#x27;s last point is to &quot;write that down&quot; -- seriously? Just get a co-founder.<p>3. Ideas / Brainstorming<p>Brainstorming is not merely spit-balling. Author says that &quot;you want to prevent brainstorming ideas and possible solutions that are inherently not viable or even true&quot; -- but who else knows your company as well as a co-founder? I.e. who else could gauge whether or not solutions are viable (or true)?<p>Let&#x27;s ignore the shameless plug here (and the fact that using a website for brainstorming seems <i>prima facie</i> silly); I just want to point out that brainstorming outside of your company is worthless. You, quite obviously, need to brainstorm with someone <i>in</i> your company. Might as well make it a co-founder.<p>4. Skills / Capacity<p>It seems pretty obvious that you want to do something in the tech arena, you need to be pretty tech-savvy. If you&#x27;re not tech-savvy, you need to associate yourself with someone that is. There&#x27;s a good reason investors don&#x27;t invest in business people. I remember listening to a talk by some of the people at Mint. One of their anecdotes went something like so: &quot;When you go and pitch to a VC, every programmer is +$50mil in valuation, and every suit & tie &quot;business guy&quot; is -$100mil in valuation.&quot;<p>Apart from the intuitive attractiveness of this train of thought, there also has not (ever) been a successful &quot;business guy&quot; with no tech expertise and no technical co-founder doing much of anything in the start-up world.<p>Finally, let me just say that the people at YC know what they are doing. They rarely accept single-founder start-ups for a very good (and obvious) reason. The lack of technical expertise is also a big red flag. After all, if I&#x27;ve never seen the inside of an engine why would a bank fund an auto-shop I want to build.",1378161035

His conclusion was that humans are inherently selfish, shrewd, and spontaneously generate stratagems during everyday interactions.

Not perfectly and not always, but in general.  Some projects make this explicit, and the Debian Project is among the best-known examples, having a Philosophy, a Constitution, and a Policy, all as explicitly stated documents, detailing what the goals, concerns, and specific actions and rules of the project are.<p>Contrast with the proprietary software world in which the goal generally is profit maximization, often with short-term interests, and often sacrificing user experience in the process.  Some companies avoid the pitfalls of this focus to a greater extent -- Apple has long placed end-user experience above all else, and, though I&#x27;m not a particular fan of the result, I can see its appeal especially for less-technical users.<p>Microsoft, by contrast, has from its beginning a winner-takes-all dominance strategy and had as its key customers OEMs and large businesses.  I as an individual user (or developer, or administrator) am well down the priority list.  Oracle would be another company whose alignment is often at odds with mine -- and extends to its stewardship of its free software projects (the core of which has largely migrated elsewhere, somewhat predictably).  And yes, other free software companies can get confounded missions -- I&#x27;d classify much of the issues I encounter with Red Hat and GNOME as being fundamental to the mission and goals of the projects.<p>In the Web space, there are a relative handful of successful models:<p>- Amateur hour:  not in the sense of &quot;unpolished and crude&quot;, but literally &quot;a work of love&quot;.  Something done by an individual (or sometimes small group) out of passion.  Often surprisingly good, but intrinsically limited in both scope and technical capability absent some larger base of support or organization.<p>- Propaganda:  Whether it&#x27;s selling a specific good (as opposed to mass advertising) or a philosophy, this is _somebody with a message_.  H/N falls somewhat under this category.<p>- Public service:  Sites such as Wikipedia.  Often donor or sponsor supported.  One way of scaling amateur hour.<p>- Commerce:  Directly selling some good or product.  Can still lead to a significant informational / conversational role, e.g., Craigslist or Amazon forums.<p>- Advertising:  An aggregator of eyeballs.  In which case, the particulars of the user base are of interest to the site (and its advertisers).  And there&#x27;s also often a very conscious effort to water down content to appeal to the greatest number.  Both of these can set up perverse incentives which tend to drive down the ultimate value and quality of the site.  Google has historically balanced the interests of its users (e.g., the product) and its customers (the advertisers), though I&#x27;m seeing a bit of a drift lately.  Among the challenges:  advertising and marketing teams increase in prominence within the company, chasing out the technical and user-focused talent (e.g., Marissa Meyer).  Though she&#x27;s landed at a company which is much, much further down the &quot;provide benefit to advertisers&quot; scale.<p>Then there&#x27;s the additional issue that state surveillance (and hacker communities) have a significant interest in such data troves.<p>One of the advantages to being pithy is that there&#x27;s an implicitly referenced and much longer argument which takes too long to type.<p>So, include above by default in &quot;If you&#x27;re not paying for it, you&#x27;re the product.&quot;",1378159819

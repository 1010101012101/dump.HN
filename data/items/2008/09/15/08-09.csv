(As in, trolling your OWN site and using it to keep people in the loop is surprisingly easy.)<p>Pay attention to your heavy users, or the people with lots of friends, or various other metrics of activity. Many times, they can become your friends with minimal effort, and soon they'll IM you whenever they hit a bug, and tell all their friends. The more you know about their lives, and the ""problems"" that your site is solving, the more focused and direct the work can be.<p>Yay internet.",1221468305

The order exempted anyone whose ""usual and customary"" business required gold. (Dentists and jewelers come to mind. Electronic fabricators would come under this once electronics was invented.) Anyone could own up to $100 in gold coin. In 1933, $100 was two or three months wages for the average worker, about $6000 to $10,000 in today's money.'",1221467878

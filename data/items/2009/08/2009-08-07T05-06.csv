It then <i>removes</i> all the results from the set that google or any other regular search engine would show you.<p>- 'deadmansknob', I've been playing around with this idea for a long time but never got around to building it, a service which you need to check in to periodically and when you don't one or more emails are sent out. 3 levels of 'periods', a day, a week, a month and trigger-able alarms for special cases (such as holidays).<p>You'd use that to set up a series of emails containing messages to people that you only want activated in case something happens to you. The various levels are to make sure that really crucial information can be held back in case you are in some kind of accident but still alive. Expand featureset at will :)<p>- World Wide orphans: a place where you can dump your no longer wanted domain. It would automatically spider the old site and then set up a web server to handle the reguests. Strictly static. For people that run out of $ on their hosting that put lots of time and effort into sites that then disappear from the net.

The purpose of breaking out code in to subroutines isn't only for code reuse.  If you don't break out code in to subroutines, at some point your code is going to become unwieldy and difficult to read.<p>I try to stick to the rule of having each subroutine consist of no more than a page of code (so that each subroutine can be seen all at one time, without needing to scroll).  Often that leads me to break up the subroutine in to many other subroutines.  This improves readability greatly and makes it much easier to reason about the code.

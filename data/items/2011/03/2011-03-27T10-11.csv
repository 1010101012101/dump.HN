2374704,comment,2374228,2374228,2,0,Mz,,,"I'm not much of a phone person these days (which is funny because pre-internet, my phone was practically surgically attached to my ear).  I got rid of the land line because it was costing big bucks to almost never use it.  I researched the cheapest phone option I could find. I got a prepay cell phone that I keep for calling my mom (who is not on the internet) and for dealing with other calls I occasionally need to make. At first, I carried it with me.  These days, it mostly sits on the counter at home and is so ignored that I periodically pick it up only to find the battery is so low that I need to charge it before I can use it. And, really, I frequently just plan to make calls from the free phones available in the phone room at work.<p>Of course, I also don't have much of a social life at the moment so I don't deal with most of the scenarios referenced here (like meeting people at a predetermined time).",1301223324

The ones using Plutonium, the breeders, the ones with large storage sites full of spent fuel, etc.<p>The Thorium reactor has a lot of problems. Engineering problems that are not solved.<p>Remember the German Thorium reactor, the HTR 300. It died with a whimper.<p>What we really don't need is giving nuclear engineers more money to create huge nightmares.<p>The first thing before ANY nuclear engineer could come back with another idea is to provide us with a safe storage technology and clean up failed attempts like in Asse II.<p>Believing that the next hundred billions on new nuclear technology will be better spend than the last ones, is just naive. Especially given that the basic question of storing the waste is totally unsolved. The US abandoned now Yucca. Germany has also no storage site. Instead the waste is piling up in totally inadequate places - spent fuel is stored in pools near reactors and in dry storage near reactors.",1301223191

Those plants are fairly ancient. Newer facilities have much safer designs.</i><p>I don't like commenting on things I know only a little about, however, one thing is getting overlooked when people make this argument.<p>The newer designs are usually PWRs which are stable by design as loss of water or power slows down the reaction. Unfortunately, they are expensive to build (billions of dollars) and have a limited life due to the challenges of containing pressure with metals exposed to radiation. This makes them barely economic over their lifetime at todays energy prices.<p>The UK has allowed the planning and building of new PWRs. Unfortunately, the companies involved are reluctant to go ahead without some sort of subsidy or carbon tax.<p>If any of the above is wrong, I'd like to be corrected. However, I feel this is a valid point that is rarely made.",1301223156

Sadly, when I have reached my destination, and ""close"" the window, it continues to use the GPS and other battery sucking things to the point where I have to manually go and kill it via the kill-menu (which is all I ever use the fast-switch menu for).<p>I'm not saying this is Apple's fault, but that it's very hard to work out when someone has ""finished"" with an app that could continue to, say, provide information about what the user is doing to a third party, or sucking battery life, or making annoying noises, for example.

At best these are left un-sourced, at worst they seem to be based purely on personal experience. Yet most of these are or could be topics of unbias study. A few examples:<p><i>Buy a nice bed.  Buy a very nice mattress and high-thread-count sheets.  You will need to test out a variety of mattresses to find the one that fits you best but if you find the right one, it will greatly enhance the quality of your sleep, and subsequently, your waking life.</i><p>Why is it that more expensive mattresses = better sleep? Cite the evidence showing that high thread-count sheets = better sleep, which in tern laeds to improvements in waking life.<p><i>You can accomplish more if you work less and sleep more. Hypothetically a well-rested person working 55-hour work weeks can usually outperform a sleep-deprived person working 80-hour work weeks in terms of quality, all else equal (specifically for knowledge work).</i><p>Hypothetically this isn't true at all. Is there evidence to support this hypothesis or not? If not, this adds nothing to the debate.<p><i>You can pay the farmer, or you can pay the doctor. Prevention (i.e. good diet and food ingredients) is an order of magnitude cheaper than treatment (most age-related diseases are correlated with poor dietary choices).</i><p>This is trite and catch-all. What is good diet? There is no common agreement (see: high carb/high protein/high fat discussions). Show the evidence that this is 'an order of magnitude' cheaper than treatment. What are 'good ingredients'. You recommend free-range meats? Grass-fed beef? Locally produced? Define 'good'.<p><i>A cheap chair and mattress may end up costing you 10-20x in doctor's bills.</i><p>Says who? 10-20x seems pretty specific - what's the citation on that? A 'cheap' chair - so is price the only metric? Any $2000 chair is worth it and saves money on doctor's bills? Doesn't it matter how often i spend sitting? Could there not be cheap chairs that are actually better than many expensive ones? What's an 'expensive' mattress?<p><i>Spoken communication has a massive non-verbal component. Study body language and you'll be pretty shocked at how often peoples' spoken words contradict their telltale non-verbal cues.</i><p>Citation please. A lot of the 'non-verbal communication' stuff (read: NLP) is considered unscientific gumf.<p>Don't get me wrong, there's some great advice in here. But around half is stuff that can be scientifically demonstrated and just off-handedly saying something is invalid whilst proclaiming the opposite without providing any citations is counter-productive. It just encourages ""common knowledge"" of the same old wives tales and folklore that it itself is trying to counteract.",1301222414

From then on you can use a nice constant for your sentinel.<p>Also, your sentinel is more range-check safe then it would have been if it were an int (the classic ""if (x < sizeof(arr)) arr[x] = 1;"" issue again)<p>> For example, counting backwards through the elements of some container:<p>Ok, that is a fair point.

I don't think it loses much clarity.<p>> For example, counting backwards through the elements of some container:<p>You missed my point.  I mean warnings caused by ""oops, that's not the variable I meant to compare with there""<p>It's a similar story with ""const"".  One of the great side-benefits of using ""const"" consistently is that suddenly you find that the compiler starts catching more of your dumb mistakes (""oh I thought this was called like func(dest,src) but it's actually func(src,dest)""  The moral is that ""more info to the compiler"" translates to ""compiler notices a larger percentage of your dumb mistakes""<p>> It's impossible to convince people labouring under tyranny they've learned to love without them experiencing a free life first.<p>Melodramatic much?",1301220227

That's not a factor for News.YC, but for the average startup those are good people to have know about you.<p>Also, the traffic boost is probably ordinarily more than 4k uniques.  We probably have a fairly big overlap with TC readers.",1205251054

Its easy to say that you will get everything done if only you had the time, but many times its just an excuse (as you stated). Do you have the summer off?

134278,comment,133727,133757,0,0,hobbs,,,"Zeno is still my favorite. To summarize in modern terms: in order for a particle to move 1 inch, it must first move 1/2 inch. Before it can move 1/2 inch, it must move 1/4 inch. Before it can move 1/4 inch, it must move 1/8 inch. And so on. The paradox is, if a particle has to traverse an infinite number of infinitely small spaces before it can move even one inch, how is it possible that it can move at all?<p>Some mathematicians pull out calculus to ""disprove"" the paradox, but to me it disproves nothing. For example, you can show, mathematically, that sum( 1/(2^N) ) = 1 as N goes from 1 to infinity. The problem is that you <i>have</i> to go to infinity before it will sum to 1. If space is <i>infinitely</i> divisible and a particle has to traverse an <i>infinite</i> number of subspaces in order to move just a nanometer, I still don't see how it's possible that it could move at all.",1205249767

The effect of the spike was diminished by being spread over 2 days, because we use GMT days for stats.<p>The most dramatic change was the number of new accounts.  There were 258 new accounts in the last 24 hours.  On a typical day there are 50-60.<p>The most interesting thing to me was that the TC traffic exposed a design flaw in the account creation code.  That's why the site got so slow yesterday.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=133804"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=133804</a>",1205249568

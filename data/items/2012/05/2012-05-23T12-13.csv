4012805,comment,4010297,4011241,2,0,goostavos,,,">My biggest issue with the anti-union crowd is that they don't realize that Unions are just another competing force, except instead of competing in the marketplace, they're competing in the production line. Why do you think our golden example, Silicon Valley, has managed to stay away from unions? It's because of treating their workers pretty damn well, by anyone's standards.<p>I disagree. The problems with unions is that they <i>don't</i> have to compete. If hiring a union worker <i>were an option</i>, then yes, they'd be competing. But that's not how it works. It's hire them or be fined. Period. That's how it works. Being <i>forced</i> to hire a local guy at $40 an hour just because I'm in their jurisdiction is strictly <i>anti</i>-competitive. The world isn't huge anymore. Forcing to hire local makes no sense when there are better people (<i>ahem</i> me! <i>ahem</i>) suited for the work.",1337777972

4012801,comment,4005224,4008710,2,0,muraiki,,,"You make good points. ""Is there an objective criteria for distinguishing between good and bad obsessions?"" I think that the nuance we are trying to capture is the difference between being passionate about something and being obsessed. And I think that where we can draw the line is at the psychological health of each person, although it might not be the most objective measure. Let me explain.<p>My wife was a national champion in college soccer. She ended up switching schools, but for the time that she was playing college soccer she got nearly full tuition. She certainly was in top physical shape. These all seem like good accomplishments, but she always tells people that she wishes she hadn't done soccer. There are small reasons like the wear and tear on her body, and her feeling that she would have more greatly enjoyed piano (which she's since taken up again).<p>But ultimately, the thing that she says bothered her the most was the kind of person that competitive soccer turned her into. The effect upon her personality and the way she treated other people was very negative. I won't relate the adjectives that she uses to describe herself at the time, but what's important is that the dividing line for her as to whether all her effort in soccer was worth it or not was _the kind of person it made her become_.<p>I'm not a psychologist so I can't really go much further with this. It probably isn't the most objective criteria, as it depends on one's value system. Certainly there are exceptions, like an alcoholic who thinks that he is really enjoying life. But if we were to talk about what seems to be more subtle obsessions, as opposed to chemical addictions, the one thing I can see that is common to both my wife and I -- her having done something that most people would have valued and I having done something that didn't result in much positive benefit -- is that neither of us liked the type of person that our activities turned us into.<p>What's critical is that neither of us were able to understand this until we were able to step back from our passion/obsession and look at it from the outside, as if we were a third party. We had to be able to step apart from our activity, look at ourselves dispassionately, and ask, ""Is this who I want to be?""<p>Now, the situation you describe is a little different. To succeed as an entrepreneur requires constant education, which necessarily includes making many connections with other entrepreneurs for learning and support. Certainly someone who spends all their time consuming music might not be making the most out of their lives, but someone who spends all their time away from their family at tech conferences will also be missing out on very important things. I don't know your personal situation, but I think it does come down to your psychological well-being.<p>Your wealth, your social circle, even your health and your life can vanish in an instant. Whether a recession destroys your 401k, your friends leave you for other interests, you are diagnosed with a disease, or you die in an accident, there is no guarantee that any of these things will continue to persist. That's not to say that they aren't worth laboring for, but recognizing the ephemerality of these things can help give us a new perspective. What I try and ask myself is, ""If I died in the next moment, would I feel that I have lived?""* That question can help me choose between another hour of Diablo 3 and spending some time with my wife, for instance. :)<p>Edit: For the sake of being perfectly honest, my question is a little bit different as it is based on my value system, which I'm not certain the HN community appreciates. I tried to put forth a question that most people could interpret and apply to themselves. But for me, the question is, ""Do I love my God, and do I love my neighbor as Christ demonstrates His love for us, even unto death?"" There are all sorts of ways -- even in soccer and video games! -- that can help me answer this question with a yes. And that's why I think the question of passion vs obsession is a difficult line to draw. To not disclose this would make me feel dishonest, but I admit that I'm reluctant to fully explain this because of the way the tech/scientist community generally feels about religion.",1337777910
4012800,comment,4007229,4012608,1,0,mikegerwitz,,,"> the resulting merge commit will contain a copy of my GPG signature from the git tag.<p>Ah, I see. Thank you for the clarification.<p>It was not overall integrity of the trees that I was bringing into question. While the code review process may be a problem for certain organizations, I am not doubting that process for the kernel. With such a process in place, signed tags are likely to be sufficient, yes.<p>Note, however, that one of the points I was trying to make with the article was proof of authorship (to prevent someone from committing as you, much the same way as you would want to prevent someone from fraudulently sending an e-mail or message through any other means). It is for this reason that the workflow you described is not a complete alternative, but would be an excellent means of augmenting the review process for any project.<p>That said, author identity is not a concern for most projects, in which case, based on the quoted portion of your comment above, my arguments do not necessarily apply (assuming that all commits that are not yet ancestors of a tag <i>are</i> ancestors of a signed merge, as mentioned in your comment).<p>Might I ask how the maintainers deal with issues of identity? If they encounter a commit in your pull request that appears to be from a well-known contributor, do they verify his/her identity before merging, or do they not care?",1337777908

She is very much the Queen because the people and the government allow her to be, whatever the technicalities of the law say.<p>The reality of the situation is that the democratically elected government (sort of, see the House of Lords below) make all the decisions and the Queen merely ""endorses them"" (though even that suggests she has a say in it which she doesn't in any real way).<p>Do the Royal family have influence? Yes they do, but I'd suggest it's really no more than anyone else with that much money has (look at Adrian Beescroft right now) and they're far better than most with that much money in this sense as they're aware that they should remain neutral and do so. Generally the worst that happens is that Prince Charles runs his ill informed mouth about homoeopathy and architecture.<p>It's an odd system and no-one in their right mind would design one like it but as it operates now it's really not that broken.<p>If you want to take a swipe at something can I suggest the unelected House of Lords which has genuine power over the laws of the land and frequently uses it?<p>And even they tend to be a force for good, curbing the worst excesses of successive governments, though I may be more positively inclined towards them than I could otherwise be as I detest the current government so like that the Lords are giving them the run around.",1337777884

That won't be true for that much longer though.<p>The template machinery isn't that horrible.  Certainly not so significant as to seriously impact programmer productivity.  A brace-enclosed initializer list of ints (e.g. { 1, 2, 3, 4 }) is considered a std::initializer_list<int> and this is what a constructor taking such an initializer list looks like:<p><pre><code>  T (std::initializer_list<int> l)
  {
    for (int i : l) {
      // Do something with i (e.g. copy it into the data structure)
    }
  }
</code></pre>
In fact, the C++ designers <i>have</i> created a basic data structure that's defined in the language itself: std::initializer_list.  It's just so minimal that it's only used to initialize more complex, user-defined types.  That way programmers have the benefit of the ""syntactic sugar"" even for data types that the C++ designers never could have envisioned.",1337777598

It works great, but for things like command line stuff which typically runs synchronously, the CPS/callback style of programming gets really messy really fast. Using await/defer (as supported by IcedCoffeeScript) synchronous programming can be done cleanly, if you make sure you write all your own functions in a callback style, and then consistently use await/defer when you want to call them synchronously. Trying to mix the metaphors creates a huge mess; your own functions may be synchronous, but every lib you will be using will be async. Better to keep all functions - including your own - async, and then consistently call them using await/defer when you want sync behaviour.",1337776979

4012661,comment,4009404,4012209,1,0,jkn,,,"Ah good point. Indeed much of what the government does could be accomplished by private groups.<p>So why should the government get involved? Let's look at the case of school meals. Many parents want them but it's not provided by the state school, so parents will team up to make it happen privately. This means negotiating with the school for access to a building on the premises, forming a committee to organize the whole thing (so having elections at periodic intervals to appoint the committee), hiring cooks, cleaners, security, etc., setting up a system for collecting money from parents, and finally establishing a process for decisions such as what to put on the menu.<p>We basically end up with a small task-specific government with its own laws (such as how decisions are made and how people are elected to the committee). So not only is it redundant with other local (e.g. city) governments, it also increases the complexity of everyone's life dramatically, as you have to deal with the public government plus all the private organizations, each with their own quirks.<p>This is why I view politics as a generic platform for debate on societal issues, and government as a framework for taking and implementing decisions. For this to be efficient it is important to have strong local governments at several levels (e.g. city, state, country) and choose wisely their respective prerogatives, such as city level for school meals, state level for school programs and country level for school certification. That does not mean there is no room for private initiatives, it just illustrates why government involvement could be a good option, sometimes.<p>As for the Constitution stuff, there's no question that a government should be monitored carefully and have limited powers (e.g. cannot force children to eat school meals), but this is different from saying it cannot <i>offer</i> school meals.",1337775200

Selling directly to people costs less money, is measurable by how many direct sales were done as a result, allows you to build a personal relationship with the customer, and is easier to do. Plus you can do it yourself.<p>How you approach this depends on what your company does.<p>Also, monitoring Twitter like this is just a waste of time. You will be seen as a spammer. Twitter is a social network. People go there to socialize. Think of it as if you went into a party and started pitching people your products. Not a good idea.
The best you can do in twitter is to try and create a following by posting things that interest them. Then, if by chance, they need something like your product, they might get in contact with you. 
Twitter puts the power on the prospects and not on the marketer. This is why it is a waste of time.<p>Shoot me an email (is in my profile). I may be able to steer you in the right direction.",1337775198

From an interpretation of ""have"" being ""that is implemented and running"", sure, but that's just tautological. It seems easy to conjure up systems where speculation isn't rewarded like this[1]. It just tends to mean no more instant-million or billionaires made out of people who run profitable businesses.<p>Recall that investment was initially about sharing profit in exchange for the funds to grow a business. Part-ownership. But we made those ownable pieces sellable, and people became able to make more money by selling little pieces of companies than by holding onto them and realizing profit; the system has evolved to grease those wheels.<p>If we were collectively prepared to be a little less greedy and insane, the majority of this risk would go away. We don't <i>have</i> to trade speculatively on future expectations of the value of the ability to sell the right to take part in a company's profits. The world could exist without stock markets, and it just means that a lot of smart people might be working on real problems instead of shuffling money. That world would look very similar to ours, except that absurd fortunes may not be come by so easily.<p>[1] Quick ideas: Stock ownership is non-transferable, or Stock-ownership is limited-term, or Stock ownership is limited yield, or Stock ownership is transferable after a fixed period. These could favour the rich and those with knowledge of the system, so perhaps provisions about sales would be required, ""X% made available for individual buyers of less than Y value"" or something. Pretty much any system which removes the notion of a real time market based entirely around selling a company's stock seems to fix the problem. It appears to me that there are a myriad less worse systems, judged by the metric of how many people are injured by the system, and how badly.",1337774827

If I forsake the loyalty card, I don&#x27;t get my privacy back - I just get tracked via another method unless I go out of my way to always carry enough cash to pay anonymously.<p>All the loyalty card does is allow them to track the occasional time I DO pay with cash, which is insignificant enough to be worth the discount. If a store made a genuine, binding offer to only track people with loyalty cards, THEN your question would be a valid comparison. At the moment, it just isn&#x27;t.",1433667518

Amateur athletes aren&#x27;t well compensated, but they are protected from the world of contracts, agents, transfers etc.<p>People give golf or tennis as examples of professional sports where you can struggle as a professional, which is laughable for anyone who knows sports history. These are sports that because of their status has kept a lot of the original characteristics of amateurism in sports (which from the beginning is a status i.e. upper class thing). Countries which have adopted to a modern amateur approach (with government support, non-profit organisations etc) to those sports have also been punching above their weight.<p>So what is huge difference between e-sports and other professional sports? For one they don&#x27;t actually own their sport. I&#x27;m not a huge intellectual property fan, but in the case of professional sports it&#x27;s hugely important. It&#x27;s the basis for most if not all professional sports organisations. Most of e-sports does not make any salary, if they do or even if the don&#x27;t they are signed to a team which takes part winnings in tournaments. So you have a situation where it&#x27;s hard to make a living like in amateur sports, but you don&#x27;t have the support network or limits of the same. At the same time you have to deal with the contracts and incentives from professional sport, but you don&#x27;t get the benefits of intellectual property deals and major leagues and therefor salaries.<p>To some degree this is changing, especially in Korea, but it&#x27;s still more of a business than a sport. Sports at it&#x27;s core is competition to find out who is the best. You do that by having fairly similar conditions over a longer time. That&#x27;s what amateur and professional sport organisations do or, at least, should do.<p>That said I&#x27;m not even sure the discussion should be about if e-sports is a professional or amateur sport, but if it&#x27;s organized enough to be either or for that matter even considered a sport at all. Is chess a sport? How about poker? Or day trading? Fashion modeling?<p>I find myself having a severe lack of motivation while writing this, but hopefully it made some sense.",1433666768

The majority of managers refuse to allocate any time to write any tests. Hell, when we come up with a 6-week estimate for a project, they then tell us we must do it in 4. At 4 weeks, the complaints and blame game begins over why the project isn&#x27;t completed. Why? Because it was a 6 week project, morons.<p>I&#x27;ve only had one company with management that wanted unit tests written for code. Yet there was no official time dedicated to this process. That 6-week project that would be estimated without unit tests? Still 4 weeks. Huh? What magical world do you live in?<p>Quality requires time. That 6 week project now needs 8-9 weeks. Not 4. Not 5. Find me management that understands this and actually cares about quality instead of impossible deadlines that fit their fantasy plan for the current quarter, and we&#x27;ll talk.<p>To be clear, I love writing tests.

I&#x27;d be interested to know what kind of policies there were to control the cache size (will it just expand to fill up Redis / memcached?), as well as how cache TTL is handled.<p>Being able to determine which parameters &quot;matter&quot; is an interesting feature. It doesn&#x27;t immediately seem useful (if the value of the parameter won&#x27;t change the return value of a function, why does it matter?). It&#x27;d be interesting to see some kind of dynamic support for the keys. For example, having a cached value for if parameter `a` is larger than parameter `b`, or for if the first argument of a function is &quot;None&quot;.<p>Great work, and thanks for making it open source!

This allows people to feel confident that they can depend on the service to stay there, and invest in the areas around these transit corridors.<p>Anecdote: I lived in Seattle for 10 years without a car. (A city with surprisingly high transit ridership considering the lack of any sort of rail network, notwithstanding toy trolleys and the lone light-rail line from downtown to the airport.) More than once I moved apartments due to bus routes I relied upon being discontinued or rendered unreliable by drastic service cuts (e.g. instead of all-day service, you now have 4 trips per weekday, peak direction only, and if you miss them you&#x27;re either making two transfers or walking 2 miles to the nearest direct all-day service. Weekend service? hahaha.)<p>This doesn&#x27;t (often) happen with rail, heavy or light. Being unable to depend on bus service in any particular corridor to last more then a year or two without realignment or service cuts made it hard to justify settling down. If I wanted to buy a car and drive everywhere, why pay the premium to live in the city in the first place? In the end, I moved back to a real city where I could depend on the metro.",1433665224

We create XFactory, YFactory, ZFactory for example, with largely the same structure but slightly different logic - then someone takes DRY to the extreme and tries to abstract it away into a FactoryFactory, using reflection or some other tool to get around the host language&#x27;s lack of expressivity.<p>This is where the mess begins, because it becomes so cryptic to figure out how to use the FactoryFactory to create your own Factory to create some other types you need. It may be trivial to people who&#x27;ve been hacking with the same languages and frameworks for years, but the principle of least surprise is abandonded for new users attempting to use a framework for the first time.<p>Functional programming suffers from the same overuse of idioms which are unwelcoming to novices, and often throws away some useful ones in favor of ease of use. FP doesn&#x27;t necessarily dismiss OOP, and it&#x27;s often used in combination with functions to write practical programs.<p>Functional programmers don&#x27;t see OOP as a problem - it&#x27;s a very practical tool. The problem is that it&#x27;s the wrong tool for many problems - particularly if you&#x27;re just computing functions[1]. That a lot of developers are proficient with OOP and see it as a good way to develop programs is part of the cause - they&#x27;re blind to alternative methodologies and shoehorning something into an object where it doesn&#x27;t fit is seen as a being skillful. Also, anything that doesn&#x27;t conform to the language&#x27;s narrow view of &quot;the right way&quot; is considered an anti-pattern.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utilit...</a>",1433664966

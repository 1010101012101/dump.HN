It&#x27;s not clear to me, and it&#x27;s especially not clear when you consider the cost of the drug war.<p>> similarly, black market opiates versus prescription opiates.<p>That&#x27;s because these opiates are illegal, so there&#x27;s very little market pressure (from competition) and also very little recourse against abuses (you can&#x27;t take your drug dealer/manufacturer to court or call the police, which is also why there&#x27;s lots of violence associated with illegal drugs).<p>In these comparisons, you also have to try to consider the cost of drug regulators like the FDA.

6492384,comment,6491144,6492047,10,0,schoen,,,"I agree. In previous discussions about this, some people emphasized the idea of open source development, as opposed to giving an open source software to an end user.  For example, you could run a binary through an obfuscator after compiling in a decryption key -- from source code that had been published and distributed under an open source license.  If the license isn&#x27;t a reciprocal/copyleft license, this is probably not a license violation, but it seems wrong to say that the user who receives the binary is being given open source software.<p>This issue reflects the way that people have had very different ideas about what the point or purpose of free and open source software is (in some ways, reflecting the split between people who preferred to say &quot;free software&quot; over &quot;open source&quot; and vice versa).<p>It&#x27;s also a very concrete issue today in whether people call, say, the Chrome browser &quot;open source&quot;.  Most of their source code is downloadable, derived from the fully open-source Chromium project, but in Google&#x27;s current practice, users never get the complete source code to the Chrome binaries that they run.  If you&#x27;re focused on the development process, it might almost make sense to call Chrome &quot;open source&quot; because almost all of its source code is distributed, licensed, and developed in an open source manner -- but if you&#x27;re focused on what users can do with the software, it&#x27;s obviously just a proprietary application (with a proprietary EULA, to boot).",1380837198

As an interesting example, look at people who play storyline video games to the end, versus ones that stop before finishing. People who are invested (a form of passion) in how the game ends, slog through the boring parts to get there. People who aren&#x27;t invested get turned off by the boring part and stop.

So $86 million for a single state? That number itself is mind-blowingly ridiculous. Allowing that the $86 million came from the $313 million, we&#x27;re still looking at over $200 million to build a software application. I&#x27;m pretty sure the TurboTax guys didn&#x27;t spend that much on their first application -- and they&#x27;re dealing with 50 states plus the federal government&#x27;s tax laws that change every year.<p>I just wonder how many uninsured people in California could have been covered with that $313 million they&#x27;ve spent building a web application that&#x27;s trying to help the uninsured. There are apparently 7 million uninsured in California (the highest number and percentage in the country) so that comes out to about $500 per person. Considering that there will not be a 100% insurance rate in California, it seems like that money spent to build a software application could have covered a pretty high percentage of those uninsured. I&#x27;m obviously simplifying, but it seems like the goal of helping the uninsured took an expensive, wrong turn somewhere. That 313 million doesn&#x27;t include the ongoing salaries and expenses of actually running Covered California. The amount of money spent is staggering considering that not a single dollar of that is actually going to pay any healthcare -- it&#x27;s only a service to help people find insurance.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-california-health-exchange-glitches-20131001,0,7108713.story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-california-he...</a>",1380836726

Remember XHTML and XHTML2? Those, and a bunch of special purpose not particularly interesting niche XML standards (P3P? XML-FO?) were pretty much all they worked on for a decade or so. It wasn&#x27;t until the WHATWG was formed by some browser vendors who wanted to start working on a standard for features that users would actually want, rather than what architecture astronauts thought would be a nice design, and the W3C realized that&#x27;s what people were actually interested in and so replaced XHTML2 with HTML5 based on the WHATWG spec that they actually became relevant again.<p>Now, I will have to give credit that there were still a few groups at the W3C doing work relevant to the actual open web, such as SVG and CSS. But given how the WHATWG took over work on the HTML standard and actually did work towards a standard that was useful and relevant to browser vendors when the W3C went off the rails the last time means that I&#x27;m not too worried if it goes off the rails again this time, you can always form another standards body if it becomes irrelevant.

6492217,comment,6491144,6491839,11,0,AnIrishDuck,,,"> No, the web is all about restricting users. It&#x27;s baked into several HTTP error codes (403 and 401 off the top of my head). SSL is also rather popular.<p>This is obtuse. The HTTP and HTML specs provide standards for interoperation. Some modes of operation are forbidden for some users, and the specification provides a way for that to be communicated. It sounds like you&#x27;re taking a whole-system approach to freedom, which is certainly valid (see the AGPL for a &quot;free&quot; response). But it&#x27;s orthogonal to the issue at hand, which is interoperability. Any client can still implement the specification.<p>That said, I&#x27;m completely at a loss as to how you believe SSL &quot;restricts users&quot;.<p>> I assume you mean that the browser shouldn&#x27;t restrict users? Like, if I stream a movie from Netflix, I should be able to also save it locally so I can take parts of it to use in my fair use arts project?<p>The browser should implement an interoperable standard. That standard should be accessible to everyone. Any browser vendor should be able to, once they have properly implemented the specification, stream a movie from Netflix (this is the very thing that EME makes impossible).<p>> Sorry. Never going to happen. Forcing this use case that _people want_ off into plugins isn&#x27;t going to make anything more &quot;free&quot;.<p>This does not have to be reality, no matter what vendors say. There&#x27;s a reason digital restriction management was forced out of the music space: it&#x27;s ineffective, it&#x27;s consumer-hostile, and it hinders innovation. Many of us are mad precisely because the vendors played hardball in their negotiations, and the W3C wimped out. Vendors need the web more than the web needs the vendors, but the W3C didn&#x27;t take an equally hard line back and we&#x27;re left with a decision that screws everyone but media companies.<p>> That&#x27;s like selling a Roku box that can only play Ted and Youtube videos and saying that it&#x27;s better because it&#x27;s totally free, and open, and doesn&#x27;t restrict its users. Well, sure, that is the best kind of correct. But only because you yanked everything that wasn&#x27;t free. You didn&#x27;t actually add any value over the standard Roku box that plays Netflix and Amazon.<p>The problem is, this decision hinders innovation. It is now much harder for a Roku competitor to exist, because before they can get off the ground they have to comply with byzantine demands of old media companies. &quot;totally free, and open, and doesn&#x27;t restrict its users&quot; is the future of communication and computing (at least technically, politically is a different story). This decision is mired in the past.<p>Let&#x27;s circle back to this:<p>> Forcing this use case that _people want_ off into plugins isn&#x27;t going to make anything more &quot;free&quot;.<p>This is <i>exactly</i> what EME does. The digital restriction management &quot;extensions&quot; are plugins. They are binary blobs, tied to specific hardware implementations. This regresses the web back to the &quot;best viewed on Windows in IE 2.3&quot; days, where interoperation is dead and cross-platform compatibility is a hippy dream.<p>And that&#x27;s why people are mad at the W3C for no longer representing what the web is supposed to be.",1380835709

OSDI 2012 was particularly thorough (my reviews totaled about ~4000 words) I&#x27;m more used to 4-6 reviews, around 3000 words or so. SOSP/OSDI is probably the most thorough and competently run conference that I know of in all of academia. This makes sense: they only take about 30 papers (it&#x27;s restricted not just by quality, but the quality bar goes up as more submissions are made, just to keep it exclusive), it&#x27;s once a year, and systems researchers sync their lives to the OSDI/SOSP submission cycle. It&#x27;s the &quot;flagship&quot; systems conference, and a lot of advances are first described as OSDI/SOSP papers. For some perspective, the original MapReduce paper was by Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, published in OSDI 2004. Last year&#x27;s best paper was the description of the Spanner Distributed Database by Google.<p>Incidentally, I have deanonymized several reviews already. When you go to conferences, and some researcher asks the exact same question and has the exact same opinion as reviewer C, chances are...

And what I&#x27;m learning, very late, is that it can take about that long to understand the true nature of &quot;passion,&quot; and years to develop enough facility, experience and comfort with a particular skill or vocation before you actually understand what it means to be truly at home in something that has become a part of you, probably through years of cycling through thoughts of &quot;this isn&#x27;t my passion.&quot;<p>&quot;Passion,&quot; or the lack of, can be many things. It can be a deep-down intuitive feeling that you simply Don&#x27;t Want To Do This Anymore. It&#x27;s OK to feel that in your early 20s, or 5 months into your first gig. But, my 2c, don&#x27;t give too much credence to it. Real passion happens most often with things that have beaten you down 4 or 5 times and finally have been overcome &#x27;cause you kicked back. &quot;Passion&quot; happens most deeply with something that you love like a hometown, warts and all. Where people know you when you walk across the square, know which parts to avoid, and who has the best coffee. Programming, and really <i>any vocation you chose</i> is like a city. It&#x27;s many things to many people, and rewards best those who practice a discipline of place.<p>So, I&#x27;d say, hold those things in tension: your gut feeling that this may not be for you, over and against the possibility that any new vocation you pursue will present the same roller-coaster of emotion: feelings of incompetence and boredom and futility, followed on by euphoric feelings of revelation, victory and at-homeness.<p>The trick is knowing whether you&#x27;re just on the front end of that cycle, and when your gut is really telling you this isn&#x27;t for you. For that -- talk to friends and coworkers. A lot, over long periods of time. But don&#x27;t <i>just</i> go with a gut feeling.",1380835114

The difference between someone feeling down and someone suffering from depression is stark. Hell it&#x27;s pretty scary.<p>The same thing is true of &quot;burning out&quot;. I&#x27;ve met several developers who have talked about burnout and cited it as a reason they just had to quit their job and backpack around Europe. Fair enough, you were clearly just tired of working and wanted to do something that&#x27;s a bit more fun.<p>Then I met one (and thus far only one) person who truly burned out. That person became, much like someone suffering from depression, a shell of their former self. They became not just unresponsive but completely unable to respond. It was terrifying. They came to work and attempted to function, but they simply couldn&#x27;t. The company simply rode them to the point that their brain seemed to turn off.<p>When you see it, you know it. That guy wasn&#x27;t rationalizing anything. He had simply been pushed too hard for too long for his mind to keep up.<p>The company in question was from a VERY high-profile accelerator (not naming names!).

You are spending 1-5 years on a lottery ticket, when you could be buying an annuity with it instead.<p>The VC/incubator crowd, inciting young people who don&#x27;t know how much 5 years out of your 20s is worth, to spend it making a bad bet that the VC ultimately wins.<p>(Your 20s set the tone for your future career, your first paycheck sets the subsequent ones, and they are the best time to find a good life partner.)<p>Once a startup gets funding, and pays the founders 100k a year, they are on the good side of the bet. There is an invisible mass of unfunded quit and bootstrap attempts out there, or people at minor incubators eating noodles and living for 3 years in a shared one room flat. Those are the guys that lost the bet.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s just my view as an outside observer. Maybe it is wildly wrong.",1380834102

Seems like adding non-seamless adds for this platform is not the best way to utilize the product they have.  In my opinion, they should be driving more seamless integration with their apps that do generate revenue and use this as a property to prop those up.  That&#x27;s really why they bought this thing, to keep mobile pictures in Facebook&#x27;s realm.  They should drive more integration towards that goal.  They certainly did not buy it because they thought it would generate revenue and profit eventually to provide a good return on the invested capital, so why try to utilize it like that?",1380834079

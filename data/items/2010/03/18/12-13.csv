You can't patent a concept.<p>This would be clearer if patent titles were prefixed with ""A"", as in ""A method..."", etc. Most people seem to read them as ""The method..."", which when combined with the linear format (even though claims are dependent), makes almost all of them sound much more broad than they actually are.<p>You might might get a better idea of what the patent is intended to cover by noting the <i>differences</i> between implementations, rather than the similarities. I won't speak to that myself, as I have never seen the Windows Mobile implementation.",1268917007

1201100,comment,1200909,1200909,0,0,loginx,,,"I'd like to point out that Android suffers from much more fragmentation than is apparent to the casual US-based reader, in that international versions of Android themselves are also fragmented.<p>For example, Google Navigation is still only available in the US, and if you are living in Canada, although the language and driving conventions are the same and all the map data is already available, Google Navigation launches only to tell you that it won't run in Canada.<p>Additionally, for the first year, paid market apps were not available in Canada. Our version of Market didn't even have a paid section at all. As of this week, they're starting to add it, but this section of the market is absolutely empty.<p>I don't buy for a minute that this has anything to do with the complexity involved making transactions in Canada, since Google checkout is the payment backend and it's worked in canada for about 5 years. Also, I installed MarketEnabled on my phone to pretend I was on T-Mobile, and was able to access paid apps and purchase them just fine with my Canadian bank info.<p>The real fragmentation I see Android suffering from is that it is at the mercy of:\n1) A totally heterogenous set of carriers that each want the OS to work in a certain way. (Rogers refuses to ship a 1.6 upgrade to the OS)\n2) A totally heterogenous set of manufacturers that each want to differenciate their handsets through the OS (HTC Sense UI, Motorola Blurr UI, Android stock UI, I'm guessing the sony X10 will have its own too).<p>And I perceive google as constantly bending over to the strange conditions imposed by carriers and manufacturers, constantly having to do extra work to compensate because they're losing more and more control of the platform.<p>I also perceive the Nexus one as an attempt to get out of this mess by re-gaining leverage over the carriers, and I think each Android handset sold makes their platform more relevant, hopefully providing them with more leverage also, but in the short term future, the fragmentation will only become increasingly complex.",1268915914

Every time I release a new version of the software I send them an image of the CD, and every time I sell a CD a service I use called e-junkie (which wraps Paypal's and Google's transaction notification API on my behalf) pings them to actually ship the CD out.  I get billed later in the month.  Costs about $5 ~ $6 a CD, or $150 a month.<p>Content creation: I've talked on HN many times about how my core SEO strategy is publishing 800 (as of today) sets of bingo activities through my website.  About 780 of those were written by freelancers, using (most recently) a customized CMS written in Rails.  Costs about $3.33 an activity.<p>Wordpress themes: One of my other SEO strategies, for activities I feel are likely to have tens of thousands of searchers (mostly holiday-oriented bingo), is to create mini-sites on Wordpress which serve as very, very focused landing pages for my product.  I typically try to give them a laser-focused design.  Most of my existing ones are from OSS designers, one is from a designer I know in town (hiya, Keith!), and one is from the gentleman who posted on HN recently about needing to make $400 a month.<p>Content for mini-sites: So while I theoretically could crank out similar-sounding minisite content on Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving ... I have better things to do with my very limited free time, so I pay people to do this for me.  (Runs about $100 a site for 5 pages.  I tend to overpay.)<p>Buttons: I'm passionate about A/B testing button designs and have all the image manipulation skills of a drunken squirrel.  Most of the time I get people to make my images for me.  I've actually got a few dozen in the pipeline right now for some A/B testing starting right after I go full-time.<p>General HTML design: I don't do consequential tweaks to HTML that commonly, but when I do, I typically get them done for me.  As soon as my designer and I mutually have a day free we need to work on my signup pages and landing pages again.<p>That's all I can think of off the top of my head.

1201093,comment,1200844,1200966,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>Read the news much?</i><p>Are you trying to insult me for asking you to be more specific? I'm sorry if I offended you, but I did not think it was an unreasonable question.<p><i>Apple's been doing this all over the place.</i><p>I'm sure you would agree that ""all over the place"" is not very specific, just as ""getting out of hand"" is. I'm asking what exactly you mean by this, not trying to debate you on points that you haven't even made.<p><i>DOPi</i><p>That's was a trademark case. The HTC suit is patent case. Trademarks have very different rules than patents, most relevant among them they can be lost if not enforced by the owner.<p>Surely you realize that ""DOPi"" does not simply have an ""i"" in the name, but is in fact ""iPOD"" in reverse. I am not a lawyer, but I don't think it's entirely ""out of hand"" for that to be the basis of a trademark infringement claim, especially in the context of <i>iPod</i> accessories. Perhaps not as clear-cut as something like ""iPob"" or ""iDop"" or ""Apel"", but not frivolous, either. It certainly isn't, as you characterize it, a case against the use of the letter ""i"" (which Apple does not hold a trademark on), and indeed there are many companies that use prefixed ""i"" in names without such claims being made on them.<p>Again: Apple could literally lose the ""iPod"" trademark if it could be shown they were too lax in asserting it. It is obvious where the name came from, but not obvious that it is infringing. Hence, filing a trademark infringement claim and letting the court decide. This seems reasonable to me.<p>To come full circle: this is why I ask people to be specific. Now that I know what you were referring to as ""out of hand"", I know that I disagree with you and have the opportunity to explain why. Before, it was unclear, which makes it difficult to have an intelligent discussion. Had I commented on the patent situation right off, without asking for clarification, we would simply be talking past each other, with little chance for insight.",1268915699

They were enslaved.<p>Hitler and Nazi Germany installed a system to get these people and to bring them to the concentration camps.<p>Hitler also was not more unpopular after Germany lost the war. It took two generations to get rid of that. Children or grand children who questioned the doings and motives of their fathers and grand fathers. It took a lot of discussions, research, documentation to understand what happened and why. This understanding did not happen over night and not because Hitler won the war. But because people found out that there were millions of dead people, there were jews that were missing, where were they? The children asked their parents and they were not satisfied with the answers. What did the German army do in Russia? Research was needed to go to the truth and it was ugly.<p>Again: Hitler did not want to win some war and some partial victory.<p>He was talking about the 'Endsieg': the final victory.<p>You are making an assumption that is not in line with Hitler's goals. He would not have been satisfied with anything less then the Endsieg. Hitler was no rational politician - he was a racist and mass murderer.<p>There is also nothing positive to say about Stalin and all the other criminals from the past. That there were more like Hitler does not make him 'relatively bad'. He was bad. Period.<p>'What if Hitler did this or that?' is plain wrong if you don't understand his motives, his deep hate of other 'unworthy' races, etc. A compromise - that would be either tactics (like history shows his compromises were) or not Hitler.",1268914816

1201053,comment,1200724,1200862,0,0,barrkel,,,"Not specific to your issue, but rather to the use of closures where OO folks would use objects.<p>The thing is, a lot of the time you need sideband data. A simple closure isn't always enough. Perhaps you need configuration options, or you need names for diagnostics, or you need to monitor throughput statistics, etc. A closure is a clumsy interface when it's overloaded to do multiple things. You end up with some kind of variadic argument list and having to switch on the first or more arguments - you basically end up writing a method dispatch routine.<p>So in this specific example, I would suggest that using a closure may turn out to be the wrong choice longer-term. I'd probably prefer a base class with a virtual method, and a concrete descendant which delegated the action to a closure. That way you get the succinctness of a closure when that's sufficient, but you also get the future proofness that a base class provides - you can add more functionality in the future, but without breaking previously defined implementations.",1268914282

3949986,comment,3948896,3948896,1,0,byoung2,,,"I think online education is under-utilizing the scale of the internet for course creation.  With Stanford, Harvard, and MIT putting classes online, you just have a handful of professors giving lectures to a much bigger audience.  But there are millions of professors around the world, and if just the top 1% all put their courses online, we'd have more styles of presenting the same material so students could pick the one that suits them.  Imagine being able to take that game theory course but choose a Stanford professor, or a professor from a small college in the Midwest, or a superstar from IIT in India.  Or being able to select a professor with a more academic tone, or a comedic tone, or one who uses sports analogies.  This is where I think the real power of online learning is.",1336589986

Yes, but if patent trolls have to operate furtively, not telling anyone what they do, on pain of being denied service in many places, the world is a better place.  Make the world a better place.<p>I don't see why you are obligated to lend a helping hand to evil that happens to be legal.  I'm not saying to throw a punch at someone doing something legal that you don't like; I'm saying that you are not obligated ethically or morally to do business with them.

""Justifiable"" to?<p>You are, as was said by the sheriff played by Roy Schieder In Jaws ""the Chief of Police"". And you're not a large corporation (yet) where you have to issue a memo which says ""don't sell to patent trolls "" either.<p>You can do whatever you want to deflect or keep any business and nobody needs to know about it. You can simply be passive aggressive with any customer. You don't return phone calls. You don't setup demo dates. You don't get back to them without pricing or details or answers to questions they have. Almost everyone will leave and just think you are a typical non-responsive business and they will go elsewhere. Or you can quote them a high price to scare them away. There are dozens of ""not in the book"" ways you can get people to not give you business. Bad service is only one. It's not that hard. And you don't have to announce it to the world or justify it to anyone. It's done quietly.<p>This happens everyday in business for many reasons (that don't even have to do with anything objectionable). A salesman will spend his time with someone who is going to give him more business and be lackadaisical with someone that appears to be a trifler. Lawyers will build their business with any client then they will thin those clients by being less responsive and/or jacking up billing rates. The clients leave. They don't announce ""you are not important anymore"". It just happens.<p>Added: ""jeopardizing our trustworthiness with our real customers""<p>The point is to do it where the other customers don't know you are doing this.

It's a good thing for everybody actually.<p>Now as for Facebook's valuations, the question is - will Facebook bring as much traffic to applications in the future than Google did to commerce websites. My belief is yes (look at Viddy, SocialCam, Zynga, Pinterest, Draw Something if you need examples). In that case, Facebook, like Google in 2004-2008, will grow into a 100B-$200 valuation (which does not mean that I think it is the best stock purchase to do, the big money on Facebook has been made already by earlier investors).

3949868,comment,3949537,3949537,6,0,jarrett,,,"A lot of this discussion seems to boil down to several key issues:<p>1. Should you ever refuse service to someone because you disapprove of their lawful activities?\n2. If so, where do you draw the line?\n3. If so, how do you deal with the fact that you can only enforce the policy when a customer's activities are specifically brought to your attention?<p>To answer #1, I'd make an analogy to the social responsibility rules some companies voluntarily impose on themselves. (Some companies say they will only buy from vendors who meet certain fair labor standards. Others say they will only buy from environmentally friendly vendors. Et cetera.)<p>Refusing service based on an ethical principle is very similar to these types of policies, except you're declining to sell something instead of buy. Companies that follow these rules are generally lauded for it. Likewise, companies that are perceived as <i>not</i> doing so are criticized. (Think of Apple's relationship with Foxconn.)<p>So I think it's pretty safe from a P.R. standpoint to refuse service based on ethical principles. You might have to ditch a handful of paying customers, but if your business model is about volume, it's probably not going to matter.<p>As for the ethical imlications of refusing service, I say that nobody is entitled to use your service any more than you're entitled to customers. So I don't see a problem there.<p>Question #2 is harder. Where do you draw the line? I'd say that's up to each company to decide, but here are some reasonable examples of things you might forbid:<p>- Patent trolls<p>- Hate groups<p>- Technically lawful but sleezy stuff, e.g. certain infoproducts<p>The exact list a company chooses would of course depend on the subjective ethical beliefs of its leadership. Which is fine--it's their company. In any case, it's very important to clearly state these rules in the TOS. You really don't want to be seen as capricious, and it's not fair to your customers, even the evil ones.<p>Question #3 is probably the hardest. As the OP pointed out, you can't just dig through your customers' data, looking for possible violations. So you'd have to wait until something was brought to your attention. And then, as the OP said, you'd have de facto tolerance for offenders who don't speak up. Which seems kind of unfair.<p>But here, I'd make an analogy to the TOS rules concerning criminal activity. There must be tons of people using legitimate web services for crime. Occassionally, some of these are discovered, and their accounts are terminated. The rest get away with it.<p>I doubt anyone would say you should ignore reports of criminal activity just because some other crime goes unreported.

As a customer, that kind of action on your part would <i>definitely</i> make me think twice before signing up. Even though I'm not a patent troll, what if you some day decided that what I was using it for was also unacceptable? Speaking of the letter of the law, the ToS that you <i>both</i> agreed to didn't mention anything about patent trolling being out of bounds.<p>What I would do in future is maintain a list of un-OK uses as a schedule to the ToS, but grandfather existing clients into the old ToS (perhaps with a 30 day grace period, allowing customers to export all of their data). In the case of customers using the software to do things you don't like, rather than terminate their account, just politely ask them to take their custom elsewhere (with no obligation to do so).

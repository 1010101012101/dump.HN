With Silicon Valley, <i>leading edge</i> has no connection with peer-reviewed original research!<p>So, do a startup.  Web development?  Taught myself -- the Web page code works fine.  The difficulty was a lot of poorly written documentaiton.  The software was fast, fun, and easy.<p>&quot;Leading edge&quot;?  Yup -- my startup is based on some original applied math I derived, complete with theorems and proofs.  Likely and apparently I&#x27;m the only person in the world who understands that work.    Definitely <i>leading</i>.<p>The problem my work solves, a lot of people have regarded as important.  So far, I have the only good solution.  Some of the people trying to solve the problem say that the solution I have is impossible -- they didn&#x27;t understand what the heck they were talking about.  They couldn&#x27;t come up with a counterexample why not or a theorem of why can.  The people just were not very good.<p>Problem is, really, <i>leading</i> is not what Silicon Valley is looking for.  They wouldn&#x27;t know the real stuff about <i>leading</i> if it slapped them in the face.  My best published papers, nearly no one in Silicon Valley has\nthe prerequisites to read, and likely no one outside of Stanford or Berkeley and only a few people there.<p>Instead of <i>leading</i>, they want two years of experience in just what the heck low grade, routine, simple minded, poorly documented API or OSS they are struggling with today.<p>Those people are being self-taught on their way to the <i>leading edge</i> and are floundering around and stand\nnot to get to the <i>leading edge</i>.  E.g., they keep saying <i>Bayesian</i> and <i>power law</i> but don&#x27;t know the difference between the weak and strong laws of large numbers or about conditional expectation, non-parametric hypothesis tests, the Radon-Nikodym theorem, anything about martingales, the Neyman-Pearson lemma, etc., enough about conditioning even to understand the definition of a Markov process, a basic result such as<p>E[E[Y|X]] = E[Y]<p>the role of sigma algebras,\nor any such things.<p>Early in my career, I started in computing and started to get self-taught in the often associated applied math.  I made good progress in some things but otherwise floundered around with low quality materials, etc.<p>Then I went for a good Ph.D. and got one.  Now I can say, nearly no one in Silicon Valley startups is in any significant sense even near the <i>leading edge</i> and, instead, they are just floundering around.<p>Back to my startup -- a few good days and I should be able to go live.",1447130437

Create a tmpfs, create the necessary directory tree inside it, bind-mount each whitelisted path in the tmpfs to the real file, then pivot_root into the tmpfs. This sounds complicated but is actually not very much code, and again a library could make it easier.<p>But I think you could also do it with pure seccomp. The trick is to copy the filename list into memory pages that you subsequently mark read-only. Then, have your seccomp filter whitelist specifically pointers to those strings, and prohibit making the pages writable again.<p>(Disclaimer: I just came up with this on a whim, it probably needs more thought.)",1447130162

Every single company that I sent my resume to contacted me and I got through the phone screens on all but 1. That company sent a frontend developer just out of college to interview me, but I&#x27;m pure backend and didn&#x27;t know too many frontend concepts, which flummoxed the interviewer. He basically had no idea how to interview me and gave up.<p>Of the companies I went onsite to, half of them gave me offers. The others didn&#x27;t, but not because of ageism but because my interview performance wasn&#x27;t as strong as I hoped (asking questions in areas I wasn&#x27;t prepared for, lack of expertise in their desired programming lang, screwed up the coding question, etc). All of the offers I received were an increase from my current job.<p>Overall I would say that ageism doesn&#x27;t exist. Employers want people that can contribute quickly without a lot of handholding and without training. This applies whether or not you are a fresh grad or a veteran programmer. If you instill confidence that you are highly qualified to the interviewer, you will generally get the job.<p>And as someone who has been intimately involved in the hiring process as a hiring manager, I can say the same thing. I&#x27;ve interviewed people of a variety of ages and the only takeaway I care about is will they hit the ground running and contribute to the team quickly. That&#x27;s why software developers are highly paid. When I first started working, IBM would give aptitude tests completely unrelated to programming, and if you did well, you would get a job and be trained.<p>Unfortunately those days don&#x27;t exist anymore, for the most part. It&#x27;s a problem caused strictly because of how highly paid engineers are. If salaries were 50-60k, then I&#x27;m pretty sure companies would be more apt to training and waiting for new people to get on board. But salaries are easily 3X that in the Valley, so at that price, you need to be contributing very quickly otherwise you&#x27;re a waste of money.",1447130079

We mostly seek out things that validate the way we already feel inside, not go, &quot;I&#x27;m feeling pretty crappy today, let me go watch some cat vids to cheer me up.&quot; If something comes along that doesn&#x27;t feed into our current state, we tend to ignore it.<p>We had the Internet for a lot longer than we&#x27;ve had cat videos. It wasn&#x27;t that we couldn&#x27;t have had them or that none existed, they just weren&#x27;t all that popular. There was a definite turn in the 2000s where people, and the Internet, suddenly got a lot happier.<p>My theory is that Internetting before Facebook was mostly a solitary thing that loners would do to get away from lives they otherwise hated. With Facebook the masses came, and so everyone all of a sudden had to cater to a wider audience. People who really do want to get away from humanity have their 4chans, but they&#x27;re in the minority now. Reddit would have been a very different place in the late nineties.",1447128730

Most of the world has no such opportunity. They spend long hours for even the chance to put food on the table, with no internet access or modern luxuries that we have! They would give so much even for access to that. Meanwhile, it seems most Americans feel entitled to not only their high standard of living but a relaxed (in comparison) work environment and scheduling freedom.<p>Perhaps the answer is that we all need to adjust to the reality that such freedoms only come with hard work, good planning, and some luck. It seems to be the reality that most of the world has already dealt with.",1447128651

10537562,comment,10535235,10536893,0,0,bzbarsky,,,"A few notes on that implementation, since I have some firsthand experience with both the implementation and its removal:<p>1)  &quot;For addons only&quot; is an important qualification.  It means you don&#x27;t have to worry about sandboxing at all, since addons are already all-powerful (or at least were at the time).<p>2)  It added a _lot_ of complexity throughout the DOM.  There are tons of places in the web platform that basically assume you have a &quot;JS value&quot; and things fall apart if that&#x27;s not the case.  Most simply, what happens if python code sets document.body.onclick and then JS code reads it, or vice versa?  It&#x27;s possible that this complexity and the resulting performance impact is worth carrying around if the use cases are compelling enough, but they just weren&#x27;t.<p>3)  The python implementation in question did not have a good solution for the problem of cross-language cycles.  Those were solved for JS and C++ in Firefox by creating a cycle collector that tightly integrates with the JS GC and the refcounting system the C++ side uses.  But that was only possible due to full control over the JS GC implementation (and hence the ability to change it to flag objects as &quot;only owned by C++ stuff&quot; and whatnot).  Doing the same thing with Python would be a nontrivial undertaking, just for the C++ and Python bits.  Dealing with cycles that involve all three languages would be _quite_ hard.",1447128318

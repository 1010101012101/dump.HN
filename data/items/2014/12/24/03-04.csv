That project started briefly in Research but was shepherded to product pretty quickly.<p>Shumway is a separate project but similar in spirit. It&#x27;s not a converter per se, but rather an emulator including a full ActionScript Bytecode (ABC) JIT, implemented in pure JavaScript. Right now we are interested in getting Shumway to the point where it can be used in Firefox as an alternative to the native Flash plugin for certain kinds of web Flash content, to provide better security, stability, and performance. Over time as Shumway matures the ultimate goal would be to eliminate the need for the Flash plugin entirely, but we&#x27;ll walk before we run.<p>But Shumway is usable as a standalone project as well, and others have begun taking notice. For example, Prezi has invested in Shumway as a library for rendering vector graphics:<p><a href=""https://medium.com/prezi-engineering/how-and-why-prezi-turned-to-javascript-56e0ca57d135"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/prezi-engineering/how-and-why-prezi-turne...</a>",1419393537

Everybody see Node.JS (javascript) as somesort of web dev language in the same vein as Ruby, Python and PHP. But the web frameworks out there that I&#x27;ve seen are mostly incomplete or just very bare bones compare to RoR, Django, and Laravel. Express is very very barebone and you wouldn&#x27;t prototype with that or do anything quick with that. You can argue that would use Node.JS for long term stuff and my counter point would be if your code have to survive for more than 6 months then use a type language. I don&#x27;t believe a dynamically loose type language such as Javascript is suitable. Go would be better in this regard.<p>I&#x27;d like to see Rust vs Ada vs C++",1419393365

It&#x27;s quite important to understand what rights people have when they start asserting rights.\nFor instance, a bead maker claiming that they have a &#x27;copyright&#x27; on a certain style of glass bead which they seem to think involves a combination of the name, process and result.

The monopoly is there to allow inventors to profit and so to continue to develop and invent. The monopoly is initially exchanged for the explicit disclosure of the invention. Without this deal the public domain would remain sparse as in order to profit (or really &#x27;in order to break even&#x27; in many fields of endeavour) inventors would otherwise tend to choose to keep their inventions secret and deprive the public domain of the knowledge of how the invention is worked.<p>Now, of course the development cycle of almost all patentable things has shortened with increased technology and industrialisation. So patent terms in many areas are probably a bit too long as well. But patents protection can realistically be an order of magnitude shorter term than some current copyrights will prove to be, and certainly with no less work put in to the creation.",1419392479

8791440,comment,8791401,8791401,0,0,pedalpete,,,"I have a very different perspective than the author.<p>I&#x27;ve considered Libraries to be the pieces of code that let us &#x27;paper over browser inconsistencies&#x27; to be things like jQuery. Sure, they also gave us some useful tools and plugins to accomplish tasks, but on the core purpose was to be able to write simple javascript code for common functions and have parity across all the major browsers.<p>Frameworks, I view at as code organization and paradigm tools. They create a more consistent structure for a group of developers to work on a single project. It aids in creating an MV* or other similar paradigm that a team can work within. Even outside of a team environment, Frameworks give you a ... framework, of how your app should be built, rather than just creating your own structure as you go along.<p>This is the reason why there are so many frameworks vs. libraries. Once you&#x27;ve chosen a library to handle browser inconsistency, as the author mentioned, barely an issue anymore, there is an endless possibility as to how your app should be structured. Some people like two-way data binding, some don&#x27;t. Some people need extreme DOM performance of leveraging the virtual DOM, others hate the idea of having their html closely bound to their javascript (and framework as often the case).",1419392407

8791437,comment,8789259,8789833,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"> Ask me which I&#x27;d trust more: a website that stores passwords using whatever hash a PHP developer came up with, or a website that implemented some kind of PAKE, like SRP, to authenticate passwords.<p>If you&#x27;re asking that question you don&#x27;t understand the purpose of SRP or ZKPP. If you&#x27;re giving a password you use elsewhere to a website, you&#x27;re trusting them with your private data, and you shouldn&#x27;t. As developers it&#x27;s our jobs to prevent users from making this mistake if we can.<p>When using SRP or another ZKPP scheme, trust doesn&#x27;t enter the equation. You aren&#x27;t giving the server your password, you&#x27;re giving them a piece of data which is verifiably difficult to reverse to obtain your password, so you don&#x27;t need to trust them to store it properly.<p>> What&#x27;s especially ironic about your comment is that password-authenticated key exchanges still require servers to store authenticators which can be attacked offline.<p>This isn&#x27;t ironic: this is exactly what I would expect from kerkelsager&#x27;s comment. Again you&#x27;re just showing your ignorance. Yes, you can attack an authenticator. The point of ZKPP is that it allows the client to verify that such an attack is computationally difficult. If you&#x27;ve given the server your password in plain text (or reversibly encrypted form), you can no longer verify that obtaining the password from the authenticator is computationally difficult. For all you know, the server stores your password in plain text. This isn&#x27;t a theoretical problem: there are numerous examples of this happening.<p>> PAKEs actually make the problem we&#x27;re talking about harder, not easier, because the authenticator format has to be compatible with the protocol.<p>If you&#x27;re objecting to implementing things correctly because it&#x27;s hard, software might not be the right career for you.",1419392366

But, I think the issues are surmountable.<p>For example the case of presenting drafts to publishers could be considered to be a certain class of limited disclosure and the works could be treated as still private and non-public. Then a similar system to patents could be used whereby the publication, the [licensed and purposive] presentation of matter to the public domain, would be the key date.<p>Such a copyright system would focus on the protection of business interests of producers (i.e. authors, etc.).<p>In parallel I would maintain moral rights on a similar basis to the current copyright terms. They would start at production, last for life + some-years, and cover at least the right to be named as author of your own works and other similar rights that prevent libellous edits being issued and such.<p>To pay for the system one could use the Statute of Anne&#x27;s model of requiring payment for a second equal term. I like the 14+14 model; it still favours the author strongly IMO but allows works to enter the public domain when they are still culturally significant (to allow their effect on cultural development to be maximised). A 28 year term isn&#x27;t quite a full career and so there is less sense that we&#x27;re dissuading &#x27;artists&#x27; from continued production.<p>Under my formulation the statute would not protect works that could not fully enter the public domain, those with DRM say. To allow companies to use DRM they would need to submit a free-libre copy of their work which could then be released when the term expires (or put keys on deposit that could decrypt the works, or what have you). Copyright is a bargain with the people, rights holders need to uphold their end of that bargain too.<p>There&#x27;s much more that I could flesh out, but I doubt anyone would read it here ...",1419391853

8791394,comment,8790629,8791334,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;It doesn&#x27;t check any of the scripting language boxes I&#x27;ve ever heard of.&quot;<p>Well, as I sort of implied but will now spell out, the 1990s produced a certain stereotypical definition of a &quot;scripting language&quot; that I think is ultimately overspecified. A 1990s scripting language is <i>extremely</i> dynamic, including the type system, everything&#x27;s boxed, everything&#x27;s a hash table of one form or another, and in general everything converges to produce a language that is very fluid, but ultimately very slow. These were overreactions to the languages of the day, which were, I think, easy to forget how hard they were to use in practice. Even when you use C or C++ today, you&#x27;re still using it with radically better community best practices, libraries, and better tool support. 1990s C++ was some hard stuff to work with even before you let threading in. Into that world, Perl and Python were a breath of fresh air!<p>It is easy to get deceived by the constant stream of benchmarks that are 50% faster than last month and the constant stream of incredibly-micro micro-benchmarks where JS or something is as fast as C at adding together small integers in an array or something. The reality is that after years and years and years of work, they&#x27;re fundamentally slow. Yes, even Javascript; remember, for asm.js to produce such fantastic speedups, Javascript must be leaving that much performance on the table.<p>Go ends up in practice working very like a scripting language; line counts are virtually identical in my experience, logic is very similar, and the fluidity is there, partially by virtue of ignoring the very things that Rust brings out and makes explicit (the ownership and such). I can&#x27;t say with a straight face that the logic comes out the <i>same</i>, the way a Perl program can be virtually transliterated into Python, because the ability to use concurrency seriously means that you don&#x27;t have to bend into the contortions you sometimes do to simulate it in those older languages, but otherwise it works similarly, except that you use structs and interfaces instead.<p>Scripting 1.0, being made when this world was younger and 150MHz was a fast machine, made some mistakes in thinking that compilers would eventually be able to overcome their fundamental weaknesses. It was a neat experiment to make everything wildly dynamic, but in the end, you end up paying and paying and paying and paying and paying for that dynamism, but you only use it rarely. You may be inclined to object, saying &quot;I use it all the time! I use Ruby gems to assemble all sorts of complicated and interesting objects!&quot;, but that&#x27;s because we humans are really bad at order of magnitudes inside of programs... you set up your objects essentially once at the &quot;beginning&quot; of some computation, then you pay for that dynamism <i>billions of times</i>. You pay for the awesome exception handling all the time, yet only use it rarely. You pay... etc.<p>Scripting 1.0 also accidentally interpreted the failures of the languages of the day, which were all statically typed, as being significantly caused by static typing. I&#x27;d suggest we&#x27;ve since learned that the static typing of the time was simply bad; the languages are not all that great, and the ways they were used even worse (inheritance favored over composition, etc.). So they whiplashed wildly to the opposite, which turns out to have been an overreaction similar to the previous paragraphs. You pay for all that typing dynamism all the time, yet in practice, legal inputs to a given function are characterized by a limited number of types, legal outputs also, and all this dynamism is really going to waste. (Go&#x27;s interfaces capture %95 of the use cases here while still being perfectly statically typed. There are other possibilities as well for other languages to explore.)<p>Scripting 2.0 is fixing that problem by creating languages that judiciously use dynamism instead of indiscriminately slathering it everywhere, that are merely <i>somewhat</i> slower than C rather than the night-and-day of 1.0, are still fairly easy to program in even if they are not as wildly dynamic, and execute an order of magnitude faster than Python or Perl or JS while also obtaining the advantages of more static typing for software quality. Go is merely the most prominent of this line of language, there&#x27;s a whole bunch of them bubbling up right now. Julia is trying to fit into this for numeric computing, LuaJIT is sitting there sipping the punch wondering why all the other languages are so many years late to the party, there&#x27;s another language that&#x27;s popped up on HN every so often in the past few months that fits in here but escapes my mind, and I think we&#x27;re going to see more of this. With computer processors speeds having stalled it becomes a difficult proposition to go up to a programmer and promise them the moon, and all they have to do is be willing to be 20-100x slower than the competition, and, uh, well, no, you won&#x27;t just catch up in 5 years of processor advancement because raw clock speeds are stalled.<p>So I find in practice Go is a Scripting 2.0 language. You write it at roughly Python speeds, it runs much faster and works much better in the cloud where that actually matters, and part of the way it accomplishes this is to do things like gloss over memory management details and exactly how interfaces are satisfied (dynamic lookup at runtime, compare with wycat&#x27;s comments in the thread on how Rust does it), and generally focuses on being relatively easy and fast to write. Looking at it from another direction, compare Go to Rust and Go looks more like a scripting language than a competitor to Rust.<p>I could write a similar post on how Rust is also a harbinger of a new wave of languages that are trying to replace C++, but make it easier to write correct code than to write incorrect code. (C++, alas, makes both quite easy, and makes it hard to tell which is which. It is true that correct code is possible, but it takes more skill to get there than it should.) Nim, for instance, fits into this mold, though a great deal less popular. I expect more. The dependent type community is also struggling mightily in the direction of putting this sort of thing out, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see something moderately practical pop out in about 5 years or so.<p>I know the narrative right now is that Rust and Go are in some sort of fierce competition, but personally I see a world where they live in harmony, with a great deal less overlap than most people currently see, just as Python would still not displace C even if it were in fact 25 times faster.<p>It&#x27;s really quite an exciting time and I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on these languages. I am <i>ready</i> to leave C and C++ behind. Of course I&#x27;ve already got Go in hand, but I look forward to Rust. (As I am personally a &quot;cutting edge&quot; but not a &quot;bleeding edge&quot; sort of guy in language choice, Rust and I are not yet a match. I consider this just a matter of time.)<p>All just my opinion, of course. I am not the keeper of the term &quot;scripting language.&quot; YMMV.",1419390975

It then can immediately flush this buffer to the server as a new synchronization request. This reuses the exact same logic as any other transform, so it adds almost no code to the client.<p>As for the limitation that OT only supports inserts and deletes: OT supports anything that can be transformed. If you build an operation &quot;indent area&quot; and then provide a way to partially order that operation against all the other operations (such as &quot;range operation, sort by first position, reverse second, and break ties by operation&quot;) you can transform it by moving the position boundaries for inserts and deletes, and when it applies and itself creates a ton of spaces in its interior, that is how it transforms the rest of the operations in the queue.

So, if Alice transmits at 60fps, a temporally-smart coding will allow a switch between Alice and Bob to drop some frames so Bob only gets 30fps, say, while Charlie gets the full 60fps. This is useful if Alice has a wonderful upstream connection and Charlie has a great downstream connection, but Bob is connecting via a crappy mobile connection.<p>Spatial SVC is the same thing, but cast in terms of resolution. Imagine that Alice is transmitting 1080p, and Bob is still on that bad mobile network. An SVC coding would mean that Alice could transmit a single high-res stream, and a smart media switch could send Bob a &quot;down-sampled&quot; 380p stream without having to decode and re-encode, while still sending the full 1080p to Charlie.<p>So. Clearly, this is awesome when dealing with real-time coding (e.g., video calling). But when streaming content from Netflix or Youtube or whatever, it&#x27;s trivial to provide different streams at different resolutions to different users, based on prevailing network conditions for each user. The up-front cost of encoding and storing a dozen so different versions of the same content is minimal, and the work to identify the right stream for each user is about the same in either case.",1419390489

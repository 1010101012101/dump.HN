Happy to see this as a conclusion:<p><i>They are trying to shift attention away from what the U.S. government has done onto what the people who have reported it have done.</i><p>Seriously. It would be like if someone trespassing on OJ Simpson&#x27;s property caught video of OJ harming people with a knife and then the public focusing on how terrible of a person the trespasser is, ignoring the fact that it&#x27;s incredible video evidence of a much more serious crime. Further, it would be as though the trespasser only trespassed in the first place because he heard loud screams from the property.<p>In other words, Snowden&#x27;s a whistleblower, but I think the media and gov&#x27;t have succeeded in ruining the term &#x27;whistleblower&#x27;. Whistleblowers almost by definition have to violate certain laws, but our protection laws were supposed to make that ok.

This should be so easy now that you see it - essentially drag and drop albeit with text commands - it should have almost no pedagogical value (if you built a model in Lego then it would literally be child&#x27;s play). Yet even having identified what I needed to move and where I wanted to move it, the challenge remained - what is the weirdly named command I must type to make that (and only that) happen? Which way round are the arguments again? (eg. &#x27;git rebase&#x27;, to move stuff from the current branch to somewhere else, versus &#x27;git merge&#x27;, to &#x27;move&#x27; stuff from somewhere else to the current branch, always gives me pause.)<p>I&#x27;m most grateful to this website for telling me about &#x27;git branch -f <branch name> <destination>&#x27; as a way to repoint a ref. To think that all this time I thought you had to checkout the ref, reset --soft, then maybe checkout again if you wanted to get HEAD back to where it started (all the while dealing with the side effects and possible conflicts with your working directory). None of the tutorials or books I had read, such as &quot;git for computer scientists&quot;, &quot;Think Like a Git&quot;, or the &quot;Pro Git&quot; book ever mentioned (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) that fairly fundamental operation despite schooling me quite thoroughly in the &quot;think of the object graph&quot; mindset. (Yeah it&#x27;s in the man page, but then there&#x27;s a lot of stuff in the manpage so noticing it is the problem there. And I tend to assume any option named &quot;--force&quot; is something that I shouldn&#x27;t be messing with. Why not &quot;git repoint-ref&quot; or &quot;git move-ref&quot; anyway? Git has so many top-level commands already, it doesn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re worried about polluting that namespace.)",1372171886

Surely with what you&#x27;ve built, you have made yourself highly employable, and if you&#x27;re in a big-time accelerator, you probably know people who need your skills.\n4) Make a &quot;personal pivot&quot;, and use the skills and experience you&#x27;ve developed to springboard into something else.<p>I&#x27;ve come to learn that the discourse in the startup world is completely slanted toward success stories, even though success is far from the most common outcome. Almost no one gets it right the first time.<p>For example, from my own limping startup, I&#x27;ve learned a lot about what I did that didn&#x27;t set myself up for success, and how I would do it differently. I got a day job--which I&#x27;m loving so far--and I&#x27;m planning to save a substantial portion of my pay to build a warchest over the next few years, such that next time, I won&#x27;t dive in already broke (just one of several crucial things I would do differently).",1372171538

At some point the researchers at IBM showed their work in progress on DES to the NSA, and the NSA made a few suggestions on improvements, one of them was a different set of S-Boxes (basically a bunch of constants used as part of the cipher.) IBM analyzed the new S-Boxes and could find no weaknesses so they used the ones the NSA recommended.<p>Over a decade later, differential cryptanalysis was discovered and it turned out that the tweaks the NSA had suggested made DES particularly resistant to differential cryptanalysis.<p>After doing some googling, it seems like the gap has closed since that book was written. They are still ahead, but not as much as they were in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s. Or maybe that&#x27;s just what they want us to think ;)",1372171490

And I don&#x27;t mean it as a &quot;told you so&quot; to the OP, but rather hopefully some cautionary advice for would-be founders.<p>I have come to the opinion that if you are bootstrapping, you have no business calling your company a startup. You are building a small business. And there is nothing shameful about this. You are among solid companions with your local plumbers, restaurants, and barbers. You make a good living building a sustainable business that is growing steadily but slowly, to serve a small group of loyal customers.<p>But you are not a startup.<p>Startups are about growth. About chasing metrics like 5% week over week. About going from 100 customers to 100,000 in a month. That is the reason you take VC money. It&#x27;s not &quot;I have this idea for a business, but I need some money to quit my job while I work on it&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;I have an idea for a business that could be huge but I need to build it up <i>fast</i>&quot;.<p>So when I see someone bemoaning the advice they were given by their investors, telling them they should be meeting all these crazy metrics, I can&#x27;t help but ask, what did you expect? The VC isn&#x27;t in the business of slow, organic growth of your company. They are in the business of generating a return for their fund within a relatively short timeframe. The advice you get is their best effort to try and help you find &quot;explosive&quot; growth.<p>Before you sign your bootstrapped business on for investment money, ask yourself: is this business, and more importantly am I, really suited for massive, short term growth?",1372171343

5939610,comment,5938633,5939378,3,0,dasil003,,,"> <i>What is it exactly that Snowden did that so many Americans consider to be bad?</i><p>I don&#x27;t think anyone who thinks Snowden is a traitor actually has considered it at all, they are just eating up the standard post-911 narrative that has been driving this country for over a decade now.  The problem is that being anti-terrorism is such a political bi-partisan pillar that even appearing to rationally consider the cost-benefit (let alone the constitutionality!) of something as obscene as the NSA&#x27;s domestic spying program in its current form is political suicide .  It&#x27;s a sad state of affairs, but the public debate driven by politicians is based on the strength of Twitter-length arguments.  Based on current sentiment, can you can concoct a stronger sound bite pro or anti NSA surveillance?  Critical thinking doesn&#x27;t enter into it at all.<p>That&#x27;s why only the people can change this debate.  We need to convince each other of the slippery slope we&#x27;re on, and the futility of an ever-increasing police state in 100% prevention of terrorism.  Then we need to make the politicians aware that we do believe in the first and fourth ammendments, and that we will <i>not</i> allow our proxy power to be used to spy on ourselves en masse, and we will vote out of office any politician who does not respect the limits of government power.<p>A little help from the media would be nice, but big media is almost as beholden to political winds as politicians are these days.",1372170242

(Sounds kludgey, but really did work better than 90% of solutions to date.)<p>But if you mean a provider providing IMAP access to RSS feeds, that could work great. I don&#x27;t know how to deal with updated items, but there is probably a way, especially if you had a custom client for key platforms. And 2nd tier platforms could still use an IMAP mail client.<p>Ok! Great idea, so... Somebody: go!!",1372168921

When they stopped using electronic communications their organization suffered. Then, it was the movements of a courier that gave away Bin Laden.<p>So, regardless of whether you think it&#x27;s OK for the NSA to spy on everyone, this push did break down Al Quaida&#x27;s organization.<p>Whether it affects cell oriented terrorism (or &#x27;lone wolf&#x27; terrorism) is another matter. For example, for the Boston bombers one of them did mention something about terrorism and came on the radar, but the FBI misjudged the threat.",1372168916

In a perfect scenario I would rather the NSA not store my communications at all, and have them no reason to even look at me to assume I am either good or bad.<p>But, unfortunately, looking at the absolute pushback from congress and the white house over this whole thing, it&#x27;s pretty clear the citizens have absolutely 0 say in the matter. After all, we&#x27;re just ignorant sheep. They&#x27;re the ones will all the knowledge and we should just trust them. We&#x27;re not going to be able to change the NSA&#x27;s policies or magically make everyone follow the constitution and the law to the T overnight. This is a compromise on our end.<p>The NSA may have a large amount of resources for storing and running attacks on my emails, but they don&#x27;t have limitless resources. For every hour they spend bruteforcing my keys to recover a sappy &quot;Just thinking of you <3&quot; to my wife, the less time they&#x27;re spending bruteforcing someone else&#x27;s emails.",1372168870

Which Reagan cranked into high gear in the 1980s, in response to the crack epidemic, by introducing mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession.  Penalties for possessing crack were, infamously, 100 times those for an equivalent amount of powder cocaine. Congress revisited the issue in 2011 and reduced the ratio.  Now it&#x27;s just 20:1.<p>Most crack users are black, and so, as a result, are disproportionately many prison inmates.  Only 13% of the population is black.

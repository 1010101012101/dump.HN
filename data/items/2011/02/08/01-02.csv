Quoting the article: ""[...] we also find dramatic erosion in relative teacher earnings since 1960.""  See also figure C, ""Real weekly wage trends for teachers and others, 1979 - 2006"".  In short, teacher's have been taking a hit in the wallet for the privilege of teaching for 30-40 years.  In fact, if you're familiar with employment in America, you'll know the quality of teachers has fallen as women have been able to find alternate careers; we used to have a surplus of talented, skilled women who entered teaching because they were unable to pursue alternate careers.<p>A big part of this is no doubt due to Baumol's cost disease [2], but the trend in wages is real nonetheless.<p>I'm not sure why people on HN in particular, with an IMO more entrepreneurial mindset than most, are surprised that quality tends to follow wages.

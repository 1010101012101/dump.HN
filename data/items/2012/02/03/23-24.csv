I love the idea and I think you have a lot of potential and while I absolutely love your interface I don't think you'll have much success with ""normal"" users when they use it. The reason your service is absolutely fantastic is because it addresses the biggest problem Minecraft servers have right now (it's not plug and play -- daunting to inexperienced users) but your interface, although pretty, feels... confusing. It feels like it's designed for people who understand Minecraft, which is not your core audience!<p>Still, great work, good luck :-)",1328313447

Typically, when an employee submits their resignation letter, they are out of the company, literally or figuratively.<p>If an employer makes you a counter-offer, never, <i>ever</i> take it. First, you already have a reason that you wanted to quit. It's usually not _just_ for the money, but probably for other reasons (e.g. intellectual boredom). If you are unhappy with your job, more money will just not help. As someone wise told me once, ""Money is not a motivator, but lack of money is a de-motivator.""<p>Secondly, and more importantly, the reason the employer is making a counter-offer is not to entice you to stay, but to buy enough time to find someone else -- a <i>loyal</i> and qualified someone else -- to replace you. Effectively, they are making you the counter-offer so that they don't have to spend the time and money looking for someone and training them, when they can have you train them for six months (even with a slight-but-temporary increase in your salary). You will be let go as soon as the employer feels that the new employee has been trained adequately.<p>The moral is, once you submit the resignation letter, stick to your guns, and don't be fooled by counter-offers.<p>[Edit: forgot to add, another reason they prefer you to stay is so that you can finish your current project. This minimizes risks to your project, while at the same time training your replacement. The employer would only keep you until the current project is complete, and you will probably not get any new ones.]",1328311660

Take Google's codebase, since it's the one I know the best. A couple of the key decisions:<p>* Single rooted tree. Separated repositories would make it harder to share code, leading to more dupication.<p>* Build from head. We build everything from source, statically linked. No need to worry about multiple versions of dependencies, no lag between a bug fix and it being available to any and all binaries that need it, whenever they're next updated.<p>I don't think that an ""internal Github"" is going be a magic bullet here. It's more likely it would be a matter of trading one set of hard problems for another, as we all of a sudden need to figure out how to do cross-dependencies sanely, deal with multiple versions of libraries, etc, at scale. You are correct that one monolithic Perforce repo is a bit of a pain point, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the right decision is to shatter our codebase into different pieces - we'd rather make our repo scale better. For reference, we've already got hundreds of millions of lines of code, 20+ changes/minute 6 months ago (so what, 30+ now?), and plans for scaling the next 10x are in motion.<p>If you're interested, I recommend <a href=""http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/</a>.

If something's stupid or sucks, I'll say so.  If people disagree with me and have arguments to back up their disagreements I'll listen.  I have zero tolerance for responses along the lines of ""because I said so, just do it.""<p>In my experience, a lot of programmers are like this as well.<p>There came a time when the CEO of the company where gradeschool teachers were the management was replaced... by someone who also knew nothing about development.  She recognized all the problems with the product (which was being mismanaged) and I told her that the problem was management, how we'd tried to have reasonable practices, including repeated requests for a plan that we could stick to, and that the grade school teachers were in over their head. I recommend that they be put into a position to have input on the educational aspects of the product, but that engineering should be run by someone who understood engineering.  She told me that there would be no management changes, and she wanted me-- given that I was the most senior engineer-- to give her a plan for fixing things.  (Seemingly oblivious to the fact that I'd just given her the solution.)<p>I told her I'd been working on a plan and that I'd give it to her in 30 minutes.  Went back to my office, wrote a resignation letter, named the fact that management made product progress impossible as the reason, and handed it to her.   She said ""That was fast"" and I said, it's not what you're expecting, and walked out of the office, never to return. (I had been on the bubble already, and would have resigned earlier if the events that led to her becoming the new CEO hadn't occurred.)<p>I cannot think of anything more compelling than explaining why things were broken, making suggestions for how to fix it, those being rejected out of hand, and then emphasizing the point with a resignation.  I was committed enough that I gave up my job, without a replacement lined up.  I don't know what more could have possibly underlined the seriousness of my position to her.<p>Do you think she learned anything by this?   No management changes were made, but apparently I did have some impact: The gradeschool teachers got even more hysterical and neurotic after I left, starting to accuse employees of paranoid conspiracies, etc.  More and more people started resigning.  The company failed not long after this.<p>It is my considered impression that most people who are clueless are not interested in thinking about things-- when something unusual happens, like my resignation-- they just assume that its a reflection on me, rather than the situation.   Everyone working on the product knew the problem, there wasn't debate among us, but management was too ignorant to even understand that the problem was management.<p>The grade school teachers saw everything thru that lens-- they thought ""their kids"" were screwing around or wasting time, or wanting to do thing their own way rather than the way they needed to be done, and so they believed it was just irresponsibility that was causing the product problems.  Meanwhile we were getting whiplash as they changed their opinions and positions and demands for what the product would do on a weekly basis.<p>One thing I've noticed in bad managers that is pretty consistent-- they tend to change their mind about what the product should do, and then think that their subordinates are slacking when the product doesn't do the new thing.  Even thought they may have wasted 6 months under a prior plan, they don't account for that-- all those six months are credited towards the new plan, and why wasn't it done already if you had 6 months?<p>In the case of the grade school teachers, this product was a magical wonderland where anything they could dream up could be created-- and any time their thoughts changed the product could change without any cost at all, cause to them it was totally plastic.<p>So anytime someone said that these changes would take time and have impact on other things, they thought the person was just being lazy and didn't want to make the changes.<p>I remember once, there was a rumor that a VC firm associated with Bill Gates might be investing, and so my boss came in and told me we had to replace all of our linux based infrastructure (file server, email server, web server, etc) with Windows.  ""If bill gate finds out we're using linux we won't get funded!""   I told him it was silly as things were working fine... so he brought in a ""windows consultant"" who told us we needed to buy 4 new top of the line servers to replace our one spare developer PC that was doing all the work currently, cause ""You can't run a web server and and FTP server on the same machine!""  Naturally the grade school teacher believed his over priced consultant- who was telling him what he wanted to hear- over his engineer.<p>How was he to know any different?  He's a grade school teacher.  (He now has a significant position at Microsoft, which I think is hilarious....)",1328310884

3549496,comment,3548445,3548860,7,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I think there are four recurring mistakes that cause these comical situations. Two are technical and two are social.<p>The first technical mistake is using communications tools with built-in latency: e-mail instead of IM/IRC, conference call that everyone must dial into at a specific time instead of starting with at least two people on a call and calling others to join in real time. E-mail and scheduled dial-in conference calls must be just about the <i>least</i> efficient methods of professional communication ever invented.<p>The other technical mistake is not having software for remote communications, particularly desktop sharing/presentations, that is readily available at the click of a mouse and familiar enough for all participants to set it up in moments. (A related mistake is using a dial-in conference service that isn't actually reliable. If you can't find one that works as it's supposed to -- and a lot of them don't, IME -- then you can at least ask someone to spend a bit of time and money installing an in-house solution if you need this facility often.)<p>The first social mistake is allowing one person's lack of preparation to waste time for everyone in the group. There is no excuse for coming to multiple people and asking them to set up a call to discuss a bug when you don't know the bug number, nor for them not to have the details in front of them when joining the call. It's basic good practice for any meeting that everyone know in advance who will be attending, why, and what the goals of the meeting are, that someone lead the meeting efficiently, and that the results be circulated promptly afterwards. If you get to the scale where you have to involve multiple people at the same time, failing to do these things will almost inevitably waste time, and again it will often be the whole group's time while one individual sorts out something they should have done earlier.<p>The second social mistake is being accepting of people who are late when a large meeting has been scheduled. Whenever possible, the meeting should start precisely on-time, and should not deviate from the published agenda to bring latecomers up to speed. If they miss out, it's their job to catch up afterwards, not the entire group's job to spin its wheels while someone recaps. If key people are consistently late and wasting others' time in this way, that is a serious management issue and someone needs to address why it is happening. Otherwise, you get to having a dozen people on the call, and if one key person is 10 minutes late because they were ""just finishing an e-mail"" then you've found another way to turn 10 minutes into two hours...",1328310432

AFAIK, this is basically the same way Ruby operates. They aren't likely to make vast, crazy changes, but I don't think, say, a PEP for static typing would get very far either.<p>And I think it's kind of a basic misconception that V8 is made just with web browsers in mind. If you look on the V8 developer site, nowhere does it say anything close to that. Their stated objective is ""fast execution of large JavaScript applications."" They go out of their way to draw a distinction between the browser and the engine, explaining what is and isn't part of JavaScript (e.g. the DOM is just an interface that browsers choose to expose). Is Chrome the original client for V8? Sure. And shell scripts were the original use case for Python. It seems to me that ""V8 is just a browser language"" is the new ""Python is just a scripting language.""<p>And I wouldn't describe the language-level ability to write asynchronous code in a synchronous fashion a fundamental feature. It's really cool and allows a lot of expressiveness, but so would a lot of potential changes in, say, Ruby. If you don't want the language feature, there are really nice libraries that get you most of the way there.

Sure, I had professors who mumbled complicated concepts into their beards and professors whose language could not necessarily be classified as English, but my white and Asian male classmates could not understand them any better than I could.<p>You cannot hinge on your love for science in high school and blame the school for not making it touchy-feely enough for you to succeed in STEM majors.  Sure I had classes I couldn't hack in university, but I came to terms with the fact that it was a limit of my ability and did not blame it on a professor or the way the subject was taught.<p>Yes, I believe that we do need more women in STEM majors, but it can only be achieved by encouraging women to stick with it and persist, alongside her white and Asian male peers, not by making excuses for her shortcomings, bailing out and then appealing to the university to make STEM major lectures into vagina monologues.<p>I am sure that your mother can confirm that her college career was not a walk in a park and she is actually in the discinpline that nowadays has the highest number of women.<p>STEM majors are like the plains of the Serengeti.  It's the survival of the fittest.  And those of us that survived wouldn't have it any other way.",1328310006

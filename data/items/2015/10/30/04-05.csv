Conversely if it doesn&#x27;t meet basic standards, why not let a bot ask for changes?<p>What if I train a refactor bot to make trivial refactorings? Naming, extract method, extract interface, warn on over coupling? If the cost of backing out a patch in the future is near zero, the cost of applying a patch today is also near zero. If the person making the change has a good track record, why not automerge?",1446181166

So, when you decide to post a picture to Facebook, that&#x27;s when Android asks if you want to give the Facebook app access to your pictures on storage.  If you deny it, it lets the app know it doesn&#x27;t have access.  If it&#x27;s an older app that doesn&#x27;t understand, it gets fake data as if you had no photos (or no contacts, etc).

Since Windows 7, it&#x27;s been &quot;reasonable&quot; in a highly managed corporate environment, and not bad even out of the box.  8, 8.1, and 10 have been improvements on that.  It&#x27;s actually easier to do a 10k user highly locked down Windows deployment (although expensive, and involving a lot of experts and third-party tools) than to do a 10k user locked down Mac OS X deployment.  Apple had a lot of advantages by starting from UNIX and from basically starting after security was a &quot;thing&quot;, but hasn&#x27;t done as good a job on OS X security as I&#x27;d like.  iOS, on the other hand, is amazing -- the only serious deficiencies I find with iOS are a lack of &quot;enterprise as sole root of trust&quot; (which no one does, with the possible exception of (Blackberry Pre-10 and post-10), or roll-your-own open source linux/bsd with a lot of trusted computing grafted on in ways which are not at all trivial to do), and a lack of emphasis on anti-forensics on the device itself -- if you unlock it, it contains an sqllite db with ~every message, which shouldn&#x27;t be how they do it.<p>OTOH, on cloud services, Google is far and away superior to Apple.  The biggest problem with Apple is you&#x27;re largely pushed toward iCloud which is not amazing from a security perspective.  The true win of ChromeOS was you were equally pushed to the Google ecosystem, which is amazing for cloud service security -- the sole problem being you&#x27;re 100% exposed to Google, Inc. which is both a US company and a single third-party entity, but if you had to pick a single company to be responsible for your cloud services security, you&#x27;d probably pick Google on the merits.",1446177873

I only trust that which is done by pro&#x27;s with review, esp with high assurance methods. Most things aren&#x27;t like that. Easy to see how the interpretations would get conflated a lot.<p>Far as help or review, there&#x27;s a false dilemma that goes around between something being so open I put it in a Hacker&#x27;s News comment and totally closed. In reality, there&#x27;s many things between with the review being more important than openness. I tried to address it in this write-up:<p><a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/05/friday_squid_bl_424.html#c6051639"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/05/friday_squid_...</a><p>Goal was to get people to consider proprietary, open-source models more to ensure steady flow of cash to maintain/audit security-critical software. Dual-licensing at the least. Might prevent another OpenSSL debacle.<p>Far as actively developed, that&#x27;s a good point. The trick there is to make sure you have guidelines for how to use the security-critical functionality and <i>stick to them</i>. The common stuff that&#x27;s prone to error is done in a way that defaults to security. An example is how Ada or Rust approach memory/concurrency safety vs C. Not a guarantee by itself but raises bar considerably. The parts that are obfuscated have little risk on the security-critical aspects and are more about changing likelihood that shellcode will do its job. There&#x27;s even methods in academia to do this automatically at compiler level.<p>So, this is what I&#x27;m saying. You should definitely have pro&#x27;s in-house or (if possible) externally to review the design for flaws. Just do Correct by Construction, make design as boring as possible, and obfuscate the hell out of any aspect you can without introducing risk.<p>An example from my work when I did high security consulting was to put guards in front of any networked service. The guard blocked attacks like DMA, TCP/IP, whatever. The messages they passed along were simple, easy to parse, and landed directly in the application. The application itself had automatic checking of buffers, etc. My biggest trick, though, was to use the guard to fake a certain platform/ISA (Windows/Linux on x86) while app actually ran on different OS and ISA (eg POWER/SPARC/Alpha/MIPS). They&#x27;d hit it constantly with stuff too clever for me to even want to waste time understanding. Never executed because they couldn&#x27;t see what they needed to see. And all the good security hardening, patches, monitoring, and whatnot. Strong security practices + effective obfuscation = TLA&#x27;s remote attacks stood no chance. :)",1446177681

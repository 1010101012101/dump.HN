My point is they aren&#x27;t cheap and you could simply be wasting money. I&#x27;m honestly not informed enough either way, but when I looked into them a few years ago, there was little to no proven benefits of using them.",1430535576

9475675,comment,9475436,9475643,0,0,kaolinite,,,"I think you misread my comment. I wasn&#x27;t comparing Edition with a gold Rolex, just a low-end (perhaps second hand) stainless steel Explorer / AirKing / etc. If you see someone wearing a fake stainless steel Rolex, there&#x27;s a genuine possibility that it&#x27;s real (assuming you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s fake). But with Edition, the chance of it being real is pretty low. Thus, wearing a gold plated Apple Watch is pretty obvious.<p>I&#x27;m well aware of the costs of a Rolex (and most watch brands, I&#x27;m a watch enthusiast). You can pick up a Rolex for a few thousand pounds in Britain. New, they start at around £4000ish. Gold watches in general cost a lot more, especially if they have a gold link bracelet, and you&#x27;re right that Edition is priced fairly competitively.<p>A stainless steel Rolex is, whilst quite a bit of money, affordable if you decide that you want it. I don&#x27;t live in a major city and yet I&#x27;ll still see a few on the wrists of people if I take a trip around town. Edition, however, would be quite a sighting - similar (in terms of required wealth), in my opinion, to seeing a complicated Patek on a wrist. (Whilst the prices are different, I&#x27;m saying this because of the upgrade issue, i.e. a £100K Patek will last many lifetimes, a gold Edition will be useless in less than 5 years).",1430534787

It&#x27;s an Idris interface that wraps around the Erlang primitives and OTP behaviors so as to generate Erlang code from a verified Idris implementation.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting way to get around the dynamically typed nature of Erlang, as some of its properties have meant that despite several attempts, no one has managed to retrofit a complete type system yet, though Dialyzer provides approximate inference, in a similar manner to what I believe is a SAT solver.<p>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s worth noting that Erlang&#x27;s dynamically typed nature is nowhere near as much of an impediment as in other languages precisely due to fault tolerance guarantees from preemptively scheduled isolated actors and standard OTP behaviors providing supervision links, plus the fact that you pattern match on literal values. This and the encapsulation provided by modules leads to a remarkable system resilience even without much of a typing discipline, which shows that robust systems should have many other properties besides the type system.<p>Even still, anything to formally verify Erlang behaviors is a welcome advance. A rigorous approach is likely to uncover plenty of bugs and strengthen BEAM, which in turn will improve Elixir and others as well.",1430533259

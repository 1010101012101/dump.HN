Breaks in the skin are always a huge infection risk, compounded by the fact that implanted hardware is always an infection risk, especially ones that are exposed.  The reason being that implants do not have convenient blood vessels coursing through them like us meat bags, and thus the white blood cells that fight infection can&#x27;t really clear any bacteria that happens to stick onto the surface of these things.   Keeping things under the skin solves a lot of these problems.    The experimental Utah arrays with the Braingate consortium are in fact externalized, (mostly due to bandwidth limitations of the hardware) and managing those folks are pretty tricky.<p>A port would be nice - I think a more pressing need for &quot;ports&quot; would be the critical care and oncology (cancer) folks - patients who need to provide access to the bloodstream.

Similarly, drugs like Ritalin are legal in Israel and can be had by anyone if they just get a script from a doc (no need for a diagnosis). In the long run I think we as a society need to grow up about this stuff, as use of some of these meds in moderation is fine either for light occasional use by those without severe focus issues, or prescription based moderate use by those that have ADHD.<p>Instead of sitting around and writing articles about &#x27;omg millions of college kids and high intellectual work professionals take drugs, holy shit no one has ever taken drugs to create things before!&#x27;, we just need to get real and be responsible about the reality. Don&#x27;t stigmatize it, and allow people to responsibly explore the option with their doctors and see what works. Now if you disagree with this approach, you must argue that the health effects of moderate use is too severe, or the medication gives people an unfair advantage.<p>As far as changing careers, sure, that&#x27;s an option an individual can explore.

We couldn&#x27;t get the perf we wanted out of that system.  We ended-up with Outlook 2011&#x27;s database which still bites folks from time to time but has a lot more &quot;recoverability&quot; than previous products such as Entourage (where it users often cited being locked-out of their database).",1395099978

In a dangerous area, a camera cannot capture the entire environment that a police officer must take in, contextual clues to a possibly dangerous situation drawn from a career of near brushes with disaster. So you might see corner cases where a police officer either (a) disregards their gut feeling to exercise caution and speed when apprehending a suspect because they fear being captured on camera, and the officer is injured as a result, or (b) follows their gut feeling, exercises due caution and speed, perhaps is rough on a criminal who has violent intent, and then must allow the criminal to go free even if that caution was necessary, because the jury was more sympathetic to the video of so-called &quot;brutality&quot; than they were to the officer&#x27;s justifiable mental model of the situation, which cannot be presented so elegantly.<p>Would this system work for less dangerous areas?

In 1981 the Court ruled, in <i>Diamond v. Diehr</i> [3], that a claim to controlling an otherwise-conventional physical process by software was indeed patentable.  More recently, in <i>Bilski v. Kappos</i> [4], the Court affirmed a rejection of claims to a particular software-implemented method of hedging against the risk of price changes in commodities trading, but it refused to impose a categorical exclusion of patentability for such claims.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I seldom if ever read IP Watchdog anymore (the source of the parent comment&#x27;s long italicized quote).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottschalk_v._Benson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottschalk_v._Benson</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_v._Flook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_v._Flook</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_v._Diehr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_v._Diehr</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilski_v._Kappos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilski_v._Kappos</a>",1395098976

7418795,comment,7416561,7418328,18,0,loup-vaillant,,,"I for one would have failed the testing part entierly, for two reasons:<p>First, for a refactoring job, I would have assumed this was not running code, but a subset of something bigger.  I would hardly expect it to even compile, let alone pass tests. If I took this interview, I <i>may</i> have noticed the presence of tests, and I <i>may</i> have ran them if I did notice. Pretty unlikely.<p>Second, most of the refactoring I have done so far is based on local, semantic-preserving, transformations.  Those are extremely reliable (as in a couple mistakes every 50 modifications).  No point in running tests every few edits, unless they&#x27;re less than two kestrokes (and seconds) away.  If I do get in trouble, I still have Git.<p>---<p>When I think about it, I probably would have failed the code smell part as well: over the years, I have seen the utter superiority of the functional style over the imperative style in most cases.  This has consequences:<p>I sometimes use the ternary operator to initialize variables (or should I say <i>constants</i>).  The only thing ugly about this operator is its syntax.  Its semantics are cleaner than those of if(){}else{}, its imperative equivalent.<p>I often use multiple returns.  It&#x27;s the only way I can use if(){}else{} without relying on side effects.<p>I don&#x27;t shy away from switch statements, or their cascaded if() equivalents.  I may even use a cascaded ternary operator.  See, most of the time, the Expression Problem leans <i>heavily</i> in favour of sum types (tagged unions) and pattern matching, instead of class hierachies.  Java lacks sum types, so this means emulating them with a switch statement.  This is cumbersome, but less so than the equivalent class hierachy.<p>I shun getters and setters.  While I like my objects to be immutable, sometimes I do need a public mutable member variable.  Well, I&#x27;m honest about it, and use just that.  I dont hide it under the getter/setter carpet, unless it actually helps me enforce some specific invariant.  And I call my getters &quot;foo()&quot;, instead of the more customary &quot;getFoo()&quot;.  I want to emphasise the result, not the action of getting it.<p>I will probably end up writing ML in Java (except when it means fighting the interfaces around me, including the standard library).  But I do believe this generally results in shorter, cleaner, more reliable code than idomatic Java.  This stays true even in the face of readability issues (&quot;readability&quot; means you can&#x27;t use recursion, closures, or even first class booleans, because your poor colleagues lack some basic education —this is not a strawman, I have <i>lived</i> it).<p>So, your code smell may very well be my best practice.<p>This interview process would likely reject me.  Unless the interviewer has a relatively solid understanding of functional programming, he will just mark me off as sloppy, too clever, ignorant of OO principles, or even all three.  I can explain myself, but I only have half an hour, and this comment already took me twice that.",1395098395

The more I worry about how to squeeze productivity into a day or which tasks to work on to provide the most benefit (80/20!), the more anxious I feel. And it compounds. Because the next thought through my mind is &quot;I can fix this anxious feeling by planning things out better!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m beginning to think that maybe the best way off this train is to stop trying to optimize and control for variables entirely. It&#x27;s not enough to pick-and-choose, because then you&#x27;re just meta-optimizing (&quot;I&#x27;ll just figure out which of these to-do items is the MOST important!&quot;) Much akin to an alcoholic having just one drink, I think any sort of optimization thinking might be enough to get the cycle started again. Maybe the only way to tame it is to avoid it entirely.",1395097795

7418733,comment,7415660,7418244,37,0,lutusp,,,"Each experimental outcome has an associated probability that the outcome resulted from chance, not the thing being measured. This arises from the default scientific precept that is called the &quot;null hypothesis&quot;, the assumption that a given measurement was produced by chance, not nature.<p>Scientists use a value designated by p to describe the probability that a result arose by chance rather than design. In the social sciences, a p value of 0.01 - 0.05 is common, which means a result can be explained by chance with a 1% to 5% probability. As one moves through fields of greater rigor and seriousness, the p value required to declare a discovery becomes smaller. In experimental physics, 5σ (five sigma) has become the standard.<p>In statistics, σ refers to an area under the normal distribution defined in terms of standard deviations (1σ = 1 standard deviation). Experimental physics uses a one-tailed 5σ value, which is quite strict -- it has a numerical value of about 3×10-7. What this means is that an experimental result must be solid enough (and/or be repeated often enough) that the probability that it arose from chance is equal to or less than 5σ.<p>More here: <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2012/07/17/five-sigmawhats-that/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2012/07/17/...</a>",1395097590

In this world, patents aren&#x27;t viewed negatively the way they are in the software world. First because the capital requirements to enter the field are high, so you don&#x27;t have little companies for whom a patent suit is an existential crisis. Second, because development is capital intensive. Pratt & Whitney develops new turbine blade designs, and patents them because developing them is tremendously expensive. In software, there is a huge field of things that are patentable that don&#x27;t fulfill the economic rationale of patent (protecting expensive capital investment from free riding).

If you try and make it so that voters have to queue for 8 hours to lodge a vote in order to marginalise them, people will give up and go to another polling station. People here complain bitterly if they have to wait an hour to vote.<p>If someone did try the voting date switcheroo and succeeded in stopping a sizeable portion of people from voting, the most likely outcome - apart from the scandal - would be that the Australian Electoral Commission would call for a repeat of the voting for that electorate.

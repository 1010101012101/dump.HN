Since Patry took the blog down temporarily and is now putting it back up, I'm going to copy paste the relevant post here.<p>The Executive Branch of our government has been on an IP public relations binge lately, strutting like a peacock and showing off its finest colors of commitment to strong IP rights. Alberto Gonzalez has been paraded out much like Johnny Depp without the eyeliner, vanquishing those pesky pirates. The Office of United States Trade Representative (before Mr. Zoellick's recent departure to Wall Street), strides the globe like the Colossus of Rhodes, mau-mauing (""Mzungu Aende Ulaya — Mwafrika Apate Uhuru!"") small and medium size countries into agreeing to DMCA and even DMCA+ provisions. The Administration is solidly on message: IP 'R U.S.<p>Except, perhaps when it comes to the Government's own conduct. In Blueport Co. LLP v. United States, the Government successfully asserted a defense of sovereign immunity against a charge that it had violated 17 USC Section 1201, the DMCA's anti-circumvention provision. Federal Federal Claims Judge Lawrence Block described the factual allegations:<p>The bare facts of the matter now before the court are quite simple. It involves a copyrighted computer management information program and the alleged attempts by the U.S. Air Force to circumvent technological safeguards designed to protect the program. Plaintiff is a limited liability corporation, organized in the State of Idaho. On March 6, 2000, plaintiff acquired all the rights to a computer program entitled AUMD and AUMD Admin (“computer program”) from Mr. Mark Davenport, who was then a Technical Sergeant in the Air Force. Allegedly, the computer program greatly increased the efficiency with which Air Force manpower resource requirement reports were generated. The computer program contained an automatic expiration function, so that the program would stop operating on a particular date. This feature was included in the program to control licensing and to prevent unauthorized use beyond the license expiration date. Plaintiff alleges, in essence, that Air Force personnel unlawfully “hacked” into the computer program to alter the automatic expiration function, to the Air Force's advantage.<p>The defense was not as one might have expected, that the work was ab initio one of the United States government and therefore not protected by virtue of Section 105, but that the governement cannot - ever - be sued for DMCA violations because Congress did not expressly provide for express waiver of such immunity. Plaintiff referred the court to a number of exemptions in Section 1201 that refer to conduct by federal employees, exemptions that would not make sense absent liability, but the bottom line was simple: without express liability, the Government is free to be a DMCA scofflaw.<p>The ball is now in Congress's court.",1218216495

Namespacing the entire public interface behind one executable feels cleaner.<p>I suspect the underlying reason people complain about this is that it's a particularly visible instance of hg having a vastly cleaner public interface than git. Of course, one person's ""feeling cleaner"" is another person's ""easier to write scripts/extensions for that won't break every time the public interface to the relevant exposed internals change in the slightest way"". There seems to be much less effort to encapsulate the git interface for consistent external usage.*<p>Some people will prefer git for just this reason, though: You can easily get at the internals, if necessary.

Their only real focus is to preserve a reputation as the cheapest no frills airline in Europe, and do everything possible to make their ticket prices appear lower than competitors.  Or maybe they're just one of the sleazier companies out there.<p>While their base ticket prices may seem incredibly low, they make their profits by tagging on extra ""service fees"" that appear on their website after you've begun checking out.

The UI of the Ryanair website stresses the importance of this baggage insurance with a popup window.  Other airline comparison sites probably have decent UIs that don't push these options to the extent of Ryanair.<p>They also go to great lengths to cut any cost.  I've heard that employees are not allowed to charge phones at work in order to save on energy bills.

Once the issues were effectively documented and explained, they released updated versions of Ruby 1.8.6 and 1.8.7 quite quickly.<p>The problem was simple that the core team doesn't use Rails, so they didn't test the patches they produced with non-trivial Rails apps. When other people did that testing, they got segfaults, freaked out, and basically tried to tell the core team that their release process was shit, and that they should let a bunch of outsiders tell them how to manage their releases.<p>Personally, I was embarrassed to be part of the English-speaking Ruby community during that entire episode.",1218215406

270740,comment,270528,270552,0,0,unalone,,,"It is if it's done in the purist way Facebook uses it. Sounds dumb but bear with me for a moment.<p>Facebook is all about levels of communication. You can tag somebody to draw their attention to what you've done, you can write on their wall to chat publicly, you can write privately if it's either a walled-in discussion (set number of speakers) or if it's something too sensitive to say out loud.<p>Poking, which I think I'm right in saying Facebook made first, is a method of bridging the small gap where you want to talk to somebody but you don't know what to say. It's the equivalent of small talk when you do it with friends: it's just a matter of alerting them to your presence. With people you don't know so well, it's even more a matter of flirtation: you don't have to explain your poke, or pretend there's a reason. All they know is that you've poked them, for whatever reason, and by doing so you've been brought to their attention.<p>So, if it's being copied in the exact same manner, used in the exact same way (where ""poke"" is an option on the level of ""send message"" and ""add friend"" on every menu), then yeah, they might have a point about copying a feature. Poking is simple like Twitter is: yes, it's basic, but what matters is implementation.<p>Also, regarding that site's layout: yech. It's like they took the brilliantly minimal Facebook design without realizing what made it such a brilliant design, and added tweaks to something they didn't quite understand. Sickening.",1218215279

What the commenter is saying is that if candidate employees are in competition for jobs with candidates from other jurisdictions where noncompetes are enforceable, and many people don't really care about noncompetes, the candidates in the places with enforceable noncompetes have a market advantage. They can exchange a noncompete agreement for job opportunities.<p>The commenter is making the point that you always had the freedom not to sign noncompetes, even when they were enforceable, just as you have the freedom not to work 70 hour weeks for a $150k salaried job: don't accept the job. But you probably want the opportunity to work the odd 70 hour week, if it advances your career.<p>For a slippery-slope alternative to the ""freedom"" you're talking about, see France in the mid-90's, and try to start a competitive software shop there.<p>Like I said, I disagree with the commenter, because noncompetes are wildly abused in our industry.

I can speak from my own RSI hell week experience, as well as that of the two RSIs at which I was on staff.  Hell week is intense.  That sort of intensity isn't sustainable, but is necessary in bursts both for research and startups.<p>While the research is necessarily academic, the passion and focus can translate to any other field.  And I know for me, a Midwestern boy at the tender age of 16, coming to MIT and meeting 70+ students from around the world who all were smart and intense was both eye opening and inspiring.  Tyle's comment makes perfect sense to me, and he doesn't mean it in a demeaning or superior way.  It's just that for many students, including myself, RSI was the first time we met people our own age who clicked with his on an intellectual level.  And for nerds like me, that's a closer sort of connection.<p>You're correct that there isn't a direct causation here, but the spirit can translate easily into entrepreneurship.  For example, RSI alums Ben Rahn and Matt DeBergalis started ActBlue back in 2004, and they've seen incredible success with it since.",1218214806

Five or ten years ago, we didn't have Ruby (or at least a mature RoR), Django, Clojure, or Scala (to name a few), so PHP was a pretty decent option for someone trying to get something out there efficiently.  These days, there are lots of interesting platform choices (all with different barriers for entry), so many ""serious"" developers have moved in different directions.",1334055589

We do have a Due Diligence section on the forums in addition to ones on valuation, buying of websites, selling websites etc.<p>In my ten years plus of buying websites, I've noticed one massive change - the decline in quality and truth. Sellers have become very sharp at scamming buyers - faking traffic, faking revenue, faking the prospects of the business. It's a mine field and it's largely due to the emergence of the career seller, someone who creates sites just to sell. He is unable to make money with the site himself, but has an incentive to convince others that they can make money out of it.<p>Some of them run ""site flipping"" courses and talk a lot about ""passive income from websites"". Flippa has encouraged these site flippers as all their chatter does drive business.<p>Our forum has long been cynical and critical of some of these practices and we are, I believe, the largest destination on the internet for intelligent, unbiased comment on the subject of buying and selling websites and have exposed some of the biggest site selling scams on the internet including those of a couple of really sharp, high-end ""template"" sellers swindling buyers out of $50K+ for sites worth less than $500!<p>The ""Just Sold"" section, sheff, is filled with a fair amount of fiction.

I decided to look this up for the first time because at some point I read some thread where some US people were actively discussing interpretation of your Constitution or the Bill of Rights, as to whether something fairly trivial to define could be ruled or not--might even have had to do with the right to bear arms, but the specifics aren't important. I was just amazed that this centuries-old document was <i>seriously</i> being ""consulted"" as if somewhere between the lines would appear some sort of hidden meaning--except it was pretty obvious that the final decision would rest with the interpretation and political ideas of whatever judge got to rule it. Which completely <i>amazed</i> me, it's one thing if somnewhere, in some obscure corner of fiscal tax laws some particular exception to a rule isn't defined unambiguously, but the big-to-medium picture of the law is not supposed to be up for interpretation!<p>Except in the US, or more precisely in Common Law legal systems, that's pretty much the idea.<p>I'm not saying it's bad BTW, it's just different. And I'm just commenting on how surprised I was that there's other ways (in democratic countries) than to strictly codify your laws.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#2._Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#2._Common_law_legal_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)</a>",1334055037

In my experience of 6 years as a web developer, the faster and the more explicitly something fails the better. If the user gets a 500, that's a pretty clear sign of a problem, I get an email notification about it, including user id, session data etc. Then, in most cases, I can easily see what the problem was, decide what the correct behaviour is and create a fix immediately and even notify the user after releasing it if I wish to do it. If there is no exception there is a case in the code I was not aware of when writing it and it will still not be brought to my attention. In the best case, the user will report some problem with the functionality and I will have to spends hours trying to find the logs for this user and reproduce the problem, which will now be much harder, quite some time could have passed since the error, the database entries for the user could have change meanwhile (including corruption caused by the system continuing to operate despite an error) and so on. In the worst case, the bug will continue to affect users (which might not even know what the intended behaviour was) and I will learn about it a year from now, accidentally.<p>Reproducing bugs is hard enough in web applications due to their distributed nature, some of the applications I worked on had serious business-affecting bugs that went unnoticed for months and failure to clearly signal errors is one of the common cases. It doesn't matter whether you are in banking or just building another social CMS/CRM ""kind of thing"", if you have bugs you loose users and with them money.<p>See also: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast</a>",1334054616

I'll share an anecdote. It's true. I hesitate to share true ridiculous-sounding anecdotes with skeptical people, because the natural response is more skepticism, perhaps even mocking. But what the hell, it's true and maybe something interesting will come of it --<p>You see, ambition and hubris and uncalled-for faith in yourself both offputs a lot of people (perhaps, yourself) and also gets you into hot water. After having a confirmed appointment cancelled by one of the Director of Communications at one of the largest international organizations in the world, I got into a shouting match with him and was almost arrested.<p>You know, I had nowhere near the relevant authority, gravitas, channels to actually be justified in being offended at being brushed off and cancelled. In retrospect, this was... sort of ridiculous.<p>However, that same hubris that got me into the shouting match (with threat of arrest, and all), was applied when being brushed off in a similar situation - and the same pressing and indignant behavior led to us to a meeting with a high ranked diplomatic officer, and later their Minister of Foreign Affairs for a large charity project we're doing.<p>I was, in retrospect, probably completely unqualified to launch this project. However, having run on faith and hubris for a while, something of substance happened, and once you've got something tangible it becomes possible to recruit actual professionals (what'd Eric Schmidt call himself when he originally joined Google? ""adult supervision""?) -- and we did, and continue to do so.<p>So, I don't know. If you want to be happy, have low expectations, find a vocation you truly enjoy, live below your means, and spend time with your friends and family, do lots of relaxing, spend time in nature, read books, and have a healthy physical life and sex life.<p>I have absolutely the highest level of respect for anyone who manages this true happiness, and would never once more encourage someone to set unrealistic goals and ambitions far beyond their caliber in order to attempt to drive the world forwards.

It goes back to the idea of what's value for one person isn't necessarily value for another.<p>We run the A-List Newsletter which reviews sales of web businesses both from Flippa and from private brokers (<a href=""http://www.flipfilter.com/a-list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flipfilter.com/a-list</a>) with a value generally above $10K. Each month I look at the top five sellers for that month (in terms of sale price) and the most active (in terms of bids). The top five can vary wildly; in February it seemed they were all Clickbank Sites that sold products in the MMO niche and followed the same formula of launch to a pre-established list, marketing the hell out of upsells and downsells, selling the business then using the initial list (now much larger post launch) to do it again.<p>The most active however are pretty much always sites that sell Internet Marketing Services - for example, a site which sells Facebook likes or one which offers Social Bookmarking services. Their final selling price is always around the $1 - $2K mark and they often end with in excess of 50 bids despite only being a few months old and having no real barrier to entry (ironically, the same sellers will often sell the same templated site again under a different banner a few weeks later). IMO, the sad part is the people who buy these sites tend to be new to the industry and no real information to tell them that this isn't a the easiest way to get a return on their investment.<p>There's going to be good and bad at every price range, and likewise types of sites which tend to do well (Adsense with earnings history, Clickbank affiliate sites, Email Newsletters, anything with a big list in the MMO industry) and things that don't (Web Apps with complex backends, Ecommerce with physical products, News sites which require 'real' journalism) but that doesn't mean the sites which don't sell well aren't worth something to the right buyer.<p>This isn't defending the truly bad stuff or the sometimes fraudulent sellers that you occasionally see on there - it's going to happen for reasons that probably boil down to resources, but if even 10% of Flippa listings based on the 1,000s it has are 'good' then it still has more to offer than a site with 80% good but only 15 listings.",1334052750

At college or university many will have a lot of further contact with many computer science concepts. Its a lot like math, really: everyone knows the basics (or has at least heard them once and promptly forgotten them), but that doesnt make everyone a mathatician.<p>(My dad, a construction engineer, learnt programming at college in the freaking late 70s. He never needed it during his long and successful career as a construction engineer, though, and has forgotten all about it. Today, anyone who studies anything to do with social sciences  for example  needs to have some coding skills if they want to do effective statistical analysis.)<p>There is a difference between that and building your own app.",1334052329

I bet it depends on your geographic location a lot. Sure, if you get powerful direct sunlight on your skin it's important, but here (NL) that's just a few weeks per year, <i>if we're lucky</i> :-) -- And yes, that's when I wear sunscreen, it's just that considering scientifically proven benefits, I don't understand why ""wear sunscreen"" is stressed so much vs ""eat many fresh vegetables"" or ""do something that really raises your heart frequency once per day, even just shortly"" sound so much more universal (including boosting your immune system and thereby preventing cancer and wrinkly skin!)<p>Oh well.<p>Thanks for the link anyway :)",1334052003

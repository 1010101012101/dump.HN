9771209,comment,9770017,9770830,0,0,fnordfnordfnord,,,"I once worked for a guy once who claimed he could sole-source a peanut if he had to. Many of them boiled down to colluding with the supplier to find a set of properties that were unique to their particular peanuts; things like soil pH, average temperature of the area they were grown in, not too much rainfall, not too little rainfall. Most purchasers were neither educated sufficiently to question these kinds of specifications, nor were they particularly interested; they also wanted to find the path of least resistance through the process. We probably could have bought most anything we wanted. Later we had a DOE grant get audited and there was some nervousness on our parts about some of these shenanigans that might be found. The guy just chuckled and said nearly everyone has to play this game to some extent. His major complaint about our books was that our overhead costs were above average, and he helped us make a case to the Uni for lowering it. Didn&#x27;t see that one coming.<p>For an item like chalk though, my employer now has an arrangement with one of the big office-supply companies who specialize in tolerating (and charging extra for) gov&#x27;t nonsense. Lately it&#x27;s been CDW-G, I think. They provide a walled garden of approved products (which don&#x27;t include the kind of good quality chalk in question) and a semi-streamlined purchasing process. It works great for the purchasing dep&#x27;t, I&#x27;m sure, but it sucks for end-users because it introduces the same kind of uncertainty that a purchasing organization is supposed to fix. For example, the prices quoted on the website are not the actual prices of the products, and the products have variable discounts; this and the latency inherent in dealing with the purchasing process makes budgeting and price-shopping difficult to impossible. In my very small dep&#x27;t we usually have budget projections rounded to the nearest hundred even for small items like chalk/dry erase markers because doing otherwise is a waste of time. We spent a lot of time a few years ago, working around the purchasing system just trying to get decent chalk before fatigue eventually set in and we just gave up and installed whiteboards.",1435150790

Logical or predictable methods will always result in logical and predictable music. Its all about setting up code environments so that you can generate accidents and mutations and capture them. Its all about reacting and capturing it and putting it on wax (historically speaking).<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean that a computer can understand why or even recommend what is amazing. We humans don&#x27;t even know why some things are so great.

The public debate in elections may make the biggest noise about undocumented immigrants, but there is behind-the-scenes discussion about the H1-B and L-1 system. This August, the USCIS will announce its decision on expanding the L-1 definition of &quot;specialized knowledge&quot;. The L-1 class, the lesser-known brother of the H1-B, is a 3-year non-immigrant visa that is extendable for up to 5 years (7 years for the L-1A) and can be reissued if the employee in question leaves the US and works for the sponsoring company for another year. People are eligible to apply for the L-1 if they have worked for a US company abroad or will be opening and running US-branch office for a foreign company (other cases apply, just not available off the top of my head. The L-1A is for execs and managers, the L1-B for specialized knowledge workers). No degree or education requirement is necessary for the L-1B by the way. No quota either, like with the H-1B. About a third of applications are rejected though, biased towards India. Abusers of the H1-B and L-1 system are the blue-chip, non-tech companies who use out-sourcing IT companies like Cognizant, Infosys, Tata, Wipro to cut costs in their tech departments. Talking about immigration reform is not so much about lack of incentive as it is about the emotions arising from the stories of Disney IT workers being fired and having to retrain their H1-B replacements who are getting paid lower wages. Another aspect not discussed is whether expanding the H1-B system perpetuates ageism in the Valley -- why not push out older workers at the expense of getting fresh foreign grads? No large change can happen when fear is present.",1435149661

Of course, it wasn&#x27;t made to compile software or run complex simulations, and it has some thermal throttling (my tablet has no fans and this stick doesn&#x27;t appear to have any, either), so if you use the four cores to the maximum for some time, the speed will start decreasing from 1.56 GHz (I have made the max go as low as 0.96 GHz due to throttling). This is the kind of thing that doesn&#x27;t show in all benchmarks, so beware. (To be fair, spec sheets also don&#x27;t say that when cores are not fully used, turboboost kicks in and a single core can be working at 1.8 GHz for quite some time).<p>The integrated Intel graphics are (as usual) good for media playing, web browsing and dealing with Windows UI animations, but forget any kind of gaming that demands more than a smartphone game.<p>The biggest problem, for me at least, is the lack of RAM: 2 GB of RAM are filled quite fast with 6-8 Chrome tabs and some background software open. It also doesn&#x27;t take much to fill the whole 4 GB of commit space, and of course, bringing pages in and out of the pagefile is quite slow (the storage is flash, but not quite a SSD). It is easy to make Windows show a &quot;system running low on memory&quot; message just by opening 20 Chrome tabs, some with heavy sites. If all you want to do is run Microsoft Office, I found it to actually be much lighter on memory use than I previously thought (I never saw OneNote, Excel or Word go beyond 90 MB).<p>Storage gets quite full very easily, mine is always with ~1 GB free (Windows and Office installed on C:, most other things installed on the SD card), and this is using things like NTFS compression. If this stick is like my tablet, it will have 6 GB of storage &quot;wasted&quot; on a recovery partition. Also, the trick Microsoft recommends OEMs use for fitting Windows on systems with as few as 16 GB of storage, which consists on using WIM images for storing the system files, works only while the install is fresh: as more and more system updates are installed, the altered files seem to be stored out of the image, which means there&#x27;s effectively more space used with Windows files than with a normal install. I have &quot;reserved&quot; the Windows 10 update and I&#x27;m eager to see how it will deal with background-downloading the (possibly gigabytes) of files into a system with only 1 GB free.<p>I once thought of installing Visual Studio just to see how slow it would run, but gave up once I understood most components must be installed to C: (it appears that installing VS effectively equates to &quot;extending Windows&quot; with developer tools).<p>I am still quite happy with the purchase (it was about $150) since it allows for doing things Android tablets don&#x27;t do, like running the full MS Office or using proper desktop versions of browsers and other software.

Those people, educated in subjects not open to the commoners, and at additional expense, then have an advantage when applying for a place an Oxford/Cambridge on the classics courses. Those courses then take in a disproportionate number of upper class students. Thus, the British class system is continued and reinforced by those universities that have been criticized in the past for not taking enough commoners.<p>Ie, they form a club based on talking dead languages no-one else understands and use Greek/Latin as a qualification for being included in the club, as well as where you were educated.<p>Class is very much a thing in the UK in certain circles.

I think people who believe in christian values are afraid of stating those views publicly because in the US there is a bad history of christian fundamentalists (ie Moral Majority) who fanatically attack people who do not ascribe to christian moral values. Despite a high percentage of people in the US who profess to be christians, the US has one of the highest divorce rates in the world. A lot of people see the christian concept of family unit as basically flawed, we live in a culture where divorce and single parents are the norm. There is also the issue of separation of church and state when dealing with family values. So I think a lot of people who are in position of authority are afraid of publicly stating their personal christian beliefs because christian values seem to be so out of touch with what is actually going on. Indeed it is not morally right nor is it lawful to force religious beliefs on someone. But we still have a right to have moral beliefs that we use to help form our decisions. In my view Brendan appeared to back down from openly stating what his personal beliefs are on the matter and to fall back on the idea that he supports anti-discrimination laws (that include discrimination on the basis of sexual preference). I think its possible to have moral convictions based on religion and vote in ways that support those convictions. This is not discrimination, there is no &#x27;ultimate moral code&#x27; that transcends all laws or religious beliefs. In the end all laws and moral codes must come from somewhere. These laws must be fair and not tied to any religion or moral code but must be voted on democratically. Brendan backed down from explaining why he holds such beliefs. This sort of makes him a coward and someone who is afraid to speak on what he personally believes to be true because of fear he will be seen as intolerant.",1435147249

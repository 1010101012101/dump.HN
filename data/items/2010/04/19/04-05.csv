If your main competitor offers a Windows stack, why risk going with something else? I do agree with you to the extent that it all started with their landmark IBM deal. In today's landscape, why would HTC or Motorola or some other hardware maker risk developing their own stack and maintaining it when everyone else seems to be offering Android?

And I don't think it's fair to lump all this together into an amorphous concept of ""Linux"" when the problem is a bit more nuanced.<p>Linux, as a kernel and as a platform, has matured, but there's still plenty of opportunity for new people to explore new territory.  Some of it may be extending the existing ""boring"" infrastructure, which the author seems to blame for turning developers away, but nobody should feel restricted to working on those things.  There's still a lot of exciting application development to be done, and as an added bonus, if the platform needs improvements to support your application, you're encouraged to contribute those as well.<p>Also, if you want a counterpoint, the Arch Linux developers page certainly makes me feel old already: <a href=""http://www.archlinux.org/developers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archlinux.org/developers/</a>",1271651457

As someone else pointed out in this thread, while Microsoft did indeed supply the hardware makers with an OS, they very quickly made sure it was the <i>only</i> OS those hardware makers would be able to sell. Also, my understanding is that the Mac OS was let stagnate in the 90's and that most people actually thought Windows was a superior choice anyway.<p>Is it really the case that Android is the only option at this point for hardware makers who are not Apple? That seems silly to me. The other choice is to compete with Apple by building the whole stack. My worry is that Palm's apparent failure is going to put the rest of the industry off of the idea. It doesn't seem ridiculous to me for a company like HTC or Motorola to either buy Palm or start from scratch on their own OS so that they actually have something to sell their product with instead of just selling yet another android touchscreen device.

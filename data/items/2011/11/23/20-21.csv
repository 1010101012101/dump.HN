You just need to create a new ad group, and use ""managed placements"" to specify the sites you want to target.<p>Since you probably don't want 100 ad groups, you have to get a bit more generic with your ads, but there are plenty of ways to do that and still get the ""this is useful information, not some off-topic ad"" effect.<p>Here's another tip: Once you have an ad that exceeds about 0.2% CTR, you'll often get much lower cost-per-click by switching the campaign to CPM bidding.<p>For example, if you're bidding $1 CPM, and getting a 2% CTR, your effective CPC is only $0.05! In CPC mode, you'd often have to bid $0.30 CPC just to show up.",1322081991

As far as any user is concerned, the only actions of theirs that matter are whether they pay their bill and whether they set off the ISP's hassle-this-user system. I'm sure many ISPs have clauses about multiple devices, running ""servers"", piracy, business use, wifi, swearing/offending people, etc. But the only time they even come close to mattering is when the ISP is the target of a legal attack.",1322081874

3271684,comment,3270938,3271216,7,0,beloch,,,"Electrical signals are actually more like waves in water.  A conductor contains many loose electrons that behave like the water.  Sending an electrical signal is like one person dropping a rock at one end of a glassy lake and another person watching for ripples at the other end.  The signal gets through pretty fast, but all that motion dissipates a lot of energy.  This is why wires heat up when you put current through them.  Electrons moving about = heat.<p>Photons do not require a medium to propagate through.  They go through vacuum just fine (while electrical signals don't).  Photons are incredibly good at traveling vast distances without interacting with matter.  If we can see a star in the sky that is a billion light-years away, that's because at least some of the photons emitted by that star have traveled that distance without being absorbed by anything other than the rods and cones in your eye.",1322081779

3271592,comment,3271006,3271441,6,0,aamar,,,"A good and fair question.<p>Generally telling the truth to strangers strengthens society. If someone chooses to lie to strangers, society properly should brand that person as not worthy of business and maybe worth imprisoning for fraud. Because future lies are potentially costly, it makes sense for us to watch for (and sometimes punish) lies harshly even when that lie is itself not very costly.<p>Beyond the straightforward definition of truth though is a larger concept of integrity which means, roughly, that what you say and what you do together form a meaningful ""whole."" For example, many people believe movies can have artistic integrity--such a movie displays the filmmakers' best guess as to the meaningful truth of its situations. If they were paid to use Coca-Cola or to show the can in a particular way, then the movie doesn't have that integrity, and we maybe should be skeptical of their commitment to the truth generally.<p>Similarly, sites such as BusyTeacher implicitly purport to rank results in some ""honest"" (even if not transparent) way. If a particular product, in their honest assessment, should be number 3 and should show that information and should take up that amount of screen real estate, then Patrick wouldn't have to pay for the ad -- the same info would be there organically. If they are showing a paid ad but marking it very clearly as such--there's integrity in that as well. But if they are showing the ad in a way that is misleading, even if only at a glance, then they are compromising their integrity. By the way, to my eye the Google ad looks like an ad at a glance, while the BusyTeacher ad looks like a listing at a glance, but others might disagree, so I'm not really trying to weigh in on the ad itself, just why it <i>might, in theory,</i> be bad.<p>So although this may be ""bad behavior"" I also think the costs are small. The advertiser profits, the site profits but loses their integrity (which they probably don't much value), the users are somewhat misled (those who bounce are somewhat harmed; those who end up purchasing are probably not harmed). But in a broader sense, I do think that our community is improved by generally encouraging and helping each other be honest, especially those we do business with (even if it's only an arms-length advertising arrangement).",1322080208

I can even tell me phone to only allow a short list of numbers to make my phone ring.<p>On the other hand, going to a web site means I want something from them, and their analytics are part of what they take as compensation.<p>You argue, I believe, that ""going to the mall"" becomes similar to ""going to a web site."" By picking up my prescription at the mall pharmacy, I implicitly grant the mall and (I presume) other stores in the mall knowledge about where I go. I suppose the same would apply if my hypothetical daughter went to a Planned Parenthood office in a shopping center.<p>And in some sense, you are right. They already track us, with cameras, with staff, and even with consultant anthropologists. The issues are: how much tracking is appropriate (""retail vs. wholesale surveillance"" as Schneier terms it). What are the social tradeoffs, especially when there might be no real alternative to using one of the stores in the mall. (And why do so many stores ban photography while asserting the right to photograph us?)<p>But they don't track us with the devices we use to contact others, who have nothing to do with the store. That would be (to use yet another analogy) like a web site asking you to install a plug-in ""for great discounts!!!"" but which also tracks all others sites you visit? (Presume that that tracking is mentioned in the fine print.)<p>In your analogy, is ""the mall"" really like ""a web site"" or like a ""web hosting company""? I go to a mall to visit stores, and don't care so much about the mall itself. So ""the mall"" would be the ""web hosting company"", and the individual stores correspond to a web site? As someone who has a hosted web site, I would be uncomfortable if my hosting company started doing per-person/per-page traffic analysis other than what I've set up for my own use, and would really not like it if they shared that information with other web sites also hosted by the same company.<p>Of course, some hosting sites might do this, but in the physical world it's harder for a store to leave the mall if it feels like the mall is doing the wrong thing.<p>So while you can make the analogy, it doesn't feel like a strong one. Why not just argue this case without analogies?",1322079692

Let's say it's a pretty obvious idea that's almost fully formed, like ""let's wrap a web form around OpenSSL so the support techs can make certificate requests"".  That comes together as a couple of blocks in my head.<p>One block is ""have a basic FORM as the UI"" - basic HTML, no big deal, easily done.  The second block is ""have something to handle the incoming POST data"" - libraries I had already written, so again, no big deal.<p>The third block was ""somehow pass it to OpenSSL and get back the data"".  This is where all of the unknowns lurked.  I had to actually play with it to see if it had a reasonable way to be controlled by another program.  It turned out that it could be done without too much trouble, and with that known, the third block was considered possible.<p>Finally, the fourth block would be to take the results and render them on the page returned by the POST handler.  That's just a bit of HTML and other CGI magic - easy enough.<p>When the idea first comes to me, 1, 2, and 4 are fully-formed in my head, and 3 needs elaboration.  A few minutes of poking on 3 convinces me it's possible, and thus with everything seeming reasonable, I start in on it.<p>Total time elapsed from ""hey, we need this"" to ""hey you, try this thing I just wrote"" was about 25 minutes.  I only know this because it happened with a nicely timestamped chat log, and I worked backwards to figure it out.<p>That's not quite an answer to ""how long until first line of code"", but it does give you a window: under 30 minutes, if it's a situation like this.<p>As for the tools, back then: C, pico/nano, home-brewed CGI helper libraries, Linux, Apache.<p>These days, it's the same, only with (a specific subset of) C++ in place of C.  I can elaborate on which bits if you really care.  Use whatever language works for you.<p>Workflow is basically this: open two xterms or similar.  Open an editor in the top one, write code.  Open bottom one, use it to ""make && ./prog"".  Open other windows as necessary for research or experimentation (like fiddling with the OpenSSL stdin hookup, reading man pages, etc).<p>The whole workspace (fluxbox) is nothing but terminals.

They really they pay more but right now not really able to do so again. I have a kid on the way (found out 10 minutes ago that it's a boy!!!)<p>b) I have thought about setting my own shop, but between finding clients, supporting a house and taxes, it has been hard. Things should change beginning next year as I'll move to my own products or freelancing full time.<p>c) About opensource and github, inspired by some comments, I opensourced (MIT license) an old Mockup tool I was making for Mac before being hired.

Need to update the resume as well.<p>e) Again, to all other posters, thanks so much for the info and suggestions.

3271504,comment,3270768,3271240,3,0,tikhonj,,,"JavaScript isn't a special ""browser-only"" language. It's just a normal interpreted, dynamically typed language (much like Python or Ruby) that just happens to run in all browsers. Right now it also happens to be quite a bit faster than Python or Ruby (as far as I know) and is also extremely expressive and flexible.<p>The fact that Python has ""a wealth of libraries"" isn't particularly pertinent--web apps mostly need web-specific libraries, which Python doesn't have (because it isn't in the browser). Most people using JavaScript get by with jQuery, maybe some web ui framework and perhaps something like Raphael. And, with the advent of node and server-side JavaScript, JavaScript is getting more and more libraries outside of the browser as well.<p>Of course, the browsers could support a bunch of different languages, but I think the complexity outweighs the (limited) benefits. Google, obviously, disagrees and thinks that Dart should also be an option, but I really think it isn't worth the effort.<p>Ultimately, JavaScript is more than good enough as a browser language; while it does have some annoying quirks, upcoming versions (and things like ""use strict"") are getting rid of most of them. There really is no overwhelming reason to switch away from JavaScript, and even just adding another language is probably not worth it.",1322079038

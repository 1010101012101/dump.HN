My program was only a few hundred lines long, a toy, but I for the first time had to turn pagination on in gdb to view my program's stacktrace because the it filled two entire screens! Even worse, compile times on my program were ridiculously high and I was wasting a ton of my time in long compile-run feedback cycles. Eventually I threw my hands up in disgust and started hand-rolling my own structs. Compile times dropped to under a second and I was able to easily spot my mistakes in the debugger.<p>What was I doing? I was just writing a simple program to try to understand Boost's spirit parser, somewhat of a monstrosity in its own right, and thought I'd use the lambda library along with it. While we're on the subject of crazy DSL's in C++ templates, I ended up concluding that Flex together with Bison or Lemon are much more pleasant to use than Spirit if you don't need a full recursive descent parser.<p>Using C++ templates to implement crazy meta-languages might seem like a cool idea, and it is, but in practice I've found it to mostly be a waste of time and very unproductive.",1271184827

1262885,comment,1261697,1262381,0,0,mononcqc,,,"The advantages of Erlang are not limited to distribution, but also excellent concurrency. By this, I don't necessarily mean high throughput and amount of queries served per second, but a general resilience over high loads.<p>Because every task can be broken into bits running concurrently (note: not necessarily in parallel, just concurrently) and because the Erlang VM has full control of the runtime, there is a general good load balancing where the applications remain responsive (although slower) over high load, rather than just dropping calls.<p>Another part comes from the high reliability. Of course a broken app is annoying. Fortunately, there are a lot of technologies with stuff like load balancers and whatnot that make it easy to scale in any language and deploy new releases without downtime no matter the kind of code you use. By doing this, the burden of high reliability and scalability is often moved to the database layer. An Erlang web app won't shine that much from this perspective -- the DB might do the heavy lifting.<p>However, the way exceptions are handled with Erlang and its supervision trees changes the way you write programs. You only program for the cases you know how to handle. For the others, you ""let it crash."" This is a bit weird at first, but what this really means is ""only fix the errors you know how to fix"" -- the runtime is made to support living with the other kind of errors.<p>The other aspect of using concurrent actors to do error management is that it shifts the perspective of where exceptions are to be handled.  In most languages, exceptions are managed from within the execution flow of the program:<p><pre><code>               main
        (top level try catch)
                |
            some code
        (might catch errors)
                |
          deeper calls with
         own error management
</code></pre>
The problem with this is that your regular code needs to handle outstanding errors on every level or you just delegate the burden of making things safe to the layer above until you end up having the eternal top-level try catch (it's more complex than that obviously). Erlang supports this model too. However, it also supports supervision trees, which change the structure in the following way:<p><pre><code>     some actor   ------------------- supervisor
           |                                     > supervisor
       some code  <--> other actor -- supervisor
           |               |
     deeper calls      more calls
</code></pre>
(I hope the drawings are clear)<p>Here what I mean to illustrate is that actors who run code are being supervised by other concurrent 'supervisor' actors who are dedicated to handling errors that won't be handled by 'worker' actors. They can restart dead workers, notify the user or a logging system of a problem, propagate the killing of workers to dependent ones, etc.<p>This means the burden of error handling is shifted from within your standard and correct execution path to a concept litterally parallel to it. This lets you organize your code towards non-defensive programming while keeping it more stable at the same time.<p>This is not to say standard exceptions are not the way. They're still pretty useful. However, there is more than one class of error that can happen in software, and I think Erlang deals with this beautifully.<p>In my opinion, this concept of supervision trees is what Erlang really is about. People come in for the concurrency, but they stay for the supervision trees.",1271182999

I don't know that everyone can program computers, and it's quite possible that many people cannot.<p>Observe: some people cannot, as programming requires intelligence and some people are in fact no more intelligent than vegetables, usually due to brain damage. If we progress further we have people that are capable of simple thought, but cannot even recognize themselves in the mirror. Somewhere down the line of progression (since we cannot really rank intelligence, let's assume we are progressing in whatever ""direction"" of intelligence leads to the ability to program [if there is more than one, pick one arbitrarily]) we can choose a brain which gives people the ability to construct rudimentary programs. I admit the line here is extremely fuzzy, because programs can vary in complexity: the least you need is to be able to remember two words: ""print 'hi'"". At this point our knowledge goes to hell, it's not really clear what functions of our minds are necessary to construct and understand varying levels of program complexity, or whether anything special is required at all. Simple statements like ""everybody can program"", or ""only some can program"" gloss over extremely complicated neurological (possibly psychological, as well) issues that won't be resolved for some time, and have no known answer.<p>We may believe it to be true, but I would say such a belief is <i>heavily</i> influenced by our own experiences, as well as our own socialization with people that share that experience. We can program, why couldn't others? It's tempting to believe that because it was true for us it's true for everyone, but sadly (or not so sadly) this really isn't always true.

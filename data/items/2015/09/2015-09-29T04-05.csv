10294715,comment,10291070,10291070,0,0,bouyoul420,,,"This happens with registered hotels and Expedia too. I had to be in Paris for a few days a couple of years ago so I chose a nice hotel on Expedia, and not very expensive as well. However, when I showed up, the hotel had no trace of the reservation. The manager didn&#x27;t want to call Expedia because it would not change anything (no space left, he claimed). Instead, he very nicely called another hotel to find space for me. I even thanked him... However, the other hotel was the shittiest hotel I have ever stayed at and would probably not have survived a listing on the Internet. The manager there was crazy and the hotel was so bad they couldn&#x27;t even manage to track which rooms were occupied by guests. And since it was a walk-in, I paid super high rates. While staying at that hotel, I heard multiple guests with the same story as me so it was not an isolated technical problem on the part of the local hotels (seems more than one hotel was in on it). When I complained to Expedia, it turned out the first hotel had cancelled the reservation right before I showed up so no foul for them (despite my never being told about it before showing up at the hotel). Expedia gave me a voucher in the end but the listing for that hotel stayed on the site.",1443502559
10294714,comment,10286724,10287555,0,0,kbenson,,,"> We can see something similar in languages like Ruby or Perl, where it&#x27;s actually kind of nice that you don&#x27;t have to worry about whether a variable holds a string or integer or whatever. (For some reason, Javascript&#x27;s implementation of the same idea seems to be a bit more annoying, but that could just be me).<p>Well, for Perl that&#x27;s likely because the conversion of the variable to the desired type is controlled by the operator, and as such they make distinctions between operators that work on numeric types (the usual assortment, +,-,/,*,==,!=,<,>,<=,>= etc) and those that work on strings (&quot;.&quot;,x,eq,ne,lt,gt,le,ge, etc).  This makes the intended operation obvious, so explicit casting between types is often not required.<p>For example, in JS, what is the following doing?  String concatenation or addition?  What if the types are mixed?<p><pre><code>    var c = a + b;
</code></pre>
In Perl, the equivalent is one of the following, depending on your purpose.<p><pre><code>    my $c = $a + $b; # Addition
    my $c = $a . $b; # Concatenation
</code></pre>
Note there is no ambiguity. If warnings are enabled, if a string can&#x27;t be cleanly converted to a numeric type, it will report as much on STDERR.  This all stems from a core tenet of Perl, similar things should look similar, different things should look different.  String concatenation and addition aren&#x27;t really similar, as much as they may seem like it at first blush (for example, concatenation is not commutative).<p>As for Ruby...  I don&#x27;t know.  It uses + for string concatenation (but also concat, I believe).  I suspect having actual methods to disambiguate intention helps for Ruby.",1443502543

FB allow targeting in minimum groups of ten emails at a time. For large companies it&#x27;s easy enough to batch data groups of 10  for things like happy b&#x27;day or &#x27;Hello George&#x27; type messages. Or to take it to the 1-1 level there was an amusing case of someone trolling their flatmate by uploading 10 email addresses, nine of which were girls and selecting the sub-targeting option of &#x27;male only&#x27;. He then ran super personal ads to freak out his flatmate. FB may have fixed this 1-1 option now given the publicity.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t do these type of comms in my marketing as people find it creepy. Nor have I seen other utilising this like that. I have used FB for targeting with generic ads so people don&#x27;t realise they are being targeted at that level. It was quite effective. End of the day professional marketers are trying to get relevant ads in-front of relevant users and not waste budget with unneeded impressions/clicks.<p>All that said, I do see the potential for abuse on this. I kinda feel regulators need to step in and place clear guidelines for people protection, perhaps rules around PII (personally identifiable information) sharing between organisation which is getting very common these days to enrich each others data. Also in the same way many professionals are accredited, I wonder if people working across larger PII data sets should require accreditation. Something that ensures they know the rules, and if they are abused they can be removed from the industry.",1443502107

There are plenty of hardcore functional programmers who will argue that strict by default and lazy by choice is the preferable option.<p>The reason Kotlin sequence operations aren&#x27;t lazy by default is probably because Java collections aren&#x27;t, and Kotlin code is going to spend a lot of time dealing with Java collections.

No company is ever going to reject you because you didn&#x27;t tell them your current salary. So just politely tell the recruiter that you don&#x27;t want to reveal it. If they insist, just tell them what your salary expectation is (this should give them an idea of what kind of offer you&#x27;d be willing to accept which is all they should care about).",1443500070

That way they already like me, they&#x27;ve gone through the process, and they are willing to try to meet me somewhere reasonable. So you&#x27;re already a step ahead of the game in that sense.<p>I&#x27;ve used something to the effect of &quot;I&#x27;m sure you have a range in mind for this position that&#x27;s commensurate with fair market rates. And I&#x27;m willing to be a team player and probably meet you somewhere along those lines. Can you tell me roughly what you&#x27;re targeting for this role?&quot;<p>Most recruiters will be fairly candid with you. They&#x27;ll offer something at the lower to mid range of the target band. At least that&#x27;ll be a ballpark. From there, you need to decide if it&#x27;s worth pursuing the process based on whether you&#x27;d be happy accepting what they told you + whatever you might be able to negotiate on top of it.<p>The downside to this approach is that you allow them to anchor [2], in other words, your continuation of the process implies an inherent acceptance of the reasonableness of what they quote you. (And this is Google, after all, so they are likely to suggest something pretty reasonable in the first place.)<p>There is no upside to quoting your current salary, and it is almost never a dealbreaker if you punt on answering.<p>[1] BATNA = Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. In simple terms, this is your fallback option. The best fallback option is the strongest market price you can get independent of this offer. This isn&#x27;t an invitation to shop an offer you receive, but rather, an establishment of your market value. A soft offer from another firm, ideally prior to going down the line with Google, is a form of BATNA. If you have no other options at the moment, then your current salary becomes your BATNA by default.<p>[2] An anchor is a frame of reference established by the first person to throw out a number. A ballsy approach would be to anchor high right off the bat. Sometimes this works. Sometimes it backfires. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest a bold anchor unless you know what you&#x27;re doing. I also would caution against a high anchor if you know it&#x27;s unreasonable relative to your best guess at the band this position occupies.",1443499268

It was stripped, and the educated people moved outward, long ago.<p>I worked at the Madison Building downtown while rapt.fm was part of the Bizdom accelerator program so I saw a lot of this gentrifying effect happening.<p>Dan Gilbert / Detroit Venture Partners / Bizdom have been establishing a tech ecosystem to help with the revitalization downtown. There were dozens of small companies at the Madison Building, a really nice place to have events on the rooftop, an auditorium, etc. And the urban area right around it has a lot of great restaurants and places to live.<p>This startup scene was moderately big, but way, way bigger was the moving of Quicken Loans back downtown. Plus the updating of the sports stadiums. Plus the general hipsters from UMich building interesting stuff throughout the region. Plus the huge bailout of GM and other kinds of Federal support of industry in Michigan during the Great R.<p>All of that is why Detroit&#x27;s collapse is in the past tense, not to say that it is in good shape or anything.<p>It was an interesting situation on the ground, it had the feel of re-taking, re-building, re-connecting. Downtown and the Wayne State area were way better off than the rest of town, in a highly visible way. But all kinds of folks who held on through the real decline were around, with stories to tell.<p>One key thing that happened while I was there, and this is was the intention of key people at Bizdom I believe, was that business connected quite a bit with the outer community (i.e. across the freeway-moat around the gentrifying downtown). Lots of people got involved with the startups in the Madison, and were often introduced to us by Bizdom&#x27;s leaders.<p>Our company, which combined freestyle rap music with real-time web technology, collaborated with maybe a dozen or two people from around the area. Some were graphic designers, techies, or artists, others were local rappers or promoters.<p>The town&#x27;s presence was constant, it was there in the huge windows. You could drive down any major stretch at night, and randomly take a right into a post-industrial wasteland. A kid might zip by on a bike in the pitch dark. Because everywhere, nearby, there were also some homes with families inside.<p>I can&#x27;t even describe how much city there is, outside of downtown. Miles of infrastructure basically sits fallow or highly depreciated, and thousands mire in poverty, due to poor urban design, poor leadership, and historic fear.<p>By hosting companies that draw from Detroit&#x27;s huge creative energy and then bringing tech and business people to the core of the city, Gilbert will have a major positive effect in the long run.<p>Call this effect gentrification while the city collapses, but you can also call it the shaky beginnings of a return to normalcy.",1443499263

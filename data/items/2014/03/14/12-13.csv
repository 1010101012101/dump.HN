We never change the published interface so that if you&#x27;re getting some board fields that will always work. This means that we don&#x27;t change the types of fields (for example string vs object) or the names of fields since that changes the published service contract.<p>What we do instead is add more fields. A very good example of this is emoji. We added emoji support a while back and instead of changing the &quot;text&quot; fields to be objects or embedding HTML (gah) into them we added another field called &quot;textData&quot; that has the extra info.<p>This is copy/pasted from an actual call for getting card actions:<p><pre><code>        &quot;textData&quot;: {\n          &quot;emoji&quot;: {\n            &quot;daft&quot;: &quot;https://trello-emoji.s3.amazonaws.com/4f820a995a03e8e82d134ac4/ae846ca70bf7aa95dd3330b8fd1c70cb/art-daft-punk-steampunk-951631.gif&quot;\n          }\n        },\n        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Custom emoji! :daft:&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis may not be sustainable in the long term and if it&#x27;s not we&#x27;ll version the API if we have to at that point.

One is meant for concurrent access by multiple threads - and thus synchronizes the access, while the other one is not thread safe and should not be used where this is a requirement. If you want the best of both, use ConcurrentHashMap.<p>There is a concept of a shared resource, e.g. a cache of computed values. A shared resource will necessarily be subject to concurrent modification, and thus requires synchronization. The point is, depending of the situation shared resources may far outweigh the cost of synchronization. These are tools, understand them and use them where they makes sense.",1394801655

7398372,comment,7397253,7397253,7,0,danbruc,,,"While all theory sounds nice in theory in practice it just fails. If you are only concerned with empty databases during development there is not much to be gained by keeping deltas of different database schema versions - just having one evolving database create script will do the job. Then just grab the version belonging to your application version and you are good to go. Once you have a non-empty database and have to provide data migration scripts everything becomes a one-way street in all but the most trivial cases because updates are destructive.<p>My favorite toy example are firstname and lastname. If you decide to merge them into a single name column (without separator between firstname and lastname) you can not automatically go back because there is ambiguity when ever either firstname or lastname is missing or when at least one of firstname or lastname consists of two or more words. If you do the opposite - split the name into firstname and lastname - and somehow manage to come up with a satisfying heuristic how to perform the split, it is easy to go back by just merging firstname and lastname again. But then going forward again will not return you to the initial state in all the cases where your heuristic fails.<p>Currently I think the way to go may be using a highly normalized database schema - like 5th or 6th normal form - and perform only non-destructive schema evolution. I am not yet sure how this will turn out in practice with respect to limitations imposed on the possibilities to evolve the schema and how bad it may become because of abandoned database schema artifacts and the contained data. Anyway I think it looks promising and after doing some more research, thinking and prototyping I will most likely give it a try in an upcoming project.",1394801392

I did not care about what was hip, I cared about what would work using my limited resources. With that goal in mind I have spent my time practicing, testing and analysing most of the popular languages and related frameworks from asp.net, php, python, ruby and so on, and from my beginners perspective (which is a important market to serve) node is on another level. I&#x27;m fairly confident it is one of those big leaps forward like rails was and will be around a very long time.<p>Why? In one word I&#x27;d say its speed. Its freaking fast and I&#x27;m not just talking about io performance, thats just the icing on the cake. Learning curve, development time, configuration, all extremely quick and easy.<p>One thing I think people forget or don&#x27;t put enough emphasis on is that node is a networking library, its not just server side JS the way that asp.net is server side C#, its JavaScript from the bottom to the top. Web server, load balancing, pretty much anything you need can be written in just JS. That makes it extremely easy to set up your own stack that you actually have the potential to comprehend or even write yourself and launch something on the cheap. For 5 bucks on digital ocean you can set up a node app that will probably scale enough to survive a slashdot effect or launch a mvp.<p>Node and its related frameworks still have a ways to go but I think it is a mistake to dismiss it. And finally I&#x27;d like to mention that its first release was 2009 and people have been talking about it a lot ever since. I think its already passed the trendy technology phase and will continue to see widespread adoption.",1394799463

It does take some getting used to, and there&#x27;s a few ways you can get yourself a little bit stuck during development, like when you realize a change you&#x27;ve just applied is wrong, and you dive into the changelog or source files to fix it <i>BEFORE</i> you&#x27;ve asked liquibase to roll back the bad change. Then, when you finally remember to roll back the bad change, liquibase refuses because you&#x27;ve edited the change&#x27;s definition, and it no longer corresponds to what was actually applied to the database. It&#x27;s not a very big deal, and if you have more presence of mind than me you might learn not to trip yourself up in that particular way in the first place.<p>In my job I really struggle with getting meaningful test data, and so having the ability to clone the live database and let liquibase roll forward with new changes from a dev branch, try things out, roll back, tweak things and roll forward again is very handy.<p>Also if you&#x27;re maintaining a large number of stored procedures, it&#x27;s very handy to keep each of them in a separate file and reference them from your changelog something like: <sqlFile path=&quot;...&quot; runOnChange=&quot;true&quot;/>  -  the runOnChange property means that whenever the contents of the file is changed liquibase will automatically reload the procedure. (Though for example, postgres will complain if the change alters the type signature of a function.)<p>I&#x27;d recommend using the XML config format (though JSON and YAML are also supported), and use an editor that understands XML schemas. Probably any of the free Jetbrains ones will, certainly PyCharm does. Load the XML schema definitions into the project settings, and you&#x27;ll get syntax autocompletion and validation for your liquibase changelog files.",1394799290

It&#x27;s far worse to drive 35 mph on a city street in Manhattan than 90 mph (assuming no or low traffic) on the highway. The first is &quot;only 5 over&quot; (the NYC speed limit is 30, which is way too high) and might get you a small fine; the second can put you in jail, in some states.<p>The issue with cars is that the vehicle that is best for highways (capable of speeds up to at least 80 mph) is not great for city driving. Automatic transmissions make it even worse, because there are now idiots who have no idea how fast they&#x27;re driving (yeah, I&#x27;m a stick snob).<p>Second, the car did a great job of something in the 1950s. It was a rent/house-price control mechanism that actually worked-- without causing a shortage. It scaled back the power of landlords by allowing development of low-value land. Suburbia turned into something ugly-- racist, detached, gluttonous, environmentally harmful, and ultimately (paradoxically?) expensive-- for a variety of reasons, including increased specialization in the economy (more driving, more scaling problems with traffic) and a Parkinson&#x27;s Law effect of consumer capitalism. Isolated people turned out to be <i>more</i> needy, confused, and liable to overspend, making a market for gigantic houses, ridiculous cars, and tons of low-quality consumer dreck (bought on credit) that no one really needed. Slowly, the tyranny of the landlords crept back in, and things people actually needed (healthcare, education, and finally housing) became again expensive, then extortionate. That&#x27;s where we are now.<p>The car is actually a huge money-hole for most working families, and auto loans a &quot;gateway drug&quot; to yet more unnecessary consumer debt. The car was supposed to liberate them from landlords. Now, it&#x27;s a white elephant they can only afford because they have no choice: the jobs are all 10-50 miles away, public transportation is expensive and emasculated in most places-- even Amtrak is unaffordable for most; and the roads are unsafe to bike or walk (highways and ghettos, both products of suburbanization). So people drop hundreds of dollars per month on car payments, fuel, insurance, parking, tolls, and repairs (plus the involuntary payment through taxes, but that could be argued to be a win for most; if you eat, you use the roads). For people out of cities, the car has become the new landlord.<p>In the 1930s to &#x27;50s, however, no one saw all these unintended consequences. Now, it&#x27;s an open question whether the benefits of widespread automobile usage merit the risk to public safety and the slashing of public spaces. I&#x27;d say &quot;no&quot;. On the other hand, if you were a working-class person in the 1940s and this new invention had the promise of liberating you from the landlord so you could send your kids to school and actually retire, you might think differently. They didn&#x27;t have the foresight to see all the negative unintended consequences or car-reliance.",1394798825

Are these FF OS devices really future proof for a while (think &#x27;supported&#x27; upstream, kinda like Nexus devices or fully supported CyanogenMod builds)? Can I follow FF OS without waiting for e.g. ZTE?<p>- Those are low spec devices. I understand that FF OS wants to target the lower end of the market and is supposed to work well in that environment. But is that the case? Will I be able to give these a spin as my primary device for a time?<p>The second issue is lower in priority. Even if these things don&#x27;t allow me to replace my main Android phone, I&#x27;d still love to peek at FF OS and play with the development environment, but a &#x27;daily driver&#x27; would be quite interesting as well..

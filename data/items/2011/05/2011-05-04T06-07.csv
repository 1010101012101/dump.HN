Our systems were more like online banking systems; very much an even split of fast writes and reads, transactionally bound to third party systems (in-game payment, in-game ""real time"" use of consumables, etc), real-time analytics for fraud detection, etc.  We were very much high IO, and our caching opportunitites were few and far between.<p>And in our environment, we HAD to have sophisticated testing.  I ensured that the stress and load testing was done so that we could directly simulate the load of our expected user base, with realistic profiles, in order to better engineer our databases and disk IO.  It also allowed us to measure the impacts of feature additions, etc.  If it failed in Production, it made the news, and we had millions of gamer-freaks bitching everywhere.<p>In my case, the middle-tier was not an issue... we enabled minimal caching on a per-box basis, and other than that, they were stateless, and we could add/remove them at will; the application WAS the database.<p>And you can still abstract various parts of the database while using an ORM.  We did write a few special stored procedures, and used some forced query plans, views, etc., to tweak the performance.<p>And yes, Oracle can scale out quite well.  Cache Fusion, high speed and low latency interconnects, and shared block access provides incredible scaling without having to do anything special in the middle tier.",1304492323

2512990,comment,2511903,2511903,7,0,sigil,,,"Guess I'm a little too young for the 12c. I grew up on the 28S.<p>Concatenative languages like the HP RPN offer a nice gentle introduction to programming. In fact, I'll go further and say they <i>trick you into programming without even realizing it</i>. One minute you're working through a calculation for the Nth time via the same series of button presses, the next minute you're recording those button presses into a new user-defined button, and moving on to some higher level calculation. I've seen people do this and think they're ""just calculating,"" when in fact they're doing bottom-up programming.<p>Here's an example if you're not familiar with HP RPN. Say you're performing a repetitive computation like finding the euclidean mean with X and Y already sitting on the stack. These are the buttons you push:<p><pre><code>  DUP * SWAP DUP * + SQRT
</code></pre>
You can turn this into a program by recording the same set of button presses, then giving it a name:<p><pre><code>  << DUP * SWAP DUP * + SQRT >> 'L2NORM' STO
</code></pre>
On the 28S and later calculators, there's a menu that holds stored programs. Now you just navigate to that menu and hit the button under 'L2NORM'.<p>This natural progression from calculation -> programming is something I miss in other languages. I like the <i>idea</i> of concatenative languages [1] like Factor, Joy and Forth, but hesitate to embark on anything more than trivial programming with them; their terseness can be even more extreme than Lisp's.<p>[1] <a href=""http://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Front%20Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Front%20Page</a>",1304491235

Most of the solution is spoon-fed into the algorithm in the form of the fitness function and the terminals.

That's the naturalist fallacy: implicitly assuming that the 'natural state of affairs' is by definition better than an 'artificially' created situation. Taking a pill is no different from living in a house. Both are unnatural. Both can make life a lot easier.<p>It's also the fallacy of the split middle: it's not either 'you love someone' or 'you can't stand them'. If you're in a loving relationship that has gone downhill somewhat and a few medicated sessions can renew the bonds, is that really any different from going on a second romantic honeymoon, where you also create artificial circumstances to strengthen the bond?

This inference is also consistent with the other case I linked to previously in which someone got a huge bill from them.<p>Had Telstra informed the power company (not the thief!) it undoubtedly would have been caught earlier, when a much smaller sum had been stolen.  Moreover, given that black hats can clone SIMs and such, one might think that consumers should be able to demand reasonable protection from thievery from their telecom provider.<p>Please note that although it's possible that they have a rather long billing period (e.g. they only got bills every few months), such notices would only be useful if they could occur within a billing period, so it still would have helped protect the power company from theft of services.<p>I have no idea how you managed to carefully read any of the comments and still confused the account holder (the power company) with the woman who misused the SIM card, whether you were reading my comments or those of nagrom.",1304489663

It's a shame that it doesn't have better funding.<p>In addition to the tokamak work being done in the EU at CERN, the US has been funding fusion research for years at the NIF. The US system does not use a tokamak (magnetic confinement of a donut of plasma), but instead involves crushing balls of hydrogen with lasers. The US and the EU are currently in competition to see who can get to ""ignition"" first. The NIF is hoping for it to happen in the next 2-3 years.<p>This sounds great and all, but there's at least 10-20 years of work still yet to be done before we can start building commercial fusion power plants. Ignition will be a wonderful ""HEY, IT WOOORRRKSSSSS"" moment, but there are a lot of big unanswered engineering questions looming ahead, such as ""what material do we build the ignition chamber out of that can withstand temperatures high enough to melt salt as well as survive constant neutron bombardment?"" Hopefully ignition, when it happens, will motivate major countries to open their wallets and let pour the funding. We'll see. An appreciable percentage of the US's plasma physicists may retire once the US gets ignition. They have been working on this problem for quite literally their entire careers.",1304488971

If you wrap your query results with objects and maintain an interface into your update statements via method calls (which obviously have type checking for arguments), I don't see how you can run into serious trouble. In the dynamic language world you of course don't have compile time anything, but you can use pretty much the exact same techniques to ensure you don't pass something bad to your query. I guess this isn't very dynamic, but that's the idea - your data access logic lives in the database, you execute methods and get back objects. That's the no orm way.",1304488829

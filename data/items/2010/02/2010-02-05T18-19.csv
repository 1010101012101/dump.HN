1104454,comment,1103910,1103910,0,0,lemming,,,"This article fails to mention the main benefit of final - it gives you much stricter guarantees for concurrency under the Java Memory Model. If you create an immutable object and the fields are final, you can immediately pass the object to another thread without synchronisation - this is not safe if the fields are not final but are otherwise immutable.<p>For this reason we enforce that all object member fields must be final if possible, but we don't enforce it for local variables or method parameters. There are benefits to be had by doing that as well but IMO the benefit outweighs the return (and our IDE, IntelliJ, warns us if we reuse a local variable or method parameter).",1265396344

That's why I pointed out that it's only in the best interest of consumers that the bugs get fixed.<p>It seems that neither Adobe nor Apple actually want to make a good experience for users, flash or otherwise, because independent of whose fault it is the problems are not getting addressed.  I'm reminded of <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html</a>, where Microsoft actually cared about the user experience enough to insert a massive kludge even though the bug wasn't their fault.  And since the problems are not getting addressed, I'd be leery of using either Apple or Adobe products.  Apple because they would rather destroy a product they don't like even though the users do, and Adobe because of the way they treat their products after release.  Apple's defense is that they prefer the new and shiny vs the old and busted (which are subjective measurements).  For years Apple was behind Flash, it was one of the reasons to use a Mac, at least for flash development.  Apple was also behind Firewire for years, it was so much better than USB.  Then all of a sudden it wasn't, much to the detriment of those people who had bought all that highend firewire hardware.  Now, this usually ends up being good for the consumer, which is why Jobs has the reputation he does, and in Apple's defense, their standard MO of controlling the entire platform means they have to make the ""hard"" decisions about what they support, and it usually ends up being good all around, but the transition, when Jobs changes his mind, can be a real bitch.",1265395309

But we do know that a good many such homes are in foreclosure due to official filings, and that a high proportion of those have yet to be brought back to market, plus we can speculate that banks are generally sticking to their policy of not forgiving debt - although they may recover less than the outstanding loan value by selling the house, they don't want to set a precedent of wiping out (say) 25% of the debt on mortgages by mutual agreement, because then everybody will try to take advantage of it, even those who are not yet underwater.<p>Anecdotally, I've been househunting for a few months, and just in the last few weeks I've started getting calls from real estate agents to inform me that the asking price for property X or Y has dropped, and would I care to make an offer? I find this startling - I'm looking around the low end of the market (by San Francisco standards...it's still expensive here) and only a few months ago the typical attitude was 'at this price, everything goes fast - better increase your bid a little if you really want it'. Now I'm getting called at least once a week about 3-5% price cuts.<p>Some of this is doubtless due to the public perception that the first-time homebuyer's tax credit was expiring in November (in fact it was extended to April). But the ratio of new properties on sale to foreclosures has been < 1 for a while now. I think the increasing pain of the commercial real estate market is creating a glut of inventory for banks, which they are increasingly anxious to get off their books.",1265395296

If anything, the gap between condo and house prices in Vancouver is evidence that zoning in other cities is raising prices.

You have no reason, no incentive, to understand and empathize with people different from you.  The essay makes that point with respect to the rich and poor kids in the Breakfast Club, who were at least in the same school, vs. the modern high school in the O.C., where everyone is uniformly spoiled and out of touch with other people's reality.<p>This leads to the increasing political polarization we see today.  A relative handful of people taking society's spoils for itself and isolating themselves from the rest of society.  If unchecked, do you think this will end well?  The end effect is something like the Feudalism rightly decried elsewhere in this thread.",1265392923

Any sufficiently smart person would realize that the media outlets that remain on the air after Chavez' frenzy are the ones that are working aligned with the Government interests.<p>This is just false. Much of the Venezuelan media is extremely hostile to Chavez.

I'll categorize them based on each computer.<p>I'm basing my recommendations on using a 13"" Macbook for the last 3 1/2 years and a 17"" Macbook Pro (from work) for the last couple of months. Also, you might want to hold off a little longer as the Macbook Pro line is due for an update and it might be worth it to see what Apple does to them (<a href=""http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/</a>).<p>13"" Macbook Air<p>-memory capped at 4GB ram\n-1440 display resolution\n-no disc drive<p>The resolution makes this great choice for a portable 13"". But, you don't have a disc drive. You're limited to 4GB RAM and 256GB disk space. If you plan to run any virtual machines or dual boot into Windows - I'd pass on the Air. If you plan to do any work with iMovie and iDVD, that also rules this out with no disk drive (you can buy an external drive). Otherwise, it's a solid choice or portability.<p>------------------------------------------\nThe Macbook Pro line is due for a refresh.<p>13"" Macbook Pro<p>-1280 dispaly resolution<p>This display size is a little small. That being said, I'm curious to see it Apple will upgrade the display when this model is refreshed. I would loved to see this form factor include the 1440 display that is in the MBAir. If you plan to spend a great deal of time working from the same desk and have a decent external display. This with a 27"" Apple display would be a killer combo and I'd prefer it over a 17"" Macbook Pro. But, if you're on the go, I'd pass.<p>15"" Macbook Pro<p>-1440 display resolution (upgradeable to 1680)<p>My next personal MBP would probably be this one with the upgraded display. It's not too big and you've got a decent amount of screen real estate.<p>17"" Macbook Pro<p>-1920 display resolution<p>This one is a little pricey, but at times the resolution is nice when using something like BetterSnapTool or Double Pane to resize windows on the fly to fill half a screen.<p>------------------------------------------<p>CONCLUSION<p>The best all around value is the 15"" Pro (with or without the upgraded display). I would only buy another 13"" if I knew I was going to be stationary (most of the time) and would lean heavily on an external display.",1317653644

Particularly if a library is forcing you to learn about existential types. In Yesod we are very conscientious about what types (even just polymorphism) that is exposed to the user, because they can make error messages, etc difficult.<p>I don't think the Pong benchamark <a href=""http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/preliminary-warp-cross-language...</a>\nis that synthetic - I think it demonstrates concurrency capabilities fairly well. We just have to keep in mind which web applications benefit from high concurrency.<p>As for raw performance of a single request, I agree that the average web application won't see a great difference for the 80% case. However, for most Ruby web applications that I have worked on I have had to spend time re-writing slow parts of the application because Ruby was truly the bottleneck, and I would have been much better off using almost any compiled language with types.<p>Ruby applications I have worked on always have more complicated deployments, worse response times, and huge memory usage due to the lack of async IO. Async IO is possible in Ruby & Python, but it still sucks because it is extra work and you have to always be on guard against blocking IO. So I hope we can at least agree that async IO is a big win, and that Haskell & Erlang are the best at async IO because it is built into the runtime and no callbacks are required. And likewise deployment to multi-core is no extra effort in Haskell/Erlang, whereas in Node, Ruby, or Python you will need to load balance across multiple processes that are using more RAM.",1317652697

The table structures are unnecessarily convoluted.  These applications process client data (eligibility, certifications, enrollment) sometimes in the context of state data.<p>I have built solutions that allow me to collect data from running applications, and later inject data from these collected scenarios into the business logic for testing and debugging.<p>All of this to say that any objective analysis of these systems would reveal no need for a relational database. In fact, imposing the relational transaction model onto these applications is clearly detrimental to the development of these systems, the cost of these systems, the testability of these systems (though this isn't really the fault of the database technology itself), and the performance of these systems.<p>We should be processing the information through an application designed solely according to the needs of the application, and then selective pushing data to a data warehouse for reporting (which can certainly be a relational database).<p>It is almost like Ford claiming all your transportation needs require a truck, and forcing all supermarkets to accommodate driving trucks up and down the grocery aisles...<p>Nobody would say you don't need trucks.

Polymorphism that can only be implemented using existential types plus Typable? Even purity is a double-edged sword (some algorithms are inherently mutable)[1]. Some of Haskell's problems in real-life projects can definitely be attributed to the language itself.<p><i>So the practical reason for using Haskell today is to take advantage of the amazing performance,</i><p>My experience with everything from simple checksum functions to parameter estimators (ML) is that Haskell is generally at least 2-10x slower than C (even when introducing strictness where necessary, unboxing constructors, etc.). So, in practice you'll often end up doing heavy lifting in C anyway (whether it is a database server or a classifier that works in the background), and in the end it doesn't matter so much whether you use Haskell or a dynamic language (performance-wise) if a significant amount of time is required processing requests.<p><i>where its type system can rule out most common web development bugs</i><p>Right, this is where Haskell currently has an edge, because it does not only make it easy to make DSLs (as e.g. Ruby), but typechecks everything as well.<p><i>oh, and Yesod is even faster than the mentioned Snap framework which is already much faster than Node</i><p>Yes, but the benchmarks you implicitly point to (the pong benchmark) is very synthetic and says fairly little about real-life use.

Not ever.<p>Second, if we had not been fighting -- and holding to only WebM for HTML5 video until last year -- while our competition was shipping H.264 for HTML video, you might be able to say that we didn&#x27;t fight. If we had not tried to make s/w VP8 perform on lower-end mobile phones ahead of others including Google, you might make that charge.<p>But we did those things and failed. We learned from those negative results. What have you done? What have you learned? Where is your skin in the game?<p>Third, MPEG LA has not thrown us a bone. Cisco != MPEG LA. Taking H.264 to zero price is a net public good and a prerequisite for getting RF licensing of part or all of H.264 for all desktop systems (since rents there, as opposed to on mobile devices, are running low).<p>When we do that in the next year (or sooner) based on taking the price to zero, and gain free as in speech licensing, will you thank us? Not likely.<p>Fourth, MPEG LA was not terrified of HTML5 standardizing on a truly RF codec, because HTML5 was never going to do any such thing. Now you&#x27;re just confabulating. Again, read<p><a href=""http://brendaneich.com/2012/03/video-mobile-and-the-open-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brendaneich.com/2012/03/video-mobile-and-the-open-web...</a><p>and wake up and smell last year&#x27;s coffee.<p>As for &quot;they got you cheap&quot;, if I were about money, I would have gone to Google ages ago. If Mozilla were about money we would have sold out in any number of ways.<p>This is not about money, it is about interoperation and zero-price ceiling for H.264 now, and RF licensing for desktop next -- and after that, better codecs that are defensibly unencumbered and/or downloadable in JS and WebGL2 or better (probably both).<p>None of this is easy to pull off. Rejecting interoperation is a sure way to die fast for no good end. Shouting about betrayal on HN is cheap and easy by comparison. Try doing something productive for a change.<p>/be",1383188214

The NSA does not keep everything it collects, but it keeps a lot.</i><p>There&#x27;s a problem with this.  The Post goes into a good amount of detail regarding <i>how</i> the NSA/GCHQ is collecting, but leaves nothing but speculation as to <i>who</i> they&#x27;re targeting or <i>why</i>.  It even goes so far as to suggest that NSA/GCHQ is targeting millions upon millions of ordinary citizens without giving evidence to back up that assertion.  I would argue that these media outlets are doing us a disservice by not providing this information.  All they&#x27;re doing is generating hype and fear.  I&#x27;m scrolling through the comments here and seeing calls for the imprisonment (or worse) of Obama administration officials and NSA personnel based not on solid evidence that the public at large is being spied upon, but based on our fear that the public is being spied upon.  Some hypothetical headlines as an analogy:<p>A: &quot;SWAT team guns down local residents&quot;<p>B: &quot;SWAT team guns down unarmed retirement home residents&quot;<p>C: &quot;SWAT team guns down pair of local gunmen; ends killing spree&quot;<p>Headline A is vague and misleading.  If that was the entirety of the information put out, the public would be outraged.  If the actual story was closer to headline B, they&#x27;d be rightfully outraged, and all trust in the police force would be rightfully gone.  The outrage wouldn&#x27;t be justified if the actual story was closer to headline C.  With regards to today&#x27;s story, I don&#x27;t want see something like &quot;NSA spies on Google traffic&quot; - there&#x27;s not enough context.  I want to see evidence showing who they&#x27;re targeting and why.  If it turns out that they&#x27;re spying on US Congressmen, major business executives or just ordinary Americans with the intent to blackmail/bribe/manipulate/etc. - that&#x27;s the reason to call for these people to stand trial.  If it turns out that they&#x27;re spying on the unencrypted internet traffic of valid intelligence targets like foreign government officials/foreign spies/terrorists/etc., what has the public gained by telling us all how they&#x27;re doing it?<p>The media needs to show us that there&#x27;s a good reason to be afraid/outraged of a vast, covert Orwellian apparatus, then show us how to protect ourselves against it.  Show us that the NSA is determined to undermine the public good for its own benefit.  Unless there is no vast, hidden Orwellian state.  Every Snowden document that gets released without showing evidence that the NSA is pursuing anyone besides those it has been tasked to pursue leads me to believe more and more that there is no such evidence, and the media is riding high on all of this fear and outrage to gather advertising dollars.",1383187070

In my whole experience as a full stack developer, after having tried various technologies and languages and frameworks - including ones built with PHP, Ruby, Scala, Javascript and Golang, I can this say with full confidence and can afford to put my name and credibility to stake - Nothing is going to replace Ruby on rails anytime soon.<p>I wish something would, but nothing at the moment, is even close to the scale at which rails gets things done.  I truly mean it. And something built out of Javascript replacing a Ruby-based full-bleed framework? I think you must be fucking kidding me. What the author describes is a very specific use-case and maybe, just maybe Meteor JS <i>might</i> replace a portion of that use case. In fact, if I were to do something like what the author suggests, I would still choose rails and Knockout JS (or Angular JS if you know it better).<p>Do you know how long it takes to build a Facebook <i>backend</i> clone in rails? Maybe a day? And the frontend (all the Ajaxy stuff) should probably add a week or two (worse-case scenario). That&#x27;s just it. That&#x27;s the power of rails.<p>If you were to build the backend in Javascript without the power that Rails provides I&#x27;m sure you will need more than just a day, let alone a week.<p>The point is, nothing is close to what rails is right now. I badly wanted something to replace rails for my work, but I haven&#x27;t found a single solution that fits my needs. I&#x27;ve tried everything - Play, Sails, Revel, Gorilla, etc etc. But nothing there is that can replace rails. And all the frameworks that claim to be more like Rails, they&#x27;re simply not true. Have you tried using play (Scala) and PostgreSQL together? The experience is nothing like Rails.<p>I can make a clone of any complex app out there in the web in a matter of minutes/hours. That&#x27;s the power that rails gives me and no other framework/combination can&#x27;t.<p>I understand that Rails is slow. But this is not the right way to critique it - Claiming something is going to replace it when it actually isn&#x27;t true.<p>We develop all our v0.1s in Rails in house and port them to Go (<i>only</i> if necessary and if the project owner is particular about it.) and that seems to work well for us.",1383186279

With the right kind of well directed projects the tables can, and will, be turned.<p>Imagine, for example, a web that was designed to prevent evesdropping and designed to ensure maximum longevity of content (through duplication). Something closer to bittorrent than today&#x27;s web. It would be technologically challenging, but doable. Then imagine what happens if the equivalent of the worldwide workforce developing, say, linux was dedicated to developing tools to decentralize the network.<p>Over the next few decades the cost of wireless APs will become trivial even as their capabilities increase vastly.

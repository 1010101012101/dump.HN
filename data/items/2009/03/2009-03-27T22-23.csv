535828,comment,535749,535813,0,0,randomwalker,,,"This is true. I crawled the twitter graph back in Dec 07 as part of my research on social networks (which is coincidentally on HN currently), and I was shocked by how few users they had (at least in the giant connected component, which is really all that counts.) The numbers that were being thrown around by Arrington and co. were <i>ten times</i> greater.<p>Twitter has indeed received an amazingly positive coverage, if not for which it would have taken them far longer to get to their current user count (and who knows if they would have had enough cash in the bank in that case?)",1238194374
535827,comment,534959,535167,0,0,bokonist,,,"Both good points.  Determining whether the U.S. or China has more economic freedom is difficult, because their ways of restricting freedom are so different.<p><i>discourse means that sound discussion of economic policy at a deep and detailed level can't happen.</i><p>It definitely happens among the elites, I once attended a workshop in Guangzhou about problems in urban planning.  You can criticize the government's actions, you just cannot question its legitimacy.  But even then you probably won't be jailed.  Being an open supporter of democracy in China is like being an open racist in the U.S.  You probably won't get jailed, but you will find your career not going so well.  It is true you see far less policy debate in the popular press, but personally I'd have to be convinced that there is any link between the amount of popular debate over a certain issue and the quality of the eventual solution.<p>Lack of transparency is always definitely an economic hindrance, no question there.  It's a bad problem both in China and the U.S..",1238194206

You really need someone you trust to evaluate the candidates.  Find successful entrepreneurs in your area and have their VP of sales help.  Exercise your network.  Enlist your SO, neighbors.  VC's might help.  I'm not kidding.  An ad on Craigslist will probably attract some slick scum.<p>More advice from the salesman.  Hire a salesman driving a Mercedes.  The payments will keep him motivated.  I once hired a salesman driving a beater and got performance commensurate with his car.<p>We are supposed to be gender neutral in this world, but I think that women beat us males in people skills, and sales is very much people skills. If nothing else, run your candidate by a sharp woman.<p>EDIT:  When I wrote this I was thinking of direct sales, which is hugely expensive.  I strongly recommend against it.  Been there. Done that.  I found telemarketing with skilled salespeople to be much more cost effective.  And I really mean skilled, well trained, and well paid.  Serve yourself is the most cost effective of all.<p>Disclaimer:  I have run sales, but I dont pretend that I was any good at it.",1238192595

Most clients of most translators can only check the accuracy of one of the translator's languages, which allows for a good bit of bluffing.

It was two young guys (mid-20s) talking about search engines, both obviously comfortable with business concepts, one with a decent technical understanding and the other not so much.  I gathered that they lived in the neighborhood, and I knew they needed to be extremely well-off to do so, so I was naturally curious about what kind of people make so much money so fast in technology.  Were they, I wondered, extremely bright?<p>I figured out quickly that the technical guy was pretty bright, but I never got a hand on the other guy.  He exhibited behaviors that I associate with idiocy or flat-out frat boy douchebaggery:  making things up, pretending to understand things he didn't, ridiculing ideas that he didn't even pretend to understand (I'm not making that up), bragging about himself, continuing stories after his listener had pointed out that their premise was factually untrue, and so on.  Yet occasionally he said something that made me think no, a stupid person could never have said that.  Plus the technical guy, who apparently knew him well, was taking all of this douchebaggery in stride and was talking to him as if he were an intellectual equal, not holding back or simplifying at all.  The technical guy had apparently known this guy long enough to realize that he was much smarter than he seemed.<p>Even the fact that the technical guy consistently, quietly corrected the other guy's facts -- and then sat patiently while the guy finished his story despite the fact that the correction removed both the point and the credibility of the story -- seemed to indicate that they had a considerable level of mutual comfort and respect.  I mean, if the guy had really been a complete idiot, the technical guy would not have bothered correcting him so often.  Not to mention that an arrogant idiot would not have been so tolerant of correction as this guy was.<p>Anyway, that whole story was just to illustrate that there is a huge cultural gap between technical people and nontechnical people.  The way that guy acted, I would not have trusted him to feed my goldfish.  Apparently, though, he was a bright guy who had learned a different set of social mores.",1238191298

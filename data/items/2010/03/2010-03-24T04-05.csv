You need a few to know that it's consistent, but at least 200 runs to be statistically sound, and you're not gonna get exactly 40x on each of those runs.  Sometimes it will be 40x, sometimes 35x, sometimes 1.5x.<p>What the article doesn't mention is, was that the highest measured performance increment, or was it the mean or median or most common?  Also, what was the margin of error in that reading?",1269406424

1214993,comment,1214870,1214982,0,0,crux,,,"I can tell you why I like it. There's an app that's been repped for here called Scrivener, and like Scrivener (it predates Scr., actually), Ulysses is an application that is supposed to make writing large amounts of text more sane than standard word processors. It essentially combines elements of outliners and information managers with a composition interface.<p>In general the UI for Ulysses is <i>very</i> thoroughly thought out, and somewhat idiosyncratic for that fact. Many people find it lacking or uncomfortable in one way or another, but I can tell you that every element of the UI has been considered and applied to fulfill the designers' very specific goal.<p>One of those UI values is that it's very semantically correct. There's no formatting at all, except auto-formatting that you define yourself, which will recognize plaintext tags. The way this shakes out is that I will write a sentence like this: The &&quick&& brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.<p>And then define a tag called 'emphasis', which is formed by a '&&' wrap, and displays itself in a certain way depending on whether it's being viewed in a window, fullscreen, printed, et cetera.<p>If you are a fan of working in plaintext and you are interested in more structured ways to write long-form text, I think it's a great program.<p>EDIT: changed example markup to something more exotic for HN's own parser",1269406097

It's hard to read what's going on very easily.<p>2) They released 0.9.5 which produced crashes in ruby (!) and this bit us hard. This is really a bit of a ding on how gems are packaged and distributed. We tried to package is as an RPM (Amahi is Fedora-based) and it was harder than other (bigger) gems due to some things we could not figure out quick enough. I really like it, however, the community did not really help much in getting to the bottom of this, probably because it's still a bit small, I guess. No question that it will grow. :)<p>3) (ok more than a couple, though this one may not be a Sinatra issue). We rely on periodic http calls to get our installer progress shown on the browser (via jQuery). Some times one http call breaks (to localhost no network involved!) and we have not been able to figure out why. We believe we have mostly eliminated jQuery, leaving Sinatra as the main suspect. Maybe we have another bug in there we're hitting? It's not too repeatable, sadly.<p>Congrats on the 1.0 release!!",1269405585

I and my (now) wife graduated from a reasonably well known college of engineering as classmates. I had decent marks so I got a job during campus placement. It was a good pay for a fresh grad from industry wide perspective. My wife didn't have the greatest scores (but the scores weren't too bad either). She didn't get a job for ~8 months. After that she did get a job in a tiny company (~5-10 people) that took her in as a trainee for zero pay. 3-4 months after working there, she could use that experience to get a job that paid her about USD 60 (INR 3000) per month, which is quite low (I pay my cook that much now a days for an hours work, this was about 10 years ago). And then over time she worked in different companies and is now has a good job with in a well know cellphone provided. As for me, I comfortably worked for about 8 years in different companies, following which I dabbled in a startup with an ex-colleague and now taking a breaking to work on a few hobby projects.<p>The point being, that in India, getting good scores required to having a comfortable life. There may be exceptions, but if you don't get a good score you will pretty much be struggling for the first few years irrespective of how good you are.",1269405546

The investment laws are not about stopping it, they are about giving Goldman Sachs a percentage of every fraud.

The destruction is generally so complete that a dark age follows.  Forget taxpayers holding the bag, you need archeologists to figure out what happened from the bits of that society that would not burn.<p>Conversely, the Western Enlightenment showed that you can get growth and prosperity undreamed by the kings of old even in the face of pervasive investment fraud.  What counts is a culture of liberty, optimism, and a commitment to basic policing.

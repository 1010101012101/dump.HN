Instead, one might define a type, `type Adder Interface{Add(Adder)Adder}`, and then a function to add anything you want is fairly trivial, `func Sum(a ...Adder) Adder`, put anything you want in it, then assert the type of what comes out.<p>When it comes to iteration, there is the generator pattern, in which a channel is returned, and then the thread &#x27;drinks&#x27; the channel until it is dry, for example `func (m myType) Walk() chan->myType` can be iterated over via `range v := mt.Walk(){ [...] }`. Non-channel based patterns also exist, tokenisers usually have a Next() which can be used to step into the next token, etc.<p>The Nil pointer is not unsafe as far as I know, from the FAQ: <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/faq#no_pointer_arithmetic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/faq#no_pointer_arithmetic</a><p>The writer seems to believe that functions on nil pointers crash the program, this is not the case.

7962404,comment,7960762,7962255,1,0,thegeomaster,,,"The lambda approach is slower because a function call always has some overhead. In lower-level C-like languages the overhead is usually lighter than in interpreted languages such as Python. In this case, reduce will have to call the lambda everytime, which is a few more instructions for the processor and some checking by the interpreter. Then the lambda will compute the sum, and then return to the caller. It&#x27;s not a lot of time, but it&#x27;s certainly faster than knowing what you need to do at the call site.<p>As srean pointed out, however, it&#x27;s not all black and white like I described. He raises some good points like what the Python interpreter does when it needs to look up the type of the variable, etc etc.<p>I come across those kinds of &quot;it&#x27;s obvious&quot; things all the time, too, especially in the world of more functional and powerful languages. When people write Ruby or Lisp (I&#x27;m learning them ATM) some solutions are simply obvious to them, when I would&#x27;ve done the complete opposite. I got used to this and simply accepted that these will become obvious to me one day, when I grok the concepts. And when I really don&#x27;t understand something that is &quot;obvious&quot;, I ask, and people are very happy to explain it to me. I&#x27;ve never once encountered a condescending reaction. So no need to get upset because of it. We&#x27;re all used to doing different things and different things are obvious to us. Doesn&#x27;t mean that anyone is arrogant or something, it&#x27;s simply that people usually look at the world through their own eyes :)",1404075922

Being healthy isn&#x27;t a guarantee that something bad won&#x27;t happen to you.<p>Sick days are also designed to protect employees who are <i>not</i> sick by keeping sick people out of the office where they could infect others. To make this effective, the company needs to provide enough sick days to cover the illness of an average person, not just the healthiest person. So you&#x27;re actually benefiting from other employees having more sick days than you yourself could use. (There also needs to be a corporate culture where people are not discouraged from using sick days because there&#x27;s &quot;too much work to do&quot;.)",1404075770

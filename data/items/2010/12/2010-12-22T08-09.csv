C# was originally a Java clone, but the designers liberally borrowed from everywhere, worrying about actual use cases and not purity of any sort.

I especially like this one for getting a general overview of a variety of coding related categories and practices.  Being self-taught, it's been been an invaluable source for broadening my basic understanding of the field.  The guys that run the podcast definitely strike me as being more involved in the corporate space, but the topics are relevant to just about every topic in software construction, from episodes on embedded real-time systems, an interview on the internals of the gcc compiler, clojure, and tons of others.<p>I listen to This American Life frequently.  The stories are always fascinating and well-produced.<p>Stuff You Should Know has always been one of my favorites.  It's like spastically browsing the internet in audio form.  You learn all kinds of super-interesting things, but never really learn much about any one subject.  I'd suggest this for long car-trips when you're not trying to accomplish anything, heh.  Love it, though.<p>howstuffworks.com has a lot of interesting ones outside of Stuff You Should Know, but I'd hit that one first.<p>those are my favorites, off the top of my head<p>History of Rome,

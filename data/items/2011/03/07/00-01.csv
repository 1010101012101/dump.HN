2295544,comment,2294783,2294908,0,0,shawnee_,,,"<i>There are so many sites and nothing centralized has really taken off. Even when you boil it down to one city.</i><p>Wrong.   There IS something centralized:  it's called the Multiple Listing Service, and ONLY Brokers and Realtors have ""access"" to it.   They are salespeople, and salespeople compete only with each other.  That 6 percent commission is the unwavering aspect of their model -- they built it to ensure that it always gets dropped into their shark tank.  Consumers do not benefit from this system, ever, and every single entity in the real estate industry wants to keep it that way.<p><i>Even the fact that brokers exist is a sign of market inefficiency. Why do I need an intermediary to find an apartment?</i><p>You don't.  However, brokers are not the intermediaries; they are at the top of the pyramid scheme.  After studying this industry from every possible angle, my conclusion is that purveyors of the current system are rotten to the core.  Their lobbying group (the National Association of Realtors:  <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=s</a>) is about as rotten as a swimming pool of maggot-covered dead skunks that's been sitting in the sun for a week.<p>The pecking order is as such:<p><pre><code>  Broker Realtors + Mortgage Brokers  \n  Agent Realtors  + Mortgage Loan Agents (Bankers)\n  Leasing Agents (Realtors)\n  Property Management Companies AKA ""Landlords""\n   </code></pre>\nAnd all of them, working together, have only one incentive, and that is insanely high rents (yes, <i>rents</i>).  As long as rents are high, the rest of their system is safe, and home ownership remains an unattainable pipe dream for most people.  Which it really is, unless you're one of them.  Realtors with their glossy booklets and shiny websites sell the <i>illusion</i> of ownership, and it works!  Poof, and all of a sudden, it becomes so ""necessary"" to have a Realtor to help people navigate the scary world of shopping for a home.  (See also:  the housing boom of 2006.)<p>Build an excel spreadsheet that shows how much interest vs principle people pay on a typical 30-year loan over time.  Now figure out how long it'll take to pay off the commission that your Realtor earns for his 2.5 hours of ""work"" on your behalf.  Oh, and don't forget to include every penny of your life savings you've already forked over as the ""down payment.""  (Down payments don't go toward equity, they go to pay the salespeople!)  Pity the people who have been hoodwinked into thinking that their house payments are actually going to equity, that that 30-year mortgage means that they're going to own their house some day.  The banks are too smart to let people do that, that's why they invented refinancing!<p>As long as the greatest portion of income people earn goes to rent, neither savings nor long-term equity can be obtained.  As long as people are unable to build equity, they are trapped in a system that essentially forces them into paying whatever rents are demanded of them.   Most people who live in Silicon Valley know this:  1K for a 0 bedroom apartment?  Really?<p>The solution for consumers is NOT going to come by making it easier for Brokers and Landlords / Agents to hook up and control prices, that's for sure.  This is a recipe for disaster on a grand scale.",1299459244

But what I have found personally is that a) I didn't learn how to live until I spent a lot of time at death's door and b) most people who speak with me are invigorated by exposure to ..whatever I got out of that experience.  They get to get some perspective on their own lives and problems and sometimes decided that the concerns they are obsessing over are just stupid and not that important.  I have terrible financial problems, which are a real issue.  I would likely have them had I pursued conventional treatments as well only I wouldn't be getting well.  But my creditors aren't going to come cut out my lungs or the lungs of my 23 year old son (who has the same diagnosis I have), which is basically what I would be facing otherwise (lung transplants are really common with my condition).  So I just can't find it in me to be as upset about my financial situation as other people sometimes seem to think I should be.<p>Technology went a long way towards saving my life, both literally and figuratively. It gave me a social life when I as unable to leave my house.  It gave me access to research when I was too sick to go to a library.  It gave me a means to occupy my time when having nothing to do but go crazy from constant unrelieved pain was a fate worse than death.<p>I don't really see the issue with the post on Reddit.  I would agree with you if someone posted here that they have a new startup idea and plan to make a site specifically to have exactly this kind of post as its sole purpose.  I thought the community was very supportive and kind and humane in its treatment of the situation, suprisingly so given how much trash gets talked about Reddit on HN.<p>But then I am some feverish twit just hanging out here tonight because I can't sleep and can't focus to do anything more than shoot the breeze with strangers...etc...what the hell do I know?<p>Edit:  And it's really not intended as argument. It's intended as conversation.

It's so far from reality that I feel compelled to ask if you've actually read them.<p>I have read them.<p>I think that even the byte examples you linked are better than 99% of the articles that appear even on HN and certainly what passes for tech journalism.  They don't stir the heart but they are informative and concise - reading them even now doesn't feel like I've wasted my time.  I disagree about the lasting value - they are concise and provide a very quick way to get an understanding of what was going on in the industry at the time.  Mocking them for using terminology which now seems dated is out of place.<p>There simply isn't a place now where I can even pay to get this kind of concise but technical view of what's going on.<p>The LWN stuff is narrow and much less concise, and although the blogs you mention do have very good stuff, they are also narrow and also have some intensely time wasting hobby horses.<p><i>BUT</i><p>I will concede: most of the individual pieces you list in your penultimate paragraph are indeed excellent. Even though  even some of them are surrounded by time wasting random personal fluff, and a couple of them take 10 paragraphs to beautifully make a single emotive point.  Which frankly, I can do without most of the time.<p>It's quite possible that there wasn't even one article per issue on average that compares favorably to the very best blog pieces.<p>But none of that changes the fact that there is no source for this kind of concise and consistent material anymore.<p>I want a magazine (electronic is fine) that gives good <i>technical</i> coverage of the industry with concise articles that don't waste my time, where every piece is of reasonable quality and some special pieces are really great.  Monthly would be fine.<p>What I have is tens of sites that give narrow coverage, and are mostly full of dross.  In order to find the good material (none of which is the concise cross-industry coverage mind you), I have to visit all of them every day and sift through hundreds of pieces of rubbish looking for the odd gem. Oh - and guess what?  I have to read a lot more rubbish to even know whether it was good or not.<p>As I said originally, the web has brought us stuff we didn't have before - volume, and I'll concede some higher quality stuff than we ever had before.<p>But we've also obviously lost something.

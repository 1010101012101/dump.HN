We had some xml processing tasks that almost never used much memory but every now and then would need tons. It was one part I couldn't thin-provision.<p>Am I right in interpreting this as shipping the JVM work off to a dedicated appliance-like server? Does that mean the memory profile on the appliance is the one that can be thin-provisioned?<p>Heap size tuning is one of those things that made me hate the JVM.",1293972543

2059948,comment,2059599,2059599,0,0,eitally,,,"I take some umbrage at the ubiquitous slighting of PowerPoint, et al.  The vast majority of ""business"" presentations are for an internal audience that is already partially pre-briefed and the presenter just uses the slides to jog his or her own memory of the important points to review in the meeting.  It's essentially pre-written agenda+minutes, and it doesn't have to be anything more.<p>This is easily contrasted to the kinds of professional presenters you see at TED, or someone like Steve Jobs, but those are public presentations of novel content.  Not at all the same, and it's not fair to directly compare the work these folks do to prepare and rehearse their presentations to what 9-to-5ers do.  Nearly zero internal business presentations need to be so polished, either in formatting or delivery.",1293971807

The old 'password approach' is no longer such a feasible option.<p>But my question is: Do you feel that there is a need for multiple sign on solutions per user? If i have the option of signing in with Facebook and Twitter should the Twitter sign in automagically find my Facebook-created user and link those two up as well? 
I'm just wondering as it's something i have been annoyed at for a while.<p>Or is it fine that multiple signup methods will also create multiple users? 
The data returned from all these sites should have some sort of common data it should be able to find the others users by?

That's just a maintenance hassle. A username is not a secret - that's what the password is for. The random password isn't so great, either, because it pretty much forces you to write it down and then it just becomes a (poor) version of the SSL certificate. It should instead be a strong password that you can actually remember.",1293970504

You track something like ""work on this idea/project 30min everyday"", and multiple times you'll try to do it quickly to 'get rid of the task' as quickly as possible.<p>As you'll notice multiple times though, once you get started, you'll feel like going way past the 30min mark. Also, not having the 'responsibility' of working more than 30min will usually make the rest of the time working feel like less of a grind and more pleasurable.",1293970311

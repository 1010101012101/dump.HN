People following everyone who follows them (Out of etiquette?), but then using a twitter client that allows them to ignore all the tweets from them??? It makes no sense!!! Waste of bandwidth, resources etc.<p>IMHO Twitter should have a limit on the number of people you can follow. Maybe 50 max. I don't see how you can follow more than that and it be useful. Past that you may as well just check the public updates or do searches for specific things surely. That would be just slightly more efficient than everyone following thousands, then filtering in their twitter client, which seems to be what happens atm.<p></twrant>",1242221880

606847,comment,606363,606363,0,0,FraaJad,,,"Juno looks to be simple and the developer has chosen a good set of libraries to build it on. It is a demonstration of the inherent simplicity in using well written, WSGI aware python libraries.<p>IMO, web.py qualifies to be called ""really lightweight""<p>take for instance the hello world code:<p><pre><code>    import web

    urls = (
        '/(.*)', 'hello'
    )
    
    app = web.application(urls, globals())

    class hello:

            if not name: 
                name = 'world'
            return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'
 
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        app.run()

</code></pre>
This has two advantages over the Juno code..<p>1. more `REST`y (GET/POST)<p>2. `app` object is a wsgi callable..<p>More importantly, web.py does not need have any external library dependencies unless you choose to use mysql/postgresql when you have to install the db interface libraries. I had problem running the hello world Juno code because I did not have pysqlite2 installed.. huh? why do I need pysqlite2 to return a string?<p>While some may object saying that web.py has a case of NIH, the code of web.py itself does not reflect any such attitude. The whole library is just a directory of aptly named modules. You can plop it anywhere in the python path and start coding ..",1242221550

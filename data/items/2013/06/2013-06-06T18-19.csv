All the manual labor you had to do, keeping track of memory layouts and registers and stack frames, was handled automatically for you.  Yet the result is not that programming became easier - it's that programs became more complex.  A journeyman programmer today can write Tetris in a few hours, while it took how many months for the original?  But modern games are things like Starcraft 2 and Halo, not Tetris and Space Invaders.<p>Same with databases.  It used to be that you had to think in terms of bytes in sectors on a disk.  Now we have filesystems and databases and query languages to abstract that all away from us.  But that doesn't mean programming the systems becomes easier, it means that the volume and variety of data stored increases.<p>It used to be that domains like speech recognition, natural language processing, text mining, computer vision, OCR, etc. were completely off-limits for computational approaches.  Now we have standard libraries for them, and standardized tools for generating those standard libraries.  But that just means the tools get applied to progressively more problems, not that solving those problems becomes easier.<p>I think this is what Marc Andreesen meant when he said that ""Software is eating the world"".  There will eventually come a time when no more software engineers will be needed, when they have automated themselves out of a job.  But that time will come when <i>everything</i> we do is computerized, when every aspect of modern life is ruled by algorithms and data.  Until then, advances in technology just mean computation can be applied to more and more problem domains.",1370544405

It's a matter of reading provisions of the Constitution in historical context, not interpreting every provision in the broadest possible way in which it could be interpreted, and handling tensions between Constitutional provisions through balancing instead of just picking our favorite provision and giving it maximal effect.<p>1) Free speech zones: At the time of the founding, state police power was considered nearly unlimited, and the First Amendment didn't apply to the states at all. So how do you reconcile the state's police power with the right of people to peacefully assemble? The answer does not have to be ""you have to read the right to assemble in the broadest way possible to the exclusion of any legitimate state interest in policing."" That's one mode of interpretation, but that's not the only justifiable one.<p>2) The Adam Walsh Act. Not an ex post facto law because it doesn't directly change the criminal status of any person, but rather directs, optionally, states to conform their registration laws to certain standards. Many states do not have ex post facto clauses in their state Constitutions. See: <a href=""http://congress-courts-legislation.blogspot.com/2011/01/state-ex-post-facto-clauses-and-adam.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://congress-courts-legislation.blogspot.com/2011/01/stat...</a>.<p>3) Iraq War: The Constitution does not say that Congress must declare war before any hostilities are initiated. It just says that ""The Congress shall have Power... To declare War..."" Absent much guidance as to what this provision means, we can look to historical practice. And almost immediately we see that no formal declaration of war (whatever that is--the Constitution never uses the term) was considered necessary when presidents of the founding fathers' generation engaged in hostilities with Tripoli and Algiers, within just a few decades of the founding.<p>This is not to try and convince you of these points.

By ""children's songs"" I don't mean songs adults sing for children, but rather the songs children sing among themselves. There are many variations of these songs, and it would be interesting to see how they vary regionally.<p>For instance, when I was a kid, we had:<p><pre><code>   He's Popeye the sailor man
   He lives in a garbage can
   *He eats all the worms
   *And spits out the germs
   He's Popeye the sailor man
</code></pre>
There are many variants of the lines I've marked with asterisks:<p><pre><code>   He pees like a fountain
   And poops out a mountain

   They turned on the gas
   And it burned off my ass

   He catches all the lizards
   and eats all their gizzards

   He sleeps with his granny
   And tickles her fanny

   He likes to go swimmin'
   With bare naked women
</code></pre>
Same goes for other children's songs. There's the ""Joy to the world/the school burned down"" song, for instance. In ours, the principle ended up hanging from the flag pole by his dick. In others he's hanged by his neck. Ours didn't mention the janitor, but some others have him shot in the head.<p>There are also variants in things like ""eeny meeny miny moe"". Every parent in my neighborhood taught the next part as ""catch a tiger by the toe"", but every kid said (when out of earshot of adults) ""catch a nigger by the toe"". Where did that come from? I can't recall any adults using that word in my California suburban neighborhood and have no idea where we kids got that for eeny meeny miny moe. I suspect we got it by whatever mysterious mechanism we got our versions of songs.<p>(Speaking of eeny meeny miny moe, I'm guessing that I'm not the only one here who figured out ahead of time the rudiments of modular arithmetic, and used that to my advantage whenever I saw that an eeny meeny miny moe was going to take place...anyone else want to admit to massively cheating at eeny meeny miny moe?)<p>Another thing about children's songs.

quite significant (we need to get our economy going, and wasting money hurts).  Second, big gumment is a real threat to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" and nearly
everything we want.<p>But you want to emphasize ""effective"" gumment.  Okay.
So did I:  I said that we should get the NSA being
""safe and effective"" for our country.  ""Safe"" mostly
means that the NSA doesn't trash our Constitution and
ruin the US, and ""effective"" means what you want, catch
the bad guys.<p>Now we come to the hard part:  Catching the bad guys.
In the case of Boston, as I pointed out, Russia told
us.  Russia was correct.  So, really, it's getting
clear:  The NSA's ideas of all that 'big data' 
is not very effective.  I know; I know; some of the
Senators will say that in the secret hearings the
NSA, FBI, DHS, CIA, etc. guys explain all the bad
guys they stopped, bad guys that never made the
news.  Given Boston, I don't believe it!  What I
believe is that they go after some guy in the second
grade in the lunch room who takes the bread from
his sandwich, cuts it out to like like a gun,
shows it around his lunch table, and the big 
gumment guys shut down the school.  Or they go
after Aaron Swartz.  They are just not competent.
So, they are not effective.<p>""Big"" is always a threat:  Ike warned about the
military-industrial complex, and the bigness is
much of the positive feedback loop that has it
grow.<p>Sure, we'd both like more competence.  Remember
9/11?  Or, remember one of the core reasons?  Right:
Some semi-, pseudo-, quasi-bright guy had one of
his better ideas:  If a terrorist tries to take
over an airplane in mid-flight, then don't resist and,
instead, let him have it.  Presto:  Open, engraved
invitation to 9/11.  Bet you can't do that now.
Even if managed to get on an airplane with 
various weapons, bet couldn't take over the
plane and fly it into a big building.  So,
need the TSA, DHS, and NSA for that?  Nope:
Just change the silly rule that says give
an airplane to any terrorist who asks.<p>Competence is more difficult.  I'm all
for more in competence.  But big and
competent don't go well together.<p>Look, it's not worth trashing our Constitution,
setting up an organization that could take
us to Hitler, and wasting the big bucks 
to set up an NSA that could
catch another Boston bomber, even if such
an organization could catch another bomber,
which likely they can't.  Heck, again, the
Russians told us about those two 
loser, wacko nutjobs, which is much better
info than we could have hoped for from
the NSA, and still we did nothing.<p>Big gumment in England?  Go after a guy
because of something about pictures of
nude children on his computer that turned
out to be his grandchildren playing with
water in the yard.<p>Big gumment in the US?  Have some Department
of Natural Resources (DNR) go after a couple
with several cats, several dogs, and
a five year old deer they had raised from
a fawn whose mother had just been killed
in an auto accident, really, a minute
or so before the fawn was born.  So the
DNR has in their imagination that 
deer, with their hoofs, can hurt people.
Of course, in this case, the deer has been
just fine, in the house, with several dogs
and cats, for five years, not even hurting
the furniture.  Big gumment.<p>And we have the Aaron Swartz case, gumment
going wacko over some PDF files readily available to everyone
at MIT for free and in paper form
in nearly every research library in the world
for the cost of photocopying.  Big gumment.<p>We saw in the IRS case big gumment 
abusing its powers.  Well, the NSA data would
be an engraved invitation to more
such abuses -- shakedowns, blackmail,
payoffs, kickbacks, etc.<p>In reality, the more effective gumment you
want will have to be smaller gumment.<p>There's a recent example with the F-35.  Supposedly
part of the problem with that program is that
someone wants to change the specifications
on some screw, so they have a meeting all day
with everyone affected, 600 people, that is
a representative from each of all the possibly affected
subcontractors or some such.  The solution?
The Lockheed Skunk Works deliberately kept
small enough to keep up communications and
keep down the huge meetings.<p>For the NSA phone data, that sounds like the
old project Total Information Awareness or
some such.  There has been a little company
on a few floors of a not very attractive
office building on the space of a shopping
mall in a suburb of Boston.  Once I went
for an interview.  I used to do 'artificial
intelligence', i.e., 'expert systems', and
they were big on that, likely from what
some people at DARPA are still dreaming
about.  So, they wanted to get data on
phone calls, maybe e-mail messages,
postcards, whatever, with data on
from, to, and date, and then build a
big directed graph with an arc for
each communication and a node for
each person sending or receiving.
Then they wanted to do some analysis
of the graph, look for 'cliques' or
some such.  While they explained, I tried
to stay awake, but being really interested
was asking too much.  BS.  Total BS.
But it looks like the graph people
have taken over the NSA.  All the
brighter people in Russia are likely
doing a ROFL.  I'm not laughing:
It's expensive, dumb, and dangerous.

He's a CTO caliber amazing architect and I consider him a partner in the project.<p>The current codebase is the 3rd-ish iteration on the same theme.  The first and second iterations were built primarily by me, so I had a pretty good sense of how I wanted everything built for the future (incidentally, my ""pretty good sense"" was totally garbage, and if i started over again, it'd be totally different... again...)<p>Even the early versions of the current iteration were largely a collaborative code effort between me and Henrique, either hitting milestones by ""divide and conquer"" or by pair programming.<p>As the product began maturing, I have been slowly shifting away from code to marketing and CEO/CMO-y stuff.  Basically, I am not good at being a heavily involved CTO and marketing.  My perspective here is that development <i>CAN</i> be outsourced, though it may not be easy, but good marketing and bizdev can <i>NOT</i>.

I'm also below the threshold where reporting companies really want to cut me breaks, so I'll have to wait a little further before that.<p>The ""cost of reports"" component scales linearly, but I expect the fixed costs to be pretty static for very large ranges of total users/applications.

And then when someone in that company reports (to media) that bunch of people are breaking the law, they become a criminal and, as Feinstein said: ""need to be persecuted"". How can you believe, in your sound mind, that there will be ANY freedom left in this country within next 5-7 years?? HOW??<p>Guess what Feinstein?

Typically, what we called * designers* were technical people who were very good at working with fancy 3D parametric, version controlled CAD systems. They could come up with mechanical designs and drawings at a rapid pace and good results. They rarely had engineering degrees and leaned a bit on the technical knowledge of the engineers when they needed to.<p>But we had one guy who refused to learn the new systems and instead insisted on using old, some might say <i>obsolete</i>) 2D CAD that he was familiar with. He happend to have an engineering degree, but most wouldn't guess because 9 out of 10 people picked him out as a dead ringer for Charlie Manson. He was loud, sometimes dirty, dressed more like a biker than an engineer, and he was rude and stubborn. I liked the guy. I really did. But I think I held a rare view, as most people found him offensive and crude. Some refused to work with him. ""I'm not changing that"" was almost a calling card of his.<p>Yet in spite of all of that, he designed a frighteningly high percentage of the space hardware that actually flew. His time was in demand and he produced easily as much as the designers with more modern tools. I never counted, but I'd bet he produced more than they did. And it was good because he was brilliantly skilled at the <i>real</i> task at hand.<p>So in the end, the technology did not matter - the man did.<p>I don't bring that up to argue- just think there's something worth thinking about.",1370542033

Besides from some creative leaps, a lot of this has to do with logic: knowing what works where and when.<p>I'm working on an idea tied to literate programming where someone can tell a story of what they want a program to do, put it in a wiki, and then programmers can edit the wiki to add in the actual software to make the program work. How hard would it be to use NLP parsing, feed it into something using the priciples from BDD, take something that turns that into UML the run it through a code generator and you have an MVP. Software engineers may then end up like manufacturing engineers in that their job is to tweak and fine tune the output. But even then that part of the job may fall to ML which recognizes similar patterns between software implementation and optimum utilization (there are only so many ways to write a user login page on a web app for example)<p>I think <i>thinking</i> will never become mass-produced, but Mass-producing turning thoughts into software may happen within my lifetime.<p>Edit: missed out the main point from my last sentence.",1370541660

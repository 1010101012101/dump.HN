""Edward Wheeler"" = ""Edward Wheeler"") then you'd be totally right about nothing being revolutionary here. However, Aro Mobile is built on top of an advanced natural language processing and semantic data analytics services that basically figure out that ""Ed"" OR ""E.W."" OR ""Eddie"" might all be equal to ""Edward Wheeler"". Our predictive analysis figures out how likely your usage might be, depending on your past activity with ""Edward."" Then our system analyzes what information we have associated with ""Ed Wheeler"" and links information together. It works because it's based on your patterns -- if you regularly call ""Edward Wheeler"" by the name ""Ed,"" we help by figuring that out. There's a lot more to say, but that's one basic example.<p>You are also right that we also need to do a lot more to improve the product. We welcome feedback through our beta program, so we can continue to improve our product.",1288473041

A few months later, the C&D was lifted and license was granted. There is nothing wrong with society or government checking that all is a-OK. There isn't a conspiracy to push anyone to the stone age.<p>Ref: <a href=""http://www.genomeweb.com/california-grants-navigenics-23andme-licenses-offer-services-state"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.genomeweb.com/california-grants-navigenics-23andm...</a>",1240998472
584809,comment,584482,584791,0,0,lucumo,,,"The NYT is a site where registration is unnecessary[1]. Registration was harder to do for them than it is to not have registration at all.<p>I was talking about situations where you store data on a user and link more data to a user. Sure, you can do that using some kind of token in a cookie, but if you want to give your users a name at least some of the time, registration is easier. At that point ""unregistered users"" add more work.<p>Your other examples are more a problem with the way registration is implemented, than with registration <i>per se</i>.<p>[1] From a technical point of view. It probably makes business sense to them, although I'm unsure how.",1240998452

584805,comment,584482,584729,0,0,c3o,,,"At Soup.io (tumblelogging/lifestreaming) we initially had content creation buttons right on the front page. We figured that the best first action for new users would be to actually post something, not filling out a sign-up form.<p>But we had exactly the problem you're describing: People are so used to scanning for ""register""/""sign up"" that some even assumed we were in invite-only beta.<p>We eventually changed that to a ""Try it now -- no sign up required"" button, which works better. The wording and UI is still tricky though: ""Try it now"", ""trial account"" etc.  carry the connotation that it'll cost something later.<p>We've been meaning to A/B test a straightforward sign-up form for a while and measure effects on both conversion & retention, but unfortunately haven't gotten around to it yet.",1240998121

584796,comment,583025,584740,0,0,silencio,,,"I've had that happen to me before. You'd imagine if that were really the problem that they'd find a more PC way to tell me they don't want a woman on the team so I don't then go on a huge rant about gender discrimination, but some people have said it to my face that that is why. Yeah, it's their loss, and I don't deal with them after that.<p>I'd have to be delusional to say that discrimination wasn't a problem. I've cried my tear ducts dry and screamed my lungs out before over the unbelievable things that have happened to me that I never saw happen to any of my male friends just in tech alone. My boyfriend gets tired of hearing my stories of my frustrations over these things - he doesn't deal with anything even close to them except when I'm with him at an event (and THAT is a whole 'nother world of discrimination right there). I had to learn to just deal with some inevitabilities of being female in such an imbalanced industry. I also have to admit that in the course of dealing with these inevitabilities I've pretended to be a guy online very frequently and still do because it's just so much easier. I've also learned this nasty habit of becoming a total jackass in the face of other jackassery usually in the form of sexual harassment by people who think it's okay to harass a girl because they're behind a layer of pseudoanonymity.<p>Most men are really nice. Most men will hold open doors for me and treat me as a colleague and help me out when I'm having a problem, and I've had male friends who've mentored and supported me and my decisions over the years and more. Most of them, I would not mind working with - in fact, I would be glad to work with. But there is always someone out there somewhere who thinks discrimination and harassment is okay, and eventually, you just get really, really, really, really, really tired of them. It all builds up.<p>Can't forget that all this is on top of the annoyances in the non-tech world that one deals with every day just by being female, which is enough to drive a lot of women crazy. Once I've fingered my knitting needles and my knife on my keychain to use as weapons because an annoying guy wouldn't stop following me around saying something about taking my clothes off. Just last week, I drove around in circles near my house because there was a creepy guy in an Audi who had been following me by foot from a mall and then in his car for a very random and unlikely 5+ mile drive (think 4 left turns in a row followed by going up and down the same street for half a mile), and I went as far as to call the cops with his license plate #. How many guys can tell you that they've had stuff like THAT happen to them? Pretty rare :(",1240996523

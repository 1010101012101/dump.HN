Is there ever a point where it's OK to say ""this is wrong, we must stop""?<p>You're also assuming an extremely high degree of responsibility for neighbors. Now, I'm not going to go religiously Ayn Rand on you. I acknowledge that society is interdependent, and I couldn't have achieved as much as I have without neighbors that work together.<p>But I think you're going too far. There are things I'd like to do in my life, and for those that are most important, I'm consciously laying things out in a way that should allow me to get there. This isn't without some pain. There are plenty of things lower on my priority list that I must forgo in order to get to the high-priority ones.<p>I don't have an iPhone, I don't have an LCD TV, let alone HD. My wife and I each have a car: mine is 8 years old with 108,000 miles; hers is 7 with 130,000 miles. We rarely eat out. We don't have fancy furniture: much of it is from WalMart, as is much of my clothing. We use credit cards for convenience, and have never run a balance on them. This is not an extravagant lifestyle, this is thrift.<p>Yet I see every day people living extravagantly: leasing cars and turning them over every 2-3 years; huge houses, refinanced at 45 years old so they'll be paying until they're 75; cigarettes and expensive drinks; $900 purses and fancy shoes.<p>The result is that I have more assets. Yet I constantly hear complaints about how unfair it is that people have more in the bank, and those ""lucky"" few should have to shoulder the burdens that frequently result from the profligacy of the indebted.<p>So I make myself suffer to save. And it seems that I'm to be made to suffer later, too, as my savings are looted. But on the other side of the screen, those living high on the hog will, by virtue of their very wastefulness, get a claim on proceeds of my frugality, allowing them to continue their party.<p>How do you expect me to feel that I owe this to them?<p>You say that I should help the younger generation by helping them shoulder some of the tax burden.

Now, if you really have no clue, I can give you a mathematical intuition, so your brain understand what your ear can't hear.<p>(1) Axiom: We hear at a logarithmic scale. What we perceive to be a <i>difference</i> (or interval) between 2 notes is actually a <i>ratio</i> of frequencies. (I think biology may explain this axiom.)<p>(2) Axiom: Say you hear 2 notes, of frequencies f1 and f2 respectively. When the f1/f2 ratio is a simple rational number (like 2) or (3/2), it sounds good. When the ratio is more complicated (like 19/17), it sounds worse. (Physics can explain that axiom.)<p>(3) Definition: when the f1/f2 ratio is 2, we call that an octave. The 3/2 ratio is a fifth. The 4/3 ratio is a fourth. As a side note these ratio were basically the only ones that were used. They didn't really used thirds or sixths, probably because of their more complicated ratios, which may have sounded bad to their ears. [1]<p>(4) Theorem: There is no way in hell you can make an octave out of fifths (they won't perfectly tune together). Informal proof: this is because you can't find any (i,n) ∈ ℤ², such that (3/2)ⁱ = 2ⁿ. As a side note, you can come relatively close: (3/2)¹² = 129,75 which is close to 2⁷.<p>So, a mathematical impossibility prevents you to perfectly tune the two most basic intervals ever. Ouch. We have to compromise, then. We can sacrifice a few chords (which if played will cause severe ear damage); or cheating a little bit on every ratio, so no chord sounds outright wrong, nor exactly right; or we can try to find a middle ground between these two extremes.<p>The ""sacrifice"" strategies was originally favoured. They sounded better, but restrained what you could play. Now, we favour the ""cheating a little"" strategy (also called ""equal temperament""). They give you more liberty, but sounds rather dull on old music meant to be played with an old fashioned tuning (to trained ears, at least :-).<p>Hope this helped.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://pipolitics.com/video-streaming/kaamelott-saison-2-episode-20-la-quinte-juste.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pipolitics.com/video-streaming/kaamelott-saison-2-epi...</a> is an excellent joke on the topic.

1285318,comment,1284640,1285143,0,0,elblanco,,,"It wasn't exactly a technical field. It's amazing how many fields outside of development are very nearly impossible to test in a meaningful way. For example, hiring a sales vp, if done at the same level of problem solving as most tech interviews I've seen, would have to result in a 30% sales increase for the company. You basically have to just see what they say, if they sound like they can tie their own shoes, don't suffer from short term memory loss and have a pulse you usually give them a try and just fire them if they don't work out.<p>That's why there are so many hangups during the interview process that have nothing to do with a person's actual skill in a given area..like font choice on a resume, or little tips like how to sit in a chair or whatever. Those are all little tells that people look for in an interview, but candidates also know this, so they try to game the system by appearing confident, showing up precisely 15 minutes early with a binder full of extra copies of their resume, just the right amount of hair gel, etc. Because by and large, in fields outside of technical ones, that's how you get a job.<p>> So, was this guy vetted like this on technical merits, or did he just talk impressively to non-technical people? I'm curious to know how he slipped through.<p>But yeah, this is actually how he kept slipping through. His interviewers were hiring him for expertise in his field that they themselves did not have. Pretty much it was bureaucrats and administrators hiring somebody for a particular skill requirement. They simply didn't know how to dig more than a level or two deep. In the same way that a person can game the hiring system like I mentioned above, he could do the same for his field. Somebody who was actually in the field would have to spend a little time to figure out that he didn't know the equivalent that computers need electricity to operate. But he could talk for hours about how for example, a browser operates with DNS servers to resolve IP addresses -- and do it with authority (again, as a very rough equivalent).<p>You could even ask him to produce a plan of action for the next six months and he could produce a pretty good outline, good enough for an interview, but ask him to fill in the details and he couldn't.",1271949683

Treat your job as a good friend, don't become too emotionally involved with it. Don't just get a paycheck from your job - if you do, you are <i>underpaid</i>. Do things outside of work. If you work with computers all day and you don't do other stuff that does not involve computers, consider new hobbies that pertain to interests.

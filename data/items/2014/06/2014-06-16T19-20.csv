My understanding is that they set Sweetie up in a chat room, just like the room that the author describes.  The people they caught had to come to that room intentionally.  I am reasonably certain Sweetie&#x27;s operators were well aware of entrapment concerns and structured their interactions carefully to avoid them.  (It certainly would have been a phenomenal waste to have gone to all the trouble involved in creating Sweetie and then to have blown everything by doing something stupid in the chat rooms.  I don&#x27;t think these people are anywhere near that stupid.)<p>>  And I have no idea why you believe that the alleged pedophiles had almost certainly done it before<p>Then you know nothing about child sexual abuse.

This should be a bedrock standard but instead this catch-up is spun as MS&#x27; dedication to artists.

7901122,comment,7900533,7900533,45,0,beat,,,"The thing that frustrates me the most about this situation is the waste of human capital this represents for society. Now, I&#x27;m a firm believer that society is advanced mostly by a small minority of highly talented individuals - the intelligent, creative, charismatic, and hardworking few change the game for everyone else.<p>Now, what happens when those rare talents are born into the cycle of poverty? What lessons do they learn? Too often, their talents just get them into trouble. They find themselves caught up in crime, addiction, and the other short-term thinking failures of poverty, and thus unable to express their talent. Worse, society simply expects nothing of them. They have no role models, and they have no external motivations to be and do better.<p>Even those who can do better often simply escape, leaving the culture of their birth behind. Frankly, I did that. I was raised about one step above what southerners call &quot;white trash&quot;. My father, a tremendously intelligent and charismatic man, was constantly lured by petty crime and get-rich-quick ideas, and wasted his life. His interactions with the wealthy men he worked for generated feelings not of admiration and example, but contempt. To this day, when I&#x27;m not sure what to do about a situation, I think of what he would have done, and do the opposite. And he took a big step up himself - I remember visiting my grandfather&#x27;s farm in rural Kentucky as a child. I didn&#x27;t notice the lack of electricity or running water at the time. I notice it now. My father escaped sharecropping, but he never escaped his own demons.<p>I see the effects of those escapes now in my sister&#x27;s life. She loves living in the rural south, but is constantly brought down by the ignorance and awful habits of her neighbors. Everyone in her area (southern Virginia) who has any brains simply moves away. What&#x27;s left are the addicts, the fools, and the spiteful. Sure, it&#x27;s beautiful there, but I don&#x27;t see how she can stand living around people with so little ambition. I do, however, see how she suffers in poverty and hopelessness.<p>Me, I got up and left. I made a good career for myself, living in a nice safe neighborhood in a beautiful city, making a good income in a safe field, raising my kids safe from the things that got me as a child. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to that life.<p>But oh, so many lost souls. So much talent put to waste in jail or in the grave. This is what we allow poverty to do to our society.",1402948610

The output of emscripten isn&#x27;t meant to be maintained, instead it should be treated like compiled binary code, and recompiled from their C/C++ sources. There&#x27;s no really useful interactive debugging (although there is support for source-maps), but I usually just debug a native desktop version of a project in Xcode or VisualStudio. For emscripten platform-specific bugs the generated (non-minified) JS code is actually quite readable.<p>Finally, I had much less problems porting my code and build system to emscripten then to Android&#x27;s NDK. And if the code is already running on Native Client, an emscripten port should be relative easy, because (apart from missing pthreads support in emscripten), the limitations of running in a browser environment are quite similar.",1402948578

Having the option to bank on a secure channel for conversations you deem private is a perfectly reasonable compromise.

Product teams are created for various niches (e.g. Surface, Azure, etc.) but those teams now have a large degree of autonomy in pursuing their goals.<p>As an example, the Office team&#x27;s goals aren&#x27;t to prop up Windows as a platform by providing a sufficient but substandard product on other platforms, but rather to make a great product; as a result, Office 365 for iPad. The Surface team isn&#x27;t about making a platform to foist Windows 8 onto people or pressure tablet makers, it&#x27;s about making a great personal tablet/laptop frankenstein.<p>Likewise, Azure is (reportedly) a great backend for apps on all kinds of platforms, especially on iOS, rather than a &#x27;competitive advantage&#x27; to make sure that Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 work great with each other and only with each other.<p>I really feel as though this is the right direction for them, and that it&#x27;s producing some really great results so far.",1402948525

N-Trig&#x27;s pressure sensitive stylus technology is vastly inferior to Wacom. Sure, most people can&#x27;t tell the difference, but most artists can. Sure, artists can still produce professional quality work with an N-Trig stylus, but the experience of using an N-Trig stylus is substandard.<p>Microsoft improved nearly every aspect of the Surface Pro 3, but their switch to N-Trig was extraordinarily stupid. I&#x27;d rather have a slightly thicker, slightly more expensive device than one with a less than perfect stylus.

The volatiles that are ordinarily removed from the distillate as &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot; stay with the alcohol fraction instead.  As frost distillation is the traditional process for going from hard cider to applejack, additional care must be taken in the fermentation step, because if the Saccharomyces are contaminated by bacteria that ferment sugars to acetone, butanols, propanols, or fusels, those contaminants will be present in the final product.  They probably won&#x27;t kill you, but your hangover is going to be terrible.<p>In a clean, well-controlled fermentation vessel, as one might find in an open commercial operation, this is not a problem.  But when the process is outlawed, and the producers have to hide, often in places that cannot be biologically sterilized, this problem could occur more often.<p>But then again, it isn&#x27;t really about public safety, but about people who want to control other people.  Otherwise, the law would mandate adequate fire protection for steam distillers and establish upper limits on non-ethanol fermentation products in frost-distilled products.  Either could address the safety concern without outright banning the practice.",1402947904

The bottleneck is getting the arguments and operation into the ALU for it to run.  That&#x27;s what the cache is for.  As you pointed out, it&#x27;s horribly inefficient (in % silicon space, but that&#x27;s an odd metric, isn&#x27;t it?) in some ways, but that&#x27;s what you get for generality.<p>If you want something faster, you&#x27;ll need to alter the upper level systems to make feeding the ALU(s) easier.  (And you&#x27;ll still have Amdahl&#x27;s law to contend with -- which is a major factor even at the single-core scale.)  AFAICT, you&#x27;re asking for a system as high level as Go or MATLAB, but have it compile itself into some sequence of FPGA programs and I/Os on it. Altering those upper level systems (to the point of rewrite with a substantial amount of research work in the middle) is a lot of work, and efficiency at the silicon level isn&#x27;t enough justification for it.  Crude work partitioning by the programmer and more cores/machines often works well for those who actually need the additional performance.<p>But, there&#x27;s something reasonable on regular silicon that you may like.

7900924,comment,7900628,7900628,3,0,euank,,,"This is a bad idea for several reasons.<p>The first issue is security. Loads of text editors create temporary files (.swp, .php~, etc) in the same directory as the file you&#x27;re editing. These can render as text instead of going through php, thus revealing things like database secrets and such. Now, this problem won&#x27;t always occur and can be configured around.<p>However, perhaps the bigger problem is that this is simply a bad workflow when a better one exists. For &quot;live editing&quot;, run a local webserver. Don&#x27;t expose your playing around to the world, potentially breaking your site for others. Heck, if it&#x27;s a static site, just run &quot;python -m SimpleHTTPServer&quot; if you like. Second, for deploying, you should have a better process than &quot;sync this directory&quot;. Specifically, you should have git hooks that handle deployment if you want don&#x27;t-think-about-it instant deployment. Preferably you have CI that deploys after it passes a few tests. Using git also has other benefits like letting you have commit messages, easy rollbacks, different branches (which you can auto-deploy to test / dev / etc).<p>Basically, the problem with using Dropbox or BTSync to edit websites is that you rarely want to throw partial changes to the world, and file sync programs like to sync as often as possible. It&#x27;s a cool idea, but those sync programs simply don&#x27;t replace proper version control and CI.<p>I&#x27;d even prefer rsync if you&#x27;re not using version control simply so you can control <i>when</i> it syncs and setup complex excludes / shell scripts to run around it. You could easily have a script that runs a minimizer and then rsyncs the output while having rsync exclude any potentially accidental files. You can&#x27;t do that nearly as easily with the workflow the author is talking about.",1402946291

7900841,comment,7897244,7898011,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"I appreciate your engagement in this discussion. I think the notion of a competitive market <i>as you define it</i> [0] is inherently flawed. To quote:<p>> all participants are price takers, i.e., passive agents incapable of changing the market price<p>That makes no sense. If all participants cannot influence the price, then where does the price come from?<p>Logically speaking, once you abstract away from all sorts of fluff, everything that happens in a market is ultimately the result of the action of one or more of its participants. That is, if participants were unable to change the market price, then why would the market price ever change? Why would there be a price in the first place? The fact is that participants are <i>necessarily</i> able to change the market price, whether you want that or not. The only question is how this power is distributed and what the consequences are.<p>Having competitive markets in the sense of low barriers to entry etc. is clearly a good thing. But in the sense you&#x27;ve defined them, they are either useless or self-contradictory.<p>Interestingly, for every market, somebody has the (or at least some) power to set prices. Despite of what you write, most transactions are mutually beneficial anyway. Why is that?<p>I believe this is actually because the vast majority of markets <i>aren&#x27;t</i> efficient in the efficient market hypothesis sense, and transactions aren&#x27;t happening at the margin. For obvious transaction overhead and opportunity cost reasons, most transactions are only ever realized if they increase the total welfare not just by some epsilon, but by a significant percentage.<p>The really interesting question is how this large benefit is distributed between the transacting parties, and I would wager that the power to set prices does actually have a big influence there. That is, whoever actually gets to set the sticker price (for example) is bound to capture a larger fraction of the benefits than the other party, even if the transaction is overall still beneficial to both.<p>For this reason, I think the problem isn&#x27;t even so much that transactions leave people worse off. That only happens comparatively rarely. The much more significant problem is when unequal power relations are exploited to give somebody a benefit that is deemed to be unjustified. [1]<p>The prototypical example would be the millionaire in the desert who is near death by thirst. If she signs over her entire wealth in exchange for a bottle of water and a ride out of the desert, then clearly, this is a transaction that is beneficial to both parties. Yet only the most psychopathic internet-libertarians would ever think that such a transaction was okay in any sense. The problem was not a lack of mutual benefit, but an exploitation of unequal power relations.<p>[0] And I suppose others define it in the same way, perhaps even a large group of economists.<p>[1] By the way, this is the root of the classical criticism of capitalism: that the surplus value of labor is siphoned off by capitalists, leaving workers with only a small amount.

Panama City has less incentives to clog the roads in that taxis are universally unmetered; where taxis are paid per-minute, congestion is profitable.<p>Despite the lack of metering and a recently-introduced subway, Panama City has terrible congestion. There&#x27;s always a taxi when you want it, but a lack of regulation means that it will almost certainly be in a barely-roadworthy condition, and if you are traveling at peak hours you may as well walk. I&#x27;m told it used to be worse, that taxis would not even take you if your destination were more than a short distance away; I&#x27;ve only encountered this a few times. Also, while many drivers are honest, any sign that you are not a local is liable to result in your being asked to pay several times the going rate. This is the free market at work.<p>If you are going to invoke market forces, you need to make sure there are sufficient incentives to not wind up with a worse problem than not having a taxi when you want it. What springs to mind would be taxing taxis in proportion to your congestion problems. I am not sure that would be an improvement.",1402945356

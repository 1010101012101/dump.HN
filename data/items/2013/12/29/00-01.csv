While it&#x27;s true that the term &quot;redistribution&quot; (as opposed to &quot;distribution&quot;) implies a default where everyone gets back exactly as much value as they paid into the system, it&#x27;s also common parlance for progressive taxation and equal benefits.

I have a rather more positive (haha, pun intended) take on it given what has happened with the conventional monetary system, one that Krugman and any mainstream economist would probably agree with: the system is (largely) broken, and we must look for solutions. If Bitcoin is the technologist&#x27;s experimental solution, it is worth embracing because it delivers on change. Krugman&#x27;s solutions will focus more on government force as a constraining framework, instead of extensions of innovation---but I believe at the core of it all, the &quot;libertarians&quot; he decries are also the same people he would agree with on the utter folly of our current banking/finance dominated economy.<p>My expanded thoughts can be read here: <a href""https://medium.com/technology-meets-policy/fd097809f88"" rel""nofollo"">https://medium.com/technology-meets-policy/fd097809f88f</a>",1388278747

6977502,comment,6976924,6977392,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"We&#x27;re in a really weird state with technology right now and a lot of it has to do with the comparatively undeveloped level of models and terminology we have available.<p>Let me use an analogy. There are lots of different people who work in a &quot;shop&quot;, but they use different tools and work on different things. There are wood workers who do carpentry, there are metal workers who work with metal, and so on. Even wood work can range from fine carpentry making use of a lathe to general contracting and building simple structures by nailing together pre-made pieces of lumber. While metal work can run the gamut from machining to iron mongery and forging to soldering and brazing and can include everything from a plumber on the one hand to someone who designs internal combustion engines on the other.<p>Fortunately we have the terminology to describe these different jobs reasonably well. It&#x27;s not easy to confuse a plumber with a machinist. But that&#x27;s not true when it comes to tech. We have very little terminology in that realm. It&#x27;s non-trivial to explain the difference between a systems programmer, a DevOps automation guru, a mobile app dev, a web dev, etc. A lot of these jobs end up falling under the standard &quot;software developer&quot; heading. Even though that&#x27;s about as silly as calling taxi drivers and truck drivers &quot;automobile operators&quot;.<p>This problem of terminology extends into the tech industry as well. We have sufficiently developed mental models of things like restaurants to be able to understand the differences, and difficulties of changing, between sit-down, take out, delivery, and catering focused establishments. Yet when it comes to tech our brains go on vacation and suddenly the equivalent of a high-class sit-down restaurant switching to making pre-made meals to be sold in grocery stores seems trivial when it is anything but.<p>You get the same effect when people ruminate on how Apple should spend its huge cash reserves. With people throwing out crazy ideas of how Apple should buy into some completely different industry that would totally change the nature of the company, which is just as ridiculous as the idea they should switch to building rocket ships or submarines.",1388278429

Evidently, the NSA, a US government agency, feels that portions of the Patriot Act and related laws (including secret interpretations of such laws) do grant it legal right to collect information that is on any server of any company in the world (including servers physically located in the United States), in order to fight terrorism and other threats to national security, without the need for a subpoena or a warrant. Furthermore, if the NSA if legally allowed to do so, are not the CIA, the Department of Defense, other Homeland Security Agencies and any other information-collecting agencies, whether or not such collection is overt or covert, and whether or not the subject of such collection is aware of such collection or not, also able to make the same argument that such activities would be legal under the same legal justification used by the NSA?<p>If if this is so, then the statement you made: &quot;The government does need to subpoena AWS etc if they want access to my s3 bucket, or ec2 instances&quot; must be incorrect, or untruthful.<p>If it is untruthful, then the negation must be truthful, which means the government does not need to subpoena AWS etc if they want access to your s3 bucket or ec2 instance.<p>The judge in this case essentially confirmed the case of Smith V.

You logged in to amazon systems, and you conveyed information (data) from your system to their system.

You are putting software, data, instructing them to serve it to other parties, as in the case of s3 buckets, or instructing them to run virtual machines to perform computational operations on their computers, as in the case of ec2 instances.<p>While, as the article mentioned, there are now people in the justice system who may think the 1979 case no longer reflects the realities of electronic communications, it is still the law and will remain so until the lawyers decide it isn&#x27;t.<p>To quote from the article:<p>[begin quote]\nIn one of the concurrences, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that &quot;it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties.&quot;\n[end quote]<p>So, while the Fourth Amendment is clear about &quot;papers and effects&quot;, it is not so clear on data provided to third parties (no matter the purpose, no matter the level of protection of the data the company promised--company promises cannot supercede state or federal law) isn&#x27;t wide open for government access, in light of what the article states, and in light of the judge&#x27;s decision in this case.<p>It seems to me that while sentiments and opinions may lean toward granting more privacy protections to data stored online, the law today isn&#x27;t there yet.",1388278366

They assume that the VM can stop the world, or that the VM will be in control of all threading, or that the VM will use global variables, or that the VM can move objects around in memory whenever it feels like it.  VMs like this are like demanding houseguests that insist that everything conform to their expectations.  VMs like this are not easy to embed and do not &quot;play nicely&quot; with other software.<p>Doing the work to factor these assumptions out of the core language/VM/implementation and into libraries is not easy work, but you end up with something so much more versatile.

6977440,comment,6961824,6967354,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> This is intrinsically unfair to the patent-owners with large portfolios, because no matter how many patents are being infringed, they only get to assert a few,<p>I agree with that. That is one of the symptoms of the disease. It is preposterous for every competitor to be infringing thousands of patents held by every other competitor. That is a pathological outcome that doesn&#x27;t commonly occur in non-software industries. But we have to address the disease, not the symptom. How do we get to a world where the large majority of patent infringement in the software industry is a result of intentional infringement rather than independent invention or a need for compatibility with existing software? The easy solution is for software to be unpatentable. If you don&#x27;t like that, what&#x27;s your alternative? (And if the solution involves improving software patent quality, please explain how and also what to do about all the low quality patents already issued.)<p>> and even if they prevail, damages are limited to the patents asserted.<p>The other side of this coin is that juries are extremely arbitrary when evaluating the value of a patent, and in the case of software patents will often vastly overestimate their value. There are easily thousands of features the lack of which would materially reduce market demand for a device, and each of those features may be covered by multiple (perhaps hundreds or more) patents. The value of the individual patent is therefore necessarily quite small (and it has <i>no</i> value without being part of a device requiring a large conglomeration of such features) -- it can&#x27;t possibly be right that the value of one of five hundred patents covering a specific feature is the full hold-up value of including that feature, because that would make the accumulated cost of all the patent licenses vastly in excess of what customers pay or are willing to pay for the device as a whole.<p>As I think about it, this feels close to the heart of the problem with software patents: The patents each cover a small, independent but complementary incremental improvement that all come together to build common software. The value of the average such patent, i.e. what a practitioner of the invention can reasonably afford and be willing to pay if they were all licensed <i>ex ante</i>, is so much lower than what a defendant has to risk a jury awarding, or the hold-up value of an injunction on a shipped product, that it creates a profitable patent trolling market for entities willing to be loathed in exchange for the significant difference between the market value of a patent when licensed or purchased <i>ex ante</i> and the hold-up value of the same patent to vendors who are unknowingly infringing.<p>The trouble is the reasonable value of the average software patent is less than the transaction cost of negotiating a license for it. So they either get [cross-]licensed in bulk or (generally obliviously) infringed. But bulk licensing patents is a huge fail because it makes the quality of the individual patents irrelevant, which creates demand for large quantities of low quality patents -- which makes the problem even worse, because the more patents have to be evaluated the less resources you can afford to dedicate to evaluating each one. Meanwhile it devalues and deincentivizes high quality patents that require significant R&D to receive because they go on the same stack with the junk patents.<p>But how can you fix it? The fundamental problem is that the transaction costs of licensing a typical software patent eat most or all of the value of the patent. Trolling with bad patents is profitable because it foists transaction costs and uncertainty onto the defendant in excess of the value of the patent, so that paying more than the patent is worth but less than it costs to prove that in court becomes cost effective. Recalibrating damage awards and making it more difficult for plaintiffs to unreasonably foist litigation costs onto defendants may reduce the trolling problem, but if effective it would eat a lot of the value of most software patents, often the entire value, because the consequence of the value of the patent not exceeding (or only barely exceeding) the cost of negotiating a license would be born by the patent holders rather than the prospective licensees.<p>Which seems like a necessary outcome in any event. If the perverse incentives created by bulk licensing are to be avoided then the absolute number of software patents in play has to go down significantly, so that those remaining are the few high quality patents that justify licensing individually. I don&#x27;t see any obvious way around that.<p>[note: responding in two comments because it said &quot;that comment is too long&quot;]",1388277538

What other feasible choice did they have? Transfer the patents to themselves?<p>They could have. But the most significant choice they had and chose against was to use the patents defensively rather than offensively.<p>> Even if they did divvy up the portfolio somehow, they certainly weren&#x27;t going to keep them lying around, not after paying so much for them -- They had to be licensed.<p>The state of North Korea fails. China spends really quite a lot of money to secure all of their nuclear and chemical weapons. Do they then &quot;have to&quot; sell them to terrorists who promise only not to use them against China?<p>> Splitting the portfolio would not only make it weaker, but it would mean multiple individual licensing efforts.<p>Even if the courts don&#x27;t allow them to assert every patent anyway? What good is it to have thousands of overlapping patents if you can only assert a small number in practice?<p>> If you read the document linked in the comment I cited, no, those patents were not licensed to anybody meaningful until the auction.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about before the auction.<p>When a set of patents goes up for sale, the incumbents in the industry have three primary options to buy patents to avoid them getting into the hands of a troll that will try to shake them all down:<p>1) All band together and buy the patents. This is asking for antitrust trouble, both because all the incumbents are colluding in a way that prevents upstart competitors from procuring defensive patents that would be usable against the incumbents, and because they&#x27;re conspicuously forming an effective cartel to buy patents instead of bidding against one another. And on the other side of the coin, it&#x27;s paying the Danegeld collectively, and the sum total paid to the troll by the collective has to be more than what any individual entity would otherwise pay else the seller could sell to that entity for use against its competitors. Which encourages more trolls to &quot;offer&quot; to sell you more patents and gives them more money to procure them with. This is really the patent &quot;communism&quot; option, and is likely to fail for the same reason: You&#x27;re taking money from productive businesses to give to patent trolls, encouraging the proliferation of more patent trolls which suck more of the life out of productive businesses. That isn&#x27;t sustainable. It also defeats any benefit of the patent system to actual practicing entities, because they need all their competitors to coordinate to buy the patents of failed businesses, which means you can&#x27;t use your own patents against them or they&#x27;ll not cooperate with you and instead buy the patents themselves for defensive purposes (or do (3) to your detriment in retaliation).<p>2) They can individually take turns placing a bid on patents only when the current high bid is a trolling entity, and then use them only defensively. This is the patent &quot;cold war&quot; option. Each incumbent has to place a bid periodically to maintain their respective arsenals as older patents expire and to make the arrangement stable, but they don&#x27;t get into bidding wars with one another so nobody ever has to pay excessive amounts. If improvidently granted patents do fall into the hands of a troll who demands excessive royalties then everyone has the duty to fight the good fight to invalidate those patents to make sure that sort of parasitic enterprise is unprofitable. This also makes the patent system not useful for software because any patent assertion against an incumbent invokes mutually assured destruction, but it&#x27;s probably the most effective way to mitigate the damage of large collections of patents falling into the hands of aggressive trolls.<p>3) They can buy the patents, immunize themselves, then let them loose to a troll to be used against competitors. Thermonuclear war. Every time patents come up for auction you now get a bidding war because nobody wants to have to fight a lawsuit against a troll funded with competitors&#x27; money, which means everybody will soon be overpaying for bad patents while continually fighting suits from patent trolls set up by competitors. Meanwhile building a defensive portfolio becomes next to useless because competitors attack collaterally through trolling entities that can&#x27;t be asserted against, so instead of nominally wasteful cross-licensing you get monstrously expensive prolific patent litigation. This is the one they chose.<p>> Well, they paid billions for these patents. Is it fair to them that other infringers get away scott free?<p>Sure, you just let the competitors pick up the tab for the next round the next time a company full of patents goes bust.<p>> Google makes pretty much no money directly from Android. This inherently makes it difficult to extract damages from them.<p>So try to get an injunction. If you theoretically had a solid, valuable patent that Android infringed then Google would subsequently have the incentive to license or avoid it to prevent the injunction, and this would eliminate the duplicative litigation against every individual Android OEM, creating efficiencies for everyone.<p>It just proves their intent. It isn&#x27;t to stop these &quot;infringers&quot; from doing something wrong in particular, it&#x27;s to harass in general the competitors who do well in the market. Creating waste and mutual costs is a benefit to the larger entity that can better absorb the cost, and they know it.<p>> If different patents and/or different products are involved, the cases are not overlapping, so it&#x27;s not the same apple that they&#x27;re getting bites at.<p>It kind of is, because the thing they&#x27;re getting more chances at is getting a judge or jury who will significantly over-value at least one of their large arsenal of patents. It&#x27;s a game the defendants have to win every time but the plaintiffs only have to win once -- one billion dollar award will pay for years and years of unjustifiable patent trolling with low quality patents.<p>[note: responding in two comments because it said &quot;that comment is too long&quot;]",1388277515

He doesn&#x27;t seem to understand the use cases, or the infrastructure differences. In terms of use cases, there are plenty of analytically datasets that are strictly monotonic. There is no opportunity to reclaim overwritten storage in this case.<p>But CoW index write amplification you say? Well now let&#x27;s talk about infrastructure differences. Datomic can use s3 as a storage layer. Cold data storage is then $10/month/terabyte. And compaction is trivially non-blocking in a CoW dataset. It can be done by EC2 spec instances whenver is convenient with zero impact on the production system. Don&#x27;t generalize the experiences of a few folks running couchdb on a couple in house servers to people working with a fundamentally different approach on fundamentally different infrastructure.<p>Back to the cheap cost of cold storage, for most businesses that&#x27;s well into &quot;who cares&quot; cost territory, but having the data also allows them to preserve full lineage in the advent they discover a data loss bug in their application. That could potentially be quite valuable. One way to think of these systems is that they have integrated backup data. MySQL folks generally don&#x27;t count the size of backup sets as part of the database footprint, and common backup schedules (eg father, grandfather) provide only a limited ability to dig back into the past.<p>By way of simple argument: would <i>anyone</i> advise using a source control system that only kept the last few hundreds of commits? Why do we treat our data differently? The answer is largely one of implementation constraints: text is cheap, vcs doesn&#x27;t index the way databases do, etc. But as storage and processing densities continue to grow more datasets shift to the trivial category. As much as many HNews posters dream of being in a &#x27;big data&#x27; shop, the vast majority of startups have maybe a couple GB in MySQL or Postgres. Our status quo toolset and approach is discarding value for these folks. Maybe you think that&#x27;s fine, but some of us are going to keep pushing to enable new capabilities and advantages. Increasingly these implementation constraints will disappear as people attack them. It&#x27;d be nice to not suffer scornful surface criticisms from people who base their career around the status quo.",1388276840

There&#x27;s little reason to imagine that even digitalocean won&#x27;t be able to keep up either.<p>Personally I wouldn&#x27;t think it a forgone conclusion that google&#x27;s hosting (app engine and what-have-you) will ever mature into an industry leading product. The problem with google is that everything that isn&#x27;t search or backbone ISP is a side show in terms of revenue, so there is an absence of a culture capable of developing, delivering, marketing, maturing, and monetizing products at google. And definitely an absence of a culture capable of acquiring and dealing with customers.",1388276473

The point of writing clear code is that doing so should be a last resort and not something you force on developers in order to understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>Well, all you have to do in Rust is to look at the imports, since you have to import the trait defining the method at the call site. Because Rust modules never span multiple files, and imports must be at the top of the block that they&#x27;re used in, that import will always be before the call. There are also no global imports in Rust (at least, without using a deprecated feature flag), so the trait in question is always named explicitly.",1388275594

And I think that Rust has one of the simplest semantics around in programming languages: the method resolution rules are quite simple, because <i>there is no method overloading</i> and <i>all extension methods have to be explicitly imported to be used.</i> These two restrictions are important for maintainability: the former means that the compiler &quot;never guesses&quot;—multiple applicable methods are a compile time error—and the latter means that you never have to guess about where a method comes from, because it was always defined either alongside the type or defined as part of a trait that was explicitly imported at the call site.",1388275428

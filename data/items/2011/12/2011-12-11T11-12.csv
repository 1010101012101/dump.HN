You start with an exciting, powerful, bit of extra oomph, which is narrowly balanced between useful extra capacity to get stuff done on one side and out of control mania on the other.  This can last months or years.  Sometimes followed by a crash; and the crashes are nasty.  (Obviously there are different forms of bipolar, and not all forms follow that pattern.)<p>(Also, I don't get why you chose to link violent behaviour with mental health problems.  People with mental health problems are much more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators.)",1323604780

The biggest problem with the music/movie/entertainment industry today is that all of the backing is behind 'sellable' artists, not talented ones. Take all that promotion and marketing and brainwashing away, and you have a group of entertainers being judged on their true merits.

It's people like you who make America the great country that it is.<p>With regard to FUD on the part of the masses driving legislation, I suppose it's an intrinsic part of democracy. Which implies the following:<p>The vast majority of those satisfied by the status quo are the uninformed members of the public. On the other hand, the highly educated and those driving the economy are strong proponents of leniency in immigration, as evident by the frequent discussions on popular forums such as leading publications and HN.<p>The average American believes that more opportunities are made available to them, regardless of whether they're qualified, if they stop immigrants from coming and stealing their jobs. Which I suppose is a reasonable conclusion for an uninformed person to reach.<p>The solution? Inform the public, for after all, the US is a democracy, and it's in their hands to change the system. Explain how immigration is essential to the development and progress of economies, educate people on the implications of immigration.<p>PS: I would be interested to learn if there are any non-profits that run campaigns that aim to educate and inform the public.",1323604583

3339882,comment,3338161,3338542,1,0,duncanj,,,"Unfortunately, the article doesn't answer the question of why NY had starkly higher insurance premiums before those two rules were implemented in 2009.  I was purchasing insurance in NY in 2002-2005 and premiums were 3-4 times what they are in other states.  This was before 2009, and partially before Timothy's law, and all that.<p>I think, perhaps, the fact that NY has such comprehensive support at the low end of the income distribution, through medicaid, family health plus, healthy NY, etc., causes all of those young, healthy but lower-income people to drop out of the market for insurance.  This leaves higher-income and older people in the self-insured and employer-sponsored pools, driving up the base rates.<p>In any event, a study by the Manhattan Institute, as referenced by the article, isn't very trustworthy.  It would be very hard for them to release a study that said anything different, which to me means that there is inherent bias.",1323603787

If views are not allowed to have ""code"" in them, or are functionally crippled in some way, then presentation logic is probably going to get mixed in with the domain model, because there won't be any other place to put it. The programmer needs to have complete discretion in where they draw the line between domain and presentation.<p>This codeless view mythos arose because HTML includes a lot of rich interactive capabilities, and it's tempting to declare that these capabilities are all you will ever need in your presentation layer, but that is arbitrary and false.<p>In most other contexts, e.g. GUI programming, a codeless view is nonsensical. Code is everywhere. And if it's difficult to write nice view code, that's likely a problem with your programming language and/or your APIs.<p>Also, don't conflate model/presentation separation with server/client separation.

I bet that, if you ordered 10,000 of these, the price would fall significantly; let's say to $25,000.<p>Now suppose these things manage to run at a 80% duty cycle. That way, they run for around 130 hours a week, replacing 2.5 workers. Those workers make, say, about 2.5 x $1000 = $2500 a year, for a gap of 10:1.<p>I do not think it will take a decade to close that gap.
Firstly, you can design your factory for robots; get rid of most toilets, lunch facilities, walkways, etc. Also get rid of 90% of your huge HR staff (which is huge due to high personnel turnover). Pay the high-tech workers who do robot maintenance from the salaries of the toilet cleaners, restaurant personnel, etc, you got rid of.<p>Also get rid of the non-billable hours you have now that you spend training personnel on producing this month's product.<p>I think there will still be a large margin, especially since these things eat power (1.5kW per robot adds up) and since these robots may work slower than the humans they replace.<p>Decades, however, is a long, long time. A single decade is a factor of 64 in Moore's law, so power usage will decrease to about 80W (for the robot) + 1500W/64 (for control hardware) ~= 100W in a decade. Alternatively, some of the extra CPU power, could, conceivably, be used to speed up these robots.",1323601804

There are so many divisions and projects within these companies, all with their own goals and personalities.<p>Of course Microsoft does have some large strategic goals for its public conduct, but is it really such a stretch to allow that the Azure team wants to embrace developers outside of their traditional base? So long as it doesn't conflict severely with some other goal of the company, I don't find it difficult to believe that an enterprising manager on a mission could push through a project like this. Interoperating with a fledgling open source project for mutual benefit, even though it might not be a traditional tactic employed by Microsoft, is certainly not a particularly hard pitch to sell. Particularly if it's not a heavily politicized open source project.<p>For example, let's not forget that both Microsoft and Google donate millions each year for academic research into computing -- stuff that is way far out, such as trying to find viable quantum computers. These companies have giant market caps, and even though Microsoft may have a corporate edict to stamp out Linux wherever possible, and Google's profits are directly affected by how much creepy info they can gather on you, these companies are made up of a bunch of humans, and you have to expect that at least a few of them can scrape together altruistic and benevolent projects.",1323601682

Because he doesn't have the real application running there, he can't verify if it works or not. I fear that this might lead to ""leave the markup alone; change CSS only""-mentality from the designers because they don't want to introduce the animators for a simple design change. (You might say that changing only the CSS was the ""right"" solution anyway, but sometimes things becomes more much simpler when you can e.g. just wrap something in a div).<p>> If you have extra links that are there when the moderator is logged in, they should be there in any template with that structural element in it and then removed if the person logged in isn't a moderator.<p>Aha, but how can the designer see how it looks like for regular users? He probably wants to make sure that it looks good without the link too (maybe it's more like a button which floats). It seems like a sub-optimal workflow to manually remove the link (or display:none it) every time he works on the regular user page. (He must also remember to put it back in.)<p>> This is considerably less complex than having an entire framework/application environment installed and kept current.<p>Fair enough.<p>>  Dreamweaver <p>If an editor can make it easier to work with the templates, that's good.

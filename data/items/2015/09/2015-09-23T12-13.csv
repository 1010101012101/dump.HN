10264714,comment,10263183,10263437,0,0,krisdol,,,"Intent-driven ads are far more relevant to a site&#x27;s audience than hand-picked, static ones. They have much higher CTR and conversion rates, when done right. You&#x27;re asking sites to remove sources of income that people find relevant in exchange for ads that some higher up in marketing thinks relates to its users.<p>Not all publishers subscribe to the low quality Google AdExchange. In fact, they typically have a variety of ad bids, and the highest bidding ads are chosen for placement programmatically.<p>Edit: I just visited vogue.com. Guess who served me my ad? doubleclick. It was relevant and I bet it was programmatic. Programmatic does not mean random. Ad placement programs have a lot more data to work with than any individual at the publisher. There&#x27;s a lot more sense to it than manual prediction",1443013145

Further down that path, variables can be declared in the template, in the controller or in a directive. There is no traceability of where state starts.

10264710,comment,10263982,10264523,0,0,marknutter,,,"> I haven&#x27;t tried Angular yet but have built applications in React. In my opinion, frameworks like Angular suffer from a fundamental problem, that, it is almost impossible to gauge the problems of a new design unless you have a built a medium - large scale application with it which is very hard when you are just experimenting.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is any different with React. Building a medium - large scale application in React involves just as much complexity as doing it with an Angular app, because you end up adding a Flux implementation (and all of its boilerplate code and ceremony), some sort of routing engine, a testing framework of your own choosing, a myriad of helpers, mixins, and components that a framework like Angular or Ember provide out of the box, and we haven&#x27;t even started about the increased complexity in terms of tooling; babel, webpack, jsx trasnpiling. Add to that radical new concepts like css defined in your javascript files, the rapid rate at which breaking changes are introduced to React, and the moving target around data handling (Flux is out, Relay is in?) and you find yourself in a very similar situation.<p>You&#x27;re comparing a view layer to an entire framework. It would be more apt to compare React to Angular directives but then your overarching point about complexity would be lost. I&#x27;ve worked on large Angular apps and large React apps and I can assure you the complexity was about the same.",1443013100

With this pocket-sized device, if you are an entrepreneur or developer, you can now instantly buy or sell digital goods and services at the command line using Bitcoin.<p>For example, you can use the 21 Bitcoin Computer to:<p>instantly mine Bitcoin from the command line
sell API calls for Bitcoin, like English-to-Chinese translation or file conversion
set up your own personal iTunes-like digital goods store
reward peers for posting your links on social media
make any IoT hardware Bitcoin-rentable, from smart locks to 3D printers
The reason you can do these things so quickly is because the 21 Bitcoin Computer includes a built-in 21 mining chip (so you can easily buy things for Bitcoin) and a built-in 21 micropayments server (so you can easily sell things for Bitcoin), all accessible from the 21 command line interface.<p>You can use the 21 Bitcoin Computer as a standalone machine (it’s a full Linux box), or you can leave it plugged into the wall to provide a steady stream of Bitcoin for an existing Mac, Windows, or Linux machine. We’ve bundled everything you need to get started, including a WiFi adapter, RPi 2, power supply, USB-to-laptop cable, and 128GB SD card. And for those interested in the security of the Bitcoin network, you can even use the 21 Bitcoin Computer as a full node, as it comes with a factory-installed copy of the Blockchain.<p>There’s a lot of technology under the hood that makes all this possible: a custom mining chip, a large datacenter backend, and the 21 Bitcoin OS — the first Linux distribution that includes both the device drivers to generate a constantly replenished source of Bitcoin and a suite of programs written to natively consume it.",1443012815
10264690,comment,10262682,10263095,0,0,washadjeffmad,,,"I think a history of copyright was posted here (from Ars?) not long ago, and it showed the greatest ralliers for copyright were not original artists, but publishers and distributors.<p>With the advent of the printing press, publishers lost their monopoly over the once labor intensive reproduction of texts, so they pleaded that authors should be granted license over the products of their effort to protect and inspire creation of future works, so that they didn&#x27;t meet the same fate as the publishers. Instead, publishers, still in control of their distribution monopolies, began requiring exclusive use of those licenses, and by using the printing press themselves, saved all of the effort and expense while preventing artists from profiting beyond the transfer of licenses to them.<p>There&#x27;s more than one industry in existence today whose business is being middlemen, and with the increasing ubiquity of internet, online marketplaces, and digital appliances, it&#x27;s become difficult to justify that these rules not change except by that same old argument- but we won&#x27;t be needed if you do!",1443012815

But while I abhor things like Upworthy and ViralNova and their dozens of other clones...I at least <i>see</i> them in an average week of Internet usage.<p>Again, not a knock on Genius&#x27; mission or execution...Rap songs aside, I think it&#x27;s inherently hard to get the average reader -- especially today when we seem so much more like a consumer culture than a creator culture -- to casually use the service. I&#x27;d even argue that the value of just reading annotations is probably lost on the average Internet user, judging by the vast simplification of reading interfaces/web design that we&#x27;ve seen in all the big content platforms (Twitter, FB, Medium, etc.).<p>edit: I know it&#x27;s a little absurd to ask, &quot;Has anyone seen Genius being used?&quot; in a comment thread about a post in which a non-Genius person extols the use of Genius. But with all due respect, the OP is an academic and an editor of a book review...speaking as someone who is also an academic, academics finding something brilliant and edifying is not always an indicator of real-world use.",1443010410

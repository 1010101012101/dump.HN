On further inspection they also found a lot of chicks with zero heads (they did not survive this). The enigma was studied, and it turns out that the grazing sheep there were regularly grazing of bits of nest-bound pre fledglings probably because of a lack of calcium and/or other minerals in the local soil, and thus, generally, food chain (and dirt … grazers also eat dust every time they eat anything, which includes minerals).</i><p><i>Because the sheep were good at snipping, the amputations were often clean enough that the chicks would grow to one-limbed adults.</i><p>or:<p><i>About Indian cows: Europeans are unaware that lots of city cows in India rarely have a chance to nibble at any grass or leaves. They feed on paper, torn cloth, household scraps and small quantities of food stolen from market stalls. It was amazing that if you drop a bit of paper in India, the nearest cow turns with interest, comes and eats it.</i><p><i>Re: Well, I’m one European who is certainly aware of this :) Some of my friends watched an Indian cow consume paper and other material from a burning fire… you have to feel sorry for these animals if they are really this desperate.</i>",1400407115

7762622,comment,7761030,7761030,4,0,andrey-p,,,"It&#x27;s really interesting to compare and contrast the Cabal method and the idea of design by committee[1]. This must be one of the very few stories I&#x27;ve heard of where a committee with a rigidly defined structure actually succeeds at pulling off something creative.<p>The bits that really struck me were this:<p><i>During Cabal sessions, everyone contributed but we found that not everyone contributed everyday. The meetings were grueling, and we came to almost expect that about half of the group would find themselves sitting through two or three meetings with no ideas at all, then suddenly see a direction that no one else saw and be the main contributor for the remainder of the week.</i><p>and this:<p><i>The Cabal consisted only of people that had actual shipping components in the game; there were no dedicated designers. Every member of the Cabal was someone with the responsibility of actually doing the work that their design specified, or at least had the ability to do it if need be.</i><p>So, focusing on the quality rather than quantity of contributions makes sure that people don&#x27;t just chip in ideas for the sake of chipping in. Also, making sure that the people on the committee are those who personally have to implement these ideas makes sure that everything is actually achievable.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_committee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_committee</a>",1400406307

7762617,comment,7762413,7762413,15,0,mitchellh,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve done crossfit for over 2 years at this point.<p>This is actually one of the best written anti-crossfit posts I&#x27;ve come across. Most are anecdotal &quot;I went to one gym that didn&#x27;t focus on form so all gyms must be bad&quot; posts, which are tiring. This post goes over some great details which as a crossfitter I would say are true.<p>That being said, after doing CrossFit for 2 years I have a few tidbits of advice:<p><pre><code>  * Find a gym that focuses on form over workout. They exist, and crossfit is popular enough at this point that you should be able to find it.\n\n  * If you don&#x27;t plan on being SUPER into CrossFit, ask for substitute workouts for the gymnastic moves: handstand pushups, most things with rings, parallel bars, etc. It just isn&#x27;t worth the time learning how to do these, and you can hurt yourself. Just do something simple, they always have substitutes.\n\n  * I personally, like the author of this post, don&#x27;t do deadlifts and rarely do kettlebell swings. I am not a professional athlete or trainer, but I really primarily only heard of people getting hurt with these workouts, so I chose to avoid them. Sounds like this was a good decision. There are substitute workouts for each.\n</code></pre>\nMy goal with CrossFit isn&#x27;t to be ripped and exploded. My goal with CrossFit is to remain in good physical health based on the fact that I sit (or remain still standing) for 10+ hours per day. To that end, its been a HUGE success. The team environment of CrossFit is a great motivator both to workout hard but also to show up (social pressures). The diversified workouts of crossfit keep my strength up pretty high.<p>All this being said, listen to the linked post of this entry. It has really good info.",1400405685

To know these things requires much greater time interacting with a person, possibly in smaller groups or one-on-one.<p>People&#x27;s tastes in #1 are mostly uniform.  Someone rated highly for #1 by one person is likely to be rated highly by any other person.

My only issue is that the idea behind CF (work till failure, repetition, and so on) isn&#x27;t bad in and of itself. Doing 50 cleans isn&#x27;t bad, per se, it&#x27;s how you do it that makes it bad. And CF tends to be run by people who propagate bad form, too much weight, and that leads to people getting hurt.<p>I think it brings both good and bad things to the table, and gets loads of hate because the bad is really bad.<p>I still won&#x27;t do CF though. And it does tend to be much like a cult, as ZenPro said. That&#x27;s weird as well.",1400403651

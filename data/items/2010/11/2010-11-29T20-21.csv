Check out this possibly-false-but-accurate set of rules for teachers from 1915: <a href=""http://www.pchswi.org/archives/schools/teacher_conduct_1915.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pchswi.org/archives/schools/teacher_conduct_1915....</a><p>Sure these rules applied to every other profession as well. The difference is that they probably stopped applying to other professions 200 years earlier than they stopped applying to teaching.<p>""Guess which organizations are the biggest proponents of keeping things that way?""<p>No argument there, I'm not defending the unions, just pointing out that historically schools have been extremely abusive toward their employees. Sure the value are different today, but the psychology, social pressures, and incentives are all the same. So if the protections given to teachers were completely repealed teachers might get screwed over for different things, but there would be much injustice nonetheless. But yeah, obviously I don't agree with making it impossible teachers who are bad at teaching, I just think that if there were no protections at all then firings for social or political reasons would become so commonplace that it would drive talented people away from the field. (Granted, talented people are already kept out of teaching today by the unions and a million other policies, but still.)",1291064348

However if person A says something non-racial and person B finds a way to make it so, we act like A has committed a grave offense and needs to apologize.<p>Too many people in America can't look at an ink-blot without seeing sexism or racism or discrimination of some stripe.

I think, but I am not certain it was due to garbage collection around JSON.parse[1].<p>We ended up re-writing it all in erlang and it solved our problem much better. Erlang is much better suited for multicore, binary, and seemingly memory handling. Frankly, I really enjoyed writing it in erlang as well, but prototyping in Node.js worked out <i>really</i> well.<p>Regarding redis, we're actually storing the base64 string (list in erlang) as binary.  This sounds crazy since we could just store the binary file, but since we'd have to encode it as base64 for all the connected clients receiving the data.  This actually lowers CPU usage in the long-run.  The image is only cached in redis for a period of time then flushed (or in the future persisted elsewhere) anyhow.<p>If you're interested in using our server for your feature, just let me know @roder and I'll contact you.

So this discussion is not ""either Wikileaks is good because nothing should be secret or it's bad because some secrets are necessary"". A rational view of this discussion breaks down into two primary paths:<p>1- Is enough being done by Wikileaks (and partners and government) to minimize threats to individuals named in the leaked documents? Any rational review of the evidence to date determines that it does appear that enough is being done in this regard even without the government agreeing to involve itself (no evidence that any individuals have been harmed by the leaked documents and apparent active attempts by Wikileaks to seek guidance and pursue internal review in order to redact specific information).<p>2- What are the implications of the actual information that is being released? Ultimately, this is the key discussion topic. The rest (save #1) is just noise that some are using to intentionally minimize the relevance of this discussion topic.<p>In regards to your two choices, the first doesn't exist, never has and there's no indication that it ever will and the second, overstated first because the amount of information released pales in comparison to the amount of classified information in toto, is by all measures preferable to the only realistic alternative: minimal classified information leaked and minimal public engagement, providing ample cover for government misdeeds.

One of the junior class valedictorians (there were at least 3 girls, all very liberal arts focused, tied for the position at the time) got a C on a test that accounted for a major portion of our grade. After class on the day we got our tests back, she approached the teacher and explained to him that she had never gotten a C before and was generally very distressed about the possible effects on her GPA. He was very understanding, and changed her test grade to an A.<p>Later that year, another of the junior valedictorians was caught cheating on a test. After some deliberation among the councilors and administrators it was decided that she would receive only an informal reprimand, because to fail her with a note on her transcript about cheating (as dictated by school policy) could hurt her chances of getting into a good school (to say nothing of how it would effect her chances of receiving a National Merit Scholarship that the school loved to boast of its students receiving).<p>On several occasions it was explained to me that it would be ""unfair"" to heavily weight test scores, because many of the ""best"" students, who turned in all of their assignments on time, had difficulty understanding the material and might not be able to do well.<p>I hate to sound bitter, but even the public university I attend now (I wasn't one of the ""best"" students. I got A's on tests but didn't do much homework - didn't see the point, since I knew the material) is refreshingly performance based compared to that high school.

However, this pattern doesn't fit IT/software and engineering (hard sciences) where creativity and knowledge are required. Some of the best engineers have the worst social skills. You won't find that in other fields.<p>Then there are the entrepreneurs who tend to break rules and take shortcuts. But they also tend to prefer to hire rule followers. I used to be surprised by all the entrepreneurs without degrees who require degrees for employment. But today I think good entrepreneurs instinctively know they need rule followers to carry out their vision and provide balance.<p>The question we need to ask about education: What are we trying to produce?<p>a. Good employees 
b. Innovative scientists 
c. Entrepreneurs
d. All of the above<p>d. All of the above. The problem is... Our unionized government run education system isn't flexible enough to allow these different types of people to consciously choose their own path. Instead, in the past, it tried to turn everyone into a rule follower. Now the approach in the article is trying to turn everyone into a scientist and/or entrepreneur. The answer is to educate and evaluate different people different ways. Social skills are critical for some professions, and others not so much. Rule following is also essential in some professions, but deadly in others.",1291061562

So that's why people decide to 'drop out' and pursue their dreams. It removes some of the safety net, but even that is something that you can consciously decide to do. And working without a net is a motivation of sorts (precisely because mistakes will have dire consequences).<p>> ""White male"" is probably not the sole criteria, but if it is a consideration, then a ""White male star-up"" may make it further in the process before being considered based on its other merits.<p>Typically a VC / incubator fund will look at communication skills, people skills and technical skills <i>long</i> before any personal factors would kick in and if you ever had hard proof (by for instance setting up a false front behind two black females doing all the work) you'd be in a good position to make them look ridiculous. Another option is to set up an all minority fund where you exclusively fund anybody <i>but</i> white males and you outperform the market.<p>> The Doerr made no reference to a preponderance of ""white male start-ups"" nor did it suggest that such a preponderance was the basis for his investment preference.<p>This is a well established fact, I don't need John Doerr to give that information.<p>There are a lot of applications of people that are essentially without any chance whatsoever in every category, when you remove all of those the number of people left that are a minority of some form or other tend to of exceptional quality.<p>> It don't think it would be surprising to suggest that most people have a better understanding of people from a similar cultural and social background and therefore are more comfortable working with such people.<p>That's probably a huge factor right there. The control for that would be to have an investment fund created by wealthy people with a coloured skin and females, we'll see who they end up investing in, people 'like them' or white guys under 30.<p>What do you think they'll do ?",1291061556

1951591,comment,1951288,1951288,0,0,jackowayed,,,"All through elementary school and middle school, and in many of my high school classes, I bemoaned that I had to do tedious homework that didn't teach me anything (not in every class--mostly math, science that was primarily math, and grammar). I frequently said that homework should be optional, and if I do well on tests/quizzes/projects/papers/whatever, homework shouldn't bring down my grade.<p>But on the other hand, I think part of the reason that I have such a thorough understanding of calculus is that my Calc AB teacher required us to do large quantities of homework. And I was totally fine with having to turn in weekly problem sets in my Multivariable Calc and ODE courses senior year because I needed the homework to solidify my understanding.<p>I probably would have done the Multivariable and ODE homework on my own because I actually struggled with those classes, but I probably would have done only a small fraction of my AB homework if it weren't required. I still would have gotten A's on most of my AB tests, but I might not have had quite as solid of a foundation. I think I'm better off because I had to do that homework. So that has made me question how I feel about mandatory homework.<p>Plus, that there's the issue of students who aren't disciplined enough/don't care enough to do optional homework even if they know that that will lead them to do poorly on tests.<p>It's possible that a system where homework is optional for people who are doing well could solve the latter problem, but it wouldn't have made me do my AB homework. Plus it might breed even more resentment against the nerds who get to skip the homework just because they know the material.<p>tl;dr: I've experienced many classes where mandatory homework bored me out of my mind and wasted my time, but at other times it has helped me a lot. Also, some people will do as little as they're required, so if homework is optional, they won't do it even if they just failed a test the day before.",1291061155

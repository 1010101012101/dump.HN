4936258,comment,4932196,4932474,6,0,wamatt,,,"Many seem to be missing the point here. While native in the mobile context, has the <i>potential</i> to be faster, it's a <i>necessary</i>, but not <i>sufficient</i> condition for superior responsiveness and usability.<p>Even with the native app, the same poor design decisions are being repeated once again. For example, not caching data locally between screens - an especially egregious oversight in the context of mobile networking.<p>I think the broader issue however, is just how out of touch Mark Zuckerberg was with regards to mobile and perhaps even emerging web technology in general.<p>He eventually admitted to screwing up (great!), but then got it so wrong again, by declaring HTML5 as the culprit. The problem was almost certainly more attributable to people and management issues, rather than a technological misstep, irrespective of whether that resulted in a more palatable conclusion for Mr Zuckerberg's ego.<p>As for the Sencha demo, after installing it on my iPhone 4s it works really well, and installing it as app on the home screen makes it virtually indistinguishable from native. I think it's fair to say this is a rather significant achievement by Sencha, indeed considering it's a part time effort.<p>Which makes one wonder what a full time team, with the right leadership and resources, could have achieved at Facebook.",1355810302

Early models had a range of 1000  miles, later extended in the DC-3A to 2100 miles.  Military C47 A/B aircraft had a 1600 mile range.  So you'd have to introduce a few more hops on the map.<p>- A package would more likely have traveled via ground route, mostly ship.

4936253,comment,4935541,4936150,3,0,simula67,,,"My point was that dismissing centralized services by equating with dictatorship was useless. In a true dictatorship, the dictator rules over by means of force, and  has no commitment to subjects other than to keep the fear going. Equating that with a capitalist centralized service such as Facebook, twitter etc is not accurate since for them the product is the attention of their users and it is in their best interests to keep the users happy.<p>Now that is naively optimistic and considering that the people running these organizations are rational. I for one will happily switch to a decentralized version for a service as personal as Facebook ( so long as my friends are on it ). My intention was to balance the argument since it is very easy to take your comment and interpret it as de-centralized is the ""total awesomeness"".<p>Clearly, you have strong feelings about this, as you are working on tent.

If people need a way to introspect a SPDY connection, someone will write a tool.<p>This is in the same vein as TCP, TLS, or DNS. Developers use these technologies all the time, and it exposes a simple interface to them, but all of them are quite complicated under the covers. I don't believe that Nagle's algorithm or the UDP framing for DNS is common knowledge amongst the majority of developers.<p>Similarly, SPDY or HTTP/2.0 will expose a simple interface to developers, but internally transport the content in an efficient, if somewhat inscrutable, manner.<p>While I appreciate the sentiment that HTTP is easy to understand as it stands, I'd rather not optimize for ""developers of almost any skill level"". While it would be totally OK for you to write a HTTP/1.1 parser as a toy, it would be somewhat crazy for you to use that implementation in a production scenario.<p>There, everybody uses a small set of implementations that have been vetted: Firefox, Chrome, Apache, Nginx, etc. These guys work extremely hard to make sure that their implementation is solid not merely ""compatible-ish"". I'd rather optimize for them, rather than the beginners. I'd rather make it easy for them to write correct implementations. I'd rather jettison the ""fault tolerant enough that compatible-ish is ok"" design of HTTP/1.1 that makes their life so difficult.",1355809922

Those customers have largely remained loyal even though other online retailers have caught up in price. This is also what made Zappos very popular (eventually bought out by Amazon).

4936234,comment,4932938,4932938,1,0,vaxdigitalnh,,,"What is the computer?  The cell?<p>Python code is not DNA.<p>Even to say binary is DNA seems a stretch, and of course it's quaternary.<p>With cells, there is no single ""front-side bus"".  There is Brownian motion, geometry (e.g. at the level of DNA, A,T,C and G each have their own geometry), collisions and a poorly understood process of geometrical ""recognition"".  We know how to build circuits and registers and construct computers from them, but we don't understand how RNA builds up a cell from scratch.  We can only speculate that RNA can do this... the origin of life.<p>Perhaps Python would be a protein, but certainly not one that is required for the cell to function.  Some interesting exogenous protein perhaps.  If you want to control the essential ""cellular proteins"", the basic machinery of the cell, e.g. the enzymes you allude to, then you need to learn assembly.  Python, like an exogenous protein, only acts to influence the machinery of the cell, including the proteins within the cell: in the case of the computer, circuits, registers and an assembly language.<p>Processes could be analagous cellular processes, i.e. what the proteins may take part in, their various roles in the biochemical reactions that drive the cell.  Proteins are not the running processes, they are running the processes.<p>I think, with respect to coding, more important than the accuracy of the metaphor is simply the skill of being able to think abstractly and derive metaphors.  So just the exercise  of trying to come up with a comparison is something a programmer would instinctually do.<p>All of our attempted comparisons are likely flawed in numerous ways.  But it's the exercise of making them that makes them worthwhile.<p>Good luck.",1355809730

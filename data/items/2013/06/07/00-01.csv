5836461,comment,5832626,5834822,4,0,dorian-graph,,,"I'm a Mormon though not from Utah.<p>You still need to understand the Mormon culture and church more so. I'm not sure what you mean by being excluded (Excommunicated, shunned, offended?) isn't absolute, in fact, no one really is excluded from the church as all are forever welcome (Some extreme edge cases aside) back. This is in an ideal situation and I know that in some locations that maybe a local leader or some local members because of lack of experience, their own mistakes or whatever don't truly welcome and help someone return. I'm also curious what are some of the minor infractions that were induce someone being excluded from the Mormon community..<p>Not all Mormons hide everything from their family, friends and leaders. We're encouraged to do the opposite, actually, in appropriateness and relativeness especially so when it's something quite bad which are the things someone would be blackmailed about. You wouldn't go blackmailing someone because he didn't read the Ensign every month which is something a Mormon probably wouldn't really bother telling anyone.<p>Also, someone who is a Mormon probably has fewer things to be blackmailed about—lewd pictures, drunken mistakes, egregious offenses to others and the law, hidden relationships (Sexual or otherwise), etc. are not things we seek out, instead, we actively avoid those things and not only actions but locations (Bars, night clubs, etc.) where more embarrassing/illegal things tend to happen. This is based on what I've seen and learnt throughout my life and I'm not pretending that these are any great or completely accurate comments, simply some postulations.",1370566774

5836454,comment,5831491,5832200,1,0,einhverfr,,,"FWIW what I understand Hayek as discussing is something different, which is that centrally imposed definitions of ""good"" have very little to do with local decisions that people make.  Hayek is arguing, as I read him, against the idea that ""social good"" as we culturally construct it through centralized structures (church and state) is the goal of the economy.<p>There is a way out of this, and that is a 19th century Catholic idea (I am not even a Christian but Catholicism is interesting to me to the extent the Catholic Church is a torchbearer for pagan Greek and Roman phylosophy) called ""subsidiarity.""<p>The idea of subsidiarity is that it is <i>theft</i> for a group to accomplish what an individual could accomplish by him or herself, and for the same reason it is theft for a larger, more centralized group to do what a smaller group could do.  The goal of larger groups should be to support, not supplant, smaller organizations.  This idea of subsidiarity thus seeks to reformulate society and the economy on Aristotelian grounds, with the family household in the center (rather than the multinational corporation of liberal capitalism, or the state).  From this view, virtue and economic value are the same to the extent that people seek to live just lives, and to the extent that central authorities only seek to accomplish on their own what are fundamentally impossible for the smaller entities.<p>I think this is one reason why libertarians have associated the Catholic idea of subsidiarity with the private sector which only makes sense in terms of Hayek (I don't think that equivalence quite works but one can easily see the similarity).",1370566658

He did become the president of Turkey (I believe without an election too) but he used his powers to give his country more independence and more freedom. I'm not justifying his actions as to how he came to the power, but I'm just saying that he didn't abuse his powers and did what he thought was  best for his country. The outcome of Turkey really effected the perception about him as well, I think. Had he done some things wrong, Turkey may as well would've become just like Iran today. He obviously did some things right because Turkey is much more democratic than Iran even with a totalitarian and autocratic PM ruling the country.",1370566614

These are stark distinctions: is the information under your personal control or did you voluntarily give access to and possession of that information to someone else? In this particular case with the NSA, it's even starker: who generated the information? The NSA is collecting information generated by AT&T about activity on AT&T's private network. It strains the imagination to try to define that as an individual's personal information.<p>> The real question is ""what is the intent of the protections afforded by the Constitution and are we upholding that intent""<p>The intent of the protections was to guard against the invasive physical searches of homes and persons that had occurred under the British.

So, yes there is some demand for problem I m trying to solve.<p>2. List down top 10 blog post links which talk about Problem your product will solve and post comment on all those blogs in 3-4 lines : first two lines about the post, next two about your project & link. So, you will start getting some traffic atleast say 20-30 users daily from all those 10 blogs combined.<p>3. Start creating good relations with people who have given you these emails. Tell them something like : ""Hi, Thanks for giving me you email. I am building this product where you will be able to choose pre-made Employ Evaluation forms or will be able to edit them too. What more do you think you will need to solve your problem of Employee evaluation.

The second version, released in 1979, included the vi editor.  When Sun Microsystems formed, they incorporated BSD into their OS, SunOS.  In fact, people on the internet have asserted that the TCP/IP stack for most operating systems, including the first stack incorporated into Linux and into Windows 95, was copied from BSD's stack.  Since sharing source code is an effective way to increase the chances that two different systems will be able to interoperate on the internet, this TCP/IP stack from BSD (whose creation was funded by the US government) probably materially sped up the growth of the internet.<p>The original BSD license, which is quite close to the BSD license used by many open-source project today, was created because the owners of BSD (the University of California) believed BSD had to be placed in the public domain because its creation was funded by the US government, and the US government is prohibited by law from copyrighting its creations.  Actually, they did not release it into the public domain, but the license they chose is very close to ""public domain"" in that the restrictions it imposes are very light.<p>Before 1993, <i>most</i> of the software used for communication on the internet was either explicitly open source (i.e., under the GPL or the BSD license) or ""informal open-source"", meaning that it did not come with formal license terms, but its source code was available, and it was widely believed that it was unlikely that anyone would try to stop you if you modified it or redistributed it.",1370564911

5836229,comment,5832320,5836074,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Okay, you object to my claim that there are no contexts in which to use deductive reasoning. Point taken, I wasn't entirely clear about that. I was speaking in the context of the discussion, which was about the set of exchanges in which fallacies are brought up. This is basically the realm of policy debate and empirical claims.<p>First, deductive reasoning has a role there, though obviously it is combined with inductive reasoning. I've directly addressed how the two interact in my prior post, so I don't feel the need to repeat it.<p>Second, while there are a class of fallacies that are relevant only to deductive arguments, and certain named fallacies that have different applications in deductive contexts, many named fallacies are specific to inductive arguments, or have specific application to them. Including, as it is actually defined (versus how you have mispresented it) the fallacy of appeal to authority. \n> As above, that ""deductive argument"" generally is not going to be a deduction.<p>Yes, it will.<p>>  Your induction-based premise is only going to get you e.g. ""this policy probably will save money in the long run"",<p>The following is a valid syllogism where the major premise states a decision rule, the minor premise states a probabilistic characterization on an issue of fact of the type that would be an natural conclusion of inductive reasoning, and the conclusion follows of necessity from the premises and is not, itself, probabilistic:\nP1. If more probable than not that a person has committed a tort against another, they should be pay damages \nP2. It is more probable than not X commit the tort of trespass to chattels against Y,\nC. Therefore, X should pay damages to Y.<p>Obviously, there are syllogisms where one of the premises is inductively defined where the conclusions would involve a probabilistic statement, but this is not necessary.<p>> To the extent that there is a pure syllogism in there (""we should do that that will probably save money; this will probably save money; therefore we should do that"") the debate is rarely about its validity<p>When the syllogism is explicitly stated and structured as a syllogism, there is rarely a debate about its validity, because people rarely explicitly lay out invalid syllogisms. OTOH, in practice, the elements that are presented are only those of an invalid syllogism and that <i>is</i> challenged.<p>> I most certainly did warn against using ""appeal to authority is a fallacy"" to ignore the evidential value of exper opinions<p>Which, is a reference to the fallacy, not a use of the fallacy, first, and second, not something I endorsed, so the fact that you warned against that does not support your claim that I endorsed the use to the fallacy that you warned against, and, finally, the thing you described actually wasn't the fallacy by that name.<p>OTOH, you <i>endorsed</i> the <i>use</i> of (not reference to) what you explicitly (and inaccurately) described as the fallacy of appeal to authority to support claims.<p>> That is how fallacy invokers use it in practice<p>To the extent that thing that you mistakenly describe as the fallacy of appeal to authority is something people reference as the fallacy of appeal to authority for the purpose you suggest, it is an inaccurate and, as such, inappropriate reference to the fallacy. Its also not <i>exclusively</i> how it is invoked in practice, though certainly for every fallacy there is some set of the actual references to it which are incorrect in this way.<p>> you said the real ""appeal to authority fallacy"" was an OR of three situations, the last of which was exactly what I said it was: the notion that authorities are only probabilistic evidence.<p>Actually, no, the last was that the appeal was made in a deductive context, not ""the notion that authorities are only probabilistic evidence"".<p>> My point is that it's called a fallacy despite the authority only being used as probabilistic evidence in the first place!<p>And my point is that (in addition to misusing language in attempting to say this) you are fabricating things when you claim that I have endorsed this.<p>> Yes you did: you claimed that the debates we're referring to crucially involve deductive rather than inductive logic.<p>No, I didn't. I said that appeals to authority in a deductive context are fallacious. I did not make the generalization you make here about ""the debates we're referring to"", nor do I even have any idea what specific debates you think we are referring to.",1370564096

This is the same argument made by Prop 8 supporters in California, the same argument used by Oliver Wendell Holmes in justifying some of the worst civil rights abuses in early twentieth century. Fortunately, the ""activist"" courts of latter years have (for the most part) rejected this horrible logic (that majority has a right to put any of its ideas into law, irrespective of the rights of others).<p>Yes, our government is <i>democratic</i>: it is not, however, an absolute majoritarian government where any action that majority favours can and will be put into decree and acted upon. Democracy means ""rule of the people"", not ""absolute rule by a simple majority/plurality"".<p>Yes, we have elections, but we also have bi-cameral legislature, separation of powers, and a constitutions. We hold elections and let majority (at times a simple majority, in other cases -- like amending the constitution -- a supermajority) of our elected representatives decide which laws will pass. We don't do so because of an a priori commitment to majority, we do so because we haven't found other forms of government that respect civil liberties and other human rights to the same extent that a representative democracy would.<p>In other words, elected government is the means to an end (a society where the strongest individuals or the biggest gangs cannot violate others' rights to life, liberty, and property without repercussions), not an end in it of itself.<p>I realize this isn't an invalidation of your points: while I disagree with you (yes, intelligence agencies should be allowed to exist; no, they can not be allowed to snoop -- even accidentally -- on US citizens or permanent residents without due process), your point is salient and doesn't require making such a dangerous argument (""as long as our government is a functional democracy, we shouldn't worry about governments' intrusion on our rights to x"" where x in this case is ""privacy"").",1370564011

Privacy is a guaranteed right, not something that only criminals have a need of. Saying ""if you can't unlock it, you must be up to something nefarious"" demonizes normal law-abiding people who simply wish to preserve their right to privacy, and erodes the foundation of their rights.<p>I encrypt my stuff because if my laptop or phone or tablet is stolen or lost or rifled through, <i>only bad things</i> can come from it being accessible to the third party. It's possible that nothing bad would happen, but the options are ""Nothing happens, minor bad things happen, major bad things happen."" There is absolutely no upside whatsoever. I have company passwords, trade secrets, computer code, SSH keys, and other incredibly valuable things on my laptop. I have my own emails and email sessions, which provide unmitigated access to just about all of my online accounts. Failing to protect that means a huge downside risk with no upside whatsoever. Why wouldn't I?<p>When I travel, I don't carry the keys with me specifically for the same reason that I encrypt in the first place - in the best case, nothing changes, but in the worst case, being compelled to give up my keys could mean tremendous damage to my employer, my financial security, and my identity. I don't trust other people - especially people who have something to gain by my loss - to play nice or fair or right. It's simply a game of risk mitigation; it's not that I have anything particularly nefarious to hide, simply that I don't want to be able to be put into a position where I'm even able to allow my data to be owned by someone else.<p>It's the same reason why you use backups and exception handling - you hope for the best, but plan for the worst.",1370563693

5836173,comment,5826062,5832458,1,0,carleverett,,,"Fortunately, there is little relationship between the flight characteristics of paper airplanes vs. actual airplanes.  Stability is achieved in design aspects of the plane.  For instance, dihedral wings (upward angled) are a big factor in stability since they cause the airplane to want to level out when it rolls.  This is positive stability, vs. negative stability, which is when the plane wants to roll more once it begins rolling.<p>Lighter planes are more easily pushed by the wind, which only really ups your difficulty level during crosswind landings.  Pilots will usually have a maximum crosswind they'll allow themselves to land in before resorting to another runway - that speed would be lower on a lighter aircraft.<p>That is no reason to say that the SD-1 is not suited for beginners however.  It has positive stability control and plenty of modern safety features, so it makes a great first plane.",1370563339

And not having worked closely with her before (we were not close friends, but did know each other from around) I found many, many things that turned me off: her poor work ethic (consistently 1-2 hours late to our agreed upon start each morning, giving all matters of excuses, also lack of focus throughout the day), her dishonesty with potential customers and investors (saying someone is invested or advising when they're not), her general lack of business and sales sense, her lack of direction and focus on a strategy or target market.  I could go on and on.<p>I want to leave this situation asap.  But as an unpaid co-founder only 4 months in, is it still customary to give 2 weeks notice? Should I work unpaid for another 2 weeks? If not, should it be hourly or pro-rated based on the future salary we are supposed to take after investment?  Due to the kind of person I think she is I believe theres risk in not getting paid for those 2 weeks even if we agree to it (we do have a tiny seed investment that could cover it with leftover).<p>What have other unlucky folks done in this situation?",1370563326

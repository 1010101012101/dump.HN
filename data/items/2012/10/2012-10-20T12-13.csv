The issues are this: when you need an answer to a question about something from your bank, such as, say, a fee that suddenly appears on your statement, you can pick up the phone and find someone at the company who will at least give you slow service to answer your question.<p>But with Google and Microsoft, there is no support department. You need to know how a specific service is charged? Good luck. You need to know why a needed parameter is missing on their API documentation? Forget it.<p>Basically companies like Google and Microsoft want to toss their products out into the wild and then go back behind closed doors to noodle on something else. It baffles me as to why enterprise businesses are able to do this.",1350737774

Basically, no one is claiming the movie didn't ""spend"" $50 million on advertising, the claim is that the studio is inflating the $50 million advertising expense while hardly providing anything close to that value in return.<p>Wouldn't that be caught in an audit?

They are taught at school that a rational investment is one with an expected value greater than the price paid. I have some problems with this argument, but Ive never really calculated it before, so let us consider the numbers.</i> //<p>This para to me says he's not really looked before at why he buys tickets, he's certainly not calculated his expected returns even though - as he says - he's a statistician. That seems a bit weird to me, like a mechanic that doesn't check his own oil or something.<p>So I think he now has a reason to tell people why he buys tickets but that perhaps before [and maybe still] there was some irrationality (humanity you might call it) in there too.<p>><i>Ive also heard the belief that the lottery is a tax on poor people. I have a different view, that buying lottery tickets is perfectly rational for me.</i> //<p>At the start he says this. And then, like others in this thread, says it's about hope and dreams - that seems contradictory in some sense. It's about hope beyond the mathematically expected financial return? The cost of doing the lottery for me exceeds the entertainment value it provides but the draw of the chance to ""solve all my problems"" is very strong.<p>Perhaps not a tax on the poor but a far less easily avoided irrational expense?<p>Aside: I also like the way he presents his calculation of expected return as if it's going to turn out that the lottery makes an ongoing loss and it's going to show that he was acting rationally all along (although it wouldn't show that of course because you have to have the argument first for the behaviour to be rational, don't you; otherwise it just happens to be coterminous with rational behaviour).",1350737190

It's not true, the 60% tax rate comes from the creation of a new bracket in the income tax and the treatment of selling your startup as income. To attain 60% you 1) need to sell for more than 150k 2) count all the acquisition money as instant revenue 3) do not intend to invest. And in fact, you have decreasing income tax if you sell assets you were bound to for 2 years (5%) and increasing up to 40% (on the 45% income tax...) for 12 years and more.

While most programming languages are general enough to be applied outside of their bubble, you just find more material (books, tutorial, libraries, applications, etc) written inside the bubble of a given language.<p>The question you have, is that of the bubble.  Some programming languages have a bigger bubble, which means that by learning a language, you will learn things beyond the language, in its cultural bubble.<p>Do not confuse the density of a bubble with its size either.  Some languages are highly popular, with a lot of programmers, blog entries, books, and jobs, but are nonetheless constrained to a small cultural bubble: anybody can learn it in three month and get a job, and that's the purpose of it.<p>But you want a big bubble, with things to learn beyond.<p>So after reading SICP (which uses scheme for its example), you may want to go further with scheme or Common Lisp.  <a href=""http://www.schemers.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schemers.org</a>  <a href=""http://cliki.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cliki.net</a>  There are a lot of material, old an new in the lisp bubble, and those languages give access to a lot of concepts.<p>Then you may explore connected bubbles, at least:
- prolog for logic programming,
- Haskell, for functional programming.<p>You will also have to learn about data structures and algorithms.  There are several books about it, including Donald E. Knuth's ""The Art of Computer Programming"".<p>In any case, you will have to read a lot of books (online or paper), read a lot of programs, and learn a lot of API, some of them quite big.<p>Oh, and be sure to write a lot of programs too!  It's by doing that you actually learn what you've read.<p>But APIs often don't present any new concepts.  The best APIs are small, or require you to use only a small part for normal cases.  Well documented APIs will have a conceptual section, that is the only thing you need to read prior starting programming with the API.  The detailed API references you can read them only on the job, when you're writing the program using it.  That said, it pays having learn at least one big API well, because it helps you structure your approach to new APIs.  Since you've worked with Objective-C I assume it's on MacOSX (or iOS), and I would advise you to read all the Apple developer documentation from end to end.  Once you've done that, you will be able to deal with other APIs easily.",1350735037

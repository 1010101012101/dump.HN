She&#x27;s a pro with Word Perfect, but gets confused by simple HTML tags, and no interest, time, or aptitude to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript.<p>Last weekend, she asked for help with her website, and I was shocked to find out they still look like they&#x27;re out of the late 90&#x27;s. She does all of her editing with a 2006 copy of dreamweaver in WYSIWYG mode.<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Jekyll, but she is scared by the Liquid/markdown syntax. I was thinking of moving her to Visual Studio for Web or KompoZer. Anyone know a better HTML editor with WYSIWYG mode and modern, beautiful templates or can recommend one of these all 243 generators?",1400129988

7747915,comment,7747548,7747548,20,0,dougmccune,,,"<i>For scholarly publishing, the secret sauce - the essential thing - is a mechanism for review</i><p>I’d venture to say that’s close but not phrased quite right. The secret sauce of academic journal publishing is that we get young academics hired. If you can figure out a way for a young junior faculty member to get tenure without publishing in a traditional journal then you’re golden. But as it stands today, the name of the journal is the currency on your CV. Peer review is part of the mechanics of how that works, but it’s the prestige that’s the key part, not the review mechanism itself.<p>Tenure committees can’t read the actual papers of all the applicants to form an opinion on the quality of the research. They need some form of proxy. Today that’s the impact factor and reputation of the journal title, almost exclusively. It’s entirely possible that that will change and something else (or most likely a variety of something elses) will take its place. There are a lot of people working on alternatives right now. I don’t know what the winners are going to be, but it’s not going to be number of tweets or Facebook likes. If you want to break the existing system you have to figure out how to get a young academic without an established reputation noticed in her field and hired. If you can do that without the need for a journal at all then you can put a crack in the foundation of the industry.",1400129810

7747908,comment,7744771,7747829,1,0,shmerl,,,"<i>> You never adequately responded to my comment</i><p>Which one? About no bearing (I didn&#x27;t see what to respond there), or about risk of users downloading the whole catalog at once? I responded to that (the service can charge some fee per file to prevent such thing). Or you mean about that Netflix has to negotiate something? The discussion wasn&#x27;t about what is handed to Netflix by the publishers, it was about the concept of renting of digital goods which I find to be illogical. So please point me to the comment you want me to answer to, because I&#x27;m not sure which one that is.<p><i>> You&#x27;re taking it as a given that it&#x27;s unethical.</i><p>For me it is. I can expect that some people have different view and find it normal. After all some people find extreme Orwellian policing of society acceptable. It&#x27;s not normal for me and never would be.<p><i>> The perfect DRM would enforce the IP rights without interfering with legitimate use.</i><p>Perfect policing system would prevent all crime without interfering with legitimate activity and without suspecting innocent people. I doubt such thing can exist. Increasing policing to extreme levels of total surveillance is not perfect policing because it equals to suspicion by default and it clearly interferes with legitimate activity. That&#x27;s what DRM is. <i>Overreaching preemptive policing</i>.<p>I.e. the logic of DRM goes like this:<p>1. All users are potential thieves.<p>2. We need to prevent all of them from doing anything that is not authorized.<p>3. Let&#x27;s build some technical measures and deploy them on users&#x27; systems and devices (since there is on other way to achieve the goals of #2).<p>4. Let&#x27;s enjoy piracy free world.<p>They eagerly do #3, while #4 obviously utterly fails (it doesn&#x27;t stop them from doing #3 for some reason as we discussed above). Now, I see huge problems with 1-3. Firstly, all users are assumed criminals. It&#x27;s insulting and disgusting and it&#x27;s not comparable to a lock on a store or tags like you said. Because of #3 - i.e. users&#x27; private digital space is invaded for the sake of deploying the enforcement of all these policies.<p>Imagine some police claiming, that all people in the country are potential criminals, so they need to invade all people&#x27;s houses with police cameras to prevent any potential crime. That&#x27;s what DRM does in essence. House is one&#x27;s private area. One&#x27;s computer / system / program one uses is one&#x27;s digital private area. Invading it with preemptive policing measures is unethical and overreaching and prone to all kind of abuse.<p><i>> And yet you haven&#x27;t even attempted to use logic to defend your claim that it&#x27;s unethical.</i><p>See above, I expanded on my previous brief explanations which I assumed were sufficient.",1400129559

It was the wrong model but it took ~15 years to figure out that.<p>The problem with &quot;beginner mode&quot; is who decides what goes in it? You want what you had 10-15 years ago. Why is that the right level? Maybe it should support 1000 lights instead of 4? But that would require using deferred rendering under the hood. Maybe it should support shadows, oh but which kind as their are 10-15 techniques for shadows each with their own tradeoffs. Maybe you want it to support normal maps, or opacity maps, or specular maps, or glow maps. Maybe it should use physics based lighting because that&#x27;s far easier for artists.<p>That&#x27;s the reason all of that cruft was pulled out. OpenGL is no longer a 3D library.

You haven&#x27;t proved that yet, you merely made an analogy to a police state.<p>> treating all users as potential criminals by default<p>The perfect DRM would enforce the IP rights without interfering with legitimate use. Such a perfect DRM would not, in fact, treat users as potential criminals. Certainly not any more than, say, merchandise tags in retail stores. I doubt you rail against those.<p>What does treat all users as potential criminals is those unskippable FBI warnings at the start of movies. But that&#x27;s not DRM.<p>Granted, DRM implementations in general are flawed, and those flaws do impact legitimate users. But that&#x27;s not always true.

Which is to say, it&#x27;s never stopped me from enjoying my movies or TV shows the way I wanted to. Granted, I&#x27;ve never wanted to watch my TV shows on, say, an Android device, but the ability to view iTunes content on an Android device is not something I purchased the rights to in the first place.<p>> Why not?

The inevitable competing interests of a stable base to support on one hand and the need for the latest features or hardware support on the other are very real even for Linux.<p>Need to run proprietary software on Linux? The supported distro is often still RHEL5. If you are lucky its RHEL6, but that often does not include RHEL6.5. The same goes for hardware driver support. I use something regularly that only supports Debian, but the version it supports was already known as Old-Stable at the time of release and its now Old-Old-Stable. (And its only through luck that its not Debian Old-Old-Old-Stable like it was originally going to be) Not every commercial linux vendor falls into this habit, but enough do that its a very real problem. Often you have conflicting requirements from different vendors, or even for different applications from a single vendor.<p>Think this is limited to proprietary software... Which version of python are you running? If you answer python3, do you also have python2 installed as well?

If I open up an Incognito window right now and go to a site I&#x27;ve never visited before, they couldn&#x27;t serve me targeted ads, because without cookies they&#x27;d have no reliable way of knowing that I was the same 111.222.111.222 that connected a few days ago. But now, AT&T could set up a server that ad networks can call out to, that can return a browsing profile if queried with an IP address. You&#x27;ve given them permission to do that. As far as I know, Tor is the only way to circumvent this... and with the forthcoming FCC rules, Tor traffic could be significantly rate-limited. This is a pretty big deal.",1400127036

Google doesn&#x27;t ever guess how you wanted to send it, so they can&#x27;t guess wrong.<p>Well, that&#x27;s potentially misleading. Hangouts (at least, the Android app) does show an icon showing how the message will be sent, but it sets the default based, I&#x27;m fairly certain, on the last message sent either direction in the conversation with the recipient (I do know it gives you a message explicitly telling you when it changes the default and why.)<p>You <i>can</i> tell it to send by a message other than the default (there&#x27;s a button right on the main UI), but it <i>does</i> guess.",1400126826

   x <- getSomeData
   y <- computeWith x

   return z<p>Let's say you have here straightforward imperative code. Of course, a real example would be more complex. But suppose x is now a list and you want to vectorise computeWith. Put your x in a box/monad, let's call it Parallel. Define return and bind to be parallel (bind = par . fmap, or something), and that's it. Transparent parallelism.<p>Maybe it does numerical algorithms, and you want x to be an interval, or a tuple (value, error). Again, define the corresponding monad. Same thing with non-deterministic computation, amb-like operators, passing state between calls... The code that calls them stays the same.<p>It also provides type safety for operations. For instance, some Haskell libraries allow programmers to specify a network protocol with monads, then write servers/clients that are <i>statically</i> checked to be correct. All sorts of things like that.<p>Conceptually, a monad is a box with a tag on it (the name of the monad), and your rules for (1) putting things into it, and (2) applying functions to what's inside. Plus compile-time guarantees that you can't do weird things with them, like mix tags and stuff.",1356335767

4962221,comment,4961246,4961937,7,0,dizzystar,,,"I vividly remember my first foray into real programming a year and half ago. Trust me, just getting Python to install and compile was lesson enough. It was months before I learned how to use the Windows command line. To a total beginner, especially one who is only familiar with Windows, path variables and stuff like that is absolutely frightening. It also doesn't help that the documentation for many programs is Linux-only.<p>If you can't get someone started with the following steps:<p>1- Go to website<p>2- Download and press next until the prompt says ""Installation Finished.""<p>3- Click here to create a file and save the file on your desktop.<p>4- Press ""Run.""<p>5- See ""Hello, World.""<p>You already made it too damn difficult for week one.<p>All that other stuff is secondary. Getting the words ""Hello, World!"" (much less getting the screen to show 1 through 10 without dropping into an infinite loop) to show up w/o supervising the student is a huge victory. I can't tell you how long it took me to understand while and for loops, but it wasn't one or two days.<p>Getting someone set up and running with a semi-significant website is an unrealistic goal to accomplish within a few months... well, if you want that site to be reasonably coded, that is.<p>People with lots of experience forget that the basics, for a total beginner and near technophobe (as I was 18 months ago), is very difficult. The real ""oh, crap"" moment came for me when I was first exposed to Emacs. I complained that, in today's day and age, it was utterly fucked-up that some stupid class would suggest you don't use a mouse. I was told that that statement was probably the biggest indicator of my newbie status than all the horrid code I could demonstrate up to that point. Just remember that people aren't ready to learn a bunch of new tools and they aren't ready to give up familiar tools at the start.",1356335398

A few thoughts:<p>- My 8 y/o just got an iPod touch. The other just play on the family iPad. I would definitely want an app that had some sort of shared/multi-user account system.<p>- For smaller kids, you need an easy UI. A lot of kid games get this horribly wrong. Make sure to test it with your age group.<p>- It sounds old school, but adding some printing capabilities is not a bad idea IMO. Printing a chart for the fridge is still popular.<p>- without delving into a debate on parenting philosophies, there are chores my kids donot for pointsbecause <i>they are required</i>. They have to empty the dishwasher and keep their room somewhat clean. They don't get a gold star for doing itrather, they lose privileges if they don't do it(or complain longer than the chore would've taken). All that to say, I'd like to be able to assign/track weekly chores for each kid without having to assign a prize per say.<p>- We also keep a keen eye out for random acts by the kids. We call them ""servant points"" or ""polite points"" and they are very ad-hoc. It's usually things like being very nice/polite to a stranger or clerk, being exceptionally caring to a sibling, or making a gift or piece of art for a friend or grandparent. It would be cool to keep track of these without the kids thinking there is a reward at ""X points""<p>Hope that helps",1356335132

  discriminate among customers with different willingness to
  pay is to steer them towards different sets of products
  when they search within a product category (i.e., search
  discrimination). Our main contribution in this paper is to
  empirically demonstrate the existence of signs of both
  price and search discrimination on the Internet, and to
  uncover the information vectors used to facilitate them.
  Supported by our ndings, we outline the design of a
  large-scale, distributed watchdog system that allows users
  to detect discriminatory practices.

It doesn't seem to be enough that Half-Priced Books themselves refrains from engaging in a parallel-import scheme. The strong version of the argument, at least, seems to be arguing that the first-sale doctrine doesn't apply at all to books that were imported without the publisher's consent. So not only would parallel importation violate a copyright holder's rights, but so would subsequent domestic resale of any such book. So e.g., if I sold Half-Priced Books a book I bought in Europe (which I've done), and they resold it, both those sales would be illicit, absent publisher consent.<p>Obviously the real target of the publishers' suits is <i>cheaper</i> versions of books (mainly textbooks). But I don't see how the arguments they're making can be limited to that case, and wouldn't also sweep up a whole bunch of other reasonably common cases where people sell books in one country that they bought in another country. Some examples: estate sales of people who grew up in one country and died in another one; resale of books bought on trips; small-scale independent importation and sale of books that were never published in the U.S. (e.g. novels in the original French/German/etc.). Heck, as an American expat in Denmark, I fairly routinely sell U.S.-bought books in Denmark or vice versa, depending on where they happen to be at a given time and how full my suitcase is.<p>The more suspicious part of me suspects that, while parallel importation of cheap textbooks is their main target, they wouldn't <i>really</i> mind an outcome that banned those other resales, either, and looked more like a region-coding system. For example, one easy-ish thing Half-Priced Books could do to keep safe would be to filter by ISBN, only stocking books with ISBNs indicating US publication. That'd have some false positives (some foreign-published books are imported with the publisher's blessing), but it'd be more feasible than attempting to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a particular book had undergone an authorized domestic first sale.<p>An alternate statutory fix that targets only the narrower case could be to legislate: 1) resale of any lawfully owned book in the U.S. is legal, regardless of where it was first sold; but 2) large-scale [for suitable definition] parallel importation with commercial intent is separately prohibited.",1356332626

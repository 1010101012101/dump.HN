In particular instances, this infrastructure degradation has been greatly exacerbated by decisions to save money in the short-term.  My personal opinion is that this is all part of a decades long rightward shift away from &quot;big government&quot; and willingness to pay for proper maintenance of public works.  2008 was a wasted opportunity to combine much needed infrastructure investment with fiscal stimulus.<p>There is no question a lot of work will need to be done over the next decade.

The short version is that there was a change in Congressional procedure in the 1970&#x27;s that eliminated the secret ballot for Congressional voting on bills.<p>The downside of this is that lobbyists, for the first time, could know for sure if the money they spent trying to get a vote from a specific member of congress panned out or not. Prior to this change, a member of congress was able to vote their conscience, with no way for lobbyists to actually know how they voted.<p>So, the theory is that going back to a secret ballot could weaken the ability of lobbyists to buy votes. It would be difficult, of course, to change this, since going to a secret ballot would also prevent ordinary citizens from seeing how their elected representatives actually voted.<p>A video that goes into more detail: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ4tTj6Pe_E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ4tTj6Pe_E</a>",1454864078

Lead was commonly used in the middle ages and not everyone suffered from the neurological damage that lead can cause.<p>Statistics are the best tool we have but it&#x27;s also important to realize that when the incidence rate is low enough, you need a lot of data for statistical methods to be reliable. We see this in A/B testing of conversion rates. If your base conversion rate is only 0.1% and you are looking for a 15% lift (e.g. 15% higher chance of lead poisoning), then you need a sample size of over 700,000 for each branch (i.e. 700,000 kids &quot;exposed&quot; to lead and 700,000 not exposed).

Unfortunately, the French wanted back their pride and their colonies and refused to support the Marshall plan without them.  So we turned our back on a people who wanted to be independent for politics and a desire to buttress Western Europe against communism.[2]  We then followed the French in after their fiasco at Dien Bien Phu to fight the spread of the communist menace.<p>For the longest time I thought the Vietnamese were the biggest losers in this.  They got their independence, but down a path closer to North Korea instead of South Korea after much loss of life.  But now I think America was the biggest loser. We lost a cornerstone of our culture: military service.  We killed the draft and a generation has been inoculated with the attitude military service is for poor people without other options.  The military has begun to privatize and isolate itself from America.  Fewer and fewer people serve.  Many people serving in Iraq were paid, foreign contractors.  Debate about the military is nonexistent.  Everyone “supports the troops,” but the wars are either patriotic or evil, with little discussion of execution and goals.  It saddens me and makes me think of Rome at the end of the Republican period.

Isn&#x27;t bottled water safer than tap water?<p>> No, not necessarily. NRDC conducted a four-year review of the bottled water industry and the safety standards that govern it, including a comparison of national bottled water rules with national tap water rules, and independent testing of over 1,000 bottles of water. Our conclusion is that there is no assurance that just because water comes out of a bottle it is any cleaner or safer than water from the tap. And in fact, an estimated 25 percent or more of bottled water is really just tap water in a bottle -- sometimes further treated, sometimes not.<p>> 2. Is bottled water actually unsafe?<p>> Most bottled water appears to be safe. Of the bottles we tested, the majority proved to be high quality and relatively free of contaminants. The quality of some brands was spotty, however, and such products may pose a health risk, primarily for people with weakened immune systems (such as the frail elderly, some infants, transplant and cancer patients, or people with HIV/AIDS). About 22 percent of the brands we tested contained, in at least one sample, chemical contaminants at levels above strict state health limits. If consumed over a long period of time, some of these contaminants could cause cancer or other health problems.<p>Don&#x27;t forget also that there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of plastic waste with bottled water, and the cost is enormous. The pure tap water I drink is cheap enough that I also use it to bathe in and water my plants. Even purified tap water isn&#x27;t that cheap.<p>This price difference means there is a strong business interest to privatize water. (See also <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_privatization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_privatization</a> ). One of these companies is Nestlé Waters. Nestlé, like other private water companies, are bringing in loads of bottled water to Flint. This has the dual purpose of humanitarian support, and getting the idea across that bottled water is a solution over untrustworthy city water.<p>What an amazing coincidence that Deborah Muchmore, the wife of Gov. Rick Snyder’s ex-Chief of Staff Dennis Muchmore, was also spokesperson for Nestle Waters in Michigan.

The Code is only an abstraction but it is the only way to communicate the abstract ideas, never mind there&#x27;s different forms of code. Try to code to understand complexity, that the complexity is the reason that &quot;Programming&quot; is bigger than school. I don&#x27;t mean run-time complexity, but that is an important bit.<p>The code is just one of the real-world applications of programming, it&#x27;s secondary to problem solving, but useful enough at that. It&#x27;s well enough defined in the mathematical sense to be taught as a formally structured, rigorous generality (Theory). It&#x27;s highly developed and abstract enough to go a long way with intuition applied to immediate problems (Practice). Recurse, apply code to code. Dont&#x27; forget the disciplined mantras: RTFM, KISS DRY ...<p>Preferably it shouldn&#x27;t even be a single class. Just like everyone has to learn about numbers, matter, elements or cells, it should be important to teach logic as the very basis on the search for boolean truth. Tie in self modifying code with evolution.<p>Instead of just introducing calculators in math, introduce python, Matlab, R, all of them at appropriate times. As a prime example of applied CS that&#x27;s relevant to about any teenager with a smartphone, explain the graph theory that they are the data in.<p>It all depends on the children being on an appropriate level already when they enter elementary school. That depends on the knowledge of the previous generation. Therefore it&#x27;s a slow progress, that picks up every iteration.

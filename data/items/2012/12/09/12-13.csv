4894621,comment,4893755,4894470,5,0,mattmanser,,,"I did Philosophy as a degree and pg's essay, which I read a while ago, was one of crystallization, a total clarification of something that had been bugging me for years.<p>I personally believe that Philosophy is the place where amateur thinkers reside until a discipline matures and breaks off. Philosophy is thinking without the effort of doing. First it was Physics, Law, Chemistry, Biology, Medicine and we are now seeing Psychology and Sociology departing Philosophy, taking morality and personal identity into the realms of actual science instead of thought experiments. Soon Philosophy will be left with its history and debating the meaning of words. CS and Maths have taken all the interesting logic questions away from Philosophy for example.<p>I believe what pg advocates at the end has already happened, is always happening to Philosophy. The general truths philosophy helped discover are the sciences, it just that as we get to answering the general truth the philosophers step aside for people who actually do.<p>Most previously interesting philosophical questions are now interesting scientific questions. There's not much left for philosophers to actually talk about.",1355057840

Not just computers but car audio, telephones, what would later be called home theater, any line of business they entered, they jumped in both feet.<p>Its almost noteworthy what they didn't stock.  They didn't stock much in the line of non-electronics raw materials and power tools, so if you made a subwoofer for your car you'd need to buy the wood and saws elsewhere.<p>It was very popular and was very profitable, at least compared to now.  There's probably a greater entrepreneur lesson here that your customers don't ""buy things"" they ""do projects"" and every different place they have to visit to do a project probably costs about 50% in sales, or at least a ridiculous number.",1355057751

I drink it several days a weak, in part for the general anti-oxidant health benefits, in part for the caffeine boost. But I feel like it sharpens my brain to use my available energy better, more effectively, so perhaps unlike most caffeine-consumers I tend to drink it only when I already feel fully rested. It doesn't seem to provide extra energy when my brain is already tired. In fact I fear in those cases it just prevents me from taking a quick nap which helps much much more to recover my brain energy. That's my experience with green tea so far -- I definitely want to explore it more.",1355057718

The release of the iPhone 5 doesn't suddenly make my iPhone 4s a useless piece of junk. I can continue using it until it dies and I need to replace it. Similarly, if you're doing SL work, your stuff isn't going to suddenly stop working. Your current copy of VS won't magically stop compiling SL code. Continue to use SL if it works for you. SL seemed to only have mild success as an intranet technology, so my suggestion above is valid.<p>This problem doesn't go away with open source, since projects can die and non-backwards compatible versions can be released.

That's probably why the adoption rate is quite high.<p>EDIT: Just to clarify, we're seeing much more credit card orders coming up recently so it seems that the market for Bitcoin is quite limited.

The Thirty Years' War destroyed a third of the population of Germany, and back through history there have been terrible wars much of the time.""<p>>""And even in prehistoric times, as many as a quarter of the men in a society not infrequently died in wars. So it's actually a new thing and something that's developed in the least 60 years and especially the last 20 years. And we can talk about why it is, and Steven Pinker will have more to say about that also, but the big change is that people are finding other ways to solve their problems, not through war, and we're seeing an actual shrinking in the number of people killed worldwide.""<p>That is to say that the source you found is making the claim that the reduction has happened in the last 20-60 years. Read that again: ""So it's actually a new thing and something that's developed in the least 60 years and especially the last 20 years."" Is that not the same thing I said: ""We haven't had a global conflict in 60-odd years (and yay for that), but we had two global conflicts in the last hundred years."" In fact what is said in this interview is pretty much what I said in my post.<p>>It doesn't much matter what you choose as ""current period"", because war and violence has been on the decline for quite a long time.<p>Yes it does, it really matters what you choose as your current period. Your own source backs me up on this.<p>>It's pretty annoying to try to have a factual discussion and get replies that are nothing but hand waving and anecdotes.<p>Large scale violence like WW2 is not really an anecdote but in fact a large chunk of data.

If I do these two things, my mind feels stronger for longer, more often at its best.

They seem to extol the importance of Quality, Leadership, Creativity, Teamwork, Loyalty, and a host of other organizational virtues. But they do so in such simplistic terms as to send an entirely different message: Management here believes that these virtues can be improved with posters rather than by hard work and managerial talent. Everyone quickly understands that the presence of the posters is a sure sign of the absence of hard work and talent.""",1355055906

With ""ondemand"" your CPU runs at half speed until you've stressed it for a bit. So if say, switching to another desktop takes 0.1 cpu seconds, but the threshold is that the CPU must spend 0.5 seconds working before it kicks into full performance then all those UI actions might only execute at half speed.<p>So personally, I have my desktop CPU (i7) running at performance setting. That was clearly noticeable for me for short bursts of activity. It's possible you could settle on doing that for just some of the cores (I don't know if that makes sense, since they're in a single package).",1355055846

In order to maximize the chances of a process waking up to warm caches, the scheduler always attempt to wake up the process in the core that was most recently running it. If that core is not available then it tries another core on the same package before it tries other packages (if there are many cpu packages).<p>However, the kernel has other real world priorities than just trying to keep a single process throughput as high as\npossible. It must also be fair to the other processes while keeping the current consumption low and as many cpu cores powered off as possible.<p>Because the kernel has to work with different workloads ranging from low-end not-so-smart phones with a battery to a supercomputer with it's own nuclear power plant, there are compromises to be made. There's also a lot of compile time and runtime configuration options you can use to tweak the kernel to your particular workload.",1355055457

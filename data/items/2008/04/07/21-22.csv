157234,comment,156177,156538,0,0,cturner,,,"<p><pre><code>  If it is wrong to force some individuals to give up\n  opportunities and wealth in order to benefit others;\n  is it not then also wrong for a child to be equally\n  or more deprived by the circumstances of their birth?\n</code></pre>\nIn the situation of the former, an individual has had something and then that has been taken away from them. In the situation of the latter, it is a case of the child having not had something given to them that you judge to be fundamental.<p>The word 'deprived' is interesting. ""Lacking in advantage, opportunity or experience."" The child is deprived because they have not been given one of those three things.<p>Thus, these scenarios do not correspond.<p><pre><code>  The two are not identical but they have enough in common\n  to make it a very valid question.\n</code></pre>\nThey're fundamentally different. The uncomfortable feeling you got that caused you to write the above sentence might have been used to better effect.<p><pre><code>  An irresponsible parent is stealing their child's\n  future away\n</code></pre>\nYou're deliberately being sloppy with the language to further a broken conclusion. Stealing implies property that has been taken away. That's not what's happening here.<p>The dancing is all yours, and this is the second post in a row where. Semantic tricks do not thrust an argument beyond logical barriers.<p><pre><code>  either deprivation due to circumstances of birth is\n  wrong or it is not -- regardless of whether the\n  possible solution of wealth distribution might be\n  itself wrong\n\n  I don't have a problem with debating these\n  solutions -- I find estate taxes an elegant\n  compromise\n</code></pre>\nNo. It is not your place to steal from people, nor to get the government to do it on your behalf and then pretend it's any different.<p><pre><code>  That is self-justifying sanctimonious BS of the first\n  order.\n</code></pre>\nIt's very easy to throw nasty names around.<p>Your frustration at seeing potential gain go to waste (the child) and consequential suffering on the part of that person is clear. Please - try to see where I'm coming from.<p>I want a situation where as many people get good education, health care and moral guidance. However, government is a mechanism that is both poor and dangerous when it is given charge of these things. Poor because it is not subject to the brutal honesty of market forces to keep it in check, and dangerous because it uses every bit of power that it is granted to (in some measure) line the pockets of the people involved in its running and self-perpetuate at the expense of our freedoms.<p>Government creates dependance on itself, steals our liberty, and poisons minds such that when good people identify a problem they wrong assume that it's the government's responsibility to fix it rather than their own. It's not.<p>If you want to improve the lot of a particular grouping of people, then there are things you can do like finding ways to sponsor people, finding charities that actually make a difference in things and supporting them, or getting involved in things that make a difference yourself.<p>But actually, in order to do good you don't even need to go that far. If we go out into the world, be effective in our careers, have a family and raise them well enough that we are improving on the contribution of ourselves and our spouses, that will actually make a positive difference because we'll be growing a better next generation and creating opportunities for others through our economic activity.<p>Powerful government is the enemy. It is wasteful, inherently corrupt and hampers the ability of honest people to do what I describe in the above paragraph.",1207604776

157223,comment,157073,157073,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Yep, C++ is unnecessarily complex, suffers from bloated syntax, and is almost as hard to read for a compiler as it is for a human. The point the author has missed is that it's fundamentally not that flawed as a C replacement for projects where C outgrows its usefulness.<p>Okay, so it's essentially destroying itself as a general-purpose language with the complexity and idiosyncracy of some of the additions; a decently standardised ABI would help for embedded stuff. <i>But on the whole I'd rather use std::vector<> than malloc() and free()</i> when it's impossible or exceedingly impractical to use my favourite Lisp, or Ruby if I'm feeling imperative, or Java/C# if someone's forcing me.<p>Yes, you need to know what's going on under the hood, but it can save you a lot of micro-management that slows you down in C. I've come to realise that you have to treat C++ as exactly what the name suggests: a step up from C. If you treat it as anything more, you end up building template empires. Been there, done that, realised it was a bad idea. I'd still pick it over C though.",1207604002

To learn the basics of the language either spend money for Learning Perl (which I would not recommend you do) or use the online tutorials and websites.<p>Honestly though for web development, unless you either have a legacy Perl code base you have to work with or are already a Perl guru, nearly every other option for web programming will run faster and have lower maintenance costs (in time and effort) than Perl.<p>Since you know PHP and have dabbled with Ruby and Python, why not take a look at Seaside Smalltalk or PLT Scheme?<p><pre><code>  Seaside: http://www.seaside.st/\n  PLT Scheme: http://www.plt-scheme.org/</code></pre>",1207603986

The media is all about hype and thousandaires don't roll off the page.<p>The details: the acquisition price was $5 Million which was made up of $2 Million Cash and $3 Million Stock.<p>There were 3 founders, Harjeet Taggar, Kulveer Taggar, Patrick Collison. Each founder held 20.89% of the company at the time of sale. YCombinator held 4.38%. Paul Graham personally held 0.96%.<p>20.89% of $5 Million is $1,044,500. Of course they only have 40% of that in cash and the other 60% is in stock. The stock was $2.69 the day the deal closed. It's now trading at $2.40. If they still have their shares, they are worth 10% less which is a loss of $62,670.<p>That is all before tax. Factor in capital gains tax of 10-15% before the stock drop and you are already out of millionaire territory.<p>On an unrelated note, each of the founders are now making a base salary $100,000 at Communicate.com.

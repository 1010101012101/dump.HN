What iPhone made, is people demanding pretty UIs from all their phones, which is a step on the right direction.  Still, there are plenty of things that you cannot do with the iPhone.<p>But as far as businnsess paradigm shift,  iPhone has been a disapointment.  Look at the latest update, it bricks your unlocked device, cannot do song to ringtone convertion,  (you can with many european phones), etc. etc.   Either ATT has Apple by the balls,  or Apple just doesn't care at all for the user, and tries to screw them as much as they can.",1191199458

The business world seems much the same. Luckily just like in poker, if you keep getting a disproportionately large number of tickets, and keep drawing over and over, your chances of winning approach 1.\n",1191198603

With Linux and Mac, things look terrible without font smoothing.<p>See this post for an explanation of the fundamental difference between Mac and Windows font smoothing:  Mac tries to render as closely to the printed typeface as possible and Windows tries to look good onscreen.\n<a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000885.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000885.html</a>",1191198264

That seems to trigger most of the emotional/regret glands associated with the send button, it stores the content of the message verbatim, and you can review it in the morning and really send it if you feel the same way. I also have Eudora configured so that it only sends mail once and hour so that even though I have hit the send button I typically have some time to experience the ""l'esprit d'escalier"" or ""I wish I had said this instead"" triggered by the send button. \n",1191197290

Very often, it's easy to overlook the flaws in something because we have a viewpoint that makes them look smoother than they really are. Reductio ad absurdum grabs your head and jerks it to an unnatural angle where you're looking at the flaw head-on. This precise case is not likely to happen in practice, but that doesn't matter, because the value of the situation is in helping us see a problem.<p>If you want to see an example of where this approach might have helped, look at the children convicted of making kiddie porn for taking cell phone pics of themselves.

My guess is smart people are leaving mostly because of the environment and not because of pay and benefits. When those smart people leave, theoretically the quality of the product suffers and overtime the competitor with better people wins. If MS profits go down over time, and investing in things like Azure and Bing and Entertainment (all which loose money), I don't see how they can continue to throw money at the talent problem. But man if I could get paid more AND work in a better environment (one where I had an impact) I would go for it in a heart beat. So in that sense money DOES matter.

The more viewers adopt a bandwidth-superior format, the less terabytes of data to stream, the less the cost of running YouTube. They have absolutely no benefit from any kind of ""platform/api lockin"" to H.264 or any other video standard, only that there are less bits to stream.<p>I don't see how it's an ""uphill battle"" to convince anyone they should use a free standard instead of paying million of dollars in licensing fees per year.

That is, for most people, the number of brothers and sisters plus one (for the person we're talking about) is greater than the number of children that person will eventually have. Or at least it can be, even in a growing population.<p>Consider a family with four children. Alice, Bob, Charlie and Dave. Assume that Alice goes on to have four children of her own, and her brothers have none. So Alice has exactly as many children as brothers + sisters + 1. But 3/4 of the children in the original family have fewer children than siblings + 1.<p>It's a consequence of the counting being proportional to the size of the family. A family with 4 children gets counted four times, a family with 1 child gets counted only once. It's more complicated to show with friendships because the graph isn't directed, but it holds for the same reason. A social butterfly with lots of friends gets counted for each of his or her friends.

And speaking as someone who is greatly enamored of code generation, I am not a fan of restrictions on ""original"" programming languages.<p>My only question about your response here is your choice of comparison. The choice of text editor does not appear to me to parallel the imposition of an entire cross-platform compatibility layer like Flash.<p>I realize that in a certain sense it seems to be about dictating tools for self-expression, but where things like Flash compilers are concerned it also very much about proprietary companies attempting to control developers by owning the platform.<p>So... If I had to draw a lesson from Rails it would be that if we developers find ourselves having to choose which behaviour we want from a proprietary platform vendor or choosing which proprietary platform we are beholden to, maybe we should step back and ask ourselves whether we really want to be beholden at all.<p>Maybe what we really ought to be doing is sucking it up and developing for web standards where ""Worse is Better.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better</a>",1271110812

5012245,comment,5011477,5012009,3,0,biturd,,,"This is the best reddit mobile version I have seen that is not native.  If you aren't intending to have login and comments, then as it stands it is really very good.<p>Where are you drawing the line for features and completeness?<p>Assuming there is to be no login feature, the bugs I found that make it a bit of a showstopper for me are:<p>1. Finding sub-reddit's: you can only search, and the second you click on a result, it is auto-added.  I have added 'todayilearned' which was auto added.  When I select it, I am told there is ""Nothing To See Here"".  I suspect this is because the URL's are case sensitive and I didn't ""spell"" it correctly.  Some way to preview this would be nice.  And a way to just enter in /r/whatever-the-heck-i-want would be cool too.<p>2. There doesn't seem to be access to comments, which are arguably more valuable than the source links in most cases.<p>3. Adding to your home screen looks terrible as there is either no favicon.ico or the one that is there is not a well suited image.<p>4. URL bar and bottom buttons do not go away, even if launched from a home screen bookmark.<p>5. Search for a sub-reddit should probably have spelling auto-correct disabled.<p>6. After performing a search, there is no way to preview the sub-reddit's validity. It is auto-added immediately.  Perhaps take the user to that sub-redditand allow them to.preview it.  A floating bar at the top much like Apple's ""Open In App"" feature, or your own pop over for ""Are you sure you want to remove this sub-reddit"" could be implemented in this case.<p>7. The ""Preview"" overlay seems nicer if it were off by default, or preference controlled.  But keep the back button and other navigation ative.  Just remove the stuff that is obscuring the image.<p>8. There is no way to pinch and zoom, double-tap, etc., on an image.<p>9. kik logo and ""reddit head"" icons do nothing, and are not clear what they would do if they worked.<p>10. If possible to work reliably, unlike reddit's own mobile app, the ""next"" at the bottom could be an ""infiniscroll"" type feature instead.<p>11. The site Only seems to show pics, I can't find a single self post.  Is this a static list of test entries?  It is not matching the home page in any way I can understand.<p>12. The left and right ""<"" "">"" navigation buttons on images don't entirely make sense.  Are they moving through the posts, or are there more than one image posted to the post ( gallery )?  If it is the former, I would suggest removing them, as it takes you completely out of the context in which you were in.<p>Other than those small issues, this is very nice.  Exceptionally fast on an older 4s and equally responsive.  I would love to see something like this for Hacker News.",1357381615

I mean, if you look at Java, there is a very strict process which a JVM implementation must undergo in order to be called Java (and still there are a dozen of such implementations). It means it behaves predictably and have every one of the required APIs.
And most of development tools are written in Java.<p>On the other hand, with .Net we have Microsoft implementation on Windows - and we have everything else. .Net on Windows has a massive number of APIs (many of those system dependent), hatches into COM, can easily use native code and libraries.
Most .Net tools only work on Windows and are written as a mixture of native code, bytecode and COM.
And mono is a second class citisen forever. It will never have all those limitless APIs and will never have all the tooling.

I guess, I will consider BB for data-binding then.<p>I have tried most of the data-binding plugins in backbone.. They all fall short one way or the other. Stickit does not deal with collections, model-binder does but is a pain in the ass to use properly. Rivetjs seems better than the other two - but the scariest part of backbone plugins is that the community behind each is extremely small -hence its scary to consider them.",1357380430

JIT compilers for dynamic languages are quite a different thing because they generally only compile type-specialized fragments of code; such machine code has guards that fall back to the general-purpose interpreter if the expected preconditions do not hold.)",1357380349

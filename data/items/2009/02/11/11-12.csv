But you can get around this by having an email subscription to receive Xml, then deliver that to a public Google Groups set up for announce, and use Yahoo Pipes to parse the attached Xml and re-publish it as JSON... if anyone cares I've published a pipe for this here:\n<a href=""http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=f633ec8e5eabfe3c3c938676cb3761dd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=f633ec8e5eabfe3c3...</a>",1234353205

I was explaining ID.<p>I understand that religious creation-type people use ID as a shield from which to launch their anti-science attacks. I got that. What I'm trying to explain to you is that ID, as a way of knowing something, is a separate thing. In my opinion, people who mix up ID and creationism, <i>from either side</i>, look like morons. They're two different things.<p>It's like attacking people from the American South as being KKK rednecks. Yes, there is that part. But to mix it all up is to display a lack of understanding and a willingness <i>not to think</i>. Not thinking is bad. Better to understand ID and then attack creationists than just lump it all together. Ignorance is one thing, but stupidity -- the willful continuation of not learning -- is another. That's bad on any side of a discussion. When the science guys start acting stupid, you know the discussion is in trouble.",1234352893

If so, fancy running into you here! :) How have you been?<p>I'm working on my first Rails project at the moment and, as an exercise more than anything else, have been trying to keep things RESTful as much as possible. I am finding it quite difficult in some more complex situations to keep so strictly to the RESTful ideal and find that I must sometimes stray in deference to the way I want the UI to behave. Do you find that you need to stray out of the strict 7 actions when things like complex model relationships, user access control and AJAX come into the equation?<p>But yeah, I've also made my choice, for the foreseeable future, Ruby is for me, so Rails it is.",1234352176
476876,comment,476401,476465,0,0,dcx,,,"I think your numbers sound about right. If you assume each user subscribes to 15 sites, that's 30c per site per month after transaction costs, so a special interest blog with a thousand visitors nets $1,080 a year. Semi-pro mommybloggers and the like get $20,000. BoingBoing at a couple of million unique impressions, $2.2 million.<p>That seems lower than one might hope for as a content producer but maybe higher than an average consumer might want to pay as per month - about the right number? It makes sense that as the market approaches perfect competition (no barriers to entry, no information inequalities, no transport costs) it gets pretty hard to make abnormal returns - supply just ramps up until there is less per head.<p>This could be a nice channel for incentivising content that doesn't work well with an advertising model, for example RSS feeds. It'll be interesting to see whether they can market this well enough though.",1234352119

It was a <i>fluke</i> that many of the people posting in this thread discovered programming. They stumbled upon the editor, tapped out a couple lines, and something happened. Cool!<p>Python is certainly accessible to an experienced developer, but a 10-year-old's curiosity is superficial.

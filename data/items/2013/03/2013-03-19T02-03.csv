Because everything in Drupal is so abstracted, to do even the simplest thing, such as adding or modifying a form, as a developer you need to be across such a large extent of sub-systems and naming conventions that the learning curve on Drupal is simply way to high and totally unnecessary.<p>I say this because you shouldn't use Drupal for anything than building websites and if you're building websites then why not do yourself a favor and use Wordpress instead...",1363661707

The USD would be worthless if you could not at least use it to pay your taxes in the United States.<p>Your entire theory is predicated on the idea that currencies are valuable simply because they exist.  Supply is not sufficient to create value; demand must exist also, and your theory does not make it clear <i>why</i> anyone would demand any particular currency.  Why is CAN not used in the United States?  Why are Euros not used in Japan?  Why would the citizens of the United States almost all use USD, when so many other currencies exist?  Why don't people just use monopoly money?<p>Take the exchanges away, and you take away the demand for Bitcoin.  With the exception of a few cryptoanarchists, the demand for Bitcoin is really the demand for secure and anonymous electronic payments.

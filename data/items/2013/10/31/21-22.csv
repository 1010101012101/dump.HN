6650238,comment,6646936,6648801,1,0,Zancarius,,,"> For example, some may assume that sound based data transmission is implausible simply because of variation in speaker technology and quality and performance, but does that not assume some sort of analog transmission?<p>My personal beef with this theory is that you&#x27;re assuming a consumer-grade microphone can pick up such frequencies in a manner that would be capable of inducing enough of a signal on a microphone to produce a sufficiently specific data pattern to somehow exploit underlying firmware, drivers, or whatever. Considering there&#x27;s been speculation that an infected USB drive may have been shuttled between systems, it seems that the simplest explanation lends itself to the drive and not the microphone.<p>And yes, I have followed recent events with the NSA. I understand your suggestion that near-unlimited money can buy you almost anything, but there are many questions that this article doesn&#x27;t answer. While I think Mr. Ruiu has stumbled upon something novel, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as magical or mysterious as some here have been making it out to be.<p>Besides, wouldn&#x27;t it be relatively straightforward to demonstrate whether or not there is some capability of this malware to spread via a speaker-microphone route? Why not take a recording of known uninfected machines isolated in a room and then examine the sound signature later? The entirety of the experiment as related by Ars seems flawed (which I blame on the article, not on Mr. Ruiu, since he&#x27;s been spending a great deal of time working on this), but the possibility that this may actually be tied to exploiting a vendor identifier in an infected USB device is in some ways much more sinister. Some other threads discuss that possibility in detail.<p>It would be magnificent if there were such an attack vector, but I can&#x27;t shake the thought that it would have to be very specific to a certain subset of hardware or software.",1383256175

Have you lived anywhere else?<p>I work in downtown Seattle and my work takes me a-walking across huge portions of it, and my bus stop is right by 3rd and Pike. I&#x27;ve certainly never felt unsafe, and only occasionally have I been accosted by the homeless (or possibly crackheads) looking for money. There are some problem spots, but nothing terribly aggressive, certainly not by standards I&#x27;ve come to expect from my time in other major cities.<p>It&#x27;s much, MUCH better than what I saw/experienced while living in Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco or Kansas City. Seattle may have some issues with theft, but violent crime isn&#x27;t out of control. Play around with this [1] Wikipedia lin or this [2] comparison tool:<p>Seattle is 30th in total violent crime amongst cities with a population above 250,000. Not great, but not bad. For Murder Seattle is 67 out of 75. That&#x27;s, comparatively, very good.<p>As for your specific points, I agree with them without regarding them as contributing as much negative impact as you state. You make it sound like Seattle is some pedestrian ghost town where you&#x27;re taking your life into your own hands by taking a wrong turn. Like any city, some neighborhoods are better than others for leisure activities, and there are some worth avoiding into the night. But it&#x27;s no worse than most other cities, and often considerably better.<p>--<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cities_by_crime_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cities_by_crime_r...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.areaconnect.com/crime/compare.htm?c1=Seattle&s1=WA&c2=kansas+city&s2=MO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.areaconnect.com/crime/compare.htm?c1=Seattle&s1=W...</a>",1383255559

And I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s applicable in this case. First, a modem is designed specifically for such a use case--second, we&#x27;re talking about an exploit that would (in theory) somehow make use of a microphone to spread itself to a target host.<p>You would have to assume that there&#x27;s some flaw in either the audio driver for the microphone, firmware, or whatever that can be exploited by sending some combination of sounds to it. While that&#x27;s <i>possible</i>, it seems unlikely that would be the case and much more likely that the culprit is an infected USB device of some sort, which has been discussed at length in other threads here (and would take far less work). For the variable quality of consumer microphones in a laptop or other such device to pick up a signal in such a manner as to exploit firmware/driver software at range makes this theory questionable IMO.<p>My personal hunch isn&#x27;t that Mr. Ruiu is wrong.

To me, the happiest people have always been in a supportive group, generally focused around central beliefs. Whether it&#x27;s groups of coders hanging out after work or weeaboos watching new animes together, a community seems a core component of happiness, and I view more people having a deep, personal happiness as more important than crushing faith. Then again, I don&#x27;t see religion as a threat to the human race, so if you can prove (or argue compellingly) for your first point, I may have to reconsider this one.<p>3) Everybody always says that The Crusades were entirely motivated by religion. That is foolish; I would argue that it was another war fought for the same reason that every war has ever been fought: for power. But in this war, one of the parties was behind a flag of religious righteousness. I will again point to the fact that a bunch of people have killed, many, many more people in cases entirely devoid of religious ideologies. How many people died during the crusades? Was it less than 40 million? I did a little bit of googling, and it seems to be way less than 40 million, so it still pales in comparison to Mao or Genghis Kahn.<p>4) I didn&#x27;t disable comments. I don&#x27;t know if Medium has comments, but this is the correct forum for airing comments; that&#x27;s why I posted it to hn in the first place.

6650077,comment,6648037,6648392,14,0,rayiner,,,"> Why is that when the government says &quot;But, but computer!&quot; judges abandon common sense and case law.<p>It&#x27;s exactly the opposite. It&#x27;s technologists that say &quot;but, but computer!&quot; and demand special treatment for computers are involved.[1] Judges generally treat computers in terms of real-world analogies to concrete things, and these analogies often clash with idealistic notions held by technologists.<p>This case is actually an excellent example of that phenomenon. I&#x27;ve heard people say that their laptop/phone/etc is an &quot;extension of their mind&quot; or something to that effect. Because the 5th amendment only applies to testimonial incrimination (because of the use of the word &quot;witness&quot; in the text of the 5th), you need that nexus to the mind in order to justify concluding that forcing someone to give up an encryption key is equivalent to forcing them to testify against themselves.<p>The more obvious (to me, anyway) analogy is that a laptop/phone is like a backpack or briefcase. I keep documents, photos, notes, etc, in my laptop just as I would keep them in a briefcase. Well, under the case law it is not prohibited under the 5th amendment to force someone to unlock a briefcase! That act has no nexus with a person&#x27;s internal thoughts and is thus not testimonial.<p>[1] Other examples include various CFAA-related things. Nobody would defend just walking into peoples&#x27; houses and saying &quot;hey, your locks suck!&quot; but defend analogous behavior with regard to computer security all the time. You also see it in the e-mail context. E.g. most people who complain about the government possibly subpoenaing e-mails they store on Google&#x27;s servers would not see the problem with the government subpoenaing Enron&#x27;s records they stored at their accounts&#x27; premises. Technologists generally want to ignore the obvious physical analogies in favor of ones based on how they perceive the electronic world (i.e. it&#x27;s &quot;my personal documents&quot; even though it&#x27;s stored on a cloud and dozens of engineers and sysadmins have access to them).",1383254866

If the only message that gets across is &quot;new thorium reactors are safer than old reactors,&quot; it&#x27;s still a win for everyone involved because this message is a subset of the truth (new reactor designs are safer than old designs in general).<p>I don&#x27;t think the public properly appreciates the extent to which nuclear safety mechanisms have improved dramatically over time, not least because a design&#x27;s safety profile is largely &quot;frozen in&quot; when it is built, so we occasionally see a half-century old &quot;bug&quot; rear its head (Fukushima). The public sees it as evidence against the safety claims of future nuclear plants, even though it is not (quite the opposite: building newer, safer plants lets us retire the old, dangerous ones). Rebranding might get them to take another look.<p>Actually, I think including as much detail as the parent post did might be a net negative because it muddies the core message.

Persistent (though not apocalyptic levels of) gun crime.<p>Downtown Seattle can be a bit rough. I wouldn&#x27;t lay it squarely at the feet of the mayor though - a lot of it traces back to city planning gone disastrously wrong.<p>Just a few off the top of my head:<p>- the southern end of downtown is <i>strictly</i> commercial. Little to no mixed zoning here, meaning that as soon as 5pm rolls by the entire area is a ghost town. If you&#x27;re there past 6-7pm you will see that the homeless and addicts move in to fill the void. There is no residential or leisure traffic to balance this out. This is US-style single-purpose urban zoning run amok. <i>Vast</i> portions of the urban core is entirely idle after work hours.<p>- downtown Seattle isn&#x27;t a cultural or entertainment core, unlike the downtowns of most cities. The actual food scene, nightlife scene, music scene, etc, are in surrounding neighborhoods like Capitol Hill, Ballard, Fremont, etc. This contributes to low foot traffic after work hours, which contributes to higher crime and simultaneously a magnified perception of danger.<p>- poor urban planning decisions meant an explosion in large-scale development without sufficient requirement for retail frontage. <i>Lots</i> of buildings that take up the entire block with little to no ground-floor retail, making it a pedestrian dead zone and contributing to the feeling of walking down a shady alley no matter where you are. See: much of Belltown, where the declared intent was to produce a walkable neighborhood full of restaurants and nightlife - except few residential buildings wanted to play host to them. This has resulted in little pockets of activity with vast stretches of nothingness in between them.",1383253613

Myth is metaphor -- so they don&#x27;t understand it. Theists read the bible and say this is literally true. Atheists read it and say this is false, it&#x27;s a lie. Agnostics read it and say, not sure.. But the transcendent perspective is to see that &quot;God&quot; is a Myth, not a lie. God is a myth that represents the unknowable ground of your being, and the religions are a mythology designed to aid your ego on it&#x27;s journey of self discovery and guide society. Myth is a mirror for the ego with a schedule on it - it shows you where you are. The literalists will be hard pressed to have the spiritual salvation they seek without knowing what a metaphor is -- they will be stuck looking outside themselves when the God they seek is within -- the mythologies are designed to help find it.",1383253601

Proper presence info that just works. The tie-ins with Outlook/OWA/Exchange for voicemail and such is also really slick.<p>Slick and easy call management (forward, sent to group, VM), easy IM, group IM, easy escalation to screen sharing or voice and video conferencing. All of this is secured by your own TLS certs. IM history goes into Outlook, one simple place for all forms of communication from SMS to missed calls, voicemails, IMs and emails.<p>Edit: Oh, also, easy federated IM. We can now have customers federate via O365 and IM us directly. There are blocking tools in place to prevent abuse. But it&#x27;s far better than having to list a Skype/GTalk/AIM/MSN ID.<p>I&#x27;d love to know of a non-enterprise competitor in this space (like why go to Cisco over MS?). Pretty much everything I&#x27;ve seen is not remotely on the same level. For example, they&#x27;ll plaster a &quot;Dial&quot; toolbar by rendering on top of some other part of the Outlook UI, and then call that integrated dialing. Or you&#x27;ll have to use a web UI somewhere and login to a phone just to change your call forwarding settings.<p>No particular pieces are terribly hard by themselves, but it&#x27;s a massive amount of work to get it all really polished up and have it just work so wonderfully. Without the centerpoint of Exchange/Outlook, I think a Lync competitor has a pretty big uphill battle.",1383253486

At-will is not a feature of overtime exemption.<p>No matter what kind of job you have, hourly or salaried, you can be severed at any time for no reason virtually anywhere in the US. At-will employment increases labor mobility and, very notably, makes entrepreneurship less risky by mitigating the problem of every termination being grounds for a lawsuit. At-will has social costs in other sectors where negotiating leverage isn&#x27;t as balanced between buyers and sellers, but it is probably a significant net benefit for the tech sector.<p>The swap that is supposed to take place for salary-basis employees is that employees exchange their right to overtime pay for an assurance of full salary payment regardless of hours worked. If you dock an exempt worker&#x27;s pay for leaving early or coming in late, they revert to overtime-eligible status; that&#x27;s something that came up at a company I once worked for.

This means that no other store like Amazon will be able to create a second store based on Android with a fresh environment out of the box. Google says is due to modularity I say due to market strategy. As a clear example (apart from the clear explanation of the article, great article BTW) a feature released today on KiKat 4.4 is that WebView is based on Chromium, this means the sole purpose of only Google using WebView. If I where Amazon I would be reconsidering having to develop all again for future releases or today make a fair deal with Google.<p>However this is not bad news at all for startups like myself because of two things.<p>1) Google will spend about a year or two on refactoring Android to fully cope with PLAY dependence allowing some spare &quot;time&quot; for third party ideas on features that can advance outside Google internal teams.<p>2) Third party developer a are now in equal position to compete with Google applications to win terrain into Android future tiny out of the box.

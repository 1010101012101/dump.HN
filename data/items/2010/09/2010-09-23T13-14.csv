The math is simple and I have a mountain of data that supports the reality that .NET developers get paid significantly more (20-30%) on average than any of the hot whiz-bang alternatives (Ruby, PHP, Java, etc). The average mid-level .NET developer in a dev-friendly town (san fran, boston, new york, etc) is making $80-90k, Senior $90-110k, Architects $110-130k, Director/Managers $130-160k. Those are averages that don't include bonuses. There are of course exceptions (finance industry add 20% to the above figures, start-ups subtract 10%, etc).<p>Never underestimate the position that money holds in ones relationship with their chosen path in life.<p>I think the authors argument is valid and is the reason why most of the developers that leave the .NET world do, but my observations indicate that most .NET/MS developers are lifers.<p>On a side note, I actively practice development in.NET, PHP, Java, and a few other languages at my 9 to 5.

I mean, when you appear to be ostentatiously wealthy, service people assume that you are rich and try to charge accordingly.  Early in my career, I drove a BMW.  I mean, it was used, maybe 7 years old when I got it, but it was still a pretty nice car.  (I was raised on Skinner and Montessori.  this was my rebellion.)  I mean, at the time, it was somewhat cheaper than a new honda civic, but unless you were a BMW enthusiast, you wouldn't have been able to tell it wasn't newer.<p>But it's funny how differently service people treat you when you drive up in a bmw vs. the beat-up  15 year old nissan I got after the motorcycle that I got after the bmw.  It's not like the cars aren't comparable;  I mean, the bmw would go around corners faster, and would blow the doors off anything ""normal""  in the 60-120Mph range, but as for 0-60 straight line performance?  the maxima is faster.<p>I mean, I liked the BMW, it was a nice car... but it didn't help at all when I was trying to negotiate.",1285250140

People spend a lot of time and energy trying to ensure they won't get ripped off, and a minority that is still too large spends a lot of time and energy actually trying to rip other people off.  As a consultant, I've sometimes found it easier to deal with customers who I have never met in the US, rather than Italian firms (although at the moment I'm working remotely with some pretty good people in Milan, which is a nice change).  Ultimately, all this is energy lost to actual productivity.<p>And if you try and go through the justice system, it can be expensive and slower than in other places (although not always - my wife recovered some unpaid wages pretty quickly and easily several years back).<p>So yeah, that's a big issue with doing business in Italy, and not an easy one to fix.<p>> if you want to buy an internet domain, you still have to send a fax.<p>I think they finally changed that, or so I heard.

If you want to work in the web industry the only two ways to make moneys are services (web agencies, consulting, etc.) or ads.

So employers either give the job to someone they know, or contract from a large firm with the expectation that the firm deals with whatever might come up frequently enough that it reduces their risk. The exceptions to this tend to be when the project is doomed, and the employer is just desperate to get anyone to work on it, which you don't want.<p>So looking at those two cases, your best plans of action are to either subcontract for a larger firm in order to get fed more jobs, or do more networking to lead to those jobs.  Sometimes the networking is in the form of doing odd jobs and low value jobs until something larger comes up, and sometimes just a matter of letting friends know you are looking for work.<p>It would be nice if there were an easier method to go about it, but the bottom line is that $100/hr is a fairly valuable wage, and you need to earn trust before someone is going to fork it over.",1285249302

        (regex [d d d d :as :year] \- [d d :as :month] \- [d d :as :day])))

The captures are stored %+ variable (ie. $+{year}, $+{month} & $+{date}).<p>The /x (on the end of the regex object <i>qr</i>) allows whitespace & newlines in the regex composition making it much easier to read.  Anyone doing a longer than a few chars regex should always have this :)<p>And composing your regex in bites is definitely a good idea:<p><pre><code>    sub datestamp_re  {

If nothing else, they ought to explore the major ports from the Java world (e.g. NHibernate, Spring.NET, etc.).  .NET developers are effectively slaves to their tools; don't get me wrong, Visual Studio is an impressive IDE and development environment but it over-shields.  It's shocking how out of their comfort zone most are with anything that does not start with the letter 'n' or end with the word 'dotnet'.<p>I agree with the points made about economics and marketability, but, at least for me, if you want to stand out from the .NET crowd (in turn making yourself more marketable), learn something, anything, as long as it's not a first class citizen on Microsoft's stack. Become familiar with a language other than C# or (gasp!) VB.NET.  Try IronPython or F#; you're still on the CLR! Learn to appreciate and leverage patterns.

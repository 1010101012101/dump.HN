It's a persistent and seductive intuition that this is the case, but as Asimov points out it is only a matter of convention. Some geniuses can be very bad at dealing with mathematical abstractions and very good at performing in a specialized domain. Gifted athletes come to mind.<p>Wittgenstein puts it this way:<p><i>I can play with the chessmen according to certain rules. But I can also invent a game in which I play with the rules themselves.

2884826,comment,2871385,2871385,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I disagree with the logical premise of this article, at least for our specific case (social networking app sending notifications about activity). We most certainly <i>don't</i> want replies. The sender of the emails is not us, our company, but the application itself. When a calendar app on your smartphone reminds you of a meeting, there's no ""Reply"" button because having one simply doesn't make sense.<p>The fact that email is a system where it's implied that anything is replyable is unfortunate. Email is currently the best option for sending out notifications on the Internet, since most people don't know about feeds or how to use them. If there were a better, equally established technology for one-way notifications, we would use it. (We use SMS messaging, too, but only when it makes sense, since it's pretty invasive.)<p>Anyway, we did try to kill the no-reply behaviour at one point. Sounded good on paper, but it was impossible to execute in practice. Some issues, off the top of my head:<p>* We got a ton of vacation autoresponses, in all sorts of languages and all sorts of phrasings. It would be too time-consuming to set up rules to deal with all of the variations.<p>* We got an onslaught of replies accusing us of spamming them. These were users of our site, remember; a lot of sign up to an app and then promptly forget that they were now members. They never read the actual email, which has a very visible footer explaining how to disable notifications.<p>* A lot of confused users replied to the emails, either to thank us for the notification (not useful), or intended as a reply to a specific user, such as in the case of ""new comment"" notifications.<p>Sure, in some cases (like comment follow-ups) we could automatically process the rely. However, I'm really skeptical about our ability to handle email formatting well, though. Things like quoting, HTML, ""On June 12th, John Doe wrote:"" headers (which often are not in English) and signatures must be stripped, and I could not find an existing library that would do this reliably.<p>Maybe if you are Facebook or Google you can spend the necessary manpower to deal with the technical challenges, but we can't; our company is small enough that we can't even afford the resources necessary to screen replies manually.",1313364651
2884825,comment,2855559,2856078,1,0,protomyth,,,"Nope, I was very serious.  The narrative of a company using its cash cow to finance a product, given away for free, that directly attacks the cash cow of another company was why the DoJ went after Microsoft for Netscape.  A smart Microsoft lawyer could do a fairly easy narrative that in the case Google (cash cow: Ads) is going after Microsoft (cash cow: OS) via a free product (Android).  Throw in patent violations and it is a pretty good narrative for a not-so-scary-anymore Microsoft.<p>You and others (given the down votes) may not agree with the narrative and don't want to hear it, but it is a probable argument that can be used to go after Google and stay any effort to allow them free use of other companies patents.  The original DoJ's case against Microsoft attacking IE was rather out there given Microsoft's other behavior (i.e. no matter what OS you buy Microsoft still gets its fee).<p>// I think this is my last comment on any Google story.

However, when the JPEG is converted to a texture it is completely decompressed.  Texture compression formats aren't as good at compression as JPEG, but they are specially designed so that they never need to be decompressed; they remain compressed in graphics memory and the GPU decodes them on the fly as they are sampled.  Not only does this save graphics memory, it also saves memory bandwidth, which actually makes rendering faster.<p>Given this, it makes sense to store your textures as JPEG and convert them to compressed textures at load time.  That way you get the excellent compression ratio of JPEG for the download and the speed boost of compressed textures for rendering. For example, id Tech 5 (RAGE) does this for their megatextures (except they use JPEG XR instead of JPEG).",1313363760

I think that the big difference between the present and the past is that the monetary value of our attention has increased dramatically, and companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars just to get us to look at them. It takes a lot of discipline to keep yourself from looking at a trillion-dollar lightshow.<p>I just don't buy the premise of this article, which is that because of all of these distractions, people are no longer grappling with big ideas.

He mentions Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould as examples of people who would be superstar public intellectuals in an earlier time period, but I think that they are <i>now</i>. This is pure conjecture on my part, but I think that the percentage of the population that knows who Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould are is higher than the percentage of the population that knew who Marshall McLuhan and John Maynard Keynes were when they were active. In fact, I would venture a guess that Marshall McLuhan and John Maynard Keynes are <i>also</i> more well-known now than they were in their day. It's a lot easier for big ideas to reach the general public through the Internet than through old media and local word-of-mouth. Most of these people will never penetrate beyond the surface level, but at least they're aware that these big discussions exist.

If you want to become a Goldman (or similar caliber) I-banker or work at a top flight consulting firm, a top MBA is the way to go.<p>Yes there are other ways to get these jobs, but the recruiting processes for these firms are highly targeted and organized when it comes to hiring people from prestigious MBA programs.  It truly is the path of least resistance.  And if you truly set your mind to becoming employed by one of these firms, you can likely attain it once admitted to a top business school.  We can argue the merits of joining one of these companies, but that's another argument entirely.<p>2. If you go work at said type of firm, your employment options thereafter are wide open.<p>I don't have statistics to back this up, but having worked in corporate for a healthy portion of my career, Goldman and McKinsey candidates were often ear-marked for positions that they applied for.<p>3. The MBA is good for ""career changers"".<p>Assuming you want to go the corporate route, an MBA is a very versatile degree.  If from a top school, it practically forgives whatever you were doing before the MBA and enables you to transition into something largely unrelated if that's your wish.  You need to do a whole lot of networking and build your story to make this happen, but with two years to do so, there's plenty of time.  And the fact of the matter is that, regardless of how you regard MBAS, plenty of highly regarded corporates (including Google!) formally plug into the recruiting process at top schools.<p>EDIT: I understand many of the arguments above may not apply to the HN community as it skews entrepreneurial and perhaps academic, but I believe they have merit nonetheless.",1313362976

If someone sits in McDonald's and repeatedly takes all the napkins from the dispenser, he will be asked to leave, and if he persists he may have to deal with the police; the economic cost to McDonald's is minimal, and the inconvenience to other customers minor and localised. Ditto someone choosing to sit in the restroom all day, someone coming in and siphoning all the soda out of a machine, etc. For each of these examples, there is minimal economic cost or inconvenience to other patrons or the business involved, but a <i>lot</i> of inconvenience for the defector -- he has to physically gather up the items, sit in the restroom, etc, for minimal benefit to himself (what, he's going to eBay a million napkins?)<p>Compared with this, the Jonathan's Card scam provided an effective income of $130 per hour, at a cost of sitting in a comfy couch at Starbucks drinking coffee.

3475256,comment,3473800,3473800,5,0,steve8918,,,"I've found that I will have times of really, really productive programming, usually around 5-6 hrs a day for 3-5 days.  I'm not one of those guys that can claim to program 18 hrs a day for weeks on end, but I'm pretty happy with the quality and amount that I can program.  However, historically, my biggest weakness is that once I finish a milestone in any particular project, I get too pleased with myself, I admire what I have built, and then take the next 2 days kind of milling around.  \nI recently decided to take 1 yr off to pursue my own side-projects, so this is the one thing I'm trying to change about myself.<p>I'm not one to advocate Performance enhancing drugs, but I've discovered that taking a 5 Hr energy around 11 am really helps me concentrate the rest of the day, especially when I'm learning new things.<p>Every programmer has their own style, but the one thing I disagree with the OP is programming in a complete vacuum.  I agree that programming by yourself really helps in terms of getting rid of your distractions.<p>But the one thing I miss is sitting around and talking about problems with other programmers.  I've found throughout my career that when I stuck on a particular bug or issue, as soon as I try to talk it out with another programmer, the answer comes pretty quickly.  The physical act of trying to explain the situation seems to force you to take a different pathway in your brain that gives you another perspective that you might have been otherwise stuck on if you just say there thinking about it.",1326815966

The onus is on the author here to show why this situation is different from the normal one, different enough to justify changing the rules. As for your specific questions...<p>1. Speech writing is considered a useful art. Creative works of authorship generally are. If you want to argue that point <i>in general</i>, fine... but let's put it into a general context instead of just focusing on this one speech.<p>2. Sony is of course not the author. But MLK is, and he never put this speech in the public domain. He certainly could have if he wanted to, but he didn't. His rights passed to his estate. His estate isn't the author either, but it has the right to sell or license. None of this is controversial or unexpected.<p>3. I tend to agree with you here.",1326815877

Don Norman says:<p>""Actually, I would like to see web designers disappear and become designers. Web design was this specialized activity because we had these screens, we had this fixed format and we had to figure out how to display it so that it was understandable, usable, so you could find the stuff, so you could navigate the complex architecture of the website. On top of that, you had amazingly little control over what it really looked like on the screen.<p>Well, that lack of control is going to expand with the modern smartphones. They come now in all sizes and shapes. They come very small, to larger and larger and larger, and when they become too large we dont call them a phone anymore, we call it a pad. But its really the same device, just getting larger and larger and larger. And pretty soon theyre on the wall, theyre big TV sets, or displayed, or projected. And so the designers job is much more complex and very, very necessary. But its not web design, its information design, communication design.""",1326815795

Help.",,"tl;dr: killer idea, if I take money, wife undeservedly will take 50%, so, I'm not sure if I want to launch the killer idea.<p>For the last few years I've been involved in a loveless marriage. On the surface, everything looks fine to my family, but, I hear the phone calls all the time:<p><pre><code>  ""If I had the money, I'd leave him.""\n</code></pre>\nI don't believe she's cheated on me and when approached, she denies it, says things are fine, I know they aren't. I'm a meal ticket, plain and simple. Years ago when I wanted to branch out and diversify into a few non-Internet related things, I was told:<p><pre><code>  ""Whatever you do, you're on your own.""\n</code></pre>\nWithout the support of a significant other in a relationship and the constant reminders that the household needs cash, I'm unable to work on some projects that I know could be successful as she's not willing to endure lean times.<p>I'm in a lean time now. A client broke a contract, I'm in a rough financial situation that will resolve itself shortly when I can renegotiate one of my supplier contracts at its renewal date.<p>I'm an idea man that can execute. I've launched a number of projects that have all been somewhat profitable - at least to the point of making sure there was food on the table. Never a home-run type project that brought in tons of extra cash, but, we've lived pretty well - or so I thought.<p>I've worked hard. I haven't had a vacation or day off in years. I feel that my wife must have been George Michael's ex-wife and was the inspiration for 'Everything She Wants'. My life is wake up, code, sleep. She works at a salon, earning 'her money'. She drives a considerable distance, I pay for gas, tolls, etc and as near as I can tell, she is paid on commission only. But it is social time among the people as there isn't much business. When she's done with her day, she goes to play cards with her other friends. We have dinner together perhaps two nights per week.<p>I've had an idea for an Android and IPhone app that I've sat on for almost two years. It would change the world. I've got clients that could get it to the right people and the timing is probably getting close. Technology tomorrow will probably solve many of the problems the concept has now.<p>I've got another idea that I believe will take off that I've been mulling over since the late 80s. Technology has become ubiquitous enough and society has probably come far enough to accept the concept. Since the 80s, I've seen exactly two implementations of the concept - one using nametags back in the early 90s, the other just recently doing it with stored value RF cards.<p>I've got dozens of others, all in various states - only needing time and effort to complete.<p>But, none of those are the idea that I've spent the last few weeks refining and tweaking. I have a small group of people I bounce ideas off of and usually the response I get is blahse. This idea has a client calling me all hours of the day and night asking if I've thought of this or that, can it do this, will it do that. Another client is asking for capabilities that I've thought about and documented.<p><pre><code>  ""This idea is going to change social photo sharing.""\n</code></pre>\nI have three scenarios in mind:<p>1) launches, doesn't get much uptake but becomes somewhat popular.\n2) launches, gets wildly popular, becomes a talent acquisition.\n3) launches, gets wildly popular, is bought by 'BigCo' and incorporated into their product.<p>Two of those three have an outcome that scares me. I've always said, if I won the lottery I would give my wife half immediately. If she stayed with me, I would know she loved me. If given that choice today, she will take her 50% and leave.<p>That's my money. She hasn't contributed a dime to the household in almost fourteen years. She pays the bills from my payroll check every month, but, our fridge sees nothing but Coke cans. Our two shared meals a week are takeout from the Chinese restaurant or Subway - and I really hate Chinese food.<p>I have a few investors practically harassing me to take their money on several ideas I've pitched in casual conversation. I've always avoided their direct questions or asked them, ""Why me? Why my idea?"" and that is usually enough to styme them until the next time we meet.<p>I have a $25m idea by conservative estimates. Two clients claim the idea should get a much higher valuation based on so many things that have gotten funding that don't have a business model figured out. I can't afford to build something without knowing there is cash coming in quickly, so my ideas are usually fairly safe.<p>The dilemma:<p>I have a prototype. I have the Android app almost working. I have most of the issues on the frontend figured out. I have the IPhone app working in the emulator. I have a public beta scheduled for later this month with a few people and I've been told to make sure I'm ready for 'a heap of people' to start using it. I know the few investors are going to become quite aggressive.<p>I'm ambivalent about the marriage. I married a rich girl, I came from a poor family. I didn't listen to my family, she didn't listen to hers. Her family cut her off from her trust fund when she married me - it isn't enough for her to live on. I've never wanted her money and I've worked my butt off for everything I've had. I still see her rich girl tendencies - intentionally breaking things so she can have a reason to buy a replacement, etc. But, I know the minute I get a large cash infusion and start growing this thing, it'll be noticed and the time will be right. I suspect the company would get significant investments in 6-8 months which would allow her to cash out with her golden parachute.<p>Yes, I could take steps to protect the money, move it offshore, keep it in the business, hide and shuffle it, but, that isn't ethical. Even though she's going to be out for everything she wants, I know the number is 50%. The house, the cars, the boat, the furniture, etc are all meaningless to me.<p>I'm almost not willing to launch this because I know 50% of whatever I make off this project is going to get thrown away to someone that doesn't deserve it.<p>Help.",1326815540

In the course of a year I spun through about one idea per month.<p>I got remarkably good at (in)validating my ideas. (Hint: write down who you think your target market is and then pick up the phone. Have a conversation. Ask if they would pay $X dollars for your product where X is something that makes you cringe because you think it's too much. If it's worth pursuing they won't hesitate to say yes. Then tell them if they give you $X right now you'll start building it for them -- if they ask where to send the check you're golden, otherwise you need to rethink your assumptions.

It wasn't because I was afraid they wouldn't pay, (they would have). It was because I was afraid of supporting the project.

I'd be working on the ext4 file system whether Google paid me or not.   It's something that I'm passionate about it.   Heck, even if I won a lottery and had a $20 million dollar windfall, I'd probably still be working there, because it's incredibly fun working with lots of smart people, and I'm at a place where I can definitely and directly see how my work is making a difference.<p>So people who talk about it as being a velvet cage have gotten it all wrong.   It's a cage, if you want to call it a cage, that I've chosen of my own free will; it's how I've wanted to spend my time even before I joined Google.   Google has simply removed obstacles from allowing me to work on my passion as much as I like; in general, I think it's fair to say that Google wants to find people who are smart and passionate at what they do; those for whom their work is a joy, and not just something they do so they can put bread on the table.<p>As far as promotions are concerned, the criteria at least for software engineers is pretty simple: it's a matter of demonstrating that you are already working at your new level, in terms of technical expertise, scope of your work, and impact to the company.

Regulatory bodies like the FDA have every incentive to stop the release of new medicine: the government employees involved suffer far more from bad press for an approved medical technology than they do from the largely unexamined consequences of heavy regulation. These consequences go far beyond the obvious and announced disapproval of specific medical technologies: the far greater cost lies in all the research, innovation and development that was never undertaken because regulatory burdens ensure there would be no profit for the developer. Personal gain for the regulator is thus to destroy the gains of people they will never meet, the exact opposite of what occurs in an open marketplace.""<p><a href=""http://www.fdareview.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fdareview.org</a><p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2011/11/an-unusually-clear-example-of-the-cost-of-the-fda.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2011/11/an-unusually-clea...</a><p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2011/12/when-you-make-medical-progress-illegal-what-results-is-a-black-market-in-medical-progress.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2011/12/when-you-make-med...</a><p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2010/03/the-roadblock-that-is-the-fda.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2010/03/the-roadblock-tha...</a><p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2008/05/envisaging-a-world-without-the-fda.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2008/05/envisaging-a-worl...</a><p><a href=""https://www.opencures.org/content/open-cures-speed-clinical-development-longevity-science"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.opencures.org/content/open-cures-speed-clinical-...</a>",1326813184

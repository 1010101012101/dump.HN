5994325,comment,5993959,5994257,30,0,jgrahamc,,,"In the RSA cryptosystem there are three really important numbers N (which is the product of two large primes N=pq), e (the public exponent) and d (the private exponent).  The public key in an RSA scheme is <N,e> and the private key is <N,d>. The only bit of the private key that&#x27;s private is d.<p>A large part of the security of RSA relies on you not being able to figure out d from N and e. Now the key element of RSA is that<p><pre><code>   de = 1 mod (p-1)(q-1)
</code></pre>
So what happens if e = 1? You get<p><pre><code>   d = 1 mod (p-1)(q-1)
</code></pre>
So you know the value of d. So you know the private key. So you can decrypt everything.<p>But you don&#x27;t actually need to do that because what is RSA encryption? It&#x27;s computing the following (c is the cipher text you&#x27;ll transmit, m is the message being sent which is to be encrypted with the public key <N,e>)<p><pre><code>  c = m^e (mod N)
</code></pre>
If e = 1 then that&#x27;s<p><pre><code>  c = m (mod N)
</code></pre>
but, oh wait, m is always < N so m (mod N) is just m, i.e.<p><pre><code>  c = m
</code></pre>
i.e. the encryption does nothing.<p>Looking on the bright side an exponent of 1 does make RSA quite fast :-)<p>PS Test code for those interested showing the same N with exponents 1 and 65537 and effect of encryption: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/jgrahamc/5933984"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jgrahamc/5933984</a>",1373021511

    become a US company. All our datacentres are in the UK, and expansion plans are
    for the EU only.

    We believe strongly in data protection and obey all the relevant laws. I agree
    that ISPs really *should* be considered &quot;mere conduits&quot; but unfortunately there
    is legal precedent that means we can be held responsible for defamatory content
    if we&#x27;re notified and do nothing about it.

    Usually, solicitors for the allegedly defamed contacts both us and our customer.
    If our customer is unresponsive or uncooperative and the alleged defamation
    continues, then we get held responsible.

    So our AUP considers defamation abuse to enable us to take action to protect
    ourselves if we have to. The only other option available to us would be to have
    customers indemnify us against any legal action (most likely in the form of
    a large deposit :).

    But we&#x27;re not interested in suspending accounts or servers any time a
    solicitor writes to us. If you deal with the reports in a timely fashion (usually
    within 48 hours) then you shouldn&#x27;t expect any problems.

    And for what it&#x27;s worth, we&#x27;ve never actually had to suspend anyone for this
    (though we&#x27;ve come close enough to feel the need to put it in our AUP).

The comment shortly stating &quot;not in Germany&quot; however is partly right. The Data Retention Directive applies to Germany, too.<p>To explain this further, one needs to know how EU legislation works. As it is a supranational state conglomerate, a lot of its legislation is not immediately binding. This is how &quot;EU Directives&quot; differ from &quot;EU Regulations&quot;. The latter are directly applicable, binding law. But the Directives need to be realized by EU member states doing legislation of their own. They have some degree of freedom for doing so.<p>Arguably, Germany didn&#x27;t have the freedom to not push forward with its own realization of that Directive. However, it is disputed that the Data Retention Directive is actually conforming to EU law - and that was not checked in court yet to its full extent. So the matter is highly political in its nature. The EU Commission, which watches over the implementation of the Directives, is currently in a legal battle over sanctions regarding the non-implementation.<p>Germany is not alone here, however.

This type of &quot;scrollmation&quot; feels incredibly clunky to me. I have never got to the end of one.<p>If you need that much animation on a page to tell your story, isn&#x27;t it a good sign that video might be more fit for purpose? Video was designed for storytelling, it will work on most devices, and it has well-established UI and conventions, such as a play button and progress bar.<p>If you&#x27;re going to provide a play button in your scrollmation to automatically advance the action anyway, you&#x27;ve already recognised how irritating it is to manually page through an animated story by scrolling or swiping. So why then go to the trouble of creating a scroll-based animation that repurposes a 20+ year old convention and attempts to reinvent a tiny proportion of what video has to offer?<p>Is it just for the novelty value?<p>Is it because it makes you feel smarter?<p>How is it better for users trying to understand your story?<p>I&#x27;d love to hear from anyone who&#x27;s considered both video and scrollmation and chosen the latter.",1373019384

Personally I think the EU should haul us over the coals, not just a fine, but actual sanctions. However, I&#x27;m not sure the EU really has the balls to do that. And frankly I don&#x27;t want to give that nasty UKIP bunch any fuel what so ever.<p>An issue I see is that actually the UK is more in to this that even the US. Might not have the depth and scope, but certainly the intention, with out even the fig leaf of a constitution. American citizens have some rights to work with, we dont. When you get down to it, we are facilitating the US spying on the EU, as we seem to be some sort of gateway hub between the EU and the US, and we, for some reason I do not understand, favor the US over Europe. While much of the embarrassment is on the US, the Snowden lark puts the UK in a very exposed piggy in the middle position where we might get forced to pick sides. The US can take care of its self, but the UK could be left deservedly politically stranded.<p>On the other hand, the EU has a lot of its own problems and Im not sure it has the motivation to pick a proper fight with the UK. All we&#x27;ll probably get is some posturing to appease who ever is complaining, and normal BS will resume.<p>I have to say, given all that, it rather amuses me that a few years ago Obama was telling the UK it should look more to Europe than the US. Heh, I suppose now we know why: We are the US agent in Europe.<p>I have to wonder if long term the Snowden leaks are more damaging to the UK than the US. People will still deal with the US because of its economic and military power, neither of which apply to the UK.",1373019202

The past it seems is no longer something that we are supposed to learn from, and the notion that there may be parallels between the past and the present is now termed 'offensive'.<p>In a lesser forum, you would likely be dismissed out of hand for mentioning the Stasi, even though your reasons for mentioning it are very sound.

4927991,comment,4925900,4927698,1,0,gruturo,,,"Different effect. A rock is actually following a curved trajectory through ordinary space. Light always goes straight - but in these extreme circumstances space itself is curved. You can easily verify this by looking at said curving rock: the fact that you can see it without distortions (or at all) implies that its region of space has insignificant curvature and the light from the event is reaching your eyes is an easy indication of it.<p>Ordinary masses bend space nowhere nearly enough. The Sun bends space just <i>barely</i> enough for the effect to be observable in a solar eclipse (it was used as a verification of Einstein's theories) by causing stars behind it to appear ever so slightly out of place when its disc is just about to overlap them. The light from these stars is NOT being bent - it keeps going in a straight line, but the Sun's gravity slightly alters the very idea of straight in its immediate vicinity. The effect is a tiny distorsion, about 0.00048 degrees.<p>And the Sun is not exactly small.... but it's not dense enough to have a strong effect. Nothing in our everyday experience is. If you could stuff all of its mass into a tiny volume then in its immediate vicinity you could experience this.",1355655282

Every person has a file whether they think they do or not. This file will only ever be used against you.</i><p>And Europe remembers such a thing... it was only 1990 that the Stasi was dissolved. Yet here we are constructing an even more powerful and permanent version of ""a file on everyone"".<p>My brother's demonstration was a worker's one, not political. But don't you see that if attending a political rally risks arrest and permanent repercussions, even if you were innocent of everything save for having an opinion... then are we not already at the point in which to hold an alternate political view is to risk inserting something into your file (it exists anyway) which could permanently affect your life.<p>Who knows what the future holds, but for my brother it's unlikely to involve working for a company that ever expects travel to the USA. Thus, one is forced to modify their behaviour to avoid being penalised by the current system.<p>Isn't that what the effect of the Stasi was?<p>I mean, being European, I find it hard to see how history isn't repeating itself on an ever grander scale now that there are tools that allow it to do so.",1355654416

They realized that security through innspecting every person and every square centimeter of luggage is too expensive and isn't as effective.<p>A lot of their security at airports depends on picking out people and just asking them a random question or two ('why are you here') and seeing the response. If you have ever been asked the time, or the directions to the mens room, or about a flight from a tourist looking person at an Israel airport, chances are that they may have been an agent. There is a front-line of plain clothed who look around on the ground and pass on potential targets to uniformed officers.<p>There was a paper I remember reading sub-titled ""Can you really catch terrorist by asking them if they are terrorists"" and the conclusion was that yes, you can - and you do - and not because you know they will answer 'no', but by how they answer and their body language, among other factors (much of which modern governments keep secret).<p>There was sometime in how your brother answered that steered them towards not allowing him in.

Not to mention Flickr has no barrier to entry, you upload your photos and don't have to worry about paying for a third party service like S3.<p>It's nice to dream that an open source Mozilla project can steal some of Flickr's thunder, but it isn't going to be happening any time soon.",1355652562

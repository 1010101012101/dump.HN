It's interesting how in his interaction with his audience people have an enormous problem letting go of their usual frame of reference.<p>The Dolphin example is a great one because just like with chimps (or pigs!) there is obviously some modicum of intelligence there, it's an alien one because of the lack of shared references but it comes with all the ethical issues that the discovery of an extra-terristrial species of similar capability would have.<p>I'm pretty sure that there are some ethical lines that you probably shouldn't cross with any creature, intelligent or not, and we're a long way away from even establishing those boundaries (as per our imagined feelings placing ourselves in the shoes of the subject).<p>Dolphins are mammals, have adapted to living immersed in a 3D salt water environment, I wonder how we'd feel if they would be able to communicate and declared that henceforth ships are to pay toll or else :)<p>It would be a sad day for biologists and there would be a glut of Dolphin steak if our past with other species is any lesson.",1262577501

If you accept that this project is going to be mostly about marketing, then the question answers itself - you take a niche approach because it makes the marketing easier.<p>The statement ""makes the marketing easier"" rests on 2 assumptions:<p>1.) you will have on your team someone from the niche that you are targeting<p>2.) you are willing to share revenue so as to avoid the expense of marketing<p>Again, if you have $10 million to spend on marketing, you could take a brute-force approach and try to do a generic site and just market the hell out of it. But if your marketing budget is $0, then lining up partners who are in the niche that you are targeting is a wise move.<p>Above (in another comment) I listed 4 attributes I'd look for in the partner who is in the niche that I'm going after. The important thing is that they have some videos to sell, and the ambition to want to go out and make the site a monster hit. That way you can leave a lot of the marketing work to them. Again, my reference here is what Tilak Pyle was able to do for iHanuman. His video was the best selling thing on iHanuman, and its sales were an important part of what made that site seem legitimate to the other yoga teachers who eventually joined the site.<p>You write:<p>""just changing the theme of the site.""<p>I think that is an astonishing phrase. You are seriously discounting the importance of marketing. You are seriously discounting branding and the value of good graphic design.<p>You wrote:<p>""my main focus right now is a niche: independent films""<p>If I were to try this again, I'd go after consumer niches, not producer niches. I mean, the niche should be defined by the consumer group, not the producer group. The niches I'm thinking of are the consumer niches: cooking, hunting, racing, gambling, yoga, health, stock market trading, etc.<p>You wrote:<p>""but that's assuming I'm trying to build a marketplace""<p>Sorry, I must have misunderstood you. What are you building then? I can not imagine how you would bring distribution to indie film makers without building a marketplace. If you are not selling then what are you doing for them?<p>You wrote:<p>""And even then, categorizing videos should suffice.""<p>You may have better luck than what I've seen in the past. I certainly wish you luck. I can tell you, with great certainty, that the enthusiasm that the yoga teachers showed for iHanuman would not have been there had we simply had a generic sell-videos site that just happened to have a ""yoga"" category. The marketing strategy that worked for iHanuman was ""We belong to your community. We are one of you."" After all, doesn't Amazon have a digital video sales channel at this point? The yoga teachers could just use that if they wanted some soulless, generic service.<p>You wrote:<p>""I also think focusing on any of the niches you suggested would just narrow the potential customer base (considering content producers as customers), even though it may make stuff easier to find for end users.""<p>It seems to me that this is the essence of your business plan, and it is the crux of where you and I see things differently. What you describe is exactly what I think will fail. However, I certainly wish you luck. I've known a lot of good folks who tried to launch similar services and I know it is a tough market to crack. If you can make this work, then you'll have succeeded at a terrific challenge. I do not think it will work, but I wish you well.",1262577190

I think the Guinea Pig I had when I was 8 was about as low down the evolutionary scale as I could have any understanding at all (lots of squeaks meant ""hungry"").<p>My Gerbil was a black box, I fed him and cleaned his cage and he ran around for a few years, but other than that, not a lot to say. My cat and dog, on the other hand, most definitely told me when he wanted outside, or didn't like this brand of food, or needed his litter box changed, or was unhappy when we moved, was cold, needed into a room and the door was closed, was happy to see me after a long trip, etc. All it took was a little bit of observation.<p>Research into Apes and Dolphins seems to have revealed very similar levels of two-way interaction.<p>I'm not saying they were particularly interesting conversations, but there was definitely an effort to communicate something by both parties and we managed to understand each other I think a fair amount of the time.",1262576909

That's a super-simple nervous system. Many plants do this as well, using a slow production of chemicals which move branches and leaves.<p>As you get more advanced, going up the biological totem pole, every creature uses that exact same sensor => action mechanism.

For example a sensor scanning the road able to warn the driver of black ice, or at least inform the driver that they may be seeing rain on their windshield but it's freezing on the ground. Maybe speed controls based on real time weather conditions. No one should be going over 40MPH on any road in the snow. How about using cars as a way to measure road safety? Monitor the road conditions and the cars traction and report this information to the DOT so a plow/sander can be dispatched to particularly bad areas.",1262575486

It'd be great if HN comments could be made to appear in the comment areas of the posts themselves. And here's why:<p>The conversation gets bifurcated otherwise.  Some post authors will recognize and manually compensate by updating the post with a link to the HN comments but that requires awareness & manual intervention of the author.  Granted, it can be argued that comments are already distributed amongst silos like Friend Feed, Twitter, FB, etc. But HN comments tend to be such high quality and they're only exposed to the sliver of people that happen to come to the post via HN. Making them sync to the comments of the post itself would expose the rest of the world to the high-quality discussion occurring here.<p>I'm no expert on how comments work but is there a way to implement this with minimal engineering by making use of the track back feature? What are the negative implications for doing so? If it's not possible or proper use of that feature, it seems like they could integrate w/ Disqus, Intense Debate, Wordpress, Typepad and Blogger and thereby cover 90% of the comment systems out there.<p>At any rate, this is how I wish it worked and it seems like there might already be a convenient mechanism for doing it.<p>Thoughts?<p>sean",1262575002

That's not a moral statement, either; that's a descriptive statement of what the current situation is. That is the way it is because it <i>must</i> be that way. Rights are, ultimately, the power to draw on the resources of others in the society (even ""the right to free speech"" is nothing more and nothing less than the right to draw on the resources of the society to defend your free speech), and for every such draw there must be a corresponding <i>obligation</i> or your putative ""right"" will draw against a non-existent account. While we like to think about the positive side of ""rights"", without the corresponding obligations they literally <i>don't exist</i>; phantoms tools that appear to exist right up to the moment when you pick one up whereupon it is revealed to be a trick of the light.<p>Babies are lent their basic rights against their future obligations, and the difference is made up by their parents. Babies and children are extended fewer rights because of their decreased ability to service the resulting obligations, too, so your example isn't even all that great as children's rights are necessarily quite curtailed.<p>Certainly our law could easily deal with obligationless-psuedorights enjoyed by animals, but our society can not deal with them having true rights. Dolphins can be extended unilateral protection, but they can't have actual <i>rights</i> until they can also discharge the resulting obligations.<p>Some would define ""right"" to include this sort of ""unilateral protection"" but I think that strips us of a valuable word, and encourages category errors as what are ""unilateral protections"" one minute silently get upgraded to ""rights"" (as I have defined them) the next. I am quite certain this is considered desirable by animal ""rights"" advocate, even if they are not consciously using this exact line of thought. I'm fairly confident that if you asked, animal rights activists would not care to be classified as animal-""unilateral protection"" advocates.<p>(Moreover, giving dolphins rights would just be an open invitation to yet more corruption, in the form of ""legal representatives"" of the en-righted animals suing in the legal system for some recompense or other which oh-so-coincidentally will go back in the pockets of the representatives. If we're <i>really</i> lucky we'll set up a parallel ""animal's right court"" so the whole system can be set up as a rent-extraction racket. There is in fact an upper limit on how much of this sort of corruption we can tolerate as a society.)<p>(Applying my definition of ""right"" to the current discussion of a ""health-care right"" is an interesting exercise left to the reader.

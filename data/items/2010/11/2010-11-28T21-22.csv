At the time of writing only 219 cables are available out of what is supposed to be 250k+.<p>Sure, that could be because of the DDOS attack but it looks as though this leak is taking place via a new server at cablegate.wikileaks.org which presumably anyone DDOS'ing wouldn't have had prior knowledge about to route attacks against.<p>It has meant that the newspapers (who were given pre-public access to the dumps) have effectively ""leaked"" the information as NYTimes and Guardian have started publishing the details before Wikileaks actually does the leaking.<p>I'm wondering if there was an agreed embargo when Wikileaks was supposed to actually ""press the button"". I further wonder if this will negatively effect the relationship between Wikileaks and the media going forward.  Interestingly, Guardian which always prides itself on having data driven processes on stuff like this, has only released the metadata so far [1] -- I guess so that they are not the ones to do a complete leak before Wikileaks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-cables-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/nov/29/wikileak...</a>",1290981450

I know that most sites utilize some sort of load balancing at various parts of their tech stack. I'm wondering how this is performed most correctly. I've never taken a project this far, and therefor have never had to think about this until now.<p>What parts of the data flow do most people use load balancing at? How would you load balance your database and web server? I figure these are two that take most of the load.<p>When I say load balancing, I'm not really talking about all of the techniques that can be used such as serving up static content from a single web server and dynamic content front another, or caching database queries - I'm already doing that. I'm talking about actually balancing incoming user requests and processing load across a cluster of machines.<p>I know, for example, that mongodb handles its own load balancing with its sharding and ""mongos"" client.<p>I guess my main question or point of confusion here is this: when I think of load balancing, I think of a single host name taking incoming requests and balancing them across a selection of ""worker"" servers. Is this still considered the current way of balancing certain things? And if so, what things would this need to be applied to in the Web world?<p>Thank you",1290980833

Complete, utter garbage.  Poor APIs, terrible abstractions, namespace contamination, a lot of assumptions that those packages are the only ones in use.<p>Yes, you can slap something together quickly with the bits of turds available online, but when it comes to customization and fine-tuning, you will either spend a lot of time undoing half of what some other developer did with their package or writing one of your own.  For writing my own widgets, tools, and frameworks, I want a great language.  And when I build tools with a great language AND with a good language design approach (it takes both), I have things I can reuse.<p>More available reusable code is not an advantage.  I am coming to think that the more accessible a language is for just anyone to use, we get lesser quality shared code.<p>There are gems, for sure -- I will happily name jQuery as an excellent, extensible framework.

Sure, this is a classic argument against dynamic typing, but the practice shows the sky doesn't fall because of that, and it makes programmers much more productive. Also dynamic languages put more focus on unit testing, which is necessary for C++ code as well.

7838598,comment,7837628,7838520,4,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"> Btw, do SSDs make any significant difference for desktops nowadays? I mean, I power up my PC once in a day.<p>Depends on your workload.<p>Mine now frequently involves accessing far more data than will fit into RAM, and thus will fit into the filesystem cache.  There are only two options:  This either flushes useful data out of the cache, or fails to enter cache in the first place.  Either way, I&#x27;m going to be hitting either slow to seek spinning platters, or a fast random access SSD, even with a perfect oracle for an OS caching algorithm.  Sadly, current OSes seem to be lacking even that.<p>> Also, as I&#x27;m aware it doesn&#x27;t really help much with compilation performance.<p>Friends have seen compilation times approximately <i>halve</i>, even without a RAM busting workset (yes, they timed it.)  I&#x27;ve personally seen similarly extreme performance gains in compilation, again even without a RAM busting workset.  I&#x27;ve seen even better gains for those worksets that do bust RAM, especially if extremely IO bound.<p>YMMV, but I do not buy or build computers unless I can put a sufficiently large SSD into it anymore.  I define &quot;sufficiently large&quot; to include my OS, my tools (IDEs, SDKs, etc.), and a couple of active projects to fit onto.  Everything stays snappy.  I bought an 80GB back when they were $500, about twice the cost of any other component in any of my computers then or since (ignoring more SSDs), and still consider it money well spent.<p>I recently bought a laptop - priorities, in order, were:  Must have an SSD, should have extremely high resolution (ended up with 1800p, not 1080p), and only after that did I even bother to check if the machine had at least a decent amount of RAM, and a not entirely terrible CPU.  It doesn&#x27;t even have a dedicated GPU, just the little Intel that can do D3D11 at horrifically low framerates.  (This despite using Direct3D SDKs both professionally and for play.)",1401781617

My T420s runs a full featured GNOME desktop on Arch at 5.5w idle, 7w browsing, 10w loaded. 136 watt hours total battery capacity with three batteries.<p>&quot;Hours&quot; is a really poor way to gauge these things, because while it may seem practically applicable , we&#x27;re really comparing apples and oranges.<p>My T420 before my T420s had a battery run-time of 15 hours. I could fail to mention that it had a slice battery and an ultrabay on top of the primary battery and tell everyone that the particular model and OS ran for 15 hours straight, but that would be disingenuous. If I was a marketer I could run the processor at lower voltages, dim the screen unread-ably, turn WiFi off, etc etc until I got whatever numbers I wanted.<p>As i&#x27;m not a marketer, I also feel as if the claims people make about Apple&#x27;s hardware being better at power management are also somewhat dishonest.<p>They are a company that has ultimate say in their hardware platform and software ecosystem. No other computer company locks down production that much in an effort to increase the individual experience of each consumer. That lock-down allows for an amount of control that would be unrealistic to expect from the FLOSS community, as they have little power or say in production and ultimately must code to support a wider range of people rather than a narrow set of known hardware packages that are available.<p>My point : optimizing narrowly for a single platform is much easier than the opposite; a more fair comparison of battery life would be watts-per-hour usage during a standardized testing/benchmarking suite of some sort, along with the watt hours of battery capacity(although historically handset manufacturers have sidestepped that issue by having the software recognize when it&#x27;s being benchmarked..). &quot;Hours of use&quot; could be practical if it wasn&#x27;t arbitrarily inflated or deflated by uncommon usage profile testing and specialty optimizations for the sake of marketing a bigger number.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible to get good numbers out of a Linux build, it&#x27;s just fairly difficult for someone unfamiliar with the system (and sometimes impossible without doing the work yourself with certain hardware stacks). There exists a whole subspecies of Linux users that are somewhat akin to hypermillers who turn this kind of dilemma into a game and compete for lowest wattage.",1401780450

I would like to work on freeing personal data from the silos they are currently kept in and eliminating the need for manual input.<p>I got started by programming a prototype for an ambient location platform. As a result, I am fluent with the majority of CoreLocation and MapKit. However, I have spent the last two years learning about general Objective C programming. Recently, I picked up Ruby and Javascript. Coincidently, they are perfect languages to have learned prior to the Swift announcement by Apple (aside from actually knowing Swift).",1401778818

This is my 2nd degree, I am a mature new grad in my early 30s with a deep and diverse resume straddling audio engineering, music and audio software, HCI/interactivity software, AAA game development, and graphics/animation research including VR. I work obsessively at things I am most interested in, so if I am interested in your company&#x27;s product, you can count on me for great ROI. I have worked +5 years in research labs over both of my degrees, won engineering competitions and am developing a new file standard.<p>In academia I have developed several technologies I am planning to one day base a start-up from, that extend from music education/audio production software, through real-time gestural interaction environments, to 3D audio for virtual reality libraries, but I prefer to bootstrap these in my spare time while working full-time for a company whose product I firmly believe in.  I am looking for any position that can combine my domain and programming experience.",1401778814

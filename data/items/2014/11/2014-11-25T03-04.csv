8656266,comment,8656028,8656063,0,0,morgante,,,"The problem is that the supply curve is essentially vertical in the short-to-medium term. So even if companies are willing to pay more (trust me, many are, even if it&#x27;s not quite as high as I think it should be), they won&#x27;t necessarily get <i>more</i> workers.<p>Also, this is compounded by the shortage being of senior/experienced developers. As a hiring manager, I get dozens of resumes from new college & bootcamp grads every day. But we&#x27;re not hiring fresh grads—we&#x27;re looking to hire a few excellent senior developers, and they come along once in a blue moon.<p>It&#x27;ll probably take at least 10 years for domestic supply to catch up to domestic demand (I estimate it takes at least 10 years of development to become a senior dev). So even as pricing signals push more students to study CS, the supply won&#x27;t catch up for another 10 years or so.<p>So in the interim the only solution is to import foreign supply.",1416887919

Like the fact that I can&#x27;t stand up to fast or I&#x27;ll pass out; they know it&#x27;s because my blood pressure drops way too low, but they still can&#x27;t figure out why.

I&#x27;m talking about waking up and laying there for an hour unable to move or even speak; trying to moan or make some kind of noise until my wife finally wakes up so she can lift me out of bed and move my limbs around until they start working again.<p>I&#x27;ve had doctors visits where the doctor told me it was a miracle I hadn&#x27;t been brought in on a stretcher, and visits where they&#x27;ve told me that (and I&#x27;m going to have to paraphrase here), as bad as I am they just don&#x27;t know how much longer I have.<p>On my good days I&#x27;m on muscle relaxants and pain killers and I still am in horrible pain throughout my whole body. There is the pain that is always there and then there are the shootings pains that double me over, or my muscles locking up to where I can&#x27;t move.  And those are the good days; where I get my ass out of bed and go to work anyway.  Every 3 months like clockwork I go back in to the doctor and they look me over and run tests and occasionally they will bring in some young new doctor and tell them how &quot;interesting&quot; of a patient I am; and just in case you are somehow unsure you don&#x27;t ever want to be an &quot;interesting&quot; patient.<p>On my really bad days I call in sick to work and then I take enough pain killers and muscle relaxants to knock myself unconscious and I just pray for the pain to get a little better.<p>Everyday I wake up, I breathe a little sigh of relief that I lived another day.

Think the logic behind Uber surge pricing<p>If there are <i>too many jobs</i> and <i>not enough employees</i>, then you would not at all expect people to be willing to work less than the going rate.<p>Additionally, you would expect the price to rise <i>first</i>, as the most productive/profitable firms can pay a higher salary and still make money. You would expect the price to rise until a) Less profitable companies stop looking for labour because they won&#x27;t make money on it; and b) enough extra people, motivated by riches, enter the job market.<p>The fact that there seems to be chronically unfilled positions at every tech company I&#x27;ve ever seen, would predict that salaries should rise until they&#x27;re filled. But they don&#x27;t. We can make a few hypotheses about why this is. For funsies, here&#x27;s some:<p>1) Government immigration caps. There is plenty of developer supply out there.... <i>outside the borders</i>. We aren&#x27;t letting enough of them in<p>2) Greedy corporations. They simply don&#x27;t want to raise salaries, because they&#x27;re soulless MBABots.<p>3) Skills gap. As many people are pointing out in this thread: Most journalists&#x27; treatments of &quot;Silicon Valley worker shortage&quot; seems to be of the formula &quot;There are X unfilled jobs at software companies. There are Y citizens in the United States with certifications A, B, and C. NOW KISS&quot;. And yet this is pretty simplistic. Perhaps there is an abundance of (say) people able to do grunt-level IT work, but skilled software architects are in short supply<p>4) The B Word. Maybe all of these startups and brand name tech companies are unprofitable, and only surviving on investor storytime. Maybe they legitimately can&#x27;t afford to pay developers more. Maybe we&#x27;re all going to be out of jobs in a year or two<p>5) Location gap: maybe there&#x27;s plenty of talented engineers elsewhere, and they can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t relocate to California.",1416887544

In some cases, &quot;hasn&#x27;t yet&quot;, in some cases &quot;probably never will be&quot; -- it depends on the vendor involved if they have any such ambitions.<p>Most of this is drivers of various kind. Some vendors are better than others at upstreaming them and the other pieces that are needed, but nearly none of them have upstreamed sufficient amount of power management to make a real device useful and have reasonable battery life. There&#x27;s also usually drivers missing for modems, etc.<p>And, of course, graphics is a very sore topic in this area -- no vendor today ships a phone that uses an open graphics base. Ironically enough, Nvidia is the vendor that has done best here, with work happening in the open on their DRM drivers (but no products have shipped with those drivers at this time).<p>The vendors that have done best are normally those who have more embedded-type platforms and not primarily mobile phone chipsets. By the time upstreaming of a mobile platform is done, the next generation is already out and nobody will build new products with the old one. It _does_ get better over time as more and more share code goes in, but most vendors have enough of a backlog that they don&#x27;t see those benefits yet and as a result don&#x27;t prioritize it as high as I wish they would.<p>Then there is of course some vendors who don&#x27;t participate at all, or does very very little. The Chinese manufacturers used to be notorious here, but even some of them have started doing better as of late (Rockchip in particular, but MediaTek has started posting some patches too).<p>The vendor that traditionally has done best is TI, but they&#x27;ve gotten out of the mobile business. ST-Ericsson was making a good attempt too, and they also got out of it. Nvidia has actually been really good at working upstream on their 32-bit Tegra support, it&#x27;s unfortunate that it&#x27;s taken them this long to get going on the 64-bit support upstream.",1416887236

3. Needs to be snappy to use
4. Needs to be able to handle a Reddit traffic swarm
5. Needs to have individualization and customization
6. Needs to play nicely on computers, tablets, and phones<p>The person (or people, more likely) who is good at all of this just isn&#x27;t available at rates <i>the companies want to pay</i>. This is the important distinction. Hiring somebody for 100k/yr is pretty much the minimum ante for a good developer in a tech city. But these &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; and &quot;founders&quot; think that is too much money, and instead claim there&#x27;s a shortage.<p>In reality, if you&#x27;re competing for <i>top</i> talent, 150k/yr should be your ante, and be prepared to go well into the 200s. This shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise. To get even average talent from a consulting/contracting company, you&#x27;re paying about 125/hr (of which 60-70 goes to the developer). That&#x27;s 250k/yr. So why are companies freaking out at paying over 100k/yr for a full-time person who they can invest in? Hell, cut out the contractors and pay your people 200k/yr, and watch the good people come talk to you.<p>This is what Amazon and the like are doing now. I&#x27;m hearing 22 year old kids who haven&#x27;t coed a line of code in a professional capacity, getting offers of 120k/yr with a 20k signing bonus. Netflix pays a significant chunk of its engineers over 200k.<p>The only real problem is that it&#x27;s getting more expensive to do business in a tech world. But compare the skill sets that used to draw 100k/yr, and the skill sets now required to get 145k/yr (100k/yr in 1998 dollars = 144k in 2014 dollars). Before, you could just know HTML and some shell scripting. Now, you need to know multiple frameworks, how to deal with scalability, multiple data stores, &quot;full stack,&quot; etc.<p>If anything, the good talent in this industry is still dramatically under-paid. A common metric is that the company should make from you about 7x your salary to justify your position. So if a company is making 2.1 million, you should be getting 300k. But we all know that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening.

That does not actually distract because it is interesting watching someone tell the story when they revere the 6502 yet have not coded for it.<p>At the time that the 6502 hit the computer scene in a mass-market way it wasn&#x27;t like you coded your code straight into a computer. Instead you actually wrote code out on paper. Then you looked up the opcodes and typed them into a margin. That was what you typed in on many personal computers of the time. The BBC micro had assembler options that you could drop into on BBC Basic, so, if you wanted to do something really cool then assembly was an option.<p>This was in the pre-internet era where you might have a few books and plenty of magazines - piles of them, normally, every back issue kept. You could not Google answers and have some SO answer pop up seconds later. You would have to rifle through the indexes on the few books you had. This was not an obstacle to learning, you could actually memorise the whole instruction set and be fairly sure of what the opcodes were. So, in a way, you could be your own Google.<p>I had exposure to Z80 before 6502, I also had some 6809 and 68000 knowledge. However, if you were new to programming it required quite a conceptual leap to know what an index register could do. Then things like the alternate registers - what do I do with these, please? Hence, the little 6502 was nice and easy. Although there were just the three registers you could master them and do what you needed to do with just that.<p>To a certain extent the 6502 forced people to build a proper computer without getting the CPU to do things like drive the display (Sinclair). You didn&#x27;t really have to care about system interrupts for things outside your code plus the performance was pretty good in comparison to those systems that had a Z80 &#x27;do everything&#x27;.<p>Although Z80 might be a bit hard as a beginner, 6502 was a bit more manageable. With concepts learned on the 6502 you could go on to the other CPUs with relative ease, e.g. 68000 was easy if you knew 6502.<p>Going back to the talk, I had it easy - manuals, complete computers you could buy, even dot matrix printers. Plus community in those magazines. The generation before me that actually made the stuff I picked up they were on punched cards and reel-to-reel tapes. I cannot imagine how hard it was for them or the realities of how it was to problem solve given tools available. However, I imagine that leap is similar to the leap required by this speaker to understand the little takeaway here - you could actually program the 6502 without being overwhelmed by the size of the instruction set and, through doing so, get pretty good at it.",1416885446

8656097,comment,8653416,8656008,0,0,curun1r,,,"> The point-of-entry is still male-oriented.<p>I agree with this statement, but I disagree with the rest of your post. To me, it reads like saying that the point of entry for becoming an architect is learning to hammer nails. Actually programming a computer is really just the way we express ideas, it&#x27;s not how we learn to form them. There are more abstract forms of play that build the base skill set needed to be an engineer. For instance, I&#x27;ve yet to meet a good developer who wasn&#x27;t exposed to Legos or some similar construction toy as a child. Those toys form the basis for being able to break down the whole into its constituent parts. And that&#x27;s the essence of what a good developer does...takes a complex system and breaks it into simple, manageable components.<p>This whole discussion over whether it matters whether you take up programming in your teens or twenties is, to me, missing the point. If you&#x27;ve got a foundation starting with building toys, moving to woodworking and learning to fix things, you&#x27;ll pick up software development much more easily than you will if you&#x27;ve never been exposed to this kind of pre-programming.<p>The best example of this that I&#x27;ve ever seen is my parents. My dad was an artist by trade, which means he earned most of his money in construction and roofing. He never went to college and didn&#x27;t do particularly well in school. My mom, on the other hand, has a PhD in psychology and a masters in social work. As a child, she played with dolls and was taught to cook and clean. Both spent the vast majority of their lives living without computers. When my mom first started using a computer, everything needed to be a set of steps that could be memorized. It became clear that her view of the world is one of rote memorization and pattern matching...build up a set of &quot;recipes&quot; and then look for situations to apply them in. But those recipes are not composable. To this day, she can manage her Word documents without any problem and has a highly organized directory structure but is completely unable to manage her digital photos. Both activities are simply files and folders, but there&#x27;s no connection in her mind. Meanwhile, when he was alive, my dad was far more fearless in his exploration of using a computer and became very competent. He taught himself JavaScript in order to script Photoshop actions. For him, using a computer was a series of problems that needed to be solved and every solution could be unique.<p>So I guess what I&#x27;m getting at is that we waste way too much time worrying about how people get into programming and not nearly enough time worrying about how people get into problem solving. But that&#x27;s the key skill that makes a developer good at his/her job. And, as you&#x27;ve rightly pointed out, the points-of-entry into problem solving are still very male-oriented.",1416885226
8656096,comment,8652670,8655898,0,0,russell,,,">>> Rockets are certainly capable of accelerating a mass to a significant fraction of the speed of light.<p>Well, yes and no.  The speed of a rocket is limited by the specific impulse of its engines.  That means that hydrogen-oxygen rockets aren&#x27;t going to go very fast.  Ion thrusters will go a lot faster, but take a long time to get up to speed.  If you want to go really fast you need something really exotic like antimatter, but the technical challenges are quite daunting.  Theoretically you could use a flashlight, but the batteries would run out before you could get anywhere.<p>The allure of a reactionless drive is that you aren&#x27;t limited by the the rocket equation.  You may still need a big energy source, but your speed isnt limited by how fast you can spit stuff out your backend.<p>It&#x27;s fun reading to look up things like specific impulse, the rocket equation, relativistic rockets, even project Orion.<p>IANARS.",1416885201

8656094,comment,8653207,8654689,0,0,gaze,,,"I think you&#x27;re munging your terminology. Side-effectful computations in haskell are done inside the IO monad. A monad is not in general a thing for side-effectful computation. They are made unnecessary for side-effectful computation in o&#x27;caml because of the inherent support for mutability.<p>Indeed side-effectful computation can be represented as a monad, and therefore the ; in ocaml might be interpreted as a bind. Something just needs to satisfy the monad laws in order to be a monad. However, in Haskell the IO monad is explicitly defined. This is very important. The do syntax is sugar over monadic binding them together. In ocaml, sequential computation is simply scheduled sequentially.<p>In haskell, something of type IO () is a VALUE which corresponds to an ACTION which can be RUN. The function which returns the IO action is still pure. It is the outside world which consumes the IO action and performs it. In o&#x27;caml, functions are merely impure as in other languages.<p>The function that prints 3 and returns 8 in ocaml has type &quot;int&quot;.

None of those are getting any larger, although they are frequently reworked to allow better use of the volume available.<p>Very little of it is &#x27;weapons grade&#x27; and not many people have access to the equipment to weaponize it into a nuclear weapon. But turning any of it into a dirty bomb is trivial if you can steal it.<p>There is also the problem of accidents, why by definition are unavoidable.<p>So, you really do want to get rid of the fuel. Launching it into space is impractical. But it should be stored in a difficult to access facility where the chance of it escaping is minimal. The US federal government collected billions for the construction of such a facility, but it was never completed. So as a result, we have fuel scattered all over the US.",1428973148
9371468,comment,9368401,9371226,0,0,BlackAura,,,"No, he&#x27;s right<p>A bi-elliptic transfer is used for transferring between two orbits around the <i>same</i> body. In some situations, this is more efficient than a straightforward Hohmann transfer, at the cost of taking much, much longer.<p>For a Hohmann transfer, you reduce the ship&#x27;s orbital velocity relative to the sun, reducing the orbit&#x27;s perihelion to somewhere inside the sun. That requires cancelling out almost all of the Earth&#x27;s orbital velocity.<p>For a bi-elliptic transfer, you first increase the ship&#x27;s orbital velocity relative to the sun, increasing the orbit&#x27;s aphelion to somewhere in the outer solar system. That&#x27;s your first Hohmann transfer, going apparently the wrong direction, but requires less than 40% as much energy as dropping it into the sun did. Then, at aphelion, when the ship&#x27;s orbital velocity is lowest, you reduce the ship&#x27;s orbital velocity to drop it&#x27;s perihelion inside the sun. From that far out, and at such an eccentric orbit, that requires only a fraction of the energy it did from Earth&#x27;s orbit.<p>The entire manuever, potentially, could be far more efficient than a direct transfer. It just takes far longer, and if the ship fails to make the second maneuver, it&#x27;ll be left in an orbit that crosses Earth&#x27;s orbit.",1428973140

Fun fact: If a solar sail could be in a fixed position at Mercury orbit then it could also be in fixed position a Neptune orbit.<p>Quoting from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail</a>, the &quot;total force exerted on an 800 by 800 meter solar sail, for example, is about 5 newtons (1.1 lbf) at Earth&#x27;s distance from the Sun&quot;.<p>The Orion space capsule is ~25 sq meters. I&#x27;ll round that up to 100 sq meters (I&#x27;m being generous), giving a breaking force of 5/64 N on the waste barge.<p>The capsule mass is 20 tons. Assuming the waste barge were the same mass (I&#x27;m being generous) gives a solar gravitational force in Earth orbit of 120 newtons. This far exceeds the push from solar wind, even with wildly optimistic numbers. (Note: there&#x27;s some 50,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste in the US.)<p>So no, you couldn&#x27;t lose a lot of velocity just braking against the solar wind.

A GOTO that is restricted from leaping outside of its local scope is a limitation. A language with no GOTO is even more limited. A language that only permits tail calls is yet more limited. You don&#x27;t have GOTO unless you have a full, unrestricted JMP, and if all your language has are tail calls, you do not have a full unrestricted JMP. If you have &quot;pointers&quot; but can&#x27;t perform arithmetic on them, you don&#x27;t really have &quot;pointers&quot;.<p>All of these things are restrictions, as well as features. The idea that &quot;features == more power&quot; is not accurate... features and power have a complicated relationship, the moreso since there&#x27;s more than one useful definition of power, but they are almost no matter what neither strictly in opposition, nor strictly working together.

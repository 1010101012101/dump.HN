351129,comment,350980,351091,0,0,jimbokun,,,"From the article:<p>""The more people who go to college, the more stigmatizing the failure to complete college becomes.""<p>I think Mr. Murray needs to lighten up a little.  One way in which American culture excels over many others, is in our embrace of failure.  If you want to try to go to college, and end up failing, so what?  Do something else.  You're still in your early 20s.<p>Certainly, there is the issue of going into heavy debt in a failed attempt at a college education.  But that is different from people thinking less of you for having tried something and failed.<p>People reading Hacker News should empathize with this sentiment more than most, I think.",1225594441

It is in fact slightly <i>easier</i> to run a hypervisor on the original Core, and thus the first-gen Macbook, because the Core 2 Duo runs userland in 64 bit mode and the kernel in emulated 32 bit mode, and that's a gross oversimplification made as a small mercy.<p>In any case, <i>every</i> Macbook sold today --- even the cheapest one --- runs at least Core 2 Duo, which includes not only VT-x but also the advanced I/O stuff Intel did to make TLB flushes not kill performance.<p>Long story short: you can't buy a Macbook that doesn't do just fine with Parallels or VMWare Fusion.",1225593732

He said that the average student needs to know much more about the above fields than they know now, and so it should be taught earlier, so that most people don't need a four-year college education in order to have the core knowledge necessary in a modern society.",1225591630

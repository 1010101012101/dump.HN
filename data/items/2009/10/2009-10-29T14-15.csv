If I were have to make this decision today, I might use something more powerful and extensible like ""mutt"", but for me pine is just fine.<p>I started using it again a year back or so when Mail.app became too slow for me to use on some giant mailboxes I have.  Deleting 5k messages from an IMAP folder in pine takes maybe 5-10 seconds.  Try doing that in Mail.app.  I found my email productivity went way up after switching, so I ended up using it exclusively, despite the ribbing my co-workers give me for using prehistoric email tools.",1256828362

As for my computer science course, I'm pretty much frustrated with the enforced chemistry and physics in 1st 5 semesters of 8 semester course. That doesn't make sense. Plus it eats out a lot of time I could've spent over learning new things if I had 4 subjects instead of 6.<p>The courses in India also happen to be outdated. At my college we do VC++ 6 under HCI --> wtf?!<p>And computer science grads go through a combined 1 semester course of 'signals and systems' and 'digital signal processing', which again doesn't make any sense to me. No wonder students get below 20/50.<p>My point is, the time lost due to over-engagement promoted in these colleges could have been spent in 'finding out what one loves to do'.<p>Since students don't find that time, there is an evident herd mentality when it comes to furthering their careers after a bachelors degree in Computer Science. People end up disrespecting it by trying to do MBA, etc.<p>Nothing wrong, their personal choice, but I think humanity in this region of world could've given out more inventions and geniuses if students (most of us) didn't have this pattern as the only way of starting our lives.<p>If only we could too just roam around on road, pick a paper and scribble some maths onto it like Ramanujan used to... if only we all could be unique with the knowledge of what we love...",1256827756

If you knew what the busy beaver numbers were for a given number of states, it could be used to solve various unsolved mathematical problems.<p>For example, Goldbach's conjecture states that every integer greater than 2 is the sum of 2 primes. So far it has been resistant to being proved. But if you could convert it to a computer program with say, 500 states, and you knew the busy beaver number for 500, you could check it by running the program that number of cycles. If you did and the program didn't halt, then it would NEVER halt, and Goldbach's conjecture would be proven true.<p>Of course, BB(500) would certainly be an unfathomably huge number, so there would be practical problems running a computer program that number of cycles. But if you had sufficient computing power, knowing the busy beaver numbers would be an amazing mathematical tool.",1256825996

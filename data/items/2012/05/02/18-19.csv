3920580,comment,3918443,3918952,2,0,glesica,,,"I see the point that it is difficult to infringe a copyright purely by accident.<p>I may have over- and misstated the problem as it exists at the moment. I am still concerned that the Oracle case will push us toward copyright applying to an idea rather than an expression, as discussed elsewhere in the thread.<p>I am bothered by the fact that an API, by its nature, to some extent, <i>is</i> just an idea. You call some function with parameters of certain types in a certain order and you get back some piece of information computed in a particular way from the parameters.<p>So the function prototypes themselves (the ""API"") are really just descriptions of an idea the way ""a red bus driving across London bridge"" is a description of an idea for a photograph. They are more terse, non-English (or whatever) descriptions, but descriptions nonetheless.<p>In this case it would be quite a bit easier to accidentally infringe a copyright because copyright would end up intersecting with patents.<p>For example, a photo sharing service might have an API endpoint called ""photo"" that accepts some image and meta data through a POST request. You are starting a competing service. You are aware that their API is copyrighted so you call your endpoint ""picture"". But the problem now is that you've done the same thing the photographer did with the picture of the bus in London, you've intentionally wiggled around a copyright to do something very similar.<p>Could you be sued? Maybe, seems that you could be if you happen to be in England, but I'm not a lawyer. The problem is that this makes a lawsuit seem much more likely to me than if the API itself weren't covered by copyright at all.<p>And we definitely don't need more IP lawsuits.",1335985124

I am not disputing their right to set the rules within their own ecosystem.  No issues whatsoever there.  It's their product and they deserve to do as they wish.<p>Having said that, that is not to say that I agree with their decision.  For almost any business  30% is a huge percentage of gross.  In most cases the margin is dangerously close to or lower than this number.  What this means is that there are a whole host of goods and services that cannot be offered through the platform due to their fee structure.<p>Then again, it's their sandbox and their rules.<p>This is somewhere where companies such as Microsoft could make a significant dent if they keep their paws off the content creator's revenue stream (or take a very small bite).  In my opinion a 5% ""finder's fee"" is reasonable.  If they handle the financial transaction then there's the customary credit-card billing stuff.<p>Two things that iOS does not offer that someone could offer:<p>1- Less intrusive cut taken from revenues, as discussed above.<p>2- Open access to I/O, file system and various resources that Apple locks down tight.<p>As an example, if I wanted to design a general purpose iPhone to RS-232 serial cable, well, it's impossible.  You can make one married to a specific application but you can't make one that's a plain-old open-to-all serial port converter.  There are tons of applications in industry that could use such a cable, but Apple chokes the hardware side so tight that even something that simple is impossible.<p>Another example is the choke-hold on proprietary Bluetooth.  I'd love to create apps for kids to use to control their Lego Mindstorms with an iPhone/iPod.  Mindstorm blocks have built-in Bluetooth.  Apple's version of Bluetooth, for various technical reasons, is not compatible with ""normal"" Bluetooth.  The only way to do it is to purchase Apple-approved Bluetooth chips and get permission to build a device subject to their approval...but you can't build a generic device.  In other words, you are building a specific speaker that uses this chip and these codes to identify you and the app.  Period.<p>I feel that companies trying to compete with Apple are not seeing the elephant in the room: Closed vs. Open.",1335983640

It's more like a real, and challenging, college course.""<p>I think this actually may be Udacity's biggest strength. It's a lot more hands on than a college course, which makes it somewhat easier. But do you actually learn less? After thinking about it, I really don't think so.<p>With your average college CS class they spend a few minutes talking about some problem, and then you spend a week on your own working on it. Whereas with Udacity they actually teach you all the concepts you need to solve the problem, and then you work through it together step by step.<p>The strength of the traditional college approach is that it teaches you to be resourceful to some extent. But this comes at an <i>enormous</i> cost. You basically spend all week writing shitty code and trying to make it compile just to learn at best one or two concepts. Whereas with Udacity they are actually teaching you how to write quality code, but you still have to do the most challenging parts of the algorithm yourself. (And these aren't trivial, they often take several hours.)<p>Clearly at some point you do need to learn to fly yourself, but with Udacity at least you can wait until you're up to speed on the basic tools rather than being shoved out of the nest on day one. Even if it seems dumbed down, I'm completely convinced that you're actually learning much more this way than what you learn in the traditional CS classroom. And after all, the measure of a class shouldn't be how hard or easy it is, but rather how much you learn from it.",1335983264

Even though for most of the people a thorough understanding of DRAM refresh latencies is not important, it is still a very, very important read for every programmer.<p>Why?<p>The answer is easy: Almost everything in modern computers is about locality spatial and temporal locality. As soon as the complexity of the programs you write is one level above ""Hello World"" or in Rails-speak a simple controller method. This will become important.<p>It's easy to translate the concepts of aligning data in DRAM because it's faster to Rails-ish behavior.

If you would try to join the data (speak aligning) than you would need less requests to the database.<p>Any system architecture that involves handling data will at one point in time come to the situation where the programmer will think about ordering instructions, database queries or even attributes inside a c-struct (see the discussion about why short ruby strings are faster than long...)

A classic real anecdote of mine:<p>We were about 100 people in a very large open space office. The vast majority of us were normal or nice. But two selfish idiots kept stealing/hoarding anything that was freely available. From coffee cups and plastic cutlery to toilet paper.

1255119,comment,1255004,1255014,0,0,stcredzero,,,"This little flash game has very high production values for artwork, music, and sound.  In fact, I think its quality is on a par with anything Apple ever did.  The interface would be a natural for a touch interface like the iPad.<p>Little Wheel:\n<a href=""http://www.kongregate.com/games/fastgames/little-wheel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kongregate.com/games/fastgames/little-wheel</a><p>There are many Flash games of comparable quality.  It is a shame that such excellence will never be allowed on the iPad under the current policy.<p><i>How to kill off Flash using Market Forces</i><p>If I were Apple, I would develop a toolset to convert flash apps to an iPad compatible target along with an outreach program to <i>encourage</i> the migration of such apps to the iPad and the Apple App Store.  If HTML5 is not robust enough, then Apple should develop a target based on Javascript or other advanced VM, taking care to ensure that a subset of the target is nearly isomorphic to Flash/Actionscript.  This could be done defensibly by drawing on prior art in programming languages, and a near 1 to 1 correspondence would make most of the conversion work possible through automated translation.  As a standard, HTML5 is in a better position to be the target, however.<p>License such an SDK stipulating that the app and its derivative works can only be published on web sites in a manner which is compatible with Mobile Safari.<p>The effect of such a program would be to harness a <i>profit motive</i> towards killing off Flash!  Using such a carrot is going to work better than the stick of legal action.  The latter has the side effect of making many developers like Apple and the App Store less.  The former would be an opportunity to reach more users and make more money.<p>You can catch more flies using honey than vinegar.  You can kill more of them that way as well.",1270911445

I also realised that I would be paying for the 10+ years guarantee.  Since I would be the only one using the chair, I thought it was not necessary for me. It makes sense for businesses though as they will be subject to more wear and tear from moving and different use plus don't need to worry about your chairs for the next decade at least.<p>The best way to help coders keep their health is to encourage them to take a 5-10 minute stretch break every 45 minutes or so.

There have been a lot of security patches contributed over the last few years, which have made WordPress a lot more secure than it used to be; this is why its security record in the last, say, 12 months, is a lot better than it was three or four years ago. This is Linus' Law in action.<p>Some of the suggestions in this article are useful, albeit common knowledge. The rest tend towards the security-through-obscurity routeâ€”they're not harmful in and of themselves, but by giving users a false sense of security (and making them think they don't need to follow other security advice, for example) they may have a negative effect overall.",1270911338

Most salary discussions come down to this question and it's a concept that's very difficult to define precisely.  The guy whose lunchtime conversations shape his colleagues' ideas may have made a profound contribution but if his own direct efforts don't match ""Has consistently had major success..."" then I'm guessing there's still a lot of room for negotiation - particularly if the employee realizes that making this case will give him a lot more money.

The function get might have different values at different times.<p>Of course, get is a pure function mapping (State a) -> (State a) a, and the value hidden in the state is different between successive function calls.<p>Now just treat IO as State World, and think of the compiler as the function execState initialWorldValue.",1270908311

I'd actually be shocked given the drama surrounding this device if it had come out as a thoroughly polished competitor.<p>Besides, isn't their next meal ticket much more about the form factor than the actual iPad? I mean, isn't the JooJoo pad or any other small enough to be mobile, but big enough to read on device just as good for Wired or any other company to build on?<p>I really hope it's the form factor that becomes popular and not just the iPad.",1270908111

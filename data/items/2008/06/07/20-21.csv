All these changes took the ROI on advertising from about 1:1 to about 3:1 where it is now. It seems to be almost all about the landing page and the web site, at least in my experience.<p>Before I focused on marketing, I spent a solid year just improving the game with negligible financial effect. The first month I spent enhancing the website had 10x more effect than all the game play improvements I've ever done.",1212871842

When their business depends on yours it's obvious they need to pay you or ultimately suffer the higher cost to them of having to maintain your code-base themselves.<p>When you're talking about some dinky utility a non-technical end-user may use then you're probably smarter to go the shareware route.<p>One thing to worry a little about is how to protect yourself from competitors that may try to compete with you using your own code.  If you're the sole owner of your core technology and there isn't any significant secret factual information in it then you're probably safe going open source with the appropriate licensing.",1212870854

Its problem is that it adds on complex, unneeded features to a simple idea.<p>That's what made Twitter so huge: its astounding simplicity. It lost points for being TOO simple and for having downtime, but that's what made it huge. Tumblr has that feel to it: that feeling that it's as simple as it can get, with a few exceptions. It's an exhilarating feeling.<p>Plurk doesn't have that. It feels to me like Twitter with clutter.",1212870698

211689,comment,211294,211294,0,0,petercooper,,,"I've been a ""solopreneur"" for almost ten years now. It is only in the last few years I have had significant (where I take ""significant"" to mean an income in the top 10% or so - which isn't a massive amount, but enough to live well).<p>The important thing I've found is to build assets that have the potential to creative passive (or near-passive) income and then run those in parallel to your more experimental ideas. Ideally, you can then sell off some of those assets when you need more time or more cash to put into other ideas.<p>On my part, I started a code snippets repository a few years ago. Only took 24 hours to do the first version, then it got another few days work a year on. It made about $800 a month for a couple of years, then I sold it for $30k. Not giant money but that's just one of many projects. I sold another one for a lot more just several months later. Having savings and a passive income that pays all your bills makes it a lot easier to work on the bigger and more experimental projects!<p>As to the ""why"".. I as in full-time work for almost a year after leaving school, and it didn't click with me at all. I wanted to run everything. So I became self-employed, and despite earning a pittance for the first few years, it was totally worth it. Besides, none of my friends are technically or academically minded, and I don't know anyone like that who lives nearby, so I'll be dreaming and working on my own for the foreseeable future :)<p>I should point out, however, that when I reach a point where I <i>need</i> other people to launch larger scale projects, I will happily hire them.. online! Just because you're on your own doesn't mean you do everything alone. You always have to rely on other people and companies, whether it's for your hosting, graphic design, printing, or whatever. If you live in the general economy, you're never as ""solo"" as you think.",1212870143

211677,comment,211540,211540,0,0,lux,,,"To be honest, open source doesn't really benefit the company doing it nearly as much as it benefits the users.  Most of them essentially get something for nothing.  And nowadays, it's no news story to be open source, so the extra marketing you get for being open is much less than it was 5 years ago.<p>Unless you reach a certain level, external developer contribution will be minimal as well (compared to what's done internally), so you can't depend on that for benefit either.  And as for selling support, forget it.  If your product is stable, 99% of people will opt for the ""we'll just call you when we need you"" option and take the hourly billing rate (even a jacked up one for emergencies), because they'll only need it maybe once a year.<p>I've run a successful albeit very small open source company for 7 years, and we're gearing up to release another major version by end of summer (www.simian.ca).  I really don't mean to come off cynical or unappreciative of certain users (we have a number of users who have been amazingly helpful, and those are the users that make it all worthwhile), but as a model for a new business you have to look at the reality of how well it can work and grow into a <i>sustainable</i> model.  Open source is a big risk for little potential gain these days.<p>My advice, start a company that offers a subscription-based service or boxed product (closed source).  You can always provide APIs for 3rd parties to interact with, and you can open source libraries and other useful but non-essential bits.  But giving away the central thing that defines your company is a difficult sell.",1212869248

211674,comment,211630,211630,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"ExtJS is the one we actually use in our products...the widgets are just too awesome to skip.  I'm not entirely on-board with the way things work.  It's a very OO style project, and feels kinda like working with Swing or some other Java toolkit.  A bit verbose at times.  But, the library has so much coverage, it'd take us an extra six months to a year to develop those bits and pieces using jQuery, which I find more fun and natural to use.<p>YUI is a close runner up, and if I were starting today I might go with it.  The widgets are fantastic, the documentation is fantastic, and the community is large.  It also feels more like JavaScript than ExtJS.<p>As jQuery UI develops it'll probably become a contender in that space, as well.  But, for now, I'm just adding it to our websites in a few places where it is useful--that's the other negative about ExtJS: It's a ""drink the Kool-aid"" kind of library.  I've had a hard time integrating it in little bits and pieces, and it's turned out that everything is going to have to be converted to use ExtJS for it to all work together.",1212868999

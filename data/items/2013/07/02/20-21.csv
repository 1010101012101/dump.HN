When not using hardware acceleration, Firefox draws text with GDI.

When Firefox is using DirectWrite/Direct2D (i.e., is using hardware acceleration)like IE 10these problems don&#x27;t show up.

To help meet this challenge, we developed packetdrill, a portable, open-source scripting tool that enables testing the correctness and performance of entire TCP/UDP/IP network stack implementations, from the system call layer to the hardware network interface, for both IPv4 and IPv6. We describe the design and implementation of the tool, and our experiences using it to execute 657 test cases. The tool was instrumental in our development of three new features for Linux TCPEarly Retransmit, Fast Open, and Loss Probesand allowed us to find and fix 10 bugs in Linux. Our team uses packetdrill in all phases of the development process for the kernel used in one of the worlds largest Linux installations.",1372798335

5980601,comment,5977922,5979793,14,0,Silhouette,,,"Thank you for your thoughtful response.<p>I think I should start with an apology to the Chrome team, because I realised after posting that I was actually thinking of the Chrom<i>ium</i> issue tracker and its Bugzilla counterpart, not the Chrom<i>e</i> reporting mechanism under &quot;Tools&quot; and then &quot;Report an issue...&quot;. The latter actually seems to be a very good starting point for reporting a problem.<p>Regarding the more challenging bug trackers, I think it might be instructive to consider those systems in the same light we would consider the kinds of web start-up we often discuss here on HN. We talk about having clear calls to action, and not forcing someone to sign up with their e-mail address before they can even see what they&#x27;re getting themselves into, and the psychology of giving users clear choices and avoiding analysis paralysis. This is all good stuff, and it&#x27;s just as applicable to writing a user-friendly bug reporting system as any other web app.<p>Take a look at <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>, which is the top hit for the search term &quot;Report a Firefox bug&quot;. On that page, there are four big options, any of which might be what I should do first if I want to help. There&#x27;s also a text box, which has a label similar to one of the big options, a bunch of separate related links next to that box that again seem to overlap with the big buttons and additionally suggest that I might need some sort of plug-in to do something. There&#x27;s another search box in the menu across the top of the screen, along with about 10 other links. There&#x27;s another row of links below all of that lot.<p>Now go and look at <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com</a>, which is what I used to find that page. Except that I didn&#x27;t really even do that, because the one relevant box was right there in my browser already.<p>Suppose I don&#x27;t immediately give up, and I decide that &quot;File a bug&quot; is the most promising option on the Bugzilla page. Clicking through there, it seems that before I can find out whether I&#x27;m in the right place, I need to deal with a page prompting me to log in. At least, I think I need to log in, because there are form fields that look like I should on top of the 4 other text boxes, 4 buttons that look like buttons, 1 other button that doesn&#x27;t look like a button, 2 checkboxes, and 20 links also on the page. However, as a new user, what I actually need is to create an account, which is accessible via a link set in tiny, low contrast text in the small print several lines below the login form.<p>OK, so I&#x27;ve spotted that link, and I click through to create an account. The next page does have a lot of nice, large, clear text. In fact, it has a whole load of links that I can use if I need help on one side of the page and a load of things for me to read on the other side. This is a classic analysis paralysis situation: if I&#x27;m here to file a bug, do I want help or am I trying to help? At the bottom of the right-hand column is, in smaller text, a place I can put in my e-mail address to create an account, under scary-sounding wording about alternative e-mail addresses (which have something funny about them that I need to follow a link to understand, apparently) and about confirming things work before I can get on with doing anything useful.<p>At the bottom of the left-hand column of that page, under the generic heading &quot;Feedback&quot;, is what actually might be the most promising link: if you click that and then click &quot;Firefox makes me sad&quot;, and you ignore repeated attempts to divert you elsewhere, you get to what seems a useful page: a box to type in a problem and a place to add a link to the page where it happened.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m deliberately describing the system critically here, and I&#x27;m picking on Mozilla rather unfairly since Bugzilla is hardly the only bug tracker with usability problems. However, I hope that by being specific, I am making the point about how difficult it would really be for an average user to report a problem. I&#x27;ve taken more than half an hour to write this message, looking through numerous pages on Bugzilla to get this far as if I were a new user, and <i>I haven&#x27;t even got to the main bug reporting page yet</i>.<p>Just to finish the story, the actual page itself has far too many options for any non-expert user to be confident with it as well, even for professional web developers who use the system somewhat frequently, but this doesn&#x27;t matter all that much if most people never get that far anyway.<p>Perhaps the most unfortunate thing of all is that despite being willing to help, the first time I ever said all of that was in response to an HN post where someone seemed genuinely interested in why I thought there was a problem. I honestly wouldn&#x27;t know where else to send it, or whether someone somewhere might care enough to do something about it if they knew. Maybe if it&#x27;s here it&#x27;ll filter back in some useful way at least.",1372797714

In the meantime I hope that you will check out the Nimrod programming language (<a href=""http://nimrod-code.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nimrod-code.org</a>) despite the results that my framework achieved.<p>To the team that carried out these benchmarks, thank you!",1372797571

These languages are a decent bit slower than performance optimized languages. The languages towards the top are all C, Java, Go, etc.<p>2) The frameworks towards the top are generally lower level - they do less automatic &#x27;magic&#x27; than the more popular frameworks that handle things like validation automatically.<p>3) In general, it&#x27;s more likely you will have heard of older frameworks than newer ones. The frameworks towards the top are generally all less than 2 years old (excluding Java servlets which have just always been decent). This means they make use of newer designs such as non-locking and asynchronous connection handling.<p>When does speed become relevant? It&#x27;s actually always relevant as soon as your product gets traction. For example, 1 server at the top of that chart may be able to handle the same load as 10 servers towards the bottom. If you&#x27;re using a framework at the bottom and paying heavily for 10 servers, you could increase your startups runway substantially by swapping. However, swapping may cost more in engineer-hours than the servers.<p>Basically, the relevance of speed is directly related to your margin. If your margin is high (investment banking maybe?), then speed is almost irrelevant, you can afford a whole building of servers. If you&#x27;re competing heavily on mass market web apps, speed is fairly critical as you can out price competition.",1372797129

5980517,comment,5979384,5979384,12,0,a_p,,,"There are methods of handwriting that allow you to avoid hand cramps. The Palmer method of handwriting, which was popular in America at the turn of the 20th century, emphasized using the whole arm and shoulder to make marks on the page. In order for this method to be effective your wrists must be limp in order for your arms to slide quickly across the page. Instead of consciously &quot;drawing&quot; letters, you build up and use muscle memory to create letters, in the same way you naturally build and use muscle memory when you throw a ball. If you master this method of handwriting, you can write at 60 words per minute, for hours at a time without your hand cramping. Unfortunately, the Palmer Method was abandoned when education reformers in the U.S found it too &quot;difficult&quot;, because it requires months of training and practice to become proficient. It also required left-handed students to write with their right hand, because English runs from right to left and this method requires your other hand to manipulate the paper. As a result, generations of Americans have grown up using an inefficient, painful method of writing.<p>Of course, the manuscript writers needed to draw the letters in a calligraphic style, which necessitated precise wrist motions. So a writing method designed for brisk mark making wouldn&#x27;t have helped them.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not saying that I support forcing left-handed people to write with their right hands. It may be true that the Palmer method (or any right-hand only method) has a history of teachers using corporal punishment to punish mistakes, but corporal punishment is of course not necessary to become proficient.<p>Eksith, you&#x27;re right that &quot;drawing&quot; the letters doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the speed at which letters are made. The &quot;drawing&quot; comment was made about why many people&#x27;s cursive handwriting is so poor. When students learn cursive now, too often they are simply copying letters from a book or blackboard (&quot;drawing the letters&quot;), instead of practicing the physical motion. So when students need to write cursive script quickly, they don&#x27;t have enough time to render each letter correctly and consequently they develop their own methods muscle movements, which usually leads to sloppy handwriting. The same kind of thing can happen when you are taught to type. Correct touch typing teaches you to let your finger return to the home row after pressing a key before you reach for another key. If you aren&#x27;t taught to do this, you will develop your own muscle movements that are suitable for typing some words, but lead to mistakes in others.<p>A common error is letting your finger hover near the letter you typed when the same letter is repeated in the word that you are typing. This seems like an &quot;optimization&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t, and causes lots of spelling errors because it can easily mess up your key press timing. Using your own &quot;optimizations&quot; might be able to type as quickly as a touch typist in short stretches, but it is far more likely that you will make more errors.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Method"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Method</a>",1372796866

You leave out all your normal production development practices and just focus on the question at hand, then throw it away (or archive it) when you&#x27;re done.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you had a need to send email from your software, but you had never done that before. You might create a series of spike solutions that send a hardcoded email from your server and through a variety of third-party services, then evaluate the results. When you&#x27;re done, you throw away (or archive) the spikes and rewrite it at production quality in your real codebase.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like a prototype, but narrowly focused on a specific question.",1372796277

When i first read about it, i found the whole idea very inspiring.<p>When introduced in a former company, i really, really started to feel bad about my daily job.<p>It basically began as an idea. To fill our desperate need to keep the company breathing with a method. Because the company never really had stop growing over the past 10 years. We felt, development has become slow, a lot of technical debt has been built up. We had the money to hire more people, but didnt really know, how to bring them alive. Something that felt natural, when we were not so many. Long story, many reasons, blabla.<p>But i ended up being totally separated from the product. Something that i pictured living and breathing in my head. Now i had to report. Now i had to do a stand up. Now i had to measure. Now i had to make reviews. Etc etc...i started to feel less and less responsible for the product.<p>Maybe i have become tired of it. I can not really judge. All i know is, one variable was scrum.<p>You know, when you program and someone shows you something and you make wow, thats exactly what i need. It takes work away from me, i can automate, etc etc. All what scrum has given us, that we have talked more with each other.<p>One aspect that i sometimes mention to others too, by doing reviews and showing others, what i did, that all of the sudden i have to give away knowledge for free to people, who  dont give a rats ass to browse the source code or read the manuals. So i kind of felt cheated in that way too. Did not know, that i will ever feel this way, because usually it always felt like a giving and taking.<p>Well, so is life. :-)",1372795221

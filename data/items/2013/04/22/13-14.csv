Goroutines weigh in at about 4k each. OS threads are 64k minimum. That allows more than an order of magnitude more goroutines than threads, from a memory perspective. From an execution standpoint, goroutines managed by the Go runtime allow some nice scheduling optimisations, as the runtime is aware of the communication between goroutines. (some of these optimisations are in Go 1.1)<p>Finally, there is no reason goroutines can't be preemptively scheduled.

The problem is that you have to jump back and forth to see what part of the explanation applies to what part of the code. I'm also wary of making code readability too dependent on a specific editor<p>The other problem with using numeric footnotes is that any time you change the code, you have to laboriously renumber the comments.<p>That part really could be helped with better editor support. And if the generated documentation were, say, a rich HTML page, you could even have it so that mousing over a line of code would highlight the relevant point in the documentation (and vice versa).<p>But LP has been around a lot longer than I have been programming at all, and I find it hard to believe that after a month of dabbling, I have better insights into improving it than those who have been using it for decades.<p>That said, the more I read into LP, the more I feel like part of my problem may simply be that CoffeeScript's implementation of it is rather anmic. Traditional LP is apparently supposed to have macros that are essentially section headers that double as language constructs.

5589218,comment,5586519,5589023,3,0,belorn,,,"Overlay networks do not fulfill the performance requirement, and your comment completely ignores that aspect. Overlay networks would be perfect if we could. Who here would not use Tor if latency was as good as outside Tor? Who here would complain if Skype-like networks were decentralized? The problem with overlay networks is that you either have to sacrifice latency or decentralizedness to get them, and IPv6 does not - ergo, overlay networks can not solve the problem because they can't incrementally improve without adding critically negative aspects while doing so. Invent an overlay network which is decentralized and adds zero latency, and such network would easily beat IPv6.<p>As for NAT, you are making an Argumentum ad populum fallacy to counter evidential claims. NAT adds complexity to software design when it operates over the network. Proof exists for this fact through RFCs and large design considerations documents. There are also evidental proof that such complexity adds to the cost of developing software, with equal proof that increased developing costs means increased prices. NAT traversal for many services also adds bandwidth costs and increases latency. I have a hard time understanding the argument that increased development costs, higher latency, and more bandwidth would be neutral for the user. The fact that a large number of users, mostly limited to a single ISP, are content with higher costs and higher latency doesn't seem to me to be a good argument in favor of NAT.",1366638710

On the one hand, it's just a good idea, liquid methane is a pretty decent compromise between LH2 and kerosene in terms of Isp vs. density (both of which affect overall stage performance) and since LCH4 exists at a similar temperature to LOX it doesn't add any exceptional problems into vehicle design or operations the way LH2 does. But perhaps more profoundly, methane is actually shockingly easy to manufacture on Mars with a very small amount of industrial equipment (we're talking about mere kilograms, provided there's sufficient power available). So the development of methane fueled rockets is also very much a way to build the systems and technology necessary for facilitating exploration and colonization of Mars.",1366638007

There was nothing anyone could do anymore. We had to wait until the blood reached the part of the brain that is responsible for your breathing. We waited by her side as she was slowly, very slowly dying. The nurses said ""it wouldn't be long now"" Her breaths were becoing slower and shallow. After a full day of waiting we watched her face become blue, grey and blue agian. I once read the ability to hear is the last thing to go, so we told her in kind, gentle words it was okay, she could let go, she needn't worry about anything anymore. She could let go... Finally after eight hours of painfully taking short breaths her body gave in. She had passed away... Would a dosis of morphine been a bad thing?

These so called complexities has to be weighed against the <i>cost</i> of keeping patching IPv4 networks into still working as functional networks.

It's a nice, clean network again.<p>The cost of getting IPv6 capable routers should be negligible as anything worth the money bought the last half decade already supports it. Chances are if you haven't replaced it yet, you will anyway, due to stupendously increased bandwidth requirements we've seen the last years.<p>I'm not saying it's a <i>free ride</i>, but I'm saying it's a no-brainer.

You could describe the editing environment for one particular domain (like exploring and visualizing a statistical dataset). This should be data driven, ie. it builds the environment according to chosen dataset. Language should allow macros or modules in suitable languages for additional functionality, like complex validation, animations and transitions. You can export your view of the data, complete with your code and command history.<p>Tools for data visualization and editing  need to look like they are build for this data, for these particular visualizations.

She had always been healthy before, then she developed sudden pain which quickly led to the diagnosis of end-stage cancer. Though my mother had previously been opposed to advanced medical treatment (she would probably still be alive and well now if she had gone to regular checkups), she  agreed to chemo and radiation therapy. During the next months, her body gradually but radically declined. Before severe morphine psychosis set in, she re-iterated her instructions that no life-extending measures were to be taken. Her plan was to die at home, surrounded by her things, and the people who loved her, if possible in her green garden.<p>I quit everything to care for her during those last months. Our routine was to have short hospital stints to apply quick fixes for whatever was wrong, and then be sent back home where a nurse and I were taking care of her. One day she could not move anymore at all, and by sheer coincidence she was lucid at the time despite her heavy morphine dosage. We decided to arrange for another diagnostic stint at the hospital. There, she deteriorated very quickly, within hours. Sadly, she was completely delusional on that last evening so we could not say good bye to her. I had not even managed to get her some basic things like her digital picture frame or her favorite stuffed animal, because we had all thought she would be able to go home again. She was not. During that night she slipped into a deep coma, which was quite a merciful coincidence all things considered.<p>Because she had made sure that she wouldn't receive any life extending treatment, the hospital staff interpreted this to mean that no treatment at all would be given. I was at her bedside when she almost suffocated on her own vomit. If I hadn't been there to turn her around and make sure the fluid was drained as best as I could without any equipment or other assistance, she would have died quite horribly right there under the eyes of nurses and doctors. Next the day, her swallowing reflex had seized to function. It was very painful to watch, yet staff did nothing to drain the fluid despite my repeated pleas to ease her suffering. Finally, she died (relatively peacefully) that evening.<p>I can't help but feel after this, and despite having completed medical school and despite having some experience with terminal illness, that everybody failed in this. My mother should not have agreed to this huge amount of palliative care that put her through hell, for longer than was necessary and forced her to cope with the horrible staff at our local palliative center. I shouldn't have agreed to and then arranged for that last hospital visit. The hospital staff should not have denied her basic comforts and care on the grounds of a DNR. The entire thing was a huge screw-up.<p>Somewhere between trying everything we can and knowing when to let go, between planning and sudden decision-making, between being professional and being compassionate, there is a balance that we have not found yet.",1366635822

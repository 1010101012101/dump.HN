I think it's just something about Law as a discipline that it attracts people who can be very literal-minded and who at least in their own mind are moral crusaders. (Disclaimer: I don't know whether Carreon's wife actually does anything legal herself or whether she just married a lawyer.)<p>I think when you mix that sort of mentality with modern entertainment, you get quotes like these. Sure, we say, ""any normal person"" understands the difference between cartoons and real life. Perhaps Mrs. Carreon would even agree that <i>she</i> understands the difference. But she is somehow not convinced that <i>we</i> understand the difference. Jack Thomson was the same way; he referred to games as ""murder simulators"" and assumed that anyone attracted to them was merely 'in the closet' about actions that they secretly intensely wanted to do. Since indulging a normal addiction usually makes it worse and not better, it's easy from this screwed-up perspective to imagine that The Youth will fail to be satisfied one day with the latest violent media -- and will turn to violence itself in their craving.<p>There is another aspect here which is: the things that disturb us about others are usually things which disturb us about ourselves. It's about resonance. Normally if someone is being stupid people say ""to hell with him, he's stupid."" But let us all endeavor, when we find ourselves outraged, to ask not only ""what is wrong with THEM?!"" but also ""why does this bug me so much? What resonates here?"" If we apply that to Mrs. Carreon, I think we'll all see that we've all been on the wrong side of a dispute, that we've all been wronged before and wanted to ""get back,"" etc.",1341248389

That will happen.<p>Meanwhile, consider this excerpt from <i>Founders At Work</i>, chapter one:<p><i>MAX LEVCHIN: It was pretty funny because [at the time of PayPal's launch] we met with all these people in the banking and credit card processing industry, and they said ""Fraud is going to eat you for lunch."" We said, ""What fraud?"" They said ""You'll see, you'll see.""<p>I actually had an advisor or two from the financial industry, and they said, ""Get ready for chargebacks. You need to have some processing in place."" We said ""Uh huh."" They said ""You don't know what a chargeback is, do you?""</i><p>If Levchin had done nothing else for the world than dictate these words, it would have been sufficient. Every time I hear someone, often myself, utter a phrase like ""that business is so simple; it's just a glorified Perl script and some JPEGs"" I try to envision Levchin, reading these words to me.",1341248360

4189670,comment,4178321,4184591,1,0,betterth,,,"EDIT: Sorry about the long post, but I enjoyed being able to put some of my thoughts down onto paper. I won't be offended if you tl;dr it!<p>Apple is rounding a corner on it's iOS platform, growing from it's chaotic youth phase into a more conservative phase. We can reliably guess that we'll get a new iPad every April and a new iPhone every August. We'll get a new iPhone design every other year, and a hardware update every year. We'll get iOS beta in April and iOS release with in August.<p>I love that they've slowed down the rate of new feature implementation: watching the explosion of quickly unsupported Android devices all with one defining gimmick makes me very glad not to have picked a phone with a feature that didn't go mainstream.<p>To me, Apple is already looking 4+ years down the road with iOS. You can bet that major feature additions, while Google will often beat them to implementation, are already on Apple's multi-year plans. Sure, Apple may be a year late on a feature, or a year ahead, but in the grand scheme of my mobile life, one year is nothing (views like this, I believe, will be more common in the post-youth phase).<p>As we exit the phase, I'm glad to learn that Apple's support of it's devices these past five years has been consistent: devices getting day-one updates for over 3 years! An incredibly impressive free-replacement program turned decent warranty program. And of course, two years per physical design and only one model at a time means that there is both time and incentive for a huge third-party accessory market.  (The incredible third-party support of Apple devices can only come from a conservative process -- predictable patterns that minimize potential risk and maximize market size for accessories like cases, docks and speakers).<p>When I look at the chaos of Android, I'm doubly impressed by not only how effective the iOS infrastructure is, but that Apple implemented a model infrastructure in the face of competition that absolutely and utterly dropped the ball (introducing version 4.1 while version 4.0 is at 7% marketshare is embarrassing... almost as if Google is abandoning anyone pre-4.0 and saying 'not our problem').<p>My impression? Apple now believes that mobile is no longer an arms race or a race at all -- it's a core business that will be around for decades in some form or another. In an industry where all of it's competitors are struggling and failing to even bridge the software-hardware gap, Apple has rounded that corner and set its eyes on bigger targets.<p>So when I say I'm excited by Apple, I mean that I'm excited that I no longer have to play the new-tech-game. I'm excited that my iPhone lasted over 3 years and got day-one updates the entire time. I'm excited to own a new iPhone in the fall, trusting that I'll get day-one updates for years, enjoy a mature support process at a brick and mortar store and a solid feature-set that works across hundreds of millions of devices. I don't have to play the custom-firmware-my-carrier-is-shit game. I don't have to wonder if I'll get the update that Google put out today, or last year(!!!). This is exciting to me: they've made a mobile infrastructure all the way from them as coders to me as a consumer (and every step in between) that <i>actually works</i>.<p>As far as outside of mobile? Apple will be unifying their product lines around cloud services and introducing their attempt to invade the living room. (Their chief competition there, I think, will be Microsoft, and I believe that both Apple and Microsoft will have offerings that REPLACE a cable box / DVR entirely, not complement it).",1341248241

Lou: We basically had a group of cheapskates that were buying tires from a bike shop in the U.K. And then one day we got a box of tires that were the wrong color and when I went to the post office to send them back to England the guy wanted $50 to ship the box. I said to myself, Theres got to be a better way. So I handed the box of tires to my 12 year old son and I said, Nate, sell these on eBay and I have $300 tied up in the box. You can keep anything you make above that. And that was almost ten years ago. He sold the box of ten, eventually, for $350, made $50, he was 12 years old at the time, and said, Dad, next time youre ordering tires, order me ten more too. And said, All right.<p>So then 20 tires became 50, became 100, became 500, and eventually we had 18 wheelers pulling up into our driveway dropping off pallets of bicycle tires. And my two kids at the time by then were 13 and 11, they shipped 10,000 orders from the parking space in my garage, a million dollars worth of product in the first year.<p>Andrew: So, this sounds like such a beautiful story, Im wondering if, well, was it just that simple or was there maybe an intention to sell this . . . well, you tell me. I see that smiling, theres some recognition in what Im saying.<p>Lou: I think there was a point at which my wife and I had a conversation about my use of child labor in doing order fulfillment and she felt like maybe we should scale the growth back a bit, it was getting a bit out of control. And as an entrepreneur that was just not something I could relate to. Its like, Hey, if people want to buy the product and we can buy it and we can sell it at a profit, we have to do more.<p>So we eventually got to the point where my wife walked into the garage one morning at about 7:00 a.m. and my 11 year old was in tears. And when she asked him what was the problem he, in tears, said, Were not going to be able to ship all the orders before we have to leave for school. And she walked into the house and said, This has got to get out of the garage. And so we eventually moved the inventory up to Portland, Oregon. We were in the Bay Area, in San Francisco, at the time and we moved the business up to Portland, Oregon. There was no sales tax in Oregon. We reincorporated and started doing business out of Portland.",1341247843

It is an academic/research institution, but my role is a standard IT position.  I am primarily expected to do system administration tasks and small data management assignments.  In general, development is frowned upon.  There seems to be a ceiling in opportunity here due to both my ""lower"" credential (MS rather than PhD) and perception of what my role is by outsiders.<p>From a more general perspective, I made a critical error when entering the job market at the end of the first Internet boom (early 2000s).  I did not take a development job, but rather a test role at a large IT company.  It took me several years at that big IT company to realize that this colored perception of my skills and limited internal opportunities despite a MS in CS and significant programming work on the side.<p>I left for another company where my job role was related to db skills I had picked up but was a greenfield project.  That was enjoyable and a learning experience, but the project was cancelled and the entire team laid off in the early days of the financial crisis.<p>I landed on my feet in my current role.  The role has turned out to be quite different that originally pitched to me, but I have a senior title and pay level.  The job just doesn't provide much in the way of personal growth.<p>For family and lifestyle reasons, I will not leave for at least a year.  I have been developing some interest in statistics, modeling, and machine learning.  While I would prefer not to simply seek another credential, my employer would probably allow me to obtain a MS in statistics at their expense.  Perhaps this would lead to more interesting and challenging work, but to be completely honest with myself, my current role is where many people with that background windup anyway.<p>To somewhat worsen matters, I am often much more attracted to niche technologies (APL,KDB+,J,Common Lisp, Clojure, Ruby) than the market in my area seems to offer employment opportunties for.  I probably need to consider re-entering the Java enterprise programming world and not be a prima-donna about programming language.",1341247720

 - Includes an IDE
 - Free
 - Easy to install
 - Really easy to do graphics programming without using advanced language features.
 - Well documented<p>To elaborate on the purpose:<p>I am starting an after-school program to teach kids how to program. The end product of the course will be a simple but fun computer game that the kids can take home and run on their home computers if they wish. The schools computers run Windows, and I will be using their computers.
The course will be targeted towards students in the gifted program at a public school. The students will be 10-13 years old.<p>I will not consider visual-only programming languages such as Scratch or Alice for this group. If, at a later time, I do a class for younger children I will consider these programs.<p>This is a non-graded, purely optional after-school class. It is important that the course be fun as well as educational. That is why the focus will be on making a video game.
I want kids to learn how to search reference documentation for an answer to their questions, so a well documented language/api is a must.<p>I have ruled out the following:<p>- Scratch/Alice (too visual, perhaps useful for a younger audience)
 - LOGO (Not general-purpose enough, again, perhaps useful for a younger audience)
 - Lego Mindstorms (too expensive)
 - C/C++/Java/C# (too advanced – I would consider these for a 2nd language)
 - QBasic (I just wanted to mention this because I taught myself QBasic as a kid. It's obsolete now though)<p>The following are viable options that I have considered:<p>- Microsoft Small Basic (I'm leaning towards this)
 - Python+pygame (I'm thinking this may be too complicated to start with though, also a
   setup headache for kids... what do you think?)
 - Hackety Hack (anyone have experience teaching with this?)
 - Squeak (seems more complicated than I would like)
 - Visual Basic (6.0 is obsolete, but VB.NET is possibly viable, but is the complexity worth it compared to MS Small Basic?)
 - Just Basic (not as “polished” as small basic)<p>I am a Software Engineer, and will be working with an experienced teacher to make this after-school program work. Any other advice would be greatly appreciated!",1341247139

It feels like a categorically different problem to try to transition a team from one of those to a functional language.<p>I'm thinking in particular of this section from O'Reilly's Clojure book: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=I8KdEKceCHAC&ots=wNiLN6Tce5&pg=PA138"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=I8KdEKceCHAC&ots=wNiLN6...</a><p>They lay out a couple of algorithms in an imperative style, and then gradually morph them into a functional style. It's pretty wild: you go from a story, ""do this, then do this, then do this"" to a math problem: ""your answer is a list composed of f() of g() of h() of another list"". (Unfortunately you only get snippets from that link -- it's worth the money to get the whole thing if you're interested.)<p>Anyway, having followed through their examples and done some of my own Clojure programming, I ended up not so convinced that people who are good at solving story-style imperative problems will necessarily be good at solving math-style functional problems.

On the other hand, everyone understands search. My hope is, the initial extra complexity would be dwarfed by the ease of sorting and finding your files.  Because right now, one or the other is difficult: it's hard (or at least bothersome) to properly sort one's data in a directory tree, but it's even harder to find it if your disk is messy.<p>Now there are two snags we might hit: first, I'd like to do away with unique names, because they get us back to the old, difficult to manage, directory tree.  Second, to have good tags, you have to internationalize them.  For music stuff for instance, French speaking folks would like to use ""musique"", while English speaking ones will use ""music"".  It has to work transparently when they exchange files, or else it would defeat the purpose of default tags.

Over 12,000 project managers have become certified to run Scrum projects . Since its origin on Japanese new product development projects in the 1980s, Scrum has become recognized as one of the best project management frameworks for handling rapidly changing or evolving projects. Especially useful on projects with lots of technology or requirements uncertainty, Scrum is a proven, scalable agile process for managing software projects. Through lecture, discussion and exercises, this fast-paced tutorial covers the basics of what you need to know to get started with Scrum. You will learn about all key aspects of Scrum including product and sprint backlog, the sprint planning meeting, the sprint review, conducting a sprint retrospective, activities that occur during sprints, measuring and monitoring progress, and scaling Scrum to work with large and distributed teams. Also covered are the roles and responsibilities of the ScrumMaster, the product owner, and the Scrum team. This session will be equally suited for managers, programmers, testers, product managers and anyone else interested in improving product delivery.",1341246655

I am working a $DAYJOB while working on a startup, and - to be quite honest - I really chafe at having a ""boss"" and having to answer to somebody in the $DAYJOB.  My ambition is absolutely to get this startup off the ground and be in a position where I'm calling the shots and not answering to somebody who's ""above"" me.  (And yes, I get that you have a ""boss"" in an abstract sense when you run a company... investors, customers, etc.  But that's OK, I'm talking about there being one discrete person that you have to answer to and do exactly what he/she says).   So in that regard, I hate the dayjob.<p>But, as dayjobs go, the one I have isn't too bad, and it pays the bills while we work on bootstrapping the startup.  So it's kind of a mixed bag.  Probably the more troubling part is the sense of the ""opportunity cost"" of every hour I spend playing code monkey for somebody else, and thinking about the value we could be creating in that hour, and what it could mean to the startup.   When I think about that, I find myself getting pretty frustrated.  But, I like the people I work with and what-not.  And the travel is an opportunity to meet some new people, explore new cities, etc.  But, again with the opportunity cost... and travel wears on you in a way as well.<p>I guess that's a lot of words to say ""I have mixed feelings about my dayjob, but it suffices while I work on the startup.""  :-)",1341246339

4189490,comment,4189010,4189010,13,0,tzs,,,"> Their stated concern is that someone might ship an Ubuntu Certified machine with Restricted Boot (where the user cannot disable it). In order to comply with GPLv3, Ubuntu thinks it would then have to divulge its private key so that users could sign and install modified software on the restricted system.<p>> This fear is unfounded and based on a misunderstanding of GPLv3. We have not been able to come up with any scenario where Ubuntu would be forced to divulge a private signing key because a third-party computer manufacturer or distributor shipped Ubuntu on a Restricted Boot machine.<p>That's because like pretty much everyone who is not the FSF, Ubuntu has not actually carefully read the part of GPLv3 that deals with software that requires signing in order to install. Almost everyone just seems to skim through that section, sees something about having to provide keys, and then moves on. They don't read the definitions that define the terminology used in that section, and so have no clue whatsoever about what they have just read means.<p>I can kind of excuse it when it is just random end users or individual software developers who don't understand the license they are using...but one of the leading Linux companies!?<p>Another place you see this problem is in discussion of the incompatibility between Apple's App Store and GPLv3. There are people who still think the signing requirements have something to do with it. They do not. The problem is Apple's terms and conditions, which Apple requires end users to agree to before being allowed to use the store, count as additional terms under GPL (both v2 and v3) that are incompatible with GPL. The GPLv3 restrictions on distributing signed code without the signing keys would only apply to GPLv3 code that Apple ships bundled with iOS devices.",1341246239

There are more subtleties, of course, but in aggregate and with market efficiency, reality tends toward the case described.<p>It's a little silly that you would say that when you were just doing back-of-the-hand calculations to justify banning parallel imports, don't you think? I've already covered your response in my previous comment.<p>I'm not ""curious"" about parallel imports either, they're a well-defined economic case that has been the subject of plenty of research. There's a great discourse on the subject, since some of the primary variables in analyses of parallel import policy are price elasticity and regulatory effects. The modeling of simple example goods with perfect elasticity, like I was doing there, is not really a question. You only get more interesting results when you take goods that are exotic for having huge fixed production costs or price inelasticities, or markets that are highly asymmetric in the parallel importation context. Pharmaceuticals make for a great case, one which has really taken off in recent years. The Maskus paper that your article mentioned like a citation but then failed to cite for some reason provides a good jumping-off point. Kanavos et al. [1] then provide some real-world considerations with data from the EU; and Grossman and Lai [2] provide a revised viewpoint that considers regulatory factors in better focus.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://archives.who.int/prioritymeds/report/append/829Paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archives.who.int/prioritymeds/report/append/829Paper....</a><p>[2]:<a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/~grossman/ParallelImports.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/~grossman/ParallelImports.pdf</a><p>But I don't want to be getting too deep into a discussion about exotic cases here--those are just interesting instances of them. My primary point is that, like I originally said, the intuitive reasoning that politicians and people use to justify banning parallel imports is just speculation in the face of legitimate economic considerations. There's real economics behind issues of parallel importation that needs to be respected, and I'd like it if people would understand that before arguing in favor of anti-parallel-importation laws.",1341245441

I think that's what affects my choice in recommending it as the first programming language to be learned.<p>Still, personal experiences in using a language would always be different for different people. That's why i recommend asking other programmers for some advice, before jumping into programming for the very first time :)",1341244925

4189384,comment,4186373,4187858,2,0,philwelch,,,"Along with that adventure in Hawaii, the Spanish-American War was our one shot at European-style imperialism. Rudyard Kipling even wrote us a poem about it at the time. But it didn't work out and we gave the Philippines back to its own people by 1946. (Puerto Rico isn't independent because they don't really want to be, same as Hawaii.)<p>The continental US west of the original colonies was an interesting case. We only got the bulk of it because Napoleon put the entire Louisiana Territory on fire sale--he wanted to cut his losses in America after losing Haiti and needed the money to try and conquer Europe. We only really wanted the Mississippi River delta to begin with. We did kind of pick a fight with Mexico, but we didn't conquer the whole country, and even paid for the parts we took. Oregon was a disputed claim and we split it down the middle with the British. And Alaska we paid for fair and square. As for the American Indians, you have a point there but frankly smallpox had already depopulated the continent and it was practically empty. If it wasn't, I don't think anyone would have been able to conquer America from the American Indians--nor would any colonial power.<p>When people call the US an empire, they usually aren't thinking about the Spanish-American War. They're thinking about all the countries we station troops in (most of them asked us to), or all the Coca-Cola we sell (which the world voluntarily buys). We have a big sphere of influence because not too long ago, the world needed us to. We were the only democratic allied power left largely untouched by WWII, and our ""imperialism"" at the time consisted largely of a Marshall Plan designed to rebuild a continent that destroyed itself twice over, both times somehow roping us into the action.<p>Can you honestly think of a country the US has dominated against its will since the Philippines? You might be able to make a case for South Vietnam, and you could name maybe a dozen countries we covertly subverted, but outright domination? We didn't hold a candle to the Soviets.",1341244892
4189383,comment,4189183,4189183,1,0,Jd,,,"I am a relatively unhappy consultant. I have reached premium billing status within my industry, but seem to be offered to work on relatively repetitive problems that are anything but challenging. Also, although I've made a fair number of contributions to the ecosystem, the community that contributes back is quite thin and despite some positive press, I don't feel that there is hardly any impetus behind the open source ecosystem (full disclosure: i work in the enterprise).<p>That said, consulting fits my lifestyle well. I get on a project, complete it, and then am done and can pursue some of my other interests (music, poetry, human languages, travel) with a minimum of interference. As a long term solution I think I would kill myself if I had to keep doing this forever, but as a solution to make money for the last couple years it hasn't been terrible.<p>The problem is that the transition isn't particularly easy. Most of the skills I've acquired do transfer into other industry sectors, but I haven't stayed on top of the newest stuff in any of them (e.g. Rails magic, Javascript frameworks, etc.). I've thought about jumping ship once there is the crest of a new wave that becomes financially viable (e.g. Meteor) or even transitioning into a completely new line of work (e.g. management consulting/book writing) that kills less brain cells.<p>As of now, however, I am simply unhappy and seeking the next best thing. Creating my own company or joining a fledging startup has always been of interest, but my lifestyle doesn't allow a 60hr/week commitment as of right now.",1341244890

Because it builds false hopes which sooner or later collapses.<p>>You would be surprised to hear that my friends (girls and guys alike) don't believe me and think I am joking.<p>Not surprising at all. In fact I'm finding it difficult to take you seriously. Given how many mouths you have to feed. Your family will be really big which 2 parents + 2 parents + 2 kids(assuming) + you and your wife. That's almost 8 people. Maintaining a family of 10 people, their expenses, bills, health care is a costly business, Even if you have your own BIG home. Else add rents et al to additional expenses. Plus you have kids education + their expenses. And your own family expenditure. Unless you are earning really huge I don't see you will make it through.<p>Therefore even though you may want to. But still you may not be able too.<p>>>In their opinion, I don't know what I am talking about, and will not care about anyone once I get married. TL;DR, People, even daughters laugh at you when you promise to take care of their parents equally as your own.<p>They are just trying to deal with reality.",1341244867

It is just &quot;some&quot; function that satisfies f(0)=0 and f(600sec)=720MB.<p>I basically skipped (invented) the modelling step. In practice you would observe the download size f as a function of time t, and then ask yourself &quot;which function f(t) correctly describes what I see.&quot; I wanted to describe a download that gets faster and faster with time, so I picked a quadratic function f(t)=At^2 as a template, then chose A=0.002 so the function matches the problem statement.<p>Suppose instead I wanted the download rate to be uniform (constant download speed), then the function which describes the file size would be of the form f(t) = m<i>t+b. More specifically, the function would be f(t)=720/600</i>t+0=1.2<i>t. (You can check that f(0)=0 and f(600)=720, as in the problem setting).<p>In general, once you become familiar with the main function families f(t)=mx+b, f(t)=ax^2+bx+c, f(t)=Aexp(k</i>x), f(t)=ln(x), f(t)=Asin(kx-), etc, you will be able to describe real-world phenomena by using one of these equations. This ability to &quot;model&quot; the real world through mathematical equations is one of the super-powers that comes with math knowledge, but my download example doesn&#x27;t quite manage to communicate that. I will have to rework it...<p>For a slightly better example of &quot;modelling&quot; using equations, check out page 26 in the PDF preview:  <a href=""http://cnd.mcgill.ca/~ivan/miniref/miniref_v4_preview.pdf#page=26"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cnd.mcgill.ca/~ivan/miniref/miniref_v4_preview.pdf#pa...</a>",1384408453

I attended Pulaski Academy (PA) 6th-10th grade and played football there from 7th-10th grade, 1 under Coach Kelley who was then the Defensive Coach while I was a cornerback (and tailback).<p>As coaches go, Coach Kelley was smart, far smarter than any coach I had at Plano West, one of the premier school districts for football in Texas. He pushed us hard, had a great sense of humor, and was out to win. PA was also the best school I have ever attended (I also grew up in Rancho Santa Margarita in Orange County, CA).<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that while this is completely bizarre to find it on a Silicon Valley tech site like Hacker News, I honestly can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m all that shocked. Sometimes when you meet people, you just understand and know that there&#x27;s something different about them, a potential for greatness, that they are a mold breaker. Their current circumstances may be unexceptional, but you have confidence they will go on to do great things. I think this is of course what we (HN) share culturally with a football coach from Little Rock, AR: a desire to think outside the box, to break the mold, and achieve what little greatness we believe we are capable of achieving.<p>I owe a great deal of my professional success to Coach Kelley and Pulaski Academy, so seeing them realize this level of success by being different, smarter, fills me with pride and warms my heart.",1384408435

I&#x27;d guess the early adopters will be the companies already using desktop virtualisation of some sort or another who already find it a management nightmare.<p>This sounds expensive compared to a stand-alone PC, but in terms of all the licensing and hardware required for in-house virtual desktops, it&#x27;s reasonable.<p>The big difference is Amazon is now taking the &#x27;risk&#x27; for sizing the infrastructure for virtual desktops.

6730805,comment,6729915,6730332,6,0,jandrewrogers,,,"The problem is not the rationality assumption per se. It is that the set of inputs and constraints to the decision process  considered in classical economics is sufficiently narrow and incomplete that it does not produce a realistic output. Actors generally appear &quot;irrational&quot; primarily because classical economics simplifies the modeling process by discarding relevant context that influences decision processes for the sake of simple analysis.<p>Also, &quot;rational&quot; is contextual, not objective or axiomatic in any real-world finite computational system as a matter of mathematics. This is an important distinction often ignored. As a consequence, &quot;irrationality&quot; can be generally defined as &quot;making a decision from a different contextual basis&quot;. Again, this defeats the desire to create absolute rules of economics that fit in a soundbite.<p>Economics is perfectly capable of dealing with the complexities of real-world actors in theory. In practice, most economists attempt to reduce the complex dynamics implied by the theory into trivial theorems that are easy to turn into government policy. This is somewhat understandable because even approximating a pure model is computationally prohibitive. This provides a lovely framework within which any economist can come up with a narrow model that suits their particular ideological proclivities. You rarely see an economist that properly recognizes the constraints and assumptions of their model but those limitations exist nonetheless. Advanced computer science will allow us to implement the more general models directly regardless of whether or not the results are politically convenient, but it may take a while before we see it.",1384408141

6730783,comment,6729480,6729480,5,0,lambda,,,"I would say that Java is a more common bytecode than ACPI. Sure, if you just consider desktop or laptops, ACPI will be more common, but feature phones all generally include a Java VM, and the baseband on smartphones generally do too. For that matter, SIM cards themselves include a Java Card interpreter, which interprets a stripped down version off JVM bytecode. Your phone may contain two or three different variants of JVM just to make a phone call.<p>Furthermore, exactly what you consider to be a bytecode vs a machine language can be a bit of an open question. After all, Intel CPUs don&#x27;t actually execute the x86 instruction set directly, the execute microcode which translates the instruction set into the actual instructions that the CPU executes. So you could say that x86 is the ultimate bytecode. And hey, for a while Mac OS X had PowerPC emulation support, and before that System 7 has 68k emulation support. On the other hand, people have implemented Java in hardware, so today&#x27;s bytecode may become tomorrow&#x27;s machine language, and vice versa.<p><i>edit</i>: Can whoever downvoted please provide an explanation?

Now, assuming a modest 30% savings rate, after about 15-16 years you&#x27;ll have saved up more than you will earn over the next 15 years. So now my kid is grown and entering into the economy, in his first 15 years he&#x27;ll have earned what you saved, but have a fraction of your wealth. 15 years after him another kid has grown and entered the market and faces the same dilemma.<p>Today, BTC is unstable, the value fluctuates wildly, &quot;early adopter&quot; is a fuzzy term because BTC is still young. But this is the fundamental problem facing deflationary currencies over an extended period. The deflation rate, similar to the inflation rate for other currencies today, has to be tempered. If it&#x27;s allowed to get out of hand it&#x27;ll wreck the economy it&#x27;s meant to facilitate.",1384406347

6730639,comment,6729915,6729915,5,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Attempts to divineor calculatehow fiscal decisions affect the economy rest on the marginal propensity to consume, the likelihood that if you put a dollar in someones hand, he will spend rather than save it.<p>Why are economists always so hung up on the concept of saving vs. spending, as though one is inherently better than the other?<p>Spending is good because it stimulates the economy -- if 1000 instances of Joe buy some new clothes then the clothing retailers can hire some new sales staff. Investing is good because it stimulates the economy -- if 1000 instances of Joe buy a share of stock then the availability of capital to create new small businesses increases and new small businesses create jobs.<p>It isn&#x27;t about spending vs. saving, it&#x27;s about whether the money goes to something productive or efficient or it goes to something harmful or inefficient. If a rich person gets more money and invests in small businesses, that&#x27;s good. If a rich person gets more money and uses it to hoard precious metals, that&#x27;s bad. If a poor person gets more money and uses it to buy books and go to college, that&#x27;s good. If a poor person gets more money and uses it to buy cigarettes or to secure credit to buy an inefficient luxury SUV, that&#x27;s bad.<p>It&#x27;s not about saving vs. consumption. Unless someone is just stuffing cash into a mattress (which <i>is</i> bad and also stupid), &quot;saving&quot; is just consumption of investments, which is consumption by proxy when the invested-in entity spends the money. The question is whether the thing ultimately consumed is more beneficial than the alternative -- which is a question I can certainly see why economists like to avoid, because you practically can&#x27;t answer it in the aggregate.<p>Here&#x27;s a great example. The hypothesis is that rich people spend differently than poor people because they&#x27;re rich, right? The fact that they have money allows them to act rationally because they can afford to make long-term investments. So, if the hypothesis is correct, lottery winners should behave like rich people, because their newfound wealth allows them to plan for the long term and stop making short term decisions just to keep food on the table. Reality? A majority of lottery winners go on to declare bankruptcy.<p>Because it&#x27;s not about rich vs. poor. It&#x27;s about what types of economic activity produce beneficial results. But economists and governments are preposterously bad at predicting what those things will be.<p>Which means I&#x27;m going to be back in here beating the drum on the basic income. It provides the poor with a baseline level of consumption which they can choose of their own free will. The problem with need-based programs is that the government is deciding what people need, and they&#x27;re terrible at it -- and then they create an enormous marginal tax rate on the poor by withdrawing the benefits from anyone who dares to live the life of luxury that exists just above the poverty line.<p>Let the people themselves decide what they need. People in the aggregate are smarter than legislators.",1384405379

Microsoft made a huge mistake not releasing Office for iOS as soon as they could -- these people would all have bought it and remained convinced it was indispensable.<p>Now, most of them won't care (and probably figured out that Office wasn't actually very good at its core functionality, like word-processing and creating presentations, compared to cheaper, easier-to-use alternatives). In any event, the strangehold MS had over the enterprise where even people who didn't want Windows were forced to use it, is broken.<p>So... dream on.",1347890389

4532518,comment,4532312,4532312,3,0,redbad,,,"Well, his example code demonstrating the ""bug"" is definitely broken. But not because of any flaw in coroutines, rather in his understanding of them.<p><pre><code>    session = sessions.get_session(cookie);\n    if(!session)\n        session = sessions.create_session(user_id);\n</code></pre>\nConcurrent access to a global sessions object is obviously unsafe, even in a coroutine environment where ""You know [the above methods] dont yield to the scheduler."" I'm not sure that anyone advocating for coroutines over async APIs is arguing that coroutines somehow magically absolve the programmer from considering race conditions. Only that coroutines, used idiomatically, remove classes of bugs _like this one_. And that snippet is not idiomatic.<p>One ""coroutine way"" of handling concurrent access to shared data is by piping requests to it through a synchronization point. For example, in pseudo-Go, it may look like<p><pre><code>    // public, synchronous API method\n    func (s *Sessions) GetSession(cookie string) Session {\n        // return s.dataStructure[cookie] // bad, obviously\n        responseChannel := make(chan Session)\n        s.requests <- getSessionRequest{cookie, responseChannel}\n        return <-responseChannel\n    }\n\n    func (s *Sessions) loop() {\n        for {\n            select {\n             . . .\n            case req := <-s.requests:\n                req.responseChannel <- s.dataStructure[req.cookie]\n             . . .\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n(Another way is explicit locking, of course.)",1347889717

Have people coming to the site and clicking around to find stuff. But in the near term, we can't promise we'll drive any of our own traffic to the artist, so we're relying on the artist to spread it.<p>The other thing people have seemed to love is the concept of real-time stats similar to Google analytics. When an artist posts a new release, there's that ""moment of truth"" where they blast it out to their fans and then wait for a reaction. But it's hard to really get insights into what's happening. Who is listening right now? Where did they come from (referrer)? Where are they located geographically?<p>And then eventually being able to do cool things with all that data to follow up with the right fans with the right message at the right time.<p>We're also aiming to take a lot of things other sites have done (ie, charging money for a download) and making is simpler for the artist to manage. We'll deposit money directly into an artist's stripe account, for example, rather than holding it until they hit a threshold.<p>And we've gone back and forth about offering a free tier dozens of times. Our current solution is to allow anyone to sign up and get their hands on the software for free, but then they have to pay before they can publish a track. Among other things, we're hoping this cuts down on the risk of DMCA violations we have to worry about :)<p>Screenshots coming soon!",1347889311

After spending about half a day experimenting recently, our conclusion was that were going to stick with images, and just produce a hi-dpi and lo-dpi version to maintain quality on the new hi-res displays.<p>If you want a carbon copy of everyone elses buttons, with a thin border, slightly rounded corners, and a gradient/inset shadow creating a slight rounding effect, CSS is OK.<p>However, as soon as you want anything more distinctive, you run into cross-browser problems almost immediately. IE9 doesnt support CSS text-shadow and gradients. IE8 and below dont support rounded corners or shadows either, and they seem to have problems using the full range of weights available with some popular web fonts, too.<p>Even with a bleeding edge version of Chrome or Firefox, there are only so many effects you can generate with styles alone, and even then the results of fine-tuned visual effects generated by Photoshop are often visibly superior to a limited version of the same effects applied using CSS.<p>In other words, there is still no browser available today whose rendering engine can compete with one of the heavyweight professional graphics applications. Thats hardly surprising, yet if you read all the trendy design blogs youd think it was crazy talk! :-)<p>The thing that really swung it for us, though, was that most of the advantages of using only HTML and CSS turned out to be illusory anyway, at least for our site.<p>We do have to create a separate button for each label we want to use instead of just changing the text in HTML, but that takes only a few seconds with Photoshop. As I noted above, we spent half a day experimenting with button styles using CSS and never found anything satisfactory across the full range of browsers we have to support.<p>Having plain text in the HTML might seem better semantically, but its unlikely that we actually care about button labels for SEO purposes, and we still have all the same image accessibility hints available as we always did.<p>The image file size and number of requests might be important concerns in some applications, but if youve only got a couple of buttons on a page, its unlikely to make any perceptible difference to performance. They might even be smaller than trying to encode all the cross-browser styling information in CSS and/or adding various non-semantic mark-up in the HTML to support it, and that potentially applies whether you download them as separate images or you embed them in the CSS using the data: syntax.<p>In short, pure CSS buttons seem to have few actual advantages over images and tend to bring a significant loss of quality and distinctiveness in the best browsers and horrible degradation in older but still relevant versions of IE. Unless you actually need to generate the button labels on the fly  and even then, you can still use a background image  I dont see a good case for moving away from tried-and-tested image-based buttons to a pure CSS approach for most projects.",1347888352

A fact still lost on many people; there was an erroneous post about Bruce Willis suing Apple over digital property, which then spawned several posts saying ""TIL (Today I Learned) I don't actually own my music"". It worries me that so many people don't realize this.<p>DRM means that if I buy an ebook, it's mine to read. If I want to loan it to my girlfriend, things get complicated.<p>It seems I have three options. We can share one account, which means that if we break up, legally one of us will ""lose"" all our books. I can give her my device to read it, so I lose all my books while she's reading. I can buy an extra Kindle (or other device, but Kindle seems to have the most mindshare) just for sharing, which seems needlessly expensive.<p>It sort of seems like everyone should own two Kindles. One is for you to do whatever you like with. The second is for sharing. By this, I mean that this second Kindle is to receive a book, not lend it out. The lending Kindle can be loaded with your friend's account (n.b. this assumes you can lock it so the lendee can't buy books on the lenders account; I don't know enough about it to say), you can read one lent book at a time, then purge the account and data and start from scratch the next time.<p>Compare this to physical books, where lending just means handing over an object and saying ""get it back to me when you're done. Or, in the case of my copy of Watchmen, ""forget you still have it when you move"". :)<p>I don't like digital media. Full stop. It's too new, and too much a moving target, for me to feel comfortable with it. Even without DRM, things are still legally uncomfortable.<p>Again, if I bought an album and, sans-DRM, loaded it on my girlfriend's device, I now have a copy which is potentially traceable to me (iTunes used to watermark and/or ID3-tag certain songs, but that could be a thing of the past now), that I don't control. Likewise, just ripping a CD is currently legal, but still seems a potential grey area, and if I lost/sold the CD, wouldn't I have to delete the file? So now I have to keep track of physical objects to manage my digital files.<p>This is all very ""letter of the law"" and an unnecessarily strict view of this. In reality, the way most people would handle this would be to buy the music, distribute it to appropriate people, and just forget the whole thing. People also break the DRM on Kindle books to make them usable.<p>My view is that if you're going to do things of questionable legality after legally buying an object, how is that really different from just grabbing the files from TPB?<p>Until digital media grows up, and old media companies adapt their models, I'll stick to radio/internet-radio-streams, physical books, and DVDs.<p>(That turned into a rant.

One of the books we read in Swedish class had a character who had a single grandparent from Chile. That contributed towards her dark eyes and complexion, so that another character asked ""are you really Swedish?"". I was astonished even, since my personal belief (being brought up in Miami during the 1970s and 1980s) is that nationality is not so stingy. My father and his parents were born in Canada, but Dad became a US citizen when he was a teen. I can't count the number of friends of mine whose parents are both from Cuba but consider themselves patriotic US citizens. Compare that to my dad's mother's mother, who forbade her daughter from dating my grandfather because she's a Norwegian Lutheran while he's a German Baptist. Those being very different cultures, you know.<p>These memories come to mind because the author, who is raised in the Swedish system, uses this same definition of 'foreign;' and it's a view I find rather un-American.<p>So when I read that essay, which excludes from consideration the rather large sub-population of people whose distant ancestors came to the US as slaves in the 1800s, who are by now fully part of the American system, with basically zero language or cultural ties to any ancestral lands, I can't help but think ""so what?"" I don't care if there's a sub-population which did better ... and why is race used in one place and immigration status used in another? Is the correlation with relative income more significant? It's easy to see how doing just one simple factor analysis isn't enough on its own to be anything more than suggestive.<p>BTW, the re-analysis on that blog shows that ""the mean score of Americans with European ancestry is 524, compared to 506 in Europe, when first and second generation immigrants are excluded."" Because the original analysis shows that Europe overall did better than the US, then I think it's equally reasonable to interpret the re-analysis as saying that Europe does a much better job of educating its first and second generation immigrants than the US does at educating its citizen with non-European ancestry.<p>In other words, since most of the excluded populations are black, the US seems much worse at educating citizens of African descent than of European descent. I would like that to change, so that all children have access to a good education, as well as to social services to help with nutrition, health, housing, and other factors that strongly affect the education and well-being of children.",1347887982

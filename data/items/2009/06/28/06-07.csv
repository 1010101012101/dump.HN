Might as well say ""it seems a bit extreme to include Python"" just because the occasional app is written with PyGTK, for example.<p>There are plenty of folks writing applications in C# using the GTK bindings, which in turn need Mono. Tomboy is just one that's become popular enough that people want it to ship as part of Debian's distribution of GNOME (not the only one; IIRC there are three apps in there now which need Mono). So sooner or later somebody's gotta ship it by default to support an application, and then folks who don't have religious attachments to avoiding Mono will think it's no more unusual than any other shared dependency of commonly-used applications.",1246172357

677572,comment,677473,677473,0,0,barrkel,,,"The whole denial of the possibility of empirical knowledge strand in modern philosophy has long rubbed me up the wrong way, but possibly only in a way that is clear to programmers.<p>The denial usually derives from a distinction between the mind and the world outside it; things-in-themselves from the outside world can never be perceived by the mind, because all perceptions are mediated by sensory organs, they are all filtered one way or another.<p>But this seems suspect when one considers a simple physical computer as as an example of a simple mind. We model the ""knowledge"" of the machine as the state of its ""memory"", however we choose to represent that memory - flip-flop circuits or magnetized rust.<p>That ""knowledge"" changes as the machine's I/O manipulates the state through long chains of physical, mechanical operations, and looking in from the outside with our more sophisticated eyes we may see that the knowledge imparted by the ""sensory I/O"" may be more or less true. If it's less true (as a digitization, it'll almost always be an approximation), then the I/O or programming may have bugs; but if the I/O and programming are functioning well, is it true to say that the machine has not acquired true knowledge from its ""sensory organs""? That it cannot acquire such knowledge?<p>Empirical (or a posteriori) knowledge is usually contrasted with a priori knowledge, stuff whose truth is independent of the outside world, but is usually a function of the meaning of words (such as ""All batchelors are unmarried"" - these are analytic truths). Things that are supposed to be true independent of the outside world but not embedded in the meaning of the words are supposed to be ""synthetic a priori"" truths. But it seems to me that a priori truths come from the brain examining itself, that the only way such ""knowledge"" can be obtained, i.e. a state change occur, is by examining the physical process of reasoning itself, whether directly, or indirectly as a result of the ""programming"", i.e. the construction of the machine / brain's mechanism for reasoning.<p>These ""a priori truths"" are mediated by the ""I/O of self-reflection"", and are not actually a priori at all, in practice. The <i>knowledge</i> of the truths, i.e. the experiential sense of ""dawning on oneself"", i.e. what it feels like to experience a state change in one's knowledge representation, came about because of a physical process which may or may not have bugs; i.e. it is mediated.<p>So, a counterpart to ""we have eyes, therefore we cannot see"" - a lovely caricature - is ""we have brains, therefore we cannot think"". It seems to me no true Idealist can deny that he cannot have ideas.",1246171416

What you do is that you send interference to the satellite so it can't receive any data. Therefor it's always theoretically possible to jam a satellite that is receiving a signal from Iran. The BBC solved the problem by relaying through another satellite.",1246170866
677566,comment,677323,677323,0,0,itistoday,,,"I just finished watching the first lecture, it was very enjoyable as is typical of Feynman lectures, but what I'm confused about is the metaphor that he chose to give as an explanation for the reason the probabilities are the way they are.<p>Isn't another interpretation of that experiment (what I thought was the current default interpretation), that as you increase the distance between the two surfaces you have light rays reflecting back, and because of the distance (not the time it takes an arrow to spin as in the video), the two light rays become out-of-phase, and therefore you get constructive and destructive interference?<p>Secondly, I was also confused as to his insistence that ""light is a particle"", hasn't it be established that light has properties of both particles and waves? Certainly Feynman doesn't deny that, so why would he make that statement so insistently? The <i>wave</i>-length of the light ""particle"" is very important in calculations, and while this characteristic of light wasn't denied in the lecture, it certainly seemed to be ignored amidst the talk of ""little spinning arrows""...",1246170559

677560,comment,675544,675544,0,0,miked,,,">> So what do I think of sifting through the internet for personal information about candidates? It isn't performance-based.<p>Two days ago I made one of the bigger decisions of my life: I decided to abandon any attempt to salvage a bio-tech company I co-founded ten years ago. One of the other founders had a quite brilliant invention that I'm more convinced than ever will work. Yet, after ten years, I finally realized that a company is fundamentally its people and how they interact. His performance (narrow sense) as a scientist was tremendous. As a human being? Well, there's the fact that he's been in and out of jail several times for assault and battery as well as drunk and disorderly. And the fact that every time we get close to making a major advance he steps in to sabotage it, which he has done several times by calling customers, vendors and big investors and screaming at them. And the fact that he takes absolutely no responsibility for his actions.<p>Some of his craziness is apparent from his web page. If he'd had a web page ten years ago I might never have gotten involved and wasted ten years and a lot of money pursuing a dream that depends on someone who has failed at everything in his life and is absolutely intent on making sure he fails at this.<p>So, raganwald, it all depends on what you mean by ""performance"". One thing that I am 100% certain of, how someone treats other people, how much they complain instead of take action, etc., is largely what <i>I</i> mean by performance. One dirt bag can make everyone else on the team miserable, and drive the good people away.<p>I would never ask to log into anyone's social web page. I will always check on their background, including using search engines.",1246169986

Even if HSV is well-controlled by drugs like Acyclovir, lowering the overall risk of HIV transmission would be huge. In addition, HSV, along with HPV is one of those STDs that isn&#x27;t 100% avoidable even with condom usage, sometimes infecting people who are surprised given that they had always practised &#x27;safe sex&#x27; at least by consistently using condoms.",1391713170

Right now, connections to the web look like a tree, where a whole bunch of connections get funneled through an ISP.  That ISP has the power.  The power to throttle, the power to block, the power to record.  And that ISP can be pressured by other powers.  We need to decentralize so that instead of looking like a hierarchical tree, the internet looks like a graph.  With each building forming a node that connects to its neighbors.<p>Of course, the amount of work it would take to build such a web and move to it likely rules out the possibility of it ever happening.  I mean, how do we go about forming a movement to build this?  It only works, really, if everyone&#x27;s on board.",1391713144

It appears to <i>not</i> at all be what attracted people to it, which also means that it is not conveying the presumed benefits to its adopters. and 2.) That implies that it&#x27;s something else and is conveying <i>some</i> benefit to <i>someone else</i>.<p>So, with respect to those points, 1.) why do people continue to support it when their reasons have dissolved? and 2.) why don&#x27;t they care that they have possibly been misled, wonder who misled them, and why?<p>I mean, it would be one thing if they just said &quot;screw it&quot; and walked away. But, they just seem to blindly continue supporting it.<p>><i>people are trying to apply their mainstream values to Bitcoin</i><p>Exactly. The mainstream swooped in quickly and swept all of those hopes away. But, it seems to not have deterred those early adopters that their dreams have been crushed.

Over a half century to a century time scale the first assumption is almost certainly invalid (breeder technology is advancing) and the second may be shaky as well. (Note, btw, that a key reason why the MIT study assumed a once-through fuel cycle was not that breeders were not available, but that they were uneconomic at current uranium prices; but obviously if uranium gets scarcer, uranium prices go up and breeders become economically viable.)<p>Finally, a half century is not 25 years. If we have a half century to a century of nuclear power even with a once-through fuel cycle, we have an obvious alternative to fossil fuels for that time frame. Your claim that we will hit an energy crisis in 25 years assumes that there is no such alternative.<p><i>Tell me how much algae fuel you want and what conversion pathways (biodiesel, ethanol, synthesis, solids) you&#x27;re referring to.

I joined because after moving to the south from New York City, I didn&#x27;t have great access to Japanese candy anymore. I got a lot of cool goodies that I wasn&#x27;t familiar with before. I ended up canceling because of both cost and unreliable shipping (not bemmu&#x27;s fault). I only ever missed I think one shipment but my local USPS would really badly mangle them and deliver many weeks late.<p>I think boxes would be a great value and I would seriously reconsider subscribing with those, not just because of less risk of damage but the ability to send crisps. Japanese crisps are of &quot;high value&quot; to me and I was kind of hoping bemmu would start an alternate service just for those. Some of the candies that would ship I&#x27;m not too fond of (like the rice cake panda thing that has to be made that was shipped twice) and my favorite candies I can get on Amazon (evaporated milk candies are OMG AMAZING).<p>Also, a quick welcome package is a great idea.

Check both functions. They have the exact same # of comparisons and index calculations.<p>2. Note that Quicksort and Quickselect (QS) and Binarysearch (BS) are very very similar. Quicksort recurses on BOTH partitions whereas QS and BS only recurse on ONE. This is important! You don&#x27;t care if your pivot in Quicksearch is a little of. You still have to do the work anyways. For QS/BS you do care a lot since the other part gets immediately discarded!<p>3. Where 2) implies: Quicksort is harder to get non-recursive implementation. You still have to maintain some sort of stack even for the iterative part. Whereas for QS and BS it is very very easy to do an iterative version.<p>Now notice how you actually <i>worsened</i> the runtime complexity with your new approach:<p>1. A standard BS discards <i>exactly</i> half the array. Thus, after two iterations you discarded 3/4.<p>2.

Unfortunately this same misguided approach to security, or as I call it suckerity, has been carried forward into IPv6.<p>There is some hope that WebRTC and other p2p technologies might alleviate the problem but then the task of punching through firewalls with techniques like STUN falls on developers.  I&#x27;m not seeing an industry-led campaign to standardize a true p2p protocol based on something like UDP, because it would undermine the profits of data producers.<p>I could go into how the proper layering of TCP should have been IP->UDP->TCP instead of IP->TCP and a whole host of technical mistakes such as inability to set the number of checksum bits, use alternatives to TCP header compression, or even use jumbo frames over broadband, but what it all comes down to is that what we think of as “the internet” (connection-oriented reliable streams and the client/server model) is not really compatible with a distributed content-addressable connectionless internet that can work with high latencies and packet loss.<p>I think if this network existed, then extending HTTP to operate in a p2p fashion wouldn’t be all that complicated.  Probably the way it would work is that you’d request data by hash instead of by address, and local caches would send you the pieces that match like BitTorrent.  Most of the complexity will center around security, but I think Bitcoin and other networks of trust point the way to being able to both prove one’s identity and surf anonymously.<p>Tim Berners-Lee may not be thinking about the problem at this level but we need more people with his clout to get the ball rolling.  I wasted a lot of time attempting to write a low-level stream API over UDP for networked games before zeromq or WebRTC existed and ended up failing because there are just too many factors that made it nondeterministic.  It’s going to have to be a group effort and will probably require funding or at least a donation of talent from people familiar with the pitfalls to get it right.  Otherwise I just don’t think a new standard (one that makes recommendations instead of solving the heart of the problem) is going to catch on.",1391711070

For one thing, the environment that it has to operate in is...poor. The &quot;best of breed&quot;, most modern technology typically doesn&#x27;t like that sort of thing. The technology in your automobile&#x27;s engine compartment is also typically generations behind, as is the stuff in your toaster (for slightly different reasons).<p>Second, the technology of the manned program (and the same argument applies to a lesser extent to the unmanned program) is &quot;man-rated&quot;---it&#x27;s specifically tested to ensure that it won&#x27;t fail in some spectacular fashion and kill everyone. That is expensive, and takes a lot of time. One way to make that cheaper is to maintain a pedigree; what you fly today flew yesterday, or is based on something that you flew yesterday.<p>And then, of course, at current effort levels, building a new launch platform is mostly a non-starter. So, you might as well go with what&#x27;s already working.<p>&quot;<i>Spaceflight has contributed very, very little technology to earth.</i>&quot;<p>You need to keep a distinction in mind: manned vs unmanned.

To me, humans in space is mildly interesting, but the data from robotic missions to the outer planets and Mars as well as from the various space telescopes is nothing less than fascinating.<p>And when you start comparing the relative costs, it seems like a no brainer. For the budget required to sustain manned spaceflight in its relatively trivial form, you could launch a space telescope, two Mars missions, an outer-planet mission, a comet mission, an asteroid mission, and a Sun mission, all robotic, every year. There&#x27;d be a constant stream of new data of interest to scientists and the public. The inevitable failed missions would just be blips on the radar, and technical progress on the exploratory robots would go faster than ever.<p>Over the decades launch and return technology will improve, especially as private industry gets more involved in space travel, and once we have cheaper and more reliable ways to get into space, gradually it may make more and more sense for humans to return and live there (or it won&#x27;t, which is okay, too).",1391710372

The primary reason is that I do not believe that tablets should be first-class computing devices.  Tablets, and in my opinion, the entirety of what we today call &quot;mobile,&quot; should be subservient to a general computing model of personal omnipresent applications [1].  Put more concretely, I should only have one e-mail application, one web browser, one IM client, one media player, and all of my devices—wired, wireless, wifi, cellular, and everything in between—should be views upon those singular applications and nothing more.<p>So although I have three tablets because I am a technology addict, I simultaneously <i>do not</i> want them because I do not want additional first-class computing devices in my life.<p>If each additional tablet I purchased were just another input and output device—an additional view—added to my arsenal, I would buy as many as I see worthwhile to have scattered throughout my house and office.  But as it is, each additional tablet (or phone or computer) is a first-class device with first-class expectations for my attention.  Every device wants to be babied with application installations, updates, configuration, local data, and the works.  Today&#x27;s plain cloud is a meager, sticky, and altogether phony solution to this problem.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see this and an article about decentralizing the Internet (mischaracterized as &quot;the web&quot;) as the top two articles at HN presently.  I recently ranted [2] that Mr. Nadella should seize the opportunity to take Microsoft into a fundamentally different direction than what everyone is telling him, including himself (&quot;mobile first, cloud first&quot;), rather focusing on users and applications first.  Particular views of applications, such as mobile or desktop or living room, are <i>secondary</i> matters.<p>I&#x27;d like to see Microsoft step up and become the only tech titan to stop following today&#x27;s mobile-first, cloud-first model and swing the pendulum back to self-control with technology serving users, not companies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/microsoft-carve-your-path"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/microsoft-carve-your-path</a>",1391710232

I studied graphic design, played/made music as a hobby, and became passionate about coding (mostly self taught), so much that I tend to integrate code into everything I do, including in the design process. The idea for the game happened while coding, all the art in the game is procedural (except the wiggly lines in the center of the planets, that&#x27;s the only in-game texture), and the trailer is generated in one swoop by code (by automating the game engine and outputting every frame as a png file).<p>Eliss Infinity is a reboot of Eliss which was an early iPhone game (2009) which took me 5 months of work (+2 months to learn and build libraries in OpenGL and Objective-C). I polished it, made it more accessible, added a tutorial, added new modes, new music, a text-free interface... made it universal (there was only one resolution when Eliss came out), added Game Center, sync ... All this work took me more than twice the work I put into the original game.<p>Let me know if you have any questions.",1391709684

1237207,comment,1235671,1236867,0,0,johnohara,,,"The bus (a backplane really) was the system. And everything plugged into it.<p>Here's a picture of the original Altair:\n<a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Altair_8800_Computer.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Altair_88...</a><p>Everything you needed was on a separate card that plugged into the backplane. CPU, memory, controllers.<p>The IBM PC changed all that. The motherboard became the system. The amount of memory was limited because the number of surface mounts was limited. The number of devices was limited because you didn't have the expansion slots. There's room in the Altair's chassis for 10 cards -- in 1977!. But where the PC removed options, the weight of IBM created a standard which for better or worse is still with us today.<p>In the picture, the two cards in the middle look like internal RAM. The total amount is based upon the capacity of each chip. But there it is -- a memory array. With greater capacity than the computer found on Apollo. On the desktop. You could buy the boards and chips from Jameco or anybody else (they came in long plastic tubes) and carefully populate the board wearing static straps on your wrists. Need more memory, add another card. 8"" floppy drive? Add a controller. Tape drive? Add a controller. Console terminal? Add a controller. Upgrade the processor? Install a math co-processor.<p>The third party market for parts and devices was robust because the bus was standard and open.<p>The introduction of the IBM PC (model 5150) hit the S100 market hard. Ed Roberts knew the S100 architecture was more flexible and invited greater participation and innovation by inventors and hobbyists so you can see why he might take exception to Gates and Allen providing an operating system and programming language to its competition. But the arrival of the PC really meant the paradigm had shifted -- from hobbyists to business and Gates and Allen shifted with it.<p>For fun, let's look at the picture and try to guess at what's going on. There is a DB25 connector in the upper left corner. That's where the serial console plugged in. Usually a teletype device of some kind (like the devices in this picture: <a href=""http://www.netbsd.org/images/machines/vax/vax11-780.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netbsd.org/images/machines/vax/vax11-780.jpg</a>). Looks like the pinouts were hand soldered. It's what you did. The back panel has plenty of expansion for other DB25 connectors to support printers, other terminals (multi-user O/S) and more.<p>The power supply is attached to the back in the upper right. The power bus is immediately to its left. You'd recognize that as the white block on today's motherboards. Note the quality of the bearings on the fan and how it's wired. The thing moved air.<p>The device underneath the main chassis is an 8"" floppy drive. It's powered up, the disk is enabled (notched in the corner) but the heads look retracted (parked).<p>Note some of the switches in front. On/Off, reset and single step (to walk through each instruction). This is an 8 bit machine and each instruction is displayed in byte order (right to left). It looks like one set of lights displays the ""address"" (a0-a7) and the other displays the ""data"" value found at the address (d0-d7).<p>So we are currently in single step mode, at address location 10110110 (B6 hex) and it contains the value 11111111 (FF hex). Hit the single step switch again and let's debug the next instruction.",1270234515

1237185,comment,1236415,1237029,0,0,tsally,,,"This is a gross simplification.  Let's expand this discussion to public verses private. I'm going to talk about education instead of the USPS because I know more about education. Goal of a public education system: provide actual learning, understanding, and life-long skills to everyone.  Goal of a private education system: maximize profits by providing competitive diplomas as cheaply as possible.<p>See the issue?  The priority in the private system is on making profit and providing diplomas to people.  The priority in the public system is on actual learning.  The rampant grade inflation at Ivy League schools is a great example of learning taking a back seat in favor of producing graduates that look good on paper.<p>Don't make the mistake of thinking that ""public"" universities are any better.  At my university (UIUC), research grants account for the vast majority of the funding for the engineering college.  Consequently, research is the priority, not the education of the students.  Simply put, the priority is where the money is.  If the money is tied to the learning of the students, the students will actually learn.  If it's tied to producing diplomas or publications, that's where the priority will be placed.  UIUC can get away with it because its engineering graduates are still extremely highly paid.  The prestige of UIUC's faculty is responsible for that, but it would be erroneous to attribute it to the educational curriculum.  I can tell you from personal experience that the vast majority of graduates are average programmers at best and many haven't really internalized essential CS skills like algorithms, data structures, etc.  One example that really sticks out in my mind: I went to a talk by Alan Kay last semester.  Hardly any undergraduates attend, or even know or care who Alan Kay is.  Alan puts up a few slides with pictures of McCarthy, Sutherland, Church, etc.  Not a single undergraduate can name their primary contributions to the field.  No one even knew the importance of Lisp!  As Alan aptly put it, ""you all are lucky your field isn't Physics; if it were you would be kicked out of the department and sent back to high school for not knowing the fundamentals of past research"" (paraphrasing).<p>So why doesn't your grocery store example hold up?  The success of a grocery store is strongly coupled to the quality of its product.  Spoiled food is spoiled food.  Education?  Turns out the diploma, not learning, is what matters the most.  The USPS is a similar situation, true value of the service (essentially free communication for all citizens everywhere) is only loosely coupled with the financial success of the service.",1270234110

Why should I have to pay $99 just to sign my own apps for personal use? You don't pay the car manufacturer for a license to modify your car. This is the only problem I have with these devices.<p>In my opinion, Apple should just do what Windows does with downloads, and warn users when installing unsigned apps.

The iPad and iPhone are more closed, more hostile to tinkerers, more hostile to adventurous users, than most other similar devices. This is a <i>bad</i> thing. One shouldn't apologize for a company doing bad things, just because things in the industry as a whole are better than they were ten or fifteen or twenty years ago.<p>Open Source software has made dramatic improvements in the landscape for kids learning technology today. Apple is fighting those improvements, and they <i>should</i> be called out for that bad behavior. Apple is behaving in ways that are bad for developers, and bad for kids who might become hackers. Just because they also happen to build awesome products, and do happen to provide an approved relief valve for their closed ecosystem, doesn't make it OK to be hostile to developers and would-be hackers.",1270233296

And you had to, because many of those components required frequent maintenance. To properly own a car required, to some degree, that you understood how a car worked. Today, you open the hood of your car and you see a big sealed block and a basin for the windshield washer fluid. You can buy a new car, drive it for years, and never once open the hood yourself.""</i><p>(Warning, car guy!)  First, I don't think this is a bad thing.  The average person doesn't want to perform any maintenance anyways.  Heck, oil changes.  They're still just as easy to perform.  You're not even saving any time by going to the dealership and back, plus waiting around.  You're certainly not saving any money (I can save $45 changing my oil myself).  People just don't want to expend the effort.<p>In the case of cars, at least in the US, they went from an object to pride to... a nuisance for most motorists.  They want to be comforted, coddled, and have as much as possible done for them so they can chat with friends, sip their coffee, or have a conversation via text message.<p>That applies to many things.  I know plenty of folks who spend $10-12 a day on lunch.  $10-12 of ingredients gets me a <i>far</i> better lunch for the entire week.  Even saves me time, because I don't have to wait in a line every day.<p>It's not cheaper.  It's not even less time.  It's the time spent is ""lower impact"" I guess.  That's what's paid for.  Consumers are given a choice, and many choose the path of overall least resistance.  I'm sure there's plenty of other psychological factors at play (i.e., ""Well I have the money to not need to cook for myself all the time!"", advertising making things seem more appealing), but the reality is when presented with all the options, folks just want to do the least work possible.<p>Give people more iPads.  At least in the current consumer culture, it's exactly what people want.  They don't want to explore or program.  It's the path of computing least resistance.

He's protesting the very philosophy that gives Apple products the quality that people who buy Apple products desire.  And honestly, making the openness of Apple products your raison d'etre is a bit like getting furious about the mechanical details of your favorite brand of dishwasher.  The answer is always the same:  don't like it?  <i>Don't buy it</i>.<p>Cory is more than welcome to continue to post these sorts of rants on his blog, of course, but let's not turn them into more than what they are:  one guy, forcefully advocating an opinion about something that really doesn't matter that much to most people, and that he can't really change.",1270231468

If you talk to 100k people who talk to 10 people each, do you get more bang than talking to one person who has 1m followers?""<p>And I'd say the answer is emphatically yes. I'm far more likely to listen to the opinions of friends and family (especially knowledgeable ones) than a celebrity whose celebrity is derived solely from being a celebrity.<p>I've actually been building a product over the last month that taps into these sort of long-tail recommendations, which I hope to launch as soon as this weekend. We'll see if it proves more valuable to its users than a $10,000 tweet from Kim Kardashian, but I'd be shocked if the answer wasn't ""yes.""",1270231465

Obviously, not everyone will feel that way.<p>People generally don't buy products because they're perfect. They buy them because the good things outweigh a few blemishes.<p>There is no doubt the iPad will be a better product a year from now.

J. Crew were the most damnably aggressive spammers...after repeated attempts to opt out, they were still sending me two catalogs a week. I'll never make the mistake of buying someone a gift from J. Crew again.<p>Anyway, I needed a mail forwarding service, anyway, since moving into an RV, but this turned out to be an awesome bonus and I wish I'd set it up years ago. I will never be without a mail forwarding service again...for less than $20/month it's just too convenient to have someone else sort and scan my mail, and get rid of the garbage.",1270231384

If you look at it like a consumer appliance (just like the iPod Touch, iPhone, Kindle, Nook, etc.) then the iPad isn't really any different in is approach than any other appliance.<p>The iPad doesn't strike me as a device for any sort of creative type (producing code, documents, photographs, etc). Instead, it is a device for media consumption, just like a television or set-top box. People who want to create things will buy a PC. Just like having a PC connected to a television is useful, having an iPad that syncs with a PC might be useful to some.<p>In short, the greatest danger here is letting people think of the iPad as a replacement for the personal computer.

In America, there are numerous ways still to discharge your sins of a previously extravagent lifestyle funded on credit card.  You can declare bankruptcy (the article mentions the high cost of $2000+, but there are free social services that will help reduce that cost).  You can refuse payment for many years, eventually settling to pay off 10-20 cents on the dollar for debt.  You can choose to work in jobs getting paid in cash, thereby having no records of salary, and pay no taxes, and eventually your debt is discharged.

Among the areas predicted to have severe and permanent drought is the southeastern USA.<p>Furthermore we are learning about new risks.  For instance ocean acidification has put us on a possibly irreversible path towards world-wide mass extinctions of organisms that use calcium carbonate for protection.  This includes coral and shellfish.  Nobody knows what resulting ecosystem changes will happen, or what the consequences for commercial fisheries which are a critical food supply for populations around the world.<p>The only way in which these things do not qualify as ""catastrophic"" is in comparison to worse catastrophes that were within the realm of theoretical possibility, but which now seem less likely.

It was referring to a gap like that between developing web applications in Ruby or Python. Drop a Django guy into a Rails project or vice versa and they will hit productivity parity within a very short span of time.<p>The problem that the post laments is that while there absolutely are separate domains within the programming field, HR people rarely have any idea what those domains actually are. Because of this, they tend to operate under the assumption that every single entity (language, framework, etc) is a different domain, and if you haven't worked with the right entity then you don't have enough experience.<p>Edit: To expand on this a bit further, your example of systems programming vs. web development is actually a perfect example of what the <i>right</i> question would be for the interviewer to ask. Has the carpenter built a lot of houses, or have they built a lot of tables and chairs? What wood they used to build them doesn't matter much, but what they built with it is very important and is where the real domain gaps actually lie.

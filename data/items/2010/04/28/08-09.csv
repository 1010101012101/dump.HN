I don't like mutable state, therefore I don't like OO as defined above.<p>We can also define OO as the use of inheritance. The problem with inheritance is that it spurs the violation of decoupling. More often than not, derived classes are tightly coupled to their base class. I don't like that. This paper also suggest that inheritance is not very good, because it would increase the error rate by 6: <a href=""http://www.leshatton.org/Documents/OO_IS698.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leshatton.org/Documents/OO_IS698.pdf</a> (Note that I don't take this paper as a proof that OO is bad in general. Rather, it strongly suggest that C++ without templates nor the STL, used in an OO fashion, is worse than plain C).<p>Now, if you forbid (or severely limit) both mutable state and inheritance, I really don't see what is left to OO. We could see you `Animal` data type and the Ocaml module system as forms of OO, but at this point, ""OO"" would mean anything (and therefore be meaningless).<p>(Note: when I say ""I don't like X"", I mean I will avoid X as long as the resulting solution isn't demonstrably simpler.)",1272444411

Avoid custom themes and colors, but 80% of the developers believe a custom theme is better. This in general doesn't make software ugly, but when you don't have (or don't want to have) the resources for a good graphics design team to do the entire design of the app, it leaves choices on the hands of programmers (not the best designers imo). Comparing to Cocoa/Mac, usually programmers use less of custom themes and go with the Cocoa flow, making the applications slightly more elegant (as they are using the resources of the Mac Design team).<p>But this is in no way 100% true for both platforms, there are really horrible designed apps for Mac, and gorgeous applications for Windows, just what I feel to be the general trend.<p>Edit: I like ToDoList: <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/applications/todolist2.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/applications/todolist2.aspx</a>\nIt is as you say, a bit bloated, but works fine for keeping track of my programming tasks (it isn't GTD, just a hierarchal ToDo list, and open source)",1272444017

Much less a single point of failure that's a government-created oligopoly? Yikes.<p>It seems that businesses are just running on an outdated model developed when information sharing was a lot harder, so only condensed forms like quarterly reports and press releases were feasible. But now that information sharing is a lot easier, shareholders should be demanding more openness from businesses -- yes, today a lot of that information is considered to be a trade secret, but at the same time shareholders need to stop allowing businesses to get away with what's equivalent to deceit through ""creative"" accounting (e.g. apportioning profits/debts amongst subsidiaries). That's just a textbook example of exploiting information asymmetry. Shareholders should expect more information about the business' books and transactions. There must be some natural equilibrium between being open about transactions and protecting strategic advantages, but right now we have the functional equivalent to price fixing, er, information fixing -- companies don't release relevant information because ""no other company does"" and shareholders don't expect real operating information either because that's not part of the status quo.<p>Wouldn't an investment bank that was so confident in the principles behind its analysis that it was willing to list all its transactions in a continuously-updated XML file, despite the risk of copy-cats, seem like a pretty damn good investment? They wouldn't have to divulge their proprietary methods of analysis, just make their holdings public. This would greatly improve the efficiency of markets as investors could use their own proprietary methods to estimate the risk of an entity's portfolio management strategy when deciding whether to invest in it.<p>And there's definitely historical precedent for this -- the fabled value investor Benjamin Graham didn't go to great lengths to hide his trades, instead he'd use them as examples in his classes, and yeah, people copied him.

1301038,comment,1300882,1300967,0,0,btilly,,,"The problem with that is that the ratings are a public good.  Public goods have some counter-intuitive properties.  Investors would have every incentive to individually contribute as little to the pool as possible as long as action happened.  Economic theory says that one of four things is likely to happen.  Those are:<p>1. The knowledge is worthwhile to a small group (often just one) of investors, who fund it.  The memorable phrase for this is ""the exploitation of the large by the small.""  (A practical example of this is OPEC and high oil prices.  The complicated negotiations OPEC engages in illustrate the desire of members of the group to contribute as little as possible to provisioning the public good.)<p>2. An organization exists that investors belong to for some other reason which funds the ratings.  (A practical example of this how people belong to AAA for membership benefits, but then AAA lobbies for road improvements.)<p>3. A coercive organization intervenes and forces the matter.  (Virtually all government regulations fall into this category.)<p>4. The public good is not provisioned.  (What happened to investors who wanted trustworthy ratings.)<p>Read <i>The Logic of Collective Action</i> for the classic introduction to this topic.",1272442272

He came across as pragmatic and opinionated. In his writings and presentations he always stresses simplicity and efficiency (two virtues often lost in the quest for novelty and elegance), and he conspicuously disdains excess. Check out his 2008 DrupalCon presentation and you will see that he is a straight shooter who does not curry favor or spare the ignorant.",1272441924

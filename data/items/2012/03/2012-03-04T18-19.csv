3663530,comment,3663197,3663485,13,0,jsnell,,,"The ""attack"" clearly wasn't malicious, though probably immature. A malicious attacker would have been doing things like gaining access to users' private repos and stealing the code, or trying to sneak in harmful commits to a repo under a false name. This was at most a prank or a demonstration. So why this instead of responsible disclosure?<p>The problem is that it was not really a GitHub issue, it's Rails having a grossly insecure default setting. According to one of the comments in the bug tracker a lot of other high-profile sites also have the same problem. And presumably new ones would keep popping up for as long as Rails is the new hotness.<p>So disclosing the problem to GitHub would not solve anything. They'd deploy the fix, but a lot of other sites remain vulnerable. That's probably the case even if GitHub were willing to take a PR hit and admit they'd been insecure for a long time in order to spur other Rails users to fix their code. After all, they hadn't fixed their code after the previous widely published security problems caused by the same underlying issue.<p>Clearly the Rails core team were not willing to consider any kind of changes to improve the situation. As such, you can argue that making as big a scene as possible is the best way to improve security globally. It's of course unfortunate for GitHub that he chose to use that site as the example due to the obvious reasons. And certainly the timing is about as unfriendly as possible from the point of view of a west coast person.",1330887412

  awards -- the famous McDonald's hot-coffee case -- campaigns for limiting
  damage awards threaten to jeopardize the American right to civil jury
  trials guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. Investigative reporter Mencimer
  examines the Republican campaigns for tort reform that would protect
  large corporations from ""frivolous lawsuits."" The campaigns carry the
  dual benefit of supporting the interests of corporations that are major
  Republican campaign contributors and hurting trial lawyers, who are part
  of the contribution base of Democrats. Mencimer criticizes the media for
  their lack of understanding about civil litigation, willingness to
  swallow reports of litigation abuses, and failure to understand that
  Republican tort reform will also limit the ability of news organizations
  to sue for information. Drawing on national data and scrutiny of
  individual cases, Mencimer defends the civil justice system and its
  reliance on jurors, average citizens who are the same people who vote.
  This is an eye-opening look at an important issue for readers concerned
  with the civil justice system.

also, <i>""The Lawyer Myth: A Defense of the American Legal Profession""</i>[2]<p>From the Booklist review:<p><pre><code>  However disliked lawyers have become, they have played an essential role
  in the development of the American democracy, assert legal scholars
  Strickland and Read. Taking aim at media critics -- left and right -- who
  blame lawyers for a host of social ills, Strickland and Read debunk
  several popular myths about lawyers. They begin with the notion that
  there are too many lawyers and lawsuits, citing statistics to put things
  into perspective, and they point to the benefits that have come from
  lawsuits, including increased consumer protection from faulty products.
  But they concede the need for reform in a chapter that calls for major
  research into alternative legal mechanisms. Finally, Strickland and Read
  look toward the next generation of lawyers and outline the
  characteristics most essential for the practice of law: competency,
  responsiveness, and integrity. They emphasize that its not what lawyers
  bring to the law but what they give that makes a difference. This book
  is not likely to stop lawyer jokes, but it is an insightful look at a
  much-maligned profession.

Why should a major in English literature be subsidized with room and board on a beautiful campus with Olympic-size swimming pools and state-of-the-art athletic facilities when apprentices in nursing, electrical work, and new high-tech fields like mechatronics are typically unsubsidized (or less subsidized)? College students even get discounts at the movie theater; when was the last time you saw a discount for an electrical apprentice?""<p>That's a really good question. Back when I pursued my undergraduate degree (majoring in a modern foreign language), the state university's budget and sources of revenue were such that students paid about one-third of the cost of their educations through tuition payments. (That percentage has since increased for undergraduates at my alma mater, and of course this leaves aside the issue of who is subsidizing the students' tuition payments.) State appropriations funded by all taxpayers in my state paid for about another third of the university's undergraduate education expenses. (This percentage has decreased since I graduated.) Federal and private grants and all other sources of university income paid for the other third. (The university has since become better at private fund-raising--I get fund-raising telephone calls all the time as an alumnus--and a little better at licensing inventions and the like, but I think has a lower percentage of direct federal grants than it did when I was a student.) If a college education returns economic benefits to a student, and that is the usual claim, why doesn't the student just time-shift those economic returns by attending college with student loans? What is the rationale for public subsidies for university studies, and does that rationale suggest that other forms of studying should also be subsidized? Does that rationale suggest that different college major subjects ought to be subsidized at different levels of subsidy?",1330886556

Mini Coopers are another make with a ton of built-in computers. However, every time I do a search on reliability I find people talking casually about gigantic maintenance costs. I saw a used 1999 Mercedes SUV for $5K, googled it, and saw reviews where people were spending $4000 per year to maintain it -- and that was back in 1999 when it was new! Why spend $4000 yearly to maintain a $5000 vehicle? Might as well just buy a new one every year.<p>Similarly, you can usually pick up a Porsche Boxster for only around $10K once they hit the 50K miles mark, because Porsche recommends an expensive scheduled servicing at the 60K miles mark. I think it's about $12K. (In actuality the car doesn't need all the things they do in that service, just some subset.)<p>But still. It just offends me as an engineer that ""better"" cars have higher maintenance costs. If Mercedes is so much better at making cars than Honda, why can't it make cars that don't break? Honda makes cars that don't break. Why is the ""best"" car company out there unable to solve a technical problem that the ""crappy"" company solved twenty years ago?<p>Not trying to troll the Merc fanboys, it just gets my goat. I had basically given up on ever owning a nice car, because of sheer nerdrage, but I found out Honda's S2000 has a fantastic reputation for reliability. So that's my plan.<p>Please excuse the threadjack.",1330886471

3663472,comment,3663175,3663175,46,0,saurik,,,"The physical form factor here described is ""convertible slate"". However, as someone who has spent a lot of their computer time using convertible slates (starting with a Compaq Concerto and a pre-release Dauphin DTR-1 back in 1992: yes, I was using ""Windows 3.1 for Pen""), I will point out that with all of the circuitry in the slate the keyboard has to end up irritatingly poorly/awkwardly weighted (as it is way too light to make holding up the screen make sense) and is also bothersome to bring you (its ""yet another fidgety component"").<p>So, I then look at my 11"" MacBook Air, and frankly: the dimensions are almost the same as the original iPad. It is /slightly/ wider (due to the constraints of having a full-size physical keyboard with keys that recess and also various ports such as USB that require a certain amount of clearance inside of the device, which is already so thin that these ports barely can exist in the device at all), but if USB is supplanted by something like Apple's Thunderbolt (convenient, huh), they could make it slightly narrower and slightly thinner.<p>I then argue what you're really going to end up with is a device more like the NEC Versa (1995-ish) or ThinkPad X61 (more devices I've owned), where the screen rotates around and folds back down backwards. This way, you always have the keyboard with you, and it can ""take the load off"" the screen part by having real circuitry in it (thereby giving it enough heft to balance the screen easily), which in turn allows the combined size to be smaller (as otherwise you are having to artificially increase the heft of the keyboard).<p>Apple, in fact, has been looking at such designs. We see patents from them for various ways of building a convertible slate for a while now. The original design had the screen hinged along the edge of the keyboard, where it could kind of slide down the case towards the end, and then fold back (away from you, as opposed to towards you) onto the keyboard, turning into a slate (which has the property that the screen's orientation doesn't change during the operation), but in 2011 we see the more traditional ""rotate"".<p><a href=""http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2008/07/apple-reveals-secret-notebook-tablet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2008/07/apple-re...</a><p><a href=""http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2011/11/apple-wins-patent-for-telephonic-macbook-with-rotatable-display.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2011/11/apple-wi...</a><p>The 2011 design also makes it clear that this device could have a cellular modem in it, which means that were it to exist it would compete with a 3G iPad. That brings us to the listed constraint of ""run apps written for iOS"". Truly, however: much like you don't actually want a case that can house a keyboard and attach it to an iPad, you also don't want to be able to run iOS applications; the mistake in both is to take what you have now, assume ""I can't have it both ways"", and then come up with some kind of band-aid solution.<p>What you really want is to have a single set of applications that work well on either form factor due to a set of unified interface primitives. When you ""convert"" between a laptop and a slate, you don't want to be running a different web browser and a different word processor: you want there to be a seamless set of rather subtle changes to the apps you were just running (if any changes are required at all: in an ideal world you would want no changes, but there are practical concerns), allowing you to maintain mental state.<p>Again, this is the direction Apple is headed. In Lion they have started moving desktop Mac OS X to a world of full-screen applications, just like on iOS, and are borrowing many of the UI elements. They reversed the scrolling direction (to make the gestures common) and removed the scrollbars (which already aren't present on iOS for various reasons). Gestures are now permeating more of the applications, and with just another couple years of this, the difference is going to be quite slight; and yes: they have another patent on it.<p><a href=""http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2010/11/apple-wins-multiple-touch-macbook-tablet-patents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2010/11/apple-wi...</a><p>Really, the only thing left would be to figure out how to unify the App Store experience. Ideally (for Apple), the resulting ecosystem would be quite similar to the situation on iOS: a closed store that Apple controls, with careful ""security"" measures at all levels to keep the user from ""messing up"" their device with software that wasn't centrally vetted. This would be accomplished with a combination of protected firmware and sandboxing of all applications, each of which would be isolated to their own state.<p>Well, with the advent of the Mac App Store we see Apple offering the same unified experience, and with Lion we saw them adding sandboxes. These sandboxes eventually became a required part of the workflow, and with Mountain Lion they are getting tighter. Meanwhile, Mountain Lion has added the ""only from App Store"" switch: defaulted to off (for now), but with another half-way setting, ""only from registered developer"" defaulted to on; even I felt this was ahead of schedule ;P. Again: we only need to look forward another couple years.<p>tl;dr I believe Apple's behaviors (and patents) agree: their goal is to provide this.",1330886420

Without specifying attr_accessible it would mean that if a malicious user added params[:post][:user_id] to their POST/PUT, the Rails application would update the user_id as per the params value. If attr_accessible had been called, defining the columns that the developer wanted to be mass assigned (say post and title), it would mean that the user_id would not be mass assigned and Rails would log that this was the case.<p>attr_accessible therefore acts as a whitelist for columns that can be mass assigned. It just so happens that the Rails default is to have no whitelist and allow all columns to be mass assigned, despite the fact that the sensible option is to <i>always</i> have a call to attr_accessible in your models.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5228"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5228</a>",1330884063

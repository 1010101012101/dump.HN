As I recall, the essay ends with him noting that a household servant he&#x27;d dismissed some years before (pursuing a &quot;flim&quot; career) had since returned, to the pleasure of both parties.<p>Sadly I can&#x27;t find a copy online -- seems that at a $1.78 purchase price the friction of commerce is excessive here for a 50 year old essay.",1391842457

They don&#x27;t need auto-specific coverage since driving is incidental to the primary business (food prep/sales) rather than the point of the business.  In some states, the companies are required to take out additional insurance to cover their delivery drivers, but the policies aren&#x27;t driver-specific.  Either way, the driver is covered by the company, <i>which is how it should be.</i>  (Auto insurance policies don&#x27;t prohibit food delivery employment--only package delivery and passenger transport, as those raise very different liability issues.)<p>Uber&#x27;s business is connecting drivers to passengers, and it takes a commission for doing so that is in some cases equal to or greater than what taxi companies collect for roughly the same service.  The difference is that taxi companies are required to have insurance, and Uber arbitrages insurance costs and books it as &quot;revenue.&quot;",1391842212

7200526,comment,7196576,7197217,3,0,fricken4,,,"While the regulations were at one time created to keep shady players out of the industry, Taxi services nowdays are most certainly regulated for the sake of limiting competition. Consider that in Manhattan in the 1950s there were roughly 13,000 taxi medallions. Today there are still only 13,000 medallions available- they sell at auction for a million dollars a piece.<p>The Taxi companies that own these medallions have gone to court many times to enforce the artificial scarcity that drives up the value of their golden geese.<p>A taxi driver in NYC has to pay $80,000 a year over and above his insurance and operating costs just for the right to operate a cab: that money goes straight into the pockets of medallion owners who don&#x27;t much of anything except own medallions- until a threat like Uber comes along,  wherein it&#x27;s time to deliver brown paper bags filled with bundles of unmarked bills until the problem is solved. Both the drivers and the consumers are getting shafted.<p>NY is an extreme example, but the taxi industry works more or less same way in pretty much every city in the western world. It&#x27;s not uncommon for incumbent businesses to hijack goodwill regulations as a way to stifle legitimate competition.<p>Now Uber and app-based livery services do need to be regulated- but their service is a whole different paradigm from the traditional taxi industry. In California progressive legislation has been passed that places these services in a completely different category than tradition taxi companies, much to the dismay of those taxi companies.<p>Uber is also expanding aggressively- their revenue has grown 20% per month over the past couple years, they started with 15 cars in 2009 and they are now valued at nearly 4 billion dollars, and operate in 60 countries. Every city they go into, they go into expecting a fight. They win some and they lose some. They were shut down in both Toronto and Vancouver. Uber is a fascinating company to watch- it&#x27;s trench warfare everywhere they go- and they have mountains of venture capital backing them.",1391841889
7200525,comment,7200280,7200280,3,0,msandford,,,"I REALLY hate to agree with a creationist to any degree but there is something to the observational/historical debate.<p>We now understand a LOT of physics and chemistry.  That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s observational, and because it&#x27;s observational you can make predictions, perform experiments and get results.  Other people can do the same as well, thus enabling not only peer review but actual verifiability.<p>This is why we understand physics and chemistry extremely well, biology OK but rapidly improving, and economics and public policy much less well.  Because we can reproduce results in physics everyone either agrees on the truth or is generally regarded as a crackpot.  Biologists can&#x27;t produce the kinds of extremely clean data physicists can but it&#x27;s still meaningful.  In macroeconomics there&#x27;s very little ability to perform experiments in a repeatable fashion, which results in everyone observing the world and then arguing about why things happened and nobody can prove that they&#x27;re right or that others are wrong.<p>When you&#x27;re dealing with math or computer science induction is a great tool that allows you to do pretty incredible things.  But it does so because the nature of math or algorithms is stationary; the rules are 100% fixed from the beginning of time &#x27;til the end (or so you can assume if you&#x27;re building the system) and thus any assumptions are by definition correct.  It&#x27;s much harder to do this when you&#x27;re dealing with things that can change over time (and thus potentially invalidate your assumptions), which is basically everything else.  That&#x27;s not to say that induction is worthless outside of math and computer science but it&#x27;s use comes with more caveats.<p>I totally get why serious scientists don&#x27;t want to even acknowledge that a creationist might raise a good point but once it&#x27;s made the damage is done.  If you don&#x27;t respond at all they pile on saying &quot;look he doesn&#x27;t have an answer for X!&quot; and if you do respond with a reasonable statement about &quot;this is the best we know thus far and of course nothing can be known until we observe it directly&quot; then they&#x27;ll pile on with &quot;see it&#x27;s not guaranteed!&quot;  Both of those outcomes are extremely frustrating when you&#x27;re dealing with someone who can&#x27;t be convinced with any amount of evidence.<p>But failing to acknowledge that there is a difference between direct observation and historical/induction and that they create two classes of certainty which are not identical does the very tedious and difficult work of science a disservice in my opinion.<p>EDIT: To clarify I think what I&#x27;m mostly talking about is certainty.  If you can&#x27;t directly (or indirectly) observe something happening with some kind of experiment you can have a personal opinion about certainty and someone else can have another but neither one can be provably wrong.  Once that happens there&#x27;s real certainty and very little room for opinion anymore.  Until then things are a bit more fluid.  A well educated person&#x27;s estimate of certainty might be much more accurate than a plebe&#x27;s but it&#x27;s not guaranteed to be right.",1391841888

People are either raging fundamentalists who take the Bible as literal truth and reject all science that contradicts it, or they are reasonable people who think the Earth is old and evolution happened.<p>In reality, there are a ton of creationists who aren&#x27;t raging fundamentalists. They aren&#x27;t creationists because they believe so fervently that they cannot accept any contrary evidence. They&#x27;re simply creationists because <i>that&#x27;s all they know</i>. Many of these people, when exposed to the truth in a constructive way, will change their minds.<p>In fact, I was one of those people.

Later on I found out about the scientific explanations, and came to accept them instead.<p>You&#x27;ll never convince Ken Ham. Nor will you convince his hardcore supporters. That&#x27;s not the point. The point is to reach out to people who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> hardcore about it, but who still believe nonsense simply because they don&#x27;t know any better.

Nonetheless, the two still somehow found a way to &quot;argue&quot; and &quot;debate&quot; for two hours.<p>Nye should have had it easy.  He could have argued that creationists need to demonstrate why their beliefs are any more true than the hundreds of other contradictory creation myths that come from various world cultures (as salgernon mentioned).  He also could have argued that science and creationism are not fundamentally incompatible, but instead sort of orthogonal.  Creationism can be thought of as a cosmological hypothesis.  It happens to be a hypothesis that is basically impossible to test, so scientists instead spend their time evaluating other hypothesis.<p>Instead, it sounded like he argued the position that &quot;science helps us learn and do cool things, plus you don&#x27;t need to believe in God to seek answers to life&#x27;s important question.&quot;   Weak position.  Counter argument: &quot;I don&#x27;t care about learning or technology because when I die I am going to heaven, and that&#x27;s ultimately more important than science.&quot;",1391840708

Hell, I&#x27;d pay $5/month for, say, 20 GB. Realistically, I&#x27;d rarely use more than 10 GB.<p>It&#x27;s the same story on the business side. My small team of eight would love to use Dropbox but, again, it&#x27;s not a huge amount of storage that we need -- 10 GB would likely be more than we&#x27;d ever use. Instead, it&#x27;s the ease with which we can all share that 10 GB of files that I&#x27;d happily pay for.<p>That 10 GB of storage would cost us $120/mo. (it could be as low as $80/month, but we could/would use those extra features so I&#x27;d go for the higher level).<p>Granted, $120/month isn&#x27;t a lot and it would be much easier to justify if we were going to come close to using the whole 100 GB of storage. Since we effectively need to be able to easily share the contents of a small USB flash drive, though, $120/mo. seems a little outrageous.<p>At the very least, it seems that &quot;per-user&quot; isn&#x27;t the best option in all cases and that other methods of charging would be a better fit. For example, there are a few non-technical people in our office that we might consider adding. They would rarely need access to any of the files we&#x27;d store on Dropbox but it might be nice to have them as users &quot;just in case&quot; -- but not for $15/user/month.<p>In our case, Dropbox would quickly gain us as a customer if we could instead pay based upon the amount of storage we use (it seems ironic that this isn&#x27;t an option, considering storage is likely one of their highest costs). We would, for example, sign up today if there was a &quot;$1/GB/month regardless of number of users&quot; option.<p>As an added bonus, our daily use of Dropbox would likely result in us recommending it to many of our customers who would also sign up (if they could also pay based upon storage and not the number of users).",1391840414

Instead of explaining religion from a scientific point of view, they instead debate nonsense as if it is on equal footing with empirically validated science. Richard Dawkins, who taught me biology through his incredible books, has wasted a majority of his life following this foolish path. I still don&#x27;t understand why.<p>Religious beliefs result in adaptive behaviors proven to increase fitness in certain environments. That is, these behaviors enhance the fitness of the genes which make one predisposed to religiosity. This has been hypothesized many times, and is the only rational explanation for the vast and fervent religious behaviors we witness today. In brief, religious behaviors cause individuals to engage in cooperative exchanges which are mutually beneficial to both parties. Iterated over many interactions, in a large population, with reputation, it becomes obvious that these behaviors are adaptive.<p>What biologists must emphasize is that religious behaviors are distinct from religious mythology. It is the behaviors we are interested in as scientists, not the literary masterpieces that constitute such works as the Bible, Quran, Torah, etc. Although they are linked, from an empirical point of view it is meaningless to analyze the philosophy of religion. We must instead look at the behaviors and their resultant consequences.<p>For those interested, there is a massive amount of knowledge on this subject. I would recommend beginning with Richard Dawkins&#x27; Selfish Gene, and intuitively working through the corollaries thereafter.

Instead of capital gain a capital loss may happen - for example when you own stock, like, in particular, after exercise. Whereis in case of stock options there is no risk of loss before exercise. The stock options may be worth 0 - that is the lowest possible outcome, and you wouldn&#x27;t be charged a dime if the options are underwater. Just like bonus - company pays to you when things are great, yet you don&#x27;t pay to company when the things aren&#x27;t. Thus the same ordinary income tax treatment for stock options exercise profit as for bonus.",1391839448

7200430,comment,7200043,7200043,11,0,chrissnell,,,"A couple of things that I&#x27;d like to see in this script:<p>1. Go ahead and apply all of the software updates.  The RAX Ubuntu images are behind on a lot of security updates.<p><pre><code>   apt-get -q upgrade\n   apt-get -q dist-upgrade\n   reboot (at the end)\n\n</code></pre>\n2.  While you&#x27;re at it, enable automatic security-related upgrades.  It&#x27;s likely that the user of your service is less technical and not Linux-saavy.  Let&#x27;s keep their cloud server from being owned.<p>3.  Force public key auth (disable password auth) on their OpenSSH server and (preferably) disable root logins entirely.  Create a user account for them if needed, with sudo access.<p>4.  Set up IPtables as default-deny with holes punched for OpenVPN and OpenSSH.<p>5.  Configure OpenSSH to listen on port 443 in addition to 22.  Some hotspots block port 22.  Almost nobody blocks port 443/tcp.  This is super-handy if you&#x27;re ever working from some place with a restrictive or filtering firewall.   SOCKS over SSH is awesome, especially when you&#x27;re dealing with censorship or malevolence at the DNS level.  I used this technique when I was in the Army and our Army housing had horrible DNS servers that censored a lot of legitimate sites.<p>6. I would prefer you not ask for people&#x27;s cloud provider API keys.  This has huge potential for abuse.   Instead, give them a script that they can run on any Mac or Linux box that takes the root password and IP and provisions their server for them.<p>I suppose I should make a PR for you; maybe later this weekend",1391839375

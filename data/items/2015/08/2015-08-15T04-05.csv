CHERI&#x27;s path included legacy compatibility with FreeBSD software (CheriBSD) building on capability model like EROS did. SAFE essentially types memory with functional programming and verification. Personally, I thought they should&#x27;ve just ported Oberon to it for something immediately usable. One thing about SAFE, along with predecessor TIARA, is they go for &quot;zero-kernel&quot; OS where everything is deprivileged where possible with hardware enforcement and elimination of context switches.<p>However, I think their program transformation or microkernels with capabilities are best we can do for traditional architectures (esp x86) with kernel/user mode protections. Hypervisor layer adds additional possibilities but it&#x27;s still simple, powerful things looking after complicated, weak things. Same stuff with new abstraction and efficiency opportunities. Clean-slate is best investment, though, so we should keep putting money into and building on architectures such as CHERI and SAFE.",1439614688

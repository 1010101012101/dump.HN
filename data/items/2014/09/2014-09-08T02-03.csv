I used to subscribe to an ADSL service starting about a decade ago through a local ISP, but I was required to lease the copper connection through Qwest which was acquired by CenturyLink. I could always tell when someone new moved into the neighborhood and signed up with CenturyLink because the technician would always climb up the pole and disconnect me in order to hook up their line. That&#x27;s not to say that my speeds weren&#x27;t great (was paying for 7/1, which is what I received), but the cost on the leased line was extraordinary. By the time I canceled the monthly bill for a dead phone line to my ISP climbed from about $25 to $60, still for 7/1 service.<p>I only switched to Comcast at home last year because it was 2013 and 1Mbit upload speeds for the price I was paying was ridiculous. At least with Comcast I know how to play the &quot;the cost is too high, do you have any special offers this month?&quot; game.

8283223,comment,8282124,8282545,19,0,otakucode,,,"To use strokes so broad that any historian would like to harm me... what happened was basically that the Islamic world came up against the Crusades, and with Catholics murdering them with terrible savagery, they decided to seal themselves off from the world.  And in that seclusion they missed out on the most important development in human history - The Enlightenment.  Possible the greatest achievement of The Enlightenment was driving a wedge between religion belief and beliefs about the material world.  Prior to The Enlightenment, these two things were the same thing - a concept which is VERY difficult for people from post-Enlightenment cultures to understand.  Seeing gravity as an expression of a gods will?  Thinking it sensible to look for religious explanations to solve mechanical problems?  No belief in an afterlife, but belief that the material world was a thing skin over the supernatural world which actually controlled everything?  These things just don&#x27;t make sense to post-Enlightenment folks.<p>Those ideas are absolutely and totally required to support the idea of coexistence of peoples of different faiths.  Otherwise, religious ideas about eternity and salvation trump any concerns.  There is nothing which can outweigh the importance of eternity.  And in their isolation, concerns for eternity (and self preservation) consumed the Islamic world.  The division between modern &#x27;moderate&#x27; Islamists and &#x27;fundamentalist&#x27; Islamists is this exact divide solved by The Enlightenment.<p>And the outcome is by no means a foregone conclusion.  People are going to have to choose to believe that their religious beliefs are &quot;just religious&quot; and have no serious relevance to the material world (the exact notion their religion decries as the ultimate heresy) and join the modern world... or cling to their pre-Enlightenment system and be exterminated through violence by the rest of the world.  Coexistence with pre-Enlightenment people in a world where technology gives individuals so much power of different kinds simply is not possible.",1410144474

8283169,comment,8282124,8283029,3,0,nraf,,,"My point isn&#x27;t that there are many non-Muslim Arab scholars, it&#x27;s that a lot of the greatest Muslim scholars at the time weren&#x27;t actually of Arab origin. e.g. Ibn Sina and Al-Ghazali were both of Persian origin (although the lingua franca was Arabic).<p>Islam was the catalyst of change in the 7th century, I don&#x27;t see how that could be denied. Yes, it was predominately Arabs that brought it outside the Peninsula but the scholarly achievements weren&#x27;t Arab achievements, because, again, many of the scholars weren&#x27;t Arabs. Heck, the most important book in Sunni Islam after the Qur&#x27;an was compiled by al-Bukhari, a non-Arab from Bukhara in modern-day Afghanistan.<p>If you look into it, Islamic scholarship didn&#x27;t really kick off until the Abbasid Dynasty was established. Non-Arabs played a large role in allowing the Abbasids to come into power in the first place.<p>The jizya (tax on non-Muslims) was a higher fee than the zakat (religious tax on Muslims). As more and more non-Arabs started to embrace Islam, the Umayyads were getting less and less tax revenue because the new Muslims were playing zakat instead of jizya.<p>As such, they stated (against the laws of Islam) that non-Arab converts to Islam still need to pay the same amount as they were paying before they embraced Islam. Naturally, this led to a lot of resentment amongst the new non-Arab Muslims who would later support the Abbasid rebellion against the Umayyads.<p>The Abbasids would go on to employ many non-Arabs, especially Persians, into high positions in government.",1410142974

He says that there&#x27;s no way a public IP would show up at layers 3 or 4 of the OSI model. The author takes the position that the IP leak must have come from layer 7 (quoting from the article):<p><i>[...] and it is at the application layer that the FBI uncovered the IP address.</i><p>Depending on how one interprets the FBI&#x27;s wording, this impossibility contradicts their accounting of how they discovered the IP. Let&#x27;s look at what the FBI said:<p><i>Upon examining the individual packets of data being sent back from the website,3 [sic] we noticed that the headers of some of the packets reflected a certain IP address not associated with any known Tor node as the source of the packets.</i><p>Note that they&#x27;re talking about headers <i>of the packets</i>, not <i>HTTP</i> headers. This is the FBI, though, so it&#x27;s possible they confused &quot;packets&quot; with &quot;HTTP requests&quot;. Taking their words at face value, though, the FBI seem to say that they got the IP address from the IP headers on packets received from Silk Road, or at least traffic generated by their browser on behalf of Silk Road. That&#x27;s what the author argues is impossible.<p>Nobody, least of all the author, disputes that Silk Road could have leaked its IP in HTTP headers, or via some other misconfiguration. But if they did, why didn&#x27;t the FBI just say that? Why claim that they leaked it in the IP layer?<p>Two possibilities come to mind. The first is that the FBI got the IP from the application layer, as everyone believes is possible, and misattributed the leak to the IP layer due to terminology confusion. The second is that they got the IP from another source, attempted to deceptively misattribute the source, and accidentally picked a fake source the leak could not have come from. If the second option is the case, we&#x27;re looking at an example of parallel construction.<p>Edit: Grammar. Gotta keep up appearances.",1410142398

If I can write to a directory in your PATH that gets searched before the location of your desired gpg binary, then I win.  Depending on your PATH, I don&#x27;t need privileges or even a user account--for example, using a browser exploit or some social engineering, I could drop a poisoned gpg into your Downloads directory (or anywhere in your /home or /tmp), and if your PATH searches in your /home first (or searches &#x27;.&#x27; first), I could get you to use my gpg instead.<p>Second, regarding preventing plaintext from getting swapped to disk before writing, you have to keep in mind that libfuse will obtain the plaintext from the kernel and then call your write() callback--you&#x27;re not safe if you only mlock() the data that FUSE gives you, since the data could have swapped to disk between libfuse reading from the kernel and calling write().  Now, I don&#x27;t know if libfuse mlock&#x27;s the write buffer first (maybe it&#x27;s a side-effect of FUSE splicing pages between the kernel and application?), but it is something to keep in mind.",1410142064

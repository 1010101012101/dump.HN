So I see SaaSaholics.com being in a symbiotic relationship with something like HN, where HN facilitates trending topics and fresh information and a forum helps for networking and long term conversations.<p>Additionally, I've setup a contest for the first 5 users to reach 100 posts at the forum. The winners will receive a free lifetime account to my SEO Competition Analysis Tool, serpIQ.com. The details of the contest can be viewed here: http://www.saasaholics.com/thread-let-s-kick-this-place-into-gear?pid=337#pid337<p>I'd love for everyone to check out the forum and participate if interested.

3031761,comment,3031574,3031574,11,0,hugh3,,,"Is this ""petitions"" feature on whitehouse.gov brand new? I've heard of a couple of petitions today, and never before.<p>I see right now that there are only 32 petitions there, and every one of them is either a neutral or leftish cause. The only <i>completely</i> nutty one is the UFO one, and there are no troll ones either (I thought ""Stop Animal Homelessness At Its Roots"" was a clever troll, but apparently it's talking about abandoned pets rather than wild animals).<p>Have conservative activists not yet got wind of this? Has 4chan not yet got wind of this? Or is the White House carefully curating what petitions it allows to appear on its site?",1316815874
3031760,comment,3030543,3031294,1,0,rilkeanheart,,,"Having launched web applications in both markets I can say with a high degree of confidence that both systems are far from perfect.  However, I think the US system suffers the most because it is ""stuck in the middle"".  It struggles to benefit from innovation because antiquated payment models often delay (if not outright discourage) it.  E.g., use of e-mail is a NEW phenomemon for many US docs.  So we don't get the benefit of truly free markets working quickly to highlight/exploit inefficiencies.  On the flip side, we get the bloat but not the benefits of a single payer system- even though most care is paid for by the government.  I think a single-payer system would be a local maximum but a truly free market would be the most optimal.",1316815783

And I think you're right I wouldn't characterize it as ""lost it"" either. Although he\ndoes appear irritated and says he was ""blindsided"" I don't think this is really representative of the Steve that I remember and commented about (no clips of that sorry..)<p>It starts at about 20:10 and Steve says he was ""blindsided"" at about 21:00 approx. as if he was misled or something by Andrew.

If they are so loyal to some country law, then they should clearly state it, instead of bragging how cool they are by rebelling against some other county law.<p>I say, if you put a service like this up, stand up for its integrity, or else, don't bother creating it in the first place.",1316815286

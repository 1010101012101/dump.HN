For projects such as Bochs [0] (~750 files in CtrlP), I get annoyed at the initial .5-sec wait [1], but after that it's extremely fast. I don't have a particularly fast processor, either.<p>I find CtrlP breaks down with large projects such as the Linux kernel. While it's fast to find the initial list of files (2 seconds or so) it's extremely slow to actually search through said list, about .5-sec per keystroke.<p>[0] I'm not a maintainer, I just happen to be using its wonderful instrumentation hooks in a research project.<p>[1] It's about half a second on my laptop, which has an SSD.

5248277,comment,5242381,5246326,1,0,contingencies,,,"<i>You are just throwing accusations right and left without comprehending the material that you linked to.</i><p>Look, I am trying to point out the bigger picture here, internationally, and developments over the last couple of decades. I provided you with one of the key open sources that provided a public touchstone for those who were aware of the abuses over a decade ago. Understanding that document should put the fear in to most people. I am forced to question whether you have read the document, but reading your comments such as <i>It seems that what ECHELON has access to is something that anybody can lay their hands on</i> and <i>I have pasted the whole section here</i> it is clear that you have not. Put some effort in, educate yourself, then come back and have a discussion.<p><i>Tell me which clause leads you to believe ECHELON actively breaks into corporate networks.</i><p>Now you are putting words in to my mouth. I brought up Echelon as one part of the information warfare arsenal deployed by non-Chinese state actors for commercial espionage purposes, which was the original scope of discussion.<p><i>If you conduct your business by broadcasting messages over a public, then not only ECHELON, but the whole world can listen to it.</i><p>Oh right. ""Everyone else deserves what they get"", what a civic perspective! Show me how widespread encryption was in the mid '90s when the world was just getting on the internet. Now show me how widespread that was for VSAT systems and long-haul ISDN being shot out to NSA satellites over long-haul microwave links. I personally worked on video conferencing and surveillance systems in that era for multiple governments and I can tell you that as far as any deployed system I witnessed across five or so countries went, nobody used passwords, ever - to say nothing of encryption!<p><i>This is much different than the ugly spearfishing and active breaking in by the Chinese.</i><p>Believing there is no targeting capability within Echelon and similar systems is a huge and IMHO poorly supported assumption. Remember, that document is 10+ years old, discussing information on the state of the art ~15 years ago. Further, after Stuxnet and other revelations, believing the west does not develop offensive information warfare capabilities is laughable. Some of us knew this 10+ years ago. They were <i>a lot</i> less careful at hiding their tracks back then (eg. frequent use of IPs within <i>reasonably.specific.descriptor.mil.somecountry</i> reverse DNS to browse the web).<p><i>Did you just keyword search and paste without understanding what the clauses meant?</i><p>No, I read that document when it first came out, in fact I was reading about Echelon before it was published, and being labelled a nut-job. Since then I have occasionally glanced at it, usually to provide a reference to unbelievers. It's very rare that someone reads it and continues to argue.<p>While we're at it of a morning, here's some more information on how normal this stuff is. It is pretty well established that the Chinese routinely supply entire mobile telephony systems to developing nations (in Africa, etc.) in order to - on the face of it - sweeten resource extraction deals, but it is widely assumed to maintain a technical capacity for signals intelligence through that infrastructure (Huawei, etc.).<p>Are they alone? Consider this: while physically on the ground for a month during the Tunisian revolution, the first of the Arab spring, I found that Vodafone offered the fastest 3G I'd ever experienced - anywhere in the world. I even had Facebook and Gmail access. To assume that communications capability was not a targetable intelligence asset for the west in some measure seems ... highly unlikely to me.<p>More to the point, Applebaum of the Tor project also visited Tunisia later on as a precursor to his being in touch with people in other Arab Spring nations. Many (most? all?) of the revolutions uncovered vast, turnkey, state-level mass surveillance and censorship tools -- supplied to these regimes by individual companies in the west.  Wikileaks then subsequently provided a large release around this: <i>Mass interception of entire populations is not only a reality, it is a secret new industry spanning 25 countries</i>. <a href=""http://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/</a><p>Now; where do you think the know-how to provide states with that sort of infrastructure comes from? Just the commercial world? Or people who have left the government fold to go commercial? I think you'll find they support each other.<p>In closing, we as technologists have a responsibility to maintain an ethical outlook on our field. Our field is a global one by definition, and therefore above nationalism. Given this context, we can either choose to contribute to paths that effect the betterment of the world through increased human rights, or to the whittling-away of individual rights to privacy, free speech and self-determination for the profit of the few. One path is easier, requires less thinking, less self-education, and offers more pay. The other is a greater challenge. In so far as I am aware, of those I personally respect, <i>real hackers prefer a challenge</i>. <i>Your</i> path is your own. Choose it wisely.",1361321983

How is this an improvement from the status quo?  (""IRC"" is just an example, you can feel free to replace it with your favorite protocol.)<p>Granted, this change makes life a little easier for users behind outbound-restricting firewalls, since you can now multiplex both HTTP and IRC on port 80.  But IMHO it would be more logical to just have nginx directly proxy the IRC server to the client-side JS over Websocket.<p>Then again, maybe this patch is as close as it's possible to get without major revisions to the Websocket protocol:  With Websocket's non-optional framing ""feature,"" you might need IRC-specific knowledge to translate an IRC stream into frames in a way that won't break anything.<p>Any Websocket experts are welcome to weigh in!",1361321814

But the sidebar of the Public Editor's page helps to clarify:<p><i>Margaret Sullivan is the fifth public editor appointed by The New York Times. She writes about the Times and its journalism in a frequent blog – the Public Editor’s Journal — and in a twice-monthly print column in the Sunday Review section. The public editor’s office also handles questions and comments from readers and investigates matters of journalistic integrity. The public editor works independently, outside of the reporting and editing structure of the newspaper; her opinions are her own.</i><p>That is, the Public Editor is an in-house critic and independent opinion, but not a final arbiter or official mouthpiece.",1361321096

I am extremely disappointed with Musk over this incident -- and now with the NYT as well, for failing to stand their (valid) ground and failing to call out Musk's blatant lies and manipulations.<p>As the dust settles, it appears that the worst that Broder is guilty of is being less than lab-test-precise in his reporting. (He did make some unfortunate decisions, such as not charging further on various occasions, but all of these decisions strike me as entirely reasonable given the facts as he understood them at the time, and -- critically -- the advice he was given by Tesla.) It should be noted that the basic thrust of his piece appears to be entirely accurate: everything started out fine; then he started having range problems; he took significant but not drastic measures in compensation; these measures were insufficient. For instance, he may have been a bit sloppy about details such as exactly when he turned down the cabin temperature or exactly what speed he slowed down to, but it's uncontested that he did lower both temperature and speed well below what a normal driver would expect in a normal car.<p>The car seems to have committed a sin larger than any of Broder's: it ""lost"" a large amount of range overnight. This was one critical element in the eventual failure (the other being various bits of bad advice from Tesla, in particular the advice to ignore the low range reading after charging for only a short period at the public station that morning).<p>But the worst sins, by far, are Musk's. He made many sensational accusations. Some seem clearly false, such as Broder ""driving in circles"" in a supposed attempt to kill the battery (Broder's explanation that he was simply looking for the charging station is far more plausible). Many more of Musk's statements are deliberate distortions of the worst kind. The ""battery never ran out of energy""... which may be technically true, but whatever energy may have remained in the main battery, the car was so dead that it couldn't even be towed without a flatbed truck. ""Why would anyone do that?"" (leaving the last charging station with insufficient charge) when it now appears uncontested that this was under explicit advice from Tesla. ""Drove right past a public charge station"" -- which he didn't know about, Tesla staff didn't tell him about, and Tesla staff had implied he wouldn't need. And so forth. His entire ""most peculiar test drive"" piece reads like something Fox News would say about an Obama policy proposal -- nitpicking, distorting, misdirecting, and outright mocking.<p>I've always been a fan of Tesla, SpaceX, and Musk, but I will never look at him in the same way again.",1361320947

I'm still not sure where to look for this in Rails.<p>Additionally, other tools you decide to use with Django don't require any extra ""Django magic"" to work — they work the same as they would if you used them alongside any other tool.<p>One example is using Less with either framework. Using Less's `less.watch()` functionality, which enables live updating in the browser based on changes in your .less file, is much more difficult to use in the Rails asset pipeline, in my experience.<p>There's pretty much feature-for-feature parity at this point, and where it doesn't exist there's a plugin or other supplemental tool.

Foods aren't created equally in terms of how satisfying they are per calorie. My point is that the conventional wisdom of eating lots of bread/pasta is counter-productive simply because they're not very satisfying. A cheesy omelet isn't more or less food than a plain bagel, but for a similar calorie count I'm a lot happier 2 hours later. That's the essence of my point.<p>> Also, anyone trying to lose weight does not need to be eating in restaurants.<p>I live in New York and so pretty much only eat in restaurants (nobody here cooks). On a keto diet it's no big deal. Restaurants make money by selling you tons of carbs to inflate entree sizes. If you don't eat carbs, there actually aren't all that many ways to blow your calorie budget. If I'm at a restaurant, I can easily order a big steak and steamed veggies and mushrooms, or fish/chicken with a fatty sauce and keep within ~600-700 calories. The restaurant has no financial incentive to give me a lot of these expensive ingredients, so they don't.

Implementing these things with Django requires uncomfortable tweaking, because custom user models have not been available until Django 1.5 (still unreleased).<p>It is also very painful to make asset pipelines work in Django (SCSS & CoffeeScript compilation and minification). There are various solutions which require various amounts of tweaking, and which can break in unexpected ways on SCSS syntax errors etc. In Rails, all this just works out-of-the-box.<p>And lastly, Django's app ecosystem is very tied into the Django ORM data model, which is currently very tied into MySQL/Postgres. If you want to use MongoDB (with MongoEngine), most existing Django apps won't work with it. On the Rails side, Mongoid is an established ODM, and there are existing gems to make most things work with MongoDB without any tweaking. This means you will have the email/password/Facebook authentication (Devise/Omniauth), RailsAdmin, CanCan permissions etc. working right away, and your whole web app can run on MongoDB if you want.<p>So, even though I'm a long-time Django user and fan, I think it just hasn't kept up with the times. Nowadays Rails works better and is more productive for typical new web projects. (But realtime/single-page-apps are a different story, there I lean towards Derby&Meteor.)",1361320088

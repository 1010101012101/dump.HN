8191796,comment,8190217,8191671,1,0,claudius,,,"What you say is true if mastery of the foreign language is required or the aim of the exercise. However, if you just want to order breakfast abroad without looking like an uncultured insensitive dick, translating sentences formed in your native language works just fine. Nobody expects people to master five-or-so languages, but putting at least some effort into learning the local language is usually greatly appreciated. Furthermore, depending on the degree of similarity between your native language and the “target“ language, forming sentences first and then translating them will actually get you pretty far – surely it will be useless if you speak, say, Finnish natively and want to learn some East Asian language, but I imagine it to work decently between, say, English and Dutch or Spanish and Italian. Even English and German share enough history that most sentences can be translated one-to-one.",1408348719

The article is all raving about speed, but completely ignoring latency. Which is at least one of the reasons why USB hasn&#x27;t completely replaced the other most common ports. USB only replaced ports for basic consumer devices without much special requirements in the timing department (and don&#x27;t get me wrong, it did that in a fabulous way, the &#x27;u&#x27; in the name was a good choice)<p>The most common usb-serial converter from FTDI does not have a completely predictable latency (mainly due to the software stack if I&#x27;m not mistaken) which can make it a pain to use with serial device which can only continuously stream data: small buffer size = no go.<p>Likewise, up until now, we still have some software using the parallel port because it&#x27;s a readily avaiable GPIO with predictable sub-mSec latency, on Windows.

People forget it all the\n     time;  no one is that consistent,  especially since code seems to work\n     without it.

You can’t do  it anyway,  even if you  were perfectly consistent; many\n     programs and commands do not support “--”.

It just does not make sense to me at all. Besides, percentages is one thing, absolute intakes are another, too.<p>EDIT: Besides, I can tell you from what I know on how people were living 50-70 years ago (grandfathers for example) that meat was expensive during their youth and that they only ate it once or twice a month, certainly not every single day like we do now. So I&#x27;m not sure where you got the impression people ate so much meat in the early 1900s while it defies all conversations I had with people who lived in that era.",1408348016

8191761,comment,8191694,8191694,8,0,spotman,,,"Choosing a message queue can certainly be tricky.<p>Not a complete list, but you should consider:<p>a.) do you need persistence?  some queues offer this, some do not.  many systems can be configured in either mode.  you might need persistence if the messages your processing are vital and shouldn&#x27;t be missed in the case of a broker restart, for example.  however if the messages are very volatile, then maybe persistence is overkill.  Or possibly, the architecture your working with handles message loss somewhere else, so its not the message queues responsibility to worry about loss.<p>b.) do you need fault tolerance?  some queues off this, some do not.  just like persistence, its often something you can enable or disable.  and like persistence, often queues can be setup so that while they might not be fault tolerant, the application that employs them is designed to work around queues going down.<p>c.) do you need high availability?  fault tolerance and high availability are separate things.  fault tolerance might just be a master falling back to a slave.  high availability means this happening and there being no hiccup in service.<p>d.) performance.  its something to consider, but your correct in thinking that this is not everything.  but sometimes its worth considering.  in one experiment I ran, Amazon SQS was about 40x slower than rabbitmq.  This may or may not be worth the trade off for you, as products like SQS relieve the developer and operations a lot of responsibility, but if 10ms average queue time (or less) is important, forget SQS.<p>e.) client libraries.  some queues have client libraries for every language in the sun.  some only offer support for one.  you would want to consider who and what will need to talk to the message queue, and if this is going to be made a nightmare if your using something very exotic or custom.<p>f.) creature comforts.  some things come with nice rest api&#x27;s, some come with web ui&#x27;s, some come with only command line interfaces, and some come with none of that.  Often things like ZeroMQ, Nanomsg, are put into these blogs and things comparing message queues.  They really are not message queues in the traditional sense.  They can only replace one after you&#x27;ve probably spent a considerable amount of time building tooling.  For example, in zeromq there is no way to ask &#x27;how many messages are pending in this queue&#x27; without writing that functionality yourself.<p>g.) queues-as-a-service.  I mentioned Amazon SQS in point d, but they are something to consider if you don&#x27;t want to run it yourself.  Running a message queue can be easy, but running a message queue that is fault tolerant, highly available, deals with message loss/deliverability, and scales as your workload scales, can be an art form.<p>In summary, you should do your own research based on these needs and others I likely forgot.  Sometimes its easiest to just pick a simple one, and then once you experience its shortcomings and learn more about your queue needs, the upgrade path will be much less mysterious.",1408347693

For a simple explanation as to why that&#x27;s not likely look at the calorie counts for berries [2]. You&#x27;d have to eat about 10 <i>pounds</i> (~4.5 kg) of blackberries a day to get 2000 calories. There are other more calorie dense non-animal foods like nuts, but most likely around 65% of a hunter gatherer&#x27;s calories came from meat [1]. This is <i>much</i> more than the amount of protein consumed by the average American today, who gets less than 20% of his or her calories from meat [3].<p>>yet we seem to live longer those days<p>Most of the improvement in average lifespan is a result of the drastic decline in infant mortality rate. Hunter gatherers regularly lived into their 70s [4] and when you account for the decline in infant mortality the difference isn&#x27;t as great as most people imagine. The combination of reduced infant mortality, medical care, and relative safety of civilization are what accounts for our increased lifespan. It&#x27;s very likely (almost certain given the obesity numbers) that our modern diet is driving the numbers down below what they should be given our other advances.<p>> That&#x27;s why we run clinical studies. To find out answers.<p>Yes it is, and those studies are showing that too much sugar (and most of western civilization eats too much sugar) leads to metabolic syndrome which leads to heart attacks. The debate is on whether sugar does this because it directly causes insulin resistance, or if it is just very calorie dense and thus eating too much simply causes weight gain, or if it reduces satiety and actually causes you to eat more.<p>I&#x27;m not saying eating like a hunter gatherer is necessary for your health, and sure we need to do research--I&#x27;m not sure why you think I implied that we didn&#x27;t. However, it seems logical (again the research we <i>have done</i> backs me up here) that our bodies may not be adapted to handle something we&#x27;ve never eaten in anywhere near the quantities we eat now--specifically the fructose in sugar.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11965522"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11965522</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://calorielab.com/foods/berries/66"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calorielab.com/foods/berries/66</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/5/1554S.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/5/1554S.full</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/gurven/papers/GurvenKaplan2007pdr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/gurven/papers/GurvenKaplan2...</a>",1408346589

Other keyboard layouts are even more different.<p>If you can&#x27;t access the <i>physical</i> layout of your keyboard (and using javascript, I&#x27;m not sure you can), using the arrow keys for all navigational things is really the best option.",1408345312

If anything, it might be a hinderance.<p>Bear with me here.<p>The main obstacle in learning a language is not the acquisition of vocabulary per se, but getting familiar and acquainted with how ideas are expressed in the language.<p>The most common mistake that beginners make is they try to form the sentence in their native language, then translate it to the target language. This approach is guaranteed to make you form BAD sentences.<p>You need to be exposed to not just vocabulary, but phrases, collocations[0], and idioms.<p>You must train your mind to use the expressions of your target language from the start .. <i>without</i> starting from some expression in your native language.<p>To get there, you need to be exposed to tons of natural speech/writings/dialogs in the target language.<p>That&#x27;s why a vocabulary list on its own is pretty useless.<p>If you&#x27;re going to use flashcards, let the entries be phrases and collocations, instead of single words.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation</a>",1408345244

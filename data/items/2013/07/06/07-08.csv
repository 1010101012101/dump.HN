5998281,comment,5997034,5998178,2,0,RyanZAG,,,"Just sounds like a mis-use of Java. Java is slower than C++, but it&#x27;s a fairly small difference, ie. between 1x and 3x the speed. So if the cpp code did the work in a second, the Java version should have taken at most 3 seconds.<p>The real reason for the difference is that the rewrite into C++ used all of the domain knowledge he had acquired in writing the Java version. If he has made a Ruby version next, it would likely have been similarly efficient (maybe 5 secs? Who knows).<p>It&#x27;s a key problem in these kind of anecdotes: a rewrite will nearly always be more efficient as it has more knowledge to work with during the architecture phase of the project.",1373097270

I&#x27;m currently in the process of compiling the results of an automated crawl of thousands of popular sites that I did last month. I think that every www user should be aware of this:<p>- The privacy model of browsers relies on the same-origin policy. The same origin policy is in practice routinely circumvented by active identifier sharing. The difference between 1st party identifiers and 3rd party identifiers has become meaningless.<p>- Self-Destructing Cookies is a proof of concept for a model that <i>actively derives</i> the minimum set of identifiers that you need to browse the web at any given moment. This is a possible workaround for a world without the same-origin policy.<p>- Cache abuse is rampant. The cache must be considered a store of identifying tokens. If you use SDC, you should <i>definitely</i> enable the automatic cache cleaning. Set the timeout to 3 minutes or so. Remember that identifiers are frequently shared. It only takes a single party to identify you from something they put in your cache.",1373095946

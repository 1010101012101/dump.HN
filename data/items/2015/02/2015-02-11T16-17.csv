9033935,comment,9018827,9022743,0,0,JadeNB,,,"> One approach to avoiding the whole question of abs(x) would be to use cosine instead of sine, since cosine is symmetric across x = 0.<p>I don&#x27;t think that this would work, since the division by an odd function would just make it odd again (that is, `sin(x)/x` is even precisely <i>because</i> `sin` is odd).  Note, however, that blaming `abs` for discontinuity (or non-differentiability) is a bit of a red herring; any even function on the real line, no matter how smooth, can be written as a composition with `abs`.",1423673972

He spent a lot of time in SV during those formidable years of the valley. When I got older, I asked him why we never moved out there, and why he never took a job in the Valley if it was the coolest place to be for tech.<p>He said a lot of the same things mentioned in this article - about the suffocating culture, people &quot;faking it until they make it&quot;, the tons of businesses being built on what he called, &quot;bullshit and blue skies&quot;. He said it wasn&#x27;t a place he wanted to raise his family, so we stayed in the Midwest instead.

When prescribing a benzo-class drug nowadays, your doctor will work with you to create a dosing schedule that includes its own &quot;taper-off&quot; period (and perhaps secondary therapies to counter withdrawal effects) to avoid addictive potential.

make me feel normal(a least for awhile).  I went to various 
Psychiatrists and was prescribed the usual regime of tri, 
and hetrocyclic antidepressants--none worked in the slightest
in my case.  I finally found Klonopin.  Yea, it worked at first, but was not better than alcohol.  I know Klonopin has 
a long half life, but in my experience the effects wore off
pretty quick?<p>My point is I feel a lot of people abuse alcohol because the 
other drugs just don&#x27;t work very well.  I remember a Psychiatrist telling me I wish I could prescribe more Klonopin, so you didn&#x27;t need to drink a six pack a day, but 
I can&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m afraid of the load on you liver.  He was right, 
and I&#x27;m glad he didn&#x27;t increase the dosage of Klonopin--I think?  I really didn&#x27;t have a say in the matter.<p>But the anxiety went on for years and honestly effected my life and career.  I went on to become an Alcoholic.<p>I got to the point where I gave up, but didn&#x27;t want to blow out my liver(I had a medical backround, and saw just how horrid alcohol was to the liver.)  I saw someone die from 
liver failure, and it was Hell.  It was beyond the worse misery I have ever seen, and it went on for days.<p>I knew I was a alcoholic, and Psychotropic medications were 
not helping me so I just decided to keep my drinking down to 
only the times I truly needed it(that meant no partying, no 
drinks at dinner, etc.)  I was a drug I used to treat my symptoms.  I stayed away from hard liquor.  Just medicated with beer and wine.<p>Well years later--my career is toast, but I&#x27;am still alive.  Most days were a pain in the ass, but I got through it, and had some good days.  If anyone reads this who is suffering from an anxiety related 
disorder;  I can honestly state that the my level of anxiety 
did get better with the natural aging process.  If you are 
controlling panic attacks with alcohol--only drink enough to 
stop the paints attack.  In my case 2-3 drinks would stop a panic attack if I timed it right.<p>My worse years were the 90&#x27;s up through around 2005.  Back in 
the ninties I could get away with a little bit of alcohol on my breath.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine self medicating today--where alcohol is so demonized in many circles, and Cops don&#x27;t take 
any sympathy. &quot;Just lock him up even if even though he blew under .08 percent.  He probally has something else in his blood stream, and through synergy, and our narrative, we can get a conviction?&quot;<p>The Psychiatriactic profession has failed us.  Very few drug

Whether or not it is legitimate to post solutions online, this is not what madaxe claims to have been penalized for.<p>In my opinion, arbitrarily shoehorning a perceived infraction into a preexisting rule that it doesn&#x27;t fit so that you can punish behavior that you hadn&#x27;t thought to disallow before the fact is an abuse of university policies.<p>If madaxe is recounting the event accurately, then I think that  the university is more in the wrong. University policies are hard enough to follow in situations like this when the university sticks to the letter of the policy. Plus, universities can always go back to update policies as they see new behaviors that they would like to disallow. But if the university uses whatever policies that they do have on the books to punish arbitrary behaviors that they don&#x27;t disallow, then it puts the student in the situation of having to predict how this practice will impact them in the future. This is essentially impossible, and quite defeats the entire purpose of having policies written down in the first place. If this practice is common, then the policies are merely legitimacy theater, and are in fact illegitimate.<p>The situation is further confounded by the power dynamics at play. Tanking a students GPA is a pretty tremendous bludgeon, and outside of retaining a lawyer, a bludgeon against which students have little defense. This power discrepancy demands discretion on the part of the university. There is a level of injustice in the act of a university wielding this power against a student without a grounding in legitimate policy.",1423671983

The hardwoods that came from old-growth forests are fundamentally different, as the wood from a tree that has survived hundreds of years is different than the wood from a tree that is only 50-60 years old.<p>One reason for this is that in larger trees, the rings themselves play less of a role in causing warping. Another is that many trees that make it to 50 years in a modern forest wouldn&#x27;t have made it to 400 years if left alone. Old-growth forests have much greater spacing between trunks as the overgrowth trees that were successful outcompeted their neighbors; to have survived 400 years indicates a tree that was given superior placement and nutrition.<p>Finally, when trees are much older, they are much larger.

I&#x27;m really deep into music, collect and buy lots of niche stuff from all kinds of genres, I listen to my collection quite a lot and enjoy it, but I find it increasingly difficult to discover actual good music that I wasn&#x27;t aware of before. Sure, we all know the usual recommendation engines and some more specific year-end lists help too, but generally the recommendations feel all too narrow - &quot;You like The Antlers?&quot; - &quot;Let me suggest this band that fits into the very same sub-genre and probably has been named all over the place before.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s just not good enough. Whenever your taste isn&#x27;t bound to certain genres, yet still very specific and hard to put into a score, it gets difficult. Actually I think this is a problem better solved by a small round of enthusiasts, real humans instead of algorithms or crowdsourced data. The latter always seem to fail when your taste ranges from, let&#x27;s say James Holden (electronic, weird, yet carefully crafted), to Miles Davis, each for very different reasons.<p>While I buy my music, I enjoy the community over at what.cd which is just as enthusiastic about music as I am. Another community that helps can be found on rdio, which I use for previewing and discovering music - I only follow people with taste I can absolutely agree on there, and I&#x27;m really not a social network guy, but the community on rdio is great and knowing what those guys are listening to is very rewarding, and sometimes a good tastemaker.<p>Yet, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m completely satisfied with those options - there have to be some better places out there.",1423671615

On its own, nicotine is an addictive but relatively mild stimulant in normal doses.

It&#x27;s an anachronism in the legal field, and one that most people don&#x27;t realize exists, but is responsible for a lot of ills in our criminal justice system.<p>There are two types of sovereign immunity granted to law enforcement and prosecutors today. The first is investigative or &quot;qualified immunity,&quot; which is the weaker of the two. This is the type of immunity detectives and police officers have in investigating crimes. Prosecutors can occasionally find themselves subject to the same level of immunity if they direct investigations e.g through specific instructions to county detectives or outright interviewing of witnesses not produced by the police.<p>The doctrine states that you cannot sue a person engaged in investigatory activities on behalf of the state <i>unless</i> you can show first that he or she violated a <i>clearly established</i> Constitutional right. So even if a police officer violates a Constitutional right, it must be <i>clearly established.</i><p>Some states and circuit courts disagree on what &quot;clearly established&quot; means on a per-right basis, but basically if a police officer busts down your door without a warrant absent exigent circumstances, they&#x27;ve lost their immunity, and you can sue him or her for deprivation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.<p>Short of egregious actions, it&#x27;s difficult to pierce this shield. Many states even have a &quot;good faith&quot; exception to this rule, where if the police officer was unaware that the right they were violating was clearly established, then qualified immunity applies. Which is a perfect example of the law gone haywire. If ignorance of the law isn&#x27;t a defense for citizens, why should law enforcement officers be able to use it to claim immunity?<p>The second, and much more powerful, form of sovereign immunity is &quot;judicial immunity.&quot; It applies not only to judges, who arguably actually should be immune from threats of prosecution, but also to prosecutors during preparation for grand jury and trial. The truly problematic part is that judicial immunity is <i>absolute</i>. It cannot be pierced for any reason, no matter how egregiously a prosecutor violates your Constitutional rights: hiding exculpatory evidence, deliberately keeping you in prison for long periods to force a plea, etc.<p>Of course there is recourse to the ethics committee of a state. However, in all but the most public and embarrassing cases, state ethics boards are toothless against prosecutors. Usually, a complaint has to be a approved by a regional reviewer, who is tied into the county legal system and has a strong incentive not to aggravate the prosecutor&#x27;s office.<p>The only saving grace here is the &quot;municipal person&quot; theory. Essentially, if a state governmental agency, such as a county, has a policy or practice that actively encourages or directs its employees, whether investigators or prosecutors, to violate Constitutional rights, then one can sue the municipality which is not protected by investigative or judicial immunity under Section 1983.",1423670634

Most of the Indian folks are frail and weak. 
IMO, a 57yr old Indian person might be equivalent to a 75yr old American. 
I don&#x27;t see the need to patting him or slamming him down. 
The Indian community has not seen a lot of violence with cops, because culturally speaking, Indians are here only for a decent salary and a good way of life, they work hard in their cubicles. They don&#x27;t roll in hoods with glocks in their pockets. So they should not be treated this way. 
Cops were supposed to help him get home, you hear stories of cops helping alzheimer&#x27;s patient reach home safely. 
How do you compensate for a broken spine? They gotta pay him millions. Alas, he would not be able to play with his grand child.",1423670515

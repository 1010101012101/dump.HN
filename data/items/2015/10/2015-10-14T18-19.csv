10388556,comment,10383043,10388252,0,0,pron,,,"> do you mean all forms of feminism? Or just the 3rd wave?<p>Different forms of feminism differ in their views on specific issues, not on the basic idea that women are allotted less power in society. Differences stem from various sources. One is historical or circumstantial: when women were overtly discriminated against by the law, targets and priorities were clearer. Another is awareness: leaders of movements for change always tend to be among those who are relatively most powerful in their group. They can therefore be blind to the plight of those who are qualitatively less powerful than them. Yet another is that inherent difficulty in interpreting wishes in a society which shapes them. I&#x27;ll just note that some anti-feminist views that try to simplify things, say stuff like, why not just assume that everyone has free will and everyone&#x27;s choices are equally free? The answer to that is that research has clearly shown this is not the case.<p>> Even if someone would be brainwashed and completely programmed to destroy the world, then IMO that person would still contribute to destroying the world if acted towards that goal.<p>Absolutely, but there is no clear programmer and programmed. We are all equally programmers and programs, and equally ‚Äúemotionally‚Äù innocent of the situation. Everyone, of course, is responsible for their own actions, but they‚Äôre actions at once are shaped by others‚Äô and shape others‚Äô. The only relevant distinction is that some have power and some don‚Äôt, and as change is better carried out by those with power, they carry most of the responsibility. OTOH, those with power, of course, are less interested in changing the situation. Not just because they don‚Äôt want to yield power, but also because they don‚Äôt see the problem.<p>> A pragmatic form of feminism that I have experienced myself is that feminists need to take care of their own personal development.<p>Of course, and this, BTW, is something that often gets them a lot of scorn. But it is important to realize that change is only accomplished when those who work for it attain enough power. That power could be in numbers or in changing the mind of the powerful.",1444848523

According to ADA codes, the maximum slope for a ramp is 1:12.  The maximum rise for a ramp is 30&quot;, requiring a landing before and after at least 60&quot; long.<p>So to climb one story in the ramped building, you need 5 ramps total, plus 6 landings.  Each ramp is 360&quot; long, and each landing 60&quot; long.  The total horizontal distance, per floor, is 2160&quot;, or 180&#x27;, or 55m.  The minimum width of a ramp is 36&quot;.  Your ramp area is going to be at least 540ft^2 (51m^2).  On each floor.<p>In contrast, each elevator takes up about 27ft^2 (2.5m^2) per floor.

I have paid enormous attention to that and kind of ignored the hand-wavy and apparently incorrect mental models popular in the medical literature. For example, the official explanation on the CF Foundation website is that people with CF are <i>drowning in an excess of mucus</i>. I found one study that says we produce too little mucus, not too much. This fits with my firsthand experience, it more logically fits with the fact that mucus is a protective coating that helps keep out germs and it fits with the extremely well known and well established fact that women with CF suffer vaginal dryness that often seriously interferes with their sex lives. I think we cough up phlegm, not mucus -- ie infection -- and if you improve mucus production, you reduce infection and see less phlegm. I have seen that hypothesis work effectively for me and my oldest son who has the same diagnosis I have. I have explained it to one woman with CF who was out of time and dying and tracked me down after I left all CF lists and took down my health site. She is gradually getting healthier.<p>So that is a very long way of saying that a) I have no idea what you mean by that phrase and b) the odds are high that you and I have completely different mental models for what is going on with CF.",1444846941

The idea was that higher deductibles would make patients become smarter shoppers: If they had to pay more of the cost, they&#x27;d likely choose something closer to the $1,529 appendectomy than the $186,955 appendectomy (yes, some doctors really do charge that much). This would push the really expensive doctors to lower their prices so cheaper physicians didn&#x27;t steal their business.&quot;<p>Even the sloppiest and most cursory examination of human behavior refutes this line of thinking-- patients don&#x27;t shop around for life-saving medical procedures because they need them urgently or semi-urgently, meaning locations close-ish to home are the only choices, if there&#x27;s even more than one choice that accepts their insurance. For plastic surgery, sure, whatever. For a bypass? No. I guess this gaping hole in their analysis went unnoticed or somehow explained away by their insufficient economic model.<p>&quot;The new paper shows that when faced with a higher deductible, patients did not price shop for a better deal. Instead, both healthy and sick patients simply used way less health care.&quot;<p>I would expect to see more plans converted to high-deductible plans after a finding like this percolates through the insurance companies. This behavior is health insurance working as designed: unused, making a fat profit for the insurers while the patients scrape by until they&#x27;re in critical condition and can&#x27;t refuse care for the sake of cost-cutting on their end. This system is evil, and it is intentionally evil for the sake of producing more money.<p>&quot;&quot;I am a little bit surprised at just how poorly patients were able to do when looking at very similar products, like MRI scans, and with a shopping tool,&quot; says Kolstad, an economist at University of California Berkeley and one of the study&#x27;s co-author. &quot;Two years in, and there&#x27;s still no evidence they&#x27;re price shopping.&quot;&quot;<p>This man is a fool of the highest order, truly an overflowing septic tank of stupidity unparalleled in obliviousness even when compared to a slime mold. How are patients supposed to understand comparisons between medical procedures? &quot;A shopping tool&quot; would be too simplistic, anyway. You need a real doctor to answer questions about care choices.<p>&quot;Workers&#x27; health spending dropped, and did so quickly. Average per-patient spending fell from $5,222.60 in 2012 to $4,446.08 in 2013. That&#x27;s about a 15 percent decline in a single year ‚Äî and it held true across all types of health services. Between 2012 and 2014, there was a 25 percent drop in emergency room spending, an 18 percent decline in physician office visits, and a 6 percent decrease in mental health services.&quot;<p>Great job, the patients have been made sicker as a result of cost-cutting measures. Looking forward to seeing more high-deductible plans.<p>Finally, there is no &quot;shopping around&quot; in the sense these economists mean. Try getting a straight itemized quote for a given medical procedure before you get it. Try comparing that with someone else&#x27;s quote for the same thing. At this point, you&#x27;ve probably wasted a few weeks on the phone/email trying to finagle these things out of the horrendous systems in place. Then, you can cross reference the results with your insurance benefits, and see how badly you&#x27;re going to get fucked. Yeah, right.",1444846647

The starting price is 30cts/transaction, and decreasing to reach 5cts/transaction on higher volumes.<p>We will probably keep this, but introduce monthly/yearly plans. Probably $19/m for starter, then 49, 99, 199... Still need to fix the thresholds.<p>We already and always have two interesting things for test, starters, or very small businesses:
- An unlimited testmode.
- 10 monthly transactions for free. Forever.<p>What we mean by universal/dynamic pricing is:<p>- Universal pricing is when you sell a product at a fixed tax-included price. For instance, you can sell an article at $10. Tax is then deduced - if applicable - and you obtain your net price.<p>- Dynamic pricing is when you&#x27;d like to have a fixed net price. For instance, you sell a monthly plan: $10 + Tax - if applicable -.
Let&#x27;s take an example: As a French company selling digital goods,
* If my customer is an French VAT registered company, the final price would be $12 - VAT 20%-.
* If my customer is an Italian consumer, the final price would be $12.2 -VAT: 22%-

I&#x27;m going to take these paragraph-by-paragraph for clarity:<p>1) I think Gates&#x27; point was that what works for Arizona midday doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for Pennsylvania or Washington. While the math might pencil out in the ideal case, he&#x27;s concerned that the focus will leave R&D in more efficient solar before we get a universally cost-efficient solution for photovoltaic. I think he&#x27;d agree with you that the goal is to have people motivated to go solar for selfish reasons (to save money). I think he&#x27;d disagree with you that you can price based on removing existing subsidies and market bias towards fossil fuels, since those subsidies are in place and the externalities aren&#x27;t yet priced.<p>3) Problem is, we can&#x27;t just shut down the coal stations without eating an enormous cost in terms of lost power production. For most energy planners, the goal is to let existing (massively expensive) infrastructure age-out and transition to renewable/carbon-neutral infrastructure on the new installation side. Otherwise the costs are untenable.<p>4) While negative pricing should incentivize investments in storage, I think Gates is looking at the imbalance in the incentives that led Germany to that point. A negative price indicates that there was over investment in infrastructure, and they&#x27;re still stuck with the coal plants for base load. Similar to my comment on #3, you can&#x27;t just shut off existing coal/oil/natural gas without hitting someone with the bill. Making that the taxpayer&#x27;s problem is not going to go over well, and the companies are going to lose tons of money if their investments in those plants can&#x27;t pay off over their 30-60 year projected lifespan.",1444846367

And it&#x27;s worth noting that, if made comprehensible, his solution will provide enough value that people are willing to take the risk of attempting to understand his work.<p>> I work for a cosmetics marketing company. We design and market three different lines of cosmetics and skincare. I do their website backend. Our products are really good, and attractively priced compared to our competition. We are not producing a Web 2.0 Social Media glorified ad server, but it&#x27;s not a shitty product, but it does need effective marketing.<p>Your product is not your website, it&#x27;s the good cosmetics at a good price. In the current economy, yes, you do need marketing to get there, but your marketing would be worthless if you had a crappy product (or maybe not, but that&#x27;s even worse).<p>So you&#x27;re working on a product that provides value, and your job is not a disproof of anything I said.<p>>  Me putting in 3x the effort isn&#x27;t going to help their bottom line a whit, and it might even hurt it by lowering the stability of their platform.<p>That&#x27;s quite a straw man you&#x27;re presenting.

But I&#x27;m also a proponent of understanding the problem you&#x27;re solving, and if you&#x27;re looking at a piece of code in isolation from the context of the business, you don&#x27;t understand the problem you&#x27;re solving.",1444846100

Can&#x27;t buy direct at Bonobos? J-Crew or Banana Republic are next door. Literally, in many cases.<p>I think that is <i>extremely</i> debatable. I&#x27;m squarely in Bonobos&#x27; target market and it is common for me to buy something that I like and have it sit in my closet for a day or two before I wear it the first time. I don&#x27;t know anybody that treats their new clothes like they do a new computer or phone...where they absolutely have to start using it right away.

No way I would pay Bonobos prices with my back against a wall like that.<p>And more importantly, the lack of having something in stock to buy at that very moment is what enables them to have a wider array of potential fits, colors, and other options while also being in stock with a high degree of probability of being at your door within a day or two. Those fits and options are part of the loyalty that Bonobos has. Banana Republic might have some pants in stock...but do they have exactly my size, the color I want, the fabric I want, and the fit that I want? Far less likely IMO. I&#x27;ve spent way too much time rifling through stacks of pants trying to find my size only to destroy a cleanly presented stack of pants and discover that they have it but not in the right color. I would much rather invest 30 minutes of my time in a Bonobos retail fitting room, and then never spend another minute in a retail store again.",1444846003

10388252,comment,10383043,10387687,0,0,mettamage,,,"I agree with the ideas you stated about social psychology & sociology. What people want is shaped by other people their encouragement. Thanks for stating it, I&#x27;m noticing I have a lot of implicit assumptions lying around there.<p>So it is indeed hard to separate cause and effect, I&#x27;m wondering if we need to, since cause and effect might go both ways here in a feedback loop. I&#x27;m very inclined to believe this myself (one of my implicit assumptions, perhaps even a bias). Cultural notions reinforces what people want, which reinforce the culture. So allowing to reframe yourself to want something different is definitely a course of action that one could take. As is changing other people their behavior (although it has some really difficult challenges IMO, it&#x27;s easier to change yourself in my experience).<p>&#x27;feminism is not concerned with who &quot;contributes&quot; what to sexism&#x27; <-- do you mean all forms of feminism? Or just the 3rd wave? I have the feeling that there are forms of feminism that do look at this, since various feminist views can also disagree with each other (2nd wave vs 3rd wave for example). I wouldn&#x27;t know which forms of feminism do look at this though, it&#x27;s more of a heuristic: since there are so many forms of feminism there must be a few of them doing this.<p>&quot;can they later be said to be contributing to their own subjugation?&quot; <-- Perhaps I have a different idea of what &quot;contribution&quot; means. Even if someone would be brainwashed and completely programmed to destroy the world, then IMO that person would still contribute to destroying the world if acted towards that goal. I do acknowledge that the initial intent was never there and this person was completely reprogrammed (assume a The Matrix scenario, where someone is plugged in and reprogrammed). Nevertheless, a non-intentional behaviour is still a contribution. Even zombies contribute to cultural notions of society (if they&#x27;d exist). So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the person&#x27;s fault for being this way, it&#x27;s the fault of the programmer. But if the person (now destroyer of the world) would realize this and try to stop it, that would be great.<p>A pragmatic form of feminism that I have experienced myself is that feminists need to take care of their own personal development. This also means that people who are aware of sexist actions and view the need to change it, need to change themselves if they have habits conforming to old views. In that sense, feminism is concerned with who contributes (behaviorally) to sexism, because it gives a lense to look within oneself to change behaviour contributing to sexism. Knowing your gender role and in which way you conform to it is a handy tool to have in general for self-reflection.<p>&quot;and when we say that some action is sexist we mean that it contributes to sexism; the action itself can be completely free of any ill intent.&quot; <-- Thanks for the clarification. I do admit that my understanding of sexism is not as laser focused as I&#x27;d like it to be.",1444845928

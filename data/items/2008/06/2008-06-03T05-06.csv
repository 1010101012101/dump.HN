207686,comment,207125,207125,0,0,andreyf,,,"<i>Often they phrase it as intellectual property that needs to be abandoned...</i><p>This is very silly ... such a position would only be taken by someone who doesn't understand the extent of IP.<p>IP is a huge blanket term, legally speaking. Patent law, copyright law, and trademark law have very little in common, but are all ""IP"". I haven't met anyone who seriously argued that we should get rid of patents...<p>As far as copyright goes, in my experience, most intelligent, impartial, and well-informed individuals tend to converge on the constitutional opinion: ""Congress should promote the progress of useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors the exclusive right to their respective writings"" (this is almost a direct quote from article 1, section 8).<p>The point of copyright law should be to promote progress of useful arts - I think this is the basis on which we should all agree. The term ""intellectual property"" muddies the discussion because one's right to property is a fundamental right, whereas one's power to restrict other's copying of your work is a power that congress can grant you for a limited time.",1212472488

I tried to keep it simple and avoid objects, but I find myself missing them all the time.

207676,comment,207486,207514,0,0,lisper,,,"Absolutely correct.<p>Over on the Lisp lists I sometimes make the point that Lisp failed precisely because it was so powerful that one person could be productive enough to get useful work done by themselves.  As a result, Lisp tended (and maybe still tends) to attract people who don't work well with others, whereas if you program in C you have no choice but to work as part of a team if you want to get anything done at all.  At the end of the day teamwork wins, even when hobbled by inferior tools.",1212471346

It may even thrive -- music creators, the ones still doing it for fun, suddenly feel a lifting of pressure to maximize or even create profit, and creativity shoots through the roof. A diversity of aural culture previously unknown, spread entirely by word of mouth and recommendation engines, dances mainstream, and everyone is the better for it.",1212471218

207672,comment,206737,207167,0,0,thorax,,,"I agree with you on every point. I hate gauntlet interviews/interviewing and the questions should definitely be targeted towards hire/nonhire.<p>Only I don't think you meant this the way it sounded, so just to be clear: ""does the candidate know how to code?"" shouldn't be the only criteria you're testing for in a good hire.<p>There's much more to a good engineer than how well they code, of course. Technical skills are key, but hiring managers need to ask things that also help reveal behavioral things like communication, teamplay, unstoppable ego, etc.<p>These can all be major problems and, in my experience (hundreds of interviews now) by the time they're at an on-site interview, these should be a major (if not the majority of) focus. Ideally, if you handle your interview process in an efficient manner, you should be pretty comfortable with the technical skills before an on-site interview where the primary technical questions/tests should be just to verify they weren't cheating off-site.<p>In the world of ajaxy collaborative text editors (e.g. Google Docs) and screen sharing tools (e.g. dimdim/GoToMeeting/WebEx), etc, there's no reason you shouldn't include programming assignments as part of phone screens using their home machines, observing their coding live on the phone/screen. Bringing candidates on-site without doing something like this (especially for a 6-hour gauntlet interview circus) is risking a day of theirs and a day of yours to find out something you could gather without bringing them in.",1212470999

I admit I did not read Dustin's article, but it sounds like it could have been any one of thousands of fawning techno-fetishist blog posts made over the years.<p>I think an interesting thing that Moxie touches on tangentially, is that life does not go as planned; things break.  Everything breaks, in fact.  Learning to recover from failure is often more important (and personally rewarding) than learning to use the tool in the first place.  You may choose to get better tools, but given time and use, these too will eventually fail.<p>Operating with the understanding that everything fails, allows us to be more flexible and pragmatic in our decisions and planning.  Assuming that something will never fail only ensures that a disaster will eventually happen, and that you will be unequipped to handle it.",1354046347

It's not just bad relative to Google Maps, but also bad compared to the previous version of Maps on iOS.  The end result is it harmed Apple's credibility.  With a single ""upgrade,"" functionality that people came to depend on was gone.  Completely removed.  And don't for a minute think this is just ranting and raving from the tech crowd.  There were signs well ahead of the release from people.<p>Sure, there might have been other issues.  With cases like this, their usually are.  But these issues resulted in Maps.",1354046343

They are the Black Swans.<p>The Black Swan theory is that the outliers shape our world.  And that has been true in tech for sure -- Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc. are all anomalies.  These companies grew enormously quickly and were all started by very young and inexperienced men.  The two YC success stories that get pointed to -- AirBNB and DropBox -- were also started by the very young and inexperienced.<p>Older people are perhaps more likely to be successful.  But there is less variance in their outcomes.  There's the logic in investing -- once you're making money, you're less valuable.  Because people know what you're worth.  Before you make any money, people can ascribe crazy valuations to you.  It will be wrong a lot of the time, but it doesn't matter because the one Black Swan event is what you're looking for.  You only have to be right once.",1354046334

On a project like this one I would like to see around $200K or $300K buffer.<p>In other words, double their costs.  the spreadsheet comes out with a profit of $39.72 if they raise a little over $733K.  At $700K you are already over $30K in the negative.  I would have gone for $1,000,000.<p>The good news is that they are not asking for $100K as LifeX did, which would have been ridiculous.

Sure, you shouldn't let the things you own end up owning you, but if you have ever had something you rely on fail (and if you are working in technology, you have), you can appreciate doing research to make sure it doesn't happen again.

Narcissists hate being around older people because it reminds them that, some day, they'll be old and unable to do the sorts of things that narcissists tend to do on the weekend. I don't think that all founders are narcissists, but if you want to be able to hire narcissists (which 75% of execs are, let's be honest) then ageism becomes practical, sadly.<p>Then again, I think some of it is subconscious and unintentional: unreasonably harsh age-grading, coming from an inexperienced and privileged set of people who've never had to do grunt work and therefore have slack-free careers. People who are young and have high career efficiency ratios expect a linear trend-- consistently improving projects-- but the reality for most people (save privileged 22-year-olds) is that they have to take the work they get, rather than being able to focus on their passion or highly-visible (e.g. open source) work. I, personally, would love to hire someone in his 60s with no slack in his career-- I'd make him my personal mentor and figure out how he did it-- but it's quite rare to find such a person.<p>The reason ageism exists is that most people have to take low-quality, career-toxic work to (a) avoid income volatility that becomes more unacceptable with age, (b) evade the ""job hopper"" stigma, and (c) remain employable <i>without</i> moving to another city every 3 years, and this creates a world in which premature decline is far more common than it should be.",1354045230

This is consistent with observations that smartphone device use increases over the ownership period.<p>2) iOS users are engaging in more casual discovery on their devices, and as such hitting more of the reporting sites in these statistics.<p>3) iOS better serves data-hungry users, either through device selection, plans, legacy, or some other factor.<p>4) iOS is worse at managing data use, on-device cache, etc.<p>5) The ""unique methodology for collecting this data"" employed by NetMarketShare, which is without detailed explanation or put to scientific rigor could be misrepresenting this data.<p>Any one of these could explain or contribute to a considerable amount of inaccurate data.

The thing that gets me is that I can only view driving directions fully zoomed out or fully in (rather than being able to zoom in and out).  However, in terms of map accuracy, their data is coming from TomTom/Tele Atlas.  Google's data is better.  Not only that, but Google has been working hard on local search.  Apple simply doesn't have that data.  I've really yet to hear how Apple could have launched a better product.  Google has been getting data for many years now and when Google Maps launched, it didn't have nearly as complete data.  As users used it, data improved.  Apple has less chance for improvement because Apple doesn't do local search and non-phone maps in the way that Google does.<p>It's why I think Apple should make a web interface to provide an easy way for people to add businesses and make corrections via their browser.<p>I mean, I vaguely remember when Google Maps switched from Navteq to Tele Atlas for a while and users disliked the Tele Atlas data.  However, if you don't own your own mapping data, you need to buy it from someone selling.  Given Nokia's ownership of Navteq, it seems unlikely that Apple would have gotten that data.<p>Other than improving the data over time, what else was egregiously wrong?  On the data side, I think it takes time with the app being used by the public to correct that.  If they were to make the hard decision not to ship Apple Maps, would the data be in pretty much the same situation a year later?",1354044831

4838315,comment,4837785,4838241,5,0,sukuriant,,,"I actually stand on the opposite side of this debate. Not using an IDE forces you to remember and think about your language and development environment. You learn the methods and APIs that you call much better when you have to research them rather than when you scroll down an auto-completing list of method names. ""Oh, this name looks close enough, lets try it!"" versus going and looking up in the javadocs or python docs or [your language of choice] docs. When you have docs that are a good read (like javadocs and python docs, and maybe boost C++'s docs too), you can read the description, the examples, and sometimes even some recommendations on how to use that code.<p>That said, going to a-whole-nother environment just to complile can be a bit of a chore. There are some text editors that come with hotkeys for compiling and running. When I was in highschool, we used TextPad. Ctrl + 1 to compile java and Ctrl + 2 or 3 for running programs (depending on if they were applets or applications).<p>In college, I used nano/pico and eventually emacs. I'm still slower in some modern IDEs when trying to manipulate text as fast as I did in emacs -- though autocomplete and jump-to-definition makes my coding faster, in general.<p>At the end of the day, though, we're two people with anecdotal evidence that strongly supports our side of the argument, in our minds.<p>Addendum: regarding debugging. I generally find, for the kinds of problems that new programmers run in to, println debugging is generally sufficient, so for debugging, I would just recommend that.",1354043981

And in August of 2003 a study published in JAMA found that among the highest-quality clinical trials, the odds that those with commercial sponsorship will recommend the new drug are 5.3 times greater than for studies funded by non-profit organizations. The authors noted that the lopsided results of commercially sponsored research may be 'due to biased interpretation of trial results.' They cautioned that readers should 'carefully evaluate whether conclusions in randomized trials are supported by data.' In other words, doctors are warned that even the best research published in the best journals <i>cannot</i> be taken at face value."" Source: Overdose America, p. 97.

However, the file drawer problem is definitely much worse for industry-sponsored studies than for, say, non-profit- or NIH-sponsored ones. MAPS has a tiny budget of less than a million dollars a year, and if they were to do a study and not publish the results they would get completely discredited. And for an NIH researcher, if they didn't publish their results then it's unlikely they'd ever get more grants in the future. I don't know of any specific stats about how the file drawer effect for NIH-sponsored studies compares to industry sponsored ones, as that would be the closest comparison. But I do have some quotes that address the issue in general, and explain why the problem is much worse with for-profit companies:<p>""The failure to publish unsuccessful trials presents a problem in many research areas. When a study has produced non-significant results, it is less likely to be submitted for publication; and, if it is submitted, it is less likely to be favourably reviewed or accepted for publication. But although publication bias affects all areas of research to some extent, it is particularly acute when it comes to drug trials. This is because most of the clinical trials evaluating medications are financially sponsored by the companies that produce and stand to profit from them. The companies own the data that come out of trials they sponsor, and they can choose how to present them to the public -- or to withhold them and not present them to the public at all. With widely prescribed medications, billions of dollars are at stake. In this case, it is not reviewers or journal editors who are impeding publication of negative findings. Rather it is the companies themselves that decide to withold negative data from publication. [...]<p>Most studies showing negative results remain unpublished, and short of making official enquiries to government agencies, their data are unavailable to researchers, doctors and the public at large."" Source: The Emperor's New Drugs, p. 39<p>""The fact that what gets published are the trials with positive results was most convincingly shown by a group of researchers at the Oregon Health and Science University, who followed up on our initial analysis of the FDA data by comparing the conclusions reached by the FDA with those reported by the drug companies in journal articles. Of 38 drug-company clinical trials that the FDA viewed as having positive results, all but one was published. In the same documents, the FDA described 36 trials as having negative or questionable results. Most of these negative trials were not published at all, and of the few that were published, most were described in the journal articles as showing positive results -- despite the fact that the FDA had concluded that they had not.""

The results were overwhelmingly positive: Twenty-two studies showed that the new drugs were significantly more effective than a placebo, and only 6 showed no difference. In Sweden, drug applications must including <i>all</i> known studies -- published or not -- relevant to the new drug. When researchers from the Swedish Drug Authority went through the new drug applications for the five new antidepressants, they found that a total of 42 studies had been completed. It turned out that exactly half of these showed that the new antidepressants are more effective than placebos and half found that they are not. The 22 postive articles that had been published represented 19 of the positive studies (three were published twice). In contrast, only six of the 21 studies with negative or inconclusive findings had been published. Even the most conscientious doctor could know only the results of the studies that had been published and would reasonably conclude that the weight of the evidence about the new antidepressants was overwhelmingly positive.<p>The Swedish researchers commented that their finding that 40 percent of the studies that had been completed on these drugs remained unpublished (as independent studies, not pooled with others) was consistent with the findings of other such reviews. In their conculsion, they warned that 'for anyone who relies on published data alone to choose a specific drug, our results should be a cause for concern.... Any attempt to recommend a specific drug is likely to be based on biased evidence.' What else can a practicing physician rely on but the published data? In an understated way, these researchers were telling doctors that they could not trust the published scientific evidence about antidepressants to be complete and unbiased."" Source: Overdosed America, p. 115<p>""Whereas many of the negative trials were not published at all, some of the positive trias were published many times, a practice known as 'salami slicing', and this was often done in ways that would make it difficult for reviewers to know that the studies were based on the same data. In some cases, the authors were different, and references to previous publication of the data were often missing. Sometimes there were minor differences in the data between one publication and another, as well as between the data as presented to regulatory agencies and the data as published. So a reviewer trying to summarize the data would be likely to count the positive data more than once.<p>Another trick was to publish only some of the data from a clinical trial, a manoeuvre that researchers call cherry-picking the data. Some clinical trials are conducted in more than one location. These are called multi-centre studies. Multi-centre studies make it easier to find sufficient patients to conduct the trial. They also make it easier to cherry-pick the data. For example, one multi-centre study of Prozac was presented to the FDA as showing a drug-placebo difference of three points on the Hamilton scale. When the data from this clinical trial was published, the difference was reported as 15 points -- a five-times increase in effectiveness. How was this magical augmentation of the benefits of Prozac accomplished? The full study was conducted on 245 patients. The published paper reported data from only 27 of these patients. In the published version, the data from the bulk of the patients were left out, making the drug seem much more effective than it really was."" Source: The Emperor's New Drugs, p. 41<p>""Drug companies also publish 'pooled analyses' of the trials they have conducted. That is, they bundle together the results of different trials and analyse the drug-placebo difference across them. This is similar to the meta-analyses my colleagues and I have conducted, but with one important difference. Our meta-analyses, in common with most others reported in the scientific literature, are based on all the studies that we were able to find. In contrast, the drug companies pick and choose which studies they wish to include in their pooled analyses. For example, GlaxoSmithKline submitted 15 clinical trials of Seroxat to Swedish regulators. In addition to being published individualy -- sometimes more than once -- studies with positive results were also included in six different pooled analyses. Most of the studies with negative results were, of course, not included in the pooled analyses.<p>There is yet another way in which pooled analyses can hide negative data. Rather than not publishing the negative data at all, the companies can bundle them together with data from positive trials, so that the overall result is positive. By so doing, they can truthfully claim that they have published the data from a negative trial, while hiding the fact that those data showed no difference between a drug and placebo. The article by the Swedish regulators showed that the data from about 20 per cent of trials were not published at all. The data from another 20 per cent of trials were bundled together with data from more successful trials, so that their negative results were hidden from view. Taken together, approximately 40 per cent of the data are kept out of sight. Practices like this [...] make it exceptionally difficult for reiewers to establish how effective the drugs really are.""

Not only has that been demonstrated to be untrue[1], but it also hurts people who have quite valid reasons (including personal desire) to keep their names or personas separated.<p>One other thing to keep in mind: it is not the name which is used that changes how you speak, so much as the context in which you speak. For example, a lot of sites started forcing ""Facebook only"" and noticed a change in user discussion/comments; I'd argue that this change was less the display name someone used, and more the fact that their discussion became viewable by people <i>outside the scope of the non-Facebook website</i>. Think about how context matters: if you are (for example) homosexual and closeted to your family, would you change what you wrote, knowing it could be shared with them?<p>There are many many more elements to this, and yet the bottom line is I think that not only do these moves by Google reflect incompetence at the executive level and a clear disconnect with the real needs of real people, but they also demonstrate a lack of respect for the things people need most online: agency and free speech.<p>I've spoken publicly at several conferences about this, and am now working to establish a ""NymRights"" working group within NSTIC, an online standards organization.

Its pretty rare, because it's often ill advised, to replace the ""entire management team"" unless you're completely changing the direction of the product. However, it is often the fantasy of engineers working on a team that has execution issues that the company would just ""fire all the managers and let us get our work done."" That fantasy comes from not knowing what the managers actually did, and that usually comes from poor communication.<p>Outside management would not know who was doing what, or how well they were doing it. So replacing all of them is like changing six different things in a misbehaving program and hoping the bug will go away. If it doesn't you wasted time, if it does you have no idea <i>which</i> of the six things fixed it.<p>The solution here is pick one person to <i>lead</i> the effort and manage <i>them.</i> Give them a clear mission, whether its 'ground truth' (accuracy), glitz, or feature parity. Set standards for quality, and then let them get it done.<p>Nothing in my career has been more frustrating than having a senior manager tell me ""We want you to solve this problem..."" and then when I came back and said ""Ok, I need this, this, and this."" and gotten push back from them? If the feedback doesn't come back as a discussion, and instead comes back as a simple denial, that is when you realize the problem isn't at your level :-).",1354043018

Today Google is so dominant that people SEO specifically for it, and Google decides what is and isn&#x27;t ok to do, and can then decimate site&#x27;s traffic based on that (as we saw with Rockstar in a recent example).<p>But if there were several successful search engines with no single dominant winner, things would be better. SEO would matter less because you would need to optimize for multiple targets, so you would get away with less tricks (or you need to work much harder to trick everyone, again with the result of less trickery). And no single company could decide the fate of every other company that needs to get traffic through web searches, which is what we have now.",1388887136

7014094,comment,7011472,7012854,4,0,dreamfactory,,,"> For starters, we built the entire Bing stack from scratch. No OSS. No common platforms like the JVM. Nothing like that. We started from nothing, and invented the server infrastructure, the data pipeline, the runtime that would support the site, the ML tools, everything. The fact that the site runs at all is a small miracle, but the site does not &quot;just&quot; run: the most remarkable thing by far is that the quality of our tooling is quite incredible, generally an order of magnitude better than the OSS equivalents. For example, the largest deployment of an OSS NoSQL datastore seems to be a few thousand nodes. The small NoSQL cluster backing our MapReduce implementation is stably deployed on a cluster an order of magnitude larger than this. This is something you only really see at companies like Amazon, Google, or MS.<p>You lost me here. Not building on OSS seems like setting yourself up or failure from the start, particularly when you are fighting a manpower war, which is where OSS is beating every proprietary entity. OSS already powers Google and Amazon and OSS db&#x27;s will scale to billions of nodes, not a few thousand.",1388887012

My view after taking all of this in: there are valid theoretical models that both support and disagree with the view that the minimum wage reduces poverty, and so far the statistics are not clear either way. Given that we don&#x27;t know, why not support more effective policies for combating poverty such as the negative income tax (Milton Friedman was a proponent of this), or even unconditional income?

I largely agree with you on both counts - I&#x27;m annoyed by them as well, but don&#x27;t think that my opinion is going to change the Python maintainers&#x27;.<p>However, I&#x27;ll point out that they&#x27;re following a very sensible &quot;stop the bleeding&quot; maintenance strategy in targeting Unicode and async first.  Whenever you need to upgrade a massive old codebase to a new way of doing things, your first priority needs to be to stop things from getting <i>worse</i>.  That means getting everybody onto the new system, either via a shim or (worst case, but true in this case) by fiat, and then cleaning up the older code and introducing new cool stuff that&#x27;s enabled by the new features.<p>The big problem with Python 2&#x27;s Unicode handling was that it made things easy on people who handled only ASCII and then dumped the problem on top of people who wanted to handle Unicode and still rely on libraries from people who didn&#x27;t know what Unicode was.  As a result, the latter people just didn&#x27;t use Python, because of the pain involved.  Guido and the core maintainers (correctly, IMHO) identified this group of people as important to the future of Python, and so they want to make things viable for them even if it&#x27;s inconvenient for a large section of Python&#x27;s existing userbase.",1388886781

7014065,comment,7013651,7013929,12,0,salient,,,"Because Google usually doesn&#x27;t use its patents aggressively. They will use them defensively, though, or even as a counter-attack. That&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s <i>incredibly stupid</i> of Microsoft to be attacking Google with search patents through Rockstar. If they piss off Google enough to start using their search engine patent trove against Bing, it may be game over for Bing. Microsoft should already consider itself very lucky that Google isn&#x27;t as spiteful and vengeful as Apple, or Google would&#x27;ve used them since day one of them going after Android OEMs.<p>That being said, I think the only solution to beating Google is developing something disruptive, and I mean that in a very classical and traditional sense (not the way disruptive is used to mean anything these days). It means you have to build a type of a search engine (or search solution) that Google not only has no interest in pursuing (due to conflicts of interest/opposite business incentives), but probably <i>can&#x27;t</i> pursue, or not without employing dramatic shifts in how they do search (which again, makes it even less likely for Google to pursue and try to beat this new &quot;disruptor&quot;).<p>And no, don&#x27;t look at Bing to provide that. They&#x27;re a &quot;direct competitor&quot; to Google, and they will always be, because they want to be &quot;in the exact same business&quot; Google is, and therefore, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll ever radically change the way they build a search engine compared to Google.<p>So what can such a disruptive solution be? I can&#x27;t say for sure, because it probably needs more factors/benefits on its side than just one, against Google. Social &quot;may&quot; be a way to disrupt Google, although I think Google is already rapidly adapting to this attack vector.<p>I think another could be &quot;extreme-privacy&quot;, which Google wouldn&#x27;t pursue anytime soon without <i>really</i> rethinking how its search business works.<p>Disruption also means attacking incumbent companies with much fewer resources through innovative business models and cost structures. Do something that would make Google&#x27;s billions of investment in infrastructure <i>irrelevant</i>. A P2P search engine like YaCy or Faroo seems to be part of that solution. Perhaps what can/will kill Google is a crowdsourced super-search engine, that ends up surpassing even Google in most capabilities, because Google would be just one company, fighting against the whole resources of the world.<p>As in classic disruption, you also have to consider this new type of search engine will be much poorer than Google in some competition factors (at least initially). I think that is the &quot;relevance&quot; factor. As the op mentions, it&#x27;s going to be very hard for anyone or anything to beat Google in relevance. They have too much of a headstart. But perhaps there will be such a thing as &quot;good enough&quot; in search, too. Maybe we&#x27;re not there yet, but perhaps we will be in 5 years, or 10 years. Until a few years ago we kept wanting faster and faster Intel processors. Now we think mobile ARM processors are more than good enough for most of our daily activities.<p>A crowdsourced P2P search engine powered by <i>billions</i> of people could perhaps reach that point, too, while offering some of that &quot;extreme privacy&quot; and other benefits that Google can&#x27;t offer.<p>Still, how do you get that first &quot;10 percent&quot; of users, that end up changing the paradigm, to start using a service that&#x27;s much less relevant than Google <i>today</i>? You do it in the same way other disruptive technologies win out against incumbents. You promote the <i>other</i> benefits, that Google can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t match - benefits that will be important to those &quot;first 10 percent&quot;, until you reach critical mass, and then you should be fast approaching that &quot;good enough&quot; relevance, too, and get even more users after that.",1388886696

I write network servers for a living - most are in C++ or Java, but I would love to be able to use Python.<p>There are a number of high-level approaches you can use to concurrency.  Shared-nothing processes.  Threads and locks.  Callback-based events.  Coroutines.  Dependency graphs and data-flow programming.<p>They all suck, and they all suck in different ways.  Processes have large context-switching overheads, and take up a lot of memory, and require that you serialize any data you want to communicate across them.  Threads and locks make it very easy to corrupt memory if you forget a lock, very easy to deadlock if you don&#x27;t have a clear convention for what order to take locks in, and ends up being non-composable when you have libraries written under different such conventions.  Callbacks require that you give up the usage of &quot;semicolon&quot; (or &quot;newline&quot;) as a statement terminator; instead you have to break up your program into lots of little functions whenever you make a call that might block, and you have to manually manage state shared between these callbacks.  Coroutines requires explicit yield points in your code, and opens up the possibility of a poorly-behaving coroutine monopolizing the CPU.  Dependency graphs also require manual state management and lots of little functions, and often a lot of boilerplate to specify the graph.<p>Python has a &quot;There should be one - and only one - obvious way to do things&quot; philosophy, and with asyncio, Guido seems to have decided that the obvious way for Python is going to be coroutines.  It&#x27;s an interesting choice, and he&#x27;s not alone in that - I recall Knuth writing that coroutines were an under-studied and under-utilized language concept that had many desirable properties.  Coroutines free you from having to worry about your global mutable state potentially changing on every single expression, and they also give you the state-management and composition benefits that explicit callbacks lack.<p>There are parts of them that suck - like having to explicitly adds &quot;yield from&quot; at any blocking suspension point, and having to propagate that &quot;yield from&quot; down the call stack if added to a synchronous call.  But having written a bunch of threaded Java server and (desktop) GUI code, a lot of callback-based Javascript, and a lot of C++ in both callback and dependency-graph style, all of those models suck a whole lot as well.",1388886245

Each button advanced the time by only one hour or one minute, and you could have only one alarm, and it jolted you awake. Awful.  I was amazed to find a LCD alarm clock that had 10 number buttons to set the time rather than the lousy two buttons.<p>At the end of my era of dedicated alarm clocks I had the Now and Zen, which sounds great but is still annoying to set, and the Philips wake-up light, which actually is pretty great.<p>In the smartphone era it&#x27;s incredible how many alarm clock apps will crash or fail to sound the alarm, which instantly gets the app a failing grade seeing as reliability is the essence of an alarm clock. They also have horrible interfaces, with skeumorphic spin dials to set the time--come on, this is a $500 smartphone, give me a keypad!!<p>I have tried many Android alarm clock apps since the one in Android, while previously decent, was ruined a few versions back.  The interfaces are bad and cluttered or full of skeumorphic nonsense.

Timely actually is intuitive and fast and it makes good use of the touch screen form factor.  There are a few features I wish it had, but I also appreciate that if they jammed every possible geeky feature in there it might collapse into an unusuable mess or, worse, it would be harder to test and thus as unreliable as some of the other clocks I&#x27;ve tried.<p>Too many things used every day get no design attention, so I&#x27;m glad Timely is elevating things a bit.",1388885683

There&#x27;s a virtuous circle in there. It&#x27;s that thing Ford showed in its early days: paying workers extra so they can buy the cars they produce yields more economic activity for the benefit of everyone -- they also bought fridges and what not.<p>The trouble is stopping just short of the level at which (by minimum wage earner standards) they begin to live in opulence. That meaning, in this case, not so much when they&#x27;re able to afford a yatch, but when they begin to consider putting on more debt than they can actually afford -- debt that won&#x27;t get repaid. In that case, a vicious circle creeps in, because the ups and downs in excess debt levels contribute to inordinately sized booms and busts, e.g. like we have now.<p>So the real conclusion should be, since most people in developed countries earn barely more than the minimum wage itself: having a large consumer class benefits everyone in the economy provided that it is solvent.",1388885488

You aren&#x27;t pouring water on it, come on!) you &quot;activate&quot; the soap and that forms micelles. This is the &quot;lather&quot; reaction. This is good, we want this for cleaning.<p><a href""http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/cleansing/products/soap-foam.ht"" rel""nofollo"">http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/cleansing/products...</a><p>>. So when you put soap in water, the ends of the soap molecules that are attracted to it latch on right away and the other ends stick straight up in the air. Any soap molecules trapped underneath will fight their way to the surface and eventually you end up with three layers: a layer of soap molecules, a layer of water and another layer of soap molecules pushing themselves away from the main body of water underneath. These three layers form the wall of a bubble .... The different ends of soap molecules are also what make soap so good at cleaning. As you learned earlier, when you mix soap with water, it lowers the surface tension of the water by separating the water molecules, as the soap molecules push up between them. Meanwhile, the other ends of the soap molecules that are attracted to dirt grab on to it. As multiple soap molecules attach themselves to the same piece of dirt, they eventually break it down into tiny particles, which then can easily be washed away<p>This is most noticed with bar soap, but I still say you can&#x27;t form a proper lather with liquid soap without wetting your hands first, and it doesn&#x27;t cover the entirety of your hands (backs, between the fingers) unless you use a TON and I mean a TON of soap.",1388885291

It uses magic glyphs that require research to interpret - especially if you come from any other programming language, because when you see things like a : b, or foo -> bar, you expect that to have some syntactic meaning.<p>The fact that the colon and right arrow in a Python annotation are, for the interpreter, a no-op, is insanely confusing to a newbie or just a generalist. It is compounded by how it would have made much more sense to reserve keywords in their places, so instead of<p>def foo( a : &quot;fruit&quot;, b : Color) -> Pineapple:<p>you could have used reserved names:<p>def foo( a expects &quot;fruit&quot;, b expects Color) returns Pineapple:<p>Which is a lot more readable in the way Python is meant to be.

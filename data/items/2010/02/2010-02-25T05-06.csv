I went to school at UC Berkeley in 2001 and my impression was that the school that spawned the free speech movement had in many ways morphed into a school that limited speech the most, much in the way the author suggests.  However, while the ""official"" speech channels were heavily censored there was always a very active underground channel that had no censoring whatsoever.<p>The speed of updates on the internet is making those underground channels more difficult to suppress (as people note about things like the recent protests in Iran) so the threat from powerful bureaucracies like the government and academia on the free-flow of information is likely decreasing.",1267076904

Of course I help him if he has an issue but the thing is he tries to solve the problem himself and maybe once in 3 years I have had to help him with troubleshooting.<p>Contrast that with the facebook login debacle, people so frustrated and helpless that they are posting on a blog post about how they don't understand why they would change the login page that they don't realize they are on the wrong site.

A highly biased opinion from this bunch:<p><i>""...it is not surprising that the tenure decision is freighted with anxiety. It takes anywhere from 10 to 20 years from entrance into graduate school for the tenure decision to be made.

Something to do with automating petri dishes and culturing? I can't help but think all these english, history and sociology professors ascribe so much anxiety to tenure because their fields are so poorly valued by the private sector. But in many fields, such as Bishop's, there are plenty of opportunities for PhDs who can't or don't want to go for tenure.

1150093,comment,1148955,1148955,0,0,Auzy,,,"To be honest, I don't believe Apple have even wounded Flash.<p>Firstly, the iPhone/iPad aren't exactly dominating the market , and it's likely that iPhone market-share will suffer a huge blow to Android/Windows7Mobile over the next year anyway (who'd want to pay premium prices for a tablet which is severely limited). iPhone's only took off because Windows Mobile was rubbish, and Job's acted as though they invented multi-touch (despite a single gesture being the only use of multitouch for ages). These days though, the competition has definitely caught up.<p>Also, its quite clear that Job's is hellbent on destroying  flash only because Adobe competes directly against Apple's main products (Lightroom vs Aperture, After effects vs motion, etc). By trying to get people away from Adobe, it helps increase Apple's market-share against Windows too (since Adobe's tools are the most commonly used in the multimedia market on Windows). I think we can safely say therefore since they are competing that we can't believe what Job's says. Safari crashes when flash crashes because unlike Google, Apple didn't have to foresight to design Safari properly. This wont be a problem once Chrome takes off and Firefox is improved.<p>Either way, the main problem for killing flash is that there doesn't appear to be GOOD tools to create HTML5/JS/AJAX/PHP/SVG applications/games. For flash, you drop a few images in a view, set keyframing and woot. For svg/html5/etc? You pull out your code editor and start messing around. Flash is easy enough for high school students to create, whereas other standards mostly require a degree. You also forget that flash is an open standard, that Android is getting Flash this year and that Google can index Flash now.<p>Sorry, unless Apple or Google develop a tool to replace Adobe's Flash Creation tool, I don't think Flash will be killed off so easy. Yes Google may kill of Flash for video playback, but Flash is so much more than that (furthermore, Google don't appear to have much interest in destroying flash anyway).",1267076113

Many great poets (Keats, Shelley, Byron, Sylvia Plath, etc) died at a young age. Not only did that limit their output at a later age, the resulting aura around death at young ages contributed to their reputation.<p>2. Other great writers (Shakespeare, Joyce) wrote poetry when they were young, and moved to writing longer works in slightly different forms as they got older. Their later works are even more acclaimed, and are actually ""poetic"" if not exactly poetry.<p>There are many, many poets who are critically acclaimed and wrote their best work much later in life.

Create 10 jobs, make 1MM revenue, get them verified by IRS, you're in the clear.<p>If we look at H1-B situation, what makes employers abuse it and almost makes H1-B holders useless (for anything other than their current employment) is the tie visa has with the employer. If we make H1-B holders move around freely between jobs then there is less room for abuse. IMHO.",1267074481

I would say drive, and the willingness to dream (and take risks) is almost dead among your average Americans who HAVE the skill and talent to develop science and technology.<p>I've had discussions with my co-Founder about this (we're applying for YC this summer). We believe the American dream has morphed. Everyone is scared in our generation. We're scared of not getting jobs, of not living the cushy lives we thought would be handed to us as kids.<p>Now, our generation is more than happy to settle for a shitty internship, to settle for ok, to settle for ""getting by"". It's because we're scared. Scared of what our future holds for us (which no one really knows haha).<p>Of course, there are exceptions, but I'm speaking about the high school and college segment as a whole. These are my opinions from what I see in talented people I know.",1267074375

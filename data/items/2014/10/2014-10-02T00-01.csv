8398849,comment,8389731,8390954,1,0,orionblastar,,,"I believe the correct term is humanist. A humanist wants equal rights for all human beings and not just certain groups based on certain characteristics. Does not claim one group is superior to another.<p>Feminism used to be different, it used to be like humanism, now I see it as a tool to tear down white straight men and claim women are superior and deserve special treatment. I didn&#x27;t always have that view, but after seeing a lot of Feminist groups attacking Hacker News using hoaxes and untrue statements I eventually came to that conclusion. I have never seen Hacker News or YC discriminate against women, and anyone who posts a sexist statement gets downvoted.<p>I think on 4Chan and Reddit a lot of these sexist men are really boys under 18 who are not mature yet and hide behind an anonymous name to lobby death and rape threats at women. I just don&#x27;t see that in Hacker News or YC, when men are mature they don&#x27;t do those sorts of things.<p>So yes sexism does exist and there are issues, but not everywhere. The word Feminism in itself is sexist because it only mentions the female gender and there are more than male and female genders out there. Hence Humanism would be a better name or Equalism because it does not mention gender.<p>I want to state that equal rights is different from special rights and entitlements. If anyone wants a career in IT, they have to study hard at math and science, they have to work for years to become an expert sometimes as many as 15 years. You can&#x27;t just avoid studying hard, blow off math and science, and then study arts instead and then claim you are owned a job in IT because of your gender. If you want a job in IT, study math and science instead of art, keep learning and gaining experience over the years to become better so you can get a job. Communication is a key, and about 80% of the job. If you cannot communicate with others effectively and keep using the terms mansplaining when something is over your head and you need help with, it isn&#x27;t going to help the team and make you look bad.<p>Admiral Grace Hopper, Ada Augusta Lovelace, Sister Mary Kenneth Keller, and many others studied hard, worked hard, developed the experience and skills they needed and didn&#x27;t have anything handed to them, or were entitled to anything, or required special treatment. They just studied math and science, studied hard, worked hard, and reached their potential to develop the experience and skills they needed to do what they did.",1412211440

8398844,comment,8392138,8397266,2,0,Havvy,,,"Rust 1.0 is supposed to be somewhat minimal, so things like custom operators and monadic syntax are out scope since they can be bolted on in a backwards-incompatible way in future versions. Active patterns would probably also fall under this.<p>Likewise, having functions have their own private global state is not on the table, and seems to me to actually be unsafe since the function could be called at the same time in two different threads overwriting the operations done to them.<p>For not warning when returning non-unit values for unit returning functions, a lint could probably help there.<p>Type inference isn&#x27;t changing. The rule is that items need to be explicitly declared and expressions are inferred. Closures are expressions while most (all?) functions are items. It&#x27;s a purposeful limitation on inference based on experience with prior languages.",1412211378

Could use a theorem here, that a divisor of a divisor (of <i>x</i>) is also a divisor (of <i>x</i>).<p>A way to put it: <i>p+1</i> can&#x27;t be divided by any initial primes; and, if we keep dividing divisors, we eventually can&#x27;t divide any more, and that&#x27;s the definition of prime (indivisible &quot;atoms&quot;!).<p>I like seeing the overall process as: each time you find a new prime, it could fill in a gap between primes in the list, or be greater than any of them. Or, be smaller than any of them:<p><pre><code>  3*5 +1 = 16    -> 2\n</code></pre>\n[BTW I can&#x27;t tell if this is guaranteed to find <i>all</i> primes (though I conject it does); but that&#x27;s OK, as the proof doesn&#x27;t claim that, only that it always finds <i>one more</i> prime. Maybe there are some sets of initial primes that will always miss some prime/s - a proof of that might go deep.]<p><pre><code>  \\tangent\n</code></pre>\nRegarding code vs proof, I like what rspeer/tjgq said on abstractions/theorems - accepting a lower level, and working above that. But code is different, in that its purpose is to <i>do</i> something. If it does that, then it &quot;works&quot; in a practical sense (even if buggy). Thus, I can tell that the lower levels are working well enough, for my purposes.<p>In contrast, the purpose of a proof is to convince me that it&#x27;s true. Sure, if I accept the theorems, and I accept the proof given those theorems, then I accept the proof. But this means that in order to be convinced that the proof is true, I have to be convinced of all the levels.<p>The difference isn&#x27;t code vs proof in themselves, but in their purpose. I demand <i>a lot</i> more of a proof!<p><pre><code>  \\idea\n</code></pre>\n(Not Curry-Howard, but...) Maybe I should make a programming language for making <i>convincing</i> proofs that does work like code (unlike coq, which aims more at professional mathematicians). It can be lacking features, like handling infinity; it can be slow.<p>You &quot;run&quot; the proof to check it; you can &quot;step into&quot; theorems (like a debugger or some theorem websites which hyperlink them), or collapse/hide them.<p>It would be set-based, and so fundamental in that sense. I&#x27;m not sure if it would actually create sets and operate like an algorithm on them; or if it would use theorems about sets. I think the latter is necessary for &quot;proof&quot;, but it wouldn&#x27;t be as convincing... Generating examples would be helpful, to show it &quot;working&quot;. hmmm... some proofs work kind of &quot;by example&quot;, but with variables. What makes it a &quot;proof&quot; is that it works for the full range of values needed. So emphasising that approach might help.<p>The language would enable you to divide up an issue into possibilities in various ways, and automatically check that each limb is addressed (this is the basis of proof to my mind: you divide up the issue, and show that this covers all possibilities; then handle each limb. e.g. the predicate &quot;is prime&quot; or not). You can nest divisions. Not far from pattern matching, as in ML/haskell.<p>The actual proof part would be chains of <i>implies</i>: given x, y is true. These can be theorems/libraries: in the stdlib, or a third-party library, or your own &quot;app&quot; (or, the language&#x27;s built-in axioms and theorems). So you can&#x27;t just magically go from one step to the next; you have to specify a theorem for that step (<i>call</i> it). Perhaps the most basic ones would be implicit (like implicit casts), to avoid too much tedium. You can then &quot;step into&quot; these calls, or collapse them. Actually, just defining a new theorem is a way to collapse it (debugger &quot;step into&quot;, collapsable tree and hyperlinks are just UI choices - vim ^] is another way to navigate calls, conceptually expanding/collapsing).<p>A key convention here would be that it&#x27;s not enough to be correct if it&#x27;s a complex, confusing, tedious &quot;spaghetti proof&quot;. You want clear proofs, that ideally formalize intuitive notions. You build libraries that might not be the most concise, but that give you theorems that &quot;make sense&quot; and are useful for building <i>convincing</i> proofs. Libraries can compete etc for the &quot;best&quot; formalisms.<p>That is: unlike mathematicians, we don&#x27;t <i>aim</i> at brevity or elegance, but at being convincing, intuitive, easy to understand. Accessible to ordinary people - pop-proofs, like pop-science, pop-psychology, pop-art etc. And I wouldn&#x27;t be doing this magnanimously, for the poor ignorant masses, but because I need it myself!<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be doing anything very clever, just easing the cognitive burden of complex proofs:<p>record the detail (just <i>document</i> management alone is helpful); hide/reveal one part at a time; automatic checks; affordances whose existance guides you to sensible operations (e.g. divide it up; implies; implicit theorems). There&#x27;s also the fundamental aid of helping you formally defining the problem in the first place... which can be hardest part of proving it.<p><pre><code>  \\implementation\n</code></pre>\nThinking how this would actually work. Each line would be an expression following from the previous expression + a theorem. Conceptually, we are transforming the expression in each step.<p>In a way this is bad, because you&#x27;re having to explicitly type so much... in a regular program, you just call a function, and you don&#x27;t need to show the returned result - it&#x27;s hidden in the execution. We could do that here, but it would be less clear:<p>This unclear version would look like: a starting expression, then a sequence of transformation theorems/calls (specifying exactly how they&#x27;re applied). You&#x27;d run it to see the sequence of expressions as it was transformed.<p>A problem is we&#x27;d have to specify tediously what we want. For example, given expression <i>a and b</i> and operator <i>-></i>, it couldn&#x27;t know whether we want <i>a</i> (or <i>b</i>) - or something else, because many things are implied. So the operations would to be very precise. Like, extract the first operand; extract the second operand. It&#x27;s similar for trivial operations like commut/associate <i>a and b and c</i> - we must specify precisely which ones to permute. I guess we could have a &quot;permute&quot; rule that operates at a higher level (i.e. actually a theorem...); or even have an &quot;operator&quot; that specifies the operation via the result... so it&#x27;s no longer really an operator, but a kind of declarative system that I first mentioned.<p>One option is some &quot;live&quot; editing environment, so we can get the result of the call automatically.  A couple of problems: we might not want the literal result, but an implicitly transformed version (e.g. trivially, like re-ordered terms). We&#x27;d also have to specify <i>exactly</i> how the theorem was applied - this might be a problem anyway (if it&#x27;s to be automated).<p>I&#x27;m thinking that the engine works out how to apply the theorem to transform the starting expression into the resulting expression... but that might be too hard; we may need to tell it exactly how to apply it (like positional arguments to a function).<p>But... I guess it <i>might</i> even be a good rule of thumb, that if we <i>can&#x27;t</i> mechanically work out what the step is, it&#x27;s too complex!  And if the user really wants it as a single step, they can write a theorem, that breaks it down enough into smaller steps simple enough for the compiler to understand. That seems to serve our goal, of convincing... at least, in principle. It might be tedious in practice.<p>For implict theorems, it seems commutativity/associativity would be OK; maybe distributivity - but if a big change, might be hard to follow.<p>Inference: We might allow <i>any</i> theorem to be implicit, provided the engine can infer not just how to apply the theorem, but what the theorem actually is (i.e. find some way to justify the step). This is quickly heading towards an automatic theorem prover, at least for very simple proofs. A problem with this is that the step might be less clear - that is, although the engine can work it out, the user might not be able to. This could easily happen in practice, even if the engine isn&#x27;t very clever, by it having a library of very advanced theorems that the user doesn&#x27;t even know about (this might be partially mitigated in an active environment, where the engine suggests the theorem - like a tooltip, google suggest, autocompletion).<p>Two kinds of transform, equational (an equal expression) and implies (not equal, but some aspect of it e.g. a and b -> a)",1412209829

In my experience that AP person will simply enter their PO directly into Quickbooks and email it directly to the supplier- whose email contact is already setup in QB.

You&#x27;re advocating for the OS compat shim applier to run on every call to load a DLL into the process space, not just every call to start a process. The former can be many times the latter.<p>2. You&#x27;re suggesting the OS change third-party code (if only in memory) and said third parties will be okay with this. (App compat shims in Windows wrap the OS function by modifying the import table, not the callsites.)<p>3. You assume &quot;the relevant function&quot; is something that exists. It&#x27;s perfectly valid to generate functions at runtime. The shim would have to patch all the places that generate code, all the places that generate the places that generate code, and so on.<p>4. (Function pointers can cross DLL boundaries.) b.dll contains a function that returns the result of getOSName(). b.dll passes this function pointer to c.dll. c.dll executes it and gets the unshimmed name.<p>Edit: As an example of (3), consider that c.dll is a Java JAR that contains JNI calls to getOSName(). The shim would have to patch the Java interpreter that interprets that JNI call bytecode so that it instead generates a function call to getOSNameCompat. Then it&#x27;d have to shim the Java JITter that eventually generates native code from the bytecode so that the native code calls getOSNameCompat.<p>And don&#x27;t forget the Java interpreter and JITter aren&#x27;t even in c.dll, they&#x27;re in the process that&#x27;s loading c.dll, so the shim isn&#x27;t even limited to the same file that necessitated the shim in the first place.<p>And what is the Java interpreter / JITter anyway? c.dll only requires to be loaded by java.exe, but java.exe is provided by Oracle Java, OpenJDK, and any other Java vendors. Would the shim have to know how to patch each of those depending on which gets used to load c.dll, just because c.dll needs a shim?",1412208494

Which do you think is worse -- a false positive or a false negative? I ask because this diagnostic category has plenty of both.<p>I would want to be very sure about a depression diagnosis before assigning it, especially to young person with little life experience. These questionable diagnoses can change the direction of a person&#x27;s life, possibly cause him to think of himself as permanently handicapped, brain-damaged, after a spell of the blues followed by a superficial diagnosis from a &quot;professional&quot;.<p>Because of how little we know about depression, most diagnoses are in a gray area.

8398641,comment,8398339,8398339,10,0,ObviousScience,,,"> [Siren] allows women to peruse men’s pictures and their answers to the “Question of the Day” (“You found a magic lamp and get three wishes. What are they?”) and view their Video Challenges (“Show us a hidden gem in Seattle”). If a woman is suitably impressed by a man’s answers, she can make herself visible to him. Only then can he see what she looks like.<p>So they fixed the use case where the woman&#x27;s photo is exposed, but leave the same problem for guys?<p>I&#x27;ve had a couple creepy female stalkers, and honestly, would prefer the same protection they&#x27;re offering women. It&#x27;s certainly the case that dating sites are dominated by creepy men, but a high ratio doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate to a lack of problematic female actors. As a side issue, the fundamental gender imbalance of the website actually legitimizes the problematic world view that creates many of these problematic guys in the first place - namely that relations are a game in which women hold the power and they just need to play a numbers game if they want to win, with perhaps adjusting their wording to slip by filters.<p>Further, I don&#x27;t think this app actually solves the problem it attempts to: it actually lowers the effort on the part of bad actors, since they only need to maintain one profile rather than messaging many women. I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;re proposing to have women sort through a large number of profiles that are made by bad actors any more than they could sort through a large number of messages made by bad actors, nor do I think that filtering the profiles is a fundamentally easier task than filtering the messages would have been. (Actually, I think the opposite: that it&#x27;s easier to make a misleading profile than a misleading message.)<p>Glad to see another sexist project pitched as a solution to social problems.<p>Ed:<p>I actually want to tone down my comment a bit, but will leave the original wording as is. I don&#x27;t mean to condemn the authors, because they&#x27;re addressing a complicated and sensitive issue without any known solutions. That being said, while I think their hearts were in the right place, their execution seems to focus primarily on /their/ issues, while completely ignoring the issues faced by the other side of the equation. Programming things that solve your problems and not other peoples is hardly unique to this case or a new development (heck, it might be the hallmark of software), but it&#x27;s disappointing in this case, because they clearly have many well thought out features, that unfortunately, I&#x27;m completely unable to take advantage of to solve my problems or my issues with online dating.<p>Let me say that again: the inherent sexism of the app is particularly disappointing, because while it does many of the things I&#x27;d want in a dating app, it refuses to let me use them and instead frames me as enemy-until-proven-otherwise.<p>I just don&#x27;t understand, at a fundamental level, why both sides don&#x27;t have their pictures hidden and only be allowed to interact via their video/question/etc interface until both sides approve. (Well, I have one conjecture, but I&#x27;m reluctant to ascribe it as true: that they&#x27;re tacitly admitting women want eye candy, not just personality, and that their app isn&#x27;t meant to serve the interests of men.)",1412208374

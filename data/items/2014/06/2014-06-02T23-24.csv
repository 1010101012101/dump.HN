7837295,comment,7835892,7836869,1,0,bambalapitiya,,,"Multi lingual sounds sexier - tongues FTW... but it definitely doesn&#x27;t communicate the idea that you can speak 6 to 12 languages. Multi lingual people usually implies people who are naturally competent in language learning and may have a mother and father tongue plus another one or two learned languages. Polyglot on the other hand implies someone who has made it their life&#x27;s work to speak many many more languages and take all their language beyond a high school level of proficiency at that. And \nmaking sense and being understood, in a very specific way, is the art of speaking a language, so I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s fitting that these type of people have deliberately identified another word to describe them. Also the syllables of &quot;poly&quot; and &quot;glot&quot; allude to a much deeper, almost poetic, and definitely masterful level of understanding of language. Polloi being the the greek root of many and also glotta being an adjoining word for &quot;having a tongue&quot;. The sound glot is onomatopeic too as you have to use your tongue to successfully sound it... and simply the conjugation and associated meanings thus imply a mastery of pronunciation and not just meaning.<p>So, to counter your mild objection to the sound, I would say it does communicate more. (Honestly, I find myself surprised that I had so much to say about the difference too!)<p>Re: your idea... I like the idea of it being run by language teachers for language learners ... but do you think people learn languages best from RosettaStone type products? I think they are like gyms - they make money from everyone&#x27;s intention to speak a language / get fit, rather than support people&#x27;s actual learning and development. I learned french for years at school but any passion for learning it never really sunk in until I was actually in France. And I&#x27;ve learned portuguese through one to one lessons in person, over skype and by travelling. And I&#x27;ve done audiobooks and apps to keep it alive in my mind when I&#x27;m not able to learn first hand... but I don&#x27;t think I could actually learn a new language without speaking to an actual speaker person. Point is, I think you learn a language faster with a stronger need to be understood.",1401753281

DDG have made the first real inroads in search in over a decade, and they&#x27;ve done so quietly.<p>I can think of a number of widely touted alternatives which utterly failed to do so:  Cuil, Bing, Blekko, A9, Teoma, and more (a DDG search shows a bunch of skeletons: <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22new+search+engine%22+challenge+google"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22new+search+engine%22+challenge+...</a>).  None has had the traction DDG seems to have garnered.<p>I see a confluence of a number of things:<p>• Snowden.  People are now privacy conscious, and aware of the tremendous amount of information disclosed in Web searches.  DDG&#x27;s huge traffic spike following the Snowden disclosures is testimony to this:  <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html</a><p>• Google is the one to beat.  Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Rackspace, and others see Google as their primary competition.  This creates an alignment of interests among them.<p>• Google has shown vulnerabilities.  Failures to execute on a string of social efforts, most recently G+, as well as an increasing sense of distraction, as well as possible signs of weakness in its core search business, suggest a vulnerable underside to Google.  DDG isn&#x27;t big enough to cause real damage yet, but it can certainly get Google&#x27;s attention.<p>• Democratization of search.  Was a time when massive datacenter investments were necessary for search.  That&#x27;s both no longer the case, <i>and</i> DC infrastructure&#x27;s getting cheaper, both of which cut away at Google&#x27;s core competency and advantage.<p>• Google&#x27;s lost its favored status among the technorati.  While it&#x27;s not clear who&#x27;s won that crown, there&#x27;s an increasing strong sense among many that Google have failed at their &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; pledge, have disappointed users, and simply don&#x27;t have the chops they once demonstrated.<p>• Specialized search is making inroads.  OpenStreetMap is taking on geosearch, Wolfram+Alpha and Knoema specialized data search, Wikipedia is a basic more-or-less-trusted repository of actual <i>information</i> (as opposed to random Web sites), Amazon is a product and bibliographic research library.  There are places to go for information which, if you&#x27;ve got a <i>specific</i> interest, are better than Google, and they&#x27;re carving off bits of the search market.<p>So, yes, for the first time in 15 years, search looks like it may be ripe for a bit of disruption.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong:  Google does some things amazingly well.  Date-bounded Web searches still draw me back (I did some here to turn up a few of the more obscure search contenders from the early 2000s), the Google Books Ngram viewer is fucking awesome, Google Trends isn&#x27;t bad, and a few other elements.  <i>Reliability</i> of Google services is amazing.

But instead, the OS offers web browsers and Twitter as ways to open the link, because it&#x27;s not really a player.fm link as presented to the user, but a t.co link. If the user then chooses a browser, the browser immediately redirects to the correct URL, which then pulls up the intents menu again.<p>You don&#x27;t even have to go that far. Just click on a youtube link. First it&#x27;ll ask if you want the www.youtube.com url to play in a browser or the app (which sucks), then it&#x27;ll redirect to m.youtube.com and ask you again.<p>Only reason I haven&#x27;t set it as my permanent choice is because I still hold out some shred of hope that the youtube app will be able to play an entire video without stopping for 2 seconds every 3 some day in the future.",1401751882

But it also seems that people are too afraid to build anything until users give them a green light every step of the way. I.e. we&#x27;ve gone too far the other way.<p>I&#x27;m literally stuck in meetings sometimes debating whether or not to put a hold on the next electronic prototype of a product because we&#x27;re unsure how to position the UI: pixels on the goddamn screen, of the old one. Because we can&#x27;t move forward until we know exactly what we&#x27;re going to build... Excuse my frustration, but if this is your legitimate source of contention as a startup, then you&#x27;re probably building a commodity rather than a technology. Which is fine, but definitely isn&#x27;t the case for all companies.<p>How many user surveys are enough to show interest in a concept? How many email signups on your landing page should it take to move forwards and build out a product? Here&#x27;s a harder question: you have a prototype, you&#x27;ve done some user surveys - when to direct the team&#x27;s attention to finishing out the product rather than market research (a serious issue for say a 3-person team).<p>The way I see it, anyone can make a decision with perfect information or someone telling you just do it, while the opportunity for a new venture lies in moving fast in the general right direction.

Let&#x27;s now think of the line of communication that you and I have got between each other, which is impoverished, because we have to try and translate complex ideas into language, and how many times do you find you&#x27;ve got a good idea, it&#x27;s almost in symbolic thought inside your head, and you really</i> can&#x27;t <i>articulate it to someone. And when you</i> do, <i>they get the wrong idea, because really, language can&#x27;t encapsulate it until it&#x27;s fully formed. There&#x27;s no good evidence that I know of that these brainstorming sessions will come up with a solution or a new idea.</i><p><i>What they</i> might <i>do is improve a little bit of team spirit, or show some of the people in the group, &quot;well, if that&#x27;s the best they can come up with then I&#x27;m doing OK&quot;. The idea that you can marshal creativity is an error. I&#x27;d go a little bit further than this: if there is somebody who&#x27;s spending 80 hours a week running a creative team, I&#x27;d stop them right there and tell them &quot;you don&#x27;t</i> run <i>a creative team, you</i> allow <i>a creative team to run&quot;. That would be the first thing I would jump on. People ask themselves &quot;how do I make a team be creative?&quot; You don&#x27;t.

7837126,comment,7835649,7836746,1,0,Holbein,,,"I think there is reason to doubt that TouchID stores your fingerprint as a hash. Let me elaborate:<p>Even after the initial priming phase, TouchID continues to learn and adapt to your fingerprints. So during priming, you could always place your finger flat on the sensor, and then after that, during usage, you can continuously use different parts of your finger, and if at least a part of your finger overlaps with a previous image of your finger, TouchID unlocks the device and - crucially - it continues to learn those new angles of your finger.<p>This indicates that TouchID internally aggregates an image of your fingerprint during actual usage. Now to merge those images together, you have to compare previous images with the new image, to find a common section. And you can&#x27;t do that if you have only got a hash of the previous image.<p>I think therefore just by looking at its operation from outside, we can infer TouchID stores a fingerprint in a way that it can reproduce the fingerprint itself.",1401751066

Go isn&#x27;t bad, either. Scala has its drawbacks, but it&#x27;s often a reasonable option, too. The key thing to remember is that all of these languages have offered developers a stable target, and they are seriously usable in the present.<p>Given the announcement of Swift, and given that Apple will very likely deliver on it by the fall, we very well could see it becoming a major player during 2015.<p>The safety benefits that Rust could theoretically or potentially offer are virtually useless to huge swaths of the industry as long as the predictability of a stable release just isn&#x27;t there.

The unfortunate reality, however, is that we really aren&#x27;t seeing the &quot;once Rust is mature&quot; part actually happening.<p>There is still a large amount of change happening to the language and to the standard libraries. Some of this change has been of a here-and-there nature, where it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re trying to find an optimal or perfect solution that most likely does not exist.<p>C++11 (and C++14) may not offer the level of safety that Rust potentially could, but unlike Rust it&#x27;s usable today, and using modern techniques does a reasonable job of avoiding dangerous situations.<p>It&#x27;s been claimed that Rust will have stabilized and 1.0 will be released before the end of the year. Given that we&#x27;re already into June, this becomes more and more doubtful each day. Now Rust is facing even more competition with this announcement of Swift.

Clearly, f() has access to the entire context that surrounds it, not just the objects explicitly used in the function code. In this example, the compiler could not possibly have known I was going to access x.<p>This means in Javascript, as well as in Ruby, when you hand a closure to my code, I can access the entire environment of that closure.<p>Contrast that with Lua, for example, where the compiler does indeed check whether an outer variable is being used and then it imports that variable from the context only.<p>PHP does it most explicitly, forcing the developer to declare what outer objects they want to have available within the function.",1401750102

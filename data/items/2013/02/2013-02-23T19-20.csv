I do like Xfce more than Unity, but not enough to keep using it. I actually really quite love Cinnamon and Mint in general, although it could do with a lot of polish, especially the default login manager which isn't the best. mint-update is very buggy too and half the time just doesn't work. Overall though, it's a happy experience and it looks better to me too.",1361649594

5271207,comment,5268364,5268364,1,0,Bryan22,,,"This seems to me, like the least efficient method ever for dealing with the problem. Ok you want to find 'rivers' in text. To do so you have to turn that text into an image and then run it through your app, then go back and manually correct the problem? What was the point of the app again? I don't care if it took 1 line of code or 1000, this seems completely useless, when the anomaly is blatantly obvious when proofreading. Not to mention if you wanted to fix it dynamically, you'd end up with an image of a block of text instead of text, no big deal for print, but devastating for SEO..
""ok smart ass what would you recommend?"" is that what your thinking? Well, since you asked; why not take an open source text editor and add an algorithm that stores each line of text in an array, find the index of all the spaces and compare it to the previous and next lines of text. If the index of spaces are relatively 0 between lines; you have a river. If the indexes increment or decrement; you have a river. Now add an extra space somewhere or move the last word on the last line to the next line. Whatever solution is most aesthetically pleasing. Now your rivers are getting fixed on the fly and you don't need to take a screenshot of a block of text to analyze it.
 Maybe I missed the point of the article, but i thing those of you praising their solution aren't taking into account what the problem actually is, and the fact that their app doesn't actually include a solution to the problem.",1361649473

Overall it was a great experience - nice work on the wrapper. I think you're right - I was trying to use Msgpack to do more than I could do with JSON (namely, to transmit NSData without having to stringify it). When I realized all the NSData objects were being automatically converted into strings when the data structure was inflated, I figured I'd need to prevent that behavior and do it on only certain keys (which would need to be specified somehow, hence my thought of a schema).

I like the redundancy and the DRM free-ness of it. The last time I seriously investigated (and ripped the bulk of my library) was in 2005 when I was also active on Oink. The prevailing opinion then was that EAC with LAME and VBR was the best trade off of a secure rip, high audio quality and small file size. To let iTunes rip with it's default AAC codec produced to many errors. Also, at the time I was on a Windows machine and iTunes was so bloated and slow I refused to use it. I had an early iPod with Rockbox which freed me from the need to ever use iTunes.<p>When I got my MBP, I initially used RubyRipper. Then I found XLD and have been happy with it since (using LAME+VBR settings).",1361648546

There are lots of long bug reports on Chromium's tracker with little effort to fix them. Custom fonts render too thin to the point of discontinuities in the glyphs. The blitting algorithm was messed up so non-black text is often rendered a significantly different color than is specified in the stylesheet. High DPI support is nonexistant (while it was supported for Mac and Linux quickly), so rasterized text is simply scaled up by fractional multipliers, which makes it terribly blurry in both the UI and webpages.<p>I can only imagine that so many on the Chrome team are running Macs and Ubuntu that they don't see how terrible their software is becoming on Windows in fundamental ways.",1361648487

I will attempt to summarize and respond to the key ones here:<p>#1: The list is missing a lot of very well-known JavaScript gotchas.<p>That's intended.  My goal here is not to provide a complete, comprehensive list of all known quirks with the language - those exist in far better fashion on the web already.  Rather, my goal is to create a simple list of issues that I KNOW will trip up newbies out of the gate.<p>Oddness with truthiness, undefined and arrays is definitely irksome, but from my experience people tend not to run into those problems until they've already written a good chunk of JS.  On the other hand, issues like var, confusion over closures, and the this keyword come up very quickly - almost immediately.<p>#2: The list seems very negative and biased against JavaScript.<p>My apologies, as that was not the intent at all.  JS is great.  But it is also extremely flawed and there are some things flat-out wrong with the language.  I'm definitely not the only person who says this, either.  :)<p>It's a great language to work in and you can do some wonderful things with it once you grok it, but if we're going to be completely objective, we have to admit that it has some definite problems that make it hard to learn.<p>#3: This seems full of preferences, not hard-and fast rules.<p>That's definitely by design as well.  I circulate this list out to my team and so it has my fingerprints all over it.<p>If this is a real sticking point with you guys and you feel it would be better having that stuff removed, please send me some pull requests and I'll be happy to review.<p>#4: The author comes across as snarky and unhelpful.<p>That's just a personality flaw and I apologize for it.  :)  I didn't want this piece to be dry and I injected a bit of voice.

It is possible that it will perform better or worse, not sure, but more probably better.<p>2) Believe it or not Redis Pub/Sub was never tuned for speed so far, nor profiled / optimized, because as far as I can tell nobody asked for more performances given that with the order of magnitude we can see with both Redis and ZMQ, it is pretty hard to hit the wall. However there are demanding applications, so probably it's worth doing it.<p>3) Maybe ZMQ only uses one core as well, otherwise to have an absolutely fair comparison, N Redis nodes should be used simultaneously. Pub/Sub is the kind of application where sharding sometimes it is really really easy, just by channel. In general with Redis you have three options to go distributed with Pub/Sub.<p>Option A) Have N nodes and shard by channel.<p>Option B) Use replication, as it also does PUBLISH of messages on slaves.<p>Option C) Use Redis Cluster, but currently it is in alpha. However it already does message propagation across all the cluster so it is very easy to implement a reliable HA Pub/Sub system with it. However currently the propagation is not smart, every message is propagated to every node, however in Redis the cost of Pub/Sub is proportional to the number of receivers, so this is usually not a big issue, but we'll improve this aspect in the future anyway.",1361647292

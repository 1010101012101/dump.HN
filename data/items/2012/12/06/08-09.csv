However, since the region has had a population decline for many years, the housing market is quite cheap and I can live alone in a comfortable 62 m (670 square foot) apartment for around $500 a month.<p>Even though I earn just around average, I'm currently not very interested in moving to an economically strong region because my feeling is that the cost of living would probably just eat up whatever I would earn more.",1354784341

Very articulate and nicely written. \nI've been amidst the academia -> industrial fun transition myself this past year, absolutely best decision i've made in the past half decade.<p>One point you only lightly touched on, but which I think is worth restating is this: in academia theres this frustrating sense of ""if you're not narrow, you can't be deep"", whereas I see a lot of the more sophisticated bits of industry really valuing folks who strive for broad depth.<p>Would you agree with that assessment?<p>(admission: i'm presently having a go at building some tech products/tools that tie into a whole range of my researchy interests)",1354784308

The Maps fiasco is a great illustration of how Apple have an institutional blind spot around the complexity of doing online, data-driven services right - and won't invest (despite $120bn in the bank) properly to deliver these. This is the single biggest thing that relegates them to ""just a consumer electronics"" firm - and as we know, CE firms are lucky to have 10 years on top.<p>The other interesting data point is the bidding for the new TLDs in summer 2012 (<a href=""http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/rss/1136468/Amazon-Google-domain-name-frenzy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/rss/1136468/Amazon-G...</a>). Amazon and Google bidded on 150+ new TLDs between them. Apple? With $120bn in the bank, they applied for... .apple.

So I stayed in the Netherlands, where living is still somewhat affordable.<p>I also wonder about the high difference in pay comparing SF to anywhere else. It's interesting how much geography still pays a big role in a supposedly 'flat' interconnected world, especially in job types that could easily be done remotely. I guess the 'flat' world is a myth up there with other modern myths such as 'meritocracy' :-)<p>I always imagined the future as moving somewhere where land is cheap, buy a house with plot of land, and then work remotely.

Matrices are essentially numerical vectors with a dimension attribute. They are for numerical calculations, in particular matrix calculations. The only similarity between Data frames and matrices is that they're 2D. Think of a data frame as a spreadsheet: one column can contain dates, another floating point numbers, another a categorical variable (factor). A list is a 1d container in which each element can be pretty much anything. Suppose you had a list in which each element was itself a vector, and all those vectors have the same length.

4880913,comment,4880369,4880369,11,0,itry,,,"The big questionmark I see with Apple is: They artificially reduce the usefulness of their products. Can this strategy work out in the long run?<p>They market themselfes as uber-user-friendly. But thats not the feeling I get from their devices. I often feel frustrated by my ipad. Examples:<p>* I was on holiday in a hotel. Before leaving in the morning I looked up the road map of the local subway stations. They had a nice PDF so I wanted to save it. I didnt find a menu entry for that. I thought ""Whats going on here? Where do you hide something as simple as the save command, Apple? I dont have time for searching!"". In a hurry, I went to the internet for help and Googled ""ipad save pdf"". Answer: You cannot do it. What the fuck? You sell me a computer and then you dont allow me to save files on it? A real pain for no reason. I grabbed my android phone from my pocket, saved the PDF and was ready to go.<p>* Some days ago. I went out for lunch with a friend and wanted to show her a couple of photos I recently made. So I plugged my ipad into my notebook with the usb cable to copy the photos over. When I dragged the photos onto the ipad i got ""action not supported"". What? I got a strange feeling... googled ""copy photos to ipad"". And again... not possible. Is this a joke? Ok, so started a webserver on my notebook and then copied one by one in Safari.<p>Yes, I probably could achieve those actions with additional software. Itunes on my other machines and some apps on my ipad. But I dont want to. I dont feel comfortable with that. I have certain expectations about the basic functions of a computer. I have enough other tablets, phones and notebooks laying around.<p>* Development. Last year I hired a programmer to write a special tablet software for me. When we planned to go ios or android, from what I understood with ios you have to jump through a lot of hoops to get the software on your tablet. While on android you can just get an apk file and run it. So it was a no brainer to go with android. And it worked like a charm.<p>I heard similar stories from people who wanted to copy mp3s over to their ios devices. And from people who wanted to use their iphones for tethering. I told them ""Well, on my android, theres a button for that. It must be on your iphone somewhere too"". Just to find out, that even the iphone hardware would support it, there is no software for it built in.<p>Can that work? Artificially reducing the usefulness of your own product? Even though the competition is offering fully functional products?<p>Are there any historical examples?",1354783503

I didn't want to push my launch to September, but realized that I can release a private beta while waiting for the results in August. If selected, it's a one month delay and it's worth it because I would get publicity that I can't get otherwise. <p>I'm not YC-funded. If you're curious, my startup is in my profile. <p>Plus, I just read a post here yesterday about the benefits of collecting a lot of emails to announce the launch to; and I like that strategy.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32696</a>",1183784282

32896,comment,363,32893,0,0,Zak,,,"Since I haven't used a language where unset variables are null or tried to design one, I'll assume you're right. I haven't had to use boundp much in Lisp, but I've had to use its equivalents in other languages quite a bit when working on other people's code for money. I suspect that boundp showing up in code a lot is a sign of badness - most likely in the choice of variable scope. I'm not sure if leaving it out will encourage people to write better code or just write their own workarounds.<p>Edit: aand binding test results to ""it"" reminds me of Apple's Hypercard. I will read the entire thread carefully before asking questions next time.",1183781151

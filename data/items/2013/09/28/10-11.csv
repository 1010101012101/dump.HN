In the future I could imagine that extended so that a subset of cores are 64-bit only.<p>As others mentioned, though, I don&#x27;t think Apple will need to do that since they&#x27;ve got a closed ecosystem.  They can just declare one day that they won&#x27;t accept App Store submissions that don&#x27;t include a 64-bit version and very quickly move the entire universe of iOS software.  There will be some no-longer maintained apps that aren&#x27;t updated but they can just say &quot;Sorry, this app doesn&#x27;t support iOS 8&quot;<p>There are also binary-translation techniques like what they did with Rosetta in the PowerPC->Intel transition.

High (invisible) refresh rates were also &quot;professional&quot; equipment. I worked at home by having the computer connected to the antenna input of the plain small black and white CRT TV. That&#x27;s 50 Hz refresh of the screen. Interlaced. If you grew up on LCD screens you certainly don&#x27;t know how 50 Hz refresh feels. And I saved the assembly code to the cassette tape recorder. If I was lucky, if it didn&#x27;t crash and cause the whole RAM to be wiped out before.

Who are you to say they are wrong when they talk about their own anecdotal experience?<p>Speaking anecdotally, I got exposed to PHP before I did to Python. I tried Python after hearing how much more amazing than PHP it was. I understand why people say that now, because Python has a &quot;flavor&quot; that I suspect most programmers find more pleasing. I also learned another thing: I am not more productive in Python than PHP.<p>PHP, like JavaScript, is a language constructed out of good parts and bad parts. They both suffer from the same ailments. It is painfully easy to construct code examples of their horribleness, there are mountains of bad code floating around the internet, they lack essential facilities like strict typing, many facilities that they do provide should be carefully avoided, and the overall flavor of the language is just plain weird. However, PHP, like JavaScript, allows you to be remarkably productive.<p>JavaScript got out of the doghouse when Douglas Crockford wrote his book and converted the JS community to the jslint style of programming. JavaScript didn&#x27;t change, but the perception and practice of it did. I think PHP needs a similar champion who is willing to say: PHP can be a good and proper language, provided you use it correctly, and btw here is a tool that tells you whether you&#x27;re doing that in your code.<p>I am a PHP programmer, and to your high and mighty attitude I say: screw that.

It&#x27;s hard to explain, Dooms and Quakes do move &quot;consistently&quot; the bad UI animations have something &quot;uncanny.&quot; Just as an example the original &quot;rubber band&quot; animation in iOS is perfect, &quot;natural,&quot; (the stuff reacts exactly as it should according to your actions) the iOS 7 Safari &quot;animated buttonbar and urlbar slide&quot; or Windows &quot;hiding and showing taskbar&quot; or &quot;hidden menus&quot; in old MS Offices just unnatural when you&#x27;re doing something opposite.<p>Interestingly enough, iOS didn&#x27;t have any &quot;distracting&quot; animation (for me) until iOS 7. Nothing that I&#x27;d wish to turn off. It was just &quot;slick&quot; and &quot;natural.&quot; It also had that &quot;stability&quot; of the interface -- once you see something then nothing disappears or moves &quot;just so&quot; or &quot;creepily on its own&quot; only as the result of your actions, so nothing had the &quot;creepy unnatural slides or transitions&quot; whereas Windows was full of exactly such ones since at least XP. I always believed it was only &quot;MS just doesn&#x27;t have taste.&quot; I think Jobs somehow had that deeper feeling how the things should behave (that can be traced back I think even to the influences from his work on video games with Wozniak as he was young -- knowing that the movement can be synced &quot;properly&quot; even with the slow processors and CRT screens, if you really care about it) and now the people who do implement the transitions don&#x27;t do it to that &quot;ultimate naturalness&quot; goal.",1380364257

I don&#x27;t think I could handle seeing those animations hundreds of times every day, and for a couple of years of owning the device.<p>I want my phone to do stuff fast, especially if it has a benchmark-breaking chip inside. What&#x27;s the point of having such a fast chip, if you can&#x27;t <i>feel</i> it&#x27;s fast in everyday use?<p>Whoever is in charge of the design of iOS7 clearly had no coherent vision about what iOS should do, like Scott Forestall (and Steve Jobs) did. The UI is all over the place, and it seems filled with random design gimmicks of the 2005-era (translucency, parallax, zooming in and out, very bright colors, etc) to make it &quot;feel cool&quot; or whatever. Reminds me of Vista and all of those crazy Linux environments.<p>I want my OS to help me do stuff fast, and productively, not show me a circus on the screen, with everything I do.",1380362749

It adds an implicit data dependency between an instruction and previous results.  In a pipeline, the results of previous instructions aren&#x27;t available immediately, there is usually a delay of many cycles before a &quot;previous&quot; instruction actually finishes and retires.  So if your &quot;current&quot; instruction needs the result of the one before it, it&#x27;s going to have to wait, stalling the pipeline.  Adding extra dependencies such as instructions that depend on the state of the flags register is not desirable.  IIRC it also makes register renaming hard when one implicit register (the flags) is heavily used.",1380362625

Selling bonds is essentially like getting loans.  You find that a bank will lend you the money you want at 7% interest and that investors will buy your 6% interest bonds.  So, you sell the bonds to the investors and your costs are lower.<p>With stock, they get a share of your company and if it does better than expected, they get more.  With bonds, it's fixed.  Should your company go under, they're entitled to be paid before your shareholders are.  And if you own the company, that means that the bondholders will get their money back before you get to see anything from the failed business.<p>While bonds are by no means no-risk items, they're very different from stocks and more akin to the loans that a bank would make.",1246111185

676858,comment,676732,676732,0,0,Tichy,,,"I must admit I find that style of describing things way too confusing. I have a much easier time understanding things if they are presented directly (one paragraph problem description, one paragraph solution). For example I understand the wikipedia description much better: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_combinator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_combinator</a><p><i>Problem</i>: how to write a recursive function if the function doesn't have a name I could reference it by.<p><i>Solution</i>: since the result of the Y combinator applied to a function is the same as the function applied to the Y combinator applied to a function, we can use that instead (in brief Yg = g(Yg)).<p>However, it is interesting to me that maybe some people have an easier time with ""dumb"" explanations. On the other hand, maybe many people think they are bad at maths because all they ever got were dumb explanations.<p>The problem with the dumb explanation: it is far too long. All the stuff that is only decoration needs to be loaded in the brain and distracts from understanding the real issue.<p>Also, why explain Y combinator and recursion in one go? Would be easier to explain them separately, two smaller chunks, easier to load into the brain and easier to digest.<p>Sorry that I can't be more enthusiastic about that paper. It is certainly praiseworthy if someone at least tries to make such things understandable.<p>I have the same gripe with ""Goedel-Escher-Bach"" - it took thousands of pages (or something) just to explain Goedel's incompletenes theorem, which can actually be described in two pages. The unsuspecting reader might not even realize that GEB is about that theorem. (I simplify - it has been decades since I read it, but I think really Goedel's theorem was the gist of it). It was an entertaining read, but still.",1246110737

One fun story from that book is when Ryanair started competing with the ""official"" airline Aer Lingus, who basically thought all airport equipment belonged to them and were annoyed by the new upstart, to settle their differences they had a soccer match between the employees! However since they weren't really familiar yet with all of Ryanair's employees, Ryanair imported some pro outside players and won the match and thus their approval to share some of the equipment.",1246110395

Not start-ups and/or business, but just hacking on for fun in our spare time. I really enjoyed that conversation and would like to have more like it.<p>With that goal in mind, I suggest we use Saturdays to highlight our open-source and/or side projects that we're working on. Saturday seems like a logical fit since it is generally a slow news day, and what better time to talk about our ""weekend projects"" than the weekend?<p>So, to get the proverbial ball rolling, I submit to you my most recent side project which I released earlier this week, the WordPress Console.<p>http://blog.jerodsanto.net/2009/06/introducing-the-wordpress-console/<p>If you've developed in Rails then you know the joy of script/console. I have been writing a lot of WordPress plugins for clients lately, and wanted a way to interact with the development environment similar to how I can when writing a Rails app. This desire resulted in the WordPress Console, which is a plugin that creates an in-browser shell where you can execute arbitrary PHP code with the full WordPress env loaded.<p>It isn't a huge technical achievement or even all that challenging to create, but it is kinda cool, imo. The project is also still wet behind the ears, but usable.<p>What do you think? Worth developing further? Have ideas to make it more awesome? Anybody want to join in and hack on it with me?",1246109213

Sometimes, however, due to the discussion at hand I simply use the vote to indicate ""me, too"" -- especially when it's a discussion that seems to be coming to (or trying to) come to a consensus.  I certainly don't want to submit an ""I agree"" comment; I just up-vote.

676823,comment,675544,676111,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Anything casual will crumble under pressure...</i><p>This is true, but it misses the point. Keeping your online identities separate isn't a security measure. (And when it is -- when you're a political dissident facing imprisonment or torture -- it's very very risky.)<p>You maintain separate identities because it sends a social signal. The signal is ""I recognize the distinction between professional and casual behavior; between public and private behavior; between an artistic pose and heartfelt sincerity. I understand basic social and literary conventions and I know how to use them.""<p>A classic example: Fake Steve Jobs, who I think is a pretty good model of proper literary behavior. Daniel Lyons wanted to have some fun, so he concocted a persona and started a blog under that persona's name. The persona's voice is distinct from that of Daniel Lyons, the journalist (which is why so many people say things like ""man, he was so good as Fake Steve; why are his <i>Newsweek</i> articles so uninspiring?""), which in turn is almost certainly distinct from Mr. Lyons the person, Mr. Lyons the family member, and Mr. Lyons the party animal. But Lyons obeys the conventions. He doesn't just type everything that comes into his head into one blog.<p>Obviously you should expect your prospective employers to Google you and read your public writing, particularly that which might pertain to your field. (I told my new employer all about my writing on HN, for example.) But just as it is your responsibility to observe proper social and literary convention, it is also your employer's responsibility: Just because it's easy to riffle through Facebook and MySpace (the online equivalent of following your prospective employee around at night, peeking into his or her windows) doesn't mean that employers are ethical when they do so.<p>But Google makes window-peering so easy that it's sometimes hard to avoid. So: Pseudonyms, my friend, pseudonyms. Not to mention Pepys' brilliant invention: the posthumous diary. (I sometimes wonder if I should start a web service for writing posthumously-published blog posts. But it's kind of the anti-viable online business: It has <i>negative</i> word of mouth (your customers would prefer that their friends and family don't know about it), and the writers have pretty poor interaction with the audience, and nobody will ever have enough faith in your privacy policy or performance warranty.)",1246107888

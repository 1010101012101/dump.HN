I know how to build cool stuff; I learned that in a community that was good at building stuff (the open source world).<p>I don't know very well how to pitch it, who to pitch it to, or when I've got it right.  But I'm trying to figure that out, as are a lot of folks here.  Pooling experience tends to pay off.",1207918652

Either way, Microsoft has to take a more modular approach if they're going to sustain backwards compatibility and continue innovating in future OSs. The effort to remain backwards compatible has outstripped the effort to innovate. Vista is the proof.",1207918347

160948,comment,160925,160925,0,0,hunterjrj,,,"This article is pure FUD. Sure adoption of Vista is slow, but so many mission-critical applications are built for the Windows platform that businesses won't be moving away from it any time soon. Not until there is a sane upgrade path or they are finally forced to invest in something new (be it a rewrite, etc.), which realistically could be decades for some.<p>The majority of home users still run some flavour of Windows, and likely don't have a reason to upgrade and won't until there is a compelling reason to do so. Processor speeds and RAM sizes are ""good enough"" for most users now, and have been for the past couple of years.<p>Windows as a fashion is definitely pass√©, but it won't get thrown out like your old Vaurnet T-Shirts and Bugle Boy jeans...",1207918002

160942,comment,160004,160685,0,0,jmzachary,,,"I know. I caught that. My point is that is the kind of logic that the rest of society might latch onto. The risk is that study drugs are at a non-trivial risk of being perceived as a silver bullet for the larger societal problem of deficient school systems and American competitiveness. Maybe it wouldn't be mandated but it might be encouraged.<p>This entire discussion is making me want to go take a pill.",1207916157

I have a a stack of programming books on my desk, I actually look at code to try to get my mind around what is going on. But I don't program. What I do bring to the table is experience, an understanding of why an application needs to exist and why current solutions don't exist. I just saw that Angie's List just received a good chunk of funding. That site's founder is not a hacker, but obviously has been instrumental in its success.",1207916147

160939,comment,160918,160918,0,0,motoko,,,"We actually tried using other systems, here's what I thought and why I eventually chose Slinkset.com:<p>- News.Arc [<a href=""http://arclanguage.org/install"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arclanguage.org/install</a>]<p>I got this installed and running behind Apache but, long story short: this system is to be administered via an Arc Lisp prompt. No other tools exist. If you're Paul Graham, that's great, but most communities will have difficulty justifying Lisp and Unix expertise qualification to moderate a simple forum. Further, Slicehost started baulking about ""suspicious memory use,"" suggesting that we had misconfigured MySQL. Finally, the system was simply not as stable as I would have needed it to be. Everytime a new directory or file? had to be created, the application would simply return a blank screen, for example.<p>Update: Also, sometimes while writing long comments (like this one), I'll get the ""unknown link"" error when submitting.<p>news.arc would have earned us a fist full of nerd dollars, but I understand that sometimes nerd dollars are simply not acceptable tender in all circumstances.<p>-  [<a href=""http://reddit.com/reddits/create"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/reddits/create</a>]<p>Has all the features we want, but is a part of Reddit: Reddit domain, Reddit users, Reddit ads, etc.<p>- Create Your Reddit [<a href=""http://reddit.com/reddits/create"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/reddits/create</a>]<p>Has all the features we want, but is a part of Reddit: Reddit domain, Reddit users, Reddit ads, etc.<p>- Drigg [<a href=""http://www.drigg-code.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drigg-code.org/</a>]<p>Drigg is a collection of Drupal modules to recreate Drupal. The installation and configuration was such a hassle, the effort to strip all the unneeded features was too much, and worse of all, I got a Javascript error when trying to vote. I was not pleased by this precedent of needing to debug complex software to do a simple task.<p>- Pligg [<a href=""http://pligg.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pligg.com/</a>]<p>Pligg is a very close clone of Digg in PHP/MySQL. I installed this system without trouble, but the required configuration / feature stripping left me open to other suggestions.<p>- Linkherd [<a href=""http://www.linkherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkherd.com/</a>]<p>Kevin (rms) suggested both this and Slinkset three days ago. He showed me <a href=""http://www.linkherd.com/science/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkherd.com/science/</a>, which I liked better than slinkset.com, but at the time, Linkherd.com was broken. Fail.<p>- Slinkset [<a href=""http://www.slinkset.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slinkset.com</a>]<p>Had all the features I needed to get started, founders were responsive and obviously working on the site, killer auto-submit RSS feature, let us use our own domain, no configuration.<p>Brett Gibson of Slinkset has been very responsive, and he tells us that more features like CSS and HTML templates are coming soon.",1207915950

I don't think they should be banned, because that's censorship, but I don't necessarily ""like seeing"" Valleywag stories on News.YC. However, that's why I have a mouse, eyes and a brain..

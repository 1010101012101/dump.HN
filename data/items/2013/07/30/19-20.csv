The RBIT instruction in the article significantly speeds up an operation at very low hardware cost.<p>Polynomial evaluation does not fit into this pattern, because you need actual arithmetic operations to do it, and so a hardware polynomial evaluation instruction has no significant benefit over the corresponding sequence of explicit multiplications and additions.",1375214380

It&#x27;s not a screed against the military-industrial complex, but an urging for balance.<p>More context for the quote on the front page of that site:<p>&quot;A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.<p>Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.<p>Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. <i>We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations.</i><p>This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.<p>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.<p>We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.&quot;<p>The sentence in italics is interesting. Depending on whether you count the VA, the U.S. defense budget is $700-$800 billion. Corporate profits last year were roughly $1.8 trillion.",1375213975

They chose fruit because they consider it the healthier alternative, not because it&#x27;s a more appropriate reward. It really is the case that it&#x27;s all about our finite capacity of willpower, and how we rationalize it away.<p>Since realizing a few years ago that willpower is finite and must be periodically recharged i&#x27;ve remapped the way i go about things to remove the possibility for negative choices or to make the right choice require less willpower. For example, when i commit source code the server runs a jshint syntax check and prevents my commit if there are issues. I have no choice but to make all my code pass jshint checks. Another example: recently i noticed i spent a lot of time playing a game that i considered a negative use of my time. In a single limited moment of willpower i deleted it and my savegames, so that it would cost a great deal of effort to get back to where i was. The easiest path now is not to play that game.

I love these new frontend JS frameworks - particularly Angular, Facebook&#x27;s React, and the Guardian&#x27;s Ractive - technically they&#x27;re fun to learn, mind-expanding, and really impressive work.<p>But using them has the effect of shifting computational work from the server and network to the client - eg, from an environment you control to one you don&#x27;t.<p>Besides the examples you gave, what if someone loads your site on an overworked computer with multiple apps running and 20+ browser tabs open (yours truly, guilty as charged), how will your app perform?  The potential performance variance across different platforms, and even similar platforms under different loads, can be large.<p>It was just a year ago that Twitter announced they were shifting page rendering from the client back to the server specifically to solve that problem [1]:<p><i>&quot;When we shipped #NewTwitter in September 2010, we built it around a web application architecture that pushed all of the UI rendering and logic to JavaScript running on our users browsers and consumed the Twitter REST API directly, in a similar way to our mobile clients. That architecture broke new ground by offering a number of advantages over a more traditional approach, but it lacked support for various optimizations available only on the server.<p>To improve the twitter.com experience for everyone, weve been working to take back control of our front-end performance by moving the rendering to the server. This has allowed us to drop our initial page load times to 1/5th of what they were previously and reduce differences in performance across browsers.&quot;</i><p>While both JS performance and Moore&#x27;s Law march on [2] and may one day negate this issue, my rule of thumb so far remains to favor server-side (and CDN) for computation and performance, unless there&#x27;s a clear business/technical case for computation-heavy front-end (SPA on a corporate Intranet is good one, for example; or an SPA targeting an audience you know is savvy about local resource usage).<p>[1]:    <a href=""https://blog.twitter.com/2012/improving-performance-twittercom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.twitter.com/2012/improving-performance-twitterc...</a><p>[2]:   For desk/laptops at least.

E.g.:<p><my-directive model=&quot;myModel.foo&quot; compact=&quot;true&quot;></my-directive><p>Is it plausible that HTML eventually defines a meaning for `model` and/or `compact` attributes? Did you just write illegal HTML? Yes. Is there already a way to do this in HTML? Yes, the `data-*` attribute namespace is free to use.<p>The whole dirty-checking thing requires an insane amount of CPU work, sometimes. Once youre doing 15 or 20 AJAX requests, your browser may use 100% CPU for minutes (and thats on desktop)! Why? We arent exactly sure. But I have bumped into other people at local JS meetups who have experienced the same thing. (Their solution? Give up and use Backbone. Ours? Load fewer things. I think it may also be viable to do all your network requests out of the Angular context to avoid a full dirty-check cycle on each `readyStateChange` event, but thats not entirely straightforward, either, since we used Angular services to create our models, which know how to load their own dependencies ack its a mess.)",1375211988

It&#x27;s a neat approach and this talk laid a good conceptual foundation for the next step: coming up with a solution.<p>In my case, my work on Light Table has certainly proven at least one thing: what we have now is very far from where we could be. Programming is broken and I&#x27;ve finally come to an understanding of how we can categorize and systematically address that brokeness. If these ideas interest you, I highly encourage you to come to my StrangeLoop talk. I&#x27;ll be presenting that next step forward: what a system like this would look like and what it can really do for us.<p>These are exciting times and I&#x27;ve never been as stoked as I am for what&#x27;s coming, probably much sooner than people think.<p>EDIT: Here&#x27;s the link to the talk <a href=""https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/tbd--11"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/tbd--11</a>",1375211566

These are generalizations, but pretty accurate:<p>Lower class people in the USA think being rich is high spending.<p>Middle class people in the USA (a shrinking breed...) think being rich is having a high income.<p>Upper class people in the USA think being rich is owning nice assets.<p>Its funny how if you look at an economics equation like &quot;assets&quot; = &quot;sum of income&quot; - &quot;sum of spending&quot; each social class thinks success for everyone (although actually only valid within their own class) is maxing out a different variable.<p>Its no great surprise they&#x27;re confused as heck when they talk to and with each other.<p>For example this is the legendary tightwad rich dude trope.  Poor dude doesn&#x27;t understand why rich dude doesn&#x27;t spend constantly like a drunken sailor because thats how he defines success.  On the other hand, rich dude doesn&#x27;t care about spending, it doesn&#x27;t show up on his cultural radar, all that matters to him is nice assets.  And thats why all of us have to sit thru the tiring stereotype whenever hollywood wants.  Boring!<p>Look at attitudes toward higher ed.  Lower class doesn&#x27;t see poor starving students spending bling, therefore its a negative to be avoided.  Middle class fixates in it as a high income jobs program, all that matters is getting the credential for the job.  Upper class sees an education as a lifetime asset, gives you something to think about for the rest of your life, if you do it right.

We have no national sales tax, but each state can levy a sales tax, also each county and each city can tack on their own tax to that. In New York City for example, there is a additional small sales tax that is a fraction of a percent that goes to the MTA. Each percent of the sales price can go to 2-3 or more different places. As a result a product can be taxed differently down the street. Each item is taxed differently, food isn&#x27;t usually taxed, unless it is restaurant food. Clothes are in some places are aren&#x27;t in some places. Sometimes clothes are only taxed if they cost more than a certain amount.

This guy was relatively lucky.<p>The ultimate fault lies with the drug laws, which provide for punishment of victimless behavior, incentivize smuggling - and as this case shows, indirectly trap innocents.<p>On a practical level, this incident shows that it&#x27;s necessary to examine the trunk, the underside of the car, one&#x27;s luggage and so on, every time - and still something may have been hidden.",1375210949

If a woman divorces her husband and he commits suicide, the woman may be blamed for the manner of the divorce, whatever that may be, but it was not her choice for the man to die. Conversely, if Aaron didn&#x27;t commit suicide, the prosecutors would be no less responsible for their cruelty and injustice towards him.<p>Your moral responsibility for what you do to me has nothing to do with how I choose to react to it.

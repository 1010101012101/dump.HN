Examples include the\nproximity fuse, sonar, radar, the atomic\nbomb, the U-2, the SR-71, GPS, and more --\nall of these were funded just from proposals\njust on paper, without any &#x27;execution&#x27;,\nand came out fine.<p>For projects by entrepreneurs, my guess\nto do something similar is (1) pick a\nbig problem, one where clearly a new and\ngood or much better solution will be\nwarmly embraced by the market, (2) do\nsome research, original, powerful, \nvaluable, to get the desired solution\nand a high barrier to entry.  (3) \nDo (1) and (2) so that the solution\ncan be delivered by software in a Web\nserver costing $2000-.  Then go live,\nget the revenue, grow the server \ncapacity, etc.  It&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying\nto do.  Current obstacle:  Windows\nand trying to use XCACLS and CACLS to\ndelete a file system directory that\ndoesn&#x27;t want to be deleted.  Previous\nobstacle:  Poor Microsoft documentation\nfor the differences between GUIDs and\nSqlGuids and how to convert between \nthem.  Previous obstacle:  A virus\nfrom the security problems with Flash\nand the fact that Windows doesn&#x27;t\nknow how to run malware safely.\nPrevious obstacle:  The fact that\nMicrosoft&#x27;s ASP.NET is much easier\nto work with when inserting Namespaces,\nDLLs, and source code than Visual Basic\n.NET.  Previous obstacles:  A long list\nmore from Microsoft.  The work uniquely\nmine has all been fast, fun, easy, without\ndelays.  But I&#x27;m getting past the Microsoft\nnonsense.<p>Problem sponsors at DoD, DARPA, and NSF\nare used to being able to evaluate projects\njust on paper with high batting average.\nApparently VCs don&#x27;t want to do any such\nthings.<p>> 80%<p>All the percentages on what arrives in\na VC&#x27;s in-box don&#x27;t mean much because\nwhat a VC has to find are exceptional\nprojects; that is, what the average\nproject is, or what most of the\nprojects are, is not very relevant --\nagain because what&#x27;s required are\nexceptional projects.  How exceptional?\nThere has been a claim by\nA16H that there are only about 15\nprojects a year worth a Series A.\nIf VCs would learn to read as well\nas, say, NSF problem sponsors, then there might be a few \nmore, not a lot yet, but a few.<p>A problem of information technology\nentrepreneur project &#x27;ideas&#x27; is that\nthey are usually just a short description\nof what the product/service does,\na description like might be given to\na prospective customer/user.  So, with\nsuch an &#x27;idea&#x27; and description, usually\nthere is no good way to evaluate it. \nE.g., how the heck, early on, to evaluate\nTwitter?  Twitter fails my (1) about\nsolving a big problem.  Since it was \nnot clear that Twitter would solve\na big problem, it was difficult to\nevaluate.<p>What is wanted for (1), for\nan extreme example,\nis, say, a safe, effective, cheap\none pill cure for any cancer -- there\nwe don&#x27;t have to wait for &#x27;traction&#x27;.<p>As in my (1), a &#x27;good&#x27; information\ntechnology project should have \nsignificant value as easy to \nsee.  And as for such a pill, want\nto stand on some research for\nan especially powerful, valuable\nsolution with barrier to entry.\nThe VCs just are not thinking this\nway.<p>It is quite possible for a person\nto be bright without education.\nIf the field they are working in,\ne.g., computing, doesn&#x27;t really\nrequire a lot of formal education,\nthen a person can be bright and\ngood in that field without formal\neducation.

For example, someone not knowing anything about our history may naturally assume that we started with monarchies then moved on to republics, etc. Only after reading about Rome would they see how messy it really was to get to where we are today.<p>Similarly, its easy to think that C was the &quot;first&quot; language, and then gradually we developed more dynamic ideas. But the reality is that C showed up 14 years after Lisp.<p>All this to say that if you want to truly understand &quot;where we&#x27;re going&quot;, you have to kind of understand that most the problems we are trying to &quot;fix&quot; are really &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;man made problems&quot; (from an engineering perspective that is). Making a program that runs on every architecture is not difficult. C++ wasn&#x27;t invented to solve this problem nor did it make things any easier in this department. The reason a program that runs on Mac doesn&#x27;t run on Windows is due to the fact that the companies that own the underlying systems don&#x27;t want them to (I suppose you could thus argue that the reason is that we allow laws to make this possible). Its not that Windows can&#x27;t handle drawing Macintosh looking buttons or something.<p>Yes, yes, its certainly the case that at some point it would have theoretically been annoying to ship a PPC bundle and an x86 bundle if the API problem would have magically not existed -- but the reality is that today basically everyone is running the same architecture for all intents and purposes (90+% of your consumer desktop base is on x86 and 90+% of your smartphone base is on ARM).<p>So the real problem now becomes making a program that runs on Linux/Mac/PC (or alternatively iOS/Android) that &quot;feels&quot; right on both. This remains an unsolved issue, and is arguably why Java failed. Java figured out the technical aspect just fine (again, it is NOT hard to make something that runs on any piece of metal), however, Java apps &quot;felt&quot; terrible. Similarly, Microsoft <i>correctly</i> understood that Java was a threat and hampered it. As you can see this has nothing to do with engineering.<p>So why is this not the case with JavaScript? Again, for no technical reason: the answer is purely cultural. The trick with JS was that it snuck in through the browser where two important coincidences took place:<p>1. People did&#x27;t have an existing expectation of homogeneity in the browser. It started as a place to post a bunch of documents, and so people got used to different websites looking different. No one complains if website A has different buttons or behaviors than website B, so as an accident of history developers were able to increasingly add functionality without complaints of a website &quot;not feeling right on Mac OS&quot;.<p>2. No large corporation was able to properly assess the danger of JS early enough to kill it. Again, since the web was a place for teens to make emo blogs, it wasn&#x27;t kept in check like Java was. Hell, <i>Microsoft</i> added XMLHttpRequest: arguably the most important component in the rise of web apps.<p>So now everything is about trying to leverage this existing foothold, that&#x27;s why we bend over backwards to get low level languages to compile into high level languages and so forth. Don&#x27;t try to think about it like a logical progression or how you would design the whole system from the ground up, just treat it more like a challenge or an unecessarily complex logic puzzle.",1387618626

6946277,comment,6945946,6945946,5,0,visakanv,,,"&quot;Dear Mr Cherian George,<p>1.      We refer to your 10 December commentary, “Online freedom: time to revise the Singapore report card”.<p>2.      The Breakfast Network was asked to register because it had ceased to be a personal blog or website, but had incorporated itself as the Breakfast Network Pte Ltd (BNPL). As a corporate entity, Breakfast Network Pte Ltd has a greater possibility of coming under foreign influence via foreign funding. This registration requirement is simply to ensure that Breakfast Network will not receive foreign funding.<p>3.      You declare that The Breakfast Network shut down due to “red tape” and “unnecessarily onerous registration”. We would like to clarify that this is not so. The Breakfast Network shut down because its editor and owner chose not to register, as required by MDA. Ms Henson claimed the requirements were onerous, citing the need to register volunteer contributors to her site. MDA issued a statement on 13 Dec 2013, refuting her claim. At no point was Ms Henson told that contributors needed to also register. She was only told that editors, including pro bono editors, had to register. As for the reporting of sources of revenue, MDA informed Ms Henson that she could suggest alternative ways of providing the required information.<p>4.      Secondly, nothing has changed for Internet Content Providers. They continue to operate and publish under the existing class licence framework which has been in place since 1996. Under this framework, certain groups such as political associations and political websites have always been required to register with the MDA.  However, up until now, the registration requirement did not come with an undertaking not to receive foreign funds.  This is because up until now, the political websites which had to register were also gazetted as political associations, which meant that they were already prohibited from receiving foreign funds under the Political Donations Act.<p>5.      You also characterise the registration process as an exercise for the Breakfast Network to “persuade regulators they deserve the right to publish before they are allowed to do so”. This is an astounding description. The registration merely requires the provision of names of persons involved in the provision, management and/or operation of the Breakfast Network, and an undertaking by them not to receive foreign funding.<p>6.      Our internet regulations have not changed.  Neither has our long standing principle that politics should remain a matter for Singaporeans and Singapore only.&quot;<p>- <a href=\"http://blog.freedomfromthepress.info/2013/12/10/online-freedom-time-to-revise-the-singapore-report-card/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.freedomfromthepress.info/2013/12/10/online-freed...</a>",1387618520

It was not at all obvious to me that you were trying to point out the problem of induction, and if you were, then I would suggest that you haven&#x27;t actually understood it, or rather, its consequences.<p>I think there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the argument for the problem of induction - but you have to realize that philosophically, there is no distinction there between the inductive conclusion that there is a big bang or evolution or bacteria or electromagnetism ... and the inductive conclusion that there is a sun. &quot;The sun&quot; and its associated properties and predictions are also pure induction and thus equally vulnerable to the problem of induction. And even more mundane things like the assumption that there are people out there and that there is a supermarket out there and that the bread that they sell you is not poisonous and ... - they are all inductive results. The problem of induction thus postulates that they are all equally problematic. See also solipsism.<p>The problem with your arguments is that you make an arbitrary distinction between things you supposedly &quot;observe directly&quot; and things that are &quot;only derived inductively&quot;, which you do not justify (and which is not justified by the problem of induction), and which I would suggest is actually not justifiable, and what I am criticizing are the inconsistencies resulting from that. My best guess is that you need some more scientific background to see clearer why that distinction is arbitrary.",1387618187

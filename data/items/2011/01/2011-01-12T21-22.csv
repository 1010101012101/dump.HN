It's an uncanny valley experience.  I can only imagine what it's going to be like when _translation_ experiences the same increase in performance and accuracy.<p>BTW - the entire point of Kurzweil's writing, and ""singularity"" thesis is precisely that the last 500+ years of technological growth are all building on each other, and a 20% growth next year is incomparable to what 20% growth was 100 years ago, presuming we had year over year growth of 20% in terms of our information processing capability.<p>We can argue if it's 30%/year, 20% year, or 10% year - but the reality is that as long as it's 10% plus (which I think every resident of HN would agree is a conservative predictor for future technological growth for the next 20 years), the curve gets freaky very soon.<p>Kurzweil isn't interesting in terms of the precision and absolute accuracy of his predictions - which I'll agree with you, he is overly generous - but in terms of the ""class"" of advances he is predicting.<p>Basically, anything that can be translated (pardon the pun. :-) into a ""Information Processing Domain"" - is going to be radically transformed in terms of performance, personalization, and miniaturization.<p>He predicted, when it was _not_ obvious - that we would have phones that would be able to translate our conversations, right around now.<p>So, I find his prediction about things like ""nanotechnological blood and organ analysis in 20 years"" to be pretty darn interesting.",1294869549

First of all, from the article:<p>""It costs only US$6.50 per unit to assemble all parts and components into a ready to use iPhone. The assembly cost accounts for merely 3.6% of the total manufacturing cost.""<p>So the Chinese company <i>assembles</i> (not produces) units for $6.50 a piece, which is only a tiny fraction of the total manufacturing cost. The other $180.55 of the cost of manufacturing comes largely from American countries.<p>And no, the article is <i>not</i> saying it's unfair that we can't take that last $7. In fact, just the opposite. It's lamenting the fact that most trade deficit calculations use the <i>entire manufacturing cost</i> (~$190 in this case) rather than just taking into account the value added ($6.50) by the exporting country. Calculating the figure this way makes the situation seem much more dire than it actually is, which results in extremist cries for a trade war. The author of this paper seems to think the $7 of value added by China is perfectly fair, and he's just trying to get others to realize that this figure is more accurate and applicable than the standard calculation.",1294869286

The idea of Earth having resources that would make it necessary (or even feasible) to go through all the trouble and mine this planet is simply not viable. In fact, it's horribly dangerous for any alien civilization to come here for this purpose. Pretty much every ounce of material on this planet is contaminated with self-replicating organisms that would wreak havoc on any foreign ecosystem.<p>There are still some nefarious reasons why an outside civilization may attack us, for example to bolster a slavery-based economy or for religious purposes. There are certainly other reasons we can't even think of yet. But resources? No.<p>Territorial reasons are also void, since we can't project any meaningful power beyond close earth orbit and we couldn't even mount a serious planetary defense come to think of it.

Lets say you happen to have 3000::0 IPv6 network completely unused, which also fits the entire IPv4 address space. Then you could configure your DNS server to respond to AAAA queries for domains that have only A records with an corresponding IPv6 in your free block. Ie news.ycombinator.com(174.132.225.106) would become 3000::ae84:e16a or something like that. Then your router which is default gw for the hosts receives a package destined to that special network, it takes the payload and puts it into a IPv4 packet with destination decoded from the IPv6 address.<p>It seems kinda obvious approach, wouldn't require any modification of the hosts or to the internet. Of course I don't know why anyone would want to run a IPv6 only LAN instead of mixed v4/v6, but maybe there is some reason to. Are there some problems that I haven't noticed? Surely someone must have thought about this before.",1294868971

2097874,comment,2097595,2097684,0,0,patio11,,,"[edit: Had coffee, thought sardonic voice could be misconstrued, rephrased.]<p>The calculation of national trade deficit is a matter of strategic import at a number of Japanese companies, which have scale sufficient that companywide policy registers on them.  (I live in Japan's manufacturing heartland, and work professionally in the ambit of a particular company which makes, among other things, automobiles.  That company is, to say things mildly, rather large.)<p>Back in the 1980s, when the US/Japan trade deficit was a source of friction between the two countries, there was great popular unrest in the US about it, including demonstrations where Japanese cars were destroyed to make a point.  This unrest predictably had concrete policy consequences.  Those policy consequences materially impacted the operations of several large Japanese companies, including that automobile manufacturer.<p>So they put their heads together with the PR teams and hacked the system.  One hack was sharply curtailing the amount of final assembly they do.  As I phrased it once, a Japanese chasis, Japanese camera, Japanese CPU, Japanese antenna, Japanese software, and Chinese paper box is a Chinese cell phone when the governments run their numbers.  Journalists and politicians don't second guess them, because they're mostly ignorant.  This keeps anti-Japan unrest to a minimum and is part of the reason why economic relations between the countries are so cordial now despite fairly little materially changing.<p>Japan historically has a contentious relationship with China.  A portion of the discontent with globalism which was once directed at Japan is now directed at China.  Many here would consider this to not be a bug.",1294868956

There are a number of research projects that are starting to make progress in this area.<p>2015 We will have universal dictionary lookup capability for most languages, and will have word-word translation in spoken, clearly written (handwriting AI is a long ways off - I'll make no predictions there), read, and listened to language.  We will also have the capability to convert between all four (Write down a word in English, have it displayed and spoken out in French)<p>2020 will be the year that we'll start to see reasonably good translation systems that take into account some amount of nuance beyond word-for-word translation.

I thought his recent evaluation of predictions was weak.<p>First off, this particular technology could probably have been built, very badly, in the early 90s.  It would have had accuracy too low to make it useful.
Its cool that google are doing this now, certainly, but the questions on accuracy and speed need to be answered.  I'm sure they'll do a good job, but my point is that there is a big difference than when the technology is first prototyped in a lab, in some form, and when its mature enough for wide spread consumption.
The predictions really need to say which they are referring to to be meaningful - a big problem with the recent evaluation.<p>Further, if your thesis is that technological capacity grows exponentially, like moores law, then 8/10 years wrong is pretty wrong.<p>Finally, I'll just say, that the charts of progress and development in the book 'The Singlularity Is Near' are hard to take seriously.  Subjective technological milestones are arbitrarily chosen, sometimes over millennial timespans. These are plotted log-log, lines are fitted and inferences drawn that make predictions on for the next 30 years.  What's the margin of error to a methodology like that?<p>I'm not disagreeing with any particular thesis; his writing certain stirs healthy debate on important ideas, and its certainly worth pointing out to a whole lot of people that technological growth is non-linear.<p>But beyond that, I'm not paying too much attention to the future predictions.",1294867980

The OP didn't state ""Mayer must be incompetent because she's a woman"", but that's not how sexism works--people perpetuate sexism by allowing sexist attitudes to color their judgments about the merits of individiuals, often subconsciously.  Why do I think it is reasonable to ascribe sexist attitudes to the OP?  Because the OP is willing to presume incompetence of an engineer a) without evidence (""I can picture it now..."") and b) in the face of substantial evidence to the contrary (the alarming success of GOOG), when the only atypical characteristic of said engineer is that she's a woman.",1294866474

840537,comment,840317,840521,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Well, there's the Unix distro package system <i>and</i> another repository for Ruby gems <i>and</i> CPAN <i>and</i> LuaRocks <i>and</i> Hackage and ... They keep stepping on each others' toes, but I'm not sure the solution is to add even more mutually incompatible packaging systems. By their nature, they need to see the system (inc. what dependencies are available) as a whole to be really useful, and fragmenting that picture makes the situation worse for all involved. (On second reading, it looks like it's designed to try to work with CPAN et al, so that's an improvement.)<p>It would be nice if it actually worked, but coming up with a perfectly portable global packaging system would be hard enough if it was working across platforms for one vendor, let alone the big mob that is the open source world.",1253761170

The first few weeks was difficult but it got significantly easier as I got more fit.  I've hit my goal of getting to and from work in less time then the train.<p>My motivation lately has been to keep up and pass the numerous mopeds and scooters.  What really gets me going is trying to keep up with cyclists on road racing bicycles.  I really don't have much of a chance on the my hybrid (cross between a commuter and mountain bicycle + electric assist to 24km/h) but it's always a happy day when I pass the slower road racers.  It must motivate them too because they will try to keep pace but eventually fade away after a few kilometers.<p>The other motivation is thrill of speed on the downhill sections.  Another area I seem to have an advantage as the road racers seem to top out at 40km/h.

I know many bright people who are into the edgier scenes, and most of them are the sorts of people who took the SATs too hungover to read the tests in front of them. So the test only works if you're willing to say that everybody puts equal effort into the SATs.<p>I also think it's hilarious that ""classic rocks"" includes Queen, AC/DC, Elton John, and Bob Dylan.

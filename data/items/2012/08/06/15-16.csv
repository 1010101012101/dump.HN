4345690,comment,4344984,4345055,6,0,Zak,,,"I actually found the removal of the floppy drive to be rather premature. It took several years for any of the currently popular alternatives to reach critical mass for most people. It wasn't reasonable to assume, for example that Internet access would be available on a computer you wanted to bring a file to. USB flash drives weren't available (or at least cheap and common), and it was more likely than not that a destination computer wouldn't be able to read one.<p>I knew a lot of people with Macs in the late '90s, and most of them bought USB floppy drives.",1344268798
4345689,comment,4345289,4345582,14,0,aphyr,,,"<i>The idea of having a primary language honestly comes off to me as a sign that the developer hasn't spent much time programming yet: the real world has so many languages in it, and many times the practical choice is constrained by that of the platform or existing code to interoperate with.</i><p>I've been writing code for ~18 years, ~10 professionally. I've programmed in (chronological order here) Modula-2, C, Basic, the HTML constellation, Perl, XSLT, Ruby, PHP, Java, Mathematica, Prolog, C++, Python, ML, Erlang, Haskell, Clojure, and Scala. I can state unambiguously that Clojure is my primary language: it is the most powerful, the most fun, and has the fewest tradeoffs.<p>Like Haskell, I view Clojure as an apex language: the best confluence of software ideas towards a unified goal. Where Haskell excels at lazy, pure, strongly typed problems, Clojure is my first choice for dynamic, general-purpose programming. I wish it were faster, that it had a smarter compiler, that it had CPAN's breadth, that its error messages were less malevolent, that it had a strong type system for some problems. But for all this, you gain a fantastically expressive, concise, rich language built out of strikingly few ideas which lock together beautifully. It gives you a modern build system, a REPL, hot code reloading, hierarchies, parametric polymorphism, protocols, namespaces, immediate, lazy, logical, object-oriented, and functional modes, rich primitives, expressive syntax, immutable and mutable containers, many kinds of concurrency, thoughtful Java integration, hygenic and anaphoric macros, and homoiconicity.<p>Were Clojure to cease, I would immediately endeavor to replicate its strengths in another language. That's a primary language to me. ;-)",1344268783

Since upstream is fast enough the service is going to be indistinguishable from something like dropbox in terms of speed and I will have full control.<p>The issues here are data and power reliability , what happens if the disk in my home server dies? There is only so much redundancy you can cram into a small low cost box. I guess the solution would be third party backup services that take advantage of fast upstream to sync the contents of your local box and perhaps can also perform as a ""failover"" box if your local node fails. The difference here is that you would get a choice of third party backup suppliers, though I imagine most ISPs would provide this as part of the broadband service.<p>One thing that does concern me somewhat on HN and other development oriented websites is that people do a lot of talking about stuff like APIs and Web services rather than protocols and standards. \nWeb APIs provide the illusion of data portability since you have some way of interacting with it, but the reality is that you need a way to dump <i>all</i> of your data and you also need 100% compatible software to move it to.<p>I guess it's difficult to make a business case for designing Email 2.0 unless you know that you can monetise users through some kind of lock-in. Otherwise you could design a fantastic open service only to have someone copy it , undercut you on price and steal all of your users. For example if you could set up your own third party ""facebook server"" that allows users to interact with FB users without agreeing to facebook TOS or seeing facebook ads.",1344267711

This is required because I do work on a mobile application targeting iOS, Android, and ""the browser"" that has a server part and native components on the clients (using a mix of custom and off-the-shelf open-source codebases).<p>So, what is my ""primary language""? I'd simply argue I don't have one, and I haven't had one for a decade. The idea of having a primary language honestly comes off to me as a sign that the developer hasn't spent much time programming yet: the real world has so many languages in it, and many times the practical choice is constrained by that of the platform or existing code to interoperate with.<p>The question about what language I used just prior to adopting Clojure is also not going to work very well: it was probably bash, as I used that language to download and setup Clojure. It may have been something like Haskell, as I might have been in an experimenting mood that day. It could have been any of the above ""used"" set (as I probably just had ""learn Clojure"" on my todo list right after something else random). The result of that version of the question doesn't really have meaning.<p>A much better question might be, ""for the tasks that you find yourself now using Clojure, what language do you now feel you are most using less often?"" (although spending some more time on the poor ""most/less"" phrasing that I left in that might cause problems with non-English speakers). This question better handles people who are long past the idea that they primarily code in some specific language.<p>It also lets you answer the question more precisely: a person even working in only two languages, JavaScript (client, 70%) and Python (server, 30%) who started using Clojure on the server as a replacement for his current usage of Python is a different kind of user than the person who started using ClojureScript on the client as a replacement for his current usage of JavaScript.",1344267084

It doesn't work like that 100%  of the time but it's a consistent basic rule of humanity.<p><i>""the first world simply steals Africa's wealth""</i><p>Simply steals it? The wealth of an entire continent? That's unsubstantiated rhetoric used to simplify a complex problem to American viewers. Many African nations have mineral deposits, land, even diamonds. But don't have wealth because they lack the ingredients to harness the power of their natural resources. Historians have studied America for a long time to try to determine how out of all the world's nations, the West has dominated. It's influence, it's money, it's language, it's ideas, inventions, and culture are everywhere. Why not China? Why not Europe? Historians boiled it down to more or less 5 things. With Land Ownership being one of the most important things that leads towards a democracy and free market. Advancement in Science, freedom of expression & religion, follow afterward. Even countries that are growing in power and influence are doing so by mimicking the values that got the West where it is. Land ownership + Freedom of expression + consumerism + free markets + Scientific, educational, and technological advancements.<p>Land ownership and democracy go hand in hand. ""Up to 90% of sub-Saharan Africa's land area is currently untitled. Without legal owners, this land falls to the state, which makes it easy to lease to foreign investors"". The whole point of a democracy is to make it difficult for dictators to make massive decisions affecting an entire country. Without land ownership in Africa all you have to do is bribe one or two officials to get massive amounts of land. If Africa had stronger land ownership rights this would not be possible. Land would be sold by the owner with it's owner benefiting from the sale. Thus giving locals power and the ability to accrue wealth. Instead the people of a land work to maintain and live off of it but can lose it through no fault of their own due to a decision by someone they don't even know.<p>""<i>a more traditional 'communal' view of the land has been associated with a broader and deeper connection with the land, and a healthier sense of custodianship.</i>""<p>You're thinking of the Native Americans from hundreds of years ago before the industrial revolution and consumerism. That doesn't work anymore, Neither in country nor continent. The poorest countries in the world use the communal land system. And it's that system that keeps them poor. They can't build or sell anything because they don't own anything to begin with.",1344266601

(ES here stands for ""embedded systems"") Concurrently with OpenGL 4.3, Khronos also released OpenGL ES 3.0, the update for the spec which can reasonably expected to guide a later version of WebGL. On my reading, OpenGL ES 3.0 does not seem to require a comparable level of data safety.<p>The security aspects of the interaction between GPU code and HTML clients are all well-addressed by the current WebGL spec. Which particular concerns are you talking about?<p>One possibility where the new OpenGL 4.3 requirements might help is in current desktop WebGL implementations which translate WebGL (which is OpenGL ES) to OpenGL (the desktop). But WebGL is sometimes translated to OpenGL, sometimes to Direct3D via ANGLE, sometimes to OpenGL ES directly. Finally, relatively few desktop drivers actually implement the latest OpenGL spec anyway; OS X does not even have OpenGL 4.2 yet, despite being out for a long while now.<p>All this is to say that 1) I don't believe the new requirements will have no immediate impact on WebGL security and 2) WebGL buffer security is a non-issue (whether WebGL clients crash the video drivers or not is a different story).",1344266043

The woman who owned the store was trying to offload all of her turquoise during peak tourist season, so she set the price a lot lower than normal. Although this was the most popular sell typically, fewer people started buying thus having the reverse effect of what she wanted. She relocated the stones' showcase to the front and center of the store. Sales plummeted further.<p>As she left for a short vacation, she left a note for one of her employees to drop the price to half of what it already was, and at least try to make a little bit of money back. But the employee misread the note and accidentally <i>doubled</i> the price of the turquoise. By the time the store owner got back, the rocks had sold out, at DOUBLE the price.<p>The store owner contacted the author of the book, a psychologist (I forget why) and he explained the reasoned this may have happened. Most of her customers were affluent and wealthy tourists who had been under the subconscious impression that you get what you pay for. When they saw high-priced stones, they knew that they were getting quality stones, at least that's what they had been led to believe through years of dealings.<p>This is why this guy's experiment will work and is a great idea. He is probably no more skilled than many of the hackers on here, but he stands out with his exorbitant price tag and some companies figure, 'hey, you get what you pay for.'

If the entire Mac user body moves to XQuartz, it's best for that to happen quickly.<p>Apple has a well established history of quickly (some might say ruthlessly) depreciating and moving OS components and APIs forward. The upside of this is that developers don't have to experience the anguish associated with supporting several versions of sub-system for long. OS upgrades for the Mac are cheap and easy, so users tend to run closer to the front line. This is especially true for developers.<p>The downside is that you're frequently caught off guard. The change from Apple X11 to XQuartz is, definitively, a yak shaving exercise. Bleh.<p>The approach isn't without trade-offs.

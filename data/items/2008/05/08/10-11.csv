184372,comment,184328,184328,0,0,jhancock,,,"I've recently been through this decision process.  I had v1.0 of <a href=""http://shellshadow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shellshadow.com</a> using mysql.  I ran into one bug in my assumption about how mysql was handling unique constraints and from there started to look at postgres again.\nIt turned out my decision to move to postgres, which I put in production last month, was more about timing of pfg 8.3 coming to maturity than absolutes against mysql.<p>Here are a few points that tipped things to postgres.\n1 - constraints and complex queries.  MySql handles simple selects fast but has somewhat unpredictable behavior on complex queries.  Including counts.  Postgres generally scales in proportion to complexity of the query well.\n2 - Postgres 8.3 came out.  This was a big deal as it cleans up lots of things that want into 8.x. \n3 - BSD-style engineering.  Everything from docs to source code to make files is more rigorous with old school BSD projects.  FreeBSD and Postgres are clean!!!  I don't want to hammer on linux, GNU, GPL stuff too much, but to be honest, this camp is stable because of massive user base and companies put in effort to make it stable.  Its a sledgehammer approach.  In general I find projects like FreeBSD and Postgres to follow more rigid engineering processes.  I like this in my DB ;)\n4 - Full Text Search built into postgres 8.3.  MySQL has FTS, sort of.  Postgres prior to 8.3 had it as an add-on.  You can run external Full Text Search engines like lucene or \n ferret or maybe even better, sphinx.  But this adds one more ""engine"" to manage.  Most real world FTS use cases needs to have its results filtered in context of user prefs and have results filtered and sorted by other DB criteria.  This means that for many FTS use cases, it is very desirable to just give the DB one big complex query and have it return things all sorted out.  Using an external FTS system, you usually end up taking your FTS results and going back to the DB for further queries to filter and sort the FTS results.  This adds to app code complexity.  With postgres 8.3, you can do this in ways that MySQL cannot begin to compete with.<p>Hope these rational help.  I am very happy with my decision to switch from MySQL to postgres and the process was not painful.<p>good luck, Jon\nwww.shellshadow.com",1210244177
184371,comment,183303,184341,0,0,natrius,,,"My concern isn't really with it causing bugs in my code; it's more with trying to decipher other people's code and making their lives easier when they have to read mine. I was skeptical about chaining at first too, but it all seems nice except for .end().<p>The speed question is because I don't know how jQuery actually goes about selecting elements. For example, with 'div.entry', I presume it does something like a getElementsByTagName('div'), then iterates through those to find the ones that have class 'entry'. If jQuery stores that somewhere and .end() has some sort of magic to get the precomputed list back that $() itself doesn't, I thought it might be slower. The method you showed avoids that, but at the cost of precious, precious keystrokes. I guess I'll just poke around in the code at some point to see what's going on.",1210244008

184369,comment,184325,184355,0,0,rms,,,"I think this situation would work out fine if it weren't for the unknown group members -- it seems likely that the OP and his friend with the lawyer dad are on good enough terms to make it work. I get the impression that the other group members don't really care about the project, because they aren't putting up the money to hire the OP. But if the project becomes successful, they could truthfully claim that they were involved with the project from the start.<p>It doesn't sound like anyone wants to be overly legalistic; it sounds like someone's father is an aggressive lawyer type that saw an opportunity to negotiate the best possible terms. The OP and his partners need to draft some type of agreement. I don't think there is any need to involve lawyers immediately, wait until you incorporate. For now, just get something on paper you all agree with. Send it to friend's lawyer dad to legalize if you so desire. Get a free corporate registration and registered agent from him if you can. Only a Delaware C corp.",1210243897

The company I'm freelancing for keeps buying programs which look like they were designed by a monkey (eg, clipart icons, garish colours, poor alignment of elements, graphics <i>literally</i> done in MS Paint) and nobody except me seems to give a damn. If your product is a good one, don't sweat the design too much. If people use it and like it, you can enhance the design later.",1210242862

184356,comment,184325,184325,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"If you're going to be heading in to any kind of adversarial situation involving contracts, then you're probably already outmatched; your roommate will go to his dad, and then whether you've drawn up your own contract or purchased one or consulted with an attorney of your own, you'll still be staring down the barrel of a lawyer whose son is involved. Lawyers love nothing more than billable hours, except presumably your roommate will getting a pretty healthy chunk of them for free.<p>So, I don't think you can make this work out.<p>But, if you wanted to try anyway, I'd suggest drawing up your own contract as a counter-offer. They aren't hard to write, and they don't have to be long. They just have to describe, in very plain language, what work you'll perform, what you expect to receive in return, and what to do if things don't work out.",1210241846

(S)he hasn't signed over the copyright, and there is no mention of it having been discussed in the verbal agreement. And the bulk of it was copy and pasted. The 'customers' cannot copyright the idea, although they may have explicitly stated that part of the discussion consisted of trade secrets.<p>This is rather different from the Facebook case, where there was pre-existing code when Zuckerberg was engaged.<p>If the father really thinks it's a valuable proposition, it's in his interest to clean up the intellectual property situation sooner rather than later. I'd have a friendly word with them to say you think the whole project is much more likely to succeed if you've got equity as well. Once you've got an agreement on terms that you all feel are fair, that's the time to get the lawyers to put it into writing.<p>If they really want to get all legalistic on you, first think whether you want to be in business with them, second you could suggest that they pay your costs to hire your own lawyer.",1210241812

184351,comment,184345,184345,0,0,maxwell,,,"I'm a borderline young person, so I guess I can comment. Good aesthetics and good content seem circular. If a site looks good, I'm probably more inclined to look around, bookmark it, or contribute to the content. Conversely, if the content's good on its own, that might give it the popularity that spurs some visual improvement. A lot of popular sites weren't particularly pretty when they launched/grew (take Facebook), and some still aren't. But if it's a user-driven site, people might be less inclined to contribute information or come back in the first place if its ugly. So, I generally try not to separate the two in my own work.

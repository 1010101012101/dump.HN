There are all sorts of</i> possible <i>dangers and warnings, but the markets indicate that there is a real, tangible need that's not going away.</i><p>The environmental dangers of oil drilling are more than possibilities, and your dismissive tone doesn’t aid your argument.  The current supporters of increased off-shore drilling are spinning up its positives and spinning down its negatives as a craven political ploy in an election year which coincides with oil prices higher than they were a few years ago, and general economic instability.<p>Off-shore drilling is not going to solve our current economic crisis, nor is it going to bring down oil prices to any substantial degree—maybe the price will dip a few percent in 10 years when the oil starts flowing.<p>> <i>Hey. I can pay for gas at 20 bucks a gallon. Not crazy about it, but I'm not letting it change my behavior. The people impacted are third world countries -- mostly the poor.</i><p>Your implication is that off-shore oil-drilling in America is the best way to help the third-world poor.  That is absurd. (And hyperbolically casting natrius as some kind of heartless first-world imperialist doesn’t help your argument either.  It makes your comments seem like trolling.)",1218398214

I won't use the term ""straw man"" but I'd at least like to humbly suggest you've made a whole slew of assumptions about what might or might not happen. Most of these I take issue with.<p>I'm not crazy about oil. Personally, I'll be happy when we're off it. But, like I said, I don't sit around taking my personal feelings and try to control world markets with them. Seems kind of, well, presumptuous. If we can drill for oil offshore, and it's there, and we need it, I say have at it. There are all sorts of _possible_ dangers and warnings, but the markets indicate that there is a real, tangible need that's not going away.<p>Hey. I can pay for gas at 20 bucks a gallon. Not crazy about it, but I'm not letting it change my behavior. The people impacted are third world countries -- mostly the poor. I would think that ""screwing the poor to make the world a more pretty place for me"" wouldn't be much of anything to be proud of.<p>Note that I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, just trying to figure out where the limits of your argument lie.

272521,comment,272403,272498,0,0,natrius,,,"""Seems like a terrible waste of American's lives just in order to make the culture more to your liking.""<p>He clearly said that the goal was energy independence, not a change in culture. The change in culture is a means to that end.<p>Drilling offshore now isn't worth the potential environmental damage or the sacrifice of the future value of that oil when it becomes more scarce. I don't think that oil is enough to tide us over until we don't need oil anymore, especially since the oil will be sold on the global market. It will barely lower oil prices in a decade. Are those sacrifices worth it? I don't think so.<p>With or without new offshore drilling, we will lower our energy consumption by necessity from now until we're off of oil. It will be too expensive to continue on our current course. The current focus should be on solutions that will make that transition period less painful, not on solutions that will make us use more oil and further our dependency on it.<p>I agree with you on all the nuclear stuff.",1218396973

272517,comment,272403,272510,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"So your position, and I see you have a doe report, is that ""drilling for oil does not help oil prices""<p>The nice part about this is, once you accept the logic (or lack thereof) it makes total sense why we haven't drilled in the last 30 years. You see? Drilling for oil doesn't help supply any. Why if we had drilled 30 years ago we'd still be in the same situation we are today.<p>I wonder if the doe could make some estimates on other commodity prices 30 years into the future.

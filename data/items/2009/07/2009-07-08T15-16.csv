you no longer have trouble selling it to a random person in Best Buy.<p>The average person rarely understands the difference between an operating system, a browser and a search engine.  And they're almost all pretty skeptical of FOSS, even after you explain it.<p>But most know, like and trust Google.  And they know Google is fast and free.  So when the Best Buy flunkie says it does the internet super-fast and the battery lasts longer, they're inclined to believe.  There are no new concepts for them to tackle.<p>The up-side of a Google Operating System vs any other Linux distro doesn't really go to the user.  It goes to the netbook vendor, who now has a far easier time moving Windows-less product and thus a stronger position when dealing with Microsoft.<p>Also, OS fragmentation is the logical end result of the web.  The OS is still relevant, but it's not the main draw.  So there's a lot of room for innovation, specialization and competition.<p>It's A Good Thing.",1247068433

694056,comment,693861,693982,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think that maybe I've put my arguments forward in a bad way. I'll try from a different angle.<p>In business strategy there's a concept called complementary products. A complementary product is one that is one that makes your product more valuable the cheaper it is. Cars and gasoline is an example of this. Servers and software is another. The cheaper gasoline is, the more valuable a car is. The good strategy is to commoditize your complements, thus driving down price. This will put more value into your product. For instance, if you run Google you make software. Your interest is to comoditize servers, thus driving the price down. This makes your business more valuable because your complement has been commoditized. Indeed, this is exactly what Google is doing when they use standard boxes in large arrays instead of buying Sun servers.<p>My argument in the blogpost is similar. If Google can remove as many obstacles as possible, and commoditize their complementary products they will win. This is exactly what they are doing with this move. They are forcing their competitors into making a product that will make Google money. Google doesn't care (financially at least) about browsers and operating systems. They make their money on online apps and marketing. Their strategy is to make it as easy as possible to get online and use their services. The argument is underpinned by the fact that both are open sourced. They won't make Google any money directly, but they'll help tremendously in commoditizing OS'es and browsers.<p>Joel Spolsky has a post about omplementary products that explains the concept much better than I can ever hope to do: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html</a>",1247067457

(the real component)<p>- if I know extra information (eg: that I added a .001L) about the size does that information say that the actual size is going to be > or < the size I perceive it to be (the ""infinitesimal"" component)<p>...and it's not unreasonable that for ad-hoc, intuitive reasoning the mind would (roughly speaking) make the ""correct"" adjustments when combining size measurements (eg: (x + delta) + y > x + y, (x + delta) + (y + delta) > x + y + delta, (x + delta) + (y - delta) 'is a wash between' x + y, etc.)...after all even babies and animals apparently can do simple sums intuitively/automatically.",1247067372

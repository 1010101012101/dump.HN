During and after lunch the topic of the name for the Lisp came up, and such obvious names as NIL and SPICE Lisp were proposed and rejected—as giving too much credit to one group and not enough to others—and such non-obvious names as Yu-Hsiang Lisp were also proposed and reluctantly rejected.<p>> The name felt to be best was “Standard Lisp,” but another dialect was known by that name already. In searching for similar words, the name “Common Lisp” came up. Gabriel remarked that this wasn’t a good name because we were trying to define an Elitist Lisp, and “Common Lisp” sounded too much like “Common Man Lisp.”<p>> The naming discussion resumed at dinner at the Pleasure Bar, an Italian restaurant in another Pittsburgh district, but no luck was had by all.<p>> Later in E-mail, Moon referred to “whatever we call this common Lisp,” and this time, amongst great sadness and consternation that a better name could not be had, it was selected.",1409918020

In fact, it tends to decrease latency and reduce nausea. In the limit, reality has an essentially-infinite frame rate and doesn&#x27;t cause nausea.<p>When low frame rates seem choppy, that&#x27;s normally because there&#x27;s a mismatch between frame rate and display refresh. GSync/freesync fix that to make things smooth even when the frame rate drops. Choppiness can also be due to the impulse response; technologies with a bright and short apparent pulse (CRT, Plasma, some OLED) will show better &#x27;motion&#x27; than those that display and hold (LCD, some OLED).",1409918007

Currently I&#x27;m using LastPass + a usb drive of gpg private subkeys (mostly online) + print outs of revocation keys + another usb key with the master key (only use offline)<p>What software are you using?<p>e.g.: 1Password, KeePass, LastPass, gpg -d passwords.txt | grep ycombinator, dropbox with stealmystuff.txt..<p>What hardware are you using?<p>USB keys, yubikey, mobile phone 2fa, paper and pen, printers.<p>Just curious what the current best practices are, and what things have worked on the longest timescales.<p>[0]: https://git-annex.branchable.com/",1409914825

5506365,comment,5506093,5506093,5,0,beloch,,,"Wilson's point is not that math/stats aren't necessary for most research.  They <i>are</i>.  He admits it.  Instead, he argues that there is an ample supply of math/stats researchers to collaborate with, so you can get by in science being mathematically illiterate.  I disagree.<p>As a grad student, I did work in experimental quantum physics.  Emphasis on experimental.  There were only a handful of places on Earth where theorists could go to test the sort of stuff we could do in the lab.  In a very specific corner of scientific knowledge, we were the choke point.  We collaborated with theorists from all over the world.  Many of them could do things on paper that I could barely understand.  I had to understand them to test them though, and they helped me greatly.  I'd be rather disappointed in Wilson if he was happy to test theories he couldn't understand!<p>I think the message shouldn't be that ""there are people to do math/stats for you if you want to do science"".  Perhaps you could get by that way, and perhaps Wilson has been able to con people into thinking he's good when he's testing things he doesn't understand.  That takes a completely different skillset than math/stats I suppose, but I don't find it admirable.<p>Perhaps a better message is that you don't have to be a hardcore theorist to contribute to scientific research.  You need to be able to understand what you're doing, but you don't need to be a genius who covers every surface around him in incomprehensible symbols while gibbering to himself gleefully.  (Yes, these people do exist, and they are sometimes <i>awesome</i> to have around.)  Theorists are just one kind of scientist.  Experimentalists are every bit as important, but their skill set is different.  Theorists can wave their hands and make assumptions when solving problems.  Experimentalists have to think things through very pedantically because assumptions usually bite them in the ass. Theorists can tackle a different problem every day and move between wildly disparate fields on a whim.  Experimenalists have to stick with one problem for months or years at a time.  Experimental work involves a lot of craft and patience.<p>So no, you don't need to be a mathematical genius to be a scientist, but I wouldn't want to be an experimentalist who can't understand what he's doing!",1365317969

5506302,comment,5506093,5506185,11,0,a_p,,,"Perhaps you haven't heard about the doctor who rediscovered the trapezoid rule and had his article published in a respected, peer reviewed biology journal in 1994.[1] The paper is called ""A mathematical model for the determination of total area under glucose tolerance and other metabolic curves""  and it got 75 citations (as of 2007). EDIT: Google Scholar lists 178 citations now [].
The abstract:<p>""OBJECTIVE To develop a mathematical model for the determination of total areas under curves from various metabolic studies.<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In Tai's Model, the total area under a curve is computed by dividing the area under the curve between two designated values on the X-axis (abscissas) into small segments (rectangles and triangles) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas. The total sum of these individual areas thus represents the total area under the curve. Validity of the model is established by comparing total areas obtained from this model to these same areas obtained from graphic method Gess than 0.4%). Other formulas widely applied by researchers under- or overestimated total area under a metabolic curve by a great margin.<p>RESULTS Tai's model proves to be able to 1) determine total area under a curve with precision; 2) calculate area with varied shapes that may or may not intercept on one or both X/Y axes; 3) estimate total area under a curve plotted against varied time intervals (abscissas), whereas other formulas only allow the same time interval; and 4) compare total areas of metabolic curves produced by different studies.<p>CONCLUSIONS The Tai model allows flexibility in experimental conditions, which means, in the case of the glucose-response curve, samples can be taken with differing time intervals and total area under the curve can still be determined with precision.""<p>More information about it is available here. [2]<p>EDIT: I just looked at the full article and it is more bizarre than I had anticipated. For one, it says that ""three formulas have been developed to calculate the total area under a curve"", and then lists the works in which the formulas are given. One of the works listed is Irving Adler's <i>A New Look at Geometry</i>, which is a math book accessible to readers with a high school education (it's good book by the way  the MAA has given it a rating of BLL [3]). But Adler's name is misspelled ""Alder"" in the article and in the citation. The author also gives credit to a doctor at Yale for ""his expert review"".

For example, if you'd been able to send, say, 50 bytes of 8085 code to the VT-100, and use a 30-character buffer, you could have handled backspace locally in the terminal, both improving responsiveness and dramatically lowering load on your VAX back in the days when handling an I/O interrupt to echo a character was a substantial load.  If the VT-100 or H19 had had 20 bytes of SRAM mapped into its font ROM space, you could have had four programmable glyphs  enough to display a pixel-positioned mouse pointer on top of the text, or really dramatically spice up a lot of video games of the time.

It is no more assignments you get functional, or in the case of PhD's mostly throw-away software/hacks that does something for your thesis. This is what I mean by skills that I need. Taking a bunch of random classes is nice for you, but none of them teach you how to write code or design systems in the business world. At least bachelor degrees only have ~4 years of bad coding behind them, and they have all of the fundamentals at that point necessary to be great software developers.

Then I used a layer mask on the top layer with a grid pattern to mix the two images. The saved image was a mix of the relatively normal Tux pixels and the bright GNU pixels.<p>The final touch was editing the gAMA value in the PNG.

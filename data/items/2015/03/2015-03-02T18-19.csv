The strings that are attached are strings for people who want to sell...<p>Many open source projects do something like this, a dual license where the source code for the project is GPL, but the creator is willing to license it for something as non-gpl to people unwilling to release their source code.<p>This requirement set by unreal is very very analogous. They just have some shifted priorities, however for me this project now meets the standard of what I would consider &quot;ethical&quot;.<p>Could it be better? Sure why not? It could be GPL dual license, people who want to benefit from open source but release closed source I think should have to pay, that would be better. However, this library can now be effectively used for open source initiatives. This is fantastic.<p>That&#x27;s my estimation of the situation anyway, you perhaps do not see it like this. Could you go further into your position?",1425322798

This is distinct from something with an evergreen consumer service or product that will be monetizable over the long run.<p>The task for the CEO is can take the capirtal on hand and start building good (evergreen) products?<p>If nothing else she should be given (retain) some capital and another 3 years before making a final judgement. At that stage, take a look at the pipleline and if there is nothing in it...that will be a signal.<p>Yahoo right now is like a pharma company which had a blockbuster come off of patent...its all about the ability to re-plenish the pipeline...the profits that happened previously are nearly irrelevant except for providing the position/capital to recruit people for the next round of product development.",1425322758

If you think of an alternative to that,let me know. Security is a matter of layers. The more layers you add, the more secure it gets. A smart thing to do is not to choose site.com/wp-admin.php as an admin URL accessible all over the net. Unfortunatly WP makes it very hard not to do that.<p>Using WP is bad for small businesses that think WP makes webdev easy,because it tends to promote non secure habits for the sake of easy installation and use. WP is bad for big businesses because it&#x27;s an serious attack vector.

We understand that a disruption with such limited notice is inconvenient, and we hope you understand that these measures are warranted due to the severity of the XSAs.<p>Your Linodes have been assigned a maintenance window in which a reboot will occur. These times are listed within the Linode Manager[1] in the timezone set in your user&#x27;s My Profile[2]. Your schedule in UTC timezone is as follows:<p>/* List of linodes */<p>During the maintenance window Linode instances will be cleanly shut down while we perform the updates. Your Linode will be inaccessible during this time. A two-hour window is allocated, however the actual downtime can be much less. After the maintenance, each Linode will then be booted. See our Reboot Survival Guide[3] for tips and hints on configuring and testing that your Linode services boot properly after the maintenance.<p>Unfortunately, due the logistical demands of this effort, your assigned windows are not changeable and the host reboots are mandatory.<p>For general information, please see our status post: <http://status.linode.com/incidents/2dyvn29ds5mz><p>Please let us know if there is anything we can do to assist.<p>[1] <https://manager.linode.com/linodes>

Yes, people volunteer, because they are expected to.<p>It is pretty clear that you have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about.  You know that you can dislike people in general, but still recognize positive qualities right?  Here is another example: Sergeant Major Bradley Kasal.  This guy used his own body as a bullet stop to protect his Marines, nobody expects that.<p>> What about speaking up about a situation that is going to get people killed?<p>There was a lot of that, we got it shut down at the eleventh hour.<p>> What about the people who didn&#x27;t volunteer, where they fine with the whole thing as long as they weren&#x27;t affected?<p>I didn&#x27;t poll everybody, but I&#x27;m pretty confident in saying that nobody was fine with the situation.  At lot of those guys were pretty torn between loyalty to their families, the guys that they&#x27;d just been in combat with and their fellow Marines in the artillery battalion.  There were many private conversation had were they tried to talk volunteers out of it, and more than one anonymous letter to a General.<p>> Is the commander visiting his guys after years and year when they are dealing with PTSD?<p>Do you think that is practical?  In their careers they will have commanded thousands of men.  There is a strong bond though, for example: another personal story :)  When I got out of the Corps I drove all the way across the country, for a job in DC.  After a few days of searching, I found a basement apartment for rent - the landlord lived upstairs with his wife and toddler daughter.  Purely by chance, the landlord was a Colonel in the USMC, and he instantly treated me like an old family friend - standing invitation to dinner, long conversation on the porch, etc.  The wife was not a big fan of this, and I&#x27;m pretty sure my new buddy was constantly catching hell for it.  Until one day, several months later, when I came home from work and found the front door wide open and heard panicked footsteps inside.  Now this was in pretty much the worst part of DC, and I could have easily just made my way to my private entrance and ignored the possibility that the landlord was getting burgled.  Instead, I began clearing the house room by room - armed with a paring knife from the kitchen.  I gave the cleaning lady quite a shock, she had forgotten the alarm code and was rushing around trying to find it.  I was sure that I&#x27;d get the boot for that, but instead I got a dinner invitation from the wife.  The cleaning lady informed her of what happened, and it suddenly clicked for her - I was family.<p>> The military selectively decides what part of these virtues that are valued.<p>Again, spoken like somebody who has no idea what they&#x27;re talking about.  Outside of the philosophy department in college, I&#x27;ve never seen an organization focus as much on morality as the USMC.  Of course, the perspective is that of the state.  So any flaws you find in the logic of military morality will be rooted in the state, not the military.",1425319694

No one aspect of American democracy seems able to crash the system.<p>Some modules can be completely re-written for better results, for instance our tax system could be replaced by some type of flat-tax.<p>Other ones can get by with significant refactoring over a long period, maybe financial regulation could have better consumer protection and ultimately allow for a more equitable distribution of wealth (I&#x27;m&#x27; not economist, maybe those goals don&#x27;t even involve each other)<p>And other ones just need bug patches, for instance interstate commerce, which I&#x27;d guess is smooth as a cucumber right now, but we could have more states align on issues of policy that create confusion in the marketplace (a Delaware C copr is a great example of people finding those simple solutions).<p>It is hard to think of a really good, functioning part of government, but generally those are the ones we don&#x27;t even notice.

Quantitative easing increases the money supply by flooding financial institutions with capital in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity. Quantitative easing is considered when short-term interest rates are at or approaching zero, and does not involve the printing of new banknotes.<p>So if suddenly, a new player shows up in the markets buying trillions of dollars worth of securities, due to the law of supply and demand, one can expect price of stocks to go up.

By comparison, other large cities with exorbitant costs of living fared even worse. Washington, D.C., had a greater number of homeless, 7,748, out of a much smaller population of 646,449. Honolulu had 4,712 homeless out of a population of 374,658.

Actually, there was an incident I was personally witness to involving someone&#x27;s 8 year old son and an ordinary clawhammer. There is clearly such a thing as &quot;desensitization,&quot; and opposition to the notion is usually the kind of unconscious bias one generally sees in politics. < <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/</a> > Note that my position is not so simpleminded as to be simply placed on one side or another of the typical Internet argument.<p>If you believe that widespread gun ownership generally increases the incidence of gun injuries, then you are subscribing to the same general theory, that availability increases likelihood. Do I believe that&#x27;s a justification for banning things? No, but we should be honest about the existence of such effects. (Also, fists and feet are an entirely different category, as they are naturally part of your body. And while I said it wasn&#x27;t common in some places, in others kids do use those to enact violence.)<p><i>Like others said, if video games made normal people violent you&#x27;d see a lot more violence.</i><p>I would put good odds on your repeating what lots of people angrily repeat on the Internet in defense of their hobby. In the grand scheme of things, people <i>are</i> violent! We are extraordinarily violent as animals. In particular, we have an ability to band together in groups and murder each other in a coordinated fashion, one that probably predates our getting language! We also accomplish fantastic things living together, so we also have fantastic mechanisms for coexisting. Seeing things in media does have the effect of reinforcing the portrayed actions and scenarios in our minds. However, human minds are very complex and robust. We have mental defenses, much as we have homeostatic mechanisms.<p><i>That anecdote about the &#x27;enacting a GTA scenario&#x27; would also have happened just like that without the GTA link. Then it becomes a guy with a gun in a police station.</i><p>Read up on the incident and honestly tell me that GTA had nothing to do with putting the idea into his head. Of course, one could also find other pieces of media he was exposed to conveying much the same message. The systemic problems resulting in his violence are probably more serious and of greater import to society than the content of some video game.",1425319395

There are <i>NO</i> homeless people who are in that position because they felt it was more profitable or easier than getting a job and living in a house. This is the same insanity that insists that people on unemployment benefits are somehow living an easy life, feeding cynically off the state, rather than trapped in poverty.<p>The article also dismisses most of your other points. In particular, noting that San Francisco has a minimal homelessness problem compared to such liberal cities as Washington DC or New York.",1425319381

Most of the people I know who watch only mainstream news all believe that we are going to have a massive crash that will completely kill our country in a few years.<p>When you actually ignore the hype and look at purely the numbers you&#x27;ll see that the US is doing incredible compared to the rest of the world right now. The Euro is crashing, Russia is in ruins, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s OPEC squeeze is now hurting all of the other &quot;US enemies&quot; while the net effect of the oil crisis on the US is mostly zero-sum.<p>I&#x27;m incredibly bullish on the US right now. Sure we&#x27;ll probably have another small crash in the next few years but we&#x27;ll recover quickly and keep on surging for the foreseeable future. That&#x27;s the nature of market cycles! It&#x27;s super easy to be negative and for some reason that&#x27;s the cool trend for people to take right now but frankly the macro-view of the facts say differently.",1425319364

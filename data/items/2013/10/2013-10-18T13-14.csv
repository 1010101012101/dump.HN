6571384,comment,6567966,6571043,2,0,dbbolton,,,"My dad and I are in a similar situation to you- terrible nasal congestion constantly interfering with sleep.<p>The quick and dirty solution is decongestants. However, vasoconstrictors (pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline, phenylepherine, etc.) often have a &quot;rebound effect&quot;, i.e. when they wear off you find you&#x27;re actually more congested than you were before you took the drug. In this sense they can be quite addictive. I try not to use any unless it&#x27;s absolutely necessary, and only once every few days at that.<p>One thing that helps a little bit is Breathe Right nasal strips. They will often open up the nasal passages enough that I no longer have to struggle to breathe through my nose. If I&#x27;m only slightly congested, I use these. I don&#x27;t know if the increased air flow would be enough to keep you asleep or not, but it&#x27;s probably worth a try.<p>For the most part, I have pretty much adapted to function on a few hours&#x27; worth of sleep. I can go on a three hour nap twice a day for an indefinite length of time. I don&#x27;t know if that is enough rest to fully clean up the brain, but I don&#x27;t feel crappy all the time so I suppose it&#x27;s good enough. It definitely works better for me than sleeping for 6 hours once a day. I typically sleep in on the weekends, but I recently saw an article claiming that isn&#x27;t enough to erase slept debt accumulated during the week.",1382104790

But many people today see the screens and volumes, and say &quot;see, HFT gives liquidity!&quot;, and that&#x27;s wrong. I&#x27;m not saying HFT took liquidity away (it may have, I don&#x27;t know, but for sure I didn&#x27;t claim that). But it does <i>not</i> improve the liquidity that matters to <i>most</i> market participants.<p>> executing giant orders in one fell swoop hasn&#x27;t gotten any better under HFT, but it hardly seems to have made it worse.<p>I agree. I&#x27;m just countering the oft repeated meme that &quot;HFT provides liquidity&quot;. Essentially, it doesn&#x27;t.<p>> I don&#x27;t know about &quot;often,&quot; unless you&#x27;re talking about trading individual issues where news events introduce a high degree of uncertainty. There&#x27;s really only been one case of a market-wide drying up of liquidity, which lasted for about 15 minutes during the flash crash.<p>There&#x27;s been tens of &quot;flash crash&quot; and &quot;flash smash&quot; events in the last couple of years. Not of the magnitude of the one blamed on Waddell and Reed, but it&#x27;s still happening.<p>> There&#x27;s also nothing new about market-maker liquidity drying up in times of uncertainty or severe volatility.<p>I agree. I just disagree that HFT are providing any kind of service or benefit to the market. They only benefit themselves, at a cost to the market that goes way beyond the profit from arbitrage/scalping action that they do.<p>And it is easy to put a stop to: Adopt the rule Eurex and LIFFE had in 2001 that requires 10:1 order:execution ratio.",1382104627

In terms of general public opinion, there are, of course, contingents of uber-liberal/uber-conservitive outliers on either end; but the majority of the public are simply fed up with what is perceived as an increasingly petty and entrenched stalemate with little transparency as to what is actually being negotiated.<p>BART employees and their unions say salaries are too low for the (high) cost of living in the area, and should be increased by 23% to correct that. However, BART (and increasingly, the public) argue that BART jobs require no technical skills or education (beyond a HS diploma) and are benefitted and secure jobs already paying far above the average wage for jobs of similar (low) skill levels; and in light of the context (economic and otherwise), only a 4% raise should be granted. The percentage raise rates have gone back and forth on both ends, but that&#x27;s the general gist.<p>source (on the 68-77% strike disapproval): <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2013/10/10/bart-strike.html?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2013/10/10/bart...</a>",1382104520

They do this by not allowing the exporters to keep the dollars they earn. Instead the exporters are forced to trade those dollars in for Chinese currency which is artificially pegged against the dollar. This means the exporters immediately lose value.<p>What the author completely fails to understand is that this is another possible outcome:
 * China decides to increase the standard of living of it&#x27;s citizen
 * China slowly increases their currency peg to be closer to the value of the dollar
 * The exporters slowly have a higher profit, and thus the people a higher standard of living
 * The united states slowly lowers it&#x27;s standard of living<p>Of course this is one possible outcome. However, the idea that the Chinese are forced to buy our bonds is ridiculous.

I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m one, and I&#x27;ve only worked at one company where they were common, and that was a VC-funded company with MBA culture, and that&#x27;s <i>why</i> there was so much sexism (among management). Plenty of these tech companies have the old, sexist MBA culture where women exist to make powerful men feel important, young, manly, etc.; but plenty more <i>don&#x27;t</i> have that culture.<p>There&#x27;s very little explicit classism. However, there is much indirect classism as a result of the severe ageism. If you age-grade peoples&#x27; careers harshly and discount accomplishments after 35, you&#x27;re favoring people who had a head start (rich kids) while downgrading the people who worked hard for decades. That&#x27;s a real problem but it doesn&#x27;t exist because people <i>explicitly</i> favor the privileged. They don&#x27;t. They&#x27;re just prone to the same biases as everyone else, and thus are influenced by precociousness and pedigree. This is amplified by the groupthink in the VC community, and would be substantially less of a problem if there were more independent thought.<p>Why are many VCs ageist? (That&#x27;s where the general &quot;bro&quot; culture comes from; it trickles down.) Because MBA culture (which is different from tech, the latter being far more evolved) is sexist and ageist, and also because a lot of these gatekeepers are middle-aged private-equity guys who did their 20s completely wrong (90-hour weeks) and are trying to live vicariously through young sociopaths whose careers they can make, in exchange for juicy tidbits about what their proteges did on the weekend (&quot;chickenhawking&quot;; see Michael Scott and Ryan Howard in <i>The Office</i>). Most VCs aren&#x27;t that pathetic, but the groupthink favors the chickenhawk compliant (privileged, young, somewhat sociopathic, party-friendly) at the expense of the true technologists.<p>The real problem is the lack of <i>fighters</i> in tech, which leads to conformity and groupthink among the crowd that matters (VCs, top founders). Groupthink magnifies the biases of the defective few.<p>The real problem is that true technologists have done a poor job of protecting the culture; the <i>real</i> technology culture is far more meritocratic than the bastardized version the MBAs and private equity guys came up with. If we want fairness and a return to a maker-centric culture in the Valley and in the software industry in general, we can have it; but we have to get better at fighting for our own interests.<p>End Rant.",1382104136

This is a well defined measurement, unlike things about &quot;decisions&quot;, which are not well defined.<p>> The question is should we try to prevent low latency trading? If so, why? And how can we? Will any system we put in place cause more problems than it is worth?<p>&quot;Low Latency&quot; and &quot;High Frequency&quot; are not equivalent, even though you seem to think so. &quot;Low Latency&quot; relates to one event. &quot;High Frequency&quot; indicates a rapid succession of events (Frequency is a measure <i>repeating</i> phenomena). High frequency does not theoretically imply low latency (or the other way around), but practically the correlation between low latency and high frequency is 100%.<p>If you follow the nanex links, you&#x27;ll see the &quot;low latency&quot; players are bullying the &quot;higher latency&quot; players, and should be prevented from doing so.<p>In fact, many exchanges do that - e.g. Some european future exchanges will fine you if your order:execution ratio is >10. Meaning, you have, on average, to execute 10% of the orders you give. In the US, some players have an 10000:1 order:execution order. We should disallow that - as everyone else pays exchange fees for a faster system to suit these players, and then pays more to have a system that can keep up with the spurious orders these guys send.<p>Really, Eurex has this trivially solved. Since 2001.<p>> Finally, if you don&#x27;t think currency markets are fair,<p>I do not think they are fair.

There are so many complex and mostly untested effects at play that I&#x27;d be a bit worried if anyone claims to have the one true answer here.<p><pre><code>  Pro for China buying bonds
  - US government has more money to stimulate economy
  - US dollar remains strong, so buying from offshore is cheap
  - Higher quality of living in USA means more people can
    spend time inventing new industries

  Con for China buying bonds
  - US dollar weaker, US firms are under-priced when exporting
  - When China stops buying bonds it will cause a shock effect
    on US economy
  - Higher quality of living in USA means less people are forced
    to invent new industries or starve
  - US government is wasting the money on stuff like TSA instead

In the same way that you might decide CitiGroup is no longer a good investment, and stop buying (or selling) their bonds.<p>But in reality, it&#x27;s not like the Chinese are looking around at all the sovereign debt in the world and deciding where to put their money.

So they buy US bonds.  It&#x27;s a mutually beneficial arrangement.<p>I&#x27;m glad some of this is reaching the mainstream media.

Won&#x27;t push them as hard. Generally just not care(as much). I think it&#x27;s better for the under-performers to see the strong-performers and understand those kids are not magically-smarter, they just work hard and it&#x27;s completely possible for the under-performers to be like them if they try to mimic their study habits.<p>Once you divide a group between the &quot;desired&quot; and &quot;non-desired&quot; traits, there&#x27;s no way the less desired people will get the same quality attention as the desired. It pretty much will turn into: Group them all together, then systematically eliminate them, condemn them or make them irrelevant. Basically, that segregation will become the solution itself:<p><i>&quot;We need to get class-A performance up to get more funding or raise our GPA average so our Class-A looks better to those affluent parents to send their kids to! Hmm, billy & mandy aren&#x27;t too bright and are lowering the average.

For example, the bouncing ball problem, with a series of questions to tease out our application of calculus, memorisation of compression rules and so on.<p>Then comes the final question. I remember it well because at first, I did not know which formula to apply. Water wells into a pool at rate X per hour, falls over a waterfall into a second pool below, which drains at rate Y per hour. When it falls over the edge of the waterfall, the water is at temperature A; at the start of the problem the temperature in the bottom pool is C.<p>After an hour, what will the temperature in the second pool be?<p>To solve this problem you actually need to consider the thermic effect of water falling. You need to build a single equation to accounts for acceleration due to gravity and the beginning temperatures of each pool. Then you need some calculus to transform it into an equation that will spit out the final numerical answer.<p>The only reason I was able to attempt and solve this problem was <i>because I had memorised the equations</i>. There simply would not have been enough time to try to reverse-engineer a bunch of anonymous letters in-flight.<p>Similarly, when I studied law, all exams were open-book. This is because, as a law professor told me, &quot;it lets us ask harder questions&quot;. There&#x27;s simply no way to synthesise thousands of pages of material in an exam setting. Either you learnt it beforehand, including a whole bunch of flat out memorisation of details of cases, or you didn&#x27;t.

They simply change the weight of some colors relatively to others.<p>But a dichromat with say, missing L cones will not simply mix green and red, he will experience &quot;green&quot; totally differently than a trichromat. What a trichromat call green is the result of the stimulation of both M and L cones. We cannot see the pure spectral green. We cannot subtract the L cones contributions to what we experience, and its is quite important. The dichromat won&#x27;t have any L cones contribution, the physiological stimuli won&#x27;t be the same. He sees the actual spectral green. A color we have never seen and that we cannot imagine.<p>Now there is an experiment to do : put a full page of bright red and stare at it for minutes. It will start to become orange-ish. This is your L cones getting tired. Now swiftly switch to a bright green full page (prepare it so you can switch with a key press). You will experience a purer green that you ever experienced, because this green will have less red component to it as your L cones are tired (the effect will last mere seconds and quickly fade into normal green).

Scoping is just something you have to understand as with tables there is no problem with them besides a beginners understanding of them.<p>What you consider a minor gripe, compound assignment operator, I personally think is a flaw in the language same goes for bitwise functions instead of operators.
Here is an example I posted earlier on twitter.<p>object = object + other<p>&quot;object&quot; and &quot;other&quot; here are full userdata and the code is going to malloc a new userdata and also create a new object in C/C++; which is straight away going to over write the original instance.

It&#x27;s something that really irritates me, and frankly it has put me off of owning a smartphone at all (not having a microSD slot).<p>I also noticed a few limititations for the first time with my partners Nook HD that does have an SD slot.  I bought a 32gb MicroSD card for it  to store video and music.  When trying to download from the web browser files went to local storage.  I also had issues with downloading in general, some of which would be incomplete or disappear.  While downloading I expected to be able to move to another app, and have the download background.  It was a pretty shonky experience.  I tried to find some kind of setting for it and ultimately realised that Android wasn&#x27;t that brilliantly suited to handle external memory.<p>I&#x27;m never that sure if a device is going to take ownership of something like a micro SD card when I attach it.  The whole portable format thing is a pain too.  Not being able to use ExFat easily on my Linux laptop is a pain.  I&#x27;m surprised one of the free file systems haven&#x27;t been chosen as the default for for usb sticks, memory cards etc.  Probably a result of manufacturers looking to have Windows compatibility.<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure myself which way I think opening media should go, should I select an app first and then open something, or should I use a &#x27;finder&#x27; to get to a file and then choose what to do with it?  I guess the latter at least affords for the &#x27;finder&#x27; to suggest what to do with it, if not have a sensible default.  Should my &#x27;finder&#x27; know if a piece of software can handle the file upfront?   Should software register what it can handle to a central authority?  Sometimes you might not know wihch is the best software to open something with.<p>From a users perspective, I&#x27;d at least hope that if the device had 8GB on it, and if I had a card plugged in with 32GB, when I went to download a 1GB file it may put that on the 32GB card.  Maybe there should be named storage pools that you could select when downloading.  Or a sensible default.<p>Perhaps when you plug in media you should get the option of integrating it to the devices storage, or having it as temporary or portable storage.<p>The whole file management thing doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s solved on the desktop, but neither does it feel particulary good on Android. I think I like to know where my files are.<p>I do get that this is an epic problem.

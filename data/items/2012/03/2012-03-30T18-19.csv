The privacy policy basically gives Leaky the right to do whatever they want with my personally identifiable information, such as providing an unlimited set of third parties for ""internal business purposes,"" an unlimited number of present or future affiliates which they will ""seek to require"" to adhere to the privacy policy, to anyone who may purchase the company or its assets, or for a fairly extensive list of fraud and law enforcement reasons, to disclose it to an unspecified set of entities.<p>On top of that, there is no limitation on how long Leaky will hold such personally identifiable information, nor any information about how to get Leaky to remove it. So basically, once I enter information into Leaky, they may hold onto it forever and sell it to whoever they like for quite a wide variety of reasons, with no recourse for the user to protect their information.<p>I don't think that I would ever want to put such personal information in a service with such a weak privacy policy. And given the new model, in which this is just an implementation of the complex pricing structures used by auto insurance agencies, I wonder why this couldn't be made into an application that runs locally and never exposes my personal information to anyone else. Yes, you would probably have to go with a paid application, rather than an ad-supported web site, with all of the problems that entails, but for a product like this with such important privacy concerns and such little value (to the customer) to putting the data online or sharing it with people, it really seems like it would make more sense as an offline application, not a web app.",1333133857

Tell a child a curse word they don't know and they aren't stricken back as if you had slapped them. It has no meaning or value until you describe what it means and when to use it. Then once it's explained to them, assuming they weren't harangued by their parents into fearing the word itself, there's the use in a book such as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn:<p><i>""Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio  a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see...""</i><p>Contrast this with a book like Where The Red Fern Grows, where a boy's dog (who he loves dearly) is disemboweled in front of him and he has to literally stuff his intestines back into the dog's bloody carcass.<p>If the high purpose is indeed to protect children they should be taught about the world so they'll know how to deal with it. Sure, there's ugly things about the world and for the most part we try to isolate ourselves from it, but burning it doesn't make it go away. The end result may be it enforces in the child the idea that they can choose to destroy any part of society they dislike, regardless of anyone else's opinion and without a reason other than their feelings.

I implemented all of the strategies outlined here, and while they seemed impressed with the execution speed of my solution, they implied it could have scored better, saying it was only ""average"" in that regard.<p>The thing is, at least for the dictionaries I had available, trying to weight for information gain only considering the guess correctness wasn't all that great a strategy.

3777512,comment,3775826,3775826,4,0,jrockway,,,"Don't forget about how expensive housing is in NYC.  If you want to live in Manhattan and have ever lived anywhere else, to get an apartment that vaguely resembles what you consider an apartment, you're going to be paying $3000 a month.  Recently, it seems, Brooklyn has realized that it is not very far away from Manhattan and the rents have gone up to match.  In Chicago, I lived in a brand new building, downtown, and had an 820 square foot apartment for $1400 a month.  In Brooklyn, I have about 500 square feet, no AC, no microwave, in a building built in 1883 for $2400 a month.  And, I had to pay a broker two months rent for the privilege of renting their apartment.  (Yes, Brooklyn Heights is a particularly expensive neighborhood and the commute time to Chelsea is less than from many places in Manhattan.  But it's not a $1000 value-add from what I had in Chicago.)<p>Ultimately, I can afford this because Google pays me a lot of money and buys me three meals a day.  But if you are bootstrapping a startup, you probably don't have this much money to burn, and there's really no compelling reason to live in NYC unless you spend all your time doing social things.  If you're programming, buy yourself a more comfortable apartment in Kansas City, or something.  $2400 a month buys you the entire city :)",1333133612

Amateurs are easily caught because they don't have the time or knowledge to properly plan an attack and the pros have the resources to work around any defenses the TSA has set up because the TSA cannot be proactive enough in its measures. Bruce argues that post-9/11 security measures are both superfluous and insufficient at the same time.<p>However, what if the amateurs and pros could work together? What if the pros developed attacks and published the directions? Amateurs could use those directions to their hearts content. In that sense, reactive security may not prevent al Qaeda from attempting new clever attacks, but it will prevent copycat attacks an the part of sympathizers (or folks with their own agendas) who have no overt connections to major terrorist networks. Organized criminal hacker organizations have been known to pull this very same stunt by releasing easy to use programs which make it possible for dilettantes to pull off attacks that they would otherwise be unable to do.<p>In fact, it's a little bit like computer security, where, every time a vulnerability is discovered, either by a security researcher, or through a successful zero-day exploit, a patch is developed to plug the hole and thousands of sysadmins apply the patch as soon as possible. In this way, we can't prove that say, Apache, has no vulnerabilities, but we can be sure that it has no known vulnerabilities and all the easy ones to find have been dealt with long ago.<p>So it seems to me, that by routinely 'plugging holes' so to speak by implementing reactive measures, the TSA is increasing the marginal cost of each attack for al Qaeda significantly, and this hypothetically, does increase security.<p>Of course, that doesn't detract from any of the other arguments against the TSA in it current incarnation, especially the obvious haphazardness of its measures, the occasional abusiveness of screeners, and its political essence. It does though, seem to make one of Bruce's arguments seem less strong.",1333132928

The number of people who feel disenfranchised or held back or discriminated against, can reach further now with the Internet than at any time in the past. The combination of these two situations has as one of its outcomes and out pouring of emotion (generally hate) against the 'others.'<p>I realize that when the pendulum is heavily into the 'personal' side of responsibility those people are more likely to commit suicide rather than to spew vitriol. Clearly that is a bad place to be as well.<p>The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle, where people take personal responsibility for their own challenges and the group takes responsibility for those things which are (or should be) beyond the responsibility of any one person. The canonical example is education, where the group should be responsible for making sure educational opportunities are available and the individuals should make sure they take advantage of all of the opportunities afforded them.<p>It is a new thing in the world that the meanest and foulest 10% of society have the ability to reach just as many people as the nicest and wisest 10%, I cannot predict the eventual impact of that fundamental change.",1333132252

While a psychopath may be able to perceive, but unable to empathize with, a person, someone in the depths of psychotic delusion may be unable to perceive a fellow human being. It is perhaps not nearly as common ""in the wild"", but it does occur (the killing of Tim McLean by Vince Weiguang Li being the example that comes most easily to mind). In fact, generating a sort of ""target psychosis"" has been the aim of most modern infantry training for some time, since teaching people to see, recognize and react to targets is an awful lot easier than training them to kill humans, even under severe threat. (Human-shaped targets were introduced to training after it was discovered that most infanteers never actually fired an aimed shot at an opponent in either of the World Wars.)

        $(yui) --type js --nomunge < $< > $@

So I wonder what Sand Flea could be working towards other than surveillance?  11 lbs./30 ft is not bad considering a quad copter of similar size would be probably max 4-6 lbs.  So maybe they are gearing it up for heavier payloads.  Nothing like the 400 lbs alpha dog carries (at that point, assuming similar tech, the Sand Flea would have to be big enough to basically just roll over single-story buildings), but perhaps an explosive payload or something in the neighborhood of 10-20 lbs.",1333131920

All it needs is an HTML/CSS layout and some content that can come from either static HTML files, a few form handlers and perhaps some parts that my client can update themselves. Most of the time this can be solved by simply creating a part of the site behind a login with a few text boxes that update a database and are then displayed on the site or the ability to create lists of things.<p>I can create this sort of functionality myself from scratch in an afternoon or so and it is usually much easier to use for the client because it will have less buttons on the interface and be designed around metaphors that they are actually interested in (for example types of cake or whatever).
I gave a client Drupal to use once and the result was that they would just call me up every time they wanted an update done to the site.<p>If it's something non trivial then I'd rather not have to work around a clunky PHP codebase and worry about the plethora of security updates I would have to do when I could just create something much more flexible in Java/Scala/Python.",1333131655

If you are male and don't want to have kids, make sure you use your own condoms. Woman has many more options to avoid pregnancy, man has one shot with the condom (AFAIK vasectomy can be permanent).<p>I think this type of birth control has the potential of lowering paternity fraud since man will know the child is not his.

The sooner we start new ones that get this right, the fewer their days are numbered.<p>But you may have missed my point by a couple degrees. It wasn't that companies should look at initiative and aptitude directly. It's that those are the things that drive you to acquire the skills that make you good. Then you can prove that you're good.<p>How exactly to prove you're good, or for companies to tell who's good, is a billion (trillion?) dollar question that's in flux right now. But clearly it has more to do with showing work and less with weak proxies like years of experience (which may be years of doing things badly) or resumes (a skill uncorrelated if not inversely correlated with good programming). Since startups are starved for good hackers, somebody's going to figure this out, gain a huge edge, and pave the way for the rest.<p>In the meantime, training/retraining programs are not going to increase the talent pool much. Something fresh like Hacker School might, though.<p>Edit: in my opinion the eventual answer is going to be found by reasoning backward from Christopher Alexander's great question, ""What feels more alive?""

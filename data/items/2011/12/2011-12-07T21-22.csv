In some cases it might actually turn out a bit better, like 90/5/5 or something like that.<p>Regardless, the outcome seen by founders is orders of magnitude better than even early employees.<p>This can be exacerbated by a bunch of games that can be played at an exit to make the disparity larger. For example, you can cancel all unvested options. Founders have likely been around longer than the employees, so they have more stock vested, plus they typically get some acceleration upon change of control.<p>For example, imagine that a founder has 25%, and employee number 1 (who was hired 6 months after the company started) has 2%. That they sell to Google after the company has been around for 2 years, and that all unvested shares are cancelled. Employee 1 gets .75%, and the founder, who has 1 year acceleration on change of control, has 18.75%. On top of that, the founder probably gets long-term capital gains treatment because he exercised his shares immediately, where the employee didn't exercise any of his shares and treats the gain as income (if he had a 1-year cliff, he probably couldn't exercise for a year, at which point it didn't matter, because he had only held the shares for 6 months when the company was sold). So the employee ends up with 0.5% after taxes, and the founder ends up with 15.63%.<p>Which means that he ends up doing about 30x as well as the first employee.",1323294790

Yes it is - however, the difference between multi-methods and the polymorphism you get in Java (and Python) is that Java does runtime <i>single-dispatch</i> on the <i>implicit parameter</i> only, whereas a multimethod can do runtime dispatch on all parameters.<p>Plus, because it is at runtime, you can also give it conditions that aren't necessarily related to the types involved (depending on implementation of course).<p><pre><code>    Overall, I think features like this make more sense

Yes, some of the decisions (like crippling the byte types, or implicitly changing behavior based on environment variables) turn out to be bad decisions, but it still sounds like there's already some work towards fixing these. As more and more people gets to work with Python 3, that seems normal to me. As we know, ""There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses."" It seems to me that Python 3 has started to get its healthy dose of bashing, and that's a good thing.<p>As for my anectodal experience with 2to3: I've recently been working on porting rpclib to Python 3. After skimming the diffs it produced for a simple `2to3 src/rpclib` call, I chose to ignore most of the transformations it applies.<p>Replacing commas in except statements by the ""as"" keyword or adding parentheses where missing work just fine. But wrapping every call to dict.keys() inside a list() call? That's bold.<p>Once 2to3 is tamed[1], I think the code it generates can be maintained. Certainly beats having to get the current exception from sys.exc_info.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/plq/rpclib/blob/master/2to3.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/plq/rpclib/blob/master/2to3.sh</a>",1323293323

On submission, the web server sends the code to one of the sandboxes, which compiles and executes it and returns any output (SSH seems convenient for this). Any other network access to/from the sandboxes is blocked. If one of the sandboxes stops accepting connections or otherwise misbehaves, reboot it.<p>This doesn't isolate the untrusted programs from each other. Sufficiently nasty code may be able to persist across reboots by nestling in firmware, but that does not pose an additional security problem. This setup is trivial to DoS, but it's simple and doesn't rely on, say, the Linux kernel being secure from local attacks - you just need a properly-configured firewall, e.g. on the web host (""drop all packets to/from sandboxes except locally-initiated SSH connections"").",1323293005

""Happy Holidays"" sounds like PC jargon and robotic, customer ass kissing. If we just leave out for a moment the fact that not all people celebrate Christmas this makes sense.<p>I honestly think that Christmas is more of a cultural thing here in the US than a purely religious celebration. We have a majority of people who celebrate Christmas as part of their religion but even of those people a majority of them are focused more on the cultural sensation that is Christmas rather than the religious aspects even though they're Christian. The lights, the colors, Santa, presents, and the general mood of the holiday is what really makes Christmas in America, not the actual birth of Christ. That's why even people who aren't Christian or religious at all can get into it. They're surrounded by it and it's just a part of life here.<p>In countries where the ""Christmas Spirit"" isn't as prevalent in the culture with populations that are split between Christian and non-Christians more evenly I think Happy Holidays would sound more sincere and not exclusionary. Over here if you say ""Happy Holidays"" its like saying ""I <i>would</i> say Merry Christmas but I'm going to be extra PC and say Happy Holidays just in case you're a Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, or other unspecified form of pagan, heathen, or otherwise non-Christian, non Christ believing individual"". A little exaggerated, yes, but Happy Holidays really does sound like this to many and that's part of the reason that the conservative party over here makes a big deal over ""the war on Christmas"" every year with the ""Merry Christmas vs Happy Holidays"" debate being very close to the center of it each time.<p>I know I said a lot, and my theory is based on personal experience and anecdotal evidence but I really think it makes a lot of sense.

Bricks and stones make bad building materials in that region because they fall on people and kill them in an earthquake.<p>I live in the Southeast US where earthquakes basically do not happen. Houses are often at least partially built with bricks here (especially older homes). My 80 year old home is built out of bricks on a dirt foundation with plaster on the interior walls.<p>Newer houses here are often built with pine frames, poured concrete basements and various types of siding (including brick).<p>Picture of stucco: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stucco_wall.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stucco_wall.jpg</a><p>Picture of typical California suburban home:

If the motd mattered anything to me, I would have been aware of the change.<p>I was blindsided by this change too and one day, like years ago, I noticed that the motd wasn't working as I expected and reset itself. I did (something to the effect of) this:<p><pre><code>    $ ls -l /etc/motd*
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 2008-09-23 21:44 /etc/motd -> /var/run/motd
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 2009-06-14 15:01 /etc/motd.tail
</code></pre>
Then I thought ""oh I see what they did there"", dropped a banner in motd.tail and moved on with life.  Wow, yeah, 2 and a half years ago.  Didn't care then, still don't care now.",1323291653

Download the app for free to get the trial, then pay to unlock the full version. Many apps are already using this approach.",1323291615

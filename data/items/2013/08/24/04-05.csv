6267691,comment,6266534,6267377,3,0,silentbicycle,,,"Lua has access to the filesystem, but you probably want the luafilesystem module for general scripting, it provides more POSIX and Windows-specific functionality.<p>As a general rule, the Lua standard library only includes what can be portably built on the C standard library. Instead of &quot;batteries included&quot;, Lua is small and portable everywhere (&quot;travel light&quot;), and makes it easy to wrap other functionality via the C API. Sometimes that&#x27;s a problem, but sometimes it&#x27;s exactly what you want - say, when Python would be too big a dependency, Lua is an excellent option.<p>(No experience with MoonScript. I&#x27;m content with Lua&#x27;s syntax. I much prefer it to Ruby&#x27;s, for example.)",1377320258

6267683,comment,6263031,6266198,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"The need for something like Bower or Browserify comes when you have complicated projects with lots of dependencies, some more than one level deep.<p>For example, app A depends on library B which depends on library C. If C is jQuery and those are <i>all</i> the dependencies you have, it&#x27;s fine; but when a project grows a little larger, you do want a proper system.<p>This is not an uncommon thing; modularizing an app or library into many small, independent parts is simply good practice.<p>Concrete example: Our company has a library which is currently monolithic and too big for its own repo, so it needs to be broken up into many different modules.<p>For this we <i>have</i> to have a dependency system because every module in the library needs to be able to say that it needs another module to run.<p>Plus, if you are developing an app that uses (a bunch of modules from) the library, you want to be able to work on the module code concurrently. Having to minify/package library code and copy it into the app every time you make a change is very inconvenient.<p>Plus, eventually you need to bundle a single file, eg. mylib.min.js, that combine all the modules. Also a chore without a dependency system. Might be fine for just isolated one case, gets stupidly annoying for the next project, and the next, and so on.<p>What I like about Browserify is that you just require libraries in your code where you need them, and that way all dependencies are expressed in code; whereas Bower has explicit metadata, separate from the code, which may get out of sync over time.",1377320070

It certainly sheds light on whether or not Microsoft should own the trademark on &quot;Windows&quot;, as it is obvious it is an established generic term at the time by the way the article was written (&quot;windows&quot; is not in direct reference to Microsoft&#x27;s product at all in the article).<p>This is not news to me, mind you, as I remember painstakingly entering every character of a long machine-language program into the monitor (call -151) of my Apple //c back in the &#x27;80s, for a graphical &quot;windows&quot; system published in Nibble Magazine (I really wanted a Cauzin strip reader!).\nThis software was merely interesting, not really useful without extensive work. You could do the same sort of thing with a few pokes (defining the corners of the printable/scrollable screen area), just without the fancy graphics. It had no mouse support, relying on the keyboard for input and the software currently running in a window to manage the contents of that window. Being hand-entered from a magazine, I didn&#x27;t exactly expect more. Still, it was fun to show people at the time. :) Of course the software discussed in the article was far more useful, but still probably not that much <i>at the time</i>.<p>I also remember the threats that Caldera made against Microsoft, saying they had enough prior art to lift Microsoft&#x27;s trademark. That certainly had some interesting twists.<p>Later the suit between Microsoft and Lindows, which ended (interestingly) with Microsoft buying the name from them.<p>I was curious of exactly when the trademark was applied for and given, and was astonished how late (and mysterious) it was:<p><a href=""http://www.geek.com/news/suit-seeks-to-strip-ms-of-windows-trademark-552275/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geek.com/news/suit-seeks-to-strip-ms-of-windows-t...</a>",1377320050

The insurance industry is the boring financial industry, but is very vast with many nooks and crannies. The companies are making financial gambles estimating risk. And not every company has the same model or the same strategy. Some risks pay off, and sometimes they don&#x27;t. And from what I understand, in the property and casualty business, the profit the companies make typically comes from investments of their capital and not their loss rates.<p>If you don&#x27;t see the value of insurance, then don&#x27;t buy it unless the law requires. And if you don&#x27;t like the law, then do something about it.<p>But if you&#x27;re family has money, or if you do, it would be smart to put a few bucks into your insurance policy and relax knowing that your capital is not at risk.

So, it was held as evidence of the Obama administration wasting tax payer money during a recession.<p>Now, Tesla is trying to sell vehicles around the traditional car dealer system.

6267657,comment,6259391,6265741,1,0,mtdewcmu,,,"Irrational numbers, by definition, include decimal numbers that have infinitely many digits after the decimal point, and there are no rules about what those digits have to be. This is powerful enough to represent any irrational number regardless of the number base. However, if you&#x27;re talking about number systems, not all number systems have equal ability to represent irrational numbers. Whatever the system, to represent all the irrationals, it would have to be capable of going on forever. I think the part of my point that you&#x27;re asking about is my statement that they&#x27;re a side effect of decimal numbers. Irrational numbers like sqrt(2) and e have concise representations as the limits of Taylor series. Only when converted into decimals do they appear to have infinite amounts of information. So if we used Taylor series as the number system instead of decimals, simple irrationals would look simple, and we might be less inclined to treat them the same as numbers that have no finite descriptions at all.",1377319468

Flow-based languages didn&#x27;t catch on because no-one came up with a really compelling general-purpose implementation that scales up to large, complex projects. It&#x27;s not because it was actively suppressed by the programmer Illuminati to keep our salaries high.<p>I think the main reason FBP hasn&#x27;t gone mainstream is because most implementations are built around a graphical programming environments (e.g. LabView, Pure Data, Scratch) in order to cater to non-programmers. But programmers love their text files, and for plenty of good reasons. Code represented as text can be edited by any general-purpose text editor, work well with version control systems, and can (usually) be easily split into separate files.<p>It&#x27;s probably instructive, then, to look at a domain in which textual flow-based programming languages have become mainstream. I&#x27;m speaking, of course, about Hardware Description Languages, which are used by digital circuit designers to simulate and prototype complex circuits, like CPUs. The two dominant HDLs are VHDL and Verilog. Both of these languages use a flow-based model, in which logical blocks called entities are connected to each other through input and output ports. The reason these languages work is because the domain is a good fit for FBP and because they are designed for the domain experts (circuit designers) to use, and not for some non-technical manager to be able to understand.<p>Taking a similar approach to web programming may work. Logical blocks connected through ports. Except instead of ones and zeroes going through these ports, you have I/O events and data. I haven&#x27;t looked at NoFlo, but it might be interesting.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not saying that VHDL and Verilog are good languages, even for their intended domain. They have plenty of warts, and a FBP language for software that basically copies one or the other would be terrible (especially VHDL; oh god, please nobody make VHDL for web programming). But the entity-port model is essentially sound, and I would be quite interested in a general-purpose language that adapts that model in a well thought-out way.",1377317721

I can make a user interface that&#x27;s functional and effective.<p>What I can&#x27;t do is make a visually appealing web site.  For years I&#x27;ve been telling myself that that&#x27;s just not something I&#x27;m able to do - after all, my strength is in back-end systems.  But recently I realized that I&#x27;d never actually tried to do so. I&#x27;ve just assumed that I couldn&#x27;t because I tend towards more functional UIs. I have no specific reason for wanting to learn this, other than challenging my own assumptions about myself.<p>Of course I&#x27;ve looked online, but most of what I turn up are links to sites that promise to teach me everything[1], or top-10 lists]2], or tutorials on how to write HTML[3] and javascript [4]. I find plenty of offers to host my site[5], how to build easy sites with someone else&#x27;s cheesy templates, how to bring a site online quickly with flavor-of-the-year, and a dozen other  things.<p>The remainder appears to be opinions stated forcefully as facts -- with all the fervor of any great religious debate.<p>So I ask you this: are there good resources that teach the basics of web site design, and how to implement such designs using stable tools?  What about at a higher level -- verifiable discussions of proven designs, along with studies or information about the effectiveness of recent trends (like half-page carousels and &#x27;cleverly&#x27; hiding multiple pages behind vertical scrolling).<p>[1] for a not-so-small fee [2] links to adfarms [3] I know it reasonably well[4] I&#x27;m quite comfortable with the language itself [5] Have it already [7] both of these trends I find personally distasteful but are they effective?",1377317439

Part of Ballmer/Brummel&#x27;s trouble is that they couldn&#x27;t seem to recognize who was honestly contributing versus who was parasite, or an under-performer, or someone toxic who was pushing out good people to serve their personal gain.",1377317438

It guarantees that some teams will have bottom-performers, since a team without bottom-performers will fire or scare away the lowest in the team.  Furthermore you incentivize sabotaging your teammates and--even if nobody does it--that makes everyone suspicious of their teammates.<p>If there were a magical wand I could wave to nearly perfectly rank all the employees at a company I were running, I would do it and base compensation off of it.

We&#x27;ll be running tests with ourselves and our early community to make some best practices, but there is no rule that keeps you from writing most of your logic in one block. Our theory is that the graph-based view will encourage encapsulation in different ways that make sense for the different domains that adopt the tool.<p>One of the big design differences (vs Quartz Composer, Lab View, Pure Data) is that it will be easy to dive in and edit component code and make new components when needed.",1377316989

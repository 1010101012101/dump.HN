It suffers from similar issues that a lot of html-to-pdf-based tools (although I assume it&#x27;s sgml-to-pdf in this case?) -- horrible breaks, and it also &quot;feels&quot; wrong wrt. some spacing/etc. Generally standard LaTeX will look (much) better than this without tweaking, IMNHO.<p>On the other hand, they also have an epub style sheet, and it appears (a little oddly) that the layout of the epub is better than the pdf.<p>FWIW most &quot;heavily optimized&quot; custom LaTeX styles I&#x27;ve come across tend to feel like being slapped in the face with MS Word -- and I think I&#x27;ve yet to encounter <i>any</i> that actually improve on the &quot;standard&quot; styles in any meaningful way (with possible exception of the APA style, which is ugly, but as it has to conform to APA, it&#x27;s ugly by design. And looks better than most other APA conforming styles I&#x27;ve seen).<p>Still, having a starting point makes the job much easier -- so this is a great resource.",1426409933

Big talks about the next cool app, and raising money from VC coz I went to Y school and know Z. One of the apps that won was a chat app for hackers in 2014. There were some good people too, but they were hard to find and very few. Since then I have started moving away from the so-called hacker culture and just ignore hackathons. Fundamentally the whole concept of hackathon just sounds bad to me now. You code and don&#x27;t sleep or sleep in some random place at random time. I would take good sleep any day over learning some fancy new technology. I would prefer hackathons to be more where a set of people show something interesting they have built and then people can discuss merits/demerits and start contributing to them.

Opportunity exists everywhere, but we as insiders with our vast technical knowledge are distracted by our awe of capability. We fail to exploit the low hanging fruit that a capitalist might immediately sense. We would rather pursue deeper knowledge within our domain to be masters of our craft.<p>People selling cell phone mods don&#x27;t usually know anything about electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or manufacturing; yet they somehow can pull millions of dollars of profits out of plastic cases and LED mods simply by dangling a few slices of pizza in front of a hungry college student.<p>Point is, exploitation is everywhere -- don&#x27;t be exploited, and computer science is at the stage where it&#x27;s simple enough to follow some rules and slap a few APIs together to build a decent mash-up that&#x27;s never existed before... that a fraction of people are willing to pay for, and &quot;make bank bro&quot;.<p>I hate it.

Right now I&#x27;m working on writing a operating system. It&#x27;s been somewhat successful so far, but as operating systems are a deep and complex field, and I&#x27;m definitely still learning, there&#x27;s a lot of embarrassing mistakes and bad code throughout the git log. For example, I just recently learned how to properly write makefiles , and a day on my project was just on writing a somewhat simple in hindsight makefile (because I was reading the man page at the same time). Should I just not host said projects on my github?<p>Also, when you look at a github profile, what do you look at?

9205833,comment,9203763,9204278,0,0,dang,,,"Sorry for the late reply—I wanted to give you a serious answer and didn&#x27;t have time earlier.<p>The criteria for &quot;substantive&quot; are what the HN guidelines (along with <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html</a>) say about which stories are on topic: intellectually interesting (as opposed to sensational) and so on. HN&#x27;s culture is well-enough established by now that I think most community members can probably agree, not of course on what interests each of us personally, but on a working set of candidate stories that roughly fit the criteria. That&#x27;s our hypothesis, anyhow.<p>HN sees perhaps a thousand new stories a day. Most aren&#x27;t &quot;intellectually interesting&quot; in HN&#x27;s sense (i.e. gratifying intellectual curiosity), and the weeds have grown too thick for the upvote system alone to reliably surface the potential gems. To comb through /newest looking for them has become too much work.<p>Some interesting stories (again, &quot;interesting&quot; in the HN sense) do fine under the upvote system. Breaking news, stories about fashionable technologies, and anything controversial reliably attract upvotes. But the quieter and deeper submissions are often not immediately recognizable. Those deserve closer attention than they were getting, so we&#x27;ve been experimenting with different approaches to finding them.<p>In the spirit of &quot;do things that don&#x27;t scale&quot;, it&#x27;s mostly us trying different things manually for now, but what we&#x27;re looking for is a mechanism that can be opened to anyone willing to put in the effort. The upvote system will work exactly as it always has, but we&#x27;re hoping to add a new one that complements it and compensates for its weaknesses.<p>Since it requires significant effort to look through the story stream hunting for out-of-the-way pieces, one idea (my favorite) is to make this a new way of earning karma on the site.

However you can implement a VM (or mode) which supports only a subset of JS with some of the legacy cruft removed. Strongscript is a step in this direction. (Side note - deprecate a few more features and you can start reusing some of the optimisations in the Dart VM.)<p>It is also possible to treat JS source as an AST serialization format an to display code differently when viewed by the developer. When language semantics are close to 1:1 this can work seamlessly (unlike of the big unintelligible balls of source required to work around ES5 semantic gaps).<p>And who knows, give it 10 years, and perhaps TC39 members will agree on a new language syntax that fits the existing &quot;use strong&quot; semantics. Note there is no need for expensive new VMs in this scenario, it is just a new parser generating AST nodes in the existing VM. This seems pretty obvious, I mean it&#x27;s a bit of cruel joke to make developers use === for the next few decades. Surely this can be fixed some day.<p>Forgive my naivety about TC39 and standards, but I would have thought when standardising a new language feature that it makes sense to review similar features in other languages, and to perhaps reach out to implementers, for a presentation, or at least some email discussion. Seems prudent to learn from other&#x27;s mistakes.<p>Btw. It is trivial to statically analyse Dart code, and even ignoring type annotations, decide whether a number literal is an integer or a double. And yes such automatic translation wouldn&#x27;t be possible until changes like strongscript and bignums have landed in ES. But perhaps I misunderstand your point.",1426407221

They have managed to skew the market in their favour by artificially lowering the overall cost of using their services and artificially raising the cost of connecting to competing services. You can&#x27;t have your free market cake on one end of the argument and eat it on the other. Either you&#x27;re in favour of free markets at both ends, or you aren&#x27;t.<p>Yes there is a market for ISP access and consumers are free to chose another. That&#x27;s fair. Nobody is arguing this is illegal, it not even necessarily immoral for the people that made the deal. It&#x27;s just business and companies give away freebies all the time for all sorts of reasons. The problem comes if this becomes standard practice, because at that point you don&#x27;t have an open market anymore, you have an industry cartel that has stitched up the market to divide it up between themselves.

That&#x27;s also why they did work on a compiler that they did get something useful out of (they have since switched their compiler approach to making an LLVM backend instead).<p>But getting to a point where you can run it in silicon (even just as an FPGA) is a long, tough slog.

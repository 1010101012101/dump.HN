The NFL mostly stacks their games on Sunday so &quot;football sunday&quot; has become a social event for people. Leagues like the MLB, NBA and NHL spread their games all over the week and with modern cable packages on pretty much any given day you can find a game to watch - the specialness is lost.<p>This is one reason why I think it&#x27;s a bad idea for the NFL to start spreading games around - sure there was always MNF but they&#x27;ve had TNF now for a while and there&#x27;s always talk about adding more. They want those primetime slots but all it does is weaken The Event effect of sundays.",1424818782

One of the biggest problems is that there is not enough knowledge in general society yet for markets to work well enough wrt privacy.

9104152,comment,9102110,9102110,0,0,devindotcom,,,"I love things like this.<p>In my old Dreamcast, I found after I&#x27;d packed it up and moved it a few too many times that it wouldn&#x27;t start, but would show signs of life when the lid would open and close. I found that there was a position you could put the lid in at which it would boot, and that position could be reliably reached if a SweeTart was placed in the tray near the edge of the disc. I licked the flat side of the SweeTart a few times and it stayed where it was, and it&#x27;s there to this day. Of course, the lock doesn&#x27;t engage so I have to keep something heavy on top of it.<p>And on my PS2, I&#x27;d fiddled around with it too much trying to mod it, and messed up something in there, but not bad enough that it wouldn&#x27;t boot and play a game. But about 3/4 of the way through Resident Evil 4, I found it would skip and eventually reset if you didn&#x27;t tilt it up by 20 degrees or so. As I progressed in the game, the angle at which it had to be set increased, until eventually not only did it have to be tilted in a second direction as well. Believe it or not, it finally reached the point where no tilt could save it in the middle of the final boss, with my friend moving it this way and that like we were trying to get reception with bunny ears on an old TV. I never beat the game.",1424818761

9104148,comment,9098175,9102220,0,0,lmm,,,"> That cause is not pre-graduation -- its effect is. Low participation in the industry causes fewer women to be drawn to the field, to be less interested in math etc.<p>If it&#x27;s just that kind of feedback loop, how would the fall have started? Mathematics was once almost exclusively a men&#x27;s game and early computer science fell in with that; the kids of the &#x27;80s would have had more female role models in the computer industry (and certainly as you say more in biology or physics) than those of the &#x27;70s or &#x27;60s, so why would they have been less interested in numerate fields?<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the feedback loop you describe can&#x27;t amplify things, but I think the underlying cause has to lie outside it.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking more about your decline-since-the-80s point. The narrative I&#x27;ve heard most often is that &#x27;90s compsci classes contained women with lower GRE-type scores than men (either through explicit positive discrimination/affirmative action, or because there were plenty of applicants who passed the admission criteria and a roughly-even split were accepted), who went on to do less well in industry (in line with their GRE-type scores), and the crash of the early &#x27;00s prompted an adjustment to more natural levels. But that leaves a lot of unexplained questions.<p>Maybe Yvain&#x27;s page is right about academia, but those results don&#x27;t extend to SV where there is more outright discrimination? Maybe it&#x27;s about men being more able or willing than women to move to SV? Maybe SV&#x27;s standards are stricter than the GRE cutoff and the difference at the end of the bell curve is even starker?<p>I still feel like we must be missing something. The simplistic explanation of &quot;it&#x27;s all innate ability&quot; doesn&#x27;t fit, but neither does &quot;it&#x27;s all discrimination/hostility&quot;, nor even &quot;it&#x27;s a 50/50 split between the two&quot;. Something remains to be explained here.",1424818702

9104145,comment,9101094,9103800,0,0,RockyMcNuts,,,"Von Neumann and Morgenstern showed that, as long as people can consistently order choices (ordinal utility), there is a utility function (cardinal utility) they are satisfying.<p>What Kahneman and Tversky observed is that people don&#x27;t even choose consistently. It depends on how the choices are presented. For instance, whether the subject frames an outcome as a loss or a smaller-than-expected gain. No matter how you define a utility function, it will not always be maximized. So, it&#x27;s not a question of defining the function less narrowly. You can present two games with mathematically identical sets of outcomes and people consistently rank the outcomes differently.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s a very good and important book, and doesn&#x27;t have much to do with Bayesian statistics.<p>[Ninja-edited since HN doesn&#x27;t let me respond further below...if you can show the outcomes K & T observed are in fact consistent with a more broadly defined utility function, then you too can win a Nobel prize!]",1424818646

Say one twin grows up in a nutrient-rich environment while another grows up in a nutrient-poor environment. The nutrient-poor twin will most likely have more developmental issues than the nutrient-rich twin, which can have a wide variety of effects. Perhaps a model trained on more data would be more accurate, but I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it.",1424818225

What does an employer offer you?  Security?  Nope.  Pension?  Nope.  Predictable income?  Nope.  Companies have abandoned absolutely every single thing they ever offered to employees.  They stagger along now just because people go to them out of habit.<p>Companies first came around because someone has to solve the distribution problem.  That was such a valuable problem to solve that it shaped commerce and society for well over 100 years.  It still shapes society.  And it shouldn&#x27;t.  The Internet solves the distribution problem.  It makes it so any 12 year old with a net connection can run circles around any mega-corporation when it comes to distributing product from point A to point B.  The only place the 12 year old CAN&#x27;T beat the corporation is the place that large corporations never really managed to penetrate much in the first place - goods and service which are actually intrinsically bound to geography.  You need your hair stylist to be physically near you.  You need the plumber to be near you.  And those people do not work for a mega-multinational.<p>And I expect when the change happens, it will only take a matter of weeks or months.  There will be a sudden realization on all sides.  Companies will realize they can&#x27;t get ridiculously profitable workers for dirt cheap any more.  Workers will realize their company has been playing them like a game - and realize that if they play the company at the same game instead of listening to myths their parents told them - they will kick ass any time.<p>Zero overhead, zero debt and obligations going up against a large organization who relies COMPLETELY on the ability to hire workers who will accept pay less than 5% of the value they actually earn for the company?

Indeed, if we assume rational miners with accurate price predictions, then <i>the amount wasted on mining Bitcoin always exactly equals the total value of bitcoins in circulation</i>.<p>(So far we don&#x27;t see this because the price is much higher now than it was when most of the coins in circulation were mined. On the other hand, if the Bitcoin price drops to e.g. $10, then the current expenditure on ASICs is going to look even more extravagantly wasteful).<p>> You&#x27;re right that Bitcoin by nature includes a huge energy cost, but when you take the narrow view that it&#x27;s simply being thrown away, it&#x27;s both short-sighted that it ignores the theoretical possibility that its heat &quot;waste&quot; could be channeled into something economically desirable (e.g. steam to drive turbines)<p>Even if you find a way to use the heat, you&#x27;re wasting the computational power that could be allocated to something more productive e.g. protein folding.<p>But even more importantly, and what I expected to be half the point of the article, the work put into validating the blockchain inherently <i>has</i> to be wasteful. If it isn&#x27;t, the economic incentives against cheating no longer apply - you can just do a leveraged buyout of a huge turbine company, put their heat generators to work doing a 51% attack, and double-spend all your bitcoins.<p>Whenever someone comes up with a way to do hashing for half the energy, the Bitcoin network doesn&#x27;t start using half as much energy - it starts doing twice as much hashing. The wastefulness is built-in and unavoidable.",1424817501

SmugMug staff should be concerned...<p>There are 2 types of fall protection rigging setups for this corner of the building scenario - Fall Arrest & Fall Restraint. Both have to do with the ability of the person to go &quot;over the edge&quot; in the case of a fall.<p>Fall Arrest is when the person has fallen over the edge of the building and they are arrested with the rigging equipment from falling and hitting the pavement 1,000 feet below.<p>Fall Restraint is a rigging system that restrains the person from falling over the edge in the first place.<p>From the video and photos it looks like Von Wong is a bit of a wahoo adrenalin nut[0] and though he and the team had good safety intentions, there are some serious safety issues I would like to point out. And next time please contact me so we can do this safely.<p>I am going to use this photo[1] and this photo[2] to point out safety flaws.<p>In these photos I see an Anchor on the I-beam (photo[1] left image red friction protection), a rock climbing harness for Body Ware, I see the connector with webbing, but I don&#x27;t see a deceleration device.  A fall arrest system consists of 4 items ABCD: Anchor, Body Ware, Connector & Deceleration Device.  From this setup i&#x27;ll assume the rigging plan was to build a fall restraint system to prevent their subjects from falling over the edge because there is no deceleration device.<p>There are just a few problems with this logic that lead to serious safety concerns. As we can see in photo[2] there is:<p>a) a hand holding the webbing &quot;preventing&quot; a fall, this is not a fall restraint system, it adds slack to the system that increases forces in the case of a fall (this is more apparent in the .gif: <a href=""http://www.vonwong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1-VbFFSy7FKJHCNTgayZTQeQ.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vonwong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1-VbF...</a>
You can see the black rope coiled up and moving, not cool. EDIT: It looks like the subject is attached via lanyard to the &quot;safety&quot; guy. In the case of a fall he is in the system preventing himself from performing a rescue.<p>b) the subject could fall off either side of the &quot;point&quot; of the building as the anchor is not around the I-beam in the frame, but out of frame to the right (making the length of the lanyard longer and increasing the force of the fall especially if she fell to the right)<p>c) that granite edge acts as a knife and webbing doesn&#x27;t stand a chance being dragged across it if they fall over the edge,<p>d) because this is a fall arrest scenario there are serious forces on the system if the subject falls over the edge, especially if they are standing up! (the higher they are above the anchor the more potential energy they have).<p>These are really interesting photos, just when you do them be smart and rig it correctly.<p>[0]<a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/O32BWH3s0qkaAheqLeEQXSqxZkrVUsQrZ6GnuPKXM9fW9uzryjJM9MCXFS0qoaBW"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/O32BWH3s0qkaA...</a><p>[1]<a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/CG8GkzYscTabCnMS6nGxjgiE71vqOp6d0w03OkAnSJ69NY02vbVTFiuPjU7JkPpV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/CG8GkzYscTabC...</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/8NXYjfzC6a5RVcQTXuS2gP88SfIQA2372T66ZtMmJVhPndWTPLQCOp0O7WSTgksw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/8NXYjfzC6a5RV...</a>",1424816499

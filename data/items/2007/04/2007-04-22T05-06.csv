I'll show my results by April 30th.<p>#3 and #4 mean a desktop app. I may consider that in the future but right now, web only. Sorry.<p>By #2/6 do you mean using AJAX?",1177221526

To answer your question, there were actually 7 video submissions in the past 24 hours between Google and YouTube alone.  Had I known you were interested in videos, I would have e-mailed them to you so you wouldn't miss them.<p>Had there been a video section, nobody would have thought there were only 2 videos submitted in the past few days.<p>Please let me know if you have any other questions!",1177221403

As he says himself, he ""must be the worst communicator"" (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=15510"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=15510</a> )-- e.g., witness the really inappropriate Nazi reference in the title to this thread. <p>Sometimes I find myself wondering if this reflects a major cultural difference he's just not grasping fully? Or just a strange variation on John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory (the ""Mahir Corollary?"")?

15615,comment,15543,15609,0,0,bootload,,,"'<i>... Simple answer: yes... build a matrix of friends/enemies/etc and iterate over it until you have absolute values ...'</i> <p>Slashdot tried a model similar to this. The result you still got polarisation of views, short snipes without any real value.  I don't think it's simple. Why? You  can't change ""human behaviour"".  Anything you do there will be some person trying to find a loophole. Joshua Schachter (delicious fame) went into great lengths in his talk on itconversation about this.<p>Especially just with an algorythm approach.  Though one thing I can think of that did more than anything for me was a points filter (meaning you can simply not view someones comments below a certain threshold ) . A more broader approach has better chances of encouraging (enforcing) good behaviour.<p>One successful approach I have seen, can be found in the <i>perlmonks</i> (a perl programming) site where users gain karma through numerous means (time on the system, posts and moderation) enforced by a top down 'Benovolent dictatorship'  and in effect a hierarchy. <p>You join the site as a novice & work your way up earning rights through encouraged & enforced behaviour. For instance you have to be a certain level (say level 5) before you can front-page a post. Another level and you can join groups effecting the design of the site.   This type of conditioning means for instance users don't have power beyond their maturity. If they do things <i>out-of-line</i> (say for instance random down-modding or excessive referencing) they can be pulled in before the inevitable <i>kitten fights</i> (al-la slashdot) begins.   <p>In time, as a user reaches a certain level (of maturity) certain rights are allowed. So the combination of brute user moderation and a more subtle framework encourages finding solutions to problems rather than /. type brawls. <p>I don't think mere code alone solves undesirable behaviour in systems. And it would be a good area for developers with a 'psychology', 'group dynamics' background to explore and add more knowledge.",1177219873

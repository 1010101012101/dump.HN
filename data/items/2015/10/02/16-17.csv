I think the relational model (and document model) lead to the need for lots of manual traversal/management of the graph/hierarchy of a domain model.<p>And, in an OOP sense, models have behavior (and of course state).<p>But behavior involves mutating the state of one domain object and others, via their public API (behaviors).  Yet most of the so-called behaviors are actually just adding/changing nodes/edges to the graph, which makes the model&#x27;s main behavior data validation.<p>So we have this elaborate, tightly-coupled system that pretty much only does data validation, but via the elaborate mechanism of object behavior and internal state.<p>The typical test suite tests the propagation of this data through the system and verifies that the proper object state has been mutated/persisted, since the proper functioning of the system is easy to doubt.",1443805172

Namely the impossibility to solve Halting problem. But CSS is deterministic and a CSS &quot;program&quot; always halts.<p>&quot;But, but, we are making an <i>assumption</i> that a user has to click this particular button until the page doesn&#x27;t change anymore (assuming infinitely long page [1])&quot;<p>To which I say, poppycock. The purpose of CSS language is to apply styles to the webpage. Once it is processed, the CSS &quot;program&quot; has done it&#x27;s purpose and is finished (i.e. halted). Running the same CSS &quot;program&quot; over and over again until it consistently produces identical results is not the point of CSS (unlike, say LaTeX/BibTeX compilation process, where you need to compile one file several times to get citation page numbers right, which <i>is</i> Turing complete). You might want to call it something else, like RCSS (repeated CSS). Then, RCSS is Turing complete, but plain CSS isn&#x27;t. Much like a calculator that can calculate z^2 + C isn&#x27;t necessarily Turing complete, while a graphical calculator that can draw a Mandelbrot fractal by iterating that formula is.<p>[1] which is acceptable, due to infinite memory assumption of a regular Turing machine",1443805106

10319572,comment,10318729,10319183,0,0,mfenniak,,,"At Replicon, a SaaS timesheet provider, we started supporting Python scripting a couple years ago.  At first, it was a component of the application we called &quot;pay rules&quot;, which are basically the rules that determine how much regular time, over time, double time, etc. an individual is being paid based upon their timesheets.  These rules are very different from locale to locale, and at times can be very complex.<p>The scripting started pretty simple; one script type.  It has access to all of our web services, and runs &quot;as the user&quot; but under a specific fixed permission set.  The permission set limits the script to read-only services.  It is passed simple data: a timesheet reference, and a user.  It returns simple data: an array of dates, pay codes, and amounts to be paid.  The scripts run under IronPython, so we&#x27;re able to use .NET&#x27;s security to prevent the script from accessing the file-system, network, etc.  As an additional precaution, the scripts are run on isolated servers that are firewalled to only have network access to the web services servers, and importantly not the database servers or the Internet.  Whenever a timesheet is updated, the pay output for that timesheet is marked as &quot;needs recalculation&quot;, and the script is executed in a background task.<p>It was an ugly roll-out.  Our first large customer ran into a ton of intermittent errors, which resulted in stale data calculations being used in actual payroll runs.  But we fixed these problems quickly, and it&#x27;s been incredibly smooth after that first month of hell.<p>And it was very successful.  Its success lead to using scripts more and more for other parts of our application, which gives us some incredible per-tenant flexibility while maintaining a single core application.  We&#x27;ve followed a few major rules that have helped:<p>(a) Scripts always do read-only operations; they can never access services that write data.  This makes development of the scripts simple because they can be executed with no side-effects, which we leverage in the form of a script simulator that we provide in the UI.<p>(b) Scripts always have simple inputs, simple outputs.  This is tricky every time we create a new type of script.  We&#x27;ve found that the less we feed into the script as an input, the more it has to use services to retrieve data, which is actually a fantastically flexible approach.  And the same with data output; it needs to contain the results of a calculation, which the script host then does stuff with.<p>(c) Background execution is far better than interactive execution.  We design for background calculations now, making the UI show that &quot;this is being calculated&quot;, and preventing certain operations while data is stale.  This makes it easy to scale up and down our script servers, and the occasional badly written script doesn&#x27;t have much of an impact outside of the specific tenant trying to use it.<p>Overall, the approach IS somewhat crazy.  It&#x27;s a lot more work than just implementing your product the way you want it to work.  But for &quot;enterprise customizability&quot;, it rocks.",1443803820

So wave function propagates through the two slits in double slit experiment and the two resulting waves collide just like water waves would passing though the slits with the resulting troughs and crests of the wave function (remember this is complex valued function whose absolute value squared is the probability that particle is located at that location in space).<p>So, in the quantum model, what is &quot;waving&quot; and spreading through space is in a way a probability of the particle being there.<p>This explanation is very rough and contains a lot of inaccuracies (you really have to look at the math to know what is really going on) but it does give you some flavor of what is going on.",1443803668

There are clearly &quot;arbitrage&quot; opportunities that HFT firms consistently profit from. However, by definition, those arb opportunities will either be taken by someone else, or enough people will run into grab them such that the arb goes to zero. If there are consistent arb opportunities then something needs to change - namely the regulation which structures the market and allows people to take consistent advantage of it. Thus new regulation is issued and the market, inherently a complex and intricate system, becomes stronger as a result. This is maybe where the value to society lies. and maybe this is an idealistic view of how regulation, society and HFT interact in this case.... ?",1443803632

So you are in fact not free to do this, if you have a boss above you who cares dearly about the company steering clear of hot water.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to testify as a technical expert in a court of law that the GPL cannot reasonably rule out dynamic linking; that dynamic linking to a program is a form of <i>use</i> (like invoking a command line and passing it arguments) and not <i>integration</i>.  The proof is that dynamically linked components can be replaced by clean-room substitutes which work exactly alike, or at least well enough so that the main software can function.<p>For example, a program can be shipped with a stub library which behaves like GNU Readline (but perhaps doesn&#x27;t have all its features). The users themselves can replace that with a GNU Readline library. Thus, the program&#x27;s vendor isn&#x27;t even redistributing the GPL&#x27;ed component.

The top Eng., law, medicine schools & colleges are publicly-run & free, while the top business schools will typically relieve you of 10K/year<p>On the flipside, you pay significant taxes on the announced salary.

The fitness expert explained to the studio audience that the quick fixes lauded by late-night infomercials didn&#x27;t work and that they weren&#x27;t sustainable. He said that what we really need are simple <i>lifestyle</i> fixes that do not require us to change our natural tendencies, changes that make an impact before we have a chance to screw it up with our unhealthy food choices. And his first suggestion? Smaller plates.<p>Now riveted, I watched as the man explained that our natural human behavior is to fill our plates with food and, because Mom said so, clean that plate right up by eating everything on it. I still don&#x27;t get Mom&#x27;s logic--there are children starving in Africa, so I need to get fat? But the &quot;clean-your-plate club&quot; was instilled in me and probably in you, too. The message is ingrained. Changing that habit for a day is a no-brainer. But changing it permanently? That&#x27;s hard. Some would say it&#x27;s nearly impossible. This is why so many people who diet gain the weight back, why people rarely follow through on New Year&#x27;s resolutions past the end of January, and why it&#x27;s so difficult to be disciplined with your spending.<p>As I continued to watch the program, the expert went on to say that rather than work to change our &quot;eat everything on the plate&quot; behavior we simply need to change the size of our plates. When we use smaller plates, we dish out smaller portions, thus eating fewer calories while continuing our natural human behavior of serving a full plate and eating all of what is served.<p>...<p>A 2012 report by Koert Van Ittersum and Brian Wansink in the Journal of Consumer Research identifies the average plate size in America as having grown 23% between the years 1900 and 2012, from 9.6 inches to 11.8 inches. Running the math, the article explains that, should this increase in plate size encourage an individual to consume just fifty more calories per day, that person would put on an extra five pounds of weight... each year. Year after year, that adds up&quot; [1]<p>Start will smaller plates and work on disciplining yourself to only one plate.<p>[1] Profit First: A simple System to Transform Any Business from a Cash-Eating Monster to a Money-Making Machine by Mike Michalowicz ( <a href=""http://amzn.to/1RkuTIO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/1RkuTIO</a> affiliate link )",1443802713

Noticed a mention of find and cpio. So wanted to say:<p>find, in general, is quite a powerful command [1], and one of the ways of using it, is piping its output to cpio or other commands, to act upon the found filenames (which can include relative or full paths, depending on how you call find). There is also the -exec option to find, which can do more or less what I said above (piping find&#x27;s output to other commands), but without using a pipeline.<p>Those are some good reasons why you might want to persevere and learn to use find, despite its awkward syntax. And it&#x27;s not really that difficult.<p>[1] One such example is a command I used to use a lot: some variation on piping the output of find to cpio, using the -p option of cpio (for pass, IIRC). E.g.:<p>$ find . -name some_wildcard -print | cpio -pdmuv dirname<p>which would copy an entire directory subtree from one place in the file system to another (or to a place (directory) in a different file system too). (Something like XCOPY ... /s /v /e in DOS.) And those cpio options could be used to do things like keeping the permissions of the target files the same as those of the source, or not, etc. Imagine how much time that could save (over having to later manually change the permissions, after the copy, particularly when there are many files). And that&#x27;s just one example of the power of fin (along with other Unix commands).",1443802690

(This is, of course, an oversimplification).<p>Now, the rhetoric we&#x27;ve been throwing at kids to get them to go to college has been strongly on the &quot;skills&quot; side of things, which is perhaps why you (and others) feel that colleges aren&#x27;t focusing on what they should.<p>As far as fundraising is concerned, it&#x27;s complicated. You have to do something to keep the doors open and the lights on.

Money in the endowment means less of a dependence on tuition, which means more stability in the face of possible enrollment shortfalls.<p>Something like an art museum serves multiple purposes. It&#x27;s an amenity, sure, and may help students (or their parents) decide that this institution is the right place for them. If there is an art or art history department, it may serve pedagogical functions. In many cases, though, donors may have given significant amounts of art to the school, and they need a way to respond to that gift. Having a museum to put it in makes everyone happy.<p>[1] Sorum, C.

There are really two problems in the model layer of a database-based app:<p>- Moving data into and out of the database, the &quot;Data Access Layer&quot;<p>- How the model objects interact and behave once moved into memory, the &quot;Domain Model&quot;; this is pure OO and is amenable to fast, in-memory-only testing.<p>Rails treats these two as a single layer. On a project I&#x27;m working on now, we separated them into two distinct layers, which allows 1-2ms test execution in the model layer. We do test persistence, and it takes some time, but we can be a lot sparser with these slow, heavy tests.<p>In the end I think the choice of approach depends on how complex the domain model is. My domain has almost 100 objects arranged in various ways, putting us over the threshold where persistence should be treated as its own concern (vs. bundling it into the model). I suspect a lot of apps are better done via the Rails approach as it&#x27;s much simpler, if slower to test.",1443802051

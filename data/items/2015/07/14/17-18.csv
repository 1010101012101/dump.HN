9886800,comment,9883246,9885498,0,0,techwizrd,,,"Just out of curiosity, how will removing Pocket integration and Hello (a thin UI over WebRTC) personally? Both are lazy-loaded, so the only bloat they add is &quot;visual bloat&quot;. This behavior is seriously disappointing from the Firefox community.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Pocket since it was Read It Later and I was pleased to see it integrated into the browser. Mozilla is working on a Reader mode[0] but it does not seem to be ready for public consumption yet (despite landing in 2012). Most people don&#x27;t even know it exists, and it obviously does not save it for later (unless you bookmark it). The implementation is open-source (MPL license), although Pocket itself is proprietary. Hotword detection is not absolutely necessary for browser functionality, yet I hear no chorus of complaints from Chrome users. Should Mozilla be prohibited from partnering with proprietary third-parties whether or not it benefits their users?<p>Hello is even less of an argument. Firefox Hello is a simple Javascript UI for the existing WebRTC spec supported by Firefox, Chrome, and Opera[1]. It allows people to communicate without having to set up accounts, sign-in somewhere, and works against the platform lock-in of proprietary services such as Facetime, Hangouts, and Skype. If it&#x27;s disabled by default, the service becomes useless. My parents shouldn&#x27;t have to enable it about:config for me to talk to them, nor should they have to download another plugin to use a technology built-in to the browser. I understand the security implications[2] in IP leakage[3], but I don&#x27;t see a simple fix that doesn&#x27;t neuter the functionality (although this comes close[4]). W3C has stated their position on fingerprinting[5], but at least Mozilla is actively working on the issue.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.ghacks.net/2015/02/07/mozilla-starts-to-push-reader-mode-to-desktop-firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ghacks.net/2015/02/07/mozilla-starts-to-push-read...</a><p>1: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/which-browsers-will-work-firefox-hello-video-chat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/which-browsers-will-wor...</a><p>2: <a href=""https://twitter.com/incloud/status/619624021123010560"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/incloud/status/619624021123010560</a><p>3: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=959893"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=959893</a><p>4: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/statutory/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/statutory/</a><p>5: <a href=""https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/blob/master/2015/05/fingerprint.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/blob/master/2015/05/f...</a>",1436896763

Chris Harris (a well respected automotive journalist) listed this as a chief complaint about his E92 M3 (the V8 powered car). I just drove my E92 M3 on a 2,000 mile road trip from Florida to Virginia, and I can empathize. The car managed 23 MPG on the highway, but I had to stop every 300 miles or so in order to fill up to avoid the anxiety of running out of fuel in heavy traffic where the car would average closer to 19 MPG. That still bests the Tesla&#x27;s range by a reasonable margin, but it&#x27;s enough to make M3 owners complain, so I could see it being an issue for potential Tesla buyers.",1436896665

I am not sure why either.<p>> A lot of privacy-aware users will expect Mozilla to provide a way to easily disable and remove what are essentially features tangential to the core functionality of the browser. By making it a feature integrated into the core Firefox, the users now have to jump through various hoops to come close to achieving that. Having it as an extension makes it much easier to do so.<p>The hops thing works both way. What is better to have features enabled and then those that do not like them disable them or the other way around? (genuine question). The thing is that Pocket is not doing anything there unless you use it. So if you&#x27;re not using it, then, its not actually working and removing it is two clicks away.<p>So, let me ask you a question, you prefer a browser where stuff is disabled by default and you enable them at your own will?

Denotational semantics does this in the most direct way, by giving me a mapping from programs to some abstract domain I can reason about and manipulate. It&#x27;s literally a function from program to meaning.<p>It exposes a simple and natural model of my program‚Äîor, in the case of imperative programming, perhaps not so simple. As a facetious example, what should the program &quot;1 + 1&quot; <i>mean</i>? Adding two numbers seems like the most natural choice. But this can actually scale up quite far, producing simple models even for complex behaviors[1] as long as the language and libraries are designed with some taste.<p>Having simple denotational semantics captures exactly what it means for a language to be truly <i>declarative</i>, where we can think about what the program means and not how it happens to be executed.<p>Operational semantics is the next most direct option. It captures the meaning of a program by how it gets executed. Not quite declarative, but still reasonably easy to follow.<p>Axiomatic semantics, on the other hand, are really indirect. I mean, yes, I can see how you can capture a program&#x27;s whole meaning by how preconditions are transformed throughout, but that&#x27;s pretty far from what I think a program <i>means</i>. It&#x27;s certainly useful and good for answering some very specific questions about a program&#x27;s behavior, but it feels like a really unsatisfying answer to the broader question of semantics: what <i>does</i> it all mean?<p>[1]: A great example of how it scales to domains that are normally incredibly difficult to work with is functional reactive programming (FRP), which has a simple denotational model for working with time-varying values (ie reactive code). Unfortunately, as is too-often the case with nice abstractions, it has been hard to implement in general without compromises‚Äîbut the nice thing is that we can know <i>exactly</i> what the compromises are by comparing the more complicated semantics of those libraries with the simple ones that we&#x27;d really like.",1436896097

Turning just sweet sixteen I did one myself as an &quot;Application Developer&quot; in the airline industry. This lasted four years and gave me some kind of diploma - not exactly a degree in CS, but I gained enough experience to get a well paid job with some responsibilities afterwards. During the apprenticeship the salary is more or less symbolic.\nNow at the age of 30 I&#x27;ve almost 10 years of experience in the real world, and never had any debt to pay off (although higher education is also very affordable in Switzerland). The nature of software engineering (e.g. contributing to open source projects, learning by doing, etc.), a sense of responsibility and a natural hunger for wisdom is in my experience enough material for a good position. Many of my friends, including myself, never did a bachelor or master degree but became great engineers and project leaders nevertheless. What often matters more than deep theoretical understanding is actually doing things such as dealing with pressure, deadlines and customers, getting along with a team and solving complex problems in an pragmatic way, because that&#x27;s what actually happens in most of the jobs. I don&#x27;t say this is the better way to go, instead I want to say that having a certain academic degree should not be seen as the only promising career path.",1436895832

Most low energy beta emitters basically have zero health risk.  Your internal organs are adequately shielded from it by nothing more than your own skin.  The danger in I-131 is that if you are iodine-deficient, you will readily absorb the iodine into your body and concentrate it in your thyroid.  Once there, it can zap your thyroid with high-energy electrons because it is sitting right there inside of it.  This type of radiation can be protected against by swallowing a pill of nonradioactive KI prior to exposure.<p>Radon-222 is an alpha-emitter.  Alphas are positively charged, so they too are stopped by very light shielding.  The greatest danger is from ionization and scattering, like a high-energy cue ball hitting a triangle of billiard balls which all plow through the back rail of the pool table.  The greatest danger is when the emitter is <i>inside</i> your body, such as stuck to the alveoli in your lungs--which is what would happen if you sat in a radon-rich spa for a while.<p>But in any case, the dose makes the poison, and if a radiation hormesis effect exists, good luck to the people wanting to prove it.  As for myself, I fear radiation itself far less than both the human who fears it beyond what is rational and the human who does not sufficiently respect its dangers.",1436895820

The IPv6 header is already twice as big as the IPv4 header, so the win in shrinking the TCP or UDP headers is extremely marginal.<p>2. No, the kernel IP handling code would get <i>more</i> complicated; since BSD Unix, the PCB code in the kernel has assumed sessions were organized by port numbers. Meanwhile: the underlying concept of a numeric mapping between applications and instances of protocols on the wire wouldn&#x27;t go away; you&#x27;d just be overloading IP addresses to accomplish it.<p>3. I agree that the opportunity to encode funny service names in hexadecimal trailing address space is an upside to eliminating ports.<p>4. Removing ports strictly simplifies network reconnaissance. IPv6 already makes scanning painful, whether or not you have TCP/UDP ports. With IPv6 and TCP ports, you have to do <i>both</i>: identify the live hosts, and <i>then</i> identify the listening ports on that host.<p>Some architectural downsides:<p>1. It is often (not always) helpful to distinguish between an entity providing a service and the services they provide. That distinction is lost when everything is an address.<p>2. Port numbers prevent us from accidentally trying to speak, say, RTP to a line-printer protocol server. Badly coded servers will often crash given random crap, and while that&#x27;s not dispositive (the priority should be &quot;eliminate badly coded servers), it&#x27;s a helpful feature of having ports.<p>3. The network is required to be aware of which end-systems own which addresses. They are not required to be aware of which applications are running on which end-systems. The end-to-end argument says: put the minimum amount of state in the network, leave as much up to the end system as possible.",1436894447

Some of the concepts and features were confusing to me based on my background in other languages (e.g. prototype objects, block scoping), but it looks like ES6/ES2015 addresses a lot of this. I&#x27;d love to diversify into web development and would like to learn it this way from the beginning.<p>I understand implementation is far from 100% yet, but I&#x27;d like to be ready for when it is far enough along for general use, sort of like when the general consensus was to start new Python projects in PY3K except for a few fringe cases.<p>Most of the books and other resources at Eric Douglas&#x27; ES6-Learning GitHub repo are intended for people who already know the language and are feature.replace(old_and_busted, new_hotness) narratives. Considering most new devs are going to be first exposed to JS and ES6/ES2015 and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to learn something then re/un-learn it, are there any books or other resources that teach it from the beginning?",1436893339

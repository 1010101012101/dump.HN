6046782,comment,6045083,6045414,5,0,cwzwarich,,,"> So when sending a message to an object multiple times you only pay for the cache lookup - which is pretty fast by itself and a cached call is faster than a C++ virtual method call.<p>This is not true. The code in Mike&#x27;s test for &quot;IMP-cached message send&quot; doesn&#x27;t match the cached path of objc_msgSend. It matches what you would get by doing IMP-caching yourself, which is common in some Objective-C frameworks, especially older ones. The cached path of objc_msgSend is what is measured by the &quot;Objective-C message send&quot; row, which is a lot slower.<p>The fast path of objc_msgSend roughly goes like this: you dereference the isa of the object to get to a class description, then you dereference a pointer to the cache, and after finding the selector in the cache, perform a tail indirect call to the IMP. Even if the cache lookup is free this is two dependent pointer dereferences followed by a dependent indirect branch.<p>A C++ virtual call just dereferences a vptr and makes an indirect call to a function at a static index in the vtable, which will always be more efficient than objc_msgSend. It&#x27;s true that manually caching the IMP yourself and calling it will be faster than a C++ virtual call, but there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from caching the implementation of a C++ virtual call in exactly the same way.<p>Another major factor in the performance difference between C++ and Objective-C is that C++ allows you to have non-virtual member functions, which can be inlined, whereas Objective-C requires all method calls to go through the same mechanism.",1373907196

It seems like women act more passive around men (at least in engineering).  If there are only women in an audience, they might be encouraged to speak their mind more and feel less awkward about it.<p>Here is an example of women being passive in engineering: 
An engineering club at my college had 30% to 50% women at almost every meeting.  Most of the time, the women didn&#x27;t do anything for the club&#x27;s project - they stood nearby, talked, and sometimes cut foam or got something for a guy. This was in a machine shop.<p>If they had put themselves forward and tried to get involved, they would have learned a lot <i>and had more respect from the guys in the process </i>. As it is, I&#x27;m afraid their behavior only reinforced the stereotype of &quot;women engineering majors aren&#x27;t serious&quot; and left them with fewer practical skills than the guys.<p>---<p>I don&#x27;t know how effective having a women-only audience and speaker would be at reversing situations like this. If the talk was on &quot;be more assertive&quot; and &quot;here are the potential problems you might face&quot;, it might be helpful.  men-are-evil and similar lines are not.<p>In the example given, having women-only clubs might help more - <i>if</i> the focus is primarily on building things, learning new tools, or completing some major project. It would increase womens&#x27; confidence and their assertiveness, as well as giving them an opportunitity to learn stuff a lot of the guys in the regular engineering club already know - without feeling awkward/stupid/embarassed.<p>Regardless, though, any women-only group opens up the door to women who might be uncomfortable speaking out and asking questions otherwise.<p>Edit: fixing some italics :/",1373907012

  The use of placebos as comparison or control
  interventions in cancer treatment trials is rare. If a
  placebo is used by itself, it is because no standard
  treatment exists. In this case, a trial would compare the
  effects of a new treatment with the effects of a placebo.
  More often, however, placebos are given along with a
  standard treatment. For example, a trial might compare the
  effects of a standard treatment plus a new treatment with
  the effects of the same standard treatment plus a placebo.</code></pre>",1373906095

Not knowing how close you are with father and/or son, it might be premature to assume he&#x27;d be ideal for a programming job (or any other technical vocation). Though, regardless of where the son might be on the spectrum, his family has experienced how different he can be. It is safe to assume that father is concerned for his son&#x27;s well-being, and likely based on ample experiences.<p>I am mentioning this for two reasons. I would, first of all, identify and confirm the father&#x27;s underlying concern. Why will he sleep better at night if his son has a job? I would not be surprised if any financial worries are dwarfed by, for example, the fear of seeing his son alone and isolated.  The father might see the job as a possible solution mitigation to his real concern. Since not having a job is a problem, but a fixable problem -as opposed to Asperger&#x27;s(*)-  it might be the only solution he sees to help his son.<p>Not all those diagnosed with Asperger&#x27;s find a niche in technical work. One of my close friends became a photographer. He was diagnosed at an early age and has had a therapist helping him make sense of the world. Regardless, the main message is that photography is his thing, it is something he enjoys, can keep him busy and pays the bills. The fact that the photographer is exempt from several social rules and expectations surely benefits.<p>Though not immediately useful, perhaps it gives you some ideas.<p>All the best,

Because the different compilers are almost certainly not functionally identical, the various Bk should not be expected to be bitwise identical.

If there are any differences, you can manually inspect them to determine what the issue is and either issue a bug report to the appropriate compiler, change the source (GCC 4.8.1) to avoid undefined behavior, or notify people of the attack present in the compiler in question, depending on what you find.

The argument here is, basically: if it&#x27;s true that men and women are interchangeable as resources of labor, then the wage gap can be seen as an opportunity for arbitrage. Any capitalist would just hire women (because the information the market has is based on the assumption that a woman can provide the same work as a man for a lesser cost), market forces would bring women&#x27;s pay up, the wage gap would diminish until we reached an equilibrium.<p>The argument is far from perfect (it ignores social and cultural aspects), but it is pretty reasonable as a way to see that <i>if there is a difference in pay, there is a difference in aggregate output</i>. What are the causes of this difference in output is subject to another topic, one I can&#x27;t say I have an explanation or consolidated opinion.<p>About the ethics of it: there is nothing unethical about choosing who to hire based on cost, if the quality of the final product is the same (and if the contracted parties are not doing anything unethical themselves). Let&#x27;s remove the sex factor out of the equation... if a woman living in NY asks for $100k for some work, and another woman with &quot;comparable education and experience&quot; living in Poland asks for $30k, is it unethical to hire the Polish one?",1373904510

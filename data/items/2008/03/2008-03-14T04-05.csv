136560,comment,136067,136067,0,0,wallflower,,,"Congratulations on graduating. There is a lot of excellent advice on developing into a better programmer here.<p>Programming can be challenging and financially rewarding. And it can give you the money to do the things you really like to do (which is up to you). Expect burnout. It happens to most everyone.<p>If you are nervous interviewing, there is a fundamental behavioral-based interviewing technique that you should know. A professor's husband told me the secret (so many people do not know the secret to interviewing well [programming trivia/programming whiteboard stress tests aside]). Google ""STAR"" + interviewing. Or I can do a short essay. Take interviews to practice - even if you're not necessarily attracted to the particular company. Actual practice (even mock) desensitizes you so you can shine better. After your interview, mail a typed, hand-signed letter to your main contact - in it thank them and <i>this is key</i> tell them you will followup at such-and-such a date and time (imagine which candidate will stick out - the one who took the time or the one who could care less to put effort in <i>formally</i> conveying interest in landing the position). CollegeGrad.com is an excellent resource (and a has a book worth buying - the advice landed me my first job) because someone who was a hiring manager opened-the-kimono on what he expects (from cover letter to screening interviews to site visits to even salary negotiations).<p>Before you start your job, consider taking some time off. To pause before you start your career. Ideally, travel. Or do something you like. Once you start working, your longest vacation will probably be two weeks long. The hardest adjustment is from a collegiate environment to a professional one. With few exceptions, all of us you meet on your first day of work have much more work experience. Your ""first day"" may feel like its a big deal but to us grizzled workers - it's not. Therefore humility is important. Don't show off your knowledge. Ask questions about what people are doing. The more you talk, the more they'll realize what you don't know. But if you don't talk a lot and ask smart questions, they will assume you are smart. On the flip side, take the initiative if there is something that interests (or more likely bothers you about the way something is being done) - we get sometimes blind-eyed to the problematic parts of a project - fresh perspectives help. Just be diplomatic.<p>Mentoring. Find a mentor. Don't force it - you have to become friends first. Ideally someone who is 3-5 years older and ahead of you and at a position where you want to be in three years.<p>Where do you want to be in 1/5/10 years? I started out with a group of college grads who unlike me got out of their cube and took on initiative and have easily jumped 2 or even 3 levels (e.g. managing 60-70 people). I'm still a developer - I never really was interested in management but I need to emphasize that you need to be proactive if you want to move into management.<p>On a side note, once you leave college you may fall out touch rapidly with your friends, especially if geography is involved. Facebook helps but if you truly want to keep in touch with your friends - you should take the initiative - organize reunions (e.g. annual trips to New Orleans Jazz Fest). And (Facebook helps again), have a system to remember their birthdays (and call them).",1205468575

136554,comment,133430,133430,0,0,slakin,,,"Maybe I'm dumb. I don't understand why anyone would give up spit for such a small amount of money. That early and the money offered is so small. Forget about the % and the stock and all that. From the amounts I read about I could do contract design work for a couple months and earn that much. Yikes. I mean, even if one of, say, two founders took a 6 mo contract working somewhere, and slso pounded code late at night, and the other founder all day and night, the two could do it all. In fact, that's exactly what happened here. And it provided still other advantages. Nor do I see how you can make anything happen for such a small amount of money. You can't even buy some software tools, a fax machine, let alone a CPA to spit out one tax return or a single patent application. Even a phone line and broadband is >$100/mo. Takeout food and heat, that's all you're going to get. Who needs that kind of money? I say just work your asses off 24/7 like we did, then you're not wasting time begging people to listen to your idea, either. These days even with a demo their eyes just glaze over. Investors don't have a clue. Just make it work and start selling them. That's what we did.",1205467989
136553,story,,,7,14,tx,"Ask YC: Is Internet Slowing down?",,"Normally I dislike <i>""Ask YC""</i> posts but I am genuinely curious about this one, so I decided to ask:<p>Is it just me, or just central Texas, but I have a feeling that Internet is slowing down. I work on various connections, from 1Mbit/sec to 9Mbit/sec and I am starting to notice that most web sites are getting slower.<p>When I got my first broadband in 2000, most sites would load instantly or nearly instantly. These days <i>everything</i> (except maybe google.com) takes 3-5 seconds to show up, regardless of my connection speed. ""Flat"" download speeds, i.e those of large files', remain fast though.<p>Has anyone else noticed this? If so, how would you explain it? Generally slower networks because of increased loads (video, torrents) or ISPs silently  introducing delays, or web sites running out of servers?<p>What kind of ""cloud computing"" are we talking about if we're spending more and more time in front of <i>loading...</i> banners? Even gmail, from a God of Scaling, has slowed down for me and isn't getting any better.<p>Add to that increasing number of ads, heavy flash content, and browsers that quickly swallow hundreds of megabytes of RAM and routinely block UI thread, and user experience is slowly drifting downhill.<p>Again, is it just me?",1205467888
136552,comment,136381,136441,0,0,bokonist,,,"The real limits are economies of scale.  If more and more people leave big companies to do startups, big companies may be forced to raise their salaries.  Google might pay a smart hacker far more than the hacker would make on average in a startup, because Google can leverage the hacker's talents across its enormous user base.<p>Economies of scale are based on transaction costs versus measurement costs ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm</a> ).  Transaction costs have declined dramatically with improvements in IT infrastructure, but measurement costs have changed relatively little.  In fact, measurement costs in knowledge industries are very high.  Thus I expect startups will continue to become more popular.<p>It is true that specific technologies saturate.

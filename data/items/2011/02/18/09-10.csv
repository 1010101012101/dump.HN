This makes sure that there will be no protests, because ""who cares about laws that aren't enforced anyway?"".<p>On the other hand, police officers (and higher authorities) can use these to lock up people that they don't like, or didn't pay their bribes. It will also mark the accused a social stigma, even though everyone and their brother violates that law, but people arrested for it are ""criminals"": Very effective in locking someone out of positions of power.<p>This can concern copyright laws, traffic laws, tax laws, laws with respect to sexual conduct, and so on... they've all been used in this way.",1298023175

They've been doing everything they can to reduce tinkerers to consumers ever since the first Mac (with no retail boards, no expansion slots, and a dealer-only case opening tool).

As the time goes, more and more local regulation would be added, and you will need people doing full time tracking and enforcement of it. Eventually, enough neighborhoods will notice how much similar regulation they have, and agree to outsource that part to be managed by an independent body focused on the issue.

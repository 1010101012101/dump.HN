3565321,comment,3553068,3565079,1,0,wvoq,,,"I don't mean to distract with the examples of corn subsidies and malaria.  I don't think it's terribly difficult to find a plethora of examples in which a state's concern for rather trivial internal affairs dwarfs its concern with globally momentous affairs that happen not to affect its citizens.  The fact that the spread of malaria could be, but has not been, mitigated by relatively cheap counter-measures just goes to show.<p>I am not claiming that immigration is an unalloyed good, nor that there are no caveats to consider.  I am claiming that freedom of travel is a human right, and that this freedom is largely compossible with the flourishing of the new states into which immigrants move.  I just cannot locate any moral claim I have against people who want to move to the part of the world circumscribed by US borders, nor any moral obligation they would have to recognize one.  Where is the argument?  I can certainly understand that citizens in certain industries would prefer that immigrants with similar skill-sets not immigrate, but protection from competition is not a human right.",1328680724

As far as I can tell, TSX will allow sets of operations to be executed, then ""rolled back"" in case of conflicts.  This could greatly improve performance of Java code within synchronized blocks, for instance, or provide much faster hardware implementation of the software transaction memory model in Clojure.<p>I believe the biggest benefit of this will be making multi-threaded programming easier to get right, and get decent performance to boot.  And if these constructs are supported natively in languages and frameworks, everyone will benefit from having 4- 8- or 16- cores.",1328680711

Indeed, ""censorship"" is probably too <i>weak</i> a concept for the damage that SOPA would have caused to the internet, since it implies a selective redaction instead of the complete and indiscriminate excommunication of every blacklisted domain.  I wouldn't call it ""misinformation,"" but did people who knew better (so to speak) choose a ""loaded and inflammatory term""?

Our ridiculously low capital gains rate, for example.<p>To the point of the article, there is actually a deep-running theoretical difference between various realization schemes. This isn't just ""trying to tax Zuckerberg"" but rather figuring out how to properly compute ""income = net accession in wealth."" The theoretical amount subject to tax is: Gain = Net income + Delta(value of property). Theoretically, you could compute the latter term at any interval you like (every year, etc). As a general policy we compute the term at sale of property because it's the easiest time to do so (the valuation is fixed precisely by a market transaction). But for something like a publicly traded stock, that rationale carries much less weight. And the counter-veiling concern of ensuring that the amount does get fairly taxed (instead of being held on-to indefinitely) probably outweighs that rationale in this case.",1328680153

3565256,story,,,1,2,Killah911,"AskHN: Is there a way to defeat snail mail?",,"Background info: ---<p>I have been wanting to move away from snail mail correspondence. I do e-bills whenever I can, opt for electronic W2s etc. I detest snail mail, its a waste of paper, it makes things messy, and it takes up tons of actual space/time etc sorting thru and keeping records.<p>I also travel a lot, so often, I will return home to find a bunch of mail in my mailbox, which will likely take up precious time I could be spending on more pleasurable tasks such as hitting my head on the wall.  As ""every problem is an opportunity"", I figured out a solution.<p>At first, I wanted to have a wifi enabled mailbox with a built-in scanner, so the mailman would have to insert standard size envelopes into a slot which would then open that piece of mail and scan the letter, upload the document to the web and shred the paper version.  My lil way of fighting the ""mail"" establishment.  After some searching, I come to the conclusion that, I have neither the time, money or mechanical engineering expertise to build such a device.  (although. if you're a gifted mech-e and can build such a system, I'm all ears).  I did a little Google search of ""smart"" mailboxes, and the ""smartest"" solution I found was a How-To article on Life Hacker, which alerted you on your iphone when you mailbox at home was opened.  I still needed a better solution.   I keep getting dinged by insurance companies and all those evil snail mail sending entities because I don't go thru my paper mail every day (or week, or month for that fact), so I desperately need a solution.<p>Back on Earth, I seem to find a solution that's bound to work.  I asked someone to bring my mail in periodically, open them and scan them on a scanner which is in the kitchen in my absence.  I figured it shouldn't be too hard to find a relatively ""smart"", wi-fi enabled,  all-in-one printer which can directly upload to the web (e.x. to Google Docs or Shoeboxed).  I spend hours looking for the right device, and I finally get an HP 7510, which is supposed to support HP's new ""PrintApps"" concept and per their website, scanning directly to google docs from this printer should be a breeze.  Alas, upon getting the printer, I realize that the google docs application isn't really there in their ""App Market"".  All the available apps generated more useless paper artifacts which would only add to my mail clutter.<p>I just spent over an hour on the phone with HP, to see if they could tell me whether apps are for specific printer types or not.  Only problem is that their Customer Service/Tech Support is worse than the half assed device I ended up buying.<p>It all seems so stupid to me.  I mean, heck it's not rocket science. WiFi enabled devices such as this should at least be able to send scanned data to the web.  It's absolutely something HP can support, but I get the feeling that they're choosing not to.  If people are all about digital documents, they may be afraid that they'll loose printer customers.  So, they include these ""shitty""  print apps, whose main purpose seems to be to generate more useless paper.  I'm so frustrated that something like this doesn't always exist.  It's 2012 for cryin out loud, we should've been able to do this since the advent of wifi.  It seemed doxie go WiFi would be capable of handling the task.  But by now, I've had it up to my eyeballs.<p>Question(s):\n--------<p>Does anyone know how to hack the new HPs, so that I can put my own, more useful software on it, which lets it communicate with and upload directly to the cloud?  At this point I'm really frustrated, I could buy other scanners which also boast this technology, but I don't want to go thru hell to set it up.  Anyone work one of these HP Apps?  I would also deeply appreciate any advise you can give on how to tackle this situation.  Shouldn't something like this be already exist?",1328679497

It starts with the premise that some outrageous tax revenue level is necessary, and from that premise tries to analyze the fairness of the existing tax code.<p>There's one thing I would really like to understand.  I've been mulling this over for a couple of months, and I'm coming to the conclusion that a vote in favor of ANY tax is immoral.<p>If I cast a vote for a tax, I am voting in favor of taking money from someone else, with the force of gunpoint and the threat of prison.  How can that be moral?<p>Since coming to this conclusion, I have tried to find arguments, and they usually start with ""well, we need to have a tax, or no one will pay.""  (Romney even said that in one of the debates.)  But I can't find any proof to this statement, and I find lots of things that disprove it.<p>1) The United States was founded with a volunteer militia funded completely voluntarily.  (And at the time, citizens had to pay tax to the enemy of the revolution, England.)<p>2) Numerous organizations ranging from charities, to huge churches that have survived several millenniums, to a complete country (Vatican City) are funded voluntarily, and do that quite successfully.<p>3) Free people freely give to causes that they believe in.  And people believe in freedom.  It would not be a hard sell.<p>The whole argument that we have to get more from the rich (or more from anyone, for that matter) is standing on this shaky ground - that somehow it's moral for ""the majority"" to steal from others through a diffuse system of voting, representatives, laws and organizations like the IRS.  But it's you and me, stealing from other people, and using organizations like the IRS and the police force as our weapons.  And that can't be right.<p>Honest question:  Can someone convince me that it's not immoral to vote for a tax?   Please don't down-vote me for asking a question, because I am honestly trying to understand.  If you disagree, help persuade me.<p>Edit:  I WANT to pay for freedom. I DON'T want to FORCE someone else to pay for freedom (which has an obvious contradiction).",1328679409

What's the U.S. tax rate at that level, currently?  15%?<p>So I envision your annual taxes, in your example, as looking something like:<p><pre><code>  Year  1     Earn $100k   Rate 10%   Tax  $10k\n  Year  2     Earn $100k   Rate 10%   Tax  $10k\n  Year  3     Earn $100k   Rate 10%   Tax  $10k\n  Year  4     Earn $100k   Rate 15%   Tax  $15k\n  Year  5     Earn $100k   Rate 15%   Tax  $15k\n  Year  6     Earn  $10k   Rate 15%   Tax $1.5k\n  Year  7     Earn  $10k   Rate 15%   Tax $1.5k\n  Year  8     Earn  $10k   Rate 15%   Tax $1.5k\n  Year  9     Earn  $10k   Rate 15%   Tax $1.5k\n  Year 10     Earn  $10k   Rate 15%   Tax $1.5k\n</code></pre>\nYou won't move into the 25% band until you've earned something like $1.3m over your life.",1328678694

So I have to pay more tax that I'm earning for those later 5 years.\nLets hope I saved a bunch during the first 5.<p>Conversely, my brother is a ski bum and has not earned over $10k a year for the last 10 years. He's actually an Aerospace Engineer, so lets say he now goes and gets a big-wig job for $200k a year for just 3 years. During those three years, he'll only pay tax on an (average) income of $53k, even though he had $200k coming in those 3 years.<p>It's certainly more appealing to not go to work until the last few years and earn as much as you possibly can in those years... somewhat like the opposite of retirement I imagine.",1328677223

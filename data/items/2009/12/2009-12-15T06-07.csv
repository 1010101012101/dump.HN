It's not even a single action, I don't play games that often anymore and the lack of an R18+ classification has almost no effect on me, there are many data points in Australian political actions though which reflect a deeply troubling underlying truth, the government perceives it's citizens as children.<p>My reasons for leaving are many, but the two big ones; primarily the above, but secondarily that I can't help thinking in a large amount of cases with regards to aforementioned citizens, the government is not entirely wrong.<p>So long Australia, and thanks for all the fish.",1260860282

If all of your data is accessible behind the same admin login, or if it is all vulnerable to the corruption in the original, then it still has only 1 point of failure.

If someone with full admin control to your system can destroy all of your data then you do not have backups. A proper backup is physically separate from your primary data and, preferably, can't be destroyed with mere admin access to the system.

You can do that transparently with BCrypt, migrating users as they log in. Every tiny incremental increase to the cost of a single login you make creates drastic cost increases for your attackers.

I feel that games are steering more and more away from photorealism towards more artistic direction. Same way that painters realized that creating photorealistic picture wasn't the point when painting, game developers will realize the power of nonrealistic graphics. That doesn't mean that future engines wouldn't continue to advance technically, but rather that engines will allow artists/designers to express themselves more easily and freely.<p>But who will be the Picasso of game development, that shall be seen.

It's with parents who may be incapable of (or unwilling to) teaching their kids anything (and therefor raise kids who are also incapable of teaching) or parents who will teach nothing but creationism/scientology or whatever.
Or parents who would decide on some career they want their kids to follow and try and teach them everything around that without long term consideration. Plenty of parents would rather their kids be good at sports than math for example.<p>I would be concerned that we would see something of a return to a caste system since what parents would be most qualified to teach would be what they themselves do.<p>Environment is also important for teaching, some of the environments in low income parts of the UK would be environments unsuitable for learning. Loud noises, drug/alcohol abuse, domestic violence etc.<p>At least having a school gives kids somewhere they can go and at least have some chance of learning.",1364093947

5430877,comment,5427985,5430553,3,0,derefr,,,"I should say, I didn't realize Bitcoin even <i>has</i> a ""manifesto."" The only things I know about Bitcoin come from studying it as part of my job: I'm developing an MMO, so I'm interested in the economics of virtual currencies. MMOs by-and-large have fiat, <i>non-scarce</i> virtual currencies (money just gets ""spawned"" from the aether in response to certain things, with no matching debt on any balance sheet) which is a bit of a mess. Bitcoin is a scarce (eventually-fixed) ""natural resource"" virtual currency, which provides interesting contrasts.<p>Now, anyway:<p>I think we fundamentally <i>agree</i> here--we're just using different words. You're saying you put money in a bank to ""secure"" it--secure it from what? <i>Losing value.</i> Cash under your mattress loses value from inflation. Stocks lose value from investors losing confidence in them. Your wallet loses value when you get mugged and the dollars are taken out of it. (An encrypted digital wallet is <i>somewhat</i> resistant to this.)<p>And how do banks secure you from loss, compared to all those other things? Besides being big thick concrete buildings with guards, they <i>mainly</i> lend your money out to other ""safe bets"" to earn ""enough"" interest to offset your inflationary losses. Note, I didn't say they put you <i>in the black</i>; they just <i>offset</i> your loss compared to what it would be under your mattress, while not notably increasing your risk.<p>During the 2007 banking crisis, people were buying US treasury bills that offered <i>negative interest</i>. Why? Because a small <i>known</i> loss was considered to be less risky than the <i>possible</i> loss from anything the rest of the market was offering. People using Japanese banks are currently operating under the same principle: they would rather put their money in the place it will lose the <i>least</i> value.<p>Another way to say this is: savings investment is a minimax algorithm (""minimize maximum loss."") In a thriving economy, you can minimize maximum loss with a positive net return. In a bad economy, it will sometimes require a negative net return. Either way, integrating over the probability distribution will put you in a future where you end up with the most money, compared to all your other selves who made riskier bets with higher returns, or less risky bets with lower returns.<p>Now, in turn, the whole economic theory on the necessity of inflation is that it moves the minimax risk-optimum for perfectly-rational actors from ""hoard"" to ""invest in very slightly risky ventures""; and the whole reason deflation is so scary is that it moves the minimax risk-optimum for perfectly-rational actors from ""invest even when it's a sure thing"" to ""sit on it and let it appreciate.""<p>Now, of course, humans on average aren't <i>anywhere near</i> ""perfectly rational""--and in some cases we may create artificial situations where the risk-optimum is shifted this way or that. For example, corporations seek short-term (usually single-quarter) gains, to encourage stock growth. Short-term gains are more found in risky investments than stable ones; and being paid in bonuses rather than equity encourages ""smart-looking-for-now"" behavior that will let one earn their bonus and cash out, even as the company hits the risk head-on and sinks.<p>> People play a large role, you can print infinite money but if people are afraid to spend it, you still won't experience inflation.<p>Blah blah Keynes blah government stimulus blah blah. Not getting into that. :)<p>> Under your assumption we shouldn't worry about price volatility, except we experienced worse shocks while under the gold standard than without it.<p>No, quite the opposite--""much worse price volatility"" is exactly the sort of thing I meant by ""a global Bitcoin economy would be strange."" No monetary policy means no quantitative easing, which is specifically deployed to decrease volatility.<p>Inflation and deflation, of course, would still occur--""money"" is nothing more than the value of an liability on a balance sheet, measured in the unit of a particular currency; as we leverage the money we have as investments into other things, the economy has more IOUs and therefore more money, whether more physical currency is getting printed/minted or not. And when things get de-leveraged, that money goes away.<p>The thing that makes Bitcoin interesting is simply that, as a ""natural resource"" currency, the ""base supply"" of unleveraged money can't grow to meet demand. If everyone wanted to withdraw their leveraged BTC-united wealth at the same time into ""actual Bitcoins"", they simply wouldn't be able to.<p>If we still operated mostly with physical currency, this would indeed be similar to the horrors of the Gold-standard era, where if a country 'ran out of money', it couldn't just write down a deficit--it literally would have no tokens of currency to send abroad to receive goods in trade, and its people would starve simply for want of some gold in a drawer in a bank somewhere.<p>As far as I can tell, Bitcoin proponents just counter this by saying that we <i>don't</i> operate mostly in physical currency--so we could indeed transfer a trillion BTC to Cyprus, or so forth, even though a trillion BTC don't ""exist."" It would simply be a new asset on our balance sheet, and a new liability on theirs. The only thing that would change is that the unit was BTC instead of USD.<p>---<p>Still, that's a bit silly. Every day, we have more people using more USD for more things (this is what a growing GDP means, basically.) Having a fixed supply of USD, even as we have a growing number of people wanting to use it as a token of trade, would be very annoying. There's nothing that would make BTC different in that regard. (The proponents will say that ""well, you can <i>subdivide</i> BTC to eight decimal places""--but even then, if I have an IOU saying ""1 trillion BTC"", <i>subdividing</i> physical BTCs won't get me any closer to being able to ""instantiate"" that trillion BTC in the real world. And if I can't do that, I can't take the BTC IOU your government sent my government and actually <i>spend</i> it on anything. So we're back to the starving-for-want-of-gold-in-a-drawer problem.)<p>If you can't tell, I don't actually think running the global economy in BTC is a particularly <i>good idea</i>. In fact, I don't think using Bitcoin <i>as</i> a currency is a particularly good idea. Bitcoin's ideal place in the economy, in my view, would be as a permanent, synthetic ""commodity"" to be traded on the commodities market--basically, a replacement for what people <i>currently</i> use gold for, but with an absolutely fixed supply.<p>In that role, Bitcoin-the-traded-commodity would still be able to serve its current function--basically, something you turn money in one currency into, to give to someone else in complete anonymity, who then turns the BTC back into money in their preferred currency. (You can also do this with gold, obviously. Bitcoin, then, is just ""a strange precious metal that weighs next to nothing, takes up next to no space, and is easy to send to someone by typing it into a computer through a keyboard."")<p>But commodity-traded Bitcoin could <i>also</i> serve as a good <i>unit</i> to normalize prices against, rather than just measuring them in USD as we do now. You could value currencies in BTC, value stocks, value stock <i>markets</i>--even value products at the supermarket. It would basically be a global version of the Brazilian Real concept--setting prices stable with respect to the inflation or deflation of any given currency. (The store shelf would say ""3.00 BTC"", and then they'd have a ""current exchange rate of BTC to USD"" posted--or it'd all be figured out by our ubiquitous smartphone gizmos. Admittedly, going this far is a bit of a hassle if your country <i>isn't</i> experiencing hyperinflation, but it <i>does</i> work everywhere, and that feels sort of elegant to me in the same way a nice, concise algorithm does.)<p>This ""absolute measure"" could also make people take notice of the competitive devaluation spiral that the USD and the RMB have gotten into recently. :)<p>I might try this in my MMO, actually. Set up a fiat ""fixed-supply"" commodity and then normalize prices in units of it, even though you're paying for things with non-fixed-supply currencies.",1364093475

These services would then send you a specifically formatted email for each new post.<p>The title could be the subject, the post as the message.  Perhaps the Blog, date and post link would be the first line.  Extra information could be set in ""X-"" headers or in a signature.  We'd need a standardized method for formatting these emails so that RSS readers could plug and play.<p>Finally you'd need to set up some filtering to avoid spamming yourself, or use a separate email address altogether.<p><i>Reading</i><p>Ok so maybe that would decentralize the storage of the posts.  And you'd get some niceties like searching built in with your email provider.  At first I assumed a read email would equal a read feed, which could work.  But this would require readers to be able to access your email to mark them read.<p>Another thought would be for the RSS readers to support a forwarding address.

5430767,comment,5430216,5430619,12,0,anywhichway,,,"Yes.  The math is much more subtle than people realize.  Bayesian (meaning conditional) probability is required for any solution to be passable.  The problem that needs to be solved is given the number of upvotes, downvotes, and views, what is the probability that it is a comment that the next random reader would want to upvote it, and then sort on that probability.  There are well established formulas for this kind of thing.<p>The one you link considers the upvotes and downvotes as the sample population then constructs the probability that you will upvote it and ranks on that.  This allows late posts to take over early posts if they have a better ratio, even if they have significantly less votes,  but only if it is ""enough"" better to make up for its lack of confidence.<p>This fails to address a few things here:<p>* It completely ignores people that read the post but didn't vote.  There really is no way to get a perfect count of this no matter how much scroll logging, but you could approximate it and then include it in the calculation.<p>* On HN many people can't downvote.<p>* As others have pointed HN doesn't necessarily start with a base assumption of all commenters being equal, nor should they.",1364091108

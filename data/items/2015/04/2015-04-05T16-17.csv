My employer paid my salary for the duration.  If it had not, I would have been excused for &quot;financial hardship.&quot;<p>One of the most frustrating aspects of the grand jury process is that the ADAs instruct you on the elements of the law after you&#x27;ve heard the evidence, and tend to do so poorly.  By the time they&#x27;ve even told you that they&#x27;re charging trafficking, and what that means specifically, it&#x27;s often inconvenient to bring someone back to testify as to gross vs. net weight, that sort of thing.  For one charge, the ADA read aloud a very long paragraph from the statue, of which only one sentence was relevant.<p>I also found that some jurors leaned heavily on &quot;probable cause&quot; as an excuse to be sloppy.  The bar is lower, it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re convicting the guy, and besides, do you think the cops didn&#x27;t do their job?<p>That said, most of the cases were strong.  There was little doubt that the accused performed the action.  Most of the doubt was whether the action satisfied the elements of the crime.  Out of hundreds of charges, we only returned a &quot;no bill&quot; (declined to indict) on one.  However, I strongly believe that we incorrectly returned a &quot;true bill&quot; (voted to indict) on two charges.<p>The experience was educational, but not one I&#x27;d wish to repeat.  Most of my co-jurors look back on it much more negatively than I do.<p>Edit: I should add that the ADA was very unhappy with the one &quot;no bill&quot; that we returned, incredulous that we could come to the conclusion that we did.",1428252951

Not to say anything about the &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; which I certainly have because I never followed a structured path on the subject.<p>First of all, the unknown unknowns are much worse from the kid who went to school. Wanna know why? Because the autodidact is definitely better equipped to repair a gap. Its ridiculous to think a 4 year degree can teach a gapless understanding of computers-- do you really expect a 22 year old to have a gapless understanding of any field?<p>The most important thing a CS degree can teach someone is how to learn more, and at least in my experience it dramatically falls short. Never encouraged to read source. Never encouraged to implement an assignment in another language. The message to me and my peers is clear: learn java and go work for Epic or another dead-end enterprise place.<p>Last semester I did a hackathon and some of the competitors were 4 kids that clearly did nothing outside of class. My group implemented a mobile app and responsive website. We learned NONE of that in any class. They implemented a GUI desktop application in java with eclipse. (It astounds me how many people can come out of my CS program and the only way they know how to compile their projects is via a green button.)<p>Second of all: your lack of knowledge about low level stuff is entirely on you. You can learn that anywhere. The problem is that 20 year olds, whether they&#x27;re in uni or not, think that the high level world of rails and Python is more interesting than bits and bytes. I have never formally learned about the specifics of any of the *nix kernels, Unix tools, python arthimetic, C macros, and more.

If common-law defenses or other considerations are not included in the plain text of codified laws, the codified laws need to be fixed.<p>- Adversarial system vs inquisitional system.  These need not be disjoint.  Some sort of hybrid where the judge (and jury) can ask pointed questions of witnesses, or ask for elaboration on some point a lawyer is making, seems prudent. That&#x27;s not to say the adversarial system is entirely bad.  The notion, at least in civil cases, and for the defense in criminal cases, that the parties need their own dedicated advocate, is certainly valuable.<p>- Too many laws. The externalities of creating more and more laws seem lost on legislators (figuratively speaking; not truly lost, but ignored, since it ensures job security for lawyers).<p>- Reform of the <i>incentives</i> for prosecutors. The objective should not be to win cases, but to serve the public interest.  Criminal prosecutions should not really have dedicated advocates intent on trying to convict the defendant, but that&#x27;s what prosecutors in the United States usually are.

The aforementioned gerrymandering strongly encourages vehement and almost parade-like, but ultimately empty and financially wasteful political campaigns, along with focusing one&#x27;s efforts on leaving an impression only in certain key states and districts that are really decisive to one&#x27;s performance.<p>Yet even people who are well versed in statistics and probability often seem to grant an exception for the insanity of voting in the United States, out of a perverse democratic ideal that ultimately isn&#x27;t really there.

Plus the extras you learn from the professor in class, or after class, or during office hours, or hanging around with other students.<p>While theoretically an autodidact can study the same as a college student, they generally skip over pushdown automata and Gödel numbers and L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule and go right to learning things such as Ruby and its methods, without any theory.  Some progress can be made initially, but the lack of a base of theory usually causes problems at some point.<p>You can get into a good local public school like Berkeley or UIUC or Georgia Tech for a decent price.  You can apply for Pell grants, work/study and so forth.<p>During go-go times, you can often get work without a degree.  During downturns like 2001 or 2008, suddenly everyone is laying people off, and the market is flooded with job applicants, many with college degrees.  This is when you really need a college degree, especially if you have a family.  You don&#x27;t want then to be the time to realize you need a bachelors.   Even if you get work again, you&#x27;ll be juggling a full-time job, wife, kids, in-laws, plus your night/weekend classes and studying, in addition to whatever else you&#x27;re doing.",1428250324

Many people end up in college not because it is a good fit but because it&#x27;s the default thing to do, because people assume you&#x27;re a complete failure if you don&#x27;t and because it&#x27;s artificially required to have most good jobs. The number of openings that require a college degree—but don&#x27;t care which one—makes this abundantly clear: businesses are using it as a signal that&#x27;s entirely independent of <i>what</i> you learned.<p>I&#x27;ve always been curious, and a little disturbed, at how inflexible a college education is for something supposedly universal. People are different and need different things from their education, but everyone gets the same sort of classes at the same sorts of medium-to-large institutions. If you want something less oriented around classes or smaller and more personal or more specialized or more hands on or not forced into digestible quarter- or semester-sized chunks, you&#x27;re completely out of luck.<p>But if this doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s apparently a problem <i>with you</i>, not with the system.<p>And then, of course, we turn around and feign surprise when college prices go up as we artificially drive demand through the roof.<p>I personally valued the college experience I&#x27;ve had so far... with the exception of most of my classes. What really worked for me was doing research, taking graduate courses, learning on my own, interacting with other students and a bunch of external things like working part-time at a startup. But there&#x27;s simply no other way to get into research, even though many seem to agree that the overlap between strong study skills and research potential is, at best, limited.<p>I&#x27;d like to be doing research now and, false modesty aside, would be entirely capable, but it&#x27;s very difficult outside the inflexible system. It really doesn&#x27;t need to be.<p>In hindsight, I would have loved an alternative. But, as far as I know, that alternative does not exist and, if it did, I would not have known about it in high school. The only other choice would have been going to a small liberal arts college, which has more classes and less of everything I actually liked.<p>The pressure to go to college is too high.

9324382,comment,9323898,9323898,0,0,jfasi,,,"Thiel makes some interesting points, and I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with the substance of what he&#x27;s saying. However, I&#x27;d like to offer a reframing of the college debate that goes beyond the views put forward by Thiel et al. with regards to higher education. I&#x27;d like to break offer two points regarding higher education.<p><i>Firstly</i>, Thiel argues that society suffers when high-caliber people go through elite colleges and take positions at conservative organizations in old industries. He implies that society would be better served if more of these people went off to do startups or other cutting-edge organizations.<p>My rebuttal to this is: lots of elite college-trained people are going to startups. There is no system barrier between highly-trained (if somewhat conservatively thinking) people and cutting edge stuff. In fact, some of the most elite MBA programs are taking note of the interest among their students and creating programming specifically to help them enter that realm [1].<p>Also, what&#x27;s wrong with highly trained people going into management consulting and investment banking? If talent gravitates toward these industries, it&#x27;s not because peoples&#x27; training made them useless for any other purpose, but rather because of standard economics: people have a right to want to get paid.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;d argue that Thiel is mistakenly conflating lack of sexiness with social damage. General Motors and JP Morgan are not startups, and few starry-eyed undergrads would dream of a mid-tier leadership role in such an organization over founding their own billion dollar company. But what&#x27;s wrong with having competent and well-trained leaders in charge of these companies? They might not show up on the covers of popular entrepreneurship magazines, and they might not be the first do something sexy and innovative, but these sorts of companies do deliver a tremendous amount of growth and innovation to the economy. GM&#x27;s size and distribution clout makes it as viable and worthy a source of innovation as, say, Tesla, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with training people to lead those productive if boring machines.<p><i>Secondly</i>, on the topic of Obama&#x27;s push for more higher education, I believe Thiel brings to the argument a Silicon Valley/disruptive innovation-centered view on what is actually a different problem. Thiel argues that talent is best allocated to new industries because they are the ones that produce &quot;black-swan&quot; type economic innovations. This may be true, but I think it fails to discuss a more systemic issue.<p>As few as fifteen years ago, American manufacturing represented a significantly larger portion of the economy, with a hiring demand to match [1]. As recently as two or three decades ago, a high school-educated person could live comfortably and securely on a manufacturing salary. Our economy is currently dealing with a decline of well-paying work for relatively low-skilled labor. We&#x27;re transitioning from a work-based economy to a service economy where intellectual skills are most valuable.<p>The economic study establishment sees this. Obama sees this. Cast in this light, the spike in college tuitions is not the irrational bubble that Thiel attempts to portray, but rather a natural and unavoidable consequence of millions of people suddenly realizing that their futures depend on skills that until now only private colleges have been able to give them. Economically, subsidizing higher education is a natural response. Culturally, placing higher value on higher-tier educations is a natural consequence given the fact that simply having a degree is no longer by itself a marker of intellectual exceptionality. Hence the spike in demand for prestige.<p>The only way this country is going to transmute the legacy of its fantastic economic power from the twentieth century into correspondingly fantastic economic power in the twenty-first century is by successfully making a transition to a knowledge economy. People know this, and they&#x27;re reacting en mass. Money is being poured by the bucketload into higher education. Radical experiments are taking place in education technology. Traditional institutions are rethinking themselves. This change is already in progress, and it&#x27;s clear the solution is more focus on education rather than less.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/01/03/business-school-startups-entrepreneurs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortune.com/2015/01/03/business-school-startups-entre...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.usitc.gov/research_and_analysis/documents/Pierce%20and%20Schott%20-%20The%20Surprisingly%20Swift%20Decline%20of%20U.S.%20Manufacturing%20Employment_0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usitc.gov/research_and_analysis/documents/Pierce%...</a>",1428249616

That's because the data are not from a random sample of the relevant population. One professor of statistics, who is a co-author of a highly regarded AP statistics textbook, has tried to popularize the phrase that ""voluntary response data are worthless"" to go along with the phrase ""correlation does not imply causation."" Other statistics teachers are gradually picking up this phrase.<p>-----Original Message----- From: Paul Velleman [SMTPfv2@cornell.edu] Sent: Wednesday, January 14, 1998 5:10 PM To: apstat-l@etc.bc.ca; Kim Robinson Cc: mmbalach@mtu.edu Subject: Re: qualtiative study<p>Sorry Kim, but it just aint so. Voluntary response data are worthless. One excellent example is the books by Shere Hite. She collected many responses from biased lists with voluntary response and drew conclusions that are roundly contradicted by all responsible studies. She claimed to be doing only qualitative work, but what she got was just plain garbage. Another famous example is the Literary Digest ""poll"". All you learn from voluntary response is what is said by those who choose to respond. Unless the respondents are a substantially large fraction of the population, they are very likely to be a biased -- possibly a very biased -- subset. Anecdotes tell you nothing at all about the state of the world. They can't be ""used only as a description"" because they describe nothing but themselves.<p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tstart=36420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tsta...</a><p>For more on the distinction between statistics and mathematics, see<p><a href=""http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p>and<p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>I think Professor Velleman promotes ""Voluntary response data are worthless"" as a slogan for the same reason an earlier generation of statisticians taught their students the slogan ""correlation does not imply causation."" That's because common human cognitive errors run strongly in one direction on each issue, so the slogan has take the cognitive error head-on. Of course, a distinct pattern in voluntary responses tells us SOMETHING (maybe about what kind of people come forward to respond), just as a correlation tells us SOMETHING (maybe about a lurking variable correlated with both things we observe), but it doesn't tell us enough to warrant a firm conclusion about facts of the world. The Literary Digest poll<p><a href=""http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/</a><p><a href=""http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf</a><p>is a spectacular historical example of a voluntary response poll with a HUGE sample size and high response rate that didn't give a correct picture of reality at all.<p>When I have brought up this issue before, some other HNers have replied that there are some statistical tools for correcting for response-bias effects, IF one can obtain a simple random sample of the population of interest and evaluate what kinds of people respond. But we can't do that here on HN.<p>Another reply I frequently see when I bring up this issue is that the public relies on voluntary response data all the time to make conclusions about reality. To that I refer careful readers to what Professor Velleman is quoted as saying above (the general public often believes statements that are baloney) and to what Google's director of research, Peter Norvig, says about research conducted with better data,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>that even good data (and Norvig would not generally characterize voluntary response data as good data) can lead to wrong conclusions if there isn't careful thinking behind a study design. Again, human beings have strong predilections to believe certain kinds of wrong data and wrong conclusions. We are not neutral evaluators of data and conclusions, but have predispositions (cognitive illusions) that lead to making mistakes without careful training and thought.<p>Another frequently seen reply is that sometimes a ""convenience sample"" (this is a common term among statisticians for a sample that can't be counted on to be a random sample) of a population offers just that, convenience, and should not be rejected on that basis alone. But the most thoughtful version of that frequent reply I recently saw did correctly point out that if we know from the get-go that the sample was not done statistically correctly, then even if we are confident (enough) that HN participants are young, we wouldn't want to extrapolate from that to conclude that the users of any technology site are young, or that users of the Internet as a whole are young.<p>On my part, I wildly guess that most HNers are younger than I am in part because this kind of poll recurs often on HN. Other preoccupations of younger rather than older people make up frequent topics on HN, and I've tried looking for signs that there are large hidden numbers of old participants here without finding many.<p>P.S. Can you tell whether or not I responded to the poll question any of the times I commented on this issue?",1300106883

2322235,comment,2321838,2321838,0,0,kamme,,,"As an Ubuntu user since day one I don't like the way the distro is going. As some other users said before, the UI is not that great and lately I've seen ridiculous 'fixes' for bad decisions. For example: <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/notify-osd/+bug/468754"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/notify-osd/+bug/46...</a><p>This is seen as a feature, it's basically a top right growl style notification bubble, but they added an 100px top offset so it wouldn't interfere with other applications. Why? Because the user can not click the notifications away, they have a delay and waiting is the only way to remove those bubbles. This has to be one of the worst decisions ever. Look at growl/OSX, it works. In this case it's fine to copy a feature and not try to be different.<p>Another thing I absolutely don't understand is all the media/audio frameworks there have been since 4.10 (not really an Ubuntu only problem), why not stick with one that just works? IMHO, Ubuntu should experiment all they want with unity, notify-osd, placing window buttons to the left, ... but please, just provide a basic install option that just works without all the fancy new stuff (that is probably thrown out soon anyway because something else comes up).<p>Just make it work. Steve Jobs seems to be able to impose decisions on a large group of people, but he also seems to have thought about most things really really well. Lately Ubuntu seems to adopt everything as long as it doesn't look like something everybody else has.<p>Sorry if I'm ranting, but as an Ubuntu lover the last few years have been a serious disappointment.",1300106818

This means that if I'm in a setting where I don't want to make noise (e.g. in a library, in a meeting, in a class) and boot up, there's absolutely no way for me to prevent my laptop from playing the wonderful startup .wav file. I have to log in before I get any sort of volume control. (My laptop doesn't have a hardware volume dial.) Granted, at this point I have it disabled, but it'd still be nice to have.<p>2.) When I've booted up, the first thing I do is open all the programs I'm planning to use on different desktops. (I <i>love</i> multiple desktops.) The trouble for me is, the windows all open on whatever desktop I happen to be looking at at the moment. I would greatly prefer that they open on the desktop I was looking at when I started them. That would let me start at desktop 1, open Firefox/Chromium, switch to 2, open an IDE, switch to 3, open Gimp, switch back to 1 and start web surfing. Instead I have to wait for the program to finish initializing before moving to the next step to ensure that it's on the right desktop.

The value of a product isn't just a product, but with respect to a user. It's not just the observed, but also the observer. You cannot evaluate it as a tuple of its qualities (particular features, price etc). You have to weigh each quality by the user's valuation it.
And different users value them differently.
It's seeming to me more and more that this summarises the entire startup problem.<p>As a developer, you have a clear idea of what features you want to add, how difficult they will be, how general they will be, and how cool they will be. You're not even evaluating it <i>as a user</i>, but as a creator. It's the difference between a novel that was interesting to write, and one that's interesting to read.<p>But even if you do manage to shift your perspective to being a user, you'll still only have <i>one</i> user's perspective. In fact, there isn't ""a user"", but a whole world of different situations, tasks, skills, equipment, knowledge and values - each of which counts as ""a user"", who will evaluate the qualities of the product different. e.g. for some users, a higher price makes it more valuable.<p>This is an incredibly obvious point, but it's one that I have to be constantly reminded of. Perhaps because the more deeply immersed I am in my work, the less evidence I have of other viewpoints (I can't <i>see</i> them, <i>at best</i> they're imaginary) so it's easy to not think about them. Or maybe I'm just excessively egocentric and solipsistic.<p><i>Different strokes for different folks. What might be right for you might not be right for someone else.</i><p>One solution is to imagine your ideal user (who'd love what you want to make anyway - whether they exist or not), and keep evaluating your product in terms of that person - including marketing. Users who are <i>similar</i> to that person will tend to fit themselves into the image. Guy Kawasaki (early Apple guy) talks about this.

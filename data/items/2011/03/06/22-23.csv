They'd do this anywhere they'd want -- living together in a house/apartment, working from coffee shops, etc. They'd have access to Google's resources if/when they'd need them (kind of like how YC now has significant resources to help out its companies -- e.g. TechCrunch for initial distribution), but would not be required to use them.<p>The ultimate metric for a web property is getting repeat users at scale, so that's the #1 goal.<p>But as you say, Google doesn't really suffer from this problem at least initially (they can always get a substantial amount of immediate users for any new product).<p>The problem is, are they products people want?

Vastly more men die in the line of work than women do, across many fields, for example. More men than women were pioneers by a couple orders of magnitude. More men choose the military, police or fire department as their career than women by an order of magnitude. More men become astronauts, revolutionaries, and stock brokers.<p>It seems highly unlikely that these disparities are entirely systemic, or based entirely on our society's norms and expectations; though I'm willing to believe that some of the differences are based on environment rather than genetics, and I hope that if I have daughters they will be given ample opportunities to choose any path they want, including startups (in whatever field startups are interesting in 25-30 years).<p>My point is that it is silly to suggest that <i>just</i> encouraging girls to take a more active interest in math and sciences will not solve this gender disparity. And, it may even be impossible to ""solve"" it. Women may just not <i>want</i> to start companies at the same rate as men. If that's the case, there's nothing we can do to ""fix"" it. I quoted ""solve"" and ""fix"" because it assumes that there's something wrong with people who don't want to start companies. I don't know that that's the case. We might be the ones taking unnecessary risks for things that may not be as good for long-term health, happiness, and well-being.

Most of the Speed Reading demos out there focus on reading short paragraphs and that&#x27;s it. Even if comprehension is not a problem, how fast and how <i>feelings</i> develop in your brain as you read may not be comparable between traditional reading and speed reading.

Probably not: Texas derives around 58% [1] of its highway costs from vehicle-related fees (e.g. registration, gas tax, etc.) and the rest is subsidized from unrelated sources.<p>Then again if we did not have a road system, our economy would be in poor shape, because it is harder to get the store to buy things, and to transport the things around.  So from that perspective roads are an economic net positive even if they were 100% subsidized from unrelated businesses.<p>Gigabit internet is similar to roads.  It probably can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t be funded 100% by the people who use it. At the same time, it is important infrastructure that opens up new avenues for economic opportunity, and I suspect that any major city that had gigabit as available as roads or electricity would find that the benefits exceed the costs, be they subsidized or otherwise.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.icloud.com/iw/#numbers/BAKsWA7R5a0YQGg3ptGBpPlvQVOwHeYiVwiF/Texas_highway_funding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.icloud.com/iw/#numbers/BAKsWA7R5a0YQGg3ptGBpPlvQ...</a>",1394768805

The 30,000 number includes fatalities or injuries to people in cars as well. So a lot of relevant data is being left out.<p>Wikipedia has a link to NHTSA figures that give more detail. The link is here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year#cite_note-NHTSA10-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in...</a><p>From the 2010 data:<p>* 32,885 total fatalities<p>* 23,303 (70.8 percent) of those were vehicle occupants<p>* 4,502 (13.7 percent) were on motorcycles (drivers or passengers)<p>* 4,280 (13.0 percent) were pedestrians<p>* 618 (1.9 percent) were cyclists<p>* 182 (0.6 percent) were &quot;other/unknown non-occupants&quot;<p>So the article is focusing in on something that&#x27;s, at most, only 15 percent or so (counting pedestrians and cyclists, since the article talks about both) of the problem. I say &quot;at most&quot; because of other interesting statistics from the NHTSA report:<p>* 31 percent of fatalities were in incidents involving alcohol-impaired drivers.<p>* 47 percent of the crashes that resulted in pedestrian fatalities had alcohol use reported by either the driver or the pedestrian or both. Interestingly, 33 percent of the pedestrians involved in these crashes were alcohol impaired, but only 14 percent of the <i>drivers</i> involved were; in 6 percent of the crashes, <i>both</i> the driver and the pedestrian were alcohol impaired.<p>* 32 percent of fatalities were in incidents where the driver was speeding. (42 percent of the drivers who were speeding were alcohol-impaired.)<p>* 42 percent of motorcycle drivers, and 51 percent of motorcycle passengers, who were fatally injured were not wearing helmets.<p>* 51 percent of vehicle occupants killed were not restrained (not wearing seat belts, or not in child seats/restraints).<p>* 11 percent of fatalities involved large trucks (gross vehicle weight over 10,000 pounds); of those, 76 percent were occupants of other vehicles, 14 percent were occupants of the trucks, and 10 percent were pedestrians.<p>Taking all this into consideration, I see a very different picture from &quot;vehicles are murder machines&quot;. It looks to me like the major factors causing fatalities are individual choices made by people that put them at higher risk. And it&#x27;s not like those choices are difficult, or about things that most people don&#x27;t know. How hard is it to wear a seat belt? To put a helmet on if you&#x27;re on a motorcycle?

With drive you pay for allocated capacity, with S3 don&#x27;t you pay for actual usage? Depending on the level of overcommit, its possible for less expensive per GB &quot;capacity&quot; priced service to be profitable on top of a more expensive per GB &quot;usage&quot; priced service.<p>Normally I would agree, but the price gap is so large (close to 10x), you could easily downgrade to the next smallest capacity level in Google Drive. You would only actually lose money if you wanted to store more than 100 GB but less than 10/0.085 = 118 GB. That means for most overcommit levels, you&#x27;re still winning by a reasonable margin.<p>> Plus, its at least theoretically possible, especially if a lot of the stored content is not efficiently compressed on its own, that the consumer capacity-priced service could also use compression and/or deduplication to further reduce usage on the usage-priced backend.<p>Compression is unlikely to yield enough, but perhaps deduplication would save you. Still, 10x is big gap to make up for.<p>> > Google Drive is not programmatically accessible like S3.<p>> Google Drive most assuredly is programmatically accessible via an API.<p>Admittedly, I&#x27;m not too familiar with the Google Drive API, but my impression is that it is geared toward entirely different use cases (compared to S3-like storage services).

You&#x27;re incorrectly blurring these very different concepts.<p>I never claimed that all UIs back then were &quot;perfect&quot;, or that there weren&#x27;t &quot;badly designed&quot; UIs. I was very clearly talking about consistency between different applications running on the same system.<p>When using applications from that period of time, one could expect to find a menu bar and menus that were quite similar to those of other applications. Of course there were application-specific menus and items, but there was at least a common subset shared by nearly all applications, especially any that were designed with even the minimal level of care.<p>The same held true for toolbars, keyboard shortcuts, common dialogs, and so forth. There were also general conventions for how the application-specific parts of UIs looked and behaved. While not everyone followed these conventions, of course, most of the major and seriously-designed applications did.<p>We have lost much of that today. It&#x27;s particularly bad when it comes to mobile apps, and getting worse when it comes to desktop applications. Yes, Microsoft and Apple themselves are to blame, to some extent. But it goes much beyond that these days. Inconsistency is the norm, and that does lead to inefficiency.",1394766914

It&#x27;s very easy to walk around behind of or in front of the train while it&#x27;s still in the station or approaching the station. We&#x27;ve had incidents where individuals or groups of commuters who just got off the train try to cross the track behind the train, assuming that the gates are down because the train hadn&#x27;t left yet, only to be struck by a train arriving on the other track. There was a big public education campaign after the last incident like that, but the town had to resort to a police officer stationed there during rush hour handing out jay-walking tickets before people would stop trying to cross while the gates were down.<p>There&#x27;s also a strong suspicion that a lot of these deaths are suicides, but that&#x27;s pretty hard to prove.",1394766764

In most vehicles the tires are placed fairly close to the corners of the vehicle, which I assume increases stability and improves maneuverability.<p>But in school buses the tires are set far back from the corners, especially the rear tires. In a large bus the tires are 5-10 feet from the rear bumper. School buses also tend to have a very high ground clearance. I assume that these design features are for safety: if the bus hits a child while starting to move, either backward or forward, the driver will have a lot more time to react to the thud against the bumper before the tires reach the child. It takes a moment for the driver to notice the thud and move his foot from the gas to the brake; if the tires were at the corners that moment is all it would take for the bus to roll over the child.<p>So, I think this is an example where the vehicle is designed explicitly to protect pedestrians, even though it probably makes the vehicle less stable and harder to maneuver.",1394766174

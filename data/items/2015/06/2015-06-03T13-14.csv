9652535,comment,9651197,9652170,0,0,hollerith,,,">Everything internet sucked around 2000. Search engines where either semi-curated listing or covered a fraction of what was a much smaller internet.<p>I disagree, and in fact preferred the internet of 2000 to the internet of 2015.<p>Google search worked fine in 2000: although SEO existed in 2000, it was much less refined and extensive than in 2015. The main problem in search results today is that profit-motivated content crowds out and makes it difficult to find not-profit-motivated superior content.<p>Not all the changes are bad, of course. Video in particular (not just bandwidth, but the convenience for consumers and amateur producers provided by Youtube) is much better (but text is more important to me than video). A computer with adequate performance is a lot cheaper in real dollars.<p>>A lot of websites had terrible UX.<p>I preferred the UX of the web of 2000 to the UX of the web of today. Searching a web page for a string, copying from a web page, then pasting, scrolling, use of keyboard shortcuts, bookmarking (some sites today have all content sharing the same URL, making bookmarking virtually impossible) all were simpler and more consistent across web pages, therefore requiring less deliberative thought to use, and IMHO thereby better.<p>In other words, on the web of today, I have to direct my attention to the mechanics of the web page, e.g., how to dismiss the interstitial asking me to follow them on Facebook or whatever so that I can start to see the actual content, which keyboard shortcuts have been overridden by the site, how to scroll and whether scrolling even works. In the web of 2000, I spent more of my time and attention on the actual content (particularly, <i>textual</i> content).<p>For those who remember the web of 2000: what about the UX of the web of today do you prefer?  I have a theory that some people are more easily bored than others and that those people appreciate the web of today because the increase in variety, color and motion (of elements on the page) helps keep them from getting bored. Is that it?<p>(I remember the Sourceforge of 2000, but have nothing to say about it.)<p>ADDED. I neglected to consider that Wikipedia did not exist in 2000, which significantly changes the balance. I still disagree with &quot;Everything internet sucked around 2000&quot;. In particular, I miss web sites created by individuals not expecting to make money from their writings. Although many (most?) of those web sites still exist, they&#x27;ve become vastly harder to find with a search engine because of content farms and other professionally-produced professionally-SEOed content.",1433339854

Myself I grew up in Germany and lived in San Francisco for some time. My co-founder had a strong network in Barcelona through his previous job at Deloitte. Today we still get requests through our personal network, however, most of our new incoming work is simply referral based. We don&#x27;t even have a single sales person. So we try our best possible to do quality work, but also are actively involved with our clients and partners and help them improve their own businesses. This is not just an extra effort on our side, but also makes the whole &quot;work&quot; thing way more exciting and interesting for ourselves, rather than just being a sweatshop that churns out code.<p>We mostly work with startups, some of them as clients and some as partners. But we also have been recommended and introduced to some big corporations in various industries. And while we don&#x27;t like the bureaucratic hassle that comes with it, it does give us quite some stability. For example, a big medical company just switched to use as their main supplier for web development, which immediately gave us 30 new long-term projects.<p>Overall we always try to give a lot, be involved and pro-active and help where we can. In the end you always get something in return. This has been my personal philosophy since ever and always and we&#x27;ve also established this as one of the cornerstones in our company culture.",1433339734

Then you can work with your team or your client to scope out your milestone/offer and select which items to work on. The green switches on the left signals if an item should be done or not.<p>With that you can find the set of items which fit into the timeline and the customers budget.<p>With the next feature being integrated time tracking you can get a good overview of what items are completed vs. how much time/money is still left.<p>Did that answer your question?",1433338841

VC&#x27;s (even those VC&#x27;s not specializing in Silicon Valley tech) value makers, builders, engineers over experts in English/Art/History/Philosophy.  If liberal arts <i>education</i> was on equal footing as STEM, there wouldn&#x27;t be the jokes about that B.A. in English acting as an expensive way to train Starbucks baristas.  (Please notice I emphasize the &quot;education&quot; of liberal arts and not the pure value of liberal arts for its own sake when making comparisons.)<p>Unfortunately, the economic possibilities of tech droputs vs liberal arts graduates contributes to the (often smug) STEM circle-jerk.  The current trend of &quot;software is eating the world&quot; underlies the disparity.<p>If a 19-year old freshman compsci dropout from MIT, Stanford can work on a startup for 3 years and be regarded as higher value than the 22-year old compsci graduate, it means that MIT/Stanford&#x27;s primary value (to investors) is to act as an unspoken IQ test.  In other words, we care more that you were the top percentile of SAT scores and passed other intelligence filters more so than any particular curricula you would have completed at the end of 4 years.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating that what we say (lip service about college) does not match how people in power vote with their wallets.  Yes, if you want to be a Supreme Court justice, you have to go to Yale/Harvard Law -- and you <i>must finish</i> those degrees.  If you want to be a neurosurgeon, you <i>must finish</i> medical school.  But the tech dollars funding programmers are saying something else.<p>So I ask as an informal survey, would you guys prefer to hire (or invest in) a dropout from MIT? or a graduate of Alabama Uni Computer Science?  What&#x27;s more important?  The admissions filter at a top-ranked school? or the classes completed at a low-ranked one?<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Liberal-Education-Fareed-Zakaria/dp/0393247686"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Liberal-Education-Fareed-Zakar...</a>",1433338532

After high school I went to Penn (Wharton) to study finance. I dropped out in my second year (long story there). I bounced around doing a few random but fun things before I decided to give programming a go as a career.<p>My first &quot;tech job&quot; was as a freelance VBA programmer and Excel expert. Pretty much the only class at Penn that came easily to me was called Operations and Information Management 101. It was basically an intro to advanced Excel techniques. I took what I learned there, and a few things from elsewhere, and contracted out to anyone in New York (where I&#x27;m from) that needed Excel work. It was shockingly lucrative. After that I moved to Austin and taught Ruby and database technologies at a coding bootcamp. Now I work at a company that does managed WordPress hosting (I write Ruby for them).<p>With the exception of a couple of my first contracts no one ever really thought much of the fact that I dropped out of college after three semesters.

Yes doctors, as with professionals in other fields are encouraged  to keep up to date with the literature.<p>However they&#x27;re exquisitely busy people, and no one is paying them to spend the time to keep up to date. Sure, there are programs that encourage it (usually called &#x27;Continuing Medical Education&#x27;) but they&#x27;re often very weak, easily ignored and there is a lot of pushback by doctors themselves against them).

This is because 99% of advisors (in the US) already have access to tools like this, except much more in depth and integrated with their trading systems. It&#x27;s in every broker-dealer&#x27;s (the companies whose investment products the advisors are selling) best interest to provide as much sales support and tooling as possible to their registered reps, so many of them provide things like this free of charge.<p>Aside from that, unless this has been vetted and audited by FINRA or a registered CRCP, the chances that any compliance officer (which every RIA is required to have), are virtually non-existent. I haven&#x27;t dug into the platform to see what type of guidance you&#x27;re offering/presenting, but you need to be really careful about what advice you give or state that you give. As in the US, anything even remotely related to any investment vehicle is highly regulated and providing guidance and advice without the required registrations, licenses and oversight can and will land you in very hot water, very fast.<p>All that said, I think with the right approach, something like this could be great for personal use as long as it integrated with multiple investment companies and could track and recommend based on all of them.",1433338337

First of all, there is a huge priority on being first to market. They stand to make hundreds of millions if their drug is approved before their competitors, and they can be the sole option for even 6 momths. Doing prolonged preclinical research to delay registration trials and FDA approval makes no sense to them. Secondly, the fact is that they make more money if we just give the drug to everyone. It takes 3 doses or so before doctors can work out if a drug works or not. So if we give 100% of cancer patients at least 3 doses, they profit more than if we give it to just the 30 - 60% that could benefit the most.<p>So although you are right that encouraging or forcing companies to come up with companion biomarkers that predict efficacy is a good way to reduce cost, in reality it is not so simple.<p>The hype about these latest immunotherapy drugs is so massive (and much of it is justified) that pharma has everyone over the barrel, they will charge the earth and get away with it.",1433337388

There is already an ecosystem of devices that support things like Bluetooth, AirPlay, etc. so when your receiver has them, it&#x27;s actually kind of useful.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought that the reason for keeping Android as open source was to enable this use case. Eventually, Android-capable SOCs will come down to a very low price point, and for these use cases they don&#x27;t need to push much more than a few kb per second. But it retains the advantage of having a development ecosystem that is well understood and widely available (you can&#x27;t throw a rock in China or India without hitting an Android developer).",1433336626

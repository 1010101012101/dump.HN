It would be surprising if after expenses Ms. Torii (whose success is extremely atypical) is still in the black a few years from now.  Making serious long-term money is rare enough among pros.  People day-trading from home don't stand a chance.",1189983459

  <p>They are notorious for their strategy of backing out of deals with small independent software developers (like a lot of us) and having that code conveniently show up in the next version of their OS.<p>Here's one example:
 
<a href=""http://judiciary.senate.gov/oldsite/jeffress.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://judiciary.senate.gov/oldsite/jeffress.htm</a><p>""At one point, we nearly sold our product to Microsoft. In January 1996, Microsoft invited us to its Redmond campus. It told us it was interested in acquiring Electronic TV Host and in hiring our employees. We understood that Microsoft would continue to offer our electronic television guide as a stand-alone computer program. We were excited. We shared our technology with Microsoft, and all our hard-earned insight about the industry. We even shared our business plan. <p>Then, negotiations broke down over price. Microsoft wanted to purchase us for less than half the price we offered. Microsoft told us that if we didn't sell at its price, Microsoft would compete directly against us. Of course, Microsoft could compete against us very effectively: it has the resources, and it has our hard-earned knowledge.""<p>You can google hundreds of others yourself.<p>Whoever can stay in business while still paying their lawyers wins.  Nice.

55401,comment,54978,55241,0,0,steve,,,"Interesting, but this is just stupid:<p>> Here's a tip. If you want to make money, why not offer something of real value to your visitors like a product or service. Provide content that is so good that people will want to pay for it. That's called doing good business.<p>If sites supported entirely by advertising had no ""real value"" then people probably wouldn't be using them so much... The commenter has no clue about internet ""business.""<p>> Begging people to look at your ads for junk they neither want or need is nothing but ad welfare.<p>And this is exactly the FAULT of google. It is incredibly counter-productive that publishers cannot directly support the advertised products as is the case with CPC advertising.",1189980354
55400,comment,55371,55397,0,0,edw519,,,"I once did a post-mortem on 700 IT software requests over an 18 month period.  I came to the conclusion that 95% of them were to change THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN RELEASED.  In other words, 10 programmers were kept busy in a $100 million company FIXING THEIR OWN BUGS.  The business wasn't changing so much to require them; their own incomplete work made them necessary.<p>Sure, you can work on perfect so hard that you never release anything.  OTOH, there's a lot to be said for high quality work.

55399,comment,55363,55393,0,0,rms,,,"OK, I recognize that there is potential for important/big/profitable Facebook Apps. So far, there hasn't been one, just developers making revenue by driving traffic to other Facebook Apps. My message to the original poster is that it will take a company making a really unique Facebook app to get YC funding.<p>If someone had an idea for a Facebook app that had the equivalent market potential of Xobni, things would be different, but I don't think anyone has had an idea like that. Except maybe Parakey, but that wasn't originally intended as a Facebook app.<p>For now, if you're making a Facebook app, it seems like a good idea to use it to get some initial users via Facebook's friendly viralness and then launch a spin-off site on the open web, like Lending Tree did.",1189980092

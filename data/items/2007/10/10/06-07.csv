Thanks for your kind words.<p>Update about sorting the links by access time: my sorting-fu on javascript isn't that great, and it doesn't seem as easy as in perl/python/ruby.<p>A second complication: I currently have code in there to watch out for duplicate cookies in case somebody upgraded to the script after using your bookmarklet for a while. I'll pull that code out in a few days. That should make the sorting code simpler.",1191998074

65699,comment,65081,65612,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... Live blogging is an interesting aspect of the blogosphere. Bloggers post in real-time, often while attending an event, chiming in live with their thoughts and views. This is a great way for bloggers to communicate with their readers, but it's currently not well supported in blogging tools. ...""</i><p>One start would be to create an opensource wordpress plugin + a client side  browser bit of js code to support it. That way each user could support their own comment systems for each place they comment. The bit that currently alludes me is the discovery bit. How do others know you have commented on a particular site? <p>One way could be to publish say RSS feeds that link to sites you have commented on allowing others to discover what others have said. That or some sort of microformat that marks up some page that people read. This would not be real-time though.  Commercial sites have an advantage here as they have a centralised place people can look. <p>Maybe the solution is to offer a commercial discovery site that acts as a registry of comments. So for example:<p>- user John writing using open source firefox plugin you make some comments on a third party site say hackernews<p>- plugin sends comments back to your open source wordpress blog, adds comments to blog then generates new RSS feed of comment detailing comments + discovery information (blog, url etc).<p>- wordpress pings a commercial site <i>""CommentsRUs.com""</i> that pulls the RSS file, parses it and either creates a new entry for a particular site, adds comment.<p>- user Jane who has subscribed to  CommentsRUs.com, HackerNews site is notified by twitter that John has responded to a HackerNews article she has also commented on<p>- user Jane makes another comment and CommentsRUs.com either notifies user John or makes an entry on his homepage <a href=""http://commentsrus.com/person/john/hackernews/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commentsrus.com/person/john/hackernews/</a>  so he can follow the thread.<p>Of course this is no substitute for the original site because the annoying thing is the meta data is not captured. Then again if they did have some mechanism to capture the metadata ( <a href=""http://goonmail.customer.netspace.net.au/hackerid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goonmail.customer.netspace.net.au/hackerid</a> ) you can do lots of useful things. <p>",1191997642

65693,comment,65566,65566,0,0,Alex3917,,,"There are actually a number of legitimate reasons for typing URLs into Google instead of the address bar. For example, public computers in foreign countries are often configured to redirect .com requests to the national TLD. So it's much faster to type amazon.com into Google than it is to figure out how to make Amazon.com stop resolving to Amazon.cn or whatever.",1191996407

9260109,comment,9256209,9259540,0,0,barosl,,,"> I prefer coroutines over state machines<p>And that&#x27;s why Python supports `asyncio` (not to be confused with `asyncore` which is obsolete). So I prefer:<p><pre><code>  sock = yield from connect(&#x27;localhost&#x27;, 7942)
  msg = yield from read_message(sock)
  print(msg)
</code></pre>
to this callback hell:<p><pre><code>  connect(&#x27;localhost&#x27;, 7942, function(sock) {
      read_message(sock, function(msg)) {
          console.log(msg);
      });
  });
</code></pre>
And they&#x27;re completely equivalent. Why would someone actually <i>like</i> the latter, except you&#x27;re forced to use it because of the prevalence of JavaScript?<p>`asyncio` is not only easier to use than the traditional &quot;manual&quot; state machines with classes, but also much faster than something like `Twisted`. In my crappy local benchmark[1], it easily beat `Twisted` in a considerable margin. That may be because of the flaws in my test code, but still their performance is on par. I see no points in relying on callback hell, at least in Python, except the lack of the libraries that support asyncio, which makes me a little bit sad.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/barosl/ws-bench"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/barosl/ws-bench</a>",1427237733

I&#x27;m not a cement/concrete expert, but PC 32.5 does seem to be a low grade.  Higher than PKC 32.5 (composite cement) but lower than PC 42.5.  So I found this other source that puts it in stark terms [2]:<p><pre><code>    According to the China Cement Association, low-grade cement products 
    (all 32.5 grade) accounted for 72% of the total cement output in China 
    in 2013, with the P.C. 32.5 grade cement accounting for 54%.
</code></pre>
So 72% of cement was 32.5 grade, and most of that (54/72%) is PC 32.5.  I was a bit skeptical at first, but now I really wonder if/when these structures start to crack &/ crumble.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://ftalphaville.tumblr.com/post/100653486301/contextualising-chinas-cement-splurge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftalphaville.tumblr.com/post/100653486301/contextuali...</a><p>[2]  <a href=""http://pg.jrj.com.cn/acc/Res/CN_RES/INDUS/2014/2/19/c6835c29-bc15-490c-ac73-83b64cdecd86.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pg.jrj.com.cn/acc/Res/CN_RES/INDUS/2014/2/19/c6835c29...</a>",1427235778

Simply stated, diesel should “work” in the US.<p>“But what do Britons know about our market?” an American might opine. Quite a lot. In significant ways, the diesel market in the US is similar to that of the UK three decades ago.<p>In the UK of the 1980s, diesel drivers were outcasts. They were required to fill up around the back of the station, over by the truckers, to be looked upon by gasoline burners with a mixture of pity and smugness. And that presumed diesel drivers could even find somewhere to fill up, as not every filling station bothered to stock their fuel.<p>This sheer lack of availability led to great variability in pricing. As the only filling-station proprietor in 25 miles to stock diesel, Mr. Smith could subsequently charge more or less whatever he wanted. A survey of diesel prices in the US illustrates a similarly maddening snapshot of how scarcity can produce wide price fluctuations, with pump prices varying by up to 50 cents a gallon. But with more diesel purchasers, the laws of the marketplace would kick in, bringing prices into greater alignment.<p>Given the need for low-sulphur refining, diesel would not necessarily become cheaper than premium in the US. It is pricier on the other side of the Pond, too, but although Europeans gripe about it, they still know the savings add up. Diesel generally returns 30% better mileage than gas, and in the dominion of $8 gallons, this is no small advantage.<p>Mind you, there are two distinct factors working in favour of Europeans’ wallets: fuel with a higher cetane rating, which makes it easier to control NOx emissions, and EU emissions standards that are generally comparable to the US’s Tier 2 standards in all areas apart from, yes, NOx. Even our EU 6 standards, due in 2015, do not quite match the States’ strict limits on smog- and acid rain-causing emissions.<p>Relative to a gasoline-burning engine, it is more difficult to control NOx in a diesel, which is why, to meet those comparatively stricter emissions limits, diesels in the US are required to use expensive, onboard after-treatment systems, which decrease the amount of particulate matter that leaves the tailpipe. Diesel engines are already more expensive to develop than gasoline units, given their turbos and complex injection systems. After-treatment systems make them even pricier.<p>Here’s the thing: It’s worth it. Diesel used to be a dirty fuel and a dirty word, but recent technologies have addressed both problems, which is why the world outside the United States thinks of the choice between gasoline and diesel as a foregone conclusion. And even with the additional costs, passed on to the consumer, of emissions compliance equipment, the sensory pleasures of a diesel-powered vehicle are difficult to deny.<p>It is high time, America, to give diesels a better look.</i>",1427235763

A survey of diesel prices in the US illustrates a similarly maddening snapshot of how scarcity can produce wide price fluctuations, with pump prices varying by up to 50 cents a gallon. But with more diesel purchasers, the laws of the marketplace would kick in, bringing prices into greater alignment.
Given the need for low-sulphur refining, diesel would not necessarily become cheaper than premium in the US. It is pricier on the other side of the Pond, too, but although Europeans gripe about it, they still know the savings add up. Diesel generally returns 30% better mileage than gas, and in the dominion of $8 gallons, this is no small advantage.<p>Mind you, there are two distinct factors working in favour of Europeans’ wallets: fuel with a higher cetane rating, which makes it easier to control NOx emissions, and EU emissions standards that are generally comparable to the US’s Tier 2 standards in all areas apart from, yes, NOx. Even our EU 6 standards, due in 2015, do not quite match the States’ strict limits on smog- and acid rain-causing emissions.<p>Relative to a gasoline-burning engine, it is more difficult to control NOx in a diesel, which is why, to meet those comparatively stricter emissions limits, diesels in the US are required to use expensive, onboard after-treatment systems, which decrease the amount of particulate matter that leaves the tailpipe. Diesel engines are already more expensive to develop than gasoline units, given their turbos and complex injection systems. After-treatment systems make them even pricier.
Here’s the thing: It’s worth it. Diesel used to be a dirty fuel and a dirty word, but recent technologies have addressed both problems, which is why the world outside the United States thinks of the choice between gasoline and diesel as a foregone conclusion. And even with the additional costs, passed on to the consumer, of emissions compliance equipment, the sensory pleasures of a diesel-powered vehicle are difficult to deny.<p>It is high time, America, to give diesels a better look.</i>",1427235592

It failed spectacularly since it was not rugged enough to withstand the pressures of compression combustion. Plus GM had a crisis of quality at the time so it just sucked. While you could get German diesels all the while it was too expensive to be mainstream and most people&#x27;s experience with diesel is that of heavy duty trucks. These are noisy, produce huge amounts of soot and are sometimes(note the word sometimes) driven by folks who must compensate for their manhood with such niceties as Calvin pissing on a different brands logo, taking the engine branding and making it a sexual double entendre, putting a giant 8&quot; exhaust pipe in the bed(or more than one) or the ever popular set of testicles hanging from the bumper.

IMO, if your business model is to horde something scarce in order to sell it to someone else, you aren&#x27;t generating value, you&#x27;re just parasitic drag on those who do. Domains should be part of the &quot;commons&quot;. If you want to profit from a domain, <i>do</i> something with it.",1427234849

He apologized, but kept doing it.  He kept getting answers, and kept learning.<p>Last I heard, he&#x27;d gone on to be a team lead, then run his own, successful company.  He didn&#x27;t let fear of public annoyance or seeming stupid hinder his own progress.<p>I&#x27;m not saying everyone should gleefully annoy others, but I&#x27;ve met far, far too many technical people who spend more time on their anxiety than they spend on actually learning and doing.

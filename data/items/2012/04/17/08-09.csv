3851798,comment,3851482,3851751,3,0,omershapira,,,"The ""disruption"" is the promise to get 12-bit RAW out of it for this cheap. It isn't necessarily disruptive (RED cameras are still competitively priced, considering the budgets of productions that could harness what RAW has to offer), but it's an interesting promise. Then again - just because it's RAW, doesn't mean that it's divine. Before a raw signal becomes a RAW file, it still has to go through a Wavelet/DCT compressor and might end up not being very useful. RED cameras have between 1:3 and 1:18 Wavelet compression. It's RAW, so nothing is pixelated, but you can't argue with entropy, and trying to only gets you more noise.<p>In other words, RAW could be a buzzword, Blackmagic are new to sensors, this might be a big hoax, but having a perfect track record with Blackmagic products so far, I'd consider switching, which is sort of what you're looking for when you say 'disruptive'.",1334653142

Zend aren't going anywhere and their framework is a big part of their offering, tying in to all their products, so they have plans for it.<p>There are issues however with performance, I've found. A brand new project loads in ~40ms, and that's before you've done any work at all. Add in some forms with Zend_Form and other bits of functionality and you can start to see page load jump over 500ms (though admittedly this is in part due to poor base code written by the company). Zend Framework 2 however is no better - performance is far far worse than Zend Framework 1.* currently. I have also seen some very bad reviews of ZF2, comparing it to Java applications in verbosity and complexity.<p>I can't recommend any other framework as I don't code in PHP at home, I use Django for personal projects, however I can say that I've heard very good things about Kohana.",1334651282

3851728,comment,3849203,3849569,4,0,enobrev,,,"The hard part is finding the ""well-written source code"".  Sure there are plenty that have been battle-tested for years, which we can refer to, but every day we come across tens to hundreds of github links.  Some are legible.  Some are clever but maybe interesting.  Some are in need of serious refactoring.  Some are first-attempts.  Some are ""drunken rants"" (usually < 10 checkins, with every file marked as 6+ months ago).  And once in a great while, some are worth some serious attention.<p>I ""grew up"" in PHP, and while the majority of the open source code I've read has been difficult to parse, at best, I've read some amazing code.  Most from intelligent peers for whom I still hold a deep respect.<p>It's what has kept me inspired.  It's what brought me to eventually appreciate Javascript (server and browser), Actionscript (3), Java, Python, C, Ruby, a few others, most recently including Clojure. And when it comes to amazing code (regardless of language), I will gladly sit and read with more intrigue than the best fiction has to offer.<p>It's the massive amount of mediocre or less that defines the divide making source code painful.  I skim a lot.  I look for whitespace, the occasional well-written comment block, proper variable / method naming, things to hint that this was written to be read by another human who likes to read, and from there I dig in deeper with the hopes that I have something worth reading.<p>That is to say, I LOVE to read code, but it can be difficult to find the code worthy of the smoking jacket and voting-age scotch.",1334651203

The fractal complexity of software means there are often unknown unknowns waiting inside various libraries and architectures that you plan to use.

Sometimes business requirements dictate otherwise, but that will always lead to a suboptimal solution.<p>I think that may be the key reason why I prefer startups to other forms of programming work: in a startup you can not afford to do anything for ceremony or to CYA, the focus on optimizing the product must be relentless.",1334651005

Like I said, libertarianism provides no mechanism for levelling the playing field - those born into poverty are frequently not even <i>aware</i> that they can better themselves, let alone how. Libertarianism does not address this issue, instead promoting a system that <i>sounds</i> nice on paper, but significantly benefits those born into privilege.<p>The slogans of libertarianism are nice and catchy, but the devil is in the detail. If you're not skilled, white, male, and healthy, there's a good chance of falling through the cracks.<p>><i>If libertarians really believed that the poor get what they deserve, why would they donate to charity?</i><p>The one and only libertarian I've debated that did mention that they personally gave to charity did so as a boast (""I supplied two trucks full of stuff to Katrina victims"", within the context of 'this is more than you gave'). No other libertarian I've talked to has mentioned giving themselves, it's always a shout-out to faceless 'private charity'. I'm not saying that libertarians don't give, but they don't seem to be great at giving positive examples of libertarian charity.<p>><i>I can't find any statistics to back this up.</i><p>Can you find any statistics to refute it? If not, you're only making half an argument. I can't find any references saying that astronauts didn't land on the sun, does that mean they did?<p>><i>You have enough sample data to associate the word ""mankind"" with libertarians? Or are you more likely to take notice of the word's use when engaging with libertarians?</i><p>I was raised by a feminist and have been noticing the word 'mankind' stick out like a sore thumb for over 20 years. I've only known about libertarianism as a philosophy for about 10, so it's fair to say that no, I don't just notice it more with libertarians. Libertarian dialogue is frequently sexist ('mankind' and 'rights of man' are common) and commonly makes no acknowledgement of issues that affect women (like what happens to mothers, who bear the vast brunt of the parenting load and have less opportunity to skill up).<p>The thing is, libertarianism promotes itself as being fair and egalitarian - if it were <i>really</i> about this, libertarians would self-police their own dialogue about this overtly sexist crap. They don't, and when called on it, they get defensive (as you have) and explain it away, rather than say 'my bad' and admit that they weren't being egalitarian. I personally find that this is just more support to the idea that libertarianism is really - perhaps subconsciously - about preserving existing privilege.<p>I don't know if you're a libertarian or not, but you are making some of the logical errors that libertarians do.",1334650773

That's capitalism.<p>Social entrepreneurialism, making a dent in the universe, helping those less fortunate, those are all awesome things.

That's a lot of weed...<p>EDIT: from <a href=""http://www.canorml.org/background/CA_legalization.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canorml.org/background/CA_legalization.html</a>:<p>""Over 1.6 million Californians have smoked marijuana within the past 30 days, according to the most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, which found 5.6% of all Americans over age 12 are current marijuana users. Insofar as these figures are based on self-reporting of illicit activity, they are undoubtedly on the low side.<p>According to the survey, one-third of this population, or 530,000 Californians, are daily users.<p>The bulk of consumption is accounted for by ""regular"" users, who consume marijuana at least several times per week. Included is a small minority of very heavy smokers (10 or more joints per day), who push the average consumption figures upwards. According to a British survey by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit [1], ""regular"" users average 2 oz of cannabis per month or about 2 grams per day (a gram yields one or two joints). The population of regular users is somewhat larger than that of daily users. Assuming 600,000 - 700,000 ""regular users"" in California averaging 2 grams per day, consumption by this group accounts for 1.2 to 1.4 million grams per day. Assuming the remaining 1 million monthly users average one joint every 10 days, this adds another 100,000 grams per day. Total marijuana consumption by Californians may therefore be reasonably estimated at 1.3 to 1.5 million grams per day, or about 1 to 1.2 million pounds per year.""",1247711415

The text field I am typing this into, for example.  I type on my keyboard and the state of the text field changes, and after I hit &quot;reply&quot;, the state of the page changes with a comment appended.  Before/after.<p>Yes, you can <i>implement</i> this by creating a completely new page containing the concatenation of the old page with the comment, but externally (when you visit the URL), the state of that page has changed.  So if you choose to implement the problem in a functional style, you have to bridge that gap somehow between that style and the problem at hand.<p>Any sort of document processing done on computers in Word, Excel (regarding the document itself, not the one way dataflow constraint program inside), OpenOffice, PowerPoint, Pages, Keynote, Quark XPress, InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator etc.   People use these programs to change the state of documents.  That is the purpose of these programs.<p>Anything that interacts with the world, for example the user interface.<p>Or Wikipedia.  Pages change, sometimes because there is new information, sometimes because something in the world has changed.  Or most any other web site.<p>Really, the world (a) has (a lot of) state and (b) that state is changing incessantly.  It is not (a) stateless or (b) immutable.<p>But don&#x27;t take it from me:  &quot;In the end, <i>any</i> program must manipulate state.  If it doesn&#x27;t, there is no point in running it.

Technically the Surface Pro 2 is able to connect to both of them over its one Mini-DP Connector via DP 1.2 Daisy Chaining, but since those Monitors only support DP 1.1. i tried connecting them over the MSI Multi-Stream-Transport Hub, which didn&#x27;t work reliably enough, the monitors weren&#x27;t always recognized instantly and it felt to fickle to work with. The solution was an older USB3 DisplayLink DisplayPort Adapter. It works much better than I expected and I can dock and undock as often as i want without the configuration or drivers becoming unstable which was my main concern.<p>Monitor TL;DR: 2x 2540x1440 Monitors, one via Mini-DP, one via USB3.<p>There is only one USB3 Bus on the Dockingstation for the SP2 and sadly Microsoft has cheaped out on the Ethernet Port for the Dockingstation as its only 100mbit. (The Dock is only Connected via one USB3 Port, one Mini-DP Port and its Power Connector, so guess they wanted to save the usb bandwidth since most people don&#x27;t need >100mbit anyway) As i&#x27;ve got a 1 Gbit Line (we work next to a server farm) at my office i didn&#x27;t want to compromise on that too much, so i&#x27;ve attached an USB3 Hub with included Gigabit Ethernet Port which is hidden with all cabling under the Desk. With the USB Monitor switched off i get about 800mbit over the card, with the USB Monitor it varies between 300mbit and 650mbit, depending on what is going on at the Monitor at the time.<p>Network TL;DR: External USB3 Gigabit Adapter, between 300-650mbit throughput.<p>We&#x27;re a JS and PHP Webdevshop mostly, so I run PHPStorm on it, often alongside Photoshop CC 2014 to review Designs. The hardware takes that beautifully, but i can push it towards its limits when opening 2-3 animation-heavy sites in Chrome with the debugger open. Thats the only performance painpoint that i&#x27;d like to see wiped out when i&#x27;ll buy my next Surface, i guess when they roll out the 4th or 5th gen. I&#x27;ve also ran Eclipse on it for Android Development and again, no problem there aswell, so i would guess Visual Studio would run on it nicely aswell. Unity3D runs nicely to do quick prototypes, but its obviously limited to the graphics capabilities of the Intel i5-4200u it runs on, so its okay for a Game Jam, but I (obviously to me) couldn&#x27;t recommend it as a professional GameDev device. I&#x27;ve got the top model with 512GB SSD since it&#x27;s supposed to last me 2-4 years atleast, i&#x27;d just hope for 16GB of Ram so I wouldn&#x27;t have any regrets when opening multiple browser VMs (IE6-7-8-9 in parallel running vms with 6-8 each getting 1gb of ram and 9 2gb makes it run sluggish aswell), but I didn&#x27;t find that in any notebook under 1.5kg so I compromized on that with the Surface and am not disappointed.<p>Software TL;DR: PHPStorm & Adobe Suite run alongside beautifully, more graphics power would be nice, but i don&#x27;t really need it. If you NEED to run >5GB RAM of VMs, this device isn&#x27;t for you.<p>With PHPStorm in PowerSaving Mode it lasts me about 5 hours before I need to find a plug, which is okay but I hope it to improve in the next iteration I get.<p>Battery TL;DR: 5 hours.<p>I have an IKEA BEKANT electric standing desk[1] and the cables are all tugged tightly under it and out of the way.

I carry my Surface around in a small vertical messenger bag [3] which contains beside the Surface Power cable an Jabra Speak 510 portable bluetooth conference speaker[4], an Logitech R800 Presenter[5] and an EasyAcc Battery Pack[6] which I can charge with the integrated USB Charger in the Surface Poweradapter.<p>My whole setup is geared towards me being always ready to do intensive dev work while staying mobile enough to jump up and do sales or community management and the Surface fits that purpose perfectly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/S29022539/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/S29022539/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_wireless_charger"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_wirel...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/CaseCrown-Resistant-Vertical-Messenger-Microsoft/dp/B009RV2B5A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1411627490&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/CaseCrown-Resistant-Vertical-Messenger...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Jabra-SPEAK-510-Bluetooth-Softphone/dp/B00AQUO5RI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1411627614&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Jabra-SPEAK-510-Bluetooth-Softphone/dp...</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Professional-Presenter-Green-Pointer/dp/B002GHBUTU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1411627671&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Professional-Presenter-Green-...</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/EasyAcc-10000mAh-Brilliant-Portable-PB10000C/dp/B00H9BEC8E/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1411628017&sr=8-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/EasyAcc-10000mAh-Brilliant-Portable-PB...</a>",1411628751

Only Germans seem to learn about their own country&#x27;s atrocities in school/media. (I&#x27;ll add Russia to the list of Turkey, Pakistan, Japan, ...)<p>A brutal dictatorship, as Putin seem to work towards, means that the controlling junta can treat the people as their own property.<p>As I wrote: If you have to lock people up to stop them from fleeing -- and the guards even shoot on sight! -- it shows the relationship; leaving is theft of valuable property, i.e. a slavery situation.<p>I have worked in Romania and have read/heard about how the spine of the people were broken and how they were controlled.<p>For example: There were some German speaking people since the Middle Ages in Transylvania. The adults were sent to Siberia. The broken survivors did get home, years later... Another example: Political prisoners (but at least not &quot;criminals&quot; which had just refused to sign over their land to the Party), were just not going to survive prison.<p>And so on.<p>(Pre-60s Africa, during colonialism? Well, that is at least different compared to the usual Soviet argument of blacks in USA. :-) )",1411628748

8365976,comment,8365158,8365852,8,0,bodyfour,,,"The only attack vectors I&#x27;ve seen so far are:<p>* webservers that are configured to run things via the ancient CGI interface.  There are lots of these on the internet (so that&#x27;s bad) but most OSes aren&#x27;t going to be vulnerable out of the box or anything.  Also, the biggest risk is if you&#x27;re on a server where /bin/sh is bash, which is not the case for Ubuntu.<p>* people using sshd <i>and</i> have users that are allowed to ssh but not run a shell -- for instance by having &quot;command=&quot; settings in a .ssh/authorized_keys file.  Most people won&#x27;t have this.  It&#x27;s a pattern most associated with services like github which allows you to use git-over-ssh but not run arbitrary programs on their servers.  Another example would be if you&#x27;ve set up a special key for a backup system to connect over ssh and run rsync.  Most servers aren&#x27;t going to have these things.  If you&#x27;re just using sshd for normal user logins there is no impact: you can &quot;exploit&quot; the bug and run arbitrary commands, but only if you have the same credentials you could have used to log in and run them yourself anyway.<p>* DHCP clients could be affected, but only if the server is already compromised (or spoofed) which probably isn&#x27;t a huge concern for your home network.<p>So you&#x27;re probably overreacting here.  Certainly stay up-to-date on the patches as they come out for safety, though.",1411628727

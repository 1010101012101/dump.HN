A used paperback is often cheaper than an eBook.\n  * With paper I have sense of progress as I feel the right half of the book shrink as I read.\n  * I can easily lend a friend a paper book, I have shared many books with people recently but with the Kindle they had to buy their own.\n</code></pre>\nHowever I still think the Kindle paperwhite is one of the best single-purpose electronic devices ever (rivaling the iPod Classics).

The songs need to be adjusted so they play at the same speed(tempo), or they will drift apart over time. You generally adjust the speed of the muted input so it matches the current bpm.<p>3. Songs have a definite phrasing, often broken into recursive layers. Think 4 beats in a bar, 4-8 bars in a phrase, etc...\nYou&#x27;ll need to listen to the new track and position it on the first beat of a phrase, and start it playing when the current track hits its first beat. If the tempos match, you may still need to nudge it forward / back to line up the kicks / snares exactly.<p>4. _only now_ should you really start mixing the new track into the main output. if everything is in sync, its just a matter of balancing the Hi/Mid/Low to avoid them summing too loud. (mixers will show an output meter, we try to sit below 0dB or the sound starts to distort)<p>Software like Traktor, Virtual DJ generally have two controllable players and a virtual mixer, often controlled by MIDI controllers that mirror the layout with faders, knobs and jogwheels. quality is often judged on road-worthiness so don&#x27;t be afraid to try cheaper gear. The main difference will be resolution of controls and extensive mapping to effects and other features, which you shouldn&#x27;t focus on at first...<p>If you have any other questions, fire away. There&#x27;s so so many options these days, and everything&#x27;s so accessible. Think of the above as &#x27;driving a stick&#x27;, there are automatic syncing options if you just want to mix, STEM files (multi channel audio files) if you want to control vocals / drums / bass / lead directly rather than filtering frequencies, check the features pages of some of the DJ software if you haven&#x27;t looked into it much.

That is just one use case.<p>Monads take care of a very common computation pattern: wrapping and unwrapping data from a container to do stuff with it.  This process is error-prone and leads to code bloat if done by hand whenever needed.<p>I mean, how often have you had to apply a function to every element in a vector of values?  fmap takes care of that without having to go into the list, take a value one at a time, and apply the function you want to use.<p>Rather than have to unwrap your container to use functions, a monad offers the means to transform functions to use a monadic container as input instead.  No wrapping or unwrapping by hand required; using bind, fmap, or ap(ply), you transform lots of functions to use the monadic container and build a seamless pipeline for data to traverse.<p>How often have you had to deal with a value that might or might not exist--e.g. searching a string for a substring&#x27;s position?  If you had that problem, you might say, well, I&#x27;m going to return an integer, but a negative number means no match. And then in all code thereafter, I have to check if the integer is negative and do different stuff.  A simple Maybe/Optional monad would take care of all that for you.<p>How often have you had to write verbose output alongside a computation?  You could pepper your code with print statements, but maybe you want that output controlled by some runtime parameter. Would you want to check at every print statement whether that parameter is true?  Or you could use a Writer monad, pass along the verbose output through the computation, with an easy means to transform regular functions into using Writers, and then decide what to do with the output at the end.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s not convenient to try to use monads if the language doesn&#x27;t offer it, or if there&#x27;s not a library to facilitate it (trust me, I know this; I implemented a slew of templates to use monads in C++).<p>But programmers do this stuff all the time: unwrap data, do stuff with it, pack it back up. They do this over and over, repeating themselves, and such repetitive code is a maintenance trap waiting to happen.<p>Monads help you avoid that trap, and they help you take your program and reduce it to &quot;one thing in, one thing out.&quot; Now maybe those &quot;one things&quot; are containers, but linearizing the flow of data this way only helps make the program&#x27;s concept easier to understand.",1443065095

It seems like between every major point release theirs about a ~6 month gap. Furthermore the features in each release (bar migrations in 1.7, which IMO should&#x27;ve been in a loooong time ago) are relatively minor. Django also is fairly quick to deprecate older versions (including python versions) which is fine I guess since they&#x27;re pretty on top of security and provide clear upgrade paths.<p>However the fact remains, as I assessed about two years ago, that the momentum behind the Django ecosystem is as stagnant as ever. Many third-party libraries are deprecated or ill-maintained. This is as much symptomatic of Python as a whole as Django, but regardless it exasperates the slow release cycles when compared to other languages and frameworks.<p>My money is still on JS/Clojure/Erlang/Go/etc. to carry us into the future of web development.

10269624,comment,10268286,10269353,0,0,iofj,,,"> So every country except the US is involved in this hypothetical war? Really?<p>Happened twice in the last century. Even South America was the least affected, but it wasn&#x27;t unaffected, and it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;d generate a huge amount of trade (compared to EU/Asia who would definitely be involved).<p>> If China attacks Japan, even assuming that drags in Vietnam, the Philippines, Korea, and Indonesia that still leaves a whole lot of countries for us to trade with. The idea the S&P would drop by 99% is just daft.<p>Out of the 10 worst stock market crashes, 8 happened during WW2, 7 during the period where the US wasn&#x27;t actively involved in the war. Depending on the date range you pick you could say it dropped 50% in absolute value, or you could say it stayed about constant. This was during a period with >10% average inflation ratio, so that&#x27;s pretty fucking bad. &quot;Real value&quot; of the S&P500 (meaning &quot;how many big macs you could buy&quot; for index shares 1935 to 1950) dropped ~74%. And that&#x27;s still ignoring the fact that many products simply became unavailable, because there was no way to safely acquire them from US soil, at which point price becomes a moot point.<p>This agrees with anecdotal evidence I heard from my grandfather : the beginning of WW2 (I think he means 1938-1939 onwards, when you could still delude yourself there was peace), there was no violence, there was simply a hell of a lot of people going unemployed very fast, shortages of all sorts of stuff, and a lot of rich people suddenly looking for jobs.<p>> Beyond that it&#x27;s not like we can&#x27;t get involved in a war once it starts if we decide it&#x27;s in our interest to do so. War isn&#x27;t like a comedy club where they shut the door once the act starts.<p>True, but at that point the consequences are a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, history, and unchangeable. You don&#x27;t ever want to get to that point if you can avoid it at all.",1443064332
10269623,comment,10268538,10269202,0,0,mikekchar,,,"It doesn&#x27;t annoy me, but I have to say that I think you are wrong ;-).  My google-fu gave me the following definition for communism:<p>&quot;a theory or system of social organization in which all property is owned by the community and each person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs.&quot;<p>I suppose there is some superficial resemblance, but I consider communism a means of doling out limited resources in an equitable fashion.  So instead of having individual ownership, the community owns it and manages it based on need.  Instead of being free to act in your own best interest, you are obliged to contribute to the level of your ability.<p>With FLOSS, we are simply removing the concept that a piece of software is a limited resource.  There is no group ownership -- individuals still own their copyright.  It&#x27;s just that under the rules of the licensing, ownership is irrelevant.<p>For example, I no longer sign inventions agreements at work.  Instead, I tell my employers that all outside work I do will be under the GPL (or AGPL).  I will even assign copyright over to them as long as the code is licensed as GPL.  They can own it.  I don&#x27;t care because it makes no difference who owns it.<p>In a communist society, ownership is still quite important.  It dictates who will decide what I need.  If I owned the resource, I could take as much as I wanted (or give away or sell it if I wanted).  With community ownership, the community decides.  With FLOSS, if I have a copy of the software, it just doesn&#x27;t matter who owns the copyright.  I have the same rights and obligations either way.<p>Another big difference is the reception of the item.  In a communist society, I have a right to the things I need and an obligation to contribute to my ability.  With FLOSS, nobody must give me anything.  If they <i>do</i> happen to give something to me, then I can do what I want with it (up to the limit of impinging other people&#x27;s freedoms in some cases).  But I don&#x27;t have to do anything.<p>This is often a big misunderstanding the neophytes to free software have.  They often demand bug fixes, or they demand to be given software for free.  You just don&#x27;t have that right, even if it is something you need.  Similarly, if I make a change to any software, I needn&#x27;t give that change to anyone.  I am <i>free</i> to do so, but I have no <i>obligation</i>.<p>In summation, I don&#x27;t think this is communism at all. It is simply leveraging the fact that existing software is not a limited resource.  It establishes a set of community rules that optimises the freedom of the members of the community, not the satisfaction of their needs.  Importantly, it does not establish any rights or obligations.<p>The last bit is tricky as you have obligations to offer source code <i>if</i> you choose to distribute, but the &quot;if&quot; part is important.  Similarly, advocates feel that there is a moral imperative to act in a way that preserves software freedom for downstream users, but nobody says that those users have a &quot;right&quot; to the software (in the way that a person has a right to a food in communist society).",1443064315

But, some of the risk factors that you are comparing aren&#x27;t really on the same level. To go back to a bad metaphor again :), what if I stuck a camera with encrypted feeds in your house that you couldn&#x27;t remove, but I told you that they weren&#x27;t attached to anything? and that you could just push this button to turn them off? See, the light goes off. That means it&#x27;s off. Why are you so distrusting? What if they were in every room? over your bed?<p>As you move downward into more primitive levels of the system, or outward to edge parts of the system (ie a usb attachment), it becomes harder to see what&#x27;s going on. For example: let&#x27;s say that you p0wned the firmware on a non-boot SATA drive. You could see all the bits flying across, but you can&#x27;t do much about them except tamper with them; they might be encrypted, or you maybe can&#x27;t get access to the network in order to ship them off elsewhere. There&#x27;s probably ways around each of those, but it&#x27;s hard. But what if I took a Raspberry Pi and stuck it on the system bus? that&#x27;s a different story :)<p>When you have a multi-megabyte secondary server and processor that&#x27;s hooked directly into your system bus, watching everything that comes across and able to subtly react, tamper, watch just for keys, or ship data off elsewhere, then (as you point out) the attack vectors multiply compared to a exploiting a device&#x27;s firmware. And, you can&#x27;t ever get rid of them. EVER. No amount of flashing will fix it, because you can&#x27;t flash it anyway. (That&#x27;s why I posted the libreboot IntelME link).<p>What if just the hardware RNG (rdrand) watched for a particular sequence of bits to come into some registers, and then started spitting out a predictable sequence for random numbers?<p>What if this wasn&#x27;t even a crazy conspiracy theory? (It&#x27;s not, as we know now, although we don&#x27;t know the exact mechanism that hardware RNG&#x27;s are owned by). :(<p>> The IME just allows your computer to do the bidding of some arbitrary third-party that Intel likes (like DRM companies), instead of the code needing to be written by Intel themselves, embedded deep in the CPU&#x27;s internals.<p>Yes, agreed - that&#x27;s a radically different level of surface area.<p>Any firmware can be reflashed, but this isn&#x27;t just any firmware; this is firmware that connects everything together. This is literally the heart of the system. And it&#x27;s completely locked off from our even viewing it, let alone choosing not to using it.<p>> If you&#x27;re an end-user and own your computer, you can disable AMT, and verify that it&#x27;s disabled—the computer will no longer reply to probes on that port<p>Agreed, but you originally said you can disable IME, and that&#x27;s all I was really taking issue with :)<p>Disabling AMT still leaves IME: what is it doing? You don&#x27;t know, and we&#x27;ll never tell you ;)<p>> Everything else is just a dozen new vectors for motivated attackers to do things motivated attackers have always been able to do.<p>Agreed. :(<p>Thank you for the interesting discussion!

This is a discrete, separate part to the main ARM or x86 CPU running Linux (though some SoCs are blurring those lines).<p>We already use firmware blobs on WiFi chips. It&#x27;s why OpenWRT and friends are locked into old kernel versions for some routers: they don&#x27;t have the source to the WiFi radio blob and can&#x27;t recompile or reverse-engineer to make it work on newer kernels with different ABI.

In particular, my statement on affine types. Or, in C++ terms, move semantics by default, instead of copy semantics by default.<p>Raw pointers don&#x27;t deep copy (what would that even mean?) so clearly you&#x27;re only talking about structs that impose special semantics on raw pointers. If those structs were affine (assignment was a move which marked the old copy as unusable), then there would be no need to overload assignment for that facet of safety. They would just be in a different place, which would be fine.<p>The only really special case is having a pointer into yourself (really into yourself, not just into some fixed heap location you own -- basically, caring about your own location in memory). This is the only thing, as far as I can tell, that C++&#x27;s approach gains over affinity. Personally I consider it a bit of a nightmarish thing to do without GC (it&#x27;s a bit nasty even with it TBH), but I know all too well that people will demand anything and everything; especially once they&#x27;re used to it. Although this wouldn&#x27;t completely preclude this pattern, it just means you can&#x27;t wrap it up in a pseudo-safe way -- particularly if you want to pass it to arbitrary client code.<p>However this would be a massive break from C, which is copy semantics all the way down. I suppose C++ could have further given the `class` keyword meaning by making all classes affine. I dunno if people would have tolerated that kind of difference at the time.

10269583,comment,10266447,10266447,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"There are three huge problems that e-books haven&#x27;t solved, which has been holding them back.<p>First, consumer surplus. (Read this if you haven&#x27;t: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckie...</a>) Printed books use different editions and market availability to segment the market and bring in a significant amount of consumer surplus revenue. e-books have very weak mechanisms to capture consumer surplus, and that represents a huge potential loss of revenue. In theory it might be possible to make that up on the other end with higher volume (see, for example, steam sales and humble bundles) but so far e-book sales models have been too constrained to enable that to happen very often.<p>Second, commodity pricing. This is a big problem across the board in a lot of media (games, movies, music, etc.) but e-books have just doubled down on the same model. Books are not like dried beans, you don&#x27;t just go to a store and buy books by the pound, but that&#x27;s the model the industry has increasingly been rushing towards. With only popularity as the sole determinant of total revenue. This is a massively flawed model that hurts many talented writers and perverts the market in unhealthy ways.<p>Third, ownership. People with physical books can gift them to others, or sell them, or loan them. They can let their friends, their children, their other relatives, or their family&#x27;s friends borrow them and read them. They are a profound asset of learning and shared culture. An e-book, however, is still by default a jealously guarded personal possession that cannot be easily loaned, sold, gifted, or inherited. Given the importance of books, this is a profound disadvantage of e-books.<p>Fourth, vendor lock-in. The average user experience with e-books represents a substantial dependency on a particular corporation (such as Amazon). If, say, Amazon went out of business it could be especially difficult to gain access to ones Amazon purchased e-books. Imagine, for example, some sort of world-wide disaster, and now there are no more new kindles, no more Amazon, etc. What happens when your one device storing all your books finally dies? This is similar to the ownership problem. Buying an e-book today is partly making a bet that the company that sold you that e-book will be around for as long as that book is relevant. Given the history of both corporations and of books, that&#x27;s actually not a very smart bet.<p>e-books have a lot of short-term advantages but they have a lot of long-term disadvantages, at least as they exist today. That&#x27;s not an intractable problem but it&#x27;s one that so far the big powers in the e-book world have been deaf to hearing.",1443063717

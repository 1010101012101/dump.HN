We strongly market/urge managers to expose this data to their employees and allow them to see how they compare to the average on their team, but they don't HAVE to do that.<p>The ""spectrums"" of evil that we deal with are:<p>Open vs. stealth: Right now RescueTime can't be stealthy, but there are certainly settings (academic labs trying to understand utilization) where stealth might be appropriate.<p>and<p>Exposure of worker data to managers (customers): How much detail do we expose to the manager beyond the team averages/totals?  Due to customer demand, we've exposed some high level individual data to managers.<p>and<p>How much data we collect in a workplace.  We're not budging here and are sticking with time/attention data.

If you end up on a Star Wars site, you've missed; there's a real such thing that has flown in real space.<p>You can't launch on an Ion drive, though. (Even if you made it powerful enough, that would mean irradiating the entire launch area with instantly-lethal radiation, not a terribly social thing to do.) The way to a solar-powered launch is that you use solar power to create the rocket fuel, which in the simplest case is simply cracking water into H and O.<p>Solar panels are orders of magnitude away from being able to launch themselves in real time. Take a solar panel, compute its mass, compute how much energy it can generate in a day, convert that to potential energy in Earth's gravitational field, and you'll get a sense of the maximum speed a panel could possibly rise with perfect conversion of energy to height (which we have no idea how to do anyhow). I haven't done the math but if you get a rise rate of more than a few inches a second during the brightest part of the day I'd be surprised.",1232553521

One for Math PhDs, Chemistry PhDs, just having a bachelor's degree, CEO's, car salesmen, etc.  The barrier to entry filter just assures that the community members share experience or ability, not just interest.  The extent to which you wanted to quantify their experience or ability is up to you.<p>I see TED as the ultimate meritocracy-based conference.  TED's official website is pretty fluffy about who gets invited to speak, but the reality is that everyone who gets on stage has done something amazing.  If you're some college freshmen with an amazing idea to change the world but you haven't implemented it, you're not going to get invited to TED.  Great ideas are a dime a dozen; implementing a great idea is what's amazing.<p>When I referenced ""those sorts of comments/attitudes would be voted down"" I was not referring to your post.

On the other hand, I have been with T-Mobile for 5 years and like the service so the G1 was an easy choice.

443335,comment,443131,443131,0,0,mdasen,,,"The problem is that bandwidth is a finite shared resource (much in the way that clean, potable water is).  For most of us, there's more than we would ever want or need.  We watch some online videos, download a few large files each month, and do use a fair bit, but not an excessive amount.  Of course, there are always people that think they should have a golf course in their back yard.<p>I'm worried about usage caps and throttling as well, but I also know that at my university, about 50 people used up more than 50% of total network bandwidth.  If the university didn't give priority to certain types of traffic (small HTTP, Skype, etc.) over other types (BitTorrent, Kazaa, etc.), the majority would have had a less enjoyable experience.<p>I think the solution should be something that both protects a shared resource while allowing people access and usage of the range of services one can use.  I think it's reasonable to say that some services are higher priority than P2P filesharing and the routers than an ISP is going to have can easily handle creating differing priorities.  That's an easy first step and it's still neutral to the source of the traffic (Google has argued that the problems with the ISP plans are that they want to offer high speed traffic from site A and slow from site B rather than differing on types of traffic).  I also don't think it's unreasonable for excessive users to get friendly warnings that their usage is high along with help on lowering their usage.  In terms of what is excessive usage: I'd say that 463GB is excessive in a month. Why 463GB?  It's the capacity of a fully-loaded T1 connection costing hundreds of dollars.  At that point, maybe you can't use a shared connection because you really need a dedicated T1.  The users should be given several months to lower their usage, but there is a point at which cable connections are shared and you might need a dedicated connection.  Rather than disconnect the user from service, the warnings could say that if the usage continues for several month, their bandwidth will be limited to 1Mbps (which would limit them to 316GB of transfer in a month) - essentially giving them a cheap T1.<p>It's never fun talking about limitations, but the world is made up of them.  Rather than fight the limitations, we could actually use them to create better technologies.  For example, most dedicated hosting providers give you unmetered bandwidth within their data center.  ISPs could likewise give you unmetered bandwidth within the scope of the central office you're connected to (and faster than your general internet connection).  We could then build P2P tools that would leverage such a system giving us faster downloads while using less resources.  Creative thinking and an understanding of the resources at hand will help us to create better things.  Ignoring resources and passing blame around just won't get us anywhere.",1232552306

While I'm not saying everyone in a top position of a profitable company has nothing new to say, there are people who are just hard-working, potentially well-connected and knew how to hack the system for financial gain. Would heiresses and lottery winners be excluded? Where would one draw the line? Ditto for math degrees, would you care what a Chemistry PhD trying to create better ways for oil companies to make money has to say? Who would decide what fields are ""worthy""? Is sociology okay? Is botology? Is computer science?<p>In my opinion, what made TED great is their dependence on the ideas <i>themselves</i>, and not credentials, to present to the world. The mix of people from all walks of life, from rural African villages, to dancers, to PhDs, to poets, to interns, to Nobel winners, to musicians, to Presidents (I can go on and on) is what made TED so great. Academic conferences existed before and will exist after, but very few will have the wide appeal and poignancy of TED.<p>Hoping that my comment above gets voted down is exactly the type of community I'm afraid of.

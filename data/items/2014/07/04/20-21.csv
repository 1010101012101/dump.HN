7990189,comment,7988738,7989808,2,0,nine_k,,,"I hate to ruin if for you, but usually Python is only a few hundred times slower than C++, typical Java is maybe 20% slower, and well-written Java is about as fast.",1404507507
7990188,comment,7988738,7990100,5,0,YZF,,,"Not every Python program is slower than C++ by a factor of 10000.  Some are.  Some Python can be reasonably fast as long as all the heavy lifting is done in native code, e.g. numpy or scipy.  Let&#x27;s say it would typically be more in the x250 range for algorithmic code that uses native Python types.  You get to the 10k range when you create your own types and do meta-programming and try to do algorithms over that. YMMV.<p>The point I was making though was that if you don&#x27;t care then you don&#x27;t care.  I wrote some Python for a friend who wanted to scrape and process financial information from various web sites.  I&#x27;d be an idiot to do that in C++.  None of us cared how long it took to run (as long as it wasn&#x27;t weeks).  Having access to various Python libraries made this task a breeze and maintainability wasn&#x27;t much of a concern either.<p>Andrei wouldn&#x27;t have made that statement about C++ vs. Java if the difference was in the noise.  I think x3-5 is a reasonable rough number to put on it but while I can point to benchmarks I can&#x27;t point to a comprehensive study that shows &quot;reasonably&quot; written across different domains.  You&#x27;re welcome to take those numbers with a grain of salt and do your own investigation.  Another data point there is that C++ is the dominant language in Google Code Jam and TopCoder SRMs where writing fast and correct code quickly is a competitive advantage.<p>EDIT: I find a lot of people will underestimate the performance advantage of native languages vs. JIT or interpreted environments.  The x10000 is something I&#x27;ve seen in a real world system.  Another thing to consider is that in a native language you can drop to assembler to optimize performance critical sections.  You have 100% absolute control over your hardware.

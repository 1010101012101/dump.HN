While scala boasts less verbosity than java I felt like the syntax became more complex than what I was accustomed to and slowed my progress if you can believe that.

2476565,comment,2473932,2476514,1,0,kragen,,,"I suspect that the killer feature of Tera-like architectures for embedded systems could be their determinism. Embedded microcontrollers like the LPC2100 series are starting to get caches, branch prediction, and the like, and that makes me really nervous, because it's going to make worst-case timing very hard to reproduce in testing.  (In a way, this has been the case since the introduction of interrupts in the 1960s, but I think it makes the problem much worse.)<p>If multithreaded or massively multicore processors were a viable alternative, you could get deterministic timings without sacrificing throughput.  You could even do away with interrupts.  The GreenArrays chip doesn't have interrupts at all; instead, its cores go into a low-power shutdown state whenever they're waiting on I/O.<p>But that's all pretty speculative.",1303550865

Apparently it got functions.<p>FORTRAN had user-defined functions since FORTRAN II in 1958; see <a href=""http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102653989.05.01.acc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/10...</a> on page numbers 5, 14, and 15.<p>Joel unfortunately completely misses the point of why C and Java suck at this stuff: you can use functions as values in them (anonymous inner classes in Java) but <i>they aren't closures</i>.  And his comment about automatically parallelizing ""map"" is a little off-base; if you take some random piece of code and stick it into a transparently parallel ""map"", you're very likely to discover that it isn't safe to run multiple copies of it concurrently, which is why languages like Erlang have a different name for the ""parallel map"" function.  The ""map"" in MapReduce is <i>inspired by</i> the function of that name in Lisp and other functional languages; it isn't a drop-in replacement for it.<p>As usual, while Joel's overall point is reasonably accurate, most of his supporting points are actually false to the point of being ignorant nonsense.

To be safe, discourage such activity. Instruct the community to post their own scripts or scripts they know to have been shared in the open - and then trust your community members to do the right thing. In a large community, you can't possibly police everything. So follow the YouTube example. If a developer or lawyer claims to own a script that one of your members is thought to have illegally posted, censor the file and inform the member. Ban repeat offenders.",1219373678

The second is very uniquely Russian (I only kind of get it) - somehow, vulgarity with a good comeback is funny. The third makes fun of overvaluing superficial social status (being in the aeroplane industry), which I could see as an internal stereotype of Jewish culture.",1219373407

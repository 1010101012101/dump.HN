167077,comment,166679,166679,0,0,neilc,,,"Who has a serious problem with being overloaded with Twitter traffic, Facebook invites and FriendFeed events? TC ""journalists"", other Valley denizens, and basically the existing Web 2.0 in-crowd. Is this a problem that real, ordinary people actually face when they try to use the Internet? I'm not convinced.<p>However, the broader point -- as the web matures, there will be a continual increase in the number of information sources, and therefore a need better tools to separate the signal from the noise -- is not novel; people have been remarking on this for years.<p>Sometimes I think a reasonable heuristic to reduce noise is to dismiss out of hand anything that begins with ""Web 3.0 will be about ..."".",1208508988

167075,comment,166856,166856,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I've thought about this before, and it's on my table-o-things-to-develop. The way to do it is with an inexpensive external piece of hardware that users will insert into their internet connection. It would have two ethernet interfaces, a clearly-labeled ""in"" and ""out"".<p>With OpenBSD and pf, you can set it up to act as a ""bump in the wire"", a bridging firewall that can't be hit from the outside but can still do traffic filtering.<p>Then, you set up a light http server that's only accessible from the local net, and patch in a variety of shell and python scripts to make the glue between pf and the http server.<p>The user can open a webpage and get a nice little graph of traffic with some simplified explanations, and can shape or filter traffic with a bit of clicking around.<p>I've built a couple of OpenBSD firewalls for a couple of local businesses (one of them is an ISP), as well as some of the sorts of shell scripts that would be needed. I've got a few other ideas for it that would make it an even more killer device, but don't wanna give away everything. :-)<p>The nice thing is, the hardware doesn't have to be very powerful at all. You could hit a pretty modest price point on the things and still be able to kick a fair bit of money back to the OpenBSD project. Everyone would be happy.",1208508832

167071,comment,166481,166481,0,0,willphipps,,,"This is a cool idea - but I think you definitely should have video.<p>If you could reach out to the stand up community and get them submitting videos it'd be cool - there are thousands of them as well, so filtering the good stuff is always tricky. Maybe you could tie your voting system into that.<p>If you are using wordpress I would recommend showinabox.tv -  it lets you easily add video to your blog and let people subscribe to it. I'd consider offering footage in HD or Hi-Resolution on Miro (www.getmiro.com) it's by far the best video rss aggregator. I think youtube videos are such poor quality they really don't do most videos justice, when there is an opportunity for people to watch them full screen in DVD quality.",1208508276

167069,comment,167032,167065,0,0,rms,,,"It's been close to six months since the most recent thread about kratom on this site. That was the second thread I ever submitted about kratom, and I submitted it in response to a ""coding while high"" post. It turned into an obnoxious flame war, I would rather that doesn't happen here.<p>As long as the discourse can stay reasonable, I don't understand why this thread would be treated differently than any other threads about someone's business. That's why this site exists. We're allowed to promote ourselves and I suspect that some people on this site may have the type of connection that I am looking to make here.<p>If you are not personally interested in this thread, I am sorry that I wasted some of your time.",1208507607
167068,comment,167032,167063,0,0,rms,,,"Kratom does make this list, alongside mostly illegal drugs. <a href=""http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/index.html</a> This list only matters in that people can cite it when talking about kratom; it has no power of its own. The DEA is doing absolutely nothing about kratom right now, though they could start lobbying if they wanted. The catalyst that is making salvia illegal is a kid that killed himself after smoking salvia. I am confident we will not see a similar catalyst for kratom.<p>Kratom is legal. The feds can't bust you for selling kratom in the way they can for selling medical marijuana. The FDA currently has jurisdiction over kratom and they would need to argue that it was medication being illegally prescribed, or that it was an unregistered nutritional supplement, or a food that wasn't a certified food.<p>I think a more likely problem is that medical marijuana dispensaries are doing just fine with their revenue streams and don't want to try anything new.",1208507299

167054,comment,166607,166607,0,0,danohuiginn,,,"""for high quality, sporadic writers, payment might mean more frequent writing.""<p>And more frequent writing might mean lower-quality writing. There are certainly writers I'd pay to write less - to get the same ideas not buried under so many words. If a magazine had its staff writers produce, say, a maximum 500 words a day, the quality would skyrocket and I'd pay much more for it. Look at the quality of the New Yorker - it's not because they have the best writers (although they do), it's because they let them work for months on a single piece.",1208505964

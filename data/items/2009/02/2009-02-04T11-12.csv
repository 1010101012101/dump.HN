465622,comment,464445,465060,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"It's interesting you would see it that way -- 'cause I'm an agile coach. I train CSMs and teams when they first start using agile/scrum techniques.<p>It's a simple thing, but people keep screwing it up. Say you have a two-week sprint. What can you do in two weeks? Make a list. Then go do that.<p>You don't have to break your list up into dozens of tiny tasks -- that's crazy. But that's exactly what some PMs and CSMs want the teams to do. Some consultants even require that everything be broken up into tasks of less than 4 hours.<p>If you do it that way, yes, it's micromangement hell. But the way it's supposed to work is just you describing and committing to doing some work in a certain amount of time, whether that's one huge story or a dozen little stories.<p>I encourage people doing it the first time to break their work up into little pieces, <i>if it helps them figure out what they need to do</i>, but even then I actively discourage the CSM from tracking at the micro-task level. There's simply no benefit.<p>Agile is a very simple philosophy with common sense practices. If you try hard enough, however, you can make your life miserable with it. Unfortunately, people try their hardest to remake it into some kind of micro-management, data-centric, ritual-based death grind. It's not supposed to be like that. Stand ups, like I said, can be coffee at 3 everyday with the team. Stories can be big. etc.<p>There is the aspect of holding programmers accountable, no doubt. But there's also the aspect of giving them the freedom to break up their work and execute it in any fashion they see fit. Companies focus on the first part and then forget about the second.",1233748378

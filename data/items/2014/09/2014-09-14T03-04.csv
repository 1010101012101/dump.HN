8314478,comment,8314188,8314188,2,0,Xcelerate,,,"> The authors discovered that people whose water had the least amount of lithium had significantly greater levels of suicide, homicide and rape than the people whose water had the higher levels of lithium. The group whose water had the highest lithium level had nearly 40 percent fewer suicides than that with the lowest lithium level.<p>I can&#x27;t but help wonder whether higher levels of lithium also correlate with a clean water supply, which would indicate a more affluent community.  It may simply be the case that those areas with cleaner water have a better economy, and thus less crime, etc.  Although lithium undoubtedly has antidepressant effects.<p>It&#x27;s funny this article popped up on here.  Today I was actually reading about how chromium picolinate was found to have a positive effect on those with atypical depression.  It can be purchased from any vitamin store.  It makes me wonder if trace elements (lithium, chromium, etc.) are vital to the brain&#x27;s proper functioning via some as yet undiscovered mechanism.<p>Also, why is it that you have to have a prescription to get certain compounds, but other ones you can just purchase yourself?  Is it simply the potential for toxicity?",1410666943

8314476,comment,8313137,8314294,2,0,StillBored,,,"I&#x27;m going to second the price on mountain bikes.<p>I picked up my first &quot;real&quot; (not a department store bike) mountain bike, a giant NRS XTC, in 2000. That bike cost me $1800 which I thought was outrageous. But, it was basically a top of the line giant at the time, complete with nearly the best components money could buy.<p>I rode it weekly for a decade on trails designed to destroy bikes. I replaced it with a lower mid-range trek superfly fs a couple years ago. That bike cost me nearly $4k. And besides the 29&quot; upgrade (which makes it weigh more) I&#x27;m not convinced its actually a better bike. For sure, the more expensive versions (which were pushing $10k for the carbon versions) weren&#x27;t a better ride.<p>So, I agree the prices for mountain bikes are ridiculous, especially if you don&#x27;t buy into the idea that there has been a lot of technology progression since the late &#x27;90s early 20s. Most of the &quot;progression&quot; seems to be more style than substance. Take the recent axle/skewer fiasco. The general claim was that the skewer was a problem so it needed upgrading, but who has actually had a problem with them? Absolutely no one I know, has ever had a wheel come out of a front fork unless they failed to tighten it. Nor do I buy the idea that its more stable because the skewer wasn&#x27;t providing any rigidity to the front fork, that was the job of the axle (which if you notice is the part that makes contact with the fork for all directional forces except laterally). In the lateral case fork manufactures were putting locking indentations in forks since the early 90&#x27;s. Further unnecessarily changes, 27.5&quot; wheels, nonstandard head tubes, etc.<p>The lack of _ANY_ competition in &quot;local bike shop&quot; sales channels due to franchise licenses and regional restrictions also serve to easily quadruple the prices too.<p>Bottom line is that I agree. Buy a used bike if you can. I&#x27;m pretty particular about size/fit so its harder for me, but people who are closer to average size don&#x27;t really have an excuse.",1410666824

8314474,comment,8314013,8314154,1,0,djokkataja,,,"I&#x27;ve had a similar experience; I&#x27;ve worked and volunteered with several nonprofit organizations, and I&#x27;ve worked for several for-profit companies (not startups), and the nonprofits were dazzlingly inefficient by comparison. The executives in the nonprofits were pretty driven and at least somewhat visionary, but average nonprofit employee seemed less competent than the average for-profit employee to me.<p>Dug around to see if I could find studies about this--most seemed to be about the beneficial effects (if any) of profit-sharing. The closest I came was this survey of hospital workers (<a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/7042/ForProfit-vs-NotforProfit-Two-Paths-Same-Outcome.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/7042/ForProfit-vs-NotforProfit-Tw...</a>). Very roughly, it suggests that for-profit employees may be slightly more committed to doing quality work if the difference found in the survey is actually significant. Besides that, work at not-for-profits seems to be significantly more humane based on the responses. Unfortunately it&#x27;s only about hospital employees and doesn&#x27;t specify the sample size or the methodology.",1410666780

We&#x27;ve built a content publishing platform to inspire our community as well as a forum network for women to publicly or anonymously crowd source career advice.<p>Glassbreakers is focused on solving the problem of gender disparity in the global work force. Our platform is gender gated to insure women in business will have a safe place on the Internet to talk about work.

8314414,comment,8311127,8312618,2,0,glenra,,,"> <i>my wife who spent the best part of a decade dealing with drug addicts.</i><p>Here&#x27;s the problem with the experience of your wife (or anyone in medicine): <i>selection bias</i>. She only sees drug users whose use is a <i>problem</i>.<p>Even if positive drug experiences outnumbered negative ones ten-to-one, a hundred-to-one or even a million-to-one your wife would still have the same subjective impression: that all the drug users <i>she</i> sees are people who can&#x27;t handle it. Same thing with the police officers. If somebody does drugs a few times and finds it a positive life experience, they probably don&#x27;t go to a hospital or deal with cops.<p>Steve Jobs claimed taking LSD was one of the most important experiences in his life - he took it a dozen or so times (and smoked pot weekly for about 5 years). Many other people have made major creative breakthroughs or used these drugs to successfully deal with PTSD or depression. <i>There is an upside</i>. Your wife&#x27;s experience by its very nature will never encounter that upside. So what she tells you is data, but not <i>definitive</i> data. You need to put it in a larger context to reach conclusions...which is where large-scale studies, Portugal and the rest comes in.",1410664663

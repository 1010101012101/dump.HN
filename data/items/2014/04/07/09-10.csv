Often, I&#x27;ll try to teach someone something, and I&#x27;ll know for sure that they can and will grasp a concept, but they&#x27;ll just stop short on their own accord, chalking failure up to their own (imagined) inherent inability rather than a specific situational lack of something. Usually accompanied with a general statement like &quot;I&#x27;m just not a technical person&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m not that smart&quot; (sometimes not voiced) or &quot;I don&#x27;t get math&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m more of a right-brain person&quot;. It&#x27;s interesting that of the tons of much likelier reasons for failure (bad teaching, not enough practice, not having the right foundation), the most commonly chosen is &quot;it&#x27;s me&quot;.<p>The opposite side to this is to incorporate failure and retrial as part of the learning process, and to realize that the failure is a specific situation and mostly not a general statement of ability.<p>Anyway, when they&#x27;re encouraged a bit and they do succeed, their surprise and satisfaction is one of my favourite things in the world.<p>- Psychology is not bullshit like I used to think before.<p>- Introspection and self-examination is very important and ignoring your inner world does not make your problems go away. Regularly taking time to consider your thoughts, worries, knee-jerk reactions, big life events, priorities is a great idea, and keeps problems from bottling up. A multitude of lingering things on your mind that don&#x27;t seem immediate on their own can add up fast. I didn&#x27;t even know this could happen until it did to me.<p>As a positive result though, I discovered a whole new meta-level of thought. Observing the process through which thoughts materialize in my mind is enlightening. Watching chains of thought develop step by step uncovers biases and thought-tendencies that are often unconscious but can be damaging.<p>It also promotes self-honesty, which sometimes saves you a lot of time and money and is often a great antidote to ignorance. There isn&#x27;t a switch you can flip to be more objective but a decent attempt helps.<p>- When people say things, don&#x27;t forget to think about <i>why</i> they&#x27;re saying them. Often this provides valuable perspective. What&#x27;s motivating them to say that? Is it conscious? Sometimes a pipe is a pipe, but sometimes it&#x27;s not. For example, if someone tells you &quot;never trust women&quot;, concluding that the person has probably been severely hurt by women before (conclusion from asking why the person said this) is much more valuable than concluding women are evil (the direct conclusion).",1396864797
7545564,comment,7545456,7545456,1,0,stdbrouw,,,"Love it. I&#x27;ve been making my presentations in InDesign for a while now, and exporting to PDF, and while the end result always looks great, I end up spending an inordinate amount of time choosing the typeface and the look and feel. Turning a Markdown document into a presentation by simply selecting a theme and a color scheme sounds wonderful to me, especially considering the themes are high quality.<p>One thing that&#x27;s not entirely clear, though, is how the automatic layout works. For example, does it colorize photos to match the color scheme? What if you don&#x27;t want it to? How does it resize photos when it needs to? Is text size based on the amount of text in a slide? Is it fully automatic or can some things be tweaked manually? I&#x27;m guessing this stuff has been thought through pretty well, but OTOH &quot;it automatically makes things look pretty&quot; does sound a little bit too good to be true.",1396864752

But just in case you are not, my experience with Oracle is quite the opposite of what you describe.  Oracle is sold on the golf course, and they exist purely for profit.  Most Oracle consultants I know (quite a few) who actually develop software using the tools, gladly admit they work with Oracle because they can charge high fees.  In fact, if I asked them their opinion on this specific incident they might actually approve - given the end result is that their knowledge is safe from newcomers.<p>All this is anecdotal of course - but this is a good talk that gives a pretty nice perspective on the whole thing: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&feature=player_detailpage#t=2136s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&feature=player_de...</a>",1396864514

Then I will.  It&#x27;ll be great, and then I&#x27;ll have sorted the problems that exist within the context of my little environment over which I have control, and everything will be going 2-3 times better, but then i become bored again...

As far as I can see, there&#x27;s three possible models:<p>1) PAYG: you get an invoice monthly which lists what you&#x27;ve used, and you pay it. Can also do pre-pay (Tarsnap, AWS)\n2) Tiered pricing: you pick a tier, and pay a fixed amount every month that gives you a usage limit. (Github)\n3) Tiered-As-You-Go: a bit of a blend of the two, it&#x27;s like PAYG but the usage billable &#x27;units&#x27; are fairly chunky, so you get a mostly consistent bill but with the flexibility to use more on-demand.<p>I&#x27;ve read a fair bit about why pricing tiers make a lot of sense from the business side. There&#x27;s lots of stuff around psychology and maximizing profit out of each customer and that all seems to make sense. However, I can&#x27;t get away from the fact that as a consumer, I <i>hate</i> tiered pricing. I usually end up feeling that I&#x27;m being ripped off, unless I use everything that my current tier offers. The tiers hardly ever fit my needs, and it&#x27;s generally not a nice feeling. And once I do get to the limit of my tier, the next small thing that I need equates to a big jump in cost, because suddenly I need to be a super-platinum customer, even though I don&#x27;t need most of what that offers.<p>So my question is this: If you were building a startup now, what factors would influence your pricing model? Is there anything that would make you rule out PAYG or pricing tiers completely?",1396862919

The gnunet is very similar to what bitcloud would like to be, and it already exists for something like 10 years. Bitcloud.. is just a fantasy at this point. And i2p also works similarly. In i2p you need to have shared some bandwidth in order to get higher speeds. And there is also Tor, which runs on altruism. \nBitcloud is just trying to attach mining and coin like properties to something that doesn&#x27;t need it. If you want to add incentivesed routing, why not fork one of these projects and add it in? Lastly, there is no idea yet from the bitcloud community on how to securely add and integrate incentivesed routing.",1396861502

But never is it a good idea to map the db operations directly to the rest urls, so much more has to happen in production.<p>The public api layer is sometimes mapped more manual as auto generation rest apis rarely aren&#x27;t leaky abstractions. ORMs, data layers, authentication etc behind the scenes may be generated or flexible to change.<p>Public apis might even have public objects that aren&#x27;t objects from the database in full or at all i.e. meta/tracking fields, private info.<p>Public apis offer multiple levels of service: direct data/json, mvvm views, tools, syncing, per-view state (multiple objects), authentication etc. The term REST has colluded it a bit but ultimately REST is representational state transfer, it doesn&#x27;t have to be web to db without an application layer.<p>An API is a public definition that should be as concrete as possible for the service use cases and public apis provide a flexible abstraction to expose a service to other consumers. So I will keep writing my public apis, I&#x27;ll generate boilerplate behind that but I won&#x27;t be locked to any implementation other than a uniquely designed api for my service, features needed and use case.",1396861311

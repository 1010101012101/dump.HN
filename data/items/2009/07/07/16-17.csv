Drupal has come a lot further in this process that Joomla has, which means that today it's closer to be a general purpose framework. It still holds some of its heritage, so you'll probably find it somewhere in between Joomla and RoR. That's not a bad thing, if what you're building is some kind of cms.<p>Compared to other general purpose frameworks, Drupal has a lot of stuff out-of-the-box, and it's quite easy to get in to. The community has been gaining a lot of followers recently and in some areas it is becoming the cms of choice for larger businesses. It's especially popular in the news paper world.<p>Judging from my observations, I would say that Drupal is a much more mature system that Joomla is (although I must admit I have limited experience with Joomla). I think they are about equal in how easy they are to learn. Both of them are fairly low-tech, procedural systems. I would pick Drupal of the two.",1246985273

This was a while back, before they even announced Simple Pay or broke the API doc up into N separate docs.  Man, that's irritating.<p>It just irritates me that pretty much <i>everything</i> has to be done via the API.  Like I said, 5-10% of our transactions fail, meaning like 1 or 2 a week.  If I could inspect the error and handle it from the console it would be much simpler than writing a ton more code for it.  FPS-related code is brittle and takes a long time to test, since there are so many error/failure conditions to account for.<p>Sure, manually handling everything doesn't scale, but I'll deal with that when we're processing 1000s of payments instead of 10s.<p>Plus, I think it's pretty ridiculous that they won't give out the reason why it failed.  Sure, I can write some more code to query the transaction status and error messages, but that means <i>more code</i>  That's what I've found with FPS.

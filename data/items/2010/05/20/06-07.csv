As an aggregate, the head shops pay too much for their wholesale kratom.<p>For anyone that didn't get the reference, my primary business at this point is selling legal drugs (sometimes known as ""herbal medicine"" depending on the conversational context). My website is <a href=""http://getkratom.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getkratom.com</a> and in the early days of Hacker News (Startup News?) I started an enormous flame war while trying to start a discussion about my business. I have since tried to stop mentioning it here, though I certainly don't mind talking about it to anyone that may be interested.",1274338575

This list is really pretty darn awful.<p>My biggest issue with python is its stupid tendency toward imperative programming in the standard library. For an instance of this irritation, try running python, then executing dir(<any object you pick>). Then, try dir(<obj>).sort . Notice anything? Yeah, the f'er sorted it in place, and didn't return anything. Nice job, library.<p>I once tweeted that python was a c programmers version of lisp, and ruby is a lisp programmers version of c, and the more time I spend working with both languages, the more I am convinced of the truthfulness of this statement.",1274338274

However, it makes sense if you know pythons module loding mechanisms:<p>The function definition is a statement which is evaluated at module load time, and it registers the foo-function in the module namespace. During creating the foo-function, the default-parameters are evaluated (resulting in a single list instance), and the results of this evaluation are used as default parameters in the following. That is also why something like def foo(x = random_value()) is kind of tricky and should be documented.",1274337814

You can overwrite the Referrer header in XMLHttpRequest<p>4) Preload the images BEFORE the search is done (ie, on the search page).

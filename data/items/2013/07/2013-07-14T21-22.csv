If investors/etc. give you flak, tell them that your customers need this anyway, and at least your getting paid for the trouble.  FYI I&#x27;m doing this now: many of our customers are young companies that need advice, and instead of taking an hour+ to give it free, we take a few hours and charge them.  The actual work can be delivered by a number of people, so it scales fine.<p>adam

A scenario where you could be paid to donate 1% of your CPU time while certain webpages were open will never occur. Here&#x27;s why:<p>Let&#x27;s say there exists a problem where it&#x27;s worth paying to solve it like this. The most a company could pay you is just below the spot price for buying instances on EC2 or some other cloud/cluster -- or they&#x27;d do that instead. So we&#x27;re talking about nickels and dimes per hour for the equivalent of 100% CPU time on an EC2 instance.<p>If you donate the equivalent to 1% of that computational power, the most you can earn is hundredths of a penny per hour.

6042397,comment,6041316,6041316,3,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"I think &quot;stop writing code&quot; is decent advice in principle, but is practically difficult. A few points:<p>1. If you have no domain experience or expertise, you shouldn&#x27;t just stop writing code, you should stop what you&#x27;re doing. A lot of startups fail before any code is written because the founders know little to nothing about the market or industry they&#x27;re targeting.<p>2. While it is absolutely possible to sell software before it has been written, unless you&#x27;re well-connected and have trusted relationships that will deliver customers on tap, to get meaningful conversations started, you will often need to have <i>something</i> to show, even if it&#x27;s mockups or a basic prototype.<p>3. A lot of startups write <i>too much code</i> because they try to support use cases that they think are important. Ironically, some of these use cases are actually discovered through conversations with potential customers, which highlights the fact that it&#x27;s not simply enough to talk to people you hope might become your customers; you need to know <i>how</i> to talk to them.",1373838636

A company that offered to solve your distributed problems using distributed JavaScript could only charge as much as the spot price of buying EC2 instances. Otherwise, you&#x27;d just buy the EC2 instances and solve it there. A problem not amenable to solving with temporary machines wouldn&#x27;t be amenable to solving with times slices of JavaScript running on webpages.<p>It would take millions of page views to get the CPU-time equivalent of an hour running compiled code on an EC2 instance. That means the eCPMs the company could reasonably charge, or pay its publishers hosting the code, are thousands of times less than they earn from advertising.<p>(b) It&#x27;s a net negative for the economy. Distributing work through JavaScript on webpages is an involuntary donation from employers/schools moreso than the person behind the computer. That extra expense with no gain for the business/school has to be made up somewhere -- higher prices or lower wages/employment.<p>(c) It&#x27;s a net negative for the environment.

Nobody ever claimed that Martin was aggressive because he was black. 
The racism charge is pure bullshit. It is a fallacy to claim that it is always racist to say some particular black man is violent, because it &quot;implies the stereotype&quot;. Well, some people are violent, and some black people are too - and the question was not whether Martin was black and thus violent (it is obvious he&#x27;s black but that says nothing of him being violent) but whether Martin was violent regardless of him being black. And the data in the phone <i>was</i> relevant to that. Exactly <i>because</i> it is not imply that Martin was violent just from him being black, we need some evidence beyond that to figure out if he was - and the phone data <i>is</i> that evidence.",1373837930

Any encryption system with variable time encryption is useless unless you can somehow quantize it safely.<p>2. Eliminating covert channels is very nearly impossible. The literature on this goes way back, and it&#x27;s ugly.<p>Should most users defend against these attacks? The timing attacks, yes. But I would assert that if a hardware encryption module <i>appears</i> to operate in constant time, most users should trust it. But as always, it depends on your threat model.<p>For something like a serious credit card vault, I still think your best bet is to get it off the network, build and audit a custom protocol that only passes a known set of messages, rate limit those messages, and quantize message timings. At that point, your biggest problems are bribery, insiders and physical security.<p>But if you do all that, I can&#x27;t imagine why you would want to generate your encryption keys using somebody else&#x27;s black-box hardware. Entropy pools are a good idea, even if you decide to trust your hardware AES implementation.<p>(And yes, I&#x27;m still oversimplifying. Hacker News is no substitute for a real threat analysis and security audit, nor for a conversation with whoever regulates or insures your business.)",1373836701

It&#x27;s one thing saying chess club president initiated the violence and other thing saying seasoned MMA fighter initiated it (yes, I am purposely stereotyping here) - people differ with their relation to violence and how ready are they to participate in it, and evidence helps forming opinion about particular person&#x27;s relation to violence. That alone would not prove or disprove it, but would be relevant and not on the prosecution&#x27;s side.<p>Moreover, Angela Corey specifically claimed the prosecution does not have to disclose such evidence until the actual trial and can submit affidavit of probable cause based on half-truths, like it&#x27;s some kind of poker game. Looks like she went further and did not disclose some of the information even after the trial started, which is clearly against the law. Moreover, if the verdict were different, it would most probably be a base for an appeal and good chance for the verdict to be thrown out due to prosecutorial misconduct and possibly another trial arranged, at great cost to both taxpayers and all participants.

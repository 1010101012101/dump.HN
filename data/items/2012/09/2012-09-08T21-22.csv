(See, for example, the cleanup instructions at the bottom of this page: <a href=""http://www.epa.state.il.us/mercury/compact-fluorescent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epa.state.il.us/mercury/compact-fluorescent.html</a>)<p>I'd guess that a large percentage of people who buy CFLs are totally unaware of how to deal with these hazards (or are even unaware that the bulbs contain poisonous material).<p>Also, the rise in the use of CFLs means that more people will be exposed to mercury while mining it and while assembling the lamps (probably in places like China, where occupational health laws are fairly lax).",1347141575

I re-read the article looking for clear evidence, and what I saw on close read was weasel-wording: when direct health effects are being talked about, the subject of the sentence becomes ""flame retardants"" rather than a specific chemical; when lax investigations become a topic, it's the EPA's laxity (the EPA isn't solely responsible for evaluating chemicals).<p>The closest the author comes to accusing a specific flame retarded is chlorinated trisphosphates.

Because the Conservapedia people were unhappy with the editorial policy and they wanted to fork it. And the CC license made it possible for them.<p>> If Wikipedia's text were not freely redistributable, there'd be other ways of ""forking"" it [...] for example distribute a browser extension<p>That would be of no use if the person's complaint were that it was online and they wanted to print it out on paper. Or if their complaint were that it was only available on the internet and they wanted it to also be available on the private military security network. Or if their complaint were that the board had decided to block access in certain countries because of laws passed on those countries that imposed liability risks. CC licensing addresses ALL of these concerns. It's also technologically easier for someone like Conservapedia to simply seed another MediaWiki clone with the same data than it is for them to create some kind of browser plugin that transforms pages and then convince their audience to use it. I, for example, would NEVER install a browser plugin created by Conservapedia, but I do sometimes browse their site (mostly just to laugh at them).<p>> the most compelling actual development you can point to in support of them is Conservapedia (which [...] does not get enough traffic to count as a significant effect [...]).<p>First of all, who are YOU to say that Conservapedia doesn't count? Even if they only have 6 users, aren't those 6 users entitled to their own opinion? I want to support that!<p>Secondly, I can give other examples. The work I'm taking a break from at this very moment is editing a patent application. The lawyers who constructed the text appear to have borrowed many explanations of basic technology from the corresponding Wikipedia entries. This would be illegal without the CC license, but I maintain that it is a good thing.<p>Yes, SEO spammers who just copy from Wikipedia are bad. They're not contributing anything new. But the solution is NOT to prohibit anyone anywhere from copying from Wikipedia, instead the solution is for Google to discount sources significantly when a substantial portion of the text is identical to text in Wikipedia and Wikipedia does not contain a link to the site in question (which it would if the copying had gone the other way).",1347140887

Every day millions of individuals make millions of choices, so every day the culture is changing in little ways.

It's harder to make people care, and the target audience is much more diverse.

We're discussing subpoenas, not actual searches.<p>A subpoena is part of pre-trial discovery. It's similar in spirit to what a lawyer can compel your company to produce if you're targeted in a civil suit. Any lawyer can get a court clerk to issue a subpoena for an open case. The target of the subpoena has recourse: challenge the subpoena in court.<p>I see clearly the concern about criminal law enforcement agencies casting too wide a net by relying on ""relevance to investigation"" instead of ""probable cause"". But the Wired story makes it seem like the biggest problem with administrative subpoenas is that they're extrajudicial. It's obviously the case that judges are going to tend to side with the government in these cases --- not because they're in cahoots, but because in the overwhelming majority (<i>not ALL of the cases, just the majority</i>), the government is (a) not abusing process, and (b) acting in the clear service of the public good.<p>There's no such thing as an ""extrajudicial subpoena"", is there?",1347140169

Have you ever been to Hong Kong? Do you speak Chinese? I have been following the news on political and educational developments in Hong Kong since the 1970s, when I began my study of (standard) Chinese and Cantonese, and have especially followed news from Hong Kong from multiple sources since the first time I traveled to Hong Kong in 1982. People in Hong Kong have a legitimate, grave concern that the central government of the P.R.C. will restrict the freedom of people living in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. One of the reasons that few people in Taiwan support ""reunification"" on P.R.C. terms is that many people in Taiwan are well traveled in the P.R.C. proper and in Hong Kong, and know that they enjoy more freedom under their independent government.<p>As Confucius said, in one of his most famous take-downs, ""At first in dealing with people, I would hear their words and trust their deeds, but now my way of dealing with people is to hear their words and observe their deeds."" Maybe the P.R.C. regime mostly has benign intentions toward Hong Kong, which is part of its national territory since retrocession from Britain in 1997. But retrocession has not been all upside for the people of Hong Kong, and they ought to be the people who decide what policy trade-offs they desire to live under. Action speaks louder than words, and people close to the action speak more persuasively to me than armchair observers in the United States.<p>AFTER EDIT: Responding to the kind reply, I have to strenuously disagree that what goes on in the United States, where most but not all primary schools are operated by (local units of) the government, and where government officials from time to time issue press releases to a free press with no prior restraint on publication, is in any way comparable to the situation in China, where all primary schools are tightly regulated by the national central government, there is no free press and much prior restraint of all publications, and where the ruling party has never subjected itself to the discipline of free and fair elections.<p>The term ""brainwashing"" originated in Chinese ("""") and was used without irony by Communist Party of China political cadres in the leadership echelons of the Chinese armed forces fighting in Korea to describe practices of torture to influence the ideology of captured Korean and United Nations P.O.W.s. The current news about the situation in Hong Kong includes the background that people in Hong Kong objected to new textbooks slanted to support the Party as ""brainwashing,""<p><a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/09/07/hong-kong-education-china.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/09/07/hong-kong-educ...</a><p>and then a pro-Beijing leader of an NGO said ""A brain needs washing if there is a problem, just as clothes need washing if they're dirty and a kidney needs washing if it's sick."" That statement by Jiang Yudui, chairman of the China Civic Education Promotion Association of Hong Kong (essentially a CPC front organization) further alarmed residents of Hong Kong.<p>So, no, I respectfully submit that you are comparing apples to stones, and have made an inapt suggestion in the comment to which I first replied here. Again, I base my point of view on this issue on actual overseas residence in the Chinese-speaking world, including time in Hong Kong speaking to people who were born and who grew up there.",1347140046

No issue there.<p>I just feel that almost every nation on this planet is enslaved, in some way, by its own government --whether put into place by the people, by force or inheritance (royals).<p>I happen to think that most people on this planet are good people and that most of us want pretty much the same things: To live a good and peaceful life, have a family, provide for them and do the things we enjoy doing.<p>Governments, on the other hand, are all about power and control.  And they, invariably, take liberties that we, the people, might not want to take.  They get us into wars and conflicts, they enslave people, they engage in genocide and they create antagonisms that might not exist.<p>I am not so naive as to not understand that some people will behave badly.  History is full of these examples.<p>You take a country like China.  Over a billion people. And a few dozen (or less) call the shots?  Why?<p>Take the United States.  Do you realize that you can never really own your home here?  Why?  Property taxes.  That's why.  If you don't pay them the government can take your home away from you, even if you paid all loans and have no debt.  Why is our government entitled to tax our homes?  And why are they entitled to take our homes away?  If you really think about it and make an effort to clear your mind of any preconceived notions or indoctrination it becomes clear that this is but one example of the lunacy that government has become.<p>I think that humanity needs to evolve away from these systems if we are going to survive and thrive.

Particularly, most televisions and computer monitors are encased in a plastic housing which by law must be resistant to catching fire, and the universal way that is achieved is by mixing flame retardants with the plastic while the plastic is still ""liquid"". I read once that flame retardants make up up to 20% of the volume of the material of the housings.<p>When you remove this toxic plastic housing, there is another housing underneath made of steel, which holds the monitor or TV together just fine on its own.  The exception is the buttons for adjusting brightness, etc.<p>Last year, I removed <i>all</i> the urethane foam from my home and the plastic housing from my monitor.  There is a row of buttons for brightness, etc, that now hangs by wires, and there is a button near the top of the monitor for power which now hangs down the back of the monitor by wires.  Now that the buttons are no longer held in place by the plastic housing, it is much harder to press them, but that is OK because I never adjust the brightness (preferring to use OS X to ""switch black and white"" at night). And I never use the power button.  (The monitor draws one watt when it is on but not receiving video input).<p>Except for the small and not particularly noticeable row of buttons hanging by wires from the bottom of the monitor, the monitor has a tidy, trim appearance and does not prevent me from feeling proud of how my computer looks.<p>I recommend these home modifications to almost everybody.<p>The way the flame retardants get into the human body, by the way, is by attaching to dust, which gets ingested in small amounts.

It's more likely you came to them after a lifetime of exposure to a press and public educational system that almost uniformly espouses such views.<p>As a thought experiment, consider what a hoplite educated in a Spartan <i>agoge</i> would think of your views. What about an aristocrat educated in Antonine Rome, or in France under Louis XIV? Would they share your sanguine views on the wisdom of the People? If not, why not? How confident are you that you are right and they are wrong, and what is the basis of that confidence?<p>None of this is a defense of current Chinese government policy. My point is that using official education for brainwashing and political indoctrination is par for the course in a country founded on the principle of popular sovereignty. One consequence of this is that virtually every educated Westerner, including most readers of Hacker News and the <i>New York Times</i>, has been exposed to the same sort of brainwashing and political indoctrination decried by the protesters in the OP. One effect of this is a reflexive support of popular movements of all sorts without an appreciation of the potential costs of that support.<p>Louis XIV might even have been sanguine, but his descendant Louis XVI would know what I mean.",1347138085

Even if you change that to ""users"" instead of ""people,"" since so many twitter accounts are robots - even then, 100 users on average for every tweet is ABSURD.<p>> the polling that twitter applications do even when there are no new tweets<p>Polling with no new tweets is <i>far</i> easier to optimize than polling when there are tweets. So just discount this almost entirely in your roughshod analysis.<p>> spam filtering<p>Have you been on twitter? We all get spam and see fake accounts trying to get at us regularly. Try mentioning you're on a diet on twitter and see how many followers you rack up. If they're filtering spam, they're not filtering it well, so I hope they aren't burning too much cash on it.<p>> API servers<p>API servers are frontends that use dramatically fewer resources than the work the backends have to do.

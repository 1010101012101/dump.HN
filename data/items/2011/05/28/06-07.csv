2594053,comment,2593095,2593095,2,0,sb,,,"I have just read the post and have to say that I would appreciate the post containing a more accurate description of the testing methodology. Some of the techniques described are known in interpreter optimization and his description of ""threaded code"" intepreter is actually not consistent with what it usually means (viz. threaded code interpreters have nothing to do with ""threading"" the decode for the successor instruction into the operation implementation of the current instruction, but just moving instruction decode and dispatch into the operation implementation.)<p>Aside of that, there have been papers detailing the software pipelining approach (cf. Hoogerbrugge et al.: ""A code compression system based on pipelined interpreters"", 1999), but I cannot for the love of god imagine that the loop shown in there is faster than a JIT compiler for a very simple reason: each of the interpreter operations is invoked via a function pointer, which means that the compiler emits an indirect branch instruction for implementing this. Now, these indirect branch instructions are <i>very</i> costly, and a simple JIT compiler could just take the actual values (callee target addresses) of the input program and generate direct call instructions instead. (And I am not even talking about inlining the function bodies of the operation implementation.)",1306564943
2594052,comment,2591845,2593951,1,0,wvenable,,,"> Why couldn't they reuse the same resolution operator for all three, even if it's not the period character?<p>It may have been possible to do that when the language was originally designed but PHP has taking the long road to getting real OOP.  PHP3 had objects but no inheritance; they were really just structs with functions.  PHP4 added a lot more ability but, for reasons of compatibility, left a few things unchanged that should have been changed.  PHP5 fixed most of those remaining issues and continues to add more features with every release.  PHP wasn't designed all at once and things were added as developers demanded them.  It was just supposed to be a procedural languages like ASP/VBScript but as a mix of C and Perl; all this object oriented stuff wasn't in the original plan.  It now has namespaces and exceptions and all kinds of things that nobody imagined it would ever have.  So they can't use one operator for all because each operation compiles down to something different (each from a different time) and that difference needs to be known at compile time without the benefit of knowing what the symbols resolve to.<p>> Other people -- who probably use and enjoy other languages -- raise issues with PHP that point at poor design.<p>This is a poor argument.  I use and enjoy many other languages.  In fact, I'm hardly doing any PHP development right now but I've got half-completed side project I'd like to finish.  There's no argument: PHP has a poor design.  But if you put things in the context of history, there is reason for that poor design.<p>> Then you respond with a rationale for why the well-designed thing couldn't be done.<p>I'm just stating the facts.  In this case, it's not like they're going out of the way to be difficult but they have to work with what they have.  If you have a time machine we could solve this once and for all.<p>> that doesn't make it a good decision in retrospect.<p>Of course, but hindsight is always 20/20.  Perhaps Python should have had unicode to start with and should have never made print a statement instead of a function.  Perhaps templates were not the best way to add generics to C++.  See, we can play this game all night.<p>> Do you mean that other languages can be compiled to PHP more easily? Because I have never heard this rationalization before.<p>Yes.  That rationalization was one of the reasons for adding it although more in the context of targeting parser generators (like lexx and yacc) to PHP.  Even Dijkstra didn't think that goto should been banished from all languages forever.",1306564892

For example, all numeric JavaScript and Python benchmarks can be heavily optimized by JIT compilers (essentially removing all of their interpreters' weaknesses: (un-)boxing, dynamic typing, and in the case of Python, reference counting; plus removing the interpreter overhead [i.e., instruction dispatching]). Many of the benchmarks are numerical in nature, too, even if the actual workload is usually non-numerical. So it might very well be that your actual workload does not use any of the fancy numerical operations that a JIT can optimize heavily. In such a case, the additional memory consumption of the code caches and the additional memory requirements of a generational garbage collector may in fact not give you any practical speedups in comparison to a sophisticated interpreter using just reference counting (which is known to be very space efficient).<p>Aside of this unfair skewing of benchmarks towards numerical computations, there are other points to consider in the discussion of JIT vs. interpreters, such as energy consumption. Does a programming language implementation using a JIT subsystem require more or less memory than an interpreter? (I am positive that some companies have already measured this, but there are AFAIK no publications concerning this important question.)<p>Summing up, I think--as is so often the case in computer science--which of the two techniques give the best results depends heavily on a) what trade-offs you/your customers are willing to make [space vs. time] and b) the actual performance is of your workload [numerical vs. non-numerical].",1306562886
2594017,comment,2593578,2593920,2,0,davidhollander,,,"> Unfortunately, Lua has statement- rather than expression-oriented semantics (i.e., no ""implicit returns"").<p>This is largely irrelevant for anything related to developing asynchronous services such as web or servers. Asynchronous web development using callbacks is a form of continuation passing style, where control is often explicitly passed using a callback. Since you are explicitly passing control, you usually never have to return values anyway. The 'return' keyword just becomes a bonus feature for convenient error handling.<p>Having a language with good closure support just works phenomenally well for asynchronous web development. For instance, sending an entire message asynchronously can be a pain because it can fail at any point in the message and require restarting at that point and keeping track of when it has finished.<p>It's a piece of cake in Lua though, due to its excellent support for closures:<p><pre><code>    -- SendAll\n    -- Start sending a message on connection [c]\n    -- Close when done.\n    function SendAll(c, msg)\n      local n=0\n      OnWrite(c, function(c)\n        n=n + c.fd:send(msg, n)\n        if n>=#msg then\n          c.fd:close()\n          return 'close' -- just for kicks\n        end\n      end)\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThe variable ""n"" is a counter for the number of bytes sent to the file descriptor ""fd"". The write callback lambda assigned with OnWrite can always access the appropriate counter ""n"" based on its creation location. No extra work was needed to create the closure, unlike in languages such as JavaScript.",1306562781

I also understand that the company is pretty inundated with response that they've had.<p>However, I can personally keep up with the number of bug reports. Most of them go unnoticed. Unfortunately, it seems like only the absolute giants (the entire platform being down, for instance) and a few random ones get attention at all. For example, two major incomplete parts of the platform: support for the Info tab, which was planned, seems like it was just abandoned. How long has the ""new"" Facebook been out? Another major recent one -- businesses can sign up for accounts without creating a profile. This special business account can manage a business Page, but that's it. Unfortunately, _no_ applications work with these new ""business accounts"" because the platform basically doesn't validate this type of user. I get messages about this on a daily basis, and I run just one application. I've been in touch with the Senior Platform Manager and the Platform Program Manager, but nothing has changed.<p>I can also say, more importantly, that there are regularly problems with it in general. Like what has been mentioned here already, things break at random, unannounced times. I've noticed that other, announced changes have been given too little notice for developers to keep up. And most frustratingly, when you start building on a buggy and incomplete platform, you can often spend copious amounts of time trying to find a bug in your code, only to find out that the bug is in fact Facebook's. I'm sure that any of the active developers in the community will tell you the best piece of advice -- when there's a problem with your app, always assume it's Facebook's fault first.<p>And it's tough dealing with a problem when it's out of your hands. When you get that rush of messages from your users about something breaking, it's embarrassing telling them that it's something you can't fix. It happens regularly. The users assume it's your fault, and your application is penalized for it (users remove it, give it bad reviews).<p>Anyway, this is enough ranting. I'm not sure if it's a staffing problem or what, but hopefully these APIs will receive more attention one day.",1235527184

Google was a success because they created a game changing search product - it was (and still is) vastly better then anything else out there.<p>I think however that while everyone tries to create a game changing product, the vast majority of products are really incremental improvements and in these cases going viral helps.  Twitter being a great case in point - really just an iteration somewhere between IM/Email/Blogging - but went viral enough to be important, over some better platforms such as Jaiku.",1235527144

The attitudes are proportionally high-maintenance. It is a very bad place for a young man to be.  Avoid it at all costs.  The only place I can think of that could be worse is possibly silicon valley.<p>As far as the Pacific NW, I don't know much of it and what the prevailing attitudes are.  I'm guessing the distance from NY can't be a bad thing and you are more likely to run into females with a more naturalistic, feminine affect.  Never been there though, so I am not the man to ask.<p>I'm dead serious about the dilution hit.  Something happens around 30 that suddenly puts you incredibly at ease at the same time that the women are getting more anxious.  Also, the younger ones (early 20s) start making themselves more available. I can't tell you how many propositions I have gotten from women who wouldn't look at me once in high school.

All those people out there trying to solve problems will find the pain points and need solutions - that’s the whole point of listening to your customers.  The catch is that other people may be listening to your customers as well.  Thus innovation and competition.<p>I think Microsoft sees itself as a ""platform"" company, not a ""product"" company.  In that context, it doesn’t need to be first to win - it simply needs to be the best at integrating the pieces into a cohesive unit.  Platforms are for dealing with general problems and not specific ones, so individual features may get copied or innovative companies may get bought when you’re trying to build a common base that a large number of people can build on.  The strategy of keeping an eye on what’s being done and incorporating the best and trying to improve on it sounds like a smart business strategy for a platform company to me.",1235525790

493909,comment,493856,493894,0,0,jerf,,,"There's a decent chance that the GbE can fall back to 10Mbps ethernet, just as it can certainly fall back to 100Mbps ethernet. The 10Mbps Ethernet standard was released in 1982 (<a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/05/09/19FEether.sb2_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/05/09/19FEether.sb2_1.ht...</a>), so I'm going to guess that by 1989 there must have been at least one 10Mbps card.<p>Edit: It occured to me I should check the timeline on 100Mbps ethernet. According to <a href=""http://www.broadcom.com/company/timeline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.broadcom.com/company/timeline/</a> , the first 100Mbps ethernet product was shipped in 1994, so we're definitely looking at 10Mbps. (Note even if that's off one way or the other by a year or two it doesn't matter for this discussion.)<p>USB will be a problem, because they'll have to reverse-engineer the protocol, but I'm sure with work they could get it to fall back to a USB1 speed that they could figure out how to work with. The problem there isn't so much the USB as figuring out how to send keyboard events, but even then I bet they could figure it out pretty quickly since I'd lay money the USB keyboard standard is deliberately as close to the old keyboard standards as possible.<p>However, you are grotesquely underestimating the people of 1989 if you think they're going to be shocked by the idea of a ""faster serial port with some defined standards for devices"", and you're just factually wrong that they'll be confused by an ethernet port. RS-232 serial ports date back to <i>1969</i>, and survived into the mid-to-late 1990s, for instance.<p>This is another one of those ""there really isn't anything new in computing under the sun"" things. It's hard to name an idea that someone from 1989 wouldn't have heard of or understand, they just lack the hardware to experiment with it for $200 1989 dollars.<p>Have more respect for your predecessors.

You're talking about a separate issue, which is that it's very hard (impossible, in most cases) for a city to become a startup hub if it's not one.<p>Government intervention is not going to turn Dubuque, Iowa into a startup hub. There are too many ingredients necessary-- good universities, venture capital, entrepreneurial culture, good hackers, the ability to reach relevant customers, and reasons for a startup to stay there once it is successful. It would be possible to upgrade cities that have some or most of these ingredients (e.g. Pittsburgh or Minneapolis) to full-blown startup hubs, but most cities will never reach that level. However, the nearly impossible problem of turning Dubuque into a startup hub has nothing to do with that of increasing entrepreneurship on a national basis.<p><i>Seems to me, and it's just my opinion, but societies with lots of government-provided goodies actually have less startups.</i><p>I would imagine that you're talking about the European countries, but the government benefits have nearly nothing to do with the EU having fewer startups.

The thing is that the part of the society which is connected with the government, local authorities, parliament, city councils, etc. is relatedly separated from the rest of the population. Of course there's no barrier of entry but the perspectives of growth are relatively limited for a newcomer.<p>Consequently at all elections the same group of people competes for the seats (to some extend). It's especially visible on regional layer. In fact this situation hasn't changed from the Soviet period.<p>And as you might imagine these people are very uncomfortable with that democratic thingy. During the late 90s the United Russia was introduced to support the most popular politician of that time (Putin). It was created from the ground up and expanded very aggressively. Joining that party looked like a clear opportunity to improve once position. That's why everybody tried to jump in.<p>The resulting growth was enormous! And combined with a complete inability of right parties to form a strong opposition this resulted in the formation of the superparty. Suddenly everybody in this ruling slice of the society felt the comfort of the good old days of the Soviet Era: 'just join UR to get a warm fuzzy feeling' :)<p>Now here's the thing western people do not understand: this situation is Ok! It's much much better than what Russia had during the 90s. One thing Putin tries to teach other politicians it that there're some formal rules which they should follow at least to some extend. As it was already said at least small and medium businesses are not forced to pay for 'protection'. That's a huge thing because it affects the whole nation. People have at least some confidence and feel secure.<p>After all democracy is not that much important. And comparing to China democracy is doing pretty well in Russia.<p>The real political problem today is the lack of strong right opposition. Communists are doing pretty well on the left side with about 20% of support among the population. But on the right side there was never a strong entity. If there's one I'm sure it could get about the same support ratio. These two strong oppositions could ultimately overcome this superparty situation. Than it depends. If UR gets divided into two parties Russia will end up with two identical parties of equal power (US model). If it stays united then it will be a three-party system (European model). Anyway, if there are no revolutions or big wars I would expect them to become democratic before the end of the century. Otherwise we'll have to wait even longer.<p>Personally I do not expect to see a democratic Russia during my lifetime (I'm in my early 20s).<p>Thing you should know:<p>1. Despite what you might be told by your officials Russia is not a big deal. It's just a country.<p>2. They are not your enemy and they never want to.<p>3. If you let them (and help them) build a better image of Russia they'll be very thankful.<p>4. They want to fell big and important. So be it. If your president decided to gang up with a couple of others just invite Russian leader over as well. Meeting in Russia is a good idea as well.<p>5. When the right opposition start to form don't rush and don't give them you aid. Otherwise it's reputation will be tarnished among the nation. It must be a homegrown thing. That's something US gov and NGO screw things up all the time. Once there're western money involved these democrats will start targeting each other, not the superpower. Look at a Belorussian opposition as an example.<p>6. Just do what you have to anyway: go green, improve recycling, ease the environmental pressure, reduce oil and gas consumption. Once you do it you won't give a dime about their pipes.<p>7. Bring all that green high tech to Russia. Russians are smart and they want to live on a healthy planet, too.<p>Communism is not really a bad thing and it doesn't prevent the democracy. I live in a western European country now. But when I walk along the streets I see the same life my parents had in Soviet Russia. How ironic is that!<p>edit: formatting",1235523751

Aviation and the space program, the internet, scores of ""trickle down"" consumer electronics such as GPS, Popeye (created to sell a surplus of canned spinach after WWII!), the list goes on and on. Plus there's the education of large numbers of the population that would otherwise lack opportunity.<p>The doctrine of ""small government and a strong military"" is an oxymoron. Military spending is an extremely effective form of high tech government subsidy. Of course the downside of having a huge military is the temptation to use it inappropriately...",1235523639

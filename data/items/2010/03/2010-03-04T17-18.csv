Imagine if people told Plato he couldn't write about philosophy because he didn't go to harvard and get a degree in philosophy.  Or tell galileo that he was wrong because he didn't have a degree in astronomy.<p>Valid scientific investigations don't require scientific training.  This person, who wrote some code and plotted some numbers on a graph may know more about math and programming and data visualization than many of those running weather stations, so it isn't productive to say this person has nothing to contribute because he's someone without scientific training.<p>You don't even know that statement is true.  Regardless of its truth, the numbers, the code, and the result should speak for themselves.  It doesn't matter whether the investigator is trained in science or not.<p>As a ""trained"" computer engineer, I am personally capable of taking a raw data set and plotting their numbers on a chart and drawing conclusions from them.<p>Of course there are additional steps one could take with this data to help the human mind comprehend it.

However, it's <i>still</i> the case with Ubuntu that it's common to install something, try it, and then be unable to get things back to the way they were before (mostly speaking of desktops, WMs, and themes, here).

As I say, it's logically possibly that there could be such a causal relation, but in general there's no reason to think that doing X should feel like doing Y -- you'd expect it to feel like doing X! If I don't know what my choice will be, I'd expect that to feel like not knowing what my choice will be. Which is a distinct state from feeling that I have freedom of choice.<p>In fact if you use your imagination, you can come up with scenarios in which you don't know what your future choice will be, but it clearly doesn't feel like a <i>free</i> choice. E.g. if you say ""I will choose to get a coffee if I roll the die and the number is 3 or above, or a tea otherwise.""",1267722188

I personally have been in a similar situation (assailant had a gun). As well, I have trained since a young age in defensive combat. I can honestly say that when that moment was upon me, the rage that ran through my mind was not for saving myself but the idea that a little old lady had most likely stood in my same position and that the people around me are being victimized. I think most that do decide to stand, stand for a sense of honor that is beyond them or their personal well being, because even to them, logically the money is not worth it, it is the principal of the matter.

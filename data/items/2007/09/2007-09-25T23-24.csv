59620,comment,59596,59616,0,0,dcurtis,,,"I'm not sure what you're asking here-- Netflix doesn't care about anything but movies, and it probably wouldn't be able to recommend movies any better if it knew your musical tastes, or even how your tastes compare to mine.<p>The idea is that if you search for ""sony SSK70ED,"" on the ""discovery engine,"" it will show you what other people have paired with those speakers, such as receivers, furniture, and televisions. In a way those things are ""similar"" to the speakers because they complement them. Of course, the system shows you similar speakers first, but the complementing items are interesting results to have when you're searching for a specific item.",1190764656
59619,comment,59596,59616,0,0,steffon,,,"This page explains many of netflix's limitations well:  <a href=""http://harry.hchen1.com/2006/10/03/391"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harry.hchen1.com/2006/10/03/391</a>.  But more importantly, look at these limitations in light of how the discovery engine is organizing its preference data and how it's collecting preference data.<p>The critical difference with the discovery engine is the idea of a group of content that users fill themselves with content based on criteria they see as relevant.  Yes, a users aggregate preference composition is important, but what is more important is their set of preferences regarding a specific collection of content.  This way, a user can be really into classical music, horror movies, and modern furniture, and get relevant recommendations for each interest, connecting with people who are most in the know regarding each interest.",1190764566
59618,comment,59473,59595,0,0,juwo,,,"1) I hate to say it but often lower castes have dark skin and african features. You will also find most of the brightest students in a University are brahmins - the highest caste - just ask your friends their caste and correlate with their intelligence. The caste system is racist. You cannot change your caste. Period. You were born with it. It is interesting but sad. Forced hereditary occupations lead to differences in appearance and even IQ across thousands of years. Low castes clean toilets - high castes are priests in temples (translation: the intellectual leaders today).<p>2) The caste system is very prevalent. It also leads to corruption similarly as Rick Warren found tribalism was the cause of corruption in Africa.<p>3) How many white-black mixed marriages do you see in America? Not many. Most kids up for adoption are biracial black-white. The prejudices remain over here in the USA - at least in relationships. Read the chapter on preferences in interracial dating in the book Freakonomics.",1190764536

But Paul Graham has expressed a desire that we keep the ""(pic) virus"" off of this site which I think is pretty much a blanket ban... even the Y Combinator tattoo picture came wrapped up in a short article.<p>Sorry.<p>By the way, do you know where I can get a copy of The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949? $30 is more than I ever pay for recorded music.",1190764403

59615,comment,59596,59613,0,0,rms,,,"It made sense to me. It's a great idea but implementation is going to be incredibly challenging. It's only doomed if the founders don't have the skills to actually implement a better recommendation everything.<p>I think an uber-short pitch here is ""A better recommendation engine for everything"" which of course only makes sense if you know what a recommendation engine is.",1190763820
59614,comment,59596,59610,0,0,dcurtis,,,"The point of having groups of content is to combine traditionally dissimilar types of content-- movies, music, housewares, etc...<p>For example I can make a group of content called ""new living room"" and add all of the things that go into my new living room. This includes the music and movies that I have stored there, the type of TV I bought, the type of couch, stereo receiver, speakers, or even the paint on the wall. When someone searches for something within that collection, the system knows that someone else, somewhere, has combined that ""thing"" with the other ""things"" in the collection, so they get rated higher as being compatible.

59612,comment,59596,59605,0,0,steffon,,,"Here are two large differences between IRC:<p>1.) One of the main problems I am trying to solve is in your second sentence: ""Once you find a chan you like...""  It's time consuming to find new content you like, especially in a setting as nebulous (for most people) as IRC.  With the discovery engine, all a user needs to do is rate recommendations based on what they are interested in, and they are immediately connected with groups of like-minded people and what they know.  Fast and easy.<p>2.) In addition to connecting to groups of like-minded people, the user gets recommendations from those who are most influential and most in the know.  All content is not equally desirable, and users using the discovery engine will only get recommended that content which has empirically shown is wanted by people that think like them (relevant).",1190763189

59608,comment,59420,59479,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""...  I don't see a whole lot of value in it. ...""</i> <p>I wonder about how creating tech tools like this can add more value? Is this an example of a tool looking for a market? (one hint is 10+ examples of what you can use it for) Or could it, if it solved one specific UI niche problem in a <i>""foo""</i> app become a more useful and potentially more valuable?  <p><pre><code>    ""Cool idea. How do I do it?

</code></pre>
One reason I can see why the tool could look lame is it is only worthwhile to creators. If you are not a creator, artist, cartoonist, someone who draws then you can be left with what appears to be a trivial toy. <p>But if you applied the technology to an application that users <i>""might""</i> want (one that comes to mind is virtual birthday cards - sign the card with others & send it to someone) it becomes a powerful tool and maybe a business ~ <a href=""http://sketch.basement.org/2007/07/introducing_sketchcasting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sketch.basement.org/2007/07/introducing_sketchcasting...</a> ",1190762592
59607,comment,59596,59603,0,0,steffon,,,"""groups of content"" are collections of content that users create themselves (the social bookmarking aspect of the site).  Users that want to build a reputation for being in the know and influential are incentivized to make these collections relevant.  The groups also become lists users can form to bookmark content they find around the web and want to save it one spot.<p>Based on what you have put into your collection of content, and collections others have made, the algorithm aggregates those similar people into the same network.  People in the same network get content recommended to each other from their like-minded peers that they have not discovered on their own.<p>With regards to the feasability of such an algorithm, I've talked about it with many mathematicians and machine learning programmers and the wheel does not have to be reinvented for this application.  The tools already exist, and just have to be customized and tweaked for this application.",1190762413

59605,comment,59596,59596,0,0,oditogre,,,"Sounds like IRC.  Once you find a chan you like and kind of settle in, you realize that the actual convo rarely relates to the title of the chan, but is still of interest to the people who regularly go there.<p>IRC is pretty popular, I don't see why your idea wouldn't be among the less BitchX-inclined internet crowd. ;-P<p>You'd have to be <i>brutal</i> with the 'influence' system, though, to keep the trolls out of the 'ponies and barbie dolls' group.<p>The killer feature, to me, of an idea like this would be something like musicovery.com, where overlapping things lead you down new paths.",1190761828

59603,comment,59596,59596,0,0,anamax,,,"What determines ""groups of content"" (people? algorithms? either way, the value is in figuring out how)<p>It isn't clear why ""domain-specific"" recommendation systems don't work within a group.<p>Note that it isn't obviously true that separating by group actually produces better recommendations.  In fact, the (inadequate) evidence that I'm aware of indicates the exact opposite.<p>BTW - If you don't have the algorithms mentioned, how much do you think that you actually have?

59602,comment,59596,59596,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Here's an example of how I would use something like this:
I want to watch a movie that's similar to Jurassic Park. I can go to the site and type that in. The web application picks apart the constituent pieces of ""jurassic park,"" like ""action movie"" and ""dinosaurs"" and ""made a lot of money,"" then looks for other movies that match the criteria based on information from IMDB, Google, and MPAA. <p>Then, it looks for people who have voted/commented on the movie, and extrapolates a probability of you liking other movies that they have rated highly or poorly. If your rating history is similar to theirs, it rates their other movies with similar pieces higher. If your history is very different, or if they voted Jurassic Park very poorly, then the other items they voted highly are placed low on your recommendations.<p>I think that's awesome. <p>

This way when you showup, lots of your preferences and rating ""work"" comes along with you.  Additionally, the preference dataset is jumpstarted.<p>What you would tell your little sister about the site is ""find more things you like, and if you're good at finding new content, be recognized for it.""",1190761359

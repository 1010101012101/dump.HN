8283585,comment,8283006,8283557,1,0,iLoch,,,"The pattern I&#x27;ve seen used most commonly is the latter situation you described. The user authenticates, and is issued a signed JWT which includes their user ID and (optionally - I actually talk about this in my comment here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8283530"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8283530</a>) an expiration. You can also delegate roles and permissions through the JWT, which makes for a really slick authorization pattern if you&#x27;ve got a case where you&#x27;d like to easily change a user&#x27;s permissions. I mean, you can add whatever you want to a JWT - I guess I&#x27;m just offering suggestions based on my own experience. IMO, user ID is the best way to go, because it&#x27;s only a single field you have to maintain. If you start adding too much information in there you might end up with a bunch of tokens with old property names etc. Personally I just tried to closely follow what OAuth specified should be added to OAuth JWTs. I think I&#x27;ve got &quot;issuer&quot;, &quot;audience&quot;, &quot;expiry&quot; and &quot;id&quot; in my current tokens, but adding a list of permissions would be a good choice too in my opinion.<p>I think what everyone needs to remember is that SSL is a must for these things. If you&#x27;re issuing non-expiring tokens over non-SSL you&#x27;re just giving the keys to the castle away. Another thing that should be considered is token storage. I&#x27;m using local storage right now which works for me, but it just means I need to be more careful than ever about XSS exploits, because there&#x27;s no &quot;HTTP only&quot; option for local storage!",1410155982

Some intuition if they made a lucky guess about their opponent, perhaps, or a feeling if they had a lucky outcome, or (unknown to them) miscalculated &quot;pot odds.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve found that in the same way that most people believe they are good poker players, or above average drivers, people tend to believe that they are good at anything where skill and talent is not directly obvious (basketball, for instance), or start believing that long before they are actually good at it.<p>Looking up local photographers on FB is one of my favorite pastimes for this reason.",1410155109

The idea was that the more safe you feel, the more likely you are to engage in unsafe behavior. The example given was that cyclists with helmets were much less cautious of traffic than bicyclists without helmets.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure if this has to do with cars feeling more safe or just the prevalence of smart phones, but driving down the interstate and paying close attention to what other cars are doing is terrifying. Literally every day I see a number of people driving 70+ MPH and slightly drifting over the lines or driving with their phones perched in front of them on the steering wheel.

8283557,comment,8283006,8283006,4,0,Todd,,,"This is a pretty elegant solution for delegated authority, too. If you have client-side code as well as server-side code that both access an API, JWTs can give you a uniform way of handling authorization at the API level.<p>Client side access is pretty well understood. A JWT can be stored in a cookie and then added to Ajax requests as a bearer token, for example.<p>The server-side code will typically have some way of validating the client, such as an encoded cookie. This will be used to build a user object of some sort, which can be used to run authorization checks. When the server side needs to access the API, the user object can be serialized into a JWT and added as a request header, similar to typical client-side access. If it&#x27;s done well, the API can use a very similar user object to check authorization. Another option is just to do JWT pass-through. If this is done, the signature should at least be checked to avoid facilitating an impersonation attack.<p>JWTs have built in signing to ensure that the user object is intact.

It&#x27;s interesting to note that not too long before this was written, he was highly opinionated about the language in a very different way:<p>> I have participated in one of the first Feyerabend workshops, organized by Richard Gabriel, one of the main drivers behind the original Common Lisp effort. I have also read his book Patterns of Software around that time. Later we had a small discussion in the patterns discussion mailing list. He tried to promote Lisp as a language that has the &quot;quality without a name&quot;, and I made some cursory remarks about Lisp&#x27;s unnecessarily complicated syntax, just like anybody else who doesn&#x27;t get it yet.<p>> To me, the most important comment he made in that discussion was: &quot;True, only the creatively intelligent can prosper in the Lisp world.&quot; The arrogance I perceived in that comment annoyed me so much that it made me want to learn Lisp seriously, just to prove him wrong and show him that Lisp is not as great as he thought it is.

The idea that we seem to be failing to convey is that in most cases of casual research online it ends up taking hours and is not completely optimized. Also content ownership online is near impossible for the lay user - For e.g. Who has the time to author a wiki - but what if you could just drag and drop what&#x27;s relevant and add some notes here and there, add connections to show a flow of thought and share it with someone. I used to teach engineering undergrads and signed up to work on Linkwok only cause I saw the value - Imagine lecture notes and lesson plans as Linkwok searchmaps! Where teachers and students can interact as well.<p>We get that search is private so by default everything IS PRIVATE on Linkwok but then content authorship is NOT generally private. So Linkwok caters to that as well.<p>Consider this:\n1. When users search online and you&#x27;re distracted or switch to a different task, it takes them a while to get their bearings with all those tabs etc. Or when you bookmark, unless you open the page you often don&#x27;t know what it was. Here, every page can be stored as a visiting card - edit the name and description to something you remember\n2. Users often don&#x27;t remember how they got to a particular page - what they searched for when they found it. On Linkwok every page you add gets tagged with the search query. \n3. There are several use cases where people need to collaborate when doing research and Linkwok directly caters to this.\n4. It brings content authorship to the lay user cause it is supposed to be simple - ideally - evidently we need to fix the UI and UX a bit. \n5. People search for similar things - If someone has found and curated the information for that topic why not continue from where they left off?<p>Finally, to my mind there&#x27;s three kinds of searches that occur - broadly.\n1. Where the user searches for something, the first link is all he needs and he&#x27;s done. Linkwok is not for this case.\n2. Where a user needs to iterate queries until he gets what he needs - Linkwok can come in mighty handy here.\n3. Where one answer is not enough -one link is not enough - And here too Linkwok comes in handy<p>And if Linkwok searchmaps can come in handy for 2 and 3 - won&#x27;t a searchmap also become a one stop for case 1 as well?

The idea that religion is purely about <i>beliefs</i> is a Protestant idea - for most people, their religion is about community, ritual, and accessing deep emotions or altered states of consciousness. Protestantism rejected most of this in favour of a purely &#x27;rational&#x27; faith, from where it&#x27;s baby steps towards giving up faith entirely in favour of pure reason.

8283537,comment,8282373,8283018,1,0,nmjohn,,,"> There was a great article published in PLOS several years ago (ATM I don&#x27;t have the link) showing mathematically that the odds were about 1 in a million that an observational study like the above would turn out to be a &quot;true&quot; causal relationship, and the author concluded most published studies were junk.<p>I very much doubt the second part of that, that most published studies are junk. The idea that not showing a causal link and only a correlational one makes a study junk is not held by anyone in the field who garners a whole lot of respect or notoriety. I&#x27;m not saying the quality is equal whatsoever, simply that correlation studies are not inherently junk - some are fantastic and some are quite the opposite.<p>There is no question that journals in general are pumping out a significant amount of junk (in studies of all types), but I speculate the root cause of that has more to do with the rise of &quot;publish or perish&quot; and significant increases in grad school enrollment. And even worse the notion that for a grad student, the number of publications they have their name attributed to is more important than the content they publish in terms of employment after they graduate. So there is a situation where people have more pressure to publish than ever before [0], there is more competition for scarce funding so studies are vastly underfunded and studies are rushed so another can begin to add to the resume.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean there is less good science being done either! There probably is more good science being published now than ever before, the problem is the signal:noise ratio has gone down making it harder for good studies to get media attention, and easier for the media to latch on to whatever story they think will get viewers.<p>[0]: Sidenote, this also makes it increasingly challenging not only to have high quality research, but research that only is making a correlation as opposed to going through and providing evidence to claim you might have a causal link.",1410154075

I thought I was so clever with my custom PHP framework and sessionless backend. That said, it&#x27;s done because it works well and makes sense. I&#x27;m glad to see we&#x27;re finally settling on a recommended way of doing this.<p>I&#x27;ve recently incorporated JWTs into my own application. One of the questions I&#x27;d like to ask other HNers is how you deal with token expiration. I don&#x27;t want to reissue a token if I don&#x27;t have to, but I don&#x27;t want to create permanent tokens either. An obvious solution is to embed an expiry in the token and check against that, however I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;ll lead to a very good UX if tokens &quot;randomly&quot; expire. I&#x27;ve come up with two solutions: 1.) Each user has a session seed token that is used as the secret and thus a user can log out of all sessions by requesting a secret change. This works because any previous JWTs are now invalid because they cannot be validated with the new secret. 2.) I could ping the server periodically (or decode the JWT on the client side) and check when the token expires. Shortly before the token expires, I could request a new one. This doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of tokens expiring when the user is offline though. Anyone have any better solutions?",1410153913

I just remember a steady stream of movies about human extinction from nuclear war, disease, climate change, comets, zombies (of course), aliens, apes, etc. People still make apocalyptic movies, of course, but it just felt like fear of extinction was more in the collective subconscious then than it is now.

The last Android app I launched, in conjunction with another programmer, was a Thesaurus app.  There are a few Android thesaurus apps out there, but ours does all the EFIGS languages (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish) as well as one or two others.<p>The Android app is built on such things as the BSD licensed MyThes library and the LGPL licensed Hunspell library.  We connect to the open source C/C++ libraries via JNI, do some Android UI and some other coding, and voila, a useful app.  MyThes does the thesaurus part, Hunspell is useful for certain things - like finding word stems so that we are accepting plural for nouns (mouse or mice), or some different tenses for verbs (sing, singing, sung).<p>All the different language libraries were too big to pack with the Android APK so we made the language libraries free download packs.  But then the app is useless while it is being downloaded.  So I wrote a backend API to do MyThes/Hunspell on a Linux VPS and ctypes C/C++ library foreign functions for Python, so that people could avoid downloading the language packs if they wanted, or at least could search words while waiting for their language pack to download.<p>Once all that was in place, I said to myself, why not throw a website up?

But I found it very readable.<p>As an addition, I can think of these patterns (just thinking about it in 1 minute, mostly remembering Erlang talks I&#x27;ve listen to, some from practice):<p>* Build system out of isolated components. Isolation will prevent failures from propagating. In Erlang just launch a process and don&#x27;t use custom compiled C modules loaded in the VM. In other cases launch an OS process (or container).<p>* If your service is running on one single machine, it is not fault tolerant.<p>* Don&#x27;t handle errors locally. Build a supervision tree where some of part of the system does just the work it is are intended to (ex.: handling a client&#x27;s request), and other (isolated part) does the monitoring and error handling. Have one process monitor others, one machine monitor another etc.<p>Once a segfault or malloc fault has occurred installing a handler and trying to recover might not be the best solution. Restarting an OS (or Erlang) process might be easier. Another way to put it, once the process has been fouled up, don&#x27;t trust it to heal itself. Trust another one to clean up after it and spawn a new instance it.<p>* Try not to have a master or a single point of failure. Sometimes having a master is unavoidable to create a consistent system, so maybe it can be elected with a well defined algorithm or library (paxos, zab, raft etc).<p>* Try to build a crash-only system. So that isolated units (OS or Erlang processes) can be killed instantaneously for any reason, any time and system would still work. If you are controlling the system you are building use atomic file renames, append-only logs, and SIGKILL (or technologies that use those underneath). Don&#x27;t rely on orderly shutdowns. Sometimes you are forced to use databases/hardware/system that already don&#x27;t behave nicely. Then you might not have a choice.<p>* Always test failure modes as much as possible. Randomly kill or mess with your isolated units (kill your processes), degrade your network, simulate switch failures, power failures, storage failure. Then simulate multiple failure simultaneously -- your software crashes while you detected a hardware failure and so on.<p>* As a side-effect of first point and the crash-only property. Think very well about your storage. In order to be able to restart a process, it means, it might have had to save a sane checkpoint of its state. That means having reliable, stable and fault tolerant storage system. Sometimes recomputing the state works as well.",1410152752

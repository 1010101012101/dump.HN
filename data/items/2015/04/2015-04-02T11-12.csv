The purpose of a minimum viable product is to test its feasibility. Purchasing something that&#x27;s new and fresh should come with the (implied) disclaimer that it might not work as intended, at least until they get the kinks out. Buying in early just means you get a head start on all the frustration that comes with a new gizmo that&#x27;s really just out there as a springboard to feel out what consumers want and what direction to take it.<p>Methinks the author should think twice before impulse buying shitty gadgets, especially considering how young the IoT is as a concept. There&#x27;s still a lot of ground to cover on the idea of IoT itself, and a lot of things that need to be defined before we start seeing IoT devices as more than novelties and knick-knacks.

The trade deficit is <i>nothing</i> like personal finances/expenditures; this is a common meme in Germany, though, so I understand where you might have gotten the idea from. (Germany is presently dragging down the entire Eurozone with these beliefs.) You are not &quot;borrowing&quot; by having a trade deficit (nor do you have to borrow to have one.) It&#x27;s just an outflow of currency, which is not particularly harmful to countries printing their own currency.<p>> There are many reasons why the US does not have free college (taxes too low, universities are run like business now, etc.) but running huge deficits and not having any savings to invest in society is one of the reasons.<p>This is not a reason at all. The <i>trade</i> deficit has nothing to do with US <i>budget</i> deficits, and the US still has <i>plenty</i> of money to invest back into society. It&#x27;s a matter of political will and the way the government and education is organized. A lot has changed over the past decade for the worse and the better. Before the recession, there were actually enormous state subsidies to public universities that reduced their cost. During the recession, states began cutting back, which has been a contributor to rising college costs. At the same time, the government has modified the student loan program to be <i>much</i> better: indeed under the program as it now exists it&#x27;s not really so much a loan as it is a tax on your post-college earnings. At the same time, universities are plagued with large, overpaid bureaucratic administrations, an increasing focus on new amenities, and perhaps even worse, a sense that the more money it costs to attend, the better the college must be. Students are in part rewarding colleges for raising prices - conservatives blame this on the ease of finding loans to pay for school, but I think the situation is more complex. If you had a dramatic restructuring of the US system, say, for example, you slashed public university administration budgets and froze spending on anything non-academic, instituted price controls, and consolidated all the various local, state, and federal programs to fund schools or scholarships, you could probably make college a lot cheaper or even free right now with minimal tax increases. The wealth and resources are already there. There was actually an Obama proposal to make community college free (a small step toward this), which the media estimated would cost 15 billion - chump change in the US budget.<p>As an aside, college costs are more complicated than people think. In many (most?) states, sufficient academic performance (as measured by an ACT or SAT score) automatically guarantees a full scholarship (or less, depending on your score.)<p>You also have community colleges, which are much cheaper and allow you to obtain a two year degree and transfer to a four-year university.<p>Once you get outside of private colleges and the big-name schools (usually on the coasts), public university costs are much reduced. And you can get in even if you&#x27;re academically terrible, a situation you don&#x27;t necessarily have in the European systems.<p>For example: I attended community college for free because of my ACT score. I could have gone directly to university for free, but I chose not to because of my age. I transferred to a four year school, paid for 3 (2.5 undergrad, .5 grad) years with money I earned at a minimum wage job, and then finished out grad school with an assistantship that paid my tuition plus a stipend. I graduated four years ago. This is still easily doable in most of the country. In fact it&#x27;s still exactly doable if you just go directly to university and don&#x27;t have to pay anything.",1427975446

Beverly Hills uses more than four times as much as Compton, and it has no agriculture or golf courses either (though it is next to one)<p>The point is that Melbourne is a perfectly workable city, and it gets by on a fraction of the per-capita residential use water that Californians do.

The gate to my place is the very dead end.<p>That&#x27;s why people have a hard time finding my place. Now, I feel like talking about security a bit more.<p>After the gate you have other 20 m (~65 feet) to the door, and most valuables are upstairs.<p>Basically a burglar would have to take multiple trips, up and down inside and outside stairs, to load up a car/van parked before the narrow end, with faces and plates invariably captured by cameras.

Somebody could jump into my garden over the 2 m (~6.5 feet) wall from my neighbor&#x27;s, but they have to break into the (wealthier) neighbor&#x27;s before.<p>The rest of the garden is surrounded by a concrete wall, 2 m (~6.5 feet) high on my side, 3 m (~10 feet) on the other side, that separates my house from a residence complex with its own security and all.

Each and every car is different in every aspect. In Europe it is very common that you order your car they way you like it and do not buy the one that dealer has in its parking lot. You order to your specification and the option lists are huge compared to the one from Tesla.<p>Tesla is having only one Model with limited different features and many same parts from Ford, Audi, Mercedes, Bosch and others and still is unable to keep up with delivery as you can see from their latest IR reports.<p>BTW, the Tesla plant is build with German technology by German companies.

9309922,comment,9308595,9308595,0,0,nadam,,,"&quot;Once you realize that computing is all about constructing, manipulating, and reasoning about abstractions, it becomes clear that an important prerequisite for writing (good) computer programs is an ability to handle abstractions in a precise manner. Now that, as it happens, is something that we humans have been doing successfully for over three thousand years. We call it mathematics.
This suggests that learning and doing mathematics might play an important role in educating future computer professionals.
&quot;<p>The conclusion is not good. The logical conclusion would be that if we define mathematics as &#x27;handling abstractions in a precise manner&#x27; then programming is part of mathematics.
In this case his conclusion becomes:<p>&#x27;learning and doing some classical parts of mathematics might play an important role in educating people who will do this another part of mathematics&#x27;<p>Which might be true to an extent, but this statement is very broad.<p>It is not a question that some amount of math is helpful. But after a while there are diminishing returns, because you simply learn different skills than what you need.<p>After having some very basic math knowledge the best strategy is to try to learn a lot of practical &#x27;engineering&#x27; from very good books/courses, and only go back to math on-demand.<p>For example if you want to have some knowledge on machine learning or computer graphics, don&#x27;t start to learn math for years first and then start learning about machine learning/3d graphics. Start to learn abut the engineering field first (take Andrew Ng&#x27;s coursera class, or some equivalent in 3D graphics) and only go back to learn some linear algebra or very basic calculus after you see why it will be useful and to what degree you need it (you mostly don&#x27;t need most of the theorems if you are learning the basics of these engineering fields).<p>Being an engineer is very different than being a mathematician. If you want to be a good engineer then mostly learn a lot from good engineers (or researchers in the engineering field) and learn some math along the way, but that will be secondary in my opinion.
It&#x27;s good to learn tons of math, but only if you learn even more engineering besides the math (to be a good engineer).",1427973484

It should not come as a surprise that not everyone finishes their course. In fact, tough exams after a year of study serve to weed out the weaker students. This gives everyone the chance to prove themselves in the subject, not some random test.

What follows is my experience, which is good as anecdote only.<p>I use MariaDB-Galera in a project of mine to be able to run it in a parallel fashion. To determine if the servers were suitable for my use, I tried to install MariaDB-Galera, only to find out:<p>- MariaDB doesn&#x27;t officially support ARM yet;<p>- The Debian and Ubuntu repos don&#x27;t have the MariaDB-Galera edition available;<p>- All repos I could find with the Galera edition didn&#x27;t have it compiled for armhf, including the official repo, by virtue of the first point.<p>- Compiling it on the server resulted in other problems: besides the usual compile errors that can be more or less sorted out by hand, and the dependency hell of the resulting deb packages (remember, no armhf packages available) I figured it would be unacceptable (in terms of ease-of-maintenance) to have to recompile MariaDB every time a new version with security fixes came out. This is something I can live with when toying with Raspberry Pis and similar things, but not on production stuff.<p>I eventually gave up, declaring the servers unsuitable for <i>my</i> use. End of anecdote.<p>IMHO they are charging too much for the product, at a time when the ARM ecosystem is not yet ready for server use (the architecture and OS support are fine, the user-land software, not so much). The servers are bare metal (it&#x27;s awesome being able to use as much CPU as you want without breaching AUPs or hitting artificial caps), but the networked storage, while definitely better than HDDs, may not fulfill the needs of those with higher I/O requirements (I admit I haven&#x27;t tested, also by virtue of Galera not being available). Lastly, the prices first show without VAT, which means that if you&#x27;re in the EU and without a VAT ID, it&#x27;ll turn out to be even more expensive.

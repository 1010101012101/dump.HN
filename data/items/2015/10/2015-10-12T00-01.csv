The internet is not the place to seek a diagnosis. Make an appointment with your primary care provider or a qualified mental health professional. There are a number of illnesses that can manifest themselves in ways archaically referred to as mental. Just keep in mind that everything that happens in your brain is chemical and electrical. If you are having a psychotic break, and believe me I do not mean that as a pejorative but simply as a medical term then you need qualified medical care. When asked, a schizophrenic patient will say when they began to hear voices they were as real to them as their friend talking from the next room. I wish you the best of luck. Get help.

Manual scheduling of jobs for startup and shutdown like we did in the rc.sh days is complex and error-prone.<p>* The text files systemd is parsing are owned by root, so even if the parser is exploitable, only root can take advantage?  Seems like a weak criticism.<p>* I agree that dependency ordering makes things more complex.  But upstart and launchd have the same issues.  It seems to be a tradeoff worth making.<p>* I don&#x27;t understand the argument against supporting both laziness and eagerness in dependencies.  It seems like some things are naturally modelled eagerly, like needing to perform a bunch of somewhat unrelated actions to suspend the system.  And some things are better handled lazily, like setting up a FUSE filesystem when a USB stick is inserted that needs it.  Shouldn&#x27;t we use the model that makes the most sense?<p>* I don&#x27;t think checkpointing a process image can ever really replace having a notification system.  Even if the checkpointing code could be make bulletproof somehow, some processes deal with state in the external world, or with hardware, that makes checkpointing infeasible.<p>* Regarding a plugin system: Systemd has the ability to run shell scripts, which can be useful in filling in gaps in functionality.  I don&#x27;t think a more complicated plugin system would be a good idea since it would add a lot of complexity (and potentially instability.)<p>* I didn&#x27;t understand the criticism of journald, maybe someone can elaborate.  The author presented some alternate approaches but I missed why these were better (other than the handwavey argument that journald was &quot;a bottleneck&quot;)<p>I enjoyed reading this, and it&#x27;s nice to see some more reasoned criticism of systemd.  I feel like the prose got a little bit purple at times.  We had to spend 10 paragraphs &quot;descend[ing] into an inferno with the same dead horse talking points&quot;, &quot;culminating into some rather heterodox conclusions&quot;, and &quot;progressively introducing and elucidating on concepts, applying some a priori reasoning at times, and backtracking to derive conclusions or reiterate on prior stated knowledge&quot; before we even saw a word of argument!

While I assume I am completely oversimplifying this statement, an ongoing bug bear of mine is business that treats marketing as an expense. Marketing is an investment. It should be treated and monitored as you would your investments. Adwords ads are not expensive, they  have a positive or negative ROI/ROMI. It doesn&#x27;t matter if a click cost $1 or $1,000, its about the following profit you get back from that click. You need to understand how you track + what your avg revenues and margins are. Adwords (and other channels) should never be expensive, they should be positive or negative returning assets.<p>Your questions;<p>> Has anyone done this before?
I&#x27;ve on both sides of contracting marketing. It makes sense to pay for specialization if you can earn a reasonable salary elsewhere.<p>> who do you outsource to?
Depends on what you need? Be careful going cheap. There is no industry accreditation and many people jump in selling promises they cant deliver. ALso yyou sound like you need someone that can advise you as much as &#x27;do as I say&#x27; type contractor. Look for experience and someone that can show you specifically why they succeeded when they took of other marketing gigs. Don&#x27;t go for the cheapest or biggest promise as an absolute.<p>> What does it cost ?Please share.
As above, you can do affiliate type deals where you only pay for success. Or you may pay $5 to $500/hr depending on what you look for. Try not to go in too light on spend. If you want to spend $500 on advertising anyone decent will cost more than that alone setting up a solid performing campaign. People often test with small amounts, hire some low cost person and then decide &#x27;marketing doesn&#x27;t work&#x27;. You need to do a shotgun type approach where you blast tests across a bunch of channels/approaches, see where the profit pattern is for you to chase. Also when you budget budget a decent spend in addition to a person. I see businesses hire a marketing person and then allocate not budget. Thats a waste of money unless they are literately after a blogger/web developer in one and that&#x27;s all you want.",1444611136

10371874,comment,10370348,10370348,0,0,tadfisher,,,"My response from another discussion on this article:<p>Much of these deficiencies boil down to the design criteria for systemd, which is basically to avoid forcing the system administrator to perform dependency graph resolution. This was a direct response to Upstart, which pushed this work to the administrator (or distro packager) by design.<p>Thus the declarative syntax for unit files, which do not explicitly control dependency resolution, parallelization, or startup order, which is simply not necessary or cared about for 99% of use cases. The 1% case there is for situations where you should not use a prebaked init system in the first place, such as when you absolutely need deterministic boots, i.e. in an embedded or realtime context.<p>> In systemd, however, the execution state is not based on explicit chain loading, but on serializing unit file options to a private ExecContext structure overlayed into Unit objects and set for service unit types.<p>This is not a problem with systemd&#x27;s design. This is a problem with software written without the assumption of reliable process supervision, which is a reasonable assumption given the history of UNIX daemonization. systemd takes the (apparently controversial) stance that processes should not manage their own execution environment, or that of their dependencies. It provides numerous prebuilt hacks to make things work for broken software, but nobody should expect systemd to design for 100% of situations where processes do Weird Shit™.<p>And yes, I&#x27;m including &quot;delegated service restarters&quot; under this umbrella. The need for something like this absolutely smells of poor design. It also flies in the face of the author&#x27;s preference for deterministic execution behavior, because by definition your process will execute differently depending on if it was started or restarted.<p>The link to &quot;systemd house of horrors&quot; [1] only proves this point.<p>> A supervisor insisting on programmatic accommodations from service writers is not the most desirable state of affairs. A rarely discussed alternative to the two common approaches is, again as with startup speed optimization minus parallelism, checkpoint/restore: checkpoint a process image from a point where initialization is known to be complete and overlay it on startup, using a tool such as DMTCP or CRIU.<p>I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but this sounds like an absolute nightmare. For one, it relies on the service exposing enough information to be checkpointed at the right time; at which point, you might as well call sd_notify or hook in a script to do it for you, so this is not a reduction in requiring programmatic accommodations from service writers. Two, process-snapshotting is not a panacea, and is a nightmare to debug when it breaks your expectations; you&#x27;ll need to test all sorts of process state, including open pipes/fds/sockets, signals, system calls (!), shmem buffers, etc. At which point it&#x27;s best to just let the service notify you directly when the process is done. Which is a facility that systemd provides.<p>> Of course we also have the issue of circular dependencies in the systemd architecture itself. We have the init, process manager, process supervisor, cgroup writer, local service tools, the Unit object structure (which might benefit from being made a protocol), timers, mounts, automounts and swaps all in the same module with ill-defined boundaries.<p>A worthy criticism. I would also like to see a bit more modularization from systemd, but I can also see the point of systemd developers not expending effort to do so. For one, it would drastically increase the number of contexts for testing (i.e. can we verify the service manager works without the cgroups module loaded, etc). I think systemd is at the point where it&#x27;s rock-solid for all of its use cases, and a pluggable/composable architecture would have delayed this situation for not very much benefit.<p>In short, systemd imposes its opinions about process init and supervision. Whether or not this is reasonable is up for debate. However, it is very useful to have both a strong opinion and a solid implementation of this opinion.<p>IMO, the idealized world that systemd supports (i.e. non-forking services, initialization notification, strict execution environment and dependency declaration, centralized and opaque init/dependency-resolution/parallelization) is a vast improvement over the status quo and actually improves the lives of service writers (by removing an entire class of responsibilities), so I think it&#x27;s a reasonable opinion and thus I think systemd has a reasonable design and architecture.<p>There are many known technical deficiencies with the implementation that are mostly being worked on, but I&#x27;m not seeing anything damning of the whole idea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://homepage.ntlworld.com./jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/systemd-house-of-horror/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepage.ntlworld.com./jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/sy...</a>",1444610694

Backed by the government is most likely the only reason the loan was written at a certain rate to begin with.<p>The point, no one who writes the loan is getting paid by the government in full and then going after the borrower and getting paid again in full.

If the military could express force against a producer the moment they refuse to supply weaponry, and before they stockpile it for themselves, then this is true. However if the period of delay between producer non-compliance and military intervention is too great, the producer may have an opportunity to stockpile enough force to mount a realistic defence.<p>The government, nor the military, controls the means of production that their Monopoly on Violence depends upon, let alone the responsiveness and potentially not even the stockpile (I&#x27;m not sure of the figures) to mount a sustained defence against cooperating producers.<p>EDIT: The idea of producers acquiring legitimacy greater than that of public institutions is also an interesting idea with respect to Monopoly on Violence.

What are your criteria for a business to be considered alive and healthy? Why are those your criteria?<p>Growth is not inherently positive, it depends on context. For example, if I tell you my cancer has grown 500% this year, it wouldn&#x27;t be good news. And before you say this is a stretched analogy, it&#x27;s not necessarily positive in tech either - if you&#x27;re growing while bleeding money, all you&#x27;re doing is bleeding more money.

Because now, you, as, say, a female programmer, are free to decorate your office in pink and with &quot;Sex In The City&quot; posters, and issues of Cosmo or whatever (if that&#x27;s what floats your boat) while your co-worker can have Doctor Who and Star Wars posters, and electronics magazines, blah, blah (or vice versa).<p>Personally I think that one of the best way to accomodate the uniqueness that makes us all individuals, is to embrace that individual nature and give people solo offices.  Of course, that&#x27;s not the only reason I advocate for private offices, but it&#x27;s hard not to think that it would help in this regard as well.",1444608461

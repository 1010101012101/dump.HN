3230610,comment,3229360,3230185,17,0,unalone,,,"> But, if Apple win the mobile war, we are screwed as far as freedom and ownership is concerned.<p>Sentences like this are why the phrase ""mobile war"" should be taken away from all of us and placed on the high shelf next to the cookie jar. ""Mobile war"" is an exciting idea  much more exciting than ""competitive mobile marketplace""  and so we like to think in these terms despite how misleading they are.<p>There is no mobile war. Apple is not out to extinguish Android. Google's not out to extinguish the iPhone. We're talking about a market of how many people, half a billion?, a billion?, billions?, and that many people means that everybody's going to want something different.<p>Me? I love my iPhone 4. I'm not a code hacker, see. My iPhone is the tool I use to hack the world around me. It gives me a camera (photo/HD video) that I can whip out at any moment. It lets me access my bank on the fly. It's got all the cutting-edge casual games I'm researching as part of my study on games. It lets me write on the fly (poetry, thoughts, essays) and have my writing waiting on my computer when I get back. It's an ambient music generator and a PDF reader that plays public radio and Pandora and, with the new GarageBand, is also my ideal recording device, since I prefer convenience of location to anything else. Now I can put a microphone in a backpack and walk to a park with some friends and record tracks with incredible ease. That, to me, is a hack.<p>I'm pretty much a huge Apple fan, but I understand people who aren't. Which is why I find lines like<p>> If android dominate and crush iphone and apple tomorrow, that is fine with me. Somebody can alway polish their own android version and make it like the magical apple products that I hear so much about.<p>disquieting. You have your Android phone! Why must you wish misfortune on my choice? I know far more Android fans who wish for Apple's demise than I know Apple fans who want Google to go under. Choice is good! And part of that choice is choosing what the focus of your ""hacks"" are. For me it's not computers, so I can benefit from a closed computer. For you it is computers, and we have open source.<p>The other disquieting thing about your comment, to me, is that you think Apple's ""magic"" is simply a matter of polish. As if you just wipe it with a rag for a few months and suddenly it gleams. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of UI/UX design. Achieving the level of elegance that Apple products frequently (not always) possess requires tremendous focus and talent. What's more, Apple's product polish doesn't just extend to their own software: they have a great history of encouraging top-notch developers to design for them. My favorite applications aren't Apple's apps; things like Notational Velocity, Coda, Sparrow, and Reeder have all made my life significantly simpler, and it's no coincidence that they were all designed by Mac-users for a Mac environment. Which is why even though Microsoft's new mobile OS is itself elegant and beautiful, I still much prefer the iPhone to Windows. It's where all the apps are. Not because Apple was the first to launch an App Store (though that helps), but because Apple encourages the perfectionism and user focus that makes its top applications great.<p>We can argue the semantics of what counts as hacker within your personal taxonomy all day, but that's useless. Jobs did great things that benefitted a lot of people, myself included.",1321188689

3230603,comment,3230233,3230233,28,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"In the late 1990s I worked for a large government agency as part of a job that employed over 1200 contractors (Welcome to government work.) Each day I'd get incredible amounts of email -- most of which was completely useless to me.<p>Before I left, I asked if I could form a small team and take part in a 2-3 month project. They had initially planned on a team of 20, but I felt that small teams, left alone and working in small timeboxes, could perform just as well.<p>Of course, we performed much better than the larger team, but the reason I tell the story is this: for purposes of my own experiment, I stopped reading emails.<p>The customer loved what we were doing, and expanded the project some. I think it lasted 5 or 6 months total. During that entire time I never turned on my email program.<p>I finally left the job. God knows how many thousands of emails built up in my inbox. But it was never a problem.<p>It was also one of the nicer experiences I've had in technology. The team just called each other or walked to each other's cube and chatted when we needed to talk, and the day was nicely free of useless distractions.<p>Why? I think the problem with email (and IM and FB now) is that <i>everything has the same interruption power</i>. The email from HR with the monthly newsletter has the same ability to disrupt your day as the email from your accountant telling you some terribly important financial news. All of it involves you switching contexts, scanning the subject line, and then deciding to deep-dive on the material or not. Hell, by the time you've switched context, you might as well read the article: your concentration is shot. Ten seconds of scanning an email header might take five or ten minutes to recover from. It's not a good trade-off. Of course, there's also the fact that people email/IM/FB others <i>simply because they can,</i> whether they have anything of import to say or not. You'd think twice if you had to walk over to somebody's cube to show them a picture of a cat, but you wouldn't blink an eye to post an article with the same content to 100 people on FB.",1321188367

By the way, calling German welfare bad is absurd and completely a matter of political and personal convictions. Some of our US friends here would call German welfare socialistic and dangerous (?).<p>There are also other reasons why people don't emigrate - language and cultural barrier is key here. Romanians and Bulgars are migrating to Italy, due to language and cultural similarities. Polish are migrating to UK - since new generations apparently speak better English than German, etc. If more people spoke German, then you would see much more emigration to Germany, hell you don't even need to migrate for the most part. Being able to get business connection with Germany going on a personal level is more than enough for one to get going.<p>What I mean is that New Europe would want more of Germany (or Old Europe) in their own countries.

And system where hard working people are protected from scores of predators. This is the gist of problems that Europe is facing currently.

They have had massive changes in their offerings which is a good thing but frustrating if your a dev strongly invested in what they offer. Often you have to rewrite your code with each new offering they push. Then ASP.NET Webforms slow death in favor of MVC, another major rewrite again. Along with the rewrites  you are giving up a huge investment you've made in webforms ( their previous offering).<p>From asp.net 1.0 to 2.0 required a rewrite to take advantage of 2.0 featureset. From linq2sql to EF where linq2sql was dropped in favor of EF and we still have no proper assurance. winforms 1.0 to 2.0 then wpf. Moving to wpf as you may guess requires a major rewrite. Then the rumors that wpf is dead. SL is the next best thing. Now they say SL is dead but your skillset will carry over to building metro style apps.<p>Perhaps he can avoid all this frustration now!",1321185643

Another way to look at it is:  is the person that spends 10 hours a day sitting at their desk any more dedicated than the person who spends 6?  The person who spends 6 hours a day at their desk can potentially produce more results if they focus on effectiveness and efficiency (Parkinson's Law in effect), especially if the ""dedicated"" 10-hour-a-day person spends 5 hours checking email.<p>It's also a generational issue that everyone goes through at some point.

One of them, which pays pretty low ($19/hr), i took through a recruiter because i needed the money -- it was after quitting my job to work on a game. The second contract i took after the first because one of the smartest programmers I have ever known called me up and offered it, (the day after I started on the first), and it pays a relatively decent wage ($35/hr).The second contract company is now asking me for more time--time which i do not have. In short, it is not a very sustainable situation.<p>So for most people the choice i have to make is pretty clear cut, right? Quit the first contract and focus solely on the second one! Except i'm kind of worried that if i quit this one (which requires me to be onsite 8-5), i'll damage my reputation, because the project isn't done.<p>I have considered asking to work from home until it is done or asking for wage parity with the other contract (because i'm now <i>losing money</i> on this contract), but again, the project isn't done and I am the only person at the company that knows how to complete it (its a legacy app written in Actionscript 2), so I am worried that this would be viewed as some form of extortion or at the very least a little dishonest, because i did present myself as a specialist and if I quit because management didn't want to pay me more, the onus is now on the IT manager that hired me, and he doesn't have a clue how the app works.<p>Thoughts?",1235584368

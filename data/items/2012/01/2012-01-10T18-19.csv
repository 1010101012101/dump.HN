3448396,comment,3448027,3448152,5,0,masklinn,,,"> I'm confused, aren't blocks just a hack around a lack of first class functions and/or closures?<p>Not in general. In Ruby the case is more complex because Ruby blows, but if you take Smalltalk's blocks they implement closures (in Dolphin, they're instances of `BlockClosure`) and they're first-class functions.<p>The way in which colloquial ""blocks"" differ from ""lambdas"" first-class functions is control flow in the semantics of return: lambdas use local returns, a `return` will break from the current dynamic scope (discarding the current stack frame), whereas blocks use non-local returns: a `return` will break from an enclosing <i>lexical</i> scope (generally a method and you can't nest methods).<p>You could very well have both behaviors with the same function type, using different return operators (yehuda is full of crap when he asserts that you need both lambdas and blocks by the way, even more so since Smalltalk did not have lambdas: Smalltalk has methods and blocks, methods are <i>not</i> lambdas as they can't be anonymous or nested, they're a top-level construct of the class) just as you can already emulate non-local returns via exceptions today (that's basically what a non-local return is)",1326221880

3448384,comment,3446979,3447903,2,0,tzs,,,"I don't think anyone dropped the claim that Apple was a distributor. I don't see any way to make any kind of rational argument under US copyright law that they are not a distributor.<p>The question was whether or not they needed permission of the copyright holder of the GPL code in order to distribute. Contrary to widespread believe, distribution does not always require permission.<p>For instance, if you buy from Best Buy or Amazon a router that contains Linux firmware, then Best Buy or Amazon has in fact distributed Linux to you. Yet they have no obligation whatsoever to provide you with source code, or point you to where you can get it.<p>That's because the copies they are distributing are copies they got from the router manufacturer. Amazon and Best Buy are not making copies of their own for distribution, or modifying the copies they receive form the router maker before selling the router. They are just passing the copies through.<p>That puts them squarely under a section of copyright law called the ""First Sale Doctrine"" which basically says that the copyright owner's right to control distribution does not extend to individual copies that were legitimately distributed with permission of the copyright owner.<p>So, if Amazon or Best Buy wanted to make you agree to GPL incompatible terms for items you bought from them, there would be no problem. They could continue to sell Linux routers.<p>Compare to the App Store. Apple receives one copy from the developer. When a sale is made, Apple makes a new copy from that and distributes that new copy. That's the first distribution of that particular copy, and so does not benefit from the First Sale Doctrine.",1326221770

Working on Project Euler helps build those fundamentals, writing code comfortably during your interview helps show your fundamentals. In terms of presentation, I didn't feel like he was doing 'window dressing', you definitely want to show your interests, projects and your opinions, these are part of the fundamentals.<p>No matter what, there is always a base line of presentation that you must meet in an interview to show your fundamentals.

Thats easy in JavaScript. Heres a block:<p><pre><code>  if (foo === bar)

But then those rates are jacked up an average of 30% to 50% to make up for money that hospitals lose in treating patients who dont have private insurance - which is the majority of them. So to make up the difference, they overcharge patients who are insured. This practice is called cost-shifting. In a typical hospital, upward of half the patients are covered by Medicare and Medicaid - neither of which pays the full cost of treatment. Another 10% to 15% of patients are uninsured; maybe they can afford to pay, but more likely theyre broke and cant cover their bills either.

He desperately wants JS to be his blub (ruby) and doesn't seriously think about how to accomplish his goals with what the language provides.<p>> There are two very common problems here. First, this has changed contexts. We can fix this by allowing a binding as a second parameter, but it means that we need to make sure that every time we refactor to a lambda we make sure to accept a binding parameter and pass it in. The var self = this pattern emerged in JavaScript primarily because of the lack of correspondence.<p><i>Or</i>, you could use Function.prototype.bind where it's needed. Only functions where an execution context is frequently provided should accept an execution context (as sugar, basically), and it's generally better to assume prudent use of bind(). But I guess I'm crazy.<p>He then proposes a wholesale change to function semantics in the language. There are no ""acrobatics"" performed if you want to return a value passed to forEach(). You just enclose a variable and assign from within the callback. Any experienced JS dev will tell you that the disadvantage of forEach() and relatives is <i>not</i> that you can't easily return, but rather, that you can't easily <i>break</i>. However, proponents of a functional style would argue that you should be filtering your list first so that you only have to deal with interesting values, and so that there is no need to break: If you need `break`, use for ()!<p>I mean, come on, this is the same guy who wrote a reopenClass function in Ember.js -- for a language with plainly open prototypes.<p>This is nothing but a post glorifying Ruby and bashing JS for not being Ruby.

Fixing this will get you much more market share.<p>* All of the above doesn't mean Cfengine can't handle n-th order complexity and diversity.  Instead what I am suggesting is to make it very easy to try on in the simplest cases, and wear well with experience and age in tougher environments.<p>* Some simple config enumerator scripts.  Run yum, dpkg, etc and get a list of all packages.  Output this into a config file that the user can edit and put into use right away.<p>I'll dig through your Cfengine examples some time and see how it's going.",1326219615

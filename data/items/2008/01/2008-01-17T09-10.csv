Like one on the east coast, one on the west coast, one in Europe, and you don't care about the rest of the world. But I am not sure Justin.tv has that.",1200563868

(Rosling is a professor in public health)<p>As for human rights, it is important for producing creative work.  However, the nature of creative work is that the results are indirect and unpredictable, and the benefits are usually spread beyond economic boundaries, which don't address the immediate needs of the poorer developing countries.",1200563242

Any ideas on how they plan to earn a billion dollars with MySQL? I thought what most open source companies do is sell consulting from time to time (help us set up our MySQL server), is that really such a big market?",1200562785
99711,comment,99595,99595,0,0,axod,,,"My understanding of a CDN was:<p>You build your own geographically diverse network. Servers in each country/state/area. You put in very high speed links between each node.<p>When a user comes to get something from you, you redirect them to the node that is closest to them (Either geographically, or in terms of hops/ping time).<p>Is this not what CDN means typically?",1200562346

For an example, check out <a href=""http://www.flippr.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flippr.net/</a> for a Flickr clone that was built in a weekend.<p>To a great extent, Drupal can be seen as a point-and-click website development kit. Assembling pieces like like the image, watermark, lightbox and other modules like postcard and image notes can provide the pieces you're looking for. Being modular in design, this installation of Drupal could start its life as a simple image gallery but later grow to become a full website with features like an OpenID provider, BitTorrent tracker, Digg-like voting, etc.<p>There's also excellent Menalto Gallery2 integration, but Gallery2 may or may not be what you're looking for.",1200561354

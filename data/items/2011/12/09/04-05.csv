As an aside, I think the key is to make sure the bully is actually <i>right</i> about what they're bullying.<p>For example both Gnome (via Gnome Shell) and Ubuntu (via Unity) have already realized that they need to be bullies to see through their grand new UI visions.  That much can be inferred by how both projects are interacting with the community and the complaints/praise it generates.<p>But in my opinion though, the bullies behind both Gnome Shell and Unity are objectively wrong in many of their design decisions, and as a result both products are deeply and perhaps even irreversibly flawed.  Unfortunately, a bully by definition must continue bullying, damn the torpedoes; and that's how we end up with products that cause such a deep rift in the community, when in fact the opposite--majority praise at how things have improved--should be happening.<p>Bullies are essential to good UI.

A mobile app could do some pretty cool stuff, say you purchase an itinerary and it is pushed to your phone, you could do on location things like offer special discounts from vendors as well as location aware items like restaurant review integration from yelp or urban spoon, etc.<p>Taking it to a mobile platform as opposed to or in addition to a PDF opens a world of revenue opportunities as well as makes for a better overall user experience.<p>You should take a look at my profile, I have done a lot of travel related stuff and exited a few start-ups in the space. If you guys ever want to chat, I can offer you guys some good advice on how to position your app<p>. As well, please take this with a grain of salt, but you guys need to get a graphic artist, pictures sell travel and they need to be great, a travel brochure should wow people and get them excited about the destination. Design is so critical in travel.<p>Also 70% of travel related decisions by couples are made by the woman. Remember that statistic when your designer works on the site, you should try to remain neutral in design, but if you cannot, lean toward more feminine qualities, soft curves, lighter colors. Images of attractive women do not drive away women, but they will up your male conversion rate. A masculine young male can reduce your conversion (in heterosexual markets), try to employ images of couples with an older attractive male and a younger attractive female.\nEnsure that they are tasteful but employ them as people like to see attractive people having fun.

Story may or may not be true. Reference links included.<p>A few details about Iran, I personally consider established:<p>* Iran is not 'trying to produce nuclear weapons', as endlessly claimed by Israel/USA. Because Iran already possesses nuclear weapons, and has since the mid '90s. They bought a dozen or so from one of the ex-Soviet states, and probably more since.\nIsrael and USA governments know this. It is the sole reason Iran has not so far been attacked by Israel/USA. Fear of retaliation. If the Zionist entity could ever be sure they knew the location of all Iranian nukes, they'd attack within minutes.<p>* All the talk of 'Iranian nuclear weapons development' is Orwell-speak code, for the _real_ reason the Zionists loathe Iran's fully legal, peaceful nuclear power program. This is because Iran is refining Uranium fuel for their reactor. Also legal under international law. But... the byproduct is Depleted Uranium. Which may be used to produce DU anti-armor penetrating shells. There has never been an instance of Zionist armed forces (NATO, Isreal, USA, etc) facing on the battlefield an opponent possessing DU shells. That asymmetry is NATO's SOLE battlefield advantage. They are totally terrified of finding themselves in a real fight without that advantage.<p>* Iran is not the aggressor. Iran has NEVER been an aggressor. The true villains in this stand-off are Israel and their insane, megalomaniac 'Eretz Israel' expansionist ambition. With the USA as a politically captive thug acting on behalf of Israel.<p>I'm cheering for the Iranians. And I'm quite able to accept that the Zionists would be preparing to launch an unprovoked biological warfare attack on Iran. It's exactly the kind of thing Israel and the USA governments would do.<p>Here's hoping there's a Second American Revolution before these lunatics can start WWIII.<p>But I'm not very hopeful.",1323404121

Apple is, to a degree, insulated from competition, since you can&#x27;t buy a cheap equivalent from a competitor that runs the same OS and apps as your current phone.<p>I&#x27;d also question whether every device sold by Samsung and the other &quot;premium&quot; Android developers you mention, could be considered &quot;premium&quot;.<p>Certainly there&#x27;s a lot of Samsung devices that are aimed further downmarket than some of those from Xiaomi or Huawei (and vice versa). And even within a single manufacturer, you&#x27;ve not presented any evidence to suggest that people haven&#x27;t shifted from non-premium Samsung to premium Samsung.

If they&#x27;re a pure instructor, they have three or four other classes to teach, papers to grade, etc.  If they&#x27;re a researcher, they&#x27;ve got maybe another class or two and a strong obligation to produce world-class research, or else their teaching load will go up...<p>The other issue is that presentations with shiny graphics probably aren&#x27;t the best way to teach, either!  I can give the best lecture or presentation in the world and still have a room full of students who couldn&#x27;t reproduce even a tiny bit of it.  The reason for the slow pace of lectures is to break up material into small, reproducible bits: we want students to understand the ins-and-outs of the cross-product, rather than just leave it as another wikipedia link to follow when there&#x27;s time later (ie, never).  That said, good course design will have some &#x27;overarching themes&#x27; or big examples that are returned to time and time again, filling out more details as students have more depth of knowledge.

Now, we close a customer worth $500/month, but he pays annually, so we granted him a 1 month discount ($500x11=$5,500). Do we now:<p>- add the discounted $5,500/12 = $458.33 to the MRR - add $550 to the MRR (because that&#x27;s the plan the customer is on) - add $5500 to the current month&#x27;s MRR - leave the MRR untouched<p>We used to go with the first solution (as it seems* the most &quot;fiscally conservative&quot;), but the problem is that we have a huge number of customers paying annually (roughly 80%), and our MRR does not account for that. So we report $10,000 MRR, but there will be only coming $2,000 actual bucks in the next month, because all the other customers are on annual plans (and that revenue may already be spent etc.). Makes calculating a burn rate and reporting to investors difficult.

Probably in the context of nuclear weapons being perceived as making their services obsolete (a mistake that took the bloody Korean War to start correcting, but before that see e.g. The Revolt of the Admirals)?<p>As for Sakhalin, it was an invasion of the southern half of the island.  The USSR used an amphibious landing of a rifle brigade and a marine battalion in the effort, that&#x27;s not the same thing as landing 100K, and the rest of the islands the took were quite small.  Could they have taken a fair amount, or maybe even all of Hokkaido?  Very possibly, but this is not hardly the same sort of thing as occupying Eastern Europe.  Today the island has 4% of the total Japanese population; due to it having 1/4th of the home islands&#x27; arable land, I&#x27;d assume it was larger in proportion back then, but compared to grabbing most of what was traditionally &quot;Germany&quot;, with a very long land border, plus almost all of Eastern Europe (does Austria count as part of it)?<p>Anyway, your thesis rests on the assumption our end of WWII leadership, ridden as it was with Soviet agents, was so bloody minded they&#x27;d casually slaughter 10s of thousands of Japanese merely to decrease Soviet influence in East Asia.<p>An extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary proof when the simpler explanation works so well.  That the two atomic bombs ended up saving even more Japanese lives, 250,000 civilian lives per month in the rest of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, and 10s of thousands of Allied military that would have been lost in the invasions.<p>The only debatable point I see here is that of unconditional surrender, which after WWI, after, as Tom Lehrer put it &quot;<i>We taught them a lesson in 1918.

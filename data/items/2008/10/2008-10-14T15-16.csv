332289,comment,332098,332215,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I know, I almost bought a current-gen MacBook off someone I know, with the intention of replacing the built-in 80GB drive with a brand new 500GB one, but decided to wait out this new release. The new ones are rumoured to have 160-250GB of disk space, and if past experience is anything to go by, getting bigger disks from Apple is going to be a ripoff.<p>The store site is down right now, but I vaguely remember the upgrade to 320GB being of the order of a brand new 500GB drive (~€125), if you fit one of those yourself you end up with a spare drive as well of course. Plus, being able to replace it yourself within the space of a couple minutes in case it fails is worth a lot to me too.",1223999090

This could solve the cheaper part, and make it even more powerful at the same time. However, I don't know how hard it is to program reconfigurable computers.<p>FYI: Reconfigurable computing is like parallel computing, but instead of running all of the threads on commodity hardware, they are each dynamically implemented on a FPGA. This makes a super computer with thousands of simultaneous processes much cheaper, and take far less space, if you can program the system.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconfigurable_computing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconfigurable_computing</a><p>Wikipedia says that reconfigurable computing systems commonly increase speed 4 orders of magnitude and decrease power consumption by one order of magnitude. (that's right, order of magnitude) However, this is in spite of the fact that FPGAs are behind commodity hardware by almost the same amount.

It's not Latin, but people still viciously cling to it.<p>Wherever there is a misunderstanding between two different sides, the defensive cry ""straw man!"" is heard either to compensate for a lack of ability (or motivation) to explain a point of view or to willfully ignore obvious implications of an argument.<p>If you look hard enough, you can find a straw man in almost every argument. Although it's important to find these misinterpretations and correct them, it usually does no good to yell ""straw man!"" at the other guy as part of your rebuttal.<p>There are some cases where a straw man argument is purposely used, usually to attack someone else's beliefs or philosophy, and therefore I think it's appropriate to bring up that term (if you're up to feeding trolls).<p>Next time you feel like reaching for your ""straw man"" defense, try to understand how and why you may have been misinterpreted, and take the opportunity to explain yourself better.",1227661096

377082,comment,376669,377054,0,0,karjaluoto,,,"Agreed. I think it's something to do with the definitive seeming nature of lists, coupled with the need to keep them succinct that's appealing to many. (That being said, I'm of the generation that was excited to watch the top 20 countdown on MTV in the eighties.) We too would like to see more content on the pages, in part to add to how much readers can get from a topic; additionally, it would be great to get the density up for SEO.<p>The challenge for us is to find a way to collect this content, while appreciating the fact that many users don't want to do much more than click a single button. (I still appreciate what the folks at “Hot or Not” did by reducing the entire site to a one click navigation system.)<p>As such, our first approach was to reduce the barriers to entry, by cutting things out. In fact, our first iterations of the site had relatively exhaustive voting and content options. We found that most people avoided voting altogether as a result, or skipped adding the content. As such, we kept removing things and refining them until we found that people felt it was easy to click on something. (It seems that once the user now partakes in even a single list, they find that it relatively easy and as such start to get involved in others.)<p>We're now looking at how to include extended content, and our approach is to center this on the individual. They can list their thoughts on selections, and then maintain an area for themselves alone. As such, they can make relatively personal explanations for their selections, while still being able to include the community in their list. (We're hoping to roll this out early next week.)<p>We're looking at retooling our points system in tandem with this roll-out. In our minds, it would seem appropriate to reward those who add more content and thoughtful reviews of things. In the meanwhile, this leads us to eventually adding local components that would allow for more in-depth reviews of restaurants and the like.<p>So much to do!",1227660941

377040,comment,376820,376820,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"His basic argument holds truth though, there are pornographic elements in most created works, i.e. elements created strictly to gratify or comfort the reader in some specific way. This is why we instinctually pigeonhole and look down upon genre fiction writers, because their primary task is to comfort the reader, not to challenge or engage in a dialogue with him.<p>Let's break down the different genre's and see what belief systems they seek to gratify.  Feel free to add your own:<p>1. Detective Novels - Sherlock Holmes is fun to read because his adventures take place in an environment in which the details of a man's appearance, speech etc. can predict with 100% accuracy his psychology and plans.<p>2.  Horror novels - Many horror novels play on our desire to believe that we can overcome ""the other"" through some human act.  In Dracula, for instance, the vampire is defeated by meticulous planning, organizing, and above all else, the sharing of information.  Modernity vanquishes the old world scourge.  For people who get off on organization, that novel tweaks your pleasure sensors left and right.<p>3.  Science Fiction - Depends a bit on the sub-genre.  Hard science fiction offers scenarios in which numbers and logic reign supreme. Softer science fiction, a la Star Wars, is often really just fantasy in another cloak...<p>4.  Fantasy - Fantasy gratifies our desire to believe that those passing, semi-eccentric thoughts we all harbor from time to time, are really the laws that govern the world. Wish-fulfillment narratives are really just the exploration of ideas that pop into everyone's head from time to time.<p>To put it in hacker terms, works of genre fiction create systems where the requirements never change. Much like video games, the rules are set in place early on and strictly adhered to.  This is immensely comforting.  On a personal note: it's also fairly disturbing.  For about 20 years now, my mother has more or less read a book a day or so, from cover to cover.  She has a full-time job (teacher) and was always around to do mom stuff when I was a kid, but she spends her nights up reading.  One could argue that this is awesome, but it's not.  Because she's reading genre fiction.<p>She gets the latest romance novels every Wednesday and has them finished by Sunday. That leaves her two days to work through other genres.  A few years back, her Monday-Tuesday books were gay Vampire romance novels.  Before that it was detective novels.  Every time I visit, it's some new sub-genre I've never heard of.<p>We're all entitled to our quirks and interests, but I would argue that what she is doing is self-medicative and produces no other value.  She never has anything to SAY about these books.  They prompt no insights into life.  She never wants to talk about them with us when we try to engage.<p>And I think that's what this article is getting at, tracing out this masturbatory impulse in an oft-praised work.  We need to be aware of this stuff so we can appreciate and steer clear of it when we don't want it.<p>Now, I would argue that the best genre fiction can and often does create social good beyond medicating sad, frustrated people.  The Harry Potter books created community and sparked copycats.  That's more or less good.  The Star Wars films stoked a lot of imaginative response and prompted a lot of people to make interesting films.  That's good too.  The trouble is the books that are meant to be held in.",1227658327

This assumes I am wrong, otherwise you would have agreed with me because there's no logic in presenting a rebuttal to an argument based on nonexistent data (hence the ""logical fallacy"" part).<p>The phrase ""If you had children..."" is always either a case of Bulverism or simple platitude; irrelevant either way. And given the number of times I've heard it, we should probably all be glad I <i>don't</i> have children ;)",1227657749

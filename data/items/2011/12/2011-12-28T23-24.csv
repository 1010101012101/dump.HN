3401962,comment,3401706,3401802,1,0,dr3wster,,,"This is very true, but my main issue was my phone receiving a delivery confirmation when the recipient never actually received the message.  That seems like unacceptable behavior to me.  Assuming the messages are IDed in some way, why can't phone A just keep sending message 1 to phone B until it receives a confirmation for message 1 from phone B? And phone B can just ignore any duplicate message 1's and send back confirmations for them anyway.<p>Obviously this becomes a very complex problem over a large scale, but I feel like Apple can do better than this.",1325116697

You can see it most days here ... a story will go from the HN front page to the tech blog's front page so it can circle back to HN's front page.<p>I really don't think they've even come close to a golden age of tech blogging - Engadget summarizing a blog that was summarizing a blog that was summarizing a blog that was summarizing a blog that was summarizing a blog, with the entire chain of copy/paste journalists doing their best not to leak traffic to sources or external sites, and then AOL making that official policy, and then the rest of the blogosphere copying them, is probably not the best they can do.",1325116637

If you opened 3.3 million letters from my mail box, you'd probably be the first person to live the remainder of their life in jail for mail tampering... regardless of your age.<p>My mail is stored in an easily accessible box at the end of my driveway. If it has <i>any</i> form of lock, you're committing a much more serious crime. When you're hacking into a passworded system to steal email, your crime should be treated with just severity. Not only should it be regarded as committing a federal crime, but there should be charges for breaking the lock too (I'm against the DMCA's whole copyright circumvention bullshit, because it hurts the little guy. But no protection against email fraud hurts the little guy.)<p>> If you fail to lock your door, you are in effect allowing this possibility. If you communicate over a ""clear"" channel, without taking steps to encrypt that data, you are again allowing this. That's why I don't view this as a valid moral claim.<p>If I fail to lock my door, it's still immoral to enter my property and steal everything. Just as it's immoral to enter my unlockable mailbox and steal my mail. If you don't find it immoral for someone else to read your mail then honestly you should have no qualms with posting the entire contents of all your email addresses online for us to scrutinize as well.<p>If there's no immorality about stealing a corporations emails, containing hundreds or thousands of peoples personal emails and information then you should have no morality problems about HN trawling your own emails.<p>Regardless of if I lock my door or not, I have a right not to have my property looted. Regardless of if I use a strong or weak password for my email, I have the right to not have my property looted.<p>My problem with this world is people like you, who will be the first to scream fucking murder when some trivial wrong happens to you but you claim everyone else has no moral claim for not doing everything you deem appropriate. Get off your fucking high horse and learn the god damn definition of morals because at least knowing the definition might help you find a set.<p>I'm giving myself a 99% chance of being down voted, but put your money where your mouth is.

3401953,comment,3400577,3400577,6,0,fapi1974,,,"I thought I'd put in a note about my experience with a comparable program in Singapore called iJam.  A very similar thing, though at the time it didn't include office space or travel expenses - basically a government managed micro-grant of $30,000, repayable only if you make $2MM in revenue.<p>I was also very frustrated by the amount of bureaucracy and the difficulty in getting payments - much of the time whether or not payments made it through was based on personal relationships.  In fact at one point our payments were suspended simply because one of the advisors on the review committee didn't like us.  In the end we got our cash - but lost a lot of time and ultimately didn't find it to be worth it.  A better approach for us would have been to find a supportive early investor.<p>However, all of that said - even in Singapore, with its reputation for completely clean government - the program was riddled with conflicts of interest, double dipping, and other problems that led to a fair bit of controversy.  So I understand the need to put stricter controls on how the money is doled out.<p>Net - this isn't so much about Chile, but rather about governments trying to be investors - they can't move quickly, they are not profit motivated, and they tend to rely on relationships rather than merit in the absence of clear guidelines.<p>I'm hopeful that the Chileans will figure out a clean set of rules that apply to everyone equally which will make equitable the tradeoffs between the free money and the pain of dealing with some bureaucracy.",1325116447

They aren't.<p>Oh, thanks so much, jonhendry! I really appreciate your filling me in. Reading <i>America's Secret War</i>, by Stratfor's founder, had left me entirely in the dark about their mission and capabilities until this very moment. I stand enlightened.<p>The fact remains, the sort of person who is emailing high-level folk at Stratfor either knows things or wants to know things of geopolitical importance. A source with a compelling piece of data the public doesn't know about, perhaps. Or a business tycoon with a question that, knowing it was asked, completely invalidates the public narrative that company had spun.<p>So if your mission is to get access to data about how people are running the world, a great place to start is a private global intelligence firm.<p>No one is saying they're not <i>allowed</i> to do what they're doing.

Your baseless slander of tens of thousands was because someone had said we should join forces with them. No problem then.<p>> You still haven't explained how I'm a murderer by proxy and you aren't.<p>I didn't say I'm not.

Perhaps they even are (or rather, the needless police presence is...). But any society pursing a baseless war needs to be drained of its resources before it can use them to kill more innocent people.<p>> So what gives you the right to call me a murderer by proxy?<p>Huh? What gives me the right to call you something?<p>Rather, what do you think removes my right to call you something?<p>> ... but how would you know if I did?<p>You'd have said so.

For instance you'd have commented that the racist motivations they had and the armed forces' willingness to recruit them despite this (because of?) was the reason why you couldn't support them regardless of their superficial motivations such as ""justice"".<p>> Does that mean you are by proxy guilty of everything that's happened in the Occupy camps that you defend?<p>Did I defend blanket-defend Occupy?

It was a life-changing experience for my girlfriend who now wants to start her own business instead of working for someone else. And it took away a lot of the drudgery of starting up a company. We got the chance to live in a great apartment with a view of the Andes, eat well, socialize with many smart people, and even travel to places like San Pedro de Atacama to see the stars.<p>The recurring complaints you'll read are from people trying to spend the absolute minimum and running into problems. They are honest and thus reasonable, but without explicit numbers it is also hard to put them in perspective and judge the program. I think most participants will be very upfront in telling applicants they need to plan to spend more than 4k to take full advantage of the program. In our case we needed to submit around 7-8k in expenses to get the total 42k grant over about nine months. But if this is bullshit I would like to signup for more of it. My costs are at least 3k a month outside Chile. 1k a month is nothing. For teams of 2-3 people to complain about that given all of the advantages strikes me as lacking in perspective.<p>As far as the availability of funding, I know more people who have taken funding in Chile than have taken it in China where my business is ostensibly based. That said, the point of Startup Chile is not that you are promised future funding or that Chilean VCs offer great valuations (I had very little contact with them beyond some unsolicited emails). That seems to be a very American thing as with YC and TechStars. The point is that you DO NOT GIVE UP EQUITY during a period of high uncertainty while you iterate towards product-market fit.

3401894,comment,3400508,3401449,1,0,jrockway,,,"I think the most important thing you can do are long cardio sessions.  3-6 hours at low intensity.  This is what trains your body to burn fat, because your body learns that it does not need fast energy.<p>If you do a daily 1-2 hour bike ride at moderate intensity (which many people do), that's nice, but it doesn't increase your fitness past a certain point or burn much fat.  You just deplete your glycogen stores (about 1600 calories worth) which your next couple meals replenish.   (I know because I have done this for many years and my speed does not increase unless I became way out of shape for some reason.  You become fit enough to do your normal ride and that's as far as you go unless you add intervals or time.)<p>Short interval sessions at VO2max, as you suggest, are definitely good for you (feel those endorphins!), but they don't train your body to burn fat, they train your circulatory system to remove lactate.  This is good if you are a bicycle racer or a marathon runner, but largely useless if you are trying to lose weight.  (I know because I've done running and cycling intervals for a couple years and have weighed the same the entire time.  More speed at the same heart rate, though, but I wish I had a power meter to really measure the effect of interval training.)<p>Anyway, my advice would be to go for a 3 hour walk on Saturday afternoon.  Get a heart rate monitor to ensure that you're in your aerobic zone while doing so.  If you want to be a bike racer or marathon runner or triathlete, then do interval training (and buy a book about it, and get a trainer).  But for ""normal people"" that want to do something other than watch TV, it's not the best use of your time.<p>As for diet, processed foods are not the problem.  Yes, they taste bad and are devices for evil corporations to make extra money at your expense.  Avoid them for that reason, not because they are making you fat.  You get fat because you eat more calories than your body needs, not because you eat sugar.  It's just that it's very easy to eat a lot of calories worth of sugar without feeling full, and so you eat way more than your body needs.<p>I haven't been very successful with weight loss because I haven't followed two of my rules.  I didn't start weekly long cardio sessions until last week, and I still haven't quite found the ideal diet for myself.  Interval training with running and cycling have kept me in pretty darn good shape, but I still have a lot of excess fat.  (I need to add weightlifting to my regimen also, but only because I want the core and arm strength, not because I think I'm going to lose any weight.)",1325115356

It takes 15 minutes for your body to realize it's full.  Fast food chains encourage you to eat a lot of calories in a short period of time; it's what they advertise and it's the kind of product they deliver.  This means that if you eat fast food, you are going to eat many more calories than you ""want"" before you realize you're satiated.  If you take a McDonald's meal and turn it into a regular-sized meal with respect to calories, it's unlikely that you are going to get fat.  Similarly, if you eat 2000 calories of spinach in one sitting times three meals a day every day, you're going to get fat.

3401843,comment,3400508,3401743,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"One other point I'd been meaning to make.  Not specific to your comments, but this is as good a place as any to add it.<p>Diet, strength training, cardio, sleep, and stress management are largely tools for influencing the endocrine system endogenously (by stimulating natural endocrine responses), rather than exogenously (through direct hormone supplementation).<p>Through diet, you can regulate your insulin/glucagon and leptin/ghrelin cycles, as well as the longer-term IGF cycle.  Short-term, insulin is anabolic (which is why you eat carbs after strength training), long-term, it's lipogenic.  This will have strong impacts especially on body fat, but also (timed correctly) on muscle development.<p>Through strength training you can influence testosterone and HGH production. The latter particularly if you're getting sufficient sleep, generally over 8 hours/night.  Adequate sleep will also reduce cortisol (stress hormone) production, as will other stress-management techniques (avoidance, acceptance, meditation), which again affects body fat and muscle catabolism (breakdown).<p>Cardio activity also has influences on insulin and stress levels.<p>The five methods give you a pretty good means to adjust, again, endogenously, some very powerful influencers of your body's regulatory mechanisms.<p>The other side of physical activity is that it's strongly trained into your neurological system.  It's nerves that carry the impulses to move muscles, and both heavy lifting and fine motor control will exercise different parts of the nervous system, with carryover in both cases to improved brain function.  Strength training, music playing, painting, dance, ballet, gymnastics, balancing a 12"" racing shell, learning foreign languages, problem-solving:  all work different parts of your neurological system.  Done for too long, any can be fatiguing, but as a regular exercise, they'll expand your capacity to do similar activity, and add improved resiliance all around.",1325114221

3401838,comment,3394789,3401105,2,0,wnight,,,"> Let me state the point very concisely and maybe you'll find you actually agree with me:<p>> The GoDaddy stories have become repetitive and unproductive. The stories have been polluted with misinformation and false assumptions. We've said all there is to say and this is distracting us from stopping this bill from passing. Boycotting them is a great way to protest but let's talk about some other things we can do like we had been doing before the GoDaddy story broke.<p>I somewhat agree. But the reason I was nitpicking is because those details matter.<p>GoDaddy isn't blameless. In fact, while they didn't write specific exemptions for themselves they did tweak it for their own good (undoubtedly). If they merely get spanked a bit they'll be back to business as usual in a few weeks and will continue supporting SOPA even if quietly. If they get put out of business and every employee above janitorial is black-listed unless they specifically renounce SOPA and the GoDaddy leaders then future companies will be less willing to try this and future employees will be more willing to leave instead of trotting out ""but then who'd feed my kids?"" excuses. That sort of fear might actually change things.<p>In fact, I think we don't stand a chance in hell of stopping SOPA in the big picture. If we do stop this specific bill they'll reintroduce it with a kiddy-porn focus and we'll all be monsters for daring to speak out against it.<p>In the end our only hope is uncensorable technologies because as long as any group is in control of communications technologies they'll find a need to censor and limit them. Fighting SOPA seems to me like as much of a waste of time as fighting GoDaddy does to you.<p>But if we could exact real, lasting, damage to some of its supporters it would be harder for this sort of thing to be done again.<p>> Hasn't the GoDaddy story played itself out?<p>Does the CEO still get paid? If so, no.<p>> What I'm saying is that it seems like we're focusing so narrowly on one SOPA related story and missing the larger picture.<p>Some of us, yes. Others, no. Why don't you stop exhorting others to do what you want, stop contributing to the noise, and go attack the bigger picture in your own way. Then you'd have something to post to HN and you might win supporters away from the GoDaddy hate-fest where you could never chase them away.",1325114070

On some level its a crap shoot, and marriage is about learning to love whom they become. Hopefully that plays out on both sides of the coin (each spouse continues to love whom the other becomes).  \n2) &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot; marriage mostly has to do with how people fight/interact (see stuff by John Gottman). People will always fight over money, kids, laundry duties etc, but their satisfaction in the relationship will have more to do with how they fight, than what they fight over. \n3) Individuals have total control over whom they fall in love with.

There is a very critical distinction between a library/module and a command-line wrapper. Your programming language probably has a module that exposes the imagemagick API. However, this doesn&#x27;t mean that it uses shell commands for anything; it just exposes the functions to your programming language of choice.<p>I wrote the backend and processing system for a website[1] that deals with converting files, and incidentally uses imagemagick and ffmpeg, amongst other things. You&#x27;ll notice that everything that that calls external programs is handled very carefully. One example of this careful handling is that all of the commands that can be executed are in a single file[2], and very easy to think about. Compare that to OP&#x27;s software, where there are multiple commands scattered across different files. Also, although this is a bit harder to see superficially, but no HTTP request triggers any external program call directly. This is by design.<p>Coming back to your question,<p>>Genuinely curious, how would you implement something like a cron web interface? Certainly it would require you to have a program execute a shell command upon some HTTP request.<p>You set up a cron job[3] that gathers the data and stores it somewhere like a database, or even a file.

In Denmark, you can be born on the lower end of society, and end up as one of the country&#x27;s elites, with greater probability than is the case in the US.

It seems like the implication is that it&#x27;s better that these engineering yuppies not live in San Fran.

How, under any reasonable interpretation, is it a negative for an upper-middle class young engineer-types, to choose to live in San Fran - pay San Fran property taxes, support local business by living and spending money in the area, as opposed to not. Your interpretation is insanity. Furthermore, you&#x27;ve got it all backwards as I&#x27;ve said. Those commuting San Fran engineers are paying municipal taxes. They are contributing to that city. They aren&#x27;t contributing to Mountain View. They are a drag on that city. Every San Fran engineer is a drag on Mountain View, if anything. But that&#x27;s why cities exist. To provide services like that because you&#x27;re all part of the same fuckin country and the same fuckin state and the same fuckin region, and you&#x27;re treating it like some sort of fuckin theft is happening from those foreigners 40 minutes away.

If we were to jump back 6 or 8 years ago, most of us would want to work for google because of their whole &quot;not being evil&quot; schtick, as well as the amazing campus and all the money. But with every little thing that happens, when you realise that Google (like a lot of companies, granted) is in it for the money, one might become a bit less excited.<p>I think a decent amount of good software engineers has a fairly strong ethical code, and would rather not make deals with the devil. Some companies (Google was one of them) seemed to make their deal about making the best services in the long term, and not about making things about money.<p>I remember watching a talk about the history of OpenSolaris. Including the absolutely mythical phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t make the mistake of anthropomorphising Larry Ellison.&quot;(<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc#t=2298"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc#t=2298</a>)\nBut after that comment he goes into the very sad details of how OpenSolaris ended up becoming closed source by Oracle. After this , many many very competent engineers left Oracle almost immediately(within 90 days). The talk is worth listening to (it&#x27;s about 3 minutes after the Ellison jab), and the guy giving the talk gets extremely emotional about it. The power of the social contract with the OSS community was extremely strong.<p>No matter how much money you can give, a lot of people end up following ethical and moral rules. I&#x27;d think Corporate culture is about 75% of software engineer&#x27;s decision of where to work.",1390770452

7126898,comment,7126605,7126870,15,0,_delirium,,,"That&#x27;s a fair criticism. It&#x27;s certainly true that given some assumptions about random income changes, there&#x27;s more mobility in narrower income distributions than wider ones without anything &quot;real&quot; happening. I do think it depends on what the study is trying to show, though, which in part depends on where in the web of arguments and counterarguments in falls.<p>One very common argument I hear from Americans is something like this: it&#x27;s true that (some of) Europe has lower income inequality than the US. However, Europe&#x27;s inequality is more entrenched and hereditary, and therefore actually worse than America&#x27;s in social effects, even though in magnitude it seems less bad. The difference between wealthier and poorer parts of society, this argument goes, is higher in America, but this is not as harmful because the divergence is just based on what you make of yourself and changes generation to generation, rather than being based on rigid notions of class or heredity like in Europe and persisting across generations. So the European rich man might only be 10x as rich as the poor man, while the American one is 100x, but the European has this 10x difference predestined from birth, whereas the American&#x27;s 100x arises only during life.<p>This study seems to show that particular narrative doesn&#x27;t quite go through: the U.S. has a larger class divide <i>and</i> it persists across generations more than Europe&#x27;s smaller class divide does. The second part may well be redundant, as you point out (it might only persist more because it&#x27;s larger), but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make the problem any less bad.",1390770311

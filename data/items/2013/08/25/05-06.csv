6271060,comment,6263205,6266947,3,0,vl,,,">Hard to know why Microsoft stopped developing IE6 and you may be right.<p>Surprisingly little known story: in short MS was afraid of Linux as desktop OS, OSS world was seen as capably of quickly copying any innovative single feature. This is resulted in idea of &quot;integrated innovation&quot;: produce innovation in app development, app framework, data access, communication, os based on it and ship it all at once, so Linux would never catch up (.Net Framework, Avalon - WPF, WinFS, Indigo - WCF, Longhorn). Obviously, plan failed (well, Linux failed to come to desktop too).<p>So IE was seen as done and future to be elsewhere. After IE6 ship with XP, IE team was transformed into Avalon team, consumed bunch of other teams and at it&#x27;s peak Avalon project had something like 500 people working on it (after much struggle and numerous delays it shipped as WPF). So for something like two years, starting at summer of 2001, only 4-6 people worked on IE - IE Sustained Engineering team, patching security vulnerabilities. Then it became obvious that they can&#x27;t keep up and some rearchitecture and refactoring are required in order to fix security problems for real. So IE Security Team was created, and some old timers were transferred from Avalon to do this security fix up, probably around 20 people.<p>Then it became obvious that &quot;integrated innovation&quot; is, in fact, too integrated to ship on time, Avalon and Longhorn are nowhere is sight, and browser war is effectively being lost for the second time to Firefox, of all things (MS management couldn&#x27;t take fork of OSS fork of NN seriously for awhile). So IE Security Team was expanded, became IE7 team and happily started to work on a browser again, 3-4 years too late.<p>>However, the next browser was scheduled to appear with the next OS, which was Vista, which turned into a debacle.<p>As you can see from the story above, initially it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t scheduled to appear at all.",1377409450

6271014,comment,6268635,6268635,1,0,graycat,,,"For the context, that is, computing, the Internet,\nmobile, etc., there is a fundamental problem:  We\nare awash in cheap processor cycles, main memory\nbytes, solid state and rotating disk bytes,\ninfrastructure software, LAN and Internet bandwidth,\nclient devices, sensors, transducers, etc. and for\nmost of these are getting more rapidly.<p>The fundamental problem is what the heck to do of\nhigh value -- change the world size -- with these\nfantastic, cheap resources?<p>Open ocean sailing?  Permitted trading without the\nmany &#x27;tolls&#x27; from long paths across land.<p>Personal cars?  Killed off the horses and passenger\ntrains and opened up suburbia.<p>Trucks?  Killed off a lot of freight trains.<p>Electric lights?  Got rid of lighting by burning\ncandles, whale oil, kerosene, and coal gas.<p>Big stuff.<p>Computing&#x27;s done a lot so far.  The fundamental\nproblem now is, now what?<p>The common assumption is that a big IT company must\nfrequently &#x27;reinvent&#x27; itself and &#x27;create&#x27; its\nfuture.  If so, then the big IT companies -- and\nrelated companies in &#x27;media&#x27;, cars, etc. -- just\nmust successfully address significant parts of this\nfundamental problem.<p>So, the fundamental problem must be (no choice)\nshared by Yahoo, Google, Apple, Facebook, Samsung,\nIntel, AMD, Cisco, Juniper, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM,\nAmazon, newspapers, TV, movies, DARPA, essentially\nall <i>information technology</i> (IT) startups and\nventure capital, etc.<p>Efforts that successfully address significant parts\nare coming forward quite slowly, maybe only a few\nsuch efforts each 10 years.  Not fast enough.<p>Big IT companies, I hate to say it, but a lot of you\nguys stand to go the way of buggy whips if you fail\nsuccessfully to address significant parts of this\nfundamental problem.  So, better set up a group,\nissue thinking caps, and get to work.  Maybe the\nprojects look &#x27;blue sky&#x27;, but at least some of them\nhave to go all the way to revenue, earnings, and big\nchanges in the world.  Gotta be willing to stand\nthere on the sea shore and think &quot;open ocean\nsailing&quot; and, then, make it real, make a lot of\nmoney, and change the world.

So, you have a lot of stock market data.\nNow what?  Envision an investor, see what else they\nneed, and start to provide it.  Yes, there should be\na mobile tie in.<p>Yahoo?  Yes, you have some headline news, maybe some\nof it is entertaining.  What about information that\nis really valuable?  Find some such categories and\nhow to get the information out there.<p>Yahoo?  There&#x27;s lots of stuff on the Internet, and\nrecently at AVC.COM Fred Wilson has been complaining\nthat he doesn&#x27;t know how to find blogs, videos, etc.\nhe wants.  A solution is needed.<p>With just the economic driver, we can go on and on.\nI didn&#x27;t say that it was all easy, but neither was\nBeethoven&#x27;s &#x27;Ninth Symphony&#x27;, and when he wrote it\nhe had been stone deaf for years.<p>Get on it Marissa or be in line for a buggy whip\naward.

If you do the same thing to Mayer, you&#x27;ll create a firestorm; suddenly it&#x27;s sexist and not being fair to her.<p>I like that Musk will &quot;not ... think that detracts&quot;, but Mayer is just figurehead for feminism. It&#x27;s almost a textbook example of objectification.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: as a feminist, I <i>fully agree</i> that it is okay to &quot;openly drool over&quot; sexy people. It&#x27;s important to recognize that the overwhelming majority of us are sexual beings and that sexuality is a significant factor in how we look at people.<p>The problem is when C-style languages are so pervasive that it&#x27;s practically impossible to get a LISP in the door because all people see are the parentheses and not the actual value that the language adds on its own merits. That&#x27;s changing these days, and people like Mayer can be acknowledged proudly on their capabilities as human beings. After all, C is just naturally closer to the operating system, and languages built on top of C are obviously faster. That will tell you all you need to know about the difference between the two language paradigms.<p>It&#x27;s true that stereotypes can fail to completely prevent someone from succeeding if they&#x27;re ambitious enough and determined enough. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that Gates didn&#x27;t take licks for it. Maybe he really didn&#x27;t care. Maybe he did. Short of him actually coming out and saying so, it&#x27;s hard to know. Maybe he lost a deal because he seemed too nerdy and the other person didn&#x27;t tell him and there was no social infrastructure to help put the possibility under consideration. Maybe he had subordinates who couldn&#x27;t stand to take orders from a nerd and ended up walking off when he could have used their help.<p>We can&#x27;t tell, because there hasn&#x27;t been enough scrutiny on the subject, and the amount of data available out of one person&#x27;s career is meaningless. How many entrepreneurs make a pitch to VCs and get laughed out more because they didn&#x27;t dress up than because their idea was terrible? It&#x27;s hard to get that exact estimate. And of course it matters whether or not they dressed up. But <i>why</i> does it matter, and is the fact that it matters okay? Maybe that&#x27;s a social justice fight we&#x27;ll have to have in fifty years or five hundred years.",1377407863

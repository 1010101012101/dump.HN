8423628,comment,8421656,8421656,0,0,d4vlx,,,"I worked on online casino software for several years and we had a number of bugs like this. They would usually involve someone writing a client to hit our API directly and fiddling with the xml messages. The operators would usually catch the issues within hours, turn off the game and often deny the players their winnings, if it was a legitimate win. Several people wound up in jail for exploits.<p>In the early days of the company it was a fairly significant problem with incidents pretty frequently. The lack of QA and a release process really bit them a few times as well. A game was put into production with the result hard coded to a win. Goes to show that just because a company makes software that deals with money and is financially successful it does not mean they are at all competent. It took 9 years for them to turn things around and transform the company into a highly effective dev shop, at least by industry standards. I am proud I was part of that. Unfortunately the industry had some major problems in 2009-2010 and they ended up having to find a buyer who even more unfortunately does not appreciate or understand developers or software development.<p>We did integrations with many other gambling software companies and not a single organization was what I consider competent. I would love to see a new company with serious technical chops break into the world of online gambling and school the crusty behemoths. Hard to do however because of the network effects and importance of reputation and deal making.",1412711951

Just have an app on your NFC phone and have it send the card data over NFC to the card when you want to use it.  In this way you could just have an app on your phone which can work with the bank over the Net to generate throw-away numbers for every transaction.<p>Having any credit card number which you&#x27;ve ever used only usable for one single purchase would make fraud have to change to adapt.  But you could probably sell such a thing easily today with all the recent loss of credit card number news.  Granted, the vendor of such a card has to partner with a bank to enable this feature set, and then only a small number of people will want such a card as it imposes a new workflow for paying for things.",1412711813

I&#x27;d better stop neglecting my duties now!<p>Edit: One thing I forgot to put in there: one reason the closure technique is powerful is that you&#x27;re leveraging the programming language and runtime to do most of the book-keeping for you. Whatever data is handy, you just reference. The system will remember all the references. That&#x27;s why using things like query strings and hidden form fields is more complicated: you have to handle all those details yourself (not to mention serialize and deserialize them if you&#x27;re passing through any other format than what your program keeps in memory). That is tedious, and when your app has many kinds of request, the complexity quickly piles up.<p>Of course there are other abstractions you can build over this, but closures are an elegant one—especially in cases where programming simplicity is more important than scalability, which is most cases.<p>Edit 2: A few people thought this should be its own post, so I made <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8425011"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8425011</a>.<p>[1] Originally <a href=""http://pastebin.com/dETyYtpX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/dETyYtpX</a>, but I added the above bit etc.",1412711689

Most of these are edge cases of passing in invalid data into functions that try to make sense of it, using discouraged functionality (e.g. not using strict-mode or using obscure parts of the language that are only supported for backwards-compatibility) and the rest shows just a complete lack of understanding of the language.<p>One of the &quot;WTFs&quot; is `&quot;true&quot; == true` being false. Double-equals comparison being discouraged aside, the only language in which I would expect that to be true is PHP.

I&#x27;ve dealt with e-ink fairly recently on two projects. They don&#x27;t have a flexible design to sell you beyond prototype. and for custom sizes Their MOQ to begin exploring a custom option is 100K units.<p>2. There is no coil in a charge pump :). They use capacitors and switches. There is no inductor. For a charge pump to drive an eink like screen you need caps of about 10-20uF. I&#x27;ve designed about 3 different boards that drive high-res e-ink screens. You can&#x27;t get those caps below 1mm at the very best.<p>3. Are you sure you are getting 0.2mm PCBs? That is only 8mils thick! Most standard PCBs are 62 mils ~ 1.5mm. Can you tell me who these guys are that would do super thin at prototype prices? I would want to use them (no sarcasm).<p>Minimum IPC thickness for 4 layer board (which is what you need for the EPSON driver to those e-inks) is 12 mils but even at that you&#x27;ll have mechanical problems with that PCB. Credit card thickness FYI is 30 mils = 0.030&quot;.<p>What I would say to these guys is: &quot;show me a prototype with the appropriate thickness. You have a prototype, right?&quot;",1412711654

A tightly constrained color palette provides thematic unity and makes a big contribution to a film&#x27;s &#x27;atmosphere,&#x27; and generally takes precedence over photographic realism. The extreme example of this is making a film in black-and-white for aesthetic reasons; although that&#x27;s a bit extreme for most mainstream audiences, many popular films are almost monochromatic with a strong tint. This creates visual tension and where the plot revolves pretty clearly around heroes and villains, strong visual contrasts underline the moral contrasts of the narrative. Comedies generally have broader colors palettes and colors are more saturated, reflecting the dramatically unpredictable and chaotic interactions of the characters.<p>Anyway, since shooting features on digital media became practical, and high quality digital scans of film stocks became affordable, filmmakers have exerted more and more control over the color of a film Because They Can, and the increasingly minor deficienices of LEDs are that much more likely to be smoothed away in post anyway because the white balance of a scene can be so easily manipulated in the digital realm.",1412711303

In a Curry-Howard-style system, you need to look at the function and figure out when it should be called and what preconditions need to be true for it to work properly. But this is exactly why people like type systems, you can think about programs modularly rather than all at once.",1412709992

For example, income from illegal prostitution is taxable, but associated expenses can not be claimed as a business expense.<p>It&#x27;s complicated and I&#x27;m not a lawyer (and certainly not trained in reading court judgements), but this appears to be not true in all cases. Commissioner v. Tellier [1] seems to say that with some well-defined exceptions (although it doesn&#x27;t appear to go into what those exceptions are), expenses incurred in the development of an illegal business are deductible just like they would be for a legal business. Examples given are paying legal defense fees, and rent and wages paid for a then-illegal gambling operation. So it may well be the case that expenses incurred while developing a career as a prostitute (e.g. phone bills, condoms, advertising, hotel rooms, and travel) could be deductible.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/383/687/case.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/383/687/case.htm...</a><p>edit: Ah, I read a bit deeper and found the exceptions.<p><i>Only where the allowance of a deduction would &quot;frustrate sharply defined national or state policies proscribing particular types of conduct&quot; have we upheld its disallowance [...] Further, the &quot;policies frustrated must be national or state policies evidenced by some governmental declaration of them.&quot; [...] Finally, the &quot;test of nondeductibility always is the severity and immediacy of the frustration resulting from allowance of the deduction.&quot; [...] In that case, as in Hoover Motor Express Co. v. United States,356 U. S. 38, we upheld the disallowance of deductions claimed by taxpayers for fines and penalties imposed upon them for violating state penal statutes; to allow a deduction in those circumstances would have directly and substantially diluted the actual punishment imposed.</i><p>So based on that reading (and again, I&#x27;m not a lawyer), it seems like expenses a prostitute incurs would be absolutely deductible, because disallowing them doesn&#x27;t frustrate the criminalization of the activity.",1412709878

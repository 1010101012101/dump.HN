Sure, but since learning new tools more than superficially means solving problems with them, that is equivalent to:<p><pre><code>  10 Solve problems with tools you know

And learning new tools -- programming languages specifically here -- often involves learning new techniques, that while not necessarily as natural and popular with your current language, can be applied there, which its good to have in your pocket for when the techniques that are most popular/natural with your current languages aren&#x27;t great for solving a problem you run into.<p>There are good reasons that the <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> includes the recommendation to learn a new language every year.",1416865358

You can&#x27;t print over bluetooth--this connectivity is for control of the printer&#x27;s scanning mechanism. It also allows reprogramming or custom exposures. SnapJet uses an analog method of obtaining the image because it simplifies the device electronics and mechanics. This translates to ease of use and yields good picture quality. It also tackles compatibility issues. Compare its function to the impossible instant lab--this is a similar device that uses a larger lens system instead. SnapJet isn&#x27;t meant to function exactly like a traditional printer, but instead as an extension for your smartphone to recreate the fun of Polaroid photography. We&#x27;re also stressing the open source aspect. It&#x27;s a fun gadget that works in a simple way so people can hack and improve upon it.",1416864593

It will take years, no matter what it done. Perhaps longer with legislation due to the speed of government.<p>A slowly rolled out, 5-8 year legislated plan is a lot worse than a slowly ramped up 5-8 year private business competition and proliferation.<p>When businesses compete, the consumer wins. When businesses get regulated but <i>still have no competition</i>, the consumer loses. You seem to be completely glossing over this very important point. We need more competition -- not more regulation.<p>One does not simply regulate their way into competition.<p>> At one time, the USPS did mostly one thing, delivering first class mail and they did it really well, to anywhere in the US for like 10 cents<p>There are realities here you are not addressing. Dramatic increase in gasoline prices -- dramatic decrease in volume of mail, to name a few. This is why the USPS system is struggling today, and the reason they&#x27;ve been allowed to mostly &quot;go private&quot;. The old system was also heavily subsidized by the US Gov&#x27;t, which isn&#x27;t happening anymore.<p>If you look at package mail transport (since only USPS can deliver letters to mailboxes), the competition is fierce between USPS, FedEX and UPS. Often times, UPS/FedEX are a lot cheaper to send a package through. (I know because I work for an distribution company w/ warehouse). We&#x27;ve seen some initiatives from USPS to recapture the package shipment market since they went privatish with their &quot;if it fits, it ships campaign&quot;, but they still have a long ways to go. This is a great example where private companies in competition have way outbeat the regulated portions in the same industry.<p>You&#x27;re &quot;we should regulate today to save tomorrow&quot; attitude holds no water here. Contrary, we should develop today to save tomorrow; develop more competition.",1416862831

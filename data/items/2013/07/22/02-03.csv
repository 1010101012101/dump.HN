6081506,comment,6080052,6081106,2,0,thristian,,,"PostgreSQL is 100% pure MVCC, a little bit like the &quot;SNAPSHOT&quot; method described in the article: updates and deletes always create new copy of a row, and every row has a visibility associated with it: the oldest transaction and the newest transaction that can see that row (if the row hasn&#x27;t been deleted by any currently active transactions, the &#x27;newest transaction&#x27; ID is empty).<p>There are definitely some drawbacks to MVCC. For example, many people are surprised how long &quot;select count(*) from X&quot; takes to run, because it has to do a full table-scan to check which rows the current transaction can actually see. You need to periodically &#x27;vaccuum&#x27; tables, which updates a cached list of which table rows are deleted, so they can be reused by future update (modern Postgres will auto-vacuum, but it&#x27;s another set of knobs for the DBA to tweak). Plus, the storage overhead mentioned by the article (although that really depends on the amount of churn in your particular application, and regular vacuuming keeps it to a minimum).",1374461959

High-pressure steam languished initially because it was extremely risky. Ironically, Watt&#x27;s patents probably encouraged work on high pressure steam because his rivals wanted to work around them.<p>However, it is a really well-written paper that provides fascinating insight into the technological atmosphere of that era, and I highly recommend reading it.<p>BTW, here&#x27;s another paper from the same authors calling out Boldrin & Levine for further fabricating history when the above paper was bought to their attention: <a href=""http://terry.uga.edu/~jlturner/WattAgainAug2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terry.uga.edu/~jlturner/WattAgainAug2009.pdf</a>",1374461921

I still remember exactly how I first felt it; I was six, pondering the universe and mentally zooming into a tear in a wallpaper, down to the subatomic particles level, then I zoomed out, but for the first time didn&#x27;t stop until my mind has encompassed the entire spacetime, the entire, timeless universe, with me but a infinitesimal speck in it. Interestingly though, I quite liked that feeling, in a bit perverse way perhaps; I learned to invoke it almost on demand and did it quite often, especially when I was upset with the world around me. It brought serenity uncomparable to anything else I&#x27;ve experienced, and, at times, welcome detachment. I have recognised it as sad, but it was serene sadness.<p>Years later I&#x27;ve found out that I&#x27;m clinically depressed and perhaps that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t feel the sadness so deeply - it&#x27;s not much lower than my mood set point. BTW, comparing this feeling to the sadness of a close being passing away is like apples and oranges - they both have a completely different flavor to me.<p>I still invoke it from time to time;  for the serenity, sometimes for the detachment, and oddly, sometimes  get sad to get angry and gain some motivation to change the world. I&#x27;ve found that attaining the state is now harder than it was when I was a child.<p>BTW, interesting tip about the poetry; I&#x27;ve been wondering why it&#x27;s not as alluring as it used to be, and perhaps I don&#x27;t spacetime out that often anymore.",1374461883

It&#x27;s not about forcing kids to conform to social norms, it&#x27;s just ensuring they&#x27;re well-rounded enough so that they can make their own choices later in life.<p>My parents sent me to a school where painting, woodworking and handworking (basically knitting, sewing, crocheting) were all mandatory. It pays dividends now because having a background of creativity helps nearly everyone, even plain-jane computer programmers like me. Everyone had to perform in a play every year, no matter how much you didn&#x27;t want to. That helped build confidence and the ability to speak in front of people. Gym and sports and recess are all important too -- no one regrets having <i>too much</i> hand-eye coordination, or the ability to play a pickup game of basketball without making a fool of oneself later in life. It&#x27;s great to be able to relate to and be friends with people who are into sports even if you aren&#x27;t, because the alternative is to politely remove yourself from all those interactions, and that&#x27;s no fun for anyone.<p>I really do think that all kids should play team sports. If it&#x27;s totally obvious that their passion is theater, or computers, or art, or music, or whatever it is, then there&#x27;s no need to try out for the varsity team in high school, but giving kids diverse experiences and making sure they are physically active and aware of their bodies is never a bad thing.",1374461665

Instead, I spent time on my computer and ran around the neighborhood with the kids that lived around me. This is actually another reason why I believe I have a lot of creativity; I came up with new games and things to do for fun instead of working within the barriers of sport.<p>Children should be allowed to be whoever they want to be, and if our education systems cannot support that, there&#x27;s a huge problem.<p>I understand your concern about physical activity, but that&#x27;s something that should be instilled by parents and through health education classes. As children reach their teenage and adult years, they should understand the importance of exercise and well-being, not just that smashing into people on the football field keeps them fit.<p>Like it or not, the world doesn&#x27;t revolve around sports. Some people will enjoy them, and others won&#x27;t. Simple as that. Have you ever thought of, I don&#x27;t know, letting the children decide what they want to do for fun? As I said, playing sports is not a requirement to becoming healthy. Those principles can be taught through different methods. I never played sports, but I still go the gym everyday and feel satisfied after a good workout.",1374461661

BEAM VM is a beautiful thing.<p>Lightweight processes, per process heap, fault isolation, scheduler implementation, iolists.<p>Looking at it after years of dealing with other VMs I find myself nodding my head quite bit saying &quot;Yup, they got this right, aha, got this right too, and so on&quot;<p>Besides Elixir there is also LFE (a lisp flavored Erlang), also JOXA another lisp-like language for BEAM.<p>Other systems usually copy and get inspired by Erlang/BEAM VM but often they pick the concurrency model. The real money is in fault tolerance. They are tied together somewhat, but they are different.<p>As distributed systems grow larger and larger, it is nice if they scale or can parallelize their concurrent parts but they are not going to be practical if they fail. And failure modes of distributed systems are magnitudes worse than single node systems.<p>But it is also hard to sell it. In other words telling developers look this system will isolate fault and you can restart part of it and upgrade it while it runs, is not going to get them inspired unless they are experienced and have been woken up at 3am by a pager when a large system is taken offline because a minor fault wasn&#x27;t properly isolated.

6081474,comment,6078335,6080011,2,0,sparkie,,,"You&#x27;re right, my implication that online posts are not prior art was wrong. I have a negative bias against the patent office from past experience, however it&#x27;s also not a simple as &#x27;an idea being unpatentable as soon as it is described&#x27;.<p>Firstly, a patent doesn&#x27;t cover only an abstract idea, but an abstract implementation of an idea. It&#x27;s a description with a list of claims about how the idea is acheived, which can cite prior art, but the requirement is that a &quot;non-obvious&quot; invention occurs in the claims, which can unfortunately include &quot;combination&quot; of two or more existing ideas.<p>Given that the author had only described brief ideas, they might serve as prior art, but as they don&#x27;t really establish claims on what is invented, someone could later come along and take the idea and develop it, coming up with &quot;inventions&quot; in their implementation. Such inventions are probably obvious to someone who takes the time to develop an idea, and would be rediscovered by anyone who starts from the same piece of prior art. A problem is that patent applications always start by using the broadest sense of the &quot;invention&quot; that it covers, and the claims are narrowed down if the application is rejected by the patent office, but applications can be revised and resubmitted many times.<p>The obviousness of ideas really depends on how much consideration is given to each one, so perhaps it would be in the interest of authors to establish claims on how each of their ideas might be achieved, as patents do (although they shouldn&#x27;t need to be written in legalese.) Maybe a separate hyperlinked article where more detail is given on each, particularly the ones he cares most about, would surely improve the protection against the ideas being taken.<p>One of my concerns is the invention of new terms in patent applications which cover already existing ideas. I&#x27;ve seen patents which cover something very obvious, but choose some unknown term to describe it like it&#x27;s something new.<p>The other major issue with these ideas is whether they are discoverable by a patent examiner, and proving that they were published prior to a patent application.<p>I had a discussion with a patent examiner a few years ago, and he pretty much expressed that existing patents, journals and scientific publications are preferred as prior art, because they are easier to verify. Other non-patent literature is googled, and archive.org is sometimes used to confirm publication date, but is unreliable.<p>However, I&#x27;ve just been reading the manual on patent examination[1] and it turns out that the scope of online publications is quite broad, and that providing a date on the publication is sufficient for an examiner to consider it prior art. They also need to archive a search strategy for each application.<p>I guess what we can take from that, is to ensure that we always include a publication date, and make an effort to reasonably disseminate the ideas so that they can be easily found by examiners and used as evidence that it was accessible to any patent applicant. Guess that means I should drop a self-hosted wiki and publish on github like the author too.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2128.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2128.html</a>",1374461132

Commercial OSS vendors reinforce this belief when they use price as a selling point. Consider this tweet by Alfresco Software (which is an OSS Content Management vendor: The City of Denver saved $1.5M by migrating from Documentum to Alfresco&quot;<p>OSS vendors need to sell &quot;freedom&quot; as well as price if that&#x27;s how they want to be perceived.They are the ones sowing the seeds.<p>Also, if you read this article more closely,and to the end, you&#x27;d see that it cites a study by Coverity (a huge proponent of OSS) that found that larger OSS projects aren&#x27;t as of high quality, that they need commercial vendors behind them and so on...<p>It also mentions that Drupal has 650 distros, 20,000 modules etc...that should speak to the argument for &quot;freedom&quot;.<p>Read on, and it says that commercial vendors who want to offer Big Data solutions can&#x27;t make it without adding a flavor of Hadoop or NoSQL into their mix. Doesn&#x27;t that speak well of OSS?<p>Further on it quotes Kevin Cochrane, OpenText&#x27;s VP of Marketing (who made his career at two commercial OSS companies); he  makes an argument for how enterprise-grade proprietary software can offer some of the same benefits as OSS &quot;We can give a safe, secure, and compliant platform to our community so that they can focus their initiative on what&#x27;s most meaningful to them: unleashing the power of information to transform line of business functions to gain faster time to innovation, faster time to market, faster time to revenue, faster time to customer success.”<p>Want to know what OSS developers can do better? Cochrane&#x27;s comment offers an answer: &quot;provide a safe, secure, and compliant platform&quot;. That is, by the way, exactly what many OSS commercial vendors are trying to build.<p>Later the article talks about how OSS appears to be risky to Enterprises whose businesses aren&#x27;t technology and/or whose engineers aren&#x27;t project commiters. Consider that if Netflix has a problem with Cassandra, and that for some reason Datastax disappears, they&#x27;ll be OK because they have engineers on the Apache project.But if Consumer Products Company XYZ has a problem and no one knows Cassandra well, they&#x27;d likely think that they&#x27;re up a creek without a paddle.For them, OSS may be to big a risk. Oracle, as much as it may cost and stink, may be a better bet..until Oracle&#x27;s offering can&#x27;t solve their problem.<p>That being said, all of the points you two make and the questions you ask are worth discussing. Maybe an article on the subject is in order. Until one is written, and if you are truly interested, look at the different strategies that MapR, Hortonworks, Cloudera and Pivotal are taking around Hadoop. Some say that at least two of them are no longer OSS. Let that can be your case study.You might see how freedom evolves to something that is no longer free, in every sense of the word.<p>Finally,and this could be the subject of still another article, what do you say about a project that has 15 committers. Is a CIO not to take into account what the future might look like if the commiters get into a fight, move on to new projects. or lose interest? The perception is that the Enterprise might end up with an abandoned  technology and without support.<p>To be frank,on an ideological level, I lean toward OSS but, in practical terms at the Enterprise level, there are still many questions that OSS vendors will need to have answers for.<p>Finally, the article concludes by saying that Enterprises shouldn&#x27;t be asking &quot;Proprietary or OSS&quot; but which solves their problems best. There are many considerations and many arguments for each.",1374459581

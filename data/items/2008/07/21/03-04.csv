251936,story,,,1,2,unalone,"How exactly do I go about AJAXifying part of a site?",,"I'm sure that title smacks of amateur. Forgive me, I'm an amateur, but my question is hopefully easy enough to be answerable despite your contempt.<p>I have a good idea for a site and I'm putting the site together now. I started off using a CMS for the beta, because for me launching the concept site and seeing if it really works is more important than my hand-coding every aspect of the thing. Problem is, for my idea to work, it requires some handy-dandy AJAX submission forms. (The entire idea revolves around passing data to the server and getting a response without an interruption to the page.)<p>So, I have a system built-in that handles comments. It verifies the user, adds the comments to the right page. How do I take that system and make it run using AJAX? Every tutorial I've seen makes it look difficult and confusing (I'm a terrible coder, which doesn't help). I've seen it done a lot, though, which makes me think that it's actually pretty easy and the tutorials are just poorly-written. Can anybody here explain how to go from slow commenting to smooth commenting? I'll be, er, really happy if you can.",1216612767

It'll be interesting to see if we ever tend back towards moderated places or if we continue to leapfrog from community to community in the frantic hope that we'll eventually find one that isn't overridden by the masses.<p>Hmmm.  How could I make this into a startup?",1216612555

In fact I’d argue that the field of mathematics in general disagrees with you.\nTime and time we find that mathematics can determine things that we never dreamed it could.  Things like “game theory” prove that the deeper we delve into statistical analysis the more we are able to determine what someone will and won’t do.  I’m not saying its ever going to be 100% accurate but if we can determine that x guy and y girl live happily ever after 85% of the time if they share z traits that still gives us the ability to match people far more successfully than we do now.",1216610469

251911,comment,251320,251345,0,0,LukeG,,,"Thanks for the feedback! (All of it)<p>A couple things that I hope will help:<p>- To search a location, use the modifier ""in"". So, the search [in London] will parse jobs that have London in their location field (we have a pretty good amount of structured data).<p>- Right now, the map only shows company ""headquarters."" Many startups have multiple offices; to post a job in a different location, they first create a new branch in their profile (structure), and then assign that location when they create the posting. So, the startup directory is lacking right now.<p>- We're definitely planning on getting into GeoIP stuff. As the saying goes: release early, release often.<p>Thanks again!",1216610448
251910,comment,251768,251861,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Well first, thanks for posting this.  Always nice to know someone enjoyed a post.  On what you said...<p>The big problem with the matching humans from what I can gather talking to people who try pure software solutions, is the lack of ground-truth. What appears on a site just doesn't match real life. Nothing beats the opportunity to evaluate a human in real-life. Any augmentation to help filter this process may have pay-off in a lot of other areas.<p>I think you’re right that people lie but I think statistics can, to a certain extent, help with that.  To give an example, let’s take a guy who loves Gilbert and Sullivan musicals but is ashamed of it so he says he hates theater productions.  But then in response to other questions he reveals more truthful answers.<p>Eventually, a statistical measurement will determine that Women who love musicals match best with guys who claim not to as long as they fit those other traits.  So the computer never manages to decode the lie but it still, through the magic of statistics, manages to make the match just the same.<p>I’m sure we’re years and years away from actually getting to the point of having an effective system like this but just the fact that we seem to have the power to do it is pretty amazing.",1216610447

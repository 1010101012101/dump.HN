230973,comment,230734,230734,0,0,cawel,,,"<i>""If all that stuff worked right out of the box, we'd all be out of a job,"" said David Strom</i><p>I'm not sure if this argument is used to support monopolies (via fueling the IT industry), but if it is, it's ludicrous. It's like saying that companies insuring against vandalism should thank the vandals.<p>I do not see ""fixing MS bugs""-companies as organic to the IT industry. Sure, more people are employed, but it does not create innovation, it does not contribute to the growth of the essence of the IT industry (different from the GDP resulting from the IT industry).<p><i>All of these problems are traceable to a lack of widely supported standards.</i><p>Pointing to a lack of standards to explain some of today's annoyances (MP3 compatibility, sync issues, etc.) is correct. However, linking the lack of standards with a lack of monopoly in those areas is wrong. I see soft anti-trust policies (in the case of DRM) or lack of motivation for creating standards-making bodies as more interesting causes. Diversity is not incompatible with the existence of common standards. Let's think of all web apps out there, offering competing products, all using HTTP.",1214715507

Downside, you have to actually manage your server.<p>I've used DreamHost, but their crap up-time and extra crap support drove me out.  I still use them for domain registration, but that's about the same anywhere, and transferring registrars is a little bit of a pain.  If you just want an easy plug-and-play test server or a personal blog, they're cheap and not completely terrible.",1214714234

We strive to hire people who love games, and we make games that we want to play. Every member of the team has input into all aspects of the game. Discussions around the halls and at lunch become the big ideas that shape the game. A programmer suggested to a designer the concept of gem-socketed, upgradeable weapons, which turned out to be a huge crowd-pleaser. A musician's dislike for the old frog-demon's animation inspired us to redo it. As a team, we don't have to wonder what our audience wants, because we are our audience. If we like the game we are making - especially if, after two years of playing it, we are not bored to death - the game is clearly going to be a winner.""<p><a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3124/postmortem_blizzards_diablo_ii.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3124/postmortem_blizza...</a>",1214713076

230954,comment,230639,230942,0,0,PieSquared,,,"I've been using Vim for about a year and a half now and actively trying to learn it well, and I think I am somewhere near knowing most of what it can do. Not all, of course, but definitely most. However, I've been thinking about trying Emacs as well, because unlike Vim (it seems) it has a [more] complete scripting language and a few other neat things. On the other hand, it's hard to give up a year's worth of experience of learning one editor, just to stop using it and go to another one.<p>Does anyone have significant experience in both, enough to know the peculiarities and such of each editor? I'd love to hear what you have to say on how they compare. Is learning Emacs worth it any more than learning everything Vim has to offer? Since I plan on using this for many years, I'd like to choose the optimal tool, even if it means wasting a year of experience.",1214712365

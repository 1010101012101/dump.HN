That's actually a ton of money.<p>Here's a couple of ways to stretch $1k marketing budget:<p>*  Hire an Indian/East European company on eLance that specializes in internet marketing.  Pay them $3-5 an hour x 10 hours a week x 3 months to do their thing.  Or, you can pay them by the task.<p>*   Write a letter to English/Business departments at the three closest colleges.  Tell them you have a 3 month marketing internship.  It's unpaid, but interns will receive a $200 a month stipend.  Have them write blog posts, blog comments, submit to bookmarking sites, write press releases, etc...  If college kids are your demographic, be sure to give your interns swag.<p>*   Get a bunch of users at once from Amazon's Mechanical Turk service.  Set up a job called, ""evaluate my new news service"", and pay $0.02 a hit.  10000 hits x $0.02 = $200  Ask them to write their impressions in a comments form on your HIT description.  Give them an option to submit their email address if they want to be updated about future changes to your site.<p>*  User Amazon's Mechanical Turk service command line tools to script a recurring HIT.  You can ask 100 people a day to look at your site, register, comment, etc...  100 hits a day x $0.02 = $2 a day.<p>*  Adwords, but depending on your site, your keywords, you're probably looking at $0.05-.50 a hit.<p>*  Depending on your site, you could hold a competition and submit it to whatever forums and BBS's you'd like to.  The winner gets a brand new $200 iPod.<p>*  Buy swag and hand it out to your targeted demographic.  Or, give it to your first passionate users.  People love free stuff, and you might be able to get some word of mouth/buzz from passionate users that just got a t-shirt from your site.  Cost of a custom T-shirts in small batches:  $10-15 a piece.

So consider SS as insurance in case of a long life.<p>Some people will live well over 100 so finding the ""correct"" amount of money to save is overkill for most people who die far younger than that.  If you invested a portion of your savings each year and pooled you money with 10,000 other people your age then paid dividends from that to the survivors you could save less money and still not worry about running out.  Granted if to many people lived until retirement age you might need to reduce benefits.  Granted you would not be able to give people money at the time of your death but if your single what's the point?<p>Now the implementation of social security is broken in several ways but minor changes in retirement age will fix the ""benefit gap"" long before it runs out of money.  The basic problem is people are living longer so they need to increase average retirement age.  The surplus was also invested in government bonds with terrible long term returns etc, but when you consider how much more important the first 20k/year is over the next you might consider guaranteed benefits even at high cost are worth a lot more than the simple math would suggest.<p>PS: There are a lot of things I hate about SS, but it's not really a Ponzi scheme.",1231166161

Which granted, would look good to a lot of people right now, but is bad financial planning on the whole.<p>On the other hand, I reject his cries of paternalism for the simple reason that other people's poverty has a negative effect on my life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Poor people have incredibly high rates of criminal activity, drug use, etc. Granted, I don't see a lot of retirees selling crack or robbing banks, but the effect it could have on their families, who sometimes they support or sometimes support them, could create a serious ripple down through generations.<p>Which doesn't necessarily mean I'm for Social Security or forced savings of any kind, but the issue is not nearly so simple as paternalism.",1231164597

They don't emphasize the expensive packages first, to make the cheaper packages seem more affordable. They make the one you want huge, and the 49 dollar price, at first glance, seems expensive. If they emphasized or drew your eye to the $149 package first, by the time you get to the package you want, at 1/3rd the cost you were looking at before, you'd be more inclined to feel it is a good deal.<p>Look at WuFoo's design, they do an incredibly great job at the price chart, and they can back up their decisions with data.<p><a href=""http://wufoo.com/signup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wufoo.com/signup/</a><p>On the other hand, if your service is not something you're trying to upsell people on based on gimmicky features, I strongly suggest following the Slicehost model: <a href=""http://www.slicehost.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slicehost.com/</a> They know you know what you need, so they very plainly list all of the plans and their prices with no gimmicky sales bullshit.

The problem is population shrinking.<p>The generation retiring is much larger than the ones still working when population has shrunk at some point.

Either way the government has to raise $4 trillion (plus interest) in taxes, borrow it, or print it to pay it off. Either way everyone is in the exact same boat, except in boat b, Americans get the interest. In boat a the Chinese do. (Unless you count borrowing from the Chinese, leaving the Social Security money in a CD, and defaulting to on the borrowed money while paying out SS an option, which it isn't.)<p>I wasn't suggesting that government borrowing is not a problem. It is. They probably should just not borrow the $4 trillion from anywhere.

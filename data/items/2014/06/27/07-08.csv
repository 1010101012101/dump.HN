7953111,comment,7950637,7950637,3,0,goblin89,,,"I try to look at this logically.<p>It&#x27;s known that in any communication you should have and remember an objective—what you want to achieve as the result.<p>Sometimes this objective is immediate, which is the easiest case. Other times it&#x27;s more strategic, with long-term benefits—this one can be harder to keep in mind. At minimum an objective can be as basic as “keeping good relationship with”.<p>This objective <i>almost never</i> involves pissing off another person. Having good relationships, apart from everything else, helps you practically. It&#x27;s irrational to aim to piss off or let down another person. When that happens it seems to be due to lost objective and uncontrolled thought process. (I&#x27;m talking about personal relationships—things could be different, say, in business situations.)<p>Keeping in mind your objective helps staying polite, positive and kind, but requires certain mental resources. This could be easy for some people, while from others more resources is required due to psychological issues (inner fears, lack of self-confidence).<p>An especially difficult case, I find, is when another person initiates a communication. Then I don&#x27;t have an immediate objective in mind ready. I need to spend some time recalling a long-term one. During that time I can be accidentally rude and unkind (I guess I have my issues…), even to people close to me. Sometimes I recall my objective only after the communication is complete, to my regret.<p>I guess one part of the solution involves training myself to defer any communication until I can recall my objective.",1403855819

7953108,comment,7929718,7931285,2,0,jrock08,,,"But you&#x27;re assuming a car first approach.  And on a high-way, I agree with you.  It&#x27;s a car&#x27;s world, but in a city, or town on a non-major thoroughfare, cars and bikes should be able to co-exist peacefully.  To stretch your analogy a bit, low speed roadways would be like swimming in non-shark infested waters.  Sure, you are liable to see car but you shouldn&#x27;t feel like you are in danger when your are passed by the car, and on the other side, drivers shouldn&#x27;t feel like they are within inches of killing a cyclist when they use a road legally and responsibly.  (I add responsibly there because many drivers will complain that they feel they have to pay more attention when the drive near cyclists.  I find this a wholly unconvincing argument, if you aren&#x27;t paying attention while driving you aren&#x27;t driving responsibly)<p>I also don&#x27;t have any desire to use a car frequently.  I shouldn&#x27;t be forced to resort to a car to travel anything less than 15 miles due to fear or lack of infrastructure.  And we face a chicken and egg problem.  It would be great if we could have elevated bikeways tomorrow, but the truth of the matter is we should be encouraging bike use now not hypothetically in a utopian future.  Because without proven use, there&#x27;s no way major bike infrastructure projects will happen.",1403855702

7953106,comment,7950102,7952976,3,0,qwerty_asdf,,,"I think the tilde operator and Underscore are both equally cryptic and represent similar degrees of obfuscation. Tilde doesn&#x27;t get much use, because it&#x27;s prone to quirky behavior, particularly with respect to negative one in javascript. Gven that javascript has junk lying around like NaN, undefined, null, ==, ===, I tend to mistrust anything that isn&#x27;t dog-ugly bland convention.<p>Aliases are also ugly in my opinion, given that they can be reassigned any old time. Even the much-used dollar sign alias demands extra scrutiny, when inspectng unfamiliar code. The advantage is that they&#x27;re (aliases, that is) are easy to write, not easy read. On the other hand, the &quot;contains&quot; function <i>should</i> adhere to the sanest contract most would expect from it, and if it does, &quot;contains&quot; is easy enough to understand. But yeah, depending on libraries is either laziness or bullshit, when it comes to core language functionality. The only thing advanced libraries really offer is cross-browser compatibility.<p>Meanwhile, (x.indexOf(y) == -1) is dead simple, as long as you know that arrays start at zero, never have negative indices, and that indexOf() returns a negative value when the argument isn&#x27;t matched by an object in the array. Returning a negative value, as parlance for &quot;not found&quot;, when an absolute integer value is expected, is a pretty sane convention.",1403855632

No menu bar (I use the run command for everything I do not launch from terminal), no plasma widgets (my tmuxes give me hour, which is all I need), no whatever desktop integration. I even don&#x27;t use compositing.<p>So, why am I using kde, would you ask ? Because I never found any desktop environment as much configurable. Kde is over-featured, but still never get in the way if you want to.<p>Each window has an incredible set of configuration to make it looks like what you want. Those settings can either be temporary or be persisted, using regexp on various attributes allowing to target specific applications, or even specific popup created by specific application.<p>The list of keyboard shortcuts you can define is massive. And every application allows to redefine its shortcuts individually. I&#x27;ve actually never found any action I wanted to redefine and it was not allowed (and keyboard is by far my main interface).

In the past, I&#x27;ve switched a lot between kde and wmii, which offered the same kind of configurability (through its plan9 virtual fs - not sure it&#x27;s still the case since wmii developers are obsessed with removing features) just because of that.

7953088,comment,7952764,7952764,3,0,wombosi,,,"I find it fascinating to see the division of this topic being along seemingly national lines, i.e. European commenters seem in favor, while American commenters seem vehemently against the EU court ruling. This is somewhat of a generalization, but it does highlight an interesting phenomenon. It appears the overwhelming (?) majority of young American internet users, who have come of age in the post 9/11 USA are disturbingly willing to relinquish as many freedoms and rights, as is demanded of them. In fact, they take it one step further, in a form of self-perpetuating pseudo-cultural hegemony, they try to impose this &quot;If you&#x27;re innocent you have nothing to hide!&quot; mentality on Americans and non-Americans alike.<p>The fact that global search engines often can have extremely negative implications vis-a-vis personal data retention, is one that more easily escapes those who were born naturally into the Internet age, as opposed to those who &quot;merely adopted it&quot;. The &quot;adopters&quot; are usually more sensitive to the before-and-after effects, than the &quot;naturals&quot;, usually because the naturals often lack the firsthand context with which to make informed comparisons of said effects.<p>A contributing, and perhaps aggravating, factor is the tendency of many (possibly younger) HNers to fall into knee-jerk behavioral patterns of vociferously defending all that is Google, from the somewhat irrational perspective of Google being All That Is Good And Holy, simply because of the corporation&#x27;s trite slogan of &quot;Do No Evil&quot;. At the very latest, the Snowden revelations and ensuing NSA scandals have shown us Google and co. are as far from sainthood as any other multibillion dollar multinational corporation.<p>In summary, the European little guy has scored an important victory that gives them the tools to improve their quality of life, or at the very least avoid a degradation thereof. How this is twisted into censorship of a search giant is fascinating and very revealing of other deeper and far more worrisome underlying tendencies within the very defenders of the &quot;Mega Corp&quot;.",1403854979

Found a file /usr/share/doc/sysv-rc/README.policy-rc.d.gz on my system where it says:<p>> POLICY-RC.D Policy layer (/usr/sbin/policy-rc.d) interface:<p>> Most Debian systems will not have this script as the need for a policy layer is not very common. Most people using chroot jails just need an one-line script which returns an exit status of 101 as the jailed /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d script.<p>I think, however, that the point that the parent comment was trying to make was that it&#x27;d be convenient if this was a switch to apt-get. After all, if you are just looking to install one additional daemon on a running system, it&#x27;d be a whole lot easier if you could:<p># apt-get install --no-start-daemon example<p>than to have to activate a policy script which you might forget to remove or deactivate.<p>However, in the file I mentioned above, the next line says:<p>> The /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d file <i>must</i> be managed through the alternatives system (/usr/sbin/update-alternatives) by any packages providing it.<p>So maybe one solution is to create your own script to manage it.<p>In fact, your script could even be a wrapper for apt-get. To be totally transparent in day-to-day use, you could then make apt-get be an alias for your wrapper script.<p>Your wrapper then:<p>1. Activates the policy.<p>2. Calls the real apt-get.<p>3.

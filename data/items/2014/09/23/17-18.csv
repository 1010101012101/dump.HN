We both feel we &quot;right-engineer&quot;, so to them I&#x27;m over-engineering and to me they&#x27;re under engineering.  I think we could co-exist.  I build the frameworks and design clean interfaces for them, that way their feature stack is shorter and quicker to get out.<p>They don&#x27;t always feel the same.  They want me to engineer less, and I just can&#x27;t do it.  It feels like I&#x27;m doing a huge disservice to the product, to future me (developing more features), and to them.",1411495194

I kept thinking about that &quot;positive&quot; mentality, for a long time. It can start to make sense at one point or another. If you&#x27;re depressed, I think it&#x27;s important to have a minimum of knowledge about questions on the meaning of life or something like that. If it can make you think in a healthy way and prevent people to turn into stupid things, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really insignificant.<p>Good life philosophy can help you make better choices. I&#x27;m not talking about religion, I&#x27;m just talking in general, how do you look at the world.<p>I agree that philosophy won&#x27;t really help, but it would be stupid to just not talk about it a little.",1411495187

Why do you cook? Is it to save cash or is it recreation? Or something else?<p>I love it.  Also, we do have a frugal lifestyle, so I would probably force myself if I didn&#x27;t.  I have been doing this since my wife and I moved in together -- so about 15 years.<p>2. Do you plan ahead? Like a weekly meal plan?<p>I used to -- with so much experience, I can wing it.  I make sure to have a lot of choices, a stocked pantry, and I just make stuff up usually.  If I find a recipe I want to try, I plan better that week.  For baking, I have to plan a little more.<p>3. What kind of things do you cook usually?<p>Normal stuff -- basically &quot;Healthy American&quot; -- so two vegetable sides and a little meat, light on starches.  I have a lot of Latino and Italian dishes in my repertoire (from my Grandmothers).  I will try anything though -- cook out of a classic Indian cookbook sometimes.  I use &quot;How to Cook Everything&quot; as a mash-up source -- see how something is basically made (ratios, technique) and take it from there.<p>Breakfasts are diner-fare usually (omelets, eggs any way, fruited pancakes, etc.).<p>4. Do you follow any diet? Atkins, Slow Carb etc.<p>I used to follow Paleo and it influenced my style.  I do a lot of slow cooking from that time -- also jerky.<p>5. Do you have any life hacks, tips to be more productive as a cook?<p>Cook in bulk. Get a slow cooker.  Realize that you will get better at it if you do it a lot.

I would say that it might be hard to simultaneously convince yourself that a project needs the maximum possible performance and also that it is tractable for you as a newbie C developer.<p>A simple kernel module might not be a bad thing, if you can do your development in a VM to recover from the inevitable crashes.

The operational costs of replacing a drive have three parts, loss of production while the drive is offline, operator time to physically replace the drive and prep it for re-entry into the system, and transactional costs of doing a warranty replacement (filling out the RMA form, getting a valid RMA, shipping the and receiving replacements). We minimize the latter by doing RMAs in batches of 20 but its still a cost across those 20 drives. (and the population of 40 drives which exist as spares are effectively not available for production).

Now that I need to provide a good healthy meal every night and it&#x27;s harder to eat out, I had enough incentive to get over the hump of novice cook. Once I got a bit more skill, it got easier and a lot more enjoyable.<p>I find the physical, analog, informal nature of cooking helps balance my otherwise too-logical, too-digital life. I love working on my technique. Chopping vegetables is my Zen activity.<p>2. My wife and I try to do a weekly meal plan so we can do most of the shopping on the weekend. In practice, we often forget. Fortunately, we live really close to a few grocery stores, so quick frequent trips aren&#x27;t too bad.<p>During the week, we tend to do easy stuff (breakfast for dinner, grilled cheese, burgers, burritos, etc.) since time is limited between I getting home from work and the kids going to bed. We do bigger cooking or try new recipes on the weekend and often have friends and family over.<p>3. This summer I&#x27;ve done a lot of grilling. I&#x27;m still learning, so I tend to iterate on a small number of areas instead of trying lots of everything. Grilled whole chicken, breakfast, burgers, salmon, and steak are our go-tos. I make a decent bibimbap but it&#x27;s a lot of prep work. We aren&#x27;t very adventurous because we have young kids, but they do enjoy eggs en cocotte and some other random stuff. I make the best croque madame I&#x27;ve ever had.<p>4. No. My wife and I did a Whole 30 a while back, but usually we just try to eat something from all of the food groups. The Whole 30 was generally awful, but it did get me to realize that carbs have a net negative on my diet, so I try to reduce those now -- less baked goods and desserts mainly.<p>5. <i>Take notes.</i> I learn a lot every time I try a recipe, but I don&#x27;t make the same thing ten nights in a row. If I don&#x27;t write down what I learned, I won&#x27;t remember when I make it again two months later. So, now, I keep notes for each recipe I do. I have the recipe (with my latest revisions) and then a series of &quot;lab notes&quot; describing what I did each time, how it came out, and what adjustments I should make.<p>This has been hugely helpful. I have a handful of things now that I feel are &quot;mine&quot; and are much better than the original recipe I found. Seriously, my grilled &quot;thirded&quot; chicken is off the hook.<p>Some other basic but really good advice:<p>- Mise en place! Clean and organize before you start putting stuff on the fire!<p>- Put a wet paper towel under your cutting board.<p>- Keep your knife sharp and work on your technique.<p>- There are youtube videos for everything.

One of the ways to learn C++ is make a relatively complex data structure (red-black tree, or bloom filter) and then throw as much data as you can inside it, see when you cross a threshold of memory usage -- then see if you can improve on that.<p>Having said that, C++ has come a long way, despite what haters say.

Just like the fees charged by hedge funds which are taxed as ordinary income.&quot;<p>Taxable methodology isn&#x27;t generally determined by the way you earn your income. The concept of long term capital gains was created to reward investors (those who invest their own capital) who hold capital in a given investment vehicle for over a year, not for whether or not they are taking on risk, or whether they are paid out based on a fixed fee or fixed percentage of profit. We don&#x27;t tax waiters at a different rate for the money they get on tips (sweat equity) vs. their base salary.<p>Fees charged by private equity are also fixed - they are a fixed percentage of profit. So again, I don&#x27;t see why this is any different. We have an investment vehicle taking in money, making investment decisions on the behalf of their investors and then making a percentage of the profits - all normal activities - nothing that warrants special tax treatment.<p>Comparing selling your company to carried interest isn&#x27;t appropriate - apples and oranges - but to your entrepreneurs example: if they accept investment in their company, then their company has shares. Gains on those shares are treated exactly the same as any other share in any company - short term gains on stock held less than a year or long term if you&#x27;ve held it a year or longer.  This is why many people exercise their options in a startup as a way to start that clock as soon as possible to avoid short-term tax consequences.<p>Again - PE firms are offering a service and will receive a good profit for their hard work. But that work often involves minimal capital on their part and therefore should not be treated as if it is their capital at risk.",1411493298

8356457,comment,8354278,8354278,8,0,lpage,,,"The race to zero (or more accurately c) on the networking front is seeing significant action, largely because it&#x27;s the &quot;lowest hanging fruit.&quot; Network latency is six to eight orders of magnitude higher than processing latency in most case. By Amdahl&#x27;s Law, it&#x27;s a very good system to optimize. This is especially true for places like Korea, and for the US where there&#x27;s significant geographic distance between futures and equities.<p>Microwave is an &quot;early adopter&quot; technology that will soon be replaced with superior ones. The first microwave network was slated to cost 15M/yr at the time of its launch in 2012. However, competition dropped that number to around 2M by launch time, and within six months it was < 250K. Mind you, everyone was locked into a 1-2yr contract at the higher price points. For the U.S. Tradeworx (aka Thesys) is one of the fastest &quot;publicly&quot; available networks so they&#x27;re commanding a premium at $250K, but microwave is now available for less than 80K a mere two years after launch. Same story for Spread  - seven figures and a two year commitment at the time of launch, down to 15-60K.<p>On days with snow, rain, or wind kicking up pollen/dust, packets are dropped at comical rates. Dropping a packet is more expensive latency wise than sending it over Spread, and if the weather is bad enough, you&#x27;re not getting anything through at all, which leads to dual Spread/microwave deployments. Spread knows this which is why the introduction of microwave didn&#x27;t dramatically drop the price of Spread.<p>Bandwidth wise you used to get about 1.5Mbps over a shared link. That number is better now, but not substantially. Even with no loss there&#x27;s barely enough bandwidth to carry L1 price updates on a single active market data symbol, so market data on the whole is a no go. From what I can tell most people have gone the route of transmitting many types of data over both fiber and microwave while leaving the responsibility of deduping to the receiver.<p>There&#x27;s not much coverage on it but we&#x27;ll see some interesting things on the fiber front soon. Photonic-crystal fiber is getting cheaper and we&#x27;ll continue to see interesting advances on the hollow-core photonic-bandgap front in general [1]. These technologies can theoretically get very close to the speed of light (.997c) with extremely high bandwidth and low attenuation (repeaters in either fiber or microwave networks add significant latency) at which point the race to zero will stair step down again.<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v7/n4/full/nphoton.2013.45.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v7/n4/full/nphoton.201...</a>",1411492151

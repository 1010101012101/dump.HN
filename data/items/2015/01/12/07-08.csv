Why not just keep the repository local?<p>My two cents on this are that I always try to outsource any internal services to reduce maintenance time. For example<p>1. Own git repository will need backup and server configuration to be accessed from all machines that I own, which means I will need to spend time on security.<p>2. Own GitLab instance will mean 1 + system resources ( GitLab actually uses more than I would like to spare )<p>3. If I need to benefit hooks and pretty UI I would also need to do 1 + 2 + writing README files and integrate with different CI services.<p>What I figured out is that there are 1 and 2 outsourced and free ( bitbucket ), so I would not bother doing this on my own.",1421049289

Rust documentation states that send() will never block and channels have infinite buffer.<p>AFAIK, rust also doesn&#x27;t allow selecting between a send and receive on channels. It only allows selecting over a set of receivers and even there it doesn&#x27;t offer something like the default clause of Go&#x27;s select statement.<p>Rust does have interesting features to prevent data races but it&#x27;s concurrency model is very different from CSP and Go.

I generally see those things as a waste of time and money to get unless you want to work in a very large and very traditional (finance, insurance, etc) company.<p>Engineering background should give you a good foundation for analytical thought and building testing systems. I&#x27;d leverage that as well as you can in interviews. Past that, read up a lot on modern approaches to testing and have a working knowledge of the terminology and approach for a few frameworks for ruby/python/java/c# to cover a fair amount of currently popular development languages.<p>Learn a scripting language really really well, whether python or ruby.<p>Best of luck.",1421046778

Lately I find myself more and more convinced that if I had learned Programming in a more formal context I would have seen results faster than not. While I agree that seeing results is important to the learning loop I think that correctly learning is the way to do that. Programming produces code, solutions to problems produce results.<p>So if you want to see results you will have to first find a problem and solve it without thinking on how to program it. Sure &#x27;outputting text&#x27; is a valid problem, however not very useful. &quot;Reading a text file&quot; might be a bit more on par and will immediately give you several tutorials on how to achieve that. And the way to go is to solve problems and not to &#x27;program&#x27; you will just find yourself in a corner, unsure on what to do next.\nOne could e.g. search on how to pass over a parameter to a program, how c++ handles file inputs, I/O Streams.",1421046619

There is a large focus on secrecy seemingly within the organization itself (Palantir) and the organizations it works with (NSA, CIA, FBI, etc.). One important question is, why is Palantir arming secretive organizations with very powerful technology?<p>If the analysis capabilities are so great (and they appear to at least be good), then there is likely tremendously more good that can be achieved by opening up the code to the software so that anyone can use it to tackle local and global problems around the planet.

8878883,comment,8873914,8878740,0,0,tragic,,,"Yeah: I listen to a lot of very obscure 90s emo records, which were all fly-by-night bands on tiny vinyl-only labels (and other similar corners of the music industry). This stuff is not on Spotify. I did not expect it to be on Spotify, and thus was not disappointed.<p>For contemporary stuff of that level of nicheness, Bandcamp is a much better source. And selling one $5 download/print-on-demand CD is probably more lucrative than all the Spotify streams most bandcamp bands could ever hope to get put together, so it&#x27;s hardly surprising that they go this way. Spotify seems a more sensible partnership for labels with significant back catalogue than individual artists. (Which makes it peculiar that I can&#x27;t browse by label, but there you go.)<p>I like Spotify for classical music and jazz, but my tastes are more &#x27;mainstream&#x27; in those categories.

There are some reputable and useful sites that use ad income, I don&#x27;t routinely use AdBlock or similar for that reason. If a site annoys me with its ads it gets DNS blacklisted (pointed towards my &quot;you don&#x27;t want to go there&quot; page via local DNS config.<p><i>> neither the ads nor the ad-serving pages are a good deal for anyone in any way.</i><p>Hence the DNS blacklist, though this isn&#x27;t overly helpful (mainly because new sites spring up constantly) and not useful to non-techies (most people don&#x27;t run a local DNS cache that they can drop a new block into with a simple script call).<p>I am considering a browser extension that takes it from this point of view rather than the AdBlock point of view though, i.e. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go to such sites&quot; rather than &quot;I&#x27;ll go to such sites, but they aren&#x27;t serving me ads and other crap&quot;.

Something that either intercepts page transitions and warns &quot;you&#x27;ve previously marked this site as having irritating pop-ups, are you sure you want to proceed?&quot; and/or scans pages for links and visually marks those pointing towards marked domains. The next step would then be some sort of distributed store for collating what people mark so it can warn about sites I&#x27;ve not previously visited, though of course if such a thing became popular enough to be useful there would be the constant game of trying to stop people abusing this to block competitors sites or de-list their own.<p><i>> As for the Downloads.com, CNET, et al. ... they deserve to be down.</i><p>I can&#x27;t say I disagree there!",1421142909

It needs to be for security reasons, as a program must never receive memory with data left from a different process.<p>Memory often is coming from previously-freed heap space within the process.  There is no security need to zero such memory.  Zeroing it wouldn&#x27;t even help, because the process is free to read the memory before malloc returns it.<p>And calloc, no matter how optimized it is, will still be more expensive than malloc which doesn&#x27;t have to zero the memory.<p>> Modern CPUs are so superscalar internally that an overflow check (which doesn&#x27;t get flagged most of the time anyway) doesn&#x27;t add anything to the execution speed.<p>&quot;Doesn&#x27;t add anything&quot; is not correct.

Real stylish.<p>I think many people would want something like an iPhone 6S with the option of having a bigger battery and built-in case at the expense of a few mm of thickness. Basically, make the back removable (even if just when ordering or at Apple stores) and make a more rugged version which also contains a second battery. The fronts and guts can all be exactly the same for manufacturing efficiency, then the wrap-around back can be swapped out to change color / if it gets smashed or bent / if the user wants to replace the battery etc. I really think this could work while retaining their fit and finish + manufacturing efficiency, and it&#x27;s surely make consumers happy.

You&#x27;re comparing these problem with city like Tokyo and Taipei, and this makes me think that the main problem probably comes from the age of the infrastructure.<p>The métro in Paris dates back to 1900, and in London it goes back to 1863.

At least to the extent implied in the article.<p>For example &quot;use of an unitialized variable&quot;. Given that the compiler already has to analyze the program flow to determine if the variable could be use unitialized to output that warning, the optimization step to not initialize those variables that are written to before used doesn&#x27;t seem so far away. This happens at compile time.<p>But, there&#x27;s also the fact that a modern OS gives you heap memory zeroed mostly for free. A call to calloc is highly optimized nowadays. It needs to be for security reasons, as a program must never receive memory with data left from a different process.<p>Likewise the signed integer overflow check. Modern CPUs are so superscalar internally that an overflow check (which doesn&#x27;t get flagged most of the time anyway) doesn&#x27;t add anything to the execution speed.<p>And finally we are able to use that without resorting to assembler. GCC 5 has added support for built-in functions for arithmetics with overflow checking.",1421141397

And I suspect he&#x27;s used to developing in Windows, likely with visual studio, and in comparison, Linux can feel quite archaic. And in that context, maintaining Linux build systems can seem quite painful, likely the primary reason it&#x27;s getting dropped.<p>On the contrary, with Valve&#x27;s current and monumental efforts, I suspect we&#x27;re going to see a lot of games continuing to be released on Linux.

8878753,comment,8877502,8878156,0,0,mercurial,,,"> Go lacks a construct comparable to &quot;with&quot; in Python, or WITH-OPEN-FILE in Lisp, to guarantee that things get closed out on scope exit. Go has &quot;defer&quot;, but that&#x27;s a clunky replacement. You have to explicitly write the &quot;defer&quot;, and it&#x27;s always function-scope, not construct-scope.<p>The problem of avoiding resource leaks is somewhat orthogonal to error handling, though. Do note that Python&#x27;s &quot;with&quot; statement doesn&#x27;t play well with &quot;yield&quot;, which is an important gotcha. But in practice, it&#x27;s quite convenient.",1421139663

There seem to be repeated suggestions that YC alumni will nibble away or topple the Fortune 500's, uh, fortunes. With a lot of these startups creating new markets of their own I'm not sure I necessarily agree with that zero-sumesque view, but I wouldn't be surprised if they cause some interesting disruptions.",1240973157

I'm not disagreeing, just curious.  YC has funded a lot of startups and it would be interesting to know roughly what percentage have failed, become profitable, exited, etc.  How does this compare to other venture portfolios?  If it's still too early to tell, at what point will you have enough data to know if you're earning an acceptable return?<p>Perhaps this data is already available somewhere?<p>PS - One of the things about the article that bugged me is that they seemed to equate $$ raised with success.

The average introvert is kind of an anti-nerd -- the same elements are there, but the causation is inverted.  An introvert's self-imposed isolation comes off as snobbery, which creates a social challenge for them.  Nerds are socially challenged, which leads to social isolation, which they try to frame as high standards (i.e., justified snobbery.)<p>The Introvert:  introversion => social isolation => perceived snobbery => social challenges<p>The Nerd:  socially challenged => social isolation => pretense of snobbery or introversion",1240971252

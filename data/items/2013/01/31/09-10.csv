It's worth noting that many in China do not share your view, and we have the weibo messages to prove it.

Nation building by rebel proxy does not work as intended. You only have to look at your so called new ""US-controlled democracies"" to dispel any idea of US control.<p>Meanwhile, the new york times reported on corruption in those around Wen Jiabao, and the Chinese government hacked into their systems apparently so they could find out who provided information to the reporters and how they got the information that they did.

Its like the public will accept an ""illness"" as real, but a psychological issues as not real. There for making the public see depression as ""illness"" helps get support. See what I mean?<p>From what I can make out, depression is a state of mind. Its a psychological thing. Ie, its a sort of loop people get themselves in to. That, to me, is not an illness. Not more so than arrogance, confidence or anger. Its an emotion. Is love an illness too? I realise that can be debated, but I don't think its helpful to redefine things for PR reasons. To me that cheapens it.<p>I'm not saying depression is there for less valid, clearly its as debilitating as what I would think of as real ""illness"", if not more so, but I do roll my eyes and switch off every time I hear the word ""illness"" appropriated for things that aren't really ""illnesses"". As I say, the lack of the word illness doesn't, to me, make it less serious. To me, using that word is not necessary, it just blurs the lines and can put people off caring. It make it sound exaggerated or a bit ""me too"".<p>Should add that I do understand that there are different types of depression. Perhaps using the single word depression to cover all cases is more the problem that the word ""illness"".<p>I'm by no means unsympathetic, I know how it can effect people. I've seen the results of suicide. Hell, my mum's other half had to cut the bloke down while the wife screamed in the street.

That light was snuffed out, but John (and Yoko, and many, many others) were really trying hard to get a world peace movement established, that would bring more love to the world.<p>If you turn on the TV today, you don't see much love.

In fact, remove the laugh-track from most TV shows and you have a banal hate festival.<p>I think depression being treated poorly, in general, by society is symptomatic of a larger maladay - which is that we humans simply don't trust our neighbors.  We don't communicate freely and honestly with each other.  You can't smile at a stranger in Vienna, for instance, just for the sake of the happiness - there <i>always</i> has to be the inference of an alternative, sinister, motive.  Why is that?<p>Its because, fundamentally our cultural veigns - the mass communications networks of PR, Advertising, News, TV - don't profit from happiness and good times.  They profit from the ""black blood cell"" of intrigue, controversy, synthesis/anti-synthesis.  All we really see on TV is conflict this and that, and if there is some sort of consolation, its usually couched as ""irony"" or some such emotion.<p>But what of true Peace, where people are getting along great?  There is a lot of that in the world, and it goes under-reported, and just not noticed by the majority.  Its possible that depression is a social disease, and is contagious.<p>But, so is happiness.<p>We need more overt acknolwedgement of the good times, too, in my opinion - the truly good times, real progress.

The only reason they are still around in the first place, is sheer size. Smaller retailers would never survive on the profit margins Amazon is producing.<p>The thing that sticks out most from their earnings release is that the trend is clearly downward. The profit margins and net cash flow are sinking, while operating costs, number of employees, etc are rising. Added to that, their market cap/stock valuation is truly insane, which IMO is a ticking time bomb.<p>What this all means is that Amazon is going to get in a shitload of trouble somewhere down the road.

All it takes is some relatively minor event (more focused competition, lower consumer spending, some kind of bad media attention) and their stock will tank, and the whole constellation could go down like a house of cards.<p>No matter how much you like Amazon and its services, it's hardly an example of a solid business if you ask me.",1359623982

I'm currently developing an Saas product myself, so I'm actually torn between choosing various currency processors/vendors.<p>Can someone explain as to<p>1) Why and when one should use BitCoin?<p>2) What advantages does BitCoin have over traditional payment processors like PayPal/Stripe?<p>3) Is there any legal downside of using BitCoin? (For example, I read somewhere that Bitcoins are used for Money Laundering and the governments are actively monitoring anyone using BitCoins)<p>4) How much do you save (if at all) by going with BitCoin instead of someone popular like PayPal/Stripe?<p>Thanks!",1359622885

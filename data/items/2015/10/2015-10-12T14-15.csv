10374902,comment,10370132,10372359,0,0,geebee,,,"This is a really good post.  I identify with a lot in it.<p>I double majored in english literature and math, and I added the math late.  I was very interested in CS and math (it wasn&#x27;t a thing yet in the mid 90s but now they call my interests &quot;data science&quot;).  Of course, aspirations about what life will be like when you &quot;grow up&quot; are always a bit of a naive fantasy, but I thought (or at least hoped) that I would be able to join a more urbane, sophisticated, <i>adult</i> world at some point.  That may sound a bit naive, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with aspiring to it. When I joined the tech working world, I was disappointed that my office manager seems to think that a foosball table and video game machine turn fit into some kind of nirvana, or that my office went to dave n busters for a retreat… it&#x27;s not that I can&#x27;t enjoy it, I can, but I heard about the retreats friends in law firms were taking, and I was envious of how much more sophisticated, <i>adult and grown up</i> it all sounded).  I don&#x27;t mean to sound like I&#x27;m putting life in a law firm as all roses, I am absolutely aware that it isn&#x27;t, but I was envious that they seemed to have joined an adult world whereas tech seemed to be a relatively immature, almost extended adolescent culture.<p>Unfortunately, over time, I&#x27;ve slowly started to believe there may be something more insidious in the juvenility of tech culture, and that it may be imposed as much from the outside as the inside.  I&#x27;m not sure the people who hire programmers really want to view them as adults.  More like minions, talented but immature young men rotating through, happy with their video games and foosball tables and salaries that pay well enough to enjoy a delayed adolescence but never enough to put down roots and raise a family where they live and work… ultimately, I think this is damaging and may very well deter a lot of potentially talented people from entering the field, or cause others to leave.",1444661980

Only military aircraft have radar systems designed to pick up other traffic.<p>Some airliners have active traffic systems (most do not), but the real reason it&#x27;s safe is that all the airliner and jet traffic is cruising well above where the piston-engine aircraft are flying.

In the short term if there&#x27;s a lack of infrastructure you can grow shipping at a very fast rate, until you catch up...<p>In the long run the &quot;walking dead&quot; from the article are doomed when due to technological growth an entire data center can be converted to a single rack in a closet without any expensive monthly upstream bandwidth charges and nickel and dimeing from a cloud.  Those suppliers have expensive corporate infrastructure that depends on shipping $50M data centers in 2005 not a single $100K rack in 2015, or 2025 or 2035 or whatever, to do the same task.  Maybe a great sales campaign can convince them to double their usage, that still leaves them $49.8M in the hole, non-inflation adjusted (ouch).<p>Computational use for non-computer businesses is kinda like electricity in the VERY long term.

However, here we are, there is a natural leveling off of how much electricity or municipal water or food a business can usefully consume per unit of GDP.  Assuming GDP only goes up, inflation adjusted (LOL).  When companies bounce off those limits, life will get very exciting for &quot;eternal Moores Law growth forever&quot; oriented suppliers for those businesses.  Based on facebook use stat growth rates in 2007 we should all be spending 78626 hours per day on facebook... didn&#x27;t happen... building a supplier company based on that assumed growth trend will lead to tears.

Once they had achieved scale, they found themselves with too much momentum to innovate. So because they couldn&#x27;t innovate, they built an army of consultants to hawk their wares to customers who also valued scale. But that consulting business never really took off because its existence was predicated on a model of dumping obsolete (but &quot;enterprisey&quot;!) hardware/software onto customers already suffering from vendor lock-in. When those customers start to struggle (as they inevitably will, because the tech industry is far from the only one where scale can impede your ability to innovate) the market has moved on to a different place, and the company never kept up. Then you see a death spiral of layoffs and divestitures that destroys 50-90% of shareholder value.<p>Sound familiar? This fate awaits all these companies:<p>- Dell: I don&#x27;t even know what Dell makes anymore. I guess they sell PCs, servers and consulting services to small businesses that don&#x27;t know any better. But this market is being eroded by an army of local MSPs and resellers, and it&#x27;s not a model that benefits from scale.<p>- HP: HP has been a disaster for a while, but they will probably endure since their hardware is generally pretty good and reasonably priced. But servers and printers are not a very high-margin business, and that&#x27;s caused their leadership to be constantly on the hunt for a newer, higher-margin revenue stream.<p>- EMC: Storage is increasingly distributed, and EMC&#x27;s centralized storage solutions really are a dinosaur in today&#x27;s market. They just make the wrong product and never found anything to replace it.<p>- Cisco: By all rights, Cisco shouldn&#x27;t be on this list given that the Internet still largely runs on their hardware. But they convinced themselves they were a consulting company, and that ran off all their good engineers. Cisco today is a shadow of its former self.",1444659279

So, now (when I&#x27;m only stupid), let me tell you this - question do you vote or not is pointless. Only when you ask for motives right after makes any sense. Because those two questions can show who you are and what your politicals class is.<p>There is quite pleasant theory about what political systems are. It state that you can represent all political systems as segment, on which both ends are dictatorship and democracy. But, this theory also states that those two systems are unachievable in our world, they are like asymptotes - all political systems tends towards them, but never actually get there. If you take a look at democracy - even Greek democracy weren&#x27;t this perfect one - yeah, everybody could vote. Except for a women, those who hasn&#x27;t finished their army service, those who haven&#x27;t got status of a citizen and those who were slaves.<p>Having this in mind, I personaly always go to elections and always vote. Sometimes - in local elections - I know who had done something for my district or city, and this gives me clear options. This man did this and that, he seems fair and honest, he claims he can do few things better - yup, I&#x27;ll give him my vote so he can try his best. Other times - especially when it comes to parliment or presiden elections I go to election but I don&#x27;t have clear options. I don&#x27;t know those people and to be truly honest - most of them has been on political scene for far to long - so I don&#x27;t vote for them who have the biggest election budgets. And it happened twice to this day - I made invalid votes on purpose. Here, in Poland, we can&#x27;t add our option to the vote card. There were two cases where none of candidates on my voting card weren&#x27;t good enough to have my voice, so I write my types down which made my voice invalid.<p>What does the first paragraph have to do with the second? I choose people who will drag our political system towards this version of political system which is nearest my opinions and preference.<p>And to all people who say that qoing to election won&#x27;t change antyhing - yes, it will. But it require some maturity and effort. It require to make a choice and quite possibly to regret given voice. And then it require consideration - &quot;who I&#x27;ll vote for if my previous choice was bad?&quot;. In some sense it&#x27;s quite biblical - be hot or be cold, not lukewarm. But... this would mean handling the consequences of our choice, and we humans don&#x27;t like to do that...",1444659273

One could imagine a massive solar plan in the Sahara that was using its output to produce diesel fuel. Transporting diesel long distances is more feasible than transporting electricity and you can use it when you need it and store it when you don&#x27;t.<p>If one of the several fusion efforts start generating excess energy this is one way to use that energy productively. You reduce airborne CO2 (good for the climate) and you produce fuel for later.[1]<p>Compressed CO2 is also used in a number of industrial processes so you can just sell the stuff if you want to make back money.<p>[1] And yes that re-releases CO2 into the air but if you&#x27;re pulling it out to make it the result is a net-zero impact on CO2 levels in the atmosphere.",1444658415

4620825,comment,4618808,4620118,1,0,lesaker,,,"Mind explaining your issue with single packet auth? Port knocking by definition is an extra layer of security through obscurity, in that gaining access requiring hitting the sequence of ports to ""knock"". Depending on the implementation, this either is very vulnerable to MITM/sniffing attacks (static knock sequence) or quickly gets really complicated (fully dynamic knock sequence).<p>SPA, by contrast, uses actual crypto to securely authenticate the user with the server. I'm a fan of fwknop, which uses GPG to sign a request packet which is read and understood by the server. It protects against 0 day attacks on OpenSSH, lets me drop 22 inbound to eliminate all those pesky attackers, and allows me to securely authenticate with the fwknopd.",1349539167
4620824,comment,4620423,4620423,28,0,tikhonj,,,"I've been playing around with some Greenarray[1] chips lately, and I have to admit that the core ideas are fascinating. Their particular variant of Forth is actually almost pleasant to use--certainly better than MIPS, which is my closest point of reference. (Ignoring crazy things like the color of identifiers controlling your program's semantics.) The chips are also <i>extremely</i> power efficient.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.greenarraychips.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenarraychips.com/</a><p>I've found having a mental model of a stack-based system far easier than even a simple register-based one.

Well, maybe I AM in the top 1% of developers, though I don't know how anyone could measure that. But the point is I got here through passion. And the point of my reply is that passion IS relevant to this discussion.<p>And that it's only not relevant to people who don't experience it with regard to programming. Honestly, I don't know if someone who doesn't experience passion can CHANGE that; you're passionate about what you're passionate about, and telling yourself to obsess about something seems like it just wouldn't work.<p>So don't take this as any kind of criticism; I'm not saying you're Doing It Wrong. Just that passion DOES make a difference; when you have it, you have no reason to listen to people who tell you that you'll be irrelevant and no one will hire you when you're 45, because you'll be keeping yourself relevant out of habit. Just don't claim that it's not relevant in general, because it is. Climbing to the top of ANY profession or other endeavor really requires it; the most obvious example being Olympic athletes, who typically don't start out at the top of their sport, but achieve the top by being more passionate (and therefore obsessive) about practicing.<p>It makes me want more terms for ""programmer"" or ""developer"" (and not including ""rock star"", which has connotations that annoy people). There's such a range of skill encompassed by those terms that they're practically useless, and they spawn debates like the above where people have 15 different ideas what a ""programmer"" is (in yours, I'm in the top 1%, and in mine, I hang out with ""typical"" developers, and yet a lot of people I know work on interesting projects with an option to contract). Heck, pretty much everyone at Google is in a similar situation, in that they can (typically) switch projects easily if they get bored. And there are far too many developers at Google for all of them to be in the top 1%, I think.",1349538196

Brooks claims it's 9 times as much effort as making something that ""works for me"".  If you can't amortise that over many users, it's usually not worth doing the job properly.<p>But if it's just for you, you don't need all that polish, right? Well, no.  If you are standing on the shoulders of giants, it's really helpful if those giants are stable, function as you expect, interact correctly with other tools, and have clear documentation for when you've forgotten the details (writing it yourself doesn't make your memory perfect).  SOTSOG is really important for building complex systems, because it enables you to push down details to a lower level of abstraction, so you have less clutter to deal with. It's getting the abstractions right that is so difficult (we've all seen it done wrong).<p>There are huge advantages to using standardized systems, that have been improved, tested, documented etc by others.  If you want to do something different, it's very helpful if you can start with standardized components around the new part, so you can just concentrate on the interesting stuff, and not need to build the whole world from scratch.  Of course, the existing stuff is not perfect - the question is whether it's worth it for you to spend the time needed to make something better.<p>Some issues in assessing this argument:  These are ideas have been around for a long time, but haven't taken off.  Highly modifiable systems like lisp, despite having clever and devoted users, lack the standardized libraries of less flexible languages like Java.<p>But there is one kind of area where such systems are absolutely brilliant - exploration at the systems level.  Many (most?) programming language ideas have been developed in lisp, even though did not become popular in that form, because lisp is great for language exploration, but not for standardization.  Similarly, an OS that can be modified on the fly, is great for exploring OS ideas.  You can iterate quickly, see the results and so on.<p>Of course, it seems possible that one could have it both ways - a highly flexible system that also had standardized components. But that doesn't seem to happen.  Flexibility and  standardization are natural enemies, both in differences in the tools that support them... and the kinds of people who use those tools.<p>BTW: There's a middle way. Create tools that can be standardized on. i.e. libraries, frameworks, engines, DSLs.

($300+$99)/$3500 is >10%, which is still an interesting figure to be able to trot about at conferences (especially if you try to estimate the money spent on Macs).<p>(If I were to try to undermine the math in this argument, I'd probably do so from a different angle: the $99 is not pure profit, as Apple has employees scanning over the contracts and vetting corporate accounts; the fixed per-signup costs need to be removed.)<p>(Additionally, I question whether the average developer buys the most expensive device Apple offers, or instead purchases an iPod touch to use only for development; and then, keeps the iPod touch for longer than a year. A bi-yearly iPod touch would destroy this math.)",1349537677

The conclusions are wrong.<p>First, the article assumes each developer creates one app (160,000 * 8700 = $1.392B revenues, $1.392 * 30% = $418mil ""profit"").  This error leads to further errors down the line.<p>Second, Apple App Store sales is estimated to hit apx $4.9B 2012 [1].  This means apx $1,470mil in gross income (what the article calls ""profit"").  The article uses only $1.39B revenues and $418mil in gross income in its calculations as outlined in point one.<p>Third, this analysis assumes every developer would not purchase an iPhone if they were not developing software.  Given that the vast majority of iOS developers do it part time, I think this assumption is highly unlikely.<p>Fourth, including profit from phones as a % of appstore profits is just wrong.  Phone profits are not included as part of appstore profits.  Thus it cannot be used as a % of it.  It is <i>additional</i> income, on top of the appstore.<p>Finally, just to give you an idea of how little profits from developer matter...  In the last 4 reported quarters, Apple earned a pre-tax net income of $49,000mil.  Or $134mil per day.  This versus the article's $64mil over the entire year from developers.

The thing that bugs me though is that the list of websites doesn't expand beyond three sites- you have to scroll to see the fourth site. Shouldn't the list dialog expand to fit all the sites?",1349535874

4620687,comment,4620385,4620618,3,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"There's another thread that makes the same case: these things are not old.<p>As far as I know, we come from clan-like nomads, varying between a alpha-male-harem model with young males on the outskirts and a pair-bonding model with young males striking out on their own. That means that those in your clan have generally had a very close and intimate view of your activities -- and you of theirs. But also that 1) clans were by necessity small, and 2) you always had the ability to walk away. Village life gets a little more complicated, but there is a span of control issue at work: you simply can only be concerned with so many things at the same time. People who are not physically near you have privacy from your oversight. In fact, much of human social behavior is about the trading of information about other people, their thoughts and behaviors. The trust engendered forms alliances and creates a communal atmosphere.<p>The state of nature is that I can choose to talk away from any group of humans. Once I am several hundred meters away, whatever I am doing is anonymous and private. I can choose to share something with one or a few special friends. I can choose not to share something with somebody who has offended me. And so on.<p>But now it's possible to be concerned with millions of things at the same time. Computers can watch millions very closely. You can't walk away from a group of humans and have privacy and anonymity. The system will track you. Your call phone, for instance, has capabilities that make it more or less something akin to a cross between a surveillance device and a wildlife tracking tag. The natural limits that draconian states have over their people are melting away. That's completely new.<p>So yes, we've always been social creatures, but society has been defined by the physical and natural limits on cognition and communication. What we're turning into is not just a more social version of man. It's something completely different. As the other commenter pointed out, it's really more savage than social.",1349535844

The goal of this author's post is to demonstrate to people how the App Store is not Apple's profit center, but still comes from a place of surprise: as I have analyzed this many times, I hoped to drive this home for anyone (and hopefully remove any remaining surprise or question). Sadly, people seem to believe that the only motive someone could have in such a situation is to correct or call out, despite my post not ever saying the original post was wrong and talking about a different number.",1349535656

I meant that the record companies ask for enough money that the company can stay in business but so much that they make a big profit.<p>Personally I think the amount artists get paid by streaming services is wrong. $0.003 and even less per stream is what I've seen but we also must remember that artists signed to the major labels get paid a much higher cut due to deals they make with the streaming services. I think the services would work best if artists/labels could opt-in and the price per stream was fixed for all artists ($0.02 per play seems fair to me).",1349535616

I consume a lot more music now, that I wouldn't have otherwise.  Spotify has got more money out of me than the sum of all my other music related spending.  It's very possible I am an outlier though.",1349535610

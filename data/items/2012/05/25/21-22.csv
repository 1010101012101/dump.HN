You have to delve into the filesystem using libguestfs, and make some pretty complex changes.<p>As you say, the other difficulty is copying gigabytes of data across clouds.  My colleague at Red Hat wrote snap[2] which can turn Linux guests into digests (basically a base distro name and list of packages and list of config changes), so this can be reduced massively.  We're currently extending this work to support Windows and more Linux guest types.<p>[1] <a href=""http://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mo.morsi.org/blog/node/347"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mo.morsi.org/blog/node/347</a>",1337983180

I was just pointing out examples where foundaries produce variations of the same typeface to account for differences between media.<p>Anyway, as long as such differences exist, I don't think we'll be able to convince type designers to disregard them. They want their fonts to look perfect <i>now</i>, they're not going to wait for smartphone manufacturers to catch up, and they already have the skills and tools to produce subtle variations of their typefaces.<p>A truly sustainable solution would be for every reading device to have 300ppi+ screens so that it doesn't really matter how you shade the last subpixel. Until we have that, leaving optimization to perfectionist type designers seems to me like a better stopgap measure than trying to standardize on one or another antialiasing algorithm across vastly different platforms.<p>Different vendors like Microsoft and Apple use antialiasing algorithms that are not only technically different but also based on different UI paradigms. (MS emphasizes crispness whereas Apple emphasizes preserving shapes.) Neither is obviously superior to the other, and the choice is to some extent a matter of taste. So it should be the designer's prerogative to decide whether to follow either paradigm or to disregard both and enforce his own aesthetic tastes.",1337982797

4025495,comment,4023484,4024508,34,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Who saves lives? Doctors? Medical researches? People who feed the hungry?<p>Consider something such as a weather satellite. What goes into such a system? What inventions and breakthroughs are responsible for its existence? Things like CCD imagers, micro-chips, and, yes, rockets. Are the inventors of such things savers of lives? Surely yes, because it is through weather satellites that we are able to track and monitor hurricanes, typhoons and other severe weather phenomena which historically have been great killers of lives. Today hurricanes do not hit land by surprise, we have enough time to warn people so that they can evacuate or hunker down. Over the years this has saved perhaps millions of lives. Are vulcanologists life savers? Sometimes they are. What about automobile manufacturers? Well, without automobiles it would take a lot longer for EMTs to get to people who are injured and a lot longer to get them to a hospital, so a lot more people would surely be dead without automobiles. If you were to see a construction worker digging up the road to work on the sewer would you think of that man as a life saver? He most surely is though because clean running water and sewer systems are some of the most effective methods of reducing the spread of disease. That man isn't just digging up the street he's helping to keep you free from cholera, as surely as any doctor or medical researcher would.<p>Reality is a lot more complicated and intermeshed than a naive, simplistic interpretation would indicate. What figure from, say, the 17th century is most responsible for the greatest reduction in untimely deaths since then? Such a question is almost impossible to answer.<p>But more than that, life is about more than merely living. This is the fallacy of Maslow's hierarchy at play here. The idea that an individual who is ill, hungry, in danger, or impoverished must necessarily forgo self-esteem, appreciation of art, romance, and intellectual pursuits. That is a backward and harmful way of approaching the world, whether on an individual level or on the scale of all humanity. Yes there are great problems in the world, we are ill as a people, we are hungry, we are not safe from violence and war. But should we shun poetry, music, and science for that? It is often through introspection and art that we can gain a better understanding of our fellow humans, that we can set aside hatred and bigotry. It is often through the pursuit of science and engineering that we find better ways to treat and prevent disease and to feed the hungry.<p>So I would say that we can and should strive toward putting humans in orbit and on Mars and it is just as noble a thing to do as curing disease or feeding the hungry. Because it represents what humanity is all about, pushing frontiers, exploration, knowledge, adventure. It is those things which make life worth living and give greater potency to more direct efforts of saving lives (just as the existence of art, food, and music do). And they also give us new perspectives. The photograph of the Earth from the moon by the Apollo 8 astronauts has been enormously inspirational throughout history, for example. Perhaps along the way who knows what new technology will come about. And, of course, more than likely we will develop the technology to divert asteroids away from Earth (perhaps saving billions of lives) and also make Earth a multi-planetary species, which could save human civilization from utter annihilation at some point.",1337982653

4025479,comment,4025198,4025281,15,0,elimisteve,,,"I also use Go.  Roughly 80% of the code I write is still Python (Django apps), but there are times when Go just makes the most sense... so that's what I use.<p>Whenever speed is key, I use Go.  Its concurrency primitives are dead simple.  It has excellent support for cutting-edge technologies like WebSockets and SPDY (these libraries/""packages"" were written by Google), as well as MongoDB (see ""mgo"").<p>I'm using Go in production (for an almost-complete MVP).  For a telephony app I had to dial 100 simultaneous phone numbers to bring people into conference calls.  Trying that in Python maxed out my EC2 instance's resources.  I had to kill and restart it from the AWS web interface.<p>Then I rewrote that part in Go.  I was staring at the output of htop (similar to top) when it ran and thought something was wrong; it used a few megs of RAM, no noticeable CPU, and finished in 0.59 seconds _on a micro instance_.  Now you can see why Google wanted such a language!<p>I never appreciated static typing (""who wants to go from Python to Java or C++?"") until Go, which makes very heavy use of type inferencing.  The upshot is you'll find yourself declaring types 0 times instead of twice in Java.  In Python and Ruby you don't declare them at all, resulting in type errors _all over the place_ and programs that run ~20 times slower; see <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=yarv&lang2=go"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=al...</a>.<p>The Go compiler tells me which lines contain the type errors.  Usually my program is correct once these errors are gone.  Can't say the same for Python, whose apps can run for days before a corner case is hit, exposing a type error that would've been caught at compile time in Go.<p>It's interesting that you mentioned Clojure.  Well, it's powerful alright, but I found it to be extremely complicated (does a language _really_ need 4 kinds of concurrency and to consist of literally 500 functions?)<p>If you believe as I do -- as do most who appreciate small, simple, but extremely powerful languages like Python and C -- that simplicity is a feature, you will love Go.  If you love Java, C++, D, and other huge languages, consider those or something like Scala or Clojure instead.  IMO, doing so means giving up clarity/comprehensibility for a longer list of features, almost all of which _can_ be useful, but all of which make mastering the language much more difficult.<p>Go has been my favorite language for about a year now.  Its only weakness is lack of library and/or framework support, which is an occasional bummer.<p>That said, I very strongly recommend giving Go a try if you haven't already.  I played with Clojure for months till it finally made sense and I saw how powerful it _could_ be, but I still couldn't do anything with it that I couldn't do in Python.<p>After 2 hours with Go (1.5 years ago), I wrote my first ever concurrent program... _trivially_.  This can not be stressed enough.  Want a function call to `f` to be non-blocking? Type `go f()`.  Yes, it's that simple.  Launch a couple functions like that, and bam, you're doing extremely efficient concurrent programming.<p>If you want the convenience of Python or Ruby plus the speed and type safety of C++, give it a shot! <a href=""http://golang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org</a>",1337982307

I'm a great fan of space exploration, in all forms - observation, robotic, and human - but this docking is simply <i>not</i> a significant event. Not in space exploration terms, and not in the grander scheme of human activity. It is neither a scientific nor a societal accomplishment, it showcases neither innovation nor courage. It's just - something that happened. Something that happened roughly on a monthly basis until a few months ago. I don't care.<p>I think a great deal of the enthusiasm stems from the fact that it's a private company doing this, and not a government. Well, I'm most emphatically <i>not</i> enthusiastic about that. In fact, it smells rather dystopian. Governments can, with care, be kept under control. However bad corruption gets, democratic governments will always be bound to the electorate. Corporations - no. I don't want space exploration to be led by a private company, and certainly not by a small group of insanely rich individuals. As much as I admire Elon Musk - and Jeff Bezos, and all the others trying to get us back into space - these people are not the ones who ought to be leading us.<p>Part of my discomfort with this course of events is no doubt just my personal political views - I'm about as far left as you can go. But what's happening also reminds me of some of Heinlein's stories - when space exploration was fueled by money, human rights (especially the collective right of self determination) fell by the wayside.<p>If the cost of going to space is the permanent privatization of exploration, I can't be enthusiastic about it.",1337980405

This (a) makes it harder to learn each individual part, (b) makes composing those parts to meet personal needs more difficult, and (c) makes it so learning those tools doesnt point toward anything greater  you cant take what you learn with you to new environments that werent anticipated by the original tool authors. Additionally, these kinds of tools tend to isolate users from the systems underneath, creating dependency. I much prefer when tool-builders think long and hard about making simple, orthogonal tools, designed to be composed together to meet diverse needs. As long as the individual components are explorable, such tools teach their users more fundamental concepts and allow them to grow over time.<p>When implemented well, an environment like Coda can be very productive in the niches for which it was designed, but in only offering a standard workspace and set of tools to everyone, it denies users the chance to build their own workspaces and pick & hone their own tools. This infantilizes and shelters those users, limiting them in the longer term.",1337980130

I also rely on watching who is speaking for lip-reading, facial language, and body language; putting those together with what I hear creates a ""complete"" input for me. For TV, I rely on captioning, and on subtitles for DVDs. I don't listen to the radio, or much music.<p>The web is great for communicating and learning because it's very visual, but podcasts and screencasts, despite possibly being of interest, aren't much good to me.<p>I prefer to do most conversing in person; over the phone it's far too easy to miss something, or confuse one sound or word for another (letters: b, c, d, g, e; numbers: 15, 50 (pronunciation)). Heavy accents are quite challenging to handle over the phone. I've had to have another person help me with telephone calls for official things such as banking, gov't matters, etc.<p>I'm a university student. In small classes hearing isn't too bad, but larger classes in lecture halls are much harder to follow. It's easier when the teacher is doing most of the talking, and harder when it's a more interactive class, with students contributing.<p>In a working context, clear communication is important. Even in person it's easy to miss a key word or phrase, or confuse one for another. Not only that, but I once interviewed for a web developer position, and was openly discriminated against when my hearing difficulty was revealed. The interview didn't go past this point; I could have done the job with my skill set, but the boss made an issue out of my hearing.<p>I'm a very visual person: I like to see, to read, to write, and to draw. Being an avid reader, I enjoy novels and other reading materials, including the web. I'm mostly self-taught in web development by reading tutorials and books and reviewing code by other people.<p>In closing, loss of hearing, whether partial or complete, raises barriers to work, education, socializing, etc. They can be worked around to some extent, but they are still they, and as I found out can actively harm you.",1337979825

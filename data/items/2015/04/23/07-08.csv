Then department stores came out in the late 1800s; they were revolutionary at the time in letting the customer do their own shopping and only offering assistance if you specifically asked.  Department stores begat catalog retail, where there was no human, you just placed an order by mail and it was shipped to you.  Catalog retail begat e-commerce, where the catalogs were placed online and the retailers dispensed with stores entirely.  E-commerce begat the sharing economy, where <i>in specific verticals</i> you could just plug your search into your phone and a delivery person would appear with your items.  Now the sharing economy has generated concierge services, where you tell the shopkeeper what you want, he goes behind the (virtual) counter, assembles your items, and he (or rather some abstracted, unnamed delivery person) hands them to you.  All over your mobile phone network, of course.",1429775977

I remember deobfuscation tools being consistently released and updated, but I left the runescape scene for warcraft before I could that far involved.<p>I have a friend who worked on anti-cheat technology for a very  well known gaming company. He in fact started off selling hacks for said company and was hired to protect against them many years later. It was entertaining because part of his job was to maintain his old aliases and create new ones and frequent all the hacking forums and IRC channels to listen in on all the discussions. He would even sometimes contribute random information as part of his ruse. The best part is when his team would leave secret messages to hack developers (like in the byte patterns of the signature scans or embedded within the anti-cheat modules that were being mapped into memory).  They had a great sense of humor and the hacking community picked up on it and loved it.<p>I think coming from our background and having to work in a security capacity like that would be fun as hell.

We could write a function of that signature, but that would imply that the caller/context would choose what type of Map it returns (and so it would not depend on the integer argument.)<p>Think about what it means if a type variable has no typeclass constraint: the type <i>t</i> isn&#x27;t just a specific unknown type, it&#x27;s literally <i>any</i> type. Similarly, <i>C t => t</i> isn&#x27;t a specific unknown instance of a typeclass, it&#x27;s <i>any</i> instance of that typeclass. If we tell Haskell that we&#x27;re returning an instance <i>C t => t</i> and then try to give some concrete type, Haskell won&#x27;t allow it, because it wants that type to encompass any possible type that implements <i>C</i>, not just the one we happened to use.<p>One way of making the above code work in Haskell is to use an existential type, which expresses that we&#x27;re talking about <i>some</i> (not <i>any</i>) map type, but we&#x27;d have to wrap it inside a different constructor:<p><pre><code>    -- this expresses that a SomeMap constructor contains some kind\n    -- if Map, but we can&#x27;t tell which one:\n    data SomeMap = SomeMap (forall m.

Some of the reasons I think this should be regulated:<p>1. Currently there are tons of startups out there that found a name, want to start their startup and then they get hold back because a domain shark just bought their name. These sharks then ask a huge amount of money just to annoy everyone out there.<p>2. .com domains are getting rarer each day and harder to come by. Because of these sharks there a lot of rare domains are out there just to be sold for a ridiculous amount of money, therefor these domains just stay &quot;parked&quot; until they expire again.<p>3. This Cybersquatting is exactly the same as selling drugs, only this time they sell domains. They pick them up cheap, get addicted to doing it so they keep doing it. With the sole purpose off making money with it. This is completely done in bad faith and does not contribute to this society.<p>Because of these simple points we are currently looking at a world that is stopping it&#x27;s own growth. People will not have the chance anymore to &quot;try&quot; a startup idea and will get discouraged because of it. The .com tld and soon the .io tld will also become extinct in the years to come because of the huge growth of the internet and it&#x27;s domains. Cybersquatting<p>I think that a possible solution to this would be to let the registrars put limits on the amount of domains you can buy. When buying a domain people should also provide their ID too ensure this limit gets followed.<p>I posted this here to ask other people&#x27;s opinion about this matter and hope this gets resolved in the years to come.",1429773842

I take issue with the idea that human being can be improved, specifically with the word ""improved"" or any other such term used instead.  Improved is subjective at best and totally repulsive when one considers what ""improved"" might actually mean to those defining an improvement (Nazi eugenics program).  Human nature is such that any human designed program to selectively breed human beings will ultimately become a gross perversion, since the program would require institutionalization, planned breeding, castration and outright murder.  We humans tend to be somewhat ethical and decent on an individual level but on a social or national level we're repulsive, greedy, disgusting monsters.  Frankly, we can't trust ourselves.",1216939993

255952,comment,255729,255729,0,0,donw,,,"The point that most Linux users and developers seem to miss is not that a good user interface needs to be pretty -- it needs to be consistent.  Sure, the stylish looks of OS X do a lot to woo people to the platform, but the experience is why people stay.<p>Consistency is the area where Linux fails miserably.  Perhaps this is due to the lack of a single visionary who leads the way in Linux desktop development, but I'd say the problem lies more in the 'not built here' mentality of the developers.  Which is kind of ironic, because the entire point of free software was that anybody could contribute to improving it.<p>Consider this: Think of your top ten Linux applications, and the GUI toolkits they use to handle their interaction with X11.  I'll wager that, out of those ten applications, you can probably list four or five different GUI toolkits, each of which works <i>slightly</i> differently.  Why isn't there just one <i>really good</i> GUI toolkit?<p>I think the answer lies in pride -- everybody wants to have 'their' project, so they start their own, rather than contributing to an existing codebase.  For the same reason, open-source project maintainers often do an awful job of listening to their users and co-developers, because their pride of being at the head of the train is threatened by other people making key decisions.<p>This pride also extends out into assuming that the user of said application <i>wants</i> to be an expert in its use, which leads to overly complicated preference panes, nonsense confirmation dialogues, and so on.<p>This is why Linux applications often have the most appallingly inconsistent interfaces, and sadly, I can't think of a good solution to the problem.  Frankly, I wish I could, because I would love to run Debian Linux on a Lenovo tablet, and have a GUI that is as useful for me as OS X.",1216939834

Maybe dhh is worried that pg's talking about risk is too discouraging for many people who would be happier as entrepreneurs but remain scared in their cubicle life. On the other hand pg might be worried that people end up not pushing themselves hard enough and ultimately failing and staying mediocre.<p>Since dhh was a speaker at Startup School I also assume they get along fine and we simply benefit from a kind of benign competiton.<p>Probably they are both right, what I would like to know now is which course of action has the bigger chance of success ;-)<p>Nevertheless I also feel pointing to the CEOs who stayed with their company might be inaccurate. Jeff Bezos might still be with Amazon, but he might not be much into selling books. He might be exploring things like the Kindle and Amazon Web Services, or something entirely different.

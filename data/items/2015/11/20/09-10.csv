Probably not, but people needing a provably NSA-resistant chat client is such a tiny percentage of the people interested in regular chatting. None of the warnings I see have the nuance of &quot;don&#x27;t use it if you think it&#x27;ll keep you safe from the government, but otherwise it&#x27;s a pretty nice service to use&quot; nor do they list the chat services that they feel are more secure.<p>Compared to the alternatives of Skype, WhatsApp, SMS, Hangouts, iMessage, etc it&#x27;s a good chat service, with a relatively lightweight native client on multiple platforms, actual working sync, and good recovery when used on poor Internet connection.",1448013564

10600461,comment,10583306,10598687,0,0,gd1,,,">No it&#x27;s not, since with the houses it would be easy to verify that there&#x27;s no 3 houses available. The trader in the Nanex article had no way to know how many of the 24800 shares were actually available. He&#x27;s trading at an information disadvantage.<p>You are correct, public markets are anonymous by design, so there is no way to <i>tell</i> that the same liquidity is being offered in more than one place.  That doesn&#x27;t change the reality that it is.  As I explained, it must be, or the transition from 1 exchange to 13 exchanges would have seen offered liquidity by market makers cut to 1/13th.<p>So like I said, anyone with a working mental model of the market knows this.  You can&#x27;t just aggregate displayed liquidity at each venue and think that number is valid. It doesn&#x27;t matter what your &#x27;screen&#x27; is telling you if the screen is doing something that makes no sense. No one ever  pretended that you can magically execute on different exchanges as if they were one exchange.  No one ever made that guarantee. The only people who think that are wingnuts like Eric.<p>And since we are talking about an issue that only effects people sending very large orders to multiple exchanges, the likes of Katsuyama have no excuses for their ignorance.  They are paid to be on top of these details.  You can&#x27;t have a &#x27;trader&#x27; in the modern age who doesn&#x27;t know what a millisecond is, or isn&#x27;t prepared or capable to dig below one abstraction layer.  &quot;dUh, my screen say 24800 shares are there and i pressed buy&quot; is not what you pay an execution trader for.  It is his fucking job to know what happens when his order goes down the wire.<p>>To your analogy, it would be similar to a real estate agent flooding the market with multiple listings of each house, but with different pictures and different addresses, giving the impression of a buyers market to a buyer (phantom liquidity).<p>They are not &quot;flooding the market&quot; or trying to present &quot;phantom liquidity&quot;.  They are doing exactly what you do when you put the house on 3 different websites.  Trying to increase your chances of finding a customer.  They are forced to put bids and offers on 13 different exchanges, because that is US equity market structure.  It&#x27;s no fun.  Life would be a lot simpler if there were just one exchange.  As I explained, it&#x27;s like playing russian roulette for them... they are now forced to take the chance that they may get filled simultaneously on multiple exchanges and take on more risk than they are comfortable holding.  But they are forced to do that since their customers are now spread  across 13 exchanges.  Market makers would like nothing better than to have 1 exchange.  Arbitrageurs are the ones who love having all this fragmentation.",1448013454

10600447,comment,10589615,10600243,0,0,jackgavigan,,,"I completely agree. Leaving a gap and waiting for someone to fill it is practically the <i>opposite</i> of management.<p><i>> ..once employees know this is a short cut for promotion, they will focus a lot of their energy and attention to find &#x27;the void&#x27; and try to fill it, or act like they can fill it, thus neglecting the real work that need to be done.</i><p>This in particular is really dangerous because it can poison an organisation&#x27;s culture. For example, imagine Ben decides to focus on managing upwards in an effort to get Adam to promote him. Meanwhile, he neglects his duties, forcing his team-mates to pick up the slack. They start getting annoyed at Ben because he&#x27;s not pulling his weight.<p>It&#x27;s not uncommon, in my experience (and I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m at risk of stereo-typing here), for good, smart, conscientious people in technical roles to focus first on doing the job that they&#x27;ve been assigned and trust that management will recognise and reward them for doing so (and, conversely, punish anyone who slacks off), <i>and</i> that one of those rewards is that they will be considered for any opportunity for promotion that arises. Unfortunately, that doesn&#x27;t always happen.<p>If Adam promotes Ben, his old team-mates are going to be <i>really</i> pissed off. From their perspective, Ben&#x27;s bad behaviour has been rewarded, instead of rectified. Meanwhile, the extra work they&#x27;ve been putting in to make up for that bad behaviour has been completely ignored.<p>The end result is an unhappy team, They&#x27;ll resent both Ben and Adam, their productivity will probably drop (because whey the hell should they work their asses off when they&#x27;re clearly not going to be rewarded for it?), and may well start looking elsewhere for work.<p>In that scenario, Adam has <i>not</i> done a good job as a manager, and he&#x27;s <i>definitely</i> not a good leader.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with identifying a gap and opening a dialogue about how it can be filled (including asking if anyone&#x27;s interested in filling it) but if someone moves to plug a gap, that generally means that they&#x27;re going to leave a gap somewhere else. A good manager needs to make sure that they understand the implications of shifting people around, and explicitly recognise the indirect contribution that Ben&#x27;s old team-mates are making to fill the gap.<p>Organisations are about teams, not individuals. It&#x27;s astounding how many managers fail to grasp that.",1448013029

From the wreckage of a Northeast car fire investigators pulled the remnants of a black plastic bag. The company supplied their black bags to just two shops in the D.C. area. Investigators put cameras in both stores.<p>With the cooperation of the owner of the two Circle 7 stores, agents affixed thumbnail-size stainless steel chips to the bottom of every bag in both stores. Each chip was marked according to alphanumeric code, going in order through the stack. If one of the bags were to be involved\nin a fire, the chip would survive. And because agents went to the stores daily to track which bags had been used, they would be able to go to the video to see which customer had purchased the bag from the fire.&quot;<p>The above was not how the arsonist was caught.

Assuming they ran all 3 chains in parallel this is still a really long time to wait for an analysis. (edit: just checked, looks like they used 700+ sequences, so this is closer to 1-3 months of compute time)<p>The standard number of samples for phylogenetic analyses is 1,000-10,000 samples, trending towards the smaller as the phylogenies get larger. Since they did 3 independent analyses and combined their samples, as long as they assessed convergence and ensured that all 3 chains were converged this is likely fine. Excluding burnin is also quite typical since the MCMC move operators for phylogenetics are not very good due to the high dimensionality of the search space. ABC is also challenging to work with due to the high dimensionality (though I admit I haven&#x27;t worked much with these methods in phylogenetics)<p>Typically in this field it is not enough to say &quot;you didn&#x27;t run your MCMC chains for long enough&quot; or anything like that. Of course the chains should be run for longer -- theoretically speaking they should be run for infinite amount of time, but there are routine disagreements over whether 100 or 1000 effective samples are sufficient for phylogenetics. But unless there is a serious model inadequacy that the authors haven&#x27;t addressed there&#x27;s typically no reason to nitpick about these sorts of things.

It needs one RTT of data at the receiver to cope with waiting for a retransmission of a lost packet, or just so it doesn&#x27;t drop incoming packets when the receiving app doesn&#x27;t read immediately.  The same amount of data must be buffered at the sender because it may need to be retransmitted if a packet was lost.  So, 6MiB of buffering with a fairly typical 100ms RTT gives you 6*8/0.1 Mbit/s = 480Mbit/s.  In practice you may need more buffering than this, but that&#x27;s the maximum rate you can achieve.<p>Now, if you&#x27;ve got an overbuffered router at the bottleneck, as is common on home broadband links, you can build a queue there.  It&#x27;s not really all that unusual to see queues build to 1 second, especially on ADSL.  If you&#x27;ve a 1 second RTT, the maximum rate you can support with 6MiB of buffering at both sender and receiver drops to 48Mbit/s.  It seems to me that 6MiB is a fairly reasonable default value, though if you&#x27;re running a really busy server, you might benefit from reducing this, especially if you&#x27;re mostly serving small files.",1448010867

I tried finding a short quote that sums it up, be instead I&#x27;ll paste a wall of text:<p><i>And so if the word is basically &#x27;ISIS&#x27;, but in Arabic, why are the people it describes in such a fury about it? Because they hear it, quite rightly, as a challenge to their legitimacy: a dismissal of their aspirations to define Islamic practice, to be &#x27;a state for all Muslims’ and – crucially – as a refusal to acknowledge and address them as such. They want to be addressed as exactly what they claim to be, by people so in awe of them that they use the pompous, long and delusional name created by the group, not some funny-sounding made-up word. And here is the very simple key point that has been overlooked in all the anglophone press coverage I’ve seen: in Arabic, acronyms are not anything like as widely used as they are in English, and so arabophones are not as used to hearing them as anglophones are. Thus, the creation and use of a title that stands out as a nonsense neologism for an organisation like this one is inherently funny, disrespectful, and ultimately threatening of the organisation’s status. Khaled al-Haj Salih, the Syrian activist who coined the term back in 2013, says that initially even many of his fellow activists, resisting Daesh alongside him, were shocked by the idea of an Arabic acronym, and he had to justify it to them by referencing the tradition of acronyms being used as names by Palestinian organisations (such as Fatah). So saturated in acronyms are we in English that we struggle to imagine this, but it’s true.<p>All of this means that the name lends itself well to satire, and for the arabophones trying to resist Daesh, humour and satire are essential weapons in their nightmarish struggle. But the satirical weight of the word as a weapon, in the hands of the Syrian activists who have hewn it from the rock of their nightmare reality, does not just consist of the weirdness of acronyms. As well as being an acronym, it is also only one letter different from the word &#x27;daes داعس&#x27; , meaning someone or something that crushes or tramples. Of course that doesn’t mean, as many articles have claimed, that &#x27;daesh&#x27; is &#x27;another conjugation&#x27; of the verb ‘to crush or trample’, nor that that is &#x27;a rough translation of one of the words in the acronym&#x27; – it’s simply one letter different from this other word. Imagine if the acronym of &#x27;Islamic State in Iraq and Syria&#x27; spelt out ‘S.H.I.D’ in English: activists and critics would certainly seize the opportunity to refer to the organisation as ‘shit’ – but I think it’s safe to say that no serious foreign media outlet would claim that &#x27;shit&#x27; was another conjugation of the verb &#x27;shid&#x27;, nor a rough translation of it. Of course, that analogy is an unfair one, given the hegemonic global linguistic position of English, not to mention the heightened currency of scatological words; but there is a serious point to be made here about the anglophone media’s tendency to give up before it’s begun understanding non-European languages.<p>And obviously understanding things outside of English, and explaining them to each other via our (social)media hive mind is hugely important on many levels: in the broadest sense, it allows us to attempt to take our place as global citizens, and feeds our connection to other humans on planet Earth. Sadly, the story of the word &#x27;Daesh&#x27; is neither the only nor even the worst example of anglophone media failing us in this regard. But there’s something specifically important in this particular story which is being overlooked as a result of all the lazy journalism around it: the use of this word is part of a multi-pronged, diverse range of efforts by Arabs and Muslims to reject the terrorists’ linguistic posturing, their pseudo-classical use of Arabic, their claims to Quranic authority and an absolute foundation in sacred scripture, as reflected in their pompous name. This ridiculous claim has of course been masterfully and witheringly deconstructed at the Islamic level, but at the secular level, satire is a crucial weapon in the fight against these maniacs: there is a fertile tradition of Syrian and satire as not only defiance but coping strategy, and which has been quite under-reported. In satirical Arabic media (and conversation) various diminutives of the word have also gone viral – elegantly diminishing their subject, belittling them, patronising and relegating them to a zone beyond any formal naming in a single sweep.</i>",1448010238

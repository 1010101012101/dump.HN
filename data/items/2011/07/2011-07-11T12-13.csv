While Kagan's actions could be considered ""masculine"", most likely if a woman did something similar it would be considered ""bitchy"".<p>Because we use different words and standards, it's really hard to truly reverse the situation.<p>By the way, your example indicates that you're confusing sexism and misogyny -- you could debate whether his position is misogynistic (expresses a hatred for women) but it seems fairly likely that it's sexist (makes some women feel uncomfortable in a situation because of their gender).",1310389086

2750441,comment,2749948,2750311,13,0,lucasjung,,,"I've never thought if the advantages of fusion power in terms of ""more powerful"" than fission, but rather ""less dangerous,"" ""cleaner,"" and ""more sustainable.""<p>The problem with fission is that the fuel is really nasty stuff that requires all kinds of special precautions when you mine it, when you process it, and when you dispose of or recycle it.  Even when you shut down a fission reactor, you still have a bunch of highly radioactive material sitting there that has to be dealt with.  Also, the world will eventually run out of uranium, just like it will eventually run out of fossil fuels.  I'm not going to try and predict exactly when that will happen (I'm guessing probably not in my lifetime), but it <i>will</i> happen eventually.<p>Fusion, on the other hand, uses hydrogen as fuel and leaves you with helium as waste.  I don't know what kind of radioactive isotopes come out of fusion, but I'm willing to bet that, unless you're deliberately trying to produce them, you probably get way less than you do with a fission reactor.  In short, waste disposal for a fusion reactor is trivial compared to a fission reactor, and when you shut down a fusion reactor the radiation hazard pretty much goes away immediately.  Hydrogen is also a lot more common than uranium, so long after all of the uranium is gone we'll still have plenty of hydrogen around.",1310388566

2750438,comment,2749061,2749120,2,0,luismgz,,,"1) Is the JIT standalone? No easy answer. Pypy is a complex project, not just a python implementation. Pypy is a complex toolchain, a framework, for implementing dynamic languages. With pypy, you could write your own implementation of ruby, scheme, php, whatever... And once your interpreter is complete, pypy will generate the JIT automatically for you (you won't need to implement it yourself, you just have to write the interpreter, and pypy will do the rest).\nPypy is writen in Rpython (restricted python) but you can implement any vm with it, for any language you may want.<p>2) How does it compare to c? It's pretty competitive in highly algorithmic code, cpu intensive and numerical tasks. For anything else, it depends. Overall, it on average up to 4 times faster than regular python.<p>3) Why there's still a difference? Pypy is a work in progress. You should compare it to other projects such as v8 or tracemonkey.<p>4) Restricted python: It's the static subset of python used to implement pypy. It takes the place of c in cpython. Yes, it's much faster, but also more limited and less flexible.\nIt's nicer than c, but not as cool as full python.\nYou can also find Shedskin and Cython. Shedskin is a true static subset of python that compiles to c++. Cython is a python-like language that adds type declarations to the language to make it closer to c.<p>Unladen Swallow was a separate project and it's dead now.\nPsyco is the predecessor of pypy.

This would be useful if I wanted a group of people in my sport team / band, since when one of the band already in the group adds someone to this group, everyone in the band can then talk to them; and it's not up to me as the creator to do all the admin.<p>* Owned Group - essentially the same as Group, but with additional security / more like FB's groups.  I specify who's in the group and what access they have - i.e. if they're just a member, or if they can also administrate the group.  This is more useful for application fan pages, where you want a mailing list of people to contact, but only want a few of the people in the group to be able to add / approve new members.  With this model, it would be OK to have an option for non members to request access; then be added once approved.<p>What do you guys think?<p>JB",1310386210

2750311,comment,2749948,2749948,9,0,yaakov34,,,"After actually looking at the numbers and the details regarding fusion technology, I've come to the conclusion that the advantages over fission are illusory.<p>I think people believe that fusion is somehow ""way more powerful"", because they know that fusion bombs are way more powerful than mere atom bombs. Actually, in many of the most powerful fusion bombs, the vast majority of the energy is produced by fission, with fusion serving as only an intermediate step to release neutrons and create more fission. A step you don't need in a reactor, which can control the fission rate itself.<p>My guess is that a lot of people who haven't looked at the numbers think that fusion is hundreds of times more powerful than fission. Well, let's look at those numbers: the fission of a uranium-235 atom produces 202.5 MeV. The fusion of D+T produces only 17.6 MeV. That's more energetic per unit mass of fuel, since D and T are just hydrogen isotopes, but if you do the math, it's only about 3.5 times more energetic even using this measure. And fuel mass is a tiny portion of the mass of the whole powerplant. To make it worse, hydrogen is far less dense than uranium (by a lot more than a factor than 3.5), so you actually end up with a lot more fuel volume and containment volume. There are other reactions than D+T, but none of them look as good as plain old fission. That's before we even get into the fact that for most fusion reactions, a lot of the energy goes into extremely dangerous neutrons.<p>The talk about ""getting the fuel from seawater"" is also misleading. It's technically true, but the process is very expensive, and, if we are going to talk about seawater, uranium can also be extracted from it.<p>Finally, the idea that the danger from proliferation would go away is also false - anything producing a neutron flux as strong as a fusion reactor can be used to produce isotopes suitable for a bomb. And even aneutronic fusion (which is technically even more difficult) can be made to produce neutrons with suitable additions to the fusion fuels.<p>EDIT: P.S. I am not an expert. I do think I can understand numbers and technical arguments, and I would love to hear expert analysis. But one thing: for every technology which you assume will help fusion (such as wonder-containments for the neutrons), please analyze how fission reactors would benefit from it, as well. Then let's see if we can make fusion come out ""better"" than fission in some meaningful sense.<p>EDIT: I can't resist adding that the talk of ""harnessing the reaction that powers the Sun"" is aimed at people who don't know the numbers, and is very annoying. The Sun is not a good model; it has a huge mass (duh), and a tiny surface-to-mass ratio, which is why the energy it produces makes it so bright. But pound-for-pound, the Sun produces a lot less energy than <i>slightly warm chicken soup</i>. Do the math yourself, and be surprised. We can not build a reactor that works like the Sun.",1310386017

Up to that point, Dem & GOP were actually civil to one another. Gingrich made it known that his side of the aisle was not to talk to - I mean that literally - was not to talk to Dems or socialize, bargain, anything at all. The party would deal with that. No personal relationships would be tolerated.<p>&quot;You just don&#x27;t get it&quot;. Remember that phrase? That was Gingrich&#x27;s way of saying, &quot;you believe what we say, or you aren&#x27;t one of us&quot;. He made it clear there was no free-thinking, no wiggle room. This wasn&#x27;t about good governance. This was about rallying the troops to win the Congress and White House.<p>This was, IMHO, the start of the no negotiating, complete polarization period. This was taught not just to the GOP politicians, but to the party followers. There would be no more compromise; this was a war, with only one winner.<p>This simply deteriorated into what we have today. The media did nothing other than pick up the blood scent and run with it; they never drove any of it, and none of it came from personal thoughts of the average American.",1443351487

I&#x27;m not sure if you can even meaningfully derive the algebraic process and meaning from first principles. You should nix the cute mnemonic stories, since those probably serve to confuse people, but the methods themselves are absolutely solid. And the one shown right on the front page (for me) cross multiply is how you divide by fractions. a/b / c/d = a/b * d/c. The fact that 1/a is the reciprocal of a, whatever a is and that 1/(a/b) = b/a should be the first thing you tell people after you tell them about fractions. Then you show why cross multiply works.

""Ooh, that ugly obj-c is so unproductive!"".<p>Currently I'm mainting a couple of medium to big obj-c projects and one big ROR custom CMS. My background was mostly in Python. A few years ago this sharade of writing faster obj-c app started. You guys might have heard of Wax (in Lua) which seemed to have a similar concept to RubyMobtion (of course, w/o the shiny presentation style that comes with the ROR community). After rolling my sleeves and digging into Obj-C (and CocoaTouch), all other alternatives look like made for people who are comfy/lazy and stick to writing in high-level scripting languages. If they admit their status, no problem, just that personally I would not bet medium-to-big project on anything else except plain obj-c.<p>The ""RubyMotion Makes Debugging Easy"" is the silliest part. Good luck on using GDB/LLDB!<p>Note: <i>sharade</i> and other casual language was in no intent meant to discredit the hard work put in by the developers of such tools.

However, I think he's justified his actions pretty well, and that switching to Windows Phone is a big gamble, but not an unreasonable one. I think their decision to immediately drop Meego was questionable, but I can understand why they did it.<p>Before my current android phone, I used Nokia phones for about 5 years. The Nokia phones had great hardware and a good low-level stack, but higher level stack needed a lot of work. If I never use another symbian device, it will be too soon.<p>I think you have to consider how competitive MeeGo would have been against Android / iOS (probably not very - though not for technical reasons) and look at the situation at RIM. RIM kept their own OS, and has suffered for it. I think Nokia put out the Lumia phones to stay reasonably current, which they did, and now they need to release a real ""Nokia Windows Phone,"" that differentiates them.<p>Maybe they can't do it and they'll go under, but I think a lot of the criticism is sour grapes from people who dislike Microsoft or liked Nokia's old phone OS'es.",1336150610

It depends on your knowledge of available primitives: programming languages, libraries. One who knows OpenGL will have an easier time spinning a 3D model than another who parses log files for a living. Similarly, a graph theorist like yourself will find it easier to prove theorems of form 3. than the rest of us. (At least half of th. 2 seems easier though. Suppose N divides (N-1)!+1; none of 2...(N-1) divides (N-1)!+1; so none of 2...(N-1) divides N.)<p>I guess the main confusing part about the Howard-Curry isomorphism is that the code / comment conventions are commonly reversed between proofs and programs. Programs show a sequence of actions, and may show machine state in the comments, e.g.<p>...<p>x = x * f; //x now contains factorial(n)<p>...<p>Proofs show state instead (i.e. the proposition that was proven so far), and may contain the operation in the comments:<p>...<p>(x + y) ^ 2 = (x + y) * (x + y)<p>Using the distributivity of addition:<p>(x + y) ^ 2 = (x + y) * x + (x + y) * y<p>...<p>In either case, you:<p>- start with an initial state<p>- choose a sequence of operations from an existing set<p>- end up with a desired state<p>If either your program or proof has bugs, there are certain initial states that will break some step in the operation sequence and cause an undesired final state.",1336150346

As an example, I would actually find it really useful if the iPhone's autocorrect was smart enough to realize that my fingers were slightly off position as I typed (due to the lack of physical feedback) and could figure out what word I meant to type. However, it seems to just be running a spell check; it doesn't even realize that if I mash at the screen four times I intend to have four letters and it should not autocorrect what I typed to a word with five letters because it seems to be spelled similarly. The result is that a slight offset on the keyboard doesn't get corrected: it gets mutated into something hilariously unrelated to what you intended to type. Meanwhile, it also doesn't bother trying to come up with any kind of confidence rating for words I type that it doesn't understand. As an example: if I sit there and type a word with one finger, carefully moving my hand slowly to each key and carefully lining up each press, when I hit space bar the iPhone should realize ""there is no way in hell I should be correcting this right now: this was a careful and deliberate action on behalf of this user"", and yet even when you do that it will take a word and butcher it into one of the words in its dictionary; which, in the case of the iPhone, includes such words as ""it's"" and excludes such words as ""its""... it doesn't even have the common decency to run a grammar check, something Word has had a reasonable-if-not-perfect implementation of for well over a decade now.

All you have to do is to construct an intelligent non-quantum computer and ask it ""Hey, are you conscious?"" Of course this doesn't really help you, because what if the computer just <i>thinks</i> it's conscious but doesn't have <i>real</i> consciousness the way we do? What would this even mean? What is it like to be an intelligent but non-conscious mind?

3929191,comment,3926938,3926938,1,0,molesy,,,"Lots of great responses here but I wanted to add mine since this is something all of us non-degree'ers reflect on a lot. There's the first insight - it comes up a lot over the years.<p>I didn't exactly drop out but I got a summer job between high school and my first semester and by the first day of classes I'd agreed to move across the country with the company that'd hired me. That was about fifteen years ago. I've accumulated a few college credits here and there since then and even took a full course load of (online, community college) classes for a semester, definitely nowhere near a degree though.<p>I've been everything from a low-level developer to an upper middle manager (as well as a co-founder) at small startups, mid-range enterprises and one Fortune 50 and what I've figured out at this point is that my lack of a degree can and will hold me back at times, but it frames my experience and motivations in ways that help me explain and even justify who I am in the world. (Nobody special - but it's my choice!)<p>The biggest negative impact, as many people have mentioned here, is the HR/Bschool-driven hiring process that virtually any established company has. Your resume will be algorithmically removed from generic candidate-pool searches. Your salary range will be capped lower than other people's. You may be offered a position, you may even work at a position for a goodly amount of time, and at some point your lack of ""credentials"" may cost you salary or even your position, either by way of an acquirer opting not to hire you on, or your position being eliminated and the only remaining positions requiring credentials you do not have.<p>So you're working harder to find jobs, getting paid less once you find them, you have no alumni network to milk, and if you know how to market these facts (to yourself as well as others) you've got a pretty good story about your dedication to your career, or your family, or whatever it was and is that keeps you from pursuing a degree. That's how I comfort myself at least.<p>My story is a pretty easy sell generally as far as interview discussions go - I ran a consulting company in high school that was by no means wildly successful but kept me busy when I wanted to be, the startup I took that summer job with seemed like a fun laid back place to get a little more experience before school started, and things just naturally took off for the company... that eventually was acquired, its acquirer went bankrupt, got bought a few more times, and its husk is still around somewhere. I was one of the first people laid off when the bankruptcy was announced. I was one of the youngest employees, I didn't contribute as much as my (slightly) older, (slightly) more experienced, (slightly) more tenured teammates. It was a good decision, whether that's what lead to it or not - both for me and for the company. The people I worked with there are amazing, they've gone on to do amazing things since then, and not a day goes by I'm not grateful for having gotten to work with them. Mad props to jeffiel, thuddwhir, beans and that whole crew for being my ""college"" experience.<p>The good news? I feel that way about every single team I've worked with since then. I've worked with amazing people, all of whom I chose to work for because I liked them and what they were doing, not because I felt like I needed the job or that it was the right career move. At some level they all took a chance on me no matter whether I came to them as an a bright-eyed kid or a battle-hardened street fighter. I'm always conscious of that, and I feel it serves me well in making the kind of connections that suit me personally.<p>The really good news though? No matter what you tell yourself it's never too late to go back and get a degree.

You could submit a transfer request and the publisher could re-encode the book to the new owner or format. Would you expect that as the purchaser of the book, you'd be allowed to photocopy it and distribute the photocopy?<p>""DRM Locks Readers In To Platforms"": This is not necessarily the case. The publisher could easily offer the same book in multiple formats. Converting from source is a trivial technical task.<p>""DRM Adds Unneeded Complexity"": DRM does add complexity, but as most people read via an application rather than a text file, this can be abstracted for almost all readers. Again, this is a problem with the implementation.<p>""DRM Stifles Innovation"": Authors not getting paid so that they can eat also stifles innovation. There needs to be a balance here, it's not all about making everyone's work free.<p>""DRM Halts The Spread Of Ideas"": If someone can't afford the book, in many countries they can go to a library. They don't need ownership to read the ideas.<p>In summary, the issue with DRM for books is the implementation. Many of the problems listed are real but could be almost completely negated by the publishers doing things that cost them almost nothing, even following the assumption that everyone wants to read their books for free.<p>To be clear, I'm not implying that I support DRM or that it really does significantly reduce the availability of books that have not be paid for, just that the arguments presented here are against the current implementation rather than DRM itself.",1336149173

After researching it a bit more, I realized I would have been really ticked if I had actually gone. The conference was not expensive at all, but going to it would have meant a flight and hotel, as well as valuable time away from our startup. Looking at the info, I discovered two important things:<p>1. They still have not announced the topics, just the speakers, which makes me think that the talks will be ill-prepared at best. A good presentation takes time to hone.<p>2. They claim that the conference is two days, but in reality, the second day will occur at a different location still TBD (probably not near the first day's venue), and is just an open Barcamp for the attendees. Don't get me wrong, I love a good Barcamp. I've spoken at ours several times. The thing is, a good Barcamp is free. Like Amber, I am from Nashville. We can put on a good one and it doesn't cost attendees a lick. Maybe it's just our volunteer spirit, being the Volunteer state and all.<p>I am still interested in the conference, but the time away from our startup, the cost of the flight and hotel, and the concerns I listed above make me want to avoid it like the plague.",1336148775

The thing is, you have to learn and understand it before making assumptions based on ""hello world""-like pieces of code. The best ""feature"" I found so far is not even a feature. It is the way the language is designed simultaneously with the framework/os. It feels more compact and makes reasoning about programs easier.<p>The second is the way in which complex applications are built. Some programming languages are known for having many design patterns around them, which often feel artificial.

Anyone who has real world experience has demonstrated far more ability than a degree shows.  At best a degree shows some potential theoretical knowledge that someone who didn't go to school might lack.<p>But you started a business that did ok?  That is two orders of magnitude more difficult and compelling than an undergraduate degree.<p>>But you need a truly remarkable accomplishment to reach that state.<p>No you don't.  The reality is this- once you have a couple years experience on your resume, all any employer (worth a damn) cares about is that experience.  Because they know college is really irrelevant to your performance as an employee.  You spend 2 years writing Rails Apps and you're applying for a rails position, they're going to talk to you about rails apps, not which frat you pledged.  IF you're applying for a C++ position, then they're going to want to know about your C++ knowledge, and that rails app experience shows professional work at a place that kept you around.  Those 2 years of work experience (what you could have by the time your friends are sophomores) is far more valuable than 4 years of college, to a prospective employer.<p>>HR departments when they are deciding whether or not you meet the base requirements of the position, or what pay you should receive.<p>Dealt with many of these over decades, was never an issue.  In fact, since most of the jobs I applied to in my career involved sending my resume to recruiters or HR departments and others clueless about engineering, you'd think that there being no degree on my resume would have been a factor.  But it never was.  I always- from the early 1990s to the late 2000s when I stopped deigning to work for others-- had far more interest than I could even interview at. They don't even notice you don't have a degree if you've got a couple years of experience.  Maybe at government they have rules that require a degree to get a raise but you don't want to work for incompetent organizations like that anyway.<p>This is the reality: Screeners DON'T EVEN NOTICE YOU DON'T HAVE A DEGREE. You could call them up and say ""does one need a college degree for this job?"" and they'd naturally say ""yes"" because they wasted 4 years and 4 tones of money getting one.  I always sent my resumes to jobs without regard to whether they required a degree or not.  They didn't care.  They just put that degree requirement there to screen out the people with no experience.  Many times now they put ""or equivalent experience.""<p>The market reality is this-- four years of employment experience is more valuable than a 4 year degree.<p>>Supervisors and middle/upper management as they consider which employees are likely retention/flight risks<p>This is silly.  This is just a prejudice.  Hey your first year out of college I had 3 years of employment, obviously showing more time on a job than you had, so obviously less of a ""flight risk"". Plus if you did think someone might leave, that wouldn't be a reason to not give them a raise, that would be a reason to INCENTIVIZE them to stay!<p>>I've seen really good and smart and (largely) productive people get shafted over the long haul... These issues come up for at least the first 15-20 years of one's career, in my experience.<p>If you do happen to be at a stupid company that discriminates against employees in this fashion, rather than promotes based on performance and ability, then it is fairly easy to get a much better salary by switching to another company.  And this is only a factor the first couple years out anyway.<p>>Having a degree, if nothing else, demonstrates a certain amount of ""stick-to-itiveness"".<p>No, it demonstrates conventional thinking. Four years of actual work experience demonstrates the same commitment, but also far more professionalism and useful training than a degree.<p>>I'd guess that most people forced to make a a hiring or investment decision would at least pause to consider why candidate dwong didn't complete a degree program.<p>You'd guess wrong. They care more about what you've done in the real world.  Work experience is far more compelling than the college bubble.<p>>There is also value in the college experience and liberal arts education<p>Its a negative value in my experience.  College graduates seem to be more likely to believe without thinking about things, to be unable to accept evidence to the contrary and to be more susceptible to ideology.   Its like they are taught to reject science.",1336148453

But I have to agree with a lot of other posters that this just seems like a case of people being too lazy to learn something new. If we were talking about the old Obj-C without blocks, ARC and collection literals, I might be more sympathetic. But this just doesn't seem like enough of an improvement to throw out static typing, a decent visual debugger, and first-class, unmediated access to the native APIs without a clumsy pseudo-selector syntax.<p>It's true that Xcode is bad, but the solution to that is to use AppCode, not to throw out the language.",1336147555

This actually works as a filter- those who think for themselves will not fall for this and will end up leading companies and being very successful.  Those who are highly influenced and controlled by the opinions of others, however, will worry about this, and will go to college because its the ""right thing to do"" and will live long careers at safe companies getting their annual bump, thinking they're doing a lot better than those irresponsible people who dropped out.  They'll spend their lives sucking down the daily humiliation of dealing with an idiot boss, because once you've got 5, 10 years with a company, why throw away your pension over working for an idiot?  They'll be people who work for others.<p>So the real question is-- are you someone who is going to make something of yourself?  Or are you going to want the safety of working for other people, where the outcome of your life was determined by someone else?<p>Sure its scary.  Notice all the FUD being put forward here.  I can tell you the reality s this-- a few years of work experience and nobody cares whether you went to college or not.  Employers know that college is not the same as experience and is far less valuable.<p>IF you listen to others, they are always going to advise the mainstream ""safe"" route.  This is why they don't achieve real success in life.<p>I've seen this often:<p>-- The mainstream choice is college, but you lose 4 years of career experience and instead of making money you spend it.  The financial outcome is negative, but most people do it anyway.<p>-- Most people put their money in index funds or mutual funds and make mediocre returns because they believe they can't beat the market (but spend $50 on books) and 5 hours a year on it, and you can far beat the market. (The idea that it is even hard is silly-- but most people are convinced of it and so they tell other people that they can't' do it, or point to studies that show that, in aggregate, the result of people investing in the market is market returns (minus commissions) which conclude that they underperform the market.  Well, of course, you're taking the actual market (the people in aggregate) comparing it to the market and then subtracting commissions, how can that not underperform?)<p>-- They buy houses in a bubble and then blame the banks when their mortgage is underwater. (I knew there would be a bubble in 2001, because of an article on mises.org ... because of economics.)  ""But you never lose money buying a house"".<p>-- They live their lives in their house, limiting themselves to employers within a reasonable commute...when they could be traveling the world, and visiting a dozen countries a year.  I'm doing that, and running a startup and our cost of living is less than the average household income in the USA.  Yet for american to travel they think they have to run up a credit card debt that takes them a decade to pay off.<p>This is the real question- are you going to make something of yourself, or are you going to accept what life gives you if you just doing what everyone else does?<p>Would you rather be a self made failure than a coasting weak ""success""?",1336147541

General relativity, when applied to everyday human experience (i.e. not super fast, super big, super heavy), produces Newton's law of gravity.<p>Personally I think the next step in scientific understanding is in information theory. It has the possibility of unifying chaos theory, computer science, physics, and biology. I think this is how we'll develop an description of consciousness for example.

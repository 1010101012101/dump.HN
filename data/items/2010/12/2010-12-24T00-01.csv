One of the biggest problems from the merchant's perspective is being able to be successful with these tools and actually benefitting in the long run. They need a way to be able to test these deals to see how they are working for their business and then measure if these deals are driving traffic and revenue and continually tweak them. For services based businesses, being able to fill last minute availabilities instead of selling vouchers that can be used at anytime are also extremely critical to sustainability. Without this, this advertising method won't be able to serve these local businesses. These are the very things we are focusing on at bTreated.<p>Thanks for the great food for thought!<p>Andrew Hersch

But just like medicine that sometimes doesn't work, or isn't administered properly, the solution is not to stop using the medicine, but to correct the mistakes made when delivering it.<p>Consider this: When you use a stunner properly, the animal feels a split second of pain before becoming unconscious. At this point, pretty much every vet would say it can't feel pain.<p>But if you cut its throat while conscious, it can feel the pain of the wound immediately, and continues to feel it until the brain starts shutting down. This can take <i>minutes</i>. Cutting the throat does not cause immediate unconsciousness, and this is the problem.<p>Compare a properly stunned animal vs. an animal whose throat has been cut by via sechita, and tell me which one reaches unconsciousness faster.

When you use map to do your mapping, aren't you are stating your intent in the language of the profession?

So, the idea of calling a map a map has some precedent that we can use to justify the practice, doesn't it?<p>Now, if your audience has no notion of what a mapping is, then, yes, there's a level of semantic intent that you're not going to be able to communicate to them.

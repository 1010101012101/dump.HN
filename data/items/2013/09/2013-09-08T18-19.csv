Math is a non-standard non-machine-executable programming language which means it&#x27;s inherently buggy. On top of that, now I need to interpret the &quot;code&quot; while I&#x27;m learning and it can be pretty dense.<p>Much like in programming, I&#x27;m sure expert mathematicians may not see why it&#x27;s so painful, but wait until a more robust language/system is developed for the hobbyist.

It&#x27;s thus thought to be easy to produce a naive GCM implementation that will suffer from side channel attacks. That concern is rapidly being mitigated by newer CPUs which can do the multiplications for GCM in hardware.<p>From a theoretical perspective, the polynomial MACs (like GHASH) are very well understood.<p>But, much more importantly, the TLS GCM construction is the only modern stream encryption standardized and widely available to TLS. The block constructions in TLS suffer from being created before Encrypt-then-MAC was proven secure; they do the operations the other way around, and thus require extremely fiddly code to quash side channels that have (unlike GCM) already been shown to admit plausible attacks.<p>The author of this proposal probably isn&#x27;t so much making a statement about GCM so much as he is suggesting that we need to deprecate the 90&#x27;s-crypto parts of TLS, which is something that is hard to argue with.",1378665714

Note that you have control over who&#x27;s seeing the crowdfunder (e.g. the people in your email list or social circle), so you are also determining the difficulty of the sale itself by choosing the market and the initial crowdfunding audience.

And if you can do that then how are you supposed to know what specific subset of the things you did are the ones you aren&#x27;t supposed to do again? So there was the argument in the Swartz case that, for example, getting kicked off for downloading too quickly just means they want you to slow down rather than stop because they don&#x27;t want you to degrade performance for others.

That seems extremely problematic because the judge is doing the clarification on what the law means ex post facto but then still subjecting the defendant&#x27;s prior conduct to that new ruling, but that&#x27;s the situation the statute leaves courts in unless they&#x27;re willing to throw it out as a result of that.",1378665602

Laws create social norms. When it comes to private property, the laws create a social norm wherein you&#x27;re expected to give peoples&#x27; private property a very wide berth except according to certain clearly-defined, socially-accepted conventions. I.e. you can come onto someone&#x27;s property if you&#x27;re invited, or if the property seems to be a public venue and you have no reason to think you&#x27;re banned, but generally you stay the fuck away. The end result of that norm is that people don&#x27;t go and buy the best possible locks. The social norm enforces the owner&#x27;s right to exclude, not technology. I don&#x27;t even lock the door to my apartment because I know that nobody is going to come into my apartment and just look around because they found the door unlocked.

It&#x27;s the lingua franca when talking about CS and you will need it to understand ADC for example. It introduces set theory, graph theory and so forth, which are used in ADC/AI etc... to describe and solve problems.<p>- Linear Algebra: if you ever want to work with 3d stuff, this one will be essential. It&#x27;ll also work out nicely for 2d work, and seeing as you mentioned you&#x27;ve got a knack for UI work, you probably will appreciate this one. It&#x27;ll allow you to get an understanding of for example affine transformations etc... You will need a computer graphics course too, but this is definitely a prerequisite course to do those.<p>- Probability and statistics. I really hated this course (it&#x27;s also one of the harder ones coincidentally), but once you &quot;get it&quot;, you really do &quot;get it&quot;. Ever wondered how gesture recognition works? Or how spam filters work? Well, the math required for this will be addressed here, together with the following subject.<p>- Artificial Intelligence. Extremely useful if you&#x27;re interested in game dev, or just want to learn to solve problems in a smart and efficient manner. It combines ADC with discrete mathematics with probability & statistics.<p>- Calculus. If not for the math, it&#x27;ll definitely make you look at things in a different way, which imo in turn, contributes to your way of looking at problems. Partial derivation / integrals and how it can relate to 3d surfaces for example. And let&#x27;s not forget taylor series etc... It&#x27;ll give you an idea of how mathematical functions such as sin(1) etc... can be implemented etc...<p>- Operating systems, Computer Architecture/organization. Essential for understanding what happens under the hood. Allows you to reason about what the best code path is for solving a problem. Should you use the GPU for example instead of the CPU etc... and if so, why? etc... It also introduces models such as finite state automatons etc... which are also applicable in language processing for, say, compilers.<p>And that brings us to the last, but certainly not least subject, my all time favorite:
- Compiler construction. Gives you an insight in how languages are being processed, and how to design your own language and build a compiler for it. It should also give you additional insights on how runtimes/virtual machines work.<p>The software engineering courses were more about processes, philosophies and patterns etc... and even though they&#x27;re definitely useful, I think most experienced software engineers have already &quot;got this&quot;.

The clear interpretation is clearly wrong and the remaining interpretation has undefined behavior because of the lack of any obvious demarcation point for authorized access.<p>In addition to that, we have the &quot;ignorance of the law&quot; issue. If you don&#x27;t know what &quot;unauthorized access&quot; means but you intentionally do something that a judge subsequently decides was unauthorized access, are you (or the hypothetical security researcher, for example) going to be willing to bet your freedom that the fact that you subjectively didn&#x27;t intend for your access to be unauthorized is going to keep you out of prison?

6349554,comment,6348150,6348697,1,0,thetylerhayes,,,"Agreed.<p>What this means is that usually in the medical world you can&#x27;t just build a product or service and sell it to EHR/EMR providers. Their (e.g., Epic, eClinicalWeb) customer is hospitals and clinics. So you need to get hospitals and clinics to demand/buy what you offer. Only then EMRs will pay attention and only because increasing amounts of their customers are knocking down their door asking for your product.<p>Very rare is the case where an EMR will see the market opportunity you&#x27;re carving out and buy your product. They don&#x27;t care. They&#x27;ll either buy your company once you get big enough to represent a sizable addition to their revenue (single millions is not even close) or just build an imitation feature once they&#x27;re forced to.",1378663304

For example, some securities laws are strict liability. The punishment is disgorgement of profits, but imprisonment is not on the table.<p><i>Most citizens are comforted by the notion, that no matter the unfairness in the initial process, eventually they will be able to present their case to a jury of their peers. However, even juries are no longer a right in most trials. Since the federal constitution&#x27;s jury trial requirement was never incorporated against the states, most local magistrates are given the power to sentence defendants for up to six months in jail per count. Because most defendants face multiple charges stemming from the same conduct, there are countless American citizens spending years in jail, never having had their case heard by a jury.</i><p>This is factually false.  The right to a trial by jury has been imposed upon the states by way of the 14th Amendment for more than <i>100 years</i>.

When people learned about PRISM and cooperation of companies like Facebook and Google, they could choose to take their business elsewhere. With Lavabit, they could make an attempt at moving their data to legal jurisdictions beyond the reach of the United States government and its allies. However, with this new information, we now have learned that the very foundation of security in most of our software and hardware has been or may have already been compromised.

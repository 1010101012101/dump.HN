There was some article (can&#x27;t remember the source) about generating a random coin flip - the way to tell the difference between a real physical coin flip and a computer is that the real physical flip will have a lot of runs, like 10 times in a row where you get heads. A computer random will attempt to &quot;even out&quot; the spectrum. The two images presented in the article looked similar to these but were reversed, true random looked more like a pattern, while computer generated random looked more like even noise.<p>TL;DR long strings of repeated results are a sign of true randomness.

Just a few examples: (a) if an officer conducts a lawful traffic stop, and smells marijuana (plain-view/plain-smell doctrine) the officer can lawfully search your person and the vehicle,seizing any evidence of a crime, even if unrelated to marijuana; or (b) subsequent to a DUI arrest, an officer can impound the vehicle and conduct a search/inventory of the vehicle and seize any evidence of a crime (even unrelated to the DUI).  These are some of the many lawful Government searches and seizures without prior judicial approval.<p>>At least in America, a judge cannot issue a warrant for the wiretaps you described on the mere accusation that &quot;so and so is a {pedophile,terrorist,drug dealer}.&quot;<p>A judge certainly can issue a warrant based on accusation as long as the judge makes a finding there is probable cause.

It just made more sense. \nI for one see no value in Python3 (unicode has been supported since 2.6). My reasons for migrating to PyPy4 instead of Python3-<p>1) It was easier than porting to CP3.<p>2) It gave me a tangible benefit by removing all CPU performance worries once and for all. Added &quot;performance&quot; as a feature for Python. Worth the testing involved.<p>3) It removed the GIL. If you use PyPy4 STM, which is currently a separate JIT. Which will be at some point merged back into PyPy4.<p>So for me, Python3 can&#x27;t possibly compete, and likely never will with PyPy4 once you consider the performance and existing code that runs with it. PyPy3 is old, beta, not production-ready, based on 3.2 and Py3 is moving so fast I don&#x27;t think PyPy3 would be able to keep up if they tried.<p>Python3 is dead to me. There&#x27;s not enough value for a new language. I&#x27;m not worried about library support because Py2 is still bigger than 3 and 2.7 will be supported by 3rd party libraries for a very long time else choose irrelevance (Python3 was released in 2008, and still struggling to justify its existence...). My views on the language changes themselves are stated much better by Mark Lutz[0]. I&#x27;m more likely to leave Python entirely for a new platform than I am to migrate to Python3.<p>PyPy is the future of Python. If the PyPy team announces within the next 5 years they&#x27;re taking the mantle of Python2, that would be the nail in the coffin. All they have to do is sit back and backport whatever features the Python2/PyPy4 community wants into PyPy4 from CPython3 as those guys run off with their experiments bloating their language. I believe it&#x27;s all desperation, throwing any feature against the wall. Yet doing irreparable harm bloating the language, making the famous &quot;beginner friendly&quot; language the exact opposite.<p>I already consider myself a PyPy4 programmer, so I hope they make it an official language to match the implementation. There&#x27;s also Pyston to keep an eye on which is also effectively 2.x only at this time.<p>[0]<a href=""http://learning-python.com/books/python-changes-2014-plus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learning-python.com/books/python-changes-2014-plus.ht...</a>",1450374950

I&#x27;ve seen the same argument over and over again, and every argument had the same hole that I see in your post: What, <i>exactly</i>, is a &quot;character&quot;?  Please answer me that, and then you can write a proposal for how the API should work, <i>exactly</i>, and why this works with Indic and German and Korean and everything else.<p>Strings have to be arrays.  It is inevitable.  We are on Von Neumann machines with L1 cache lines that are something like 64 bytes wide, so making strings into something other than arrays is a complete non-starter.  Because strings are arrays, we use array indexes to slice strings.  The indexes are integers, because that just makes sense on a Von Neumann machine.<p>So your complaint is that you can slice a string in &quot;bad&quot; ways.  What makes it bad?  You&#x27;re trying to prevent people from slicing up grapheme clusters, which is a noble goal.  But in practice, we get the indexes from methods like str.find() or re.match(), and we treat them as more or less opaque, so we don&#x27;t end up slicing grapheme clusters very often in practice.  Grapheme cluster slicing requires a big Unicode table in memory anyway, so in the rare case that you need it, you can pay the high performance cost for using it.  In the meantime, formats like JSON and XML are defined in terms of code points, so using code point arrays eliminates a class of bugs where you could accidentally make malformed XML or JSON, which would then get completely REJECTED by the receiving side, causing your Jabber client to quit or your web browser to show a bunch of mojibake.<p>And let me ask you this: what do I get when I write:<p><pre><code>    x = &quot;a&quot;\n    y = &quot;\u0301&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIs the resulting len(x + y) == 1?  But len(x) == 1 and len(y) == 1?  Can you tell me what the correct behavior is?  Might you end up with bugs in programs because len(x + y) != len(x) + len(y)?  Or do you introduce extra code points into the string when you concatenate them?<p>Please, tell me what you actually think is correct behavior.  It is far, far more useful than pointing out that something is &quot;wrong&quot; on purely semantic arguments.",1450374426

The private sector consists of many organisations, while in the public sector there&#x27;s basically a single employer and the employees NEED to unionise to bring about a balance with the powers of the employer.<p>Put it another way: imagine someone saying &quot;I can&#x27;t see any net good for voters when public employees aren&#x27;t indentured slaves&quot;. Sure, the voters would get better value from public servants who didn&#x27;t get paid and could be whipped into working faster, but that&#x27;s not how we want to run society.<p>It can be incredibly frustrating to see unions fighting against progress and protecting their own against reasonable discipline. I&#x27;m not some union advocate (I&#x27;m a non-unionised private sector worker) - it would be great if members could take a more temperate line and bring their unions to a more reasonable position. But what the unions ARE isn&#x27;t necessarily about bringing about ideal outcomes, it&#x27;s about sheer exercise of power to fight the corner of their members.<p>The argument in favour of their existence is that it wouldn&#x27;t be reasonable to prevent them, risking exposing their members to exploiting by power in the opposite direction.",1450374416

It&#x27;s about what causes violence, where does it occur, and how can we stop it. The most dramatic form of this crime, occurs most often from guns - so, we need to reframe it from gun violence to violence where guns are involved. This is a 65 year old problem - the root of it, is based on the highway system in conjunction with relining that left poverty in the inner city. I note here, I am leaving out race, but it disproportionately affects (use right?) the African American population because of the redlining (why I mentioned it), thanks to racism and white privilege - debate all you want, but mobility of the white middle class demographic was huge at this time. Think baby-boomers in particular. The SOLUTION to solving a WHOLE slew of problems, which liberals ALWAYS talk about is giving social programs a go on a major scale to help disadvantaged population. Bipartisan politics always shift away from this, because of the polarizing problem of being perceived as to liberal or to conservative, etc. etc. Poverty to expand on violence is exponential and often (like 80% of the problem) involves desperation which leads to crime, disassociation with society and drives youth / people to gang membership. It&#x27;s been a long deep understood problem, that gangs of any time typically lean towards drugs, alcohol, and illegal activities to maintain the syndication of crime. This includes prostitution, which affects women and can more often lead to domestic violence. So, with all _that_ said, think of guns in the mix - illegal and not, and ALLLL the gun programs in the past, where do most of the illegal guns come from - that&#x27;s right, poverty stricken areas. So, I lean back to what is gun control&#x27;s main problem? It&#x27;s ineffective. Solve poverty ... put a CONSERVATIVE BUSINESS BASED DEMOGRAPHIC (namely young moderate Republicans) on every other street with strict oversight who are NOT prejudice to start engines of economic growth to stamp out poverty in areas where it exists. Let Liberals cry all they want, but spearhead poverty in the urban centers and you will reduce violence where guns are involved. THAT is the solution.",1450373546

10752742,comment,10746533,10746533,0,0,bad_user,,,"Core.async is not a substitute for Rx.<p>As a disclaimer I&#x27;m the author of an Rx-inspired library for Scala [1] and that also works for Scala.js in the browser. Shameless plug aside, Scala also has Future/Promise in its standard library and now due to macros support it got scala/async [2], a library that gives you the &quot;await&quot; keyword in Scala, so in Scala you also get this kind of M:N multithreading that looks like synchronous code. This in addition to Akka and other possibilities.<p>In other words I&#x27;ve worked with both approaches and Core.async is not comparable with Rx. I do understand the author&#x27;s woes, as sometimes the Rx model is misapplied, plus it&#x27;s hard to understand for the unfamiliar.<p>One of my colleagues was complaining once that &quot;<i>but I don&#x27;t know what the debounce operator does and it&#x27;s hard for me to read that</i>&quot;. And I told him: <i>yeah dude, but try implementing the logic in debounce by yourself and see how readable that is</i>.<p>And that&#x27;s exactly why Rx is problematic. On one hand because stream processing is fundamentally hard, no matter what model you choose. And on the other hand Rx comes with a lot of useful operators that do a lot for you, but then you have to learn about them.<p>For the naysayers, I&#x27;ll just leave this piece of code with a challenge for implementing it with core.async and compare in terms of readability and note this is a copy paste from actual production code ...<p><pre><code>    commands\n      .groupBy(w => (w.assetID, w.commandID))\n      .mergeMap { gr =>\n        gr.timeout(30.seconds, Observable.empty)\n          .throttleLast(1.second)\n          .distinctUntilChanged\n          .echoRepeated(5.seconds)\n          .whileBusyBuffer(DropOld(30))\n      }\n</code></pre>\nWhat it does is to split the signals for each asset and command, for each of these it&#x27;s supposed to sample the signal by 1 second, but in case the same value is repeated over and over again or in case the channel goes silent, then the last value will end up signaled every 5 seconds (reducing the traffic to our OpenTSDB). Finally for each key we close the stream after 30 seconds of inactivity. And then for each such key it does buffering of at most 30 elements and in case the consumers are too slow, then these buffers start dropping older elements on overflow. And then we merge everything back.<p>I would also show you how we are modeling state machines with the &quot;scan&quot; operator, state machines that are evolved from signals coming from multiple sources, but the sample would be too long. In any case &quot;scan&quot; allows you to use pure functions and data-structures, so you can test your business logic without interactions to third party services, mocks, stubs or whatever.<p>I have to deal with such code all the time. And I&#x27;ve seen such code implemented in a classic fashion as well. You basically end up with Maps storing stuff and with ifs and whiles and with manual timers in an unholy dance of mutation so hard to understand and debug that it would make grown men cry.<p>But then such solutions are not silver bullets. Rx, CSP, futures, actors are not silver bullets to be applied everywhere, with all of them having a sweet spot for which they excel. I&#x27;m actually using Rx, actors, futures, scala/sync in the same project and it&#x27;s great.<p>Also, one last note: Rx is not FRP ;-)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/alexandru/monifu/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alexandru/monifu/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/scala/async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scala/async</a>",1450372741

They do so in part because it&#x27;s trifling and in part because there&#x27;s so much of it and so few of them.<p>To put it another way, the amounts involved are rounding error and the article doesn&#x27;t list any serious effects of the charged misdeeds. Instead it&#x27;s all about comeuppance for something that was legal. The outrage is over raising the price by a bit player.

236870,comment,236808,236867,0,0,robg,,,"I find your first definition overly limiting. And your second too broad. Religious faith, for me, sits somewhere in-between.<p>As for practical applications, I find that particular versions of faith apply to its focus. The scientific faith I share with you but I don't expect an infinite march forward. Just because a question can be addressed with data doesn't mean the answer lies somewhere in there (see brain imaging and consciousness).<p>Religious faith for me simply means a faith that I can better the life I'm living and make a positive impact on this world and its people. But I know I'll fail in many important ways. Some would call that ""sin"" and I was raised Jewish.<p>I have technological faith that Apple will soon produce an iPhone I have to have. But Google's search won't always find what you need to know. And I don't think technology can solve all of our problems.",1215258098

236867,comment,236808,236843,0,0,ajkirwin,,,"There are, of course, two definitions of the word 'Faith'. There is faith as in the biblical context, putting stock and basing your life upon a collected series of written works.<p>Or there is faith, related to a broader range of hopes and beliefs. For instance, I have faith in the resilience of our sciences. I have belief that Einstein was right and that, when we reach a fundamental understanding of the most basic forces of the universe, that general relativity will still hold sway.<p>But, on a more relevant note, I find Theology absolutely fascinating. Collectively, the vast majority of the planet on which we reside believe in something which is untestable, unknowable and incomprehensible.<p>They ascribe attribute and act in mannerisms of which, if directed at other areas of focus, are called dementia, yet somehow, when used with heavily weighted terms such as 'God', become somehow acceptable.<p>Anyway, that's all I will say on the matter, before pg gets on my case about being vastly and shockingly off-topic for here :]",1215257462

236865,comment,236808,236808,0,0,petercooper,,,"Simple. Geeks respect and understand the scientific method. Anything that cannot be observed and tested is considered speculation and not fact.<p>Being an atheist in no mean requires that you remain an atheist forever. Scientists have believed, at many times, in things that we now know are not strictly correct. Once evidence arrives and experiments are performed, scientific consensus changes.",1215256689
236864,comment,236808,236857,0,0,robg,,,"And <i>who</i> stands outside time and space to define the tautology? Dawkins is substituting one definition for all definitions. Problem is, his definition is neither necessary nor sufficient. Furthermore, the traditional problem with organized religion is the same: specific, and sometimes powerful, people failing to see that outcome with their own definitions.<p>Sure, ""God"" could be whatever you want it to be. But that's exactly the point. It's a personal relationship (or lack thereof) defined by you. And no amount of science can take that away. If anything, the failures of modern physics (and soon neuroscience too) deepens my appreciation for the religious perspective.",1215256452

For internal support you often need to decrypt names, address, email but you don't want that same algorithm for passwords, credit cards, etc.",1215256371

My versions are all bought and paid for but, through software bugs @ MSFT, they get treated sometimes as pirated. When you make me upset, I wish the whole Genuine Advantage thing would go away because it's so invasive and buggy - maybe this will be a means to that end.",1215256139

My first thought when I click through your site is, ""Why would I use this over YouTube?"" You have a lot of competitors in the ""Anyone can create/share training videos"" space so I guess I would need to see something unique before it piqued my interest.<p>I guess what I don't see is, ""What are you doing that makes you different?"" Allowing anyone to upload/create training is not new.",1215255809

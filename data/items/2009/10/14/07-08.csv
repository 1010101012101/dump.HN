880903,comment,880819,880819,0,0,patio11,,,"That brings back memories of my days in Boy Scouts.  Getting out in the outdoors is a wonderful character building exercise and presents opportunities that you won't get so much in city living.  And yes, it can be breathtaking beautiful and serene.<p>That being said, I'm keenly aware that it is a fun diversion for rich people.  (The Congressman is probably a good deal wealthier than my family growing up, but either of us are quite rich in comparison to the typical inhabitant of the Marshall Islands.)<p>Nature can be breathtakingly beautiful and awe inspiring.    It can also be terrible and merciless, every inch the avatar of the old pagan gods, and it has a virtually infinite number of ways to kill you.  The foundation of human civilization that people enjoy temporarily escaping from so much is minimizing the chance of terrible, brutal death dealt out stochatically by an uncaring world.<p>This is why while I enjoy the occasional escape to nature (with sensible precautions taken) I feel no particular urge to venerate it per se.  The folks who live in uncontrolled nature 365 days out of the year -- the global poor -- live in misery, squalor, and constant fear of death from things the rest of us can scarcely comprehend you can die from.  (One well-fed American can survive on plentiful crabs for a week but, then again, he could survive on rainwater for a week.  A child in a village full of barely-making-it folks can succumb to diseases exacerbated by famine if the local subsistence food production is just a bit worse than it typically is -- and they don't have a panic button to summon the Coast Guard.)",1255506120

The MIDI protocol was surprisingly simple to figure out (for simple things like ""button-x was pressed at 25% pressure"" anyway). It had a learning mode where you assign a key by pressing it and an action mode where pressing the assigned keys would trigger functions to be called.<p>I had intended to use it as a shortcut panel to run a shell scripts, but never actually finished it.. might do so sometime soon :-)",1255505643

What this means is that you can now create multiple subdomains for your App Engine app, and have them all served by the same application. Thus, your users can access 'myapp.appspot.com', or 'developer.myapp.appspot.com', or 'news.myapp.appspot.com', with your app deciding how to handle each request. No setup is required to use the wildcard domains - simply configure your app to serve up requests to these subdomains however you wish. You can detect which domain a user requested by looking at the 'Host' header in the incoming request - for example, in Python's webapp framework you can access this with self.request.headers['Host'].""""",1255504702

It seems like you're at just about the maturity stage of the cycle, meaning that growth has slowed and new customers won't be coming as quickly.<p>I'm not sure I can help specifically, but many product life cycle graphs also include an 'innovation' stage, which occurs either at maturity or decline, and essentially restarts the growth stage. (<a href=""http://blog.cestudios.ca/images/innovation-product-life-cyc.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cestudios.ca/images/innovation-product-life-cyc....</a>)<p>If you think that this cycle applies in your situation, then it's time to innovate. I think moving to Europe is a good idea. It's basically the same product to a new branch of customers. Eventually the new geographic segment well will dry up, and you'll have to look at other ways to innovate. What new products does your existing market base want? Do you have a decent grasp of who your typical customers are? Would they be willing to use a subscription-based app (good source of recurring revenue)?<p>Another angle to investigate is sponsorship by certain parks and trails. Would the local parks and rec office be willing to promote community hikes through your website and iPhone app? A great thing you have going for you is location-awareness. You know that users who are searching for trails in a specific area either are or plan to be there sometime soon. As they are searching, future events could show up on the maps. Where is most of your web traffic coming from? You could even promote hiking safety or kids hiking events, depending on your audience.<p>I congratulate you on your success so far - In fact, I envy you. You've found a way to combine two things that you enjoy and turn it in to a business. Keep up the good work. Good luck!",1255504291

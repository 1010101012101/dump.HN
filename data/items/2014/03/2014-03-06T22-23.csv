That relocation package doesn&#x27;t look so hot now, does it?<p>I now follow a few rules before accepting a package like this:<p>1. It must be pro-rata- That means that the amount you need to pay back must go down with time. So if you leave after 1 year of a 2 year notice period, you must only pay back 50%.<p>2. Like you discovered, the company can overpay for services and stick you with the bill. So always insist on paying for relocation yourself, and get money back via a expenses form. You will be short of cash in the short term, but it will save you pain in the long term.<p>3. If possible, try to negotiate a &quot;hiring bonus.&quot; This may not be possible unless you are famous (or needed for a critical project), but if you can get the company to give you some extra cash, you can pay for relocation yourself. This is the best option, as you owe the company nothing.",1394146753

7357104,comment,7356464,7356805,1,0,techsupporter,,,"For San Francisco (the city in the screenshot and the only city that ever seems to matter when getting app-based startups), the rule is that parking at a broken meter is still very much valid.  Same goes for where I live and everywhere I&#x27;ve lived and tried to park in multiple places in the U.S.  I suspect this is half an enforcement problem (doesn&#x27;t look good in the papers, &quot;City Tows People Parked at Busted Meters&quot;) and part not denying use of a parking spot just because the one pay box is busted.  Broken meters are one reason why cities in the U.S. are going to parking time window stickers and fewer pay boxes.<p>As for things like faded curb paint and missing signs and so on, that&#x27;s not an excuse the operator of the vehicle can use.  Even if there&#x27;s no red curb paint here, you&#x27;re still not allowed to park within 30 feet of an intersection (on the direction-of-travel side) or 10 feet of a fireplug or 5 feet of a driveway.  Those are all things you&#x27;re expected to know by virtue of having a driver license.  Now, being ticketed for being over-time on a free parking stretch that&#x27;s limited to 2 hours when the sign has gone missing might be one thing, but the folks around here put up so many signs in so many places, I think a person would have a hard time making that stand up.<p>Ultimately: if someone isn&#x27;t sure and wants to not risk incurring the fine, he or she shouldn&#x27;t leave a hunk of metal and plastic sitting on the public right-of-way.",1394145300

I filled up my motorcycle and pulled out of a gas station. Within maybe 500-600 feet I got pulled over. I had no idea at all why, as I certainly wasn&#x27;t speeding or doing anything even moderately questionable.<p>I got a $100 &#x27;equipment violation&#x27; ticket for having the visor on my helmet opened by 2 inches so I could get some air flow in slow traffic.

Oh, and no eye protection.<p>I simply paid the ticket, as the ticket had stiff language on it saying that if I contested it that they could increase the fines/fees significantly, and frankly I didn&#x27;t have the time to go through NYC bureaucracy.<p>The cop admitted to me that he wouldn&#x27;t have normally pulled me over, but they were doing &#x27;motorcycle enforcement&#x27; (aka. quota) and they had to pull over anyone for anything.",1394145138

Or pay for two taxi rides. Or, if you&#x27;re one of the above mentioned wealthy people, hire a full time driver.<p>On the other hand, there are plenty of instances where people are unfairly penalized for badly signposted regulations, faded paint (especially red in the dark lit by low-pressure sodium), regulations only a local would reasonably know about, or even broken meters.

Regulators have a tendency to &quot;motivate&quot; others to &quot;get used to&quot; things, not the other way around.<p>With E-gold years ago, the proprietors were criminally indicted for activity that took place on their network.<p>With your architecture, if the Feds deemed that their was laundering taking place or the exchange was otherwise being used to facilitate illicit activity, then I can easily envision them expanding the &quot;responsible parties&quot; definition beyond gateway operators to <i>any</i> node in the exchange. This, of course, would mean that anyone participating would be liable for activity that routed through them, thereby having a chilling effect on participating peers. So, if their goal is to shut down the exchange, they can effectively do so via this implicit threat of criminal prosecution.<p>If any of this sounds far-fetched, you really have to review the E-gold case [0] to see just how much the regulatory regime will contort itself to keep financial transactions under its constant watch.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold#Criminal_prosecution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold#Criminal_prosecution</a>",1394144077

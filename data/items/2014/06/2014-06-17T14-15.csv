If you get a new source of input (say from the network) you&#x27;d have to remember to resync everything. To keep it simple you&#x27;d probably have to respond to `something changed` -> `update everything`. Reactive templates would only update the elements dependent on that change.<p>With a reactive solution you make a model that contains observable RGB values and a function to compute the final color.

7904776,comment,7904064,7904561,5,0,pknight,,,"I am also skeptical of this plugin but I think almost all of your points are moot.<p>There is big market for a solution that lets users backup and restore the filesystem and a database on a more granular level. Not being able to easily and conveniently revert changes that are made easily is one of the biggest pain points in managing a WordPress site. If you update WordPress and find that a critical plugin doesn&#x27;t work, there is no convenient way to undo the update. Of course, ideally, these kinds of things are tested on a staging server first, but the truth is only a minority of sites utilize a staging server in this manner.<p>A lot of pain around websites is dealing with changes to the filesytem and database. To have a simple way of tracking changes and reverting changes is a boon. Both normal end-users and developers will jump for joy with a unified tool for this.<p>You can&#x27;t compare this with many of the existing backup solutions either. You get far more detail (which helps with debugging) and far more incremental control when you have something git-like managing it all.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the solution would not be dependent on being accessible from a site&#x27;s WP backend. But then, I don&#x27;t know the specifics yet.<p>I don&#x27;t see the problem raising money through crowdfunding for this either, from their point of view. It&#x27;s a sound business strategy that validates a market and provides some investment.<p>My hesitation is this, we have no idea if they even have the skills to pull something like this off. Because it&#x27;s not going to be easy. The WP environment can really vary from one site to the next (different server setups/different plugins/themes etc) and you have to make it work on them all. That&#x27;s just a huge undertaking. I think you&#x27;d need a pretty big team with a ton of experience and a lot more than 30k to get close to pulling it off.",1403017067

Whenever you&#x27;re selling something you want to make it as easy as possible for the other person to say yes. You want to remove any concerns. Same when pitching a journalist. Don&#x27;t let them figure out why your startup is interesting, but explain it. How is your startup different? How is it remarkable? Whether it&#x27;s the product, team, vision, etc doesn&#x27;t really matter, as long as you&#x27;ve got something interesting to tell that the audience of the journalist will love to read.<p>(Founder of BetaList)",1403016949

It might not <i>look like</i> poo to you, but there&#x27;s also examples of pictograms in the same script: 田 means field and looks like one.<p>Of course these are &quot;official part of a language&quot;. But why? Under whose authority? You could cite &quot;actual usage&quot;, but many of the emoji in Unicode certainly have seen actual usage for 10+ years in East Asia, so they qualify. And many of the letters in Unicode were in fact designed by committee prior to mass adoption by an actual population (for example the Hangul alphabet), so a lot of scripts already in Unicode originally didn&#x27;t meet that barrier.<p>* = Letters vs. characters: Elements of alphabets are referred to as letters. Alphabets are graphical representations of phonemes, but many other writing systems encode syllables (syllabaries, like the Japanese kana), morphemes or words (logographies) instead. Unicode contains examples of all of these, and thus not just letters. So we want to talk about characters instead.",1403016943
7904762,comment,7903461,7903747,5,0,gambiting,,,"I come from a country where 30 years ago every single phone call was listened to by a government worker, and everyone knew,and no one cared. People literally did not care, using the same arguments as you are using - why would they worry about what they are saying to their girlfriends, wives, husbands, so on. And you know what? For most part, the government didn&#x27;t care. But it was gathering notes on everyone - where are you going, when, with whom, are you drinking, are you buying something - everything that could be of importance was recorded,but never acted upon. Unless you managed to piss off someone. Unless you said something bad about the police or a local politician. Then these notes would be found, even from several years before,and they would be used to put you in prison for 20+ years, as a &quot;danger to society&quot;.<p>This is exactly what is happening right now, and you have to be a complete IDIOT to not see that this is the case. Governments are gathering loads of data about every single one of us. Just because they decide not to act on that data right now,does not mean we should not be worried, and you couldn&#x27;t be more wrong when you say that the government does not care what you write to your gf on iMessage.",1403016919

7904708,comment,7901991,7902445,16,0,Aardappel,,,"Hi. I designed most of FlatBuffers, so let me see if I can clarify:<p>Clearly, FlatBuffers seeks a different design tradeoff than Cap&#x27;n Proto. We wanted to retain all the flexibility of Protobufs, while having the advantages of the &quot;zero parsing / zero allocation&quot; approach. That brought us to the vtable design.<p>In use cases where performance matters, i.e. you are churning through a large amount of data, you will be accessing the same vtable repeatedly, and the cost of the extra indirection (and the code associated with it) will be masked by the memory latency of the main data you&#x27;re going through. It will be (close to) &quot;for free&quot;. Even in cases where that isn&#x27;t the case, whether or not it is able to match Cap&#x27;n Proto&#x27;s accessor code is less interesting than it being endlessly faster than Protobuf and most other serializers out there, given that it is just as flexible.<p>vtables are de-duped on the fly during construction. It is typically not expensive.<p>Note this tiny overhead holds for &quot;tables&quot;, we also have naked &quot;structs&quot;, which do not have the indirection overhead, but have no forwards/backwards compatability. Useful for things like 2d/3d vector types, colors, and other small POD types that are used a lot.<p>FlatBuffers also has unions, which you should use instead of optionals when appropriate. We feel optionals have a lot of uses beyond just mere unions and forwards/backwards compatibility, however. Game objects can have a LOT of fields, many of which are often at their default value, and thus not stored on the wire. This gives significant compression. The zero-byte compression in Cap&#x27;n Proto is cool, but we prefer to not have to use additional buffers when reading. Optionals also give a lot of design freedom, i.e. you can add a field that you know is only needed for very few instances without fear of bloating your binaries, as an alternative to &quot;subclassing&quot;, or indeed unions.<p>On field declaration order: to each his own, I guess. That said, the omission of explicit field id&#x27;s is something that&#x27;s handled at the level of the schema compiler, we could easily allow optional id declarations in the schema for people who want the flexibility of declaring things in an arbitrary order. Noted.<p>We should clean up the benchmark code, so it can be included, yes. It is not running a noop loop, we made sure of that. I haven&#x27;t verified what makes Protobuf traversal that much slower, I am guessing it&#x27;s causing a memory allocation somewhere.",1403016472

But I&#x27;m old enough to remember being able to purchase beer in Germany as soon as I was tall enough to look over the bar and get the bartender&#x27;s attention.<p>You are right that alcohol consumption, particularly hard alcohol seemed to have been more common in the 1960s. Overall traffic death rates were very high before the Ralph Nader auto safety revolution, often for stupid reasons. I&#x27;m sure somebody has done a good analysis of the complex reasons why, but my hypothesis is that commonplace drinking has gone down as car safety has gone up, being attributed to traffic deaths by organizations like MADD, etc. It&#x27;s become less socially acceptable to drink during working hours.",1403015889

Based on something once overheard on a bus, nonetheless.<p>The idea that I overheard it on a bus makes it less credible doesn&#x27;t really hold water in my mind.  It was in an informal setting and thus more likely to be true.  And if someone&#x27;s motivation to have another child is to collect more welfare I&#x27;m not so convinced that it&#x27;s an entirely unreasonable assumption that they&#x27;re not going to do the best job raising them.  If this mother couldn&#x27;t think through the thoughts necessary to realize that welfare shouldn&#x27;t be a system that you milk for all it&#x27;s worth and instead is a system designed to help you get back on your feet (at least ostensibly) then I&#x27;m not so confident she&#x27;s going to do a stellar job of everything else.  She might very well teach them through actions if not words, that going on welfare is preferable to real work.  That&#x27;s a potent recipe for dependency.<p>>The fact that there is a tiny percentage abusing the help is a very poor excuse for not giving help to the much, much larger percentage of people who are deeply, genuinely in need of it.<p>That&#x27;s a big fat [citation needed].  Furthermore if you assume that those who are abusing the system know the right things to say when they&#x27;re interviewed or to put down on the forms I can&#x27;t really figure out how you could reasonably determine the percentage of people abusing the system.  Hire a million PIs to follow folks around?

Your typical Western font will focus on Latin with varying coverage of descendants (like the Portuguese and Vietnamese alphabets) and perhaps expand to cover Cyrillic, but not more. Conversely, it&#x27;s rare for a font by a Korean foundry to have equivalent Latin/Cyrillic coverage next to its native Hangul alphabet.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of <i>documents</i> that mix these writing systems, though. I do in fact visit websites that aren&#x27;t covered by any one font in my browser&#x27;s default settings or any one family named in the site&#x27;s markup/CSS all the time, and you probably do too.<p>Hence the font stacks on all relevant platforms perform glyph substitution: If font X doesn&#x27;t contain a glyph, it&#x27;ll go looking for a font Y that does and drop that glyph in.

Many of the stories on publications like TechCrunch are as much about the founders as they are about the startups. Look for an interesting angle related to yours and pitch it accordingly.<p>-Bloggers have to create several stories a week. Do as much of their job for them as you can by framing the outline of the story they will write in your pitch for coverage (related to previous point). If you started it as a side-project while in college, great, mention that. If your startup is in the same space as [hot trendy startup], great, mention that.

And therapy, even self-journaling, is shown to change connectivity patterns in the brain.<p>The problem is simply shown by the vast array of medical professions trained to treat the brain: neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, neuropsychologists, brain surgeons, and neuroscientists. By contrast, cardiologists treat the heart.<p>To put into practical terms, increasing evidence is showing how sleep disorders precede brain health concerns. The role of sleep appears to be critical for trash collection at the cellular level in the brain. Yet, few on the mental health &quot;side&quot; treat sleep problems.

I believe that distinction stems from France, but I&#x27;m familiar with it from Norway, and variations of it is widespread throughout Europe.<p>For example, you typically have a legal right to have your name on a work, regardless of copyright. You also typically have a legal right to have your name removed from the work if alterations are made that affects the integrity of it, or that may be detrimental to the creators reputation (e.g. imagine someone deciding to alter key sentences in your political treatise to make it mean the opposite of your original), again irrespective of copyright.<p>So the protection of a creators moral rights does in Europe explicitly <i>not</i> require a wider interpretation of copyright.",1403014216

7904462,comment,7903495,7904392,4,0,sho_hn,,,"You&#x27;re right, but at the same time the level of abstraction it offers over <i>spoken</i> language is one of the reasons for the historic success of logographic writing. For example, in Chinese history it allowed mutually unintelligible dialects to more easily exchange information in writing, and it isolated orthography from shifts in pronunciation to a greater degree than possible with phonographic scripts. I feel like emoji have some similar properties along these lines, but of course also their own set of problems (specific visualizations can become dated, for example).<p>A fair bunch of Chinese characters are also actually pictographic (they&#x27;re an image of something) or ideographic (they represent an abstract idea, not a morpheme or word) in origin, if not current usage.<p>This stuff - synergies and conflicts between writing systems and various media - fascinates me. Chinese writing for example now suffers from the problem that if your medium doesn&#x27;t allow free-form painting/graphical compositing (like our computers largely don&#x27;t right now) you can&#x27;t easily coin new logograms, since you need a central registry that&#x27;s slow to distribute to leaf nodes (cf. Unicode). So what&#x27;s happening now is that new words get coined by recombining existing characters based on their sound value, adding a phonographic layer on top. And of course inputting Chinese has also become dependent on auxiliary systems like pinyin-based IMEs.<p>Meanwhile, the Korean Hangul alphabet has the interesting property that some of the letters graphically derive from each other with consistent patterns of &quot;take this, add a stroke and you get this&quot;, making it easier to design keyboards with reduced numbers of buttons to enter combos. There&#x27;s the theory that this contributed to the success of texting/mobile in Korea, and is a contributing reason for the healthy mobile industry there.<p>I&#x27;m getting far from the original topic with this rambling, but it still reads on it in one sense: There&#x27;s a lot of variety to writing systems, and it&#x27;s worth thinking about emoji as a spot on the spectrum instead of in isolation.",1403014031

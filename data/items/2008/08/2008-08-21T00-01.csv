There's always something else that needs to be done and it ends up getting scripted away. Even the most basic deployment usually involves a copy and telling the server to restart or refresh itself.",1219280204

Other times when there isn't quite so much on the line it makes sense to keep your workload lower.<p>Our profession is very subject to burnout and requires a <i>lot</i> of education to keep up. Taking time off is valuable for peak cognitive function.<p>That said, DHH may take it too far.

So I use ""heck"", ""durn"", ""shucky-bob"" and any other ridiculously non-profane words I can come up with. Then when I add a ""hell', ""damn"", ""fuck' or the like, it stands out.<p>When I was in my twenties and in the service, every other word was profane. When you use something all the time, it just doesn't work any more. Like a good spice, the trick is the moderate and appropriate application at the right time.<p>I love profanity. It's even more fun now that I squelch it up and down to suit the occasion. It's almost like playing a musical instrument. Now that I rarely use it any more, it's all the more enjoyable.",1219279594

CL are a non-player in our market, but the CL equivalent cannot compete with us in automotive.<p>Why? High quality reference data, the kind that means you can't add a 1999 Ford Pinto CL if no such thing exists, and if it did exist we know it came with an iPod dock, is reasonably expensive to create and maintain and generalist just don't have the focus.<p>High quality reference data leads to high quality search, where you search for 2007 Ford X and get only '07 Ford X' or you search for late model BMW's between $25k and $33k and get exactly those, tends to deliver high quality buyers. Search quality and lead quality are inextricably linked. Sellers tend to follow high quality buyers.<p>I don't know how CL fares vertical for vertical, but I'd be quite surprised if in most markets they were the #1 player in each vertical.",1219279353

Currently it invalidates when any table referenced by the query changes. It seems like you could improve this algorithm without too much trouble. For example, it feels like if the query was located solely through indexes, it should be able to do cache invalidation on an update to those index hits rather than on the entire table.<p>I'll have to look through the code one day and see why this makes no sense.",1219277289

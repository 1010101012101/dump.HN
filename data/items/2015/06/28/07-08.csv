One female, the smartest rat I ever saw, wanted to keep a large piece of bread for herself. The door into the cage had other rats loitering, so she went on a huge detour to the back of the cage, obviously with a theory that there might be a door in the corresponding position there. There wasn&#x27;t, so she went back, picked up the bread where she had stored it, just of sight of the others, and forced her way through the main door. Watching it, we could have no doubt whatsoever this was a thought out, reasoned plan. The route to the back of the cage was long, complex, not obvious, and never before explored.\nOn another occasion, she lied to us for quite a while, and was only caught out one night when I happened to see her at work. The food bowl was down to the least favourite bits, and she was systematically cleaning it out, burying the junkfood under floor litter. The moment the bowl was empty, she started banging and rustling to get our attention, look, the bowl is empty, I&#x27;m starving. I realised she&#x27;d had me fooled for several weeks where I hadn&#x27;t seen any refused leftovers, and had mistakenly believed the battle of stubborn wills to be over.",1435478076

It merely glossed over the more important issues, such as ambiguity about what counts as a a business, as well as the requirement that privacy services disclose their customer&#x27;s identities to anyone who asks.<p>This is bad. Very bad. The NameCheap email probably gave a lot of people the wrong first impression about what ICANN&#x27;s proposal really means.

9792788,comment,9792365,9792365,0,0,dkbrk,,,"There seems to be yet another threat to our collective privacy every month or so. Normally, I sit firmly on the side of an individual&#x27;s right to privacy, but in this case, I think ICANN have a legitimate point even if they&#x27;re being quite heavy handed about it.<p>WHOIS is an extraordinarily valuable protocol with a heritage dating back to the ARPANET days. As an example, for quite a while we&#x27;ve had this ideal of the semantic web we&#x27;re trying to move towards, but in practice each website is its own special snowflake with more concern given to legacy rendering in Internet Explorer than making sure that contact information is easily findable and semantic. But it&#x27;s mostly okay, because if I <i>really</i> need to contact someone there&#x27;s this almost 40-year-old protocol which gives me unfettered access to information such as a technical contact email and an address.<p>Many registrars don&#x27;t seem to pay much attention to the quality of their WHOIS records and most people or businesses probably don&#x27;t give it a second thought or check the records after registering a new domain. But they should; and I applaud ICANN for their efforts to uphold the quality and integrity of WHOIS.<p>That said, the right to freedom of speech implies that one should have the ability to disseminate ideas with complete anonymity. ICANN&#x27;s proposal would completely undermine this, which is unacceptable.<p>I think there is space for a middle ground, where ICANN can ensure that the WHOIS records aren&#x27;t what amounts to a blantant lie in the case of anonymous registrations (i.e the registrar providing their <i>own</i> details as the contact information). The current situation is pretty bad: if I want to contact the owner of such a domain, all I can reasonably expect is for any email sent to be blackholed by the registrar. I&#x27;m not talking about attempting to deanonymise the owner of such a domain, merely the idea that a domain is a named endpoint with an owner who is contactable through freely available means.<p>Imagine if ICANN created a new class of domains where it was made <i>explicit</i> in the WHOIS that the owner wished to remain anonymous, but nonetheless provided accurate information such as a pseudonym and a means of contact without violating their privacy. This means of communication could be some form of email hosted by a trusted third party, or potentially something more esoteric such as a GPG-encrypted message embedded in the bitcoin blockchain.<p>This would preserve the correctness and utility of the WHOIS database while respecting the rights I believe ICANN have a responsibility to uphold.",1435477507

I can definitely squeeze 5 minutes out of 70080 minutes per week to see if there’s any truth in it.<p>PS. Just like U.S. continues to produce brilliant research in technologies and material sciences, India continues to produce brilliant souls for spiritual evolution and liberation of human beings. I consider Om Swami amongst one of such evolved soul. But he’s treaded life more or less like one of us as you’d learn from his memoir [9]<p>&quot;\nIn the 1990s, an eighteen-year-old headed to Australia to realize his worldly dreams. With little money or support, he struggled to survive there. Two years later, he was earning an annual income of $250,000; by the age of twenty-six, he was a multimillionaire. Yet, worldly success was merely a way station on a journey that began years ago.<p>As an eight-year-old, he saw a vision of God in a dream, an experience that left him with a sense of deep joy and peace. The dream triggered off his desire to meet God, to see a manifestation of the Divine. He practiced astrology, intense meditation and tantra, yet God was nowhere in sight. Deeply frustrated, he dived into materialistic pursuits to distract himself from the restlessness within.<p>After years of living the good life, he found he could no longer ignore the old restlessness; worldly pleasures just couldn&#x27;t fill the void within. He moved back to India and finally did what he had always yearned to do: renounce the world and become a monk.<p>In the Himalayas, in terrifying silence and solitude, Om Swami practised intense meditation. Death was always close as he confronted starvation, the fierce elements and wild animals. Finally, his sadhana brought him to the ultimate realization: I am what I have been seeking.<p>This is an astounding memoir of the making of a spiritual life in today&#x27;s challenging and often confusing times.

But the next thought tells us that “what a lowly individual like me can do?” and we end up abandoning the idea of making a change and rather choose acceptance as an excuse.<p>It’s true that one individual could hardly make a difference especially when the whole is collectively working against it. But the same collective efforts channelized in positive direction could make the difference we individually desire.<p>This is the need of the hour. And what do we need to do? 5 minutes meditation once a week on the same topic at the same time from wherever we are [4].<p>From time in memorial, India knows and practices meditation (Yoga) for its evolutionary and liberating effects for body, mind and soul.

While franchise stores aren&#x27;t always bound to follow national promotions (don&#x27;t know about the McDonald&#x27;s franchise agreement), consumer pressure is usually enough to get most franchises to do so.<p>The phenomenon where the 20-piece costs the same as the 10-piece occurs when the 10-piece was already at or above the price point of the 20-piece promotional price. If it was above, you&#x27;ll usually see the price adjusted to match the larger quantity promo&#x27;s price, but rarely see it lowered below.<p>The franchise will get a rebate against their royalty fees to corporate for the 20-piece, in order to maintain a specific profit level above base food cost. They <i>don&#x27;t</i> get a rebate against the sale of the 10-piece, so they have no incentive to make it a more attractive offer, as doing so eats into their own margin. National promotions usually have brutally aggressive pricing, particularly if your store is located in a high cost of living area[1].<p>You&#x27;ll see slightly different pricing behavior at a corporate store, but only about 18% of McDonald&#x27;s are corporate ran[2][3].<p>Now, why McDonald&#x27;s is choosing to aggressively market 20-piece chicken nuggets is something only they know, but may have something to do with the 40% increase in beef prices recently[4].<p>[1]: Personal experience managing several different Domino&#x27;s Pizzas.

The thing leap seconds are tracking &quot;mean solar time&quot; is not something that exists, it&#x27;s a mathematical abstraction; actual solar time differs substantially from mean solar time depending on your location and the time of year. Applications that care about solar time are usually frustrated by leapseconds in any case; since they result in unpredictable discontinuities in the difference between solar time and civil time; and most systems provide no way to report the history of leap seconds to applications.<p>If people still care about solar noon matching civil noon 4000 years from now they simply need shift the timezones by an hour. This is a much safer and more reasonable change which could be planned a hundred years in advance and wouldnt require a constant feed of unpredictable &quot;trusted&quot; leap seconds. Systems already handle mixed timezones well and will continue to do so since computers exist worldwide.<p>As more distributed systems become sensitive to second-scale timing and the cost of reliable oscillators that can keep time autonomously continues to decline the cost of leap-seconds will continue to increase; but the value they provide (primarily political bragging rights about Greenwich being part of the definition of civil time) will remain at practically zero for almost everyone.<p>Workarounds like leap-smear are just that-- workarounds, and add more possible failure modes to leap-second handling and will cause different failure modes for applications that care about time in different ways, e.g. caring about frequency vs time; or just from having even more ways to handle the leap second.<p>Moreover, the discontinuation of leapseconds is simple and nearly costless. Announce that no more will be issued; then don&#x27;t issue anymore of them.",1435474977

I received a copyright infringement notice on both the webplayer as well as the standalone builds. Which is fair enough, really. In light of Nintendo recently making a deal to release some of their IPs on mobile platforms, it’s probably not in their best interests to have a mobile-portable version of Mario 64 sitting around. In any case, I didn’t really expect for this project to get so popular, and was hoping it would function primarily as a educational tool and a novelty. (...)</i>&quot;",1435474896

7323963,comment,7314706,7323594,1,0,nzp,,,"Of course, to not remember exactly what a monoid is is completely fine for a mathematician who&#x27;s field isn&#x27;t abstract algebra and related stuff, but to be clueless as to what the concept is at all is somewhat disturbing.  I would have no problem if they said something like &quot;ah, yeah, it&#x27;s a little simpler than a group, I can&#x27;t remember the exact properties ATM&quot;.<p>Hm, I just gave a quick glance to one group theory textbook (the only one I have in English), and to be honest in the first 20 or so pages there is no mention of the word &quot;monoid&quot; (as far as I can see, I really just quickly scanned through the first chapter) but it does mention semigroups (which are just an identity element away from monoids)...<p>> And I&#x27;m pretty sure in our Algebra books (for CS students, 2 classes in the 1st and 2nd year) there was no much mention of monoids (or, possibly, the professor skipped over those chapters, maybe had some brief explanation and went on to other things).<p>Yeah, and that&#x27;s fine, but for maths students to not even remember that it was mentioned is kind of sad.  It shows they don&#x27;t really care that much about what they&#x27;re doing.  If it wasn&#x27;t even mentioned by the professor, shows a disinterest on his/her part to actually teach concepts.  It&#x27;s always much better when teaching a concept to also at least mention related concepts or similar ones at different levels of abstraction, that gives a complete picture in which you can neatly place things.  A group doesn&#x27;t just appear out of nowhere (although it certainly can be defined on it&#x27;s own), and it&#x27;s not alone...<p>> For example, a surprising percentage of degree-ed Computer Scientists cannot even solve the fizz-buzz problem:<p>Sigh...  I know.  But you see, that&#x27;s why I found this discussion about the unintuitiveness of the word &quot;monad&quot;, here of all places, absurd.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect people who cannot solve fizz-buzz to have any clue about anything, and on some level I&#x27;m fine with that, this is not an elitist rant, but people in a place like this?  After all, programming routinely involves dealing with concepts that are much more unintuitive that a monoid, IMHO.",1393674576

Although English is not always a strong spot, the underlying ability to easily communicate and deal with other people is usually quite strong.  Italians don&#x27;t take home a lot of money compared to other countries, so with lower taxes, their wages could easily be quickly bid up by foreign companies taking advantage of highly skilled labor at competitive prices.<p>> While the Google tax maybe illegal it&#x27;s extremely unfair that big companies have legal means to avoid the standard tax regulations that are in place in a given county<p>As Renzi said, this is something to be dealt with at a European/International level.  Not with some stupid, ineffective law that merely makes Italy look bad, and does next to nothing to Google, merely passing on extra costs to Italian companies.<p>>  This is simply unfair competition as much as China can compete unfairly in some sectors and industries.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage</a><p>There are probably some things where Chinese competition is genuinely &#x27;unfair&#x27;, but that&#x27;s a pretty huge topic, and a lot of their advantage has been low labor costs.  So, unfair in the same sense that Italy has an unfair advantage over Finland in producing quality wine...<p>> How can an Italian company compete on the same grounds with another one if the spread on taxes is more than 35%?<p>Answer: they can&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s part of the reason the economy has stagnated over the past 20 years.

If you take Square&#x27;s 2.75% from $100, that&#x27;s $2.75 off a $20-30 gross margin – or 9.2% to 13.75% of the gross margin.

It&#x27;s like saying a new car has the cost of a small down payment, it&#x27;s completely absurd.<p>A contract phone is just a regular purchase with a payment plan over 24 months AND hopefully a rebate compared to buying the phone cash, since you are bound to the specific company for a period of time.<p>As an example, an iPhone might cost $1 when you sign a $50/mo contract for 24 months. If that contract would be $25 if I keeps my old phone, then the cost of the iPhone is 24 x $25.<p>The bottom line is: the total cost should be easy to calculate, specified on monthly bills (how much is phone payments vs. call costs), and obfuscating the phone payments by masking it as e.g more expensive pre-paid minutes must be outlawed as it makes it impossible to compare the contract to the equivalent contract without the phone.",1393671636

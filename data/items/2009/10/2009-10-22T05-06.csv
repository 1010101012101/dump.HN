Have you ever taught one of the lower grades (elementary school, K-5)?  There're some students that just ""get it"", and others that struggle no matter how many different ways you approach the material.  Some of that's undoubtedly family background - how much value the family places on education, whether they've been exposed to intellectual concepts early, etc.  But I really doubt <i>all</i> of it is, particularly given differences even between siblings.  And I doubt that determination factors into it much at that age, given the average willpower of a 6-year-old...<p>I've also noticed very few intrinsic differences in learning <i>among my peers</i>.  But remember that a peer, by definition, is an equal.  I can't really place my peers as being smarter or dumber, but that's because they've all made it through elite colleges already and been through the Google hiring process.  If I broaden my sample out to ""everyone I've known during my lifetime"", there're some really stark differences in learning, and some of the people who struggled the most were just as determined or moreso than I was, and they continued to struggle despite approaching the material through several different angles.",1256191118

896279,comment,896092,896260,0,0,andreyf,,,"This particular hack, yes, but the general point stands. Sometimes hacks make for great code. The point is that <i>this</i> is good code:<p><pre><code>    float h = 0.5f*x;
    int i = *(int*)&x;
    i = 0x5f3759df - (i>>1);
    x = *(float*)&i;
    return x*(1.5f - h*x*x);
</code></pre>
That's 3 local variables, 5 short statements... makes me wonder how quickly one could search/test all combinations of sensible 5-statement functions to find other such ""hacks""...",1256190898

896276,comment,896113,896161,0,0,Confusion,,,"<i>I was suddenly surrounded by people that were orders of magnitude better at computer science than I was. I had to study for hours to understand something they seemed to understand implicitly.</i><p>I think <i>seemed</i> is the key word here. Many people that are good at what they do give the impression that it's a breeze for them. When examining it closer, it isn't: they spend plenty of time studying. I've never really gotten to the bottom of it, but the difference seems to be that they simply talk less about the studying and more about the material itself, which gives the impression they know their stuff very well, even though they studied hard as well.",1256190521
896273,comment,896113,896113,0,0,ztravis,,,"I've come across this line of reasoning before (in reference to the study with math problems/telling kids they're smart versus hard working) but I'm not sure if I believe this is particular to being designated as smart.  In fact, I would imagine that telling students that they're not in the 'smart' range, or having peers designated as smart while they are not, is more damaging to academic motivation/leads to more fears and emotional distress.  I think both are just manifestations of an underlying fear of being judged, regardless of the expectations - fears of not living up to high expectations, or confirming low ones, or in general moving from a comfortable position of uncertainty in one's skill/intelligence (leaving open the possibility of it being  unexpectedly high) to a better defined and therefore less appealing position.<p>(you might argue that labeling a child as 'not smart' or at least not singling out a child as 'smart' might motivate them to prove the evaluation wrong - but I think those cases are by far the exception rather than the rule)<p>Now, the label of 'hard working' is on a very different scale from intelligence; I can understand how calling kids 'smart' rather than 'hard working' could decrease their performance.  Nevertheless, over the course of our academic lives I think we all get a sense of how we fit in, intelligence-wise, even if we aren't explicitly labeled, from grades, peer performance, parent/teacher expectations and evaluations... the smart ones fear being 'found out' as dumb or tarnishing their reputations, the 'dumb' ones fear (even more, I would imagine) the criticism or negative evaluation of their work they expect to be forthcoming, the average ones fear being confirmed as merely average...",1256189967
896271,comment,896113,896234,0,0,andreyf,,,"Summary: That's not ""smart"". That's ""experienced"", which is an integral of ""determined"" over time.<p>Reasoning: Is it intrinsic that Einstein needs 25 tries, or is it because he also knows ""fetch"", ""lay"", ""roll over"", and ""play dead""? It's a very important distinction, and most usage of ""smart"" implies the former - intrinsic ability. That's the difference between ""smart"" and ""experienced"".<p>Among my peers, however, I don't see any intrinsic differences in learning whatsoever. If person A needs less iteration than person B to learn the classwork, she's either more determined or has more related experience (or both). The two go hand-in-hand, because experience is just the integral of determination over time. Intrinsic ""smartness"" is completely unnecessary in describing learning ability.",1256189742

896263,comment,896113,896240,0,0,tel,,,"It makes a ton of sense when if you concede that every single time you say it (well, really, say anything) it's done in context. You rarely say someone is ""smart, without qualification"" and even if you did it really absolutely means something more like ""smart in most of the ways I admire and have observed that person performing"".<p>Which is really total agreement with your point.

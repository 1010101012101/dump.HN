I actually would have done Computer Science, but the university's program didn't teach the things I was interested in -- but let me be clear: computers were my primary passion.<p>I got a software engineering job offer after graduation, but I decided to go to grad school instead and I'm now finishing a masters in Computer Science. When I started, I was worried that not having a BS in Computer Science would handicap me compared to other students, but it didn't seem to (or at least grad school is hard enough for everyone that I didn't stand out).<p>My work and my interests are in Free Software, and what I'm finding out in applying for jobs is that companies (especially those that deal with Free Software) care very much about your contributions to Free Software. It's obviously easier to get a handle on someone's skills if their entire portfolio of work is available in public git repositories.<p>In working with different projects, I've also gotten to know developers who work on the teams that I'm applying for jobs on. I feel like this gives an extra advantage that's not easily available in other fields.<p>The summary of this is that the degree doesn't matter so much. What matters (at least in the world of Free Software) is what have you contributed and who have you worked with.<p>Another data point: a number of really good software developers at Red Hat have non-computer degrees or no degrees at all.<p>Owen Taylor (GNOME) - Physics<p>Jerome Glisse (AMD driver) - PhD in Biology<p>Matthew Garret (Kernel, power management) - PhD in Biology<p>Ben Skeggs (Nouveau driver) - no degree",1335646775

3904074,comment,3903705,3904066,11,0,pmjordan,,,"CE and UL certifications get checked on import as far as I know. At $2.79, I doubt the author paid any import duty, so the parcel presumably never even went through the relevant office. I doubt regulation on such parcels could be done cost-effectively, it's probably more realistic for eBay to alert users to the problem. But then eBay might lose out on a bit of business and also, the manufacturers probably would get wise to it and print fake UL and CE logos on the device. And even if you educate people on the issue, a 90% lower price will be very tempting for many.<p>You could make eBay legally liable for missing or faked certifications, but that would basically just force them to cut out a bunch of categories of goods. So they'd get listed under another category etc. etc. I don't think there's a solution to this, and only high profile cases of these things actually blowing up in people's faces and electrocuting toddlers will change anything (probably the legal situation, and probably for the worse). If we're lucky, this doesn't happen before China becomes sufficiently developed to introduce and enforce their own, similar regulations. Of course, production of this kind of stuff will then just move to developing-nation-du-jour.<p>Meanwhile: Caveat emptor.<p>Another certification circumvention hack is to import the device as components (which don't require certification) and assemble it in the EU (or US, assuming this hack works there too). Obviously infeasible at that sort of price. A game console maker I won't name here did that with their early devkits for a popular console (maybe they all do it?) to get them to developers quickly. There's no way they would have passed CE certification, as their cases frequently built up a static charge, shocking unsuspecting developers. One even blew up in our office.

The blog is complaining that Paypal actually converts it to 2,474 CHF, a fee of 62 CHF.<p>The title of the blog post is very misleading and baity.  Fees to convert like this are completely normal and you will find them with just about every money service.<p>Banks and financial institutes will offer two different rates for buying and selling.  The difference between the two is known as the spread and is how banks make money.  A lot of high street retailers dress up their expensive currency conversion fees by saying ""0% commission to exchange money!"", although technically true they often have very expensive spreads.<p>An example would be Thomson buying USD at a rate of 1.3169 and selling at a rate of 1.0910 (the rate they show on a screenshot on their homepage).  I come along with 1000 they give me $1091.  If I don't spend any of it and come back to swap back to  they will give me 828 for my $1091.  That's a nice tasty profit of 172 which originates entirely from the ludicrously expensive spreads these types of places offer.  Don't forget though, 0% commission!<p>As much as I dislike Paypal their fees are OK.  We pay a Brazilian artist in $r from , and the total fees for the transaction are around 50-60.  Compared to high street solutions it's pretty much in line with them and only around 10-15 more expensive which we're OK to pay for the convenience.  I am not a fan of spreads being hidden in this way but unfortunately it's standard in the industry and there's very little chance of ever escaping it as it's incredibly lucrative for the money exchanges.<p>Interestingly I've found the type of currency with the most abysmal spreads to be travellers cheques, I avoid these like the plague now.<p>Good luck finding a way to exchange money without having to pay an expensive spread.  As much as I generally am not Paypal's biggest fan this blog post seems to be a lot of noise over nothing.<p>If you're going on holiday, the cheapest way to exchange your money is to swap it with someone from that country coming to visit your country!  You both save a lot of money.  If only there was a service that could match these types of people up...<p>I'm looking forward to Stripe being available in the UK at some point, they advertise 'no hidden fees'.  When I contacted them to ask about the spread they offer they assured me that they would consider an adjusted spread for their benefit a hidden fee, and that they give the customers the same spreads as the bank make available to them.",1335645001

Part of the reason for the perceived incompatibility is that a web browser is not an ordinary app. A web browser is an environment in which most people spend most of their time. It's almost like an OS in itself, with its own UI paradigms such as tabs and add-on bars. Therefore browser designers put in a lot of effort trying to polish their UI exactly the way they want, and it's not easy to reconcile that with the native UI of several different OSes. It'll take time, especially since all the OSes are in the process of revolutionizing their own UIs.",1335644446

Irrelevant.  So too with taxation.  You can talk about moral imperatives all you want -- one should support the country you're in by paying taxes.  Irrelevant.<p>You make tangible objects float in mid-air by altering the law of gravity, or by using magnificent quantities of effort (e.g., fly tons of metal through the sky by burning vast quantities of fuel).<p>You (as a government) make money change course and come to rest elsewhere by altering the law of taxation or by using magnificent quantities of rhetoric (look for ""should"" and ""ought"" and ""them"" in sentences).

Countries have sovereignty and can do as they damn well please.<p>The U.S. has the bullying power of the U.S. dollar and a lot of guns to convince other countries to behave in ways that the U.S. wants them to behave.  This will work until it doesn't work anymore.<p>The way this will cease working for the U.S. government is that the bullying will become unacceptable for other governments.  They will rightly see this as ceding national sovereignty to the U.S. government.  This will not happen until the U.S. dollar weakens and a plausible reserve currency appears.  China's slow moves to relaxing currency controls tells you where the next likely reserve currency will be.<p>The other way this will cease working is visible in the cited article. Large economic organizations -- like Apple -- are starting to develop their own anti-gravitation fields and can float above tax laws of any particular country.<p>It's fun to watch.  Put your moral imperatives in your pocket for a while and just observe.  What is Congress doing, and why?

There are NON-PROFIT insurance companies that do an excellent job of spreading that risk around (Kaiser Permanente spends 95% of its insurance dues actually paying for medical care, for example). When you buy insurance you're not EXPECTING to have a problem, but you want to be protected if you do. When someone DOES have a problem, the insurance company hasn't ""screwed up"" -- the entire point of insurance is to cover unexpected problems.<p>The only time that the insurance company could be said to have screwed up is if they're losing money overall.

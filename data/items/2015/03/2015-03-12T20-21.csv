So not sure the pros and cons between Pinball and Luigi.<p>When we build pinball, we aim to build a scalable and flexible workflow manager to satisfy the the following requirements (I just name a few here).<p>1. easy system upgrade - when we fix bug or adding new features, there should be no interruption for current running workflow and jobs.
2. easy add/test workflow - end user can easily add new jobs and workflows into pinball system, without affecting other running jobs and workflows.
3. extensibility - a workflow manager should be easy to extended. As the company and business grows, there will be a lot new requirements and features needed. And also we love your contributions as well.
4. flexible workflow scheduling policy, easy failure handling.
5. We provide rich UI for you to easily manage your workflows
   - auto retry failed job, 
   - you can retry failed job, can skip some job, can select a subset of jobs of a workflow to run (all from UI)
   - you can easily access all the running history of your job, and also get the stderr, stdout logs of your jobs

I&#x27;m given to understand 成龍 means Jackie Chan.<p>However good notation doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be intuitive; we&#x27;re talking in English and English is <i>definitely</i> not intuitive. That is to say that &quot;person&quot; doesn&#x27;t look anything like a person.<p>Just as we learn to fit the concept of addition into our mind with the unintuitive + symbol, I find it useful to fit the concepts of K into my mind.<p>It is worth learning.<p>On your second point, you may not realise this yet, but you&#x27;ve invented a new programming language. There&#x27;s no &quot;syntax layer&quot; and &quot;language layer&quot;, because language is just the tool our mind uses to express problems and I believe that the lexemes used to express that language become a part of our brains when we try to solve problems in it. With that in mind, you will understand what I mean when I say: You have a language for expressing solutions; a notation, and I&#x27;ll explain what I meant when I said I thought the notation was terrible:<p>First: C is also useful. Arthur writes K in C, so he might have a function like this:<p><pre><code>    K fun(K x,K y){K(&quot;+/+*\\:&quot;);return apply2(g,x,y);}
</code></pre>
The K macro is basically:<p><pre><code>    #define K(s) static K g;if(!g)g=parse(s);
</code></pre>
He doesn&#x27;t write it this way. It would probably be more like:<p><pre><code>    K2(fun){K(&quot;+/+*\\:&quot;);R ap2(g,x,y);}
</code></pre>
but that&#x27;s because the compact notation is useful.<p>This isn&#x27;t the only good example I&#x27;ve seen: Zeta-C was a C implementation in Common Lisp. You could &quot;switch to lisp&quot; in Zeta-C just by writing an @-sign before the lisp form, i.e.<p><pre><code>    int fun(int x, int y) {
      return @(stuff:mmu |x| |y|);
    }
</code></pre>
ECL uses a pre-processor that allows you to write C code in it similarly. This is what mixing two languages looks like when done well: It looks like it belongs there, and it&#x27;s useful for more than just being able to call Lisp functions from C: Those things could be Lisp macros(!) and even be mixed in C macros giving the programmer an incredible flexibility in expressing themselves!<p>What you&#x27;ve got is a notation with an <i>edge</i>. I can see where the C/Perl is, and where your &quot;other notation&quot; is (i,j,etc), and I don&#x27;t like it. I <i>feel</i> the code switch snap loudly in my mind the same way I feel when I see a <?php<p>You could have made it look like it belonged there, and people could dip into your language easily. It would certainly be more work, but the notation would be better. Perhaps when you flesh out all the things you want to do you will consider revisiting this.",1426193390

You can download an HL7 or XML-parsing library and the dirtiness of the representation is converted to JSON or whatever works for you.<p>The problem is API loopholes.<p>HL7 does a pretty fair job defining what concepts get put into which fields.  However, many implementations ignore the computer-readable fields and literally dump everything as 80-character human-readable console outputs in the &quot;custom text&quot; fields.  Want any structured data?  You&#x27;re gonna have to write a text parser specific to the hospital&#x27;s legacy console systems.<p>There&#x27;s also a good deal of standardization over how things SHOULD be presented (ICD-9 etc), but those are ignored.  Often times physicians or pharmacists just type the drug into a free-text box.  5 different spellings of Ampicillin are the least of your worries -- it gets bad when the dosage is mixed in with the name, and it gets worse once you get into compounds or mixes.  The standard isn&#x27;t the problem, its the data mapping problem for all the human-inputs.<p>And then you get into fun stuff where billing people use different codes than everyone else for the same drugs, procedures, admissions, etc (there&#x27;s a reason billing admins are so highly paid... it&#x27;s a black art where you get creative how you describe things to the insurance companies).<p>All of this is to say that I would love to see a RESTful, well-modelled API over HL7 messages, but the problems go far deeper than the protocol spec (and that&#x27;s just for technical side of things... the politics and business threats of open APIs that the article talks about are completely true as well).

Its similar to haskell type classes but you need to be explicit...
* Instantiating a polymorphic hash table is a bit ugly but thats more about the standard library...
* There is no &quot;default dict&quot; function so you would need to initialize the counts yourself
* Looping the file is not hard. Most data structures will have some sort of &quot;fold&quot; or &quot;iter&quot; function you can use.
* The sorting function doesn&#x27;t take keys, so you need to use a comparator instead. Its not that bad though - the function to convert a hash table into a list already returns a list of tuples.",1426192837

Shit happens, and we need to plan accordingly instead of trying to prevent the shit in the first place. Oddly enough, I don&#x27;t see worldwide media focusing on the private aviation hobby and how dangerous it is to everyone even though he landed <i>on a fucking golf course</i>. But no, one drone lands on the White House lawn and it&#x27;s a national emergency with firmware updates pushed by DJI in response to <i>ban Washington, D.C.</i><p>My work, as I point out elsewhere in this thread, is to educate folks about the positive uses for drone technology and the industry that&#x27;s about to happen. The possibilities of extending our senses into the air around us are endless. I&#x27;ve had people come up to me while operating in public and threaten me and my equipment. People are shooting at drones with some frequency in the more backwater parts of the United States. I&#x27;m waiting for one of those bullets to land a few miles away and kill a child, because I predict the backlash will be against the fliers, not the shooters.<p>I often feel like I&#x27;m pushing, hopelessly against the avalanche of media fearmongering, because this technology has real, potent uses that should appeal to this community of startup tinkerers and hobbyists. We could be investing in automatic technology to build upon TCAS and integrate commercial UAS into that system, but we&#x27;re not: we&#x27;re trying to prevent the industry from ever happening.<p>Imagine the Wright Brothers trying to tinker in today&#x27;s regulatory climate. Remember how all of us fought against classifying our hobby as &quot;drones,&quot; even though it&#x27;s technically correct, because most peoples&#x27; exposure to the word &quot;drone&quot; is centered around Hellfire-carrying platforms? Yeah, this is why.",1426192267

It wasn&#x27;t a long term occupation with ISAF essentially playing peacekeepers within the country. The US basically destroyed most of the Iraqi military and then withdrew after a peace agreement was struck.<p>The Iraqi military the US faced during the invasion in 2003 was a shadow of its former self, and during the occupation obviously they were fighting an insurgency. It&#x27;s a terrible comparison. A more suitable example might be the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which is similar in many important respects, but the doctrine followed by each military was vastly different. The Soviets killed indiscriminately during their occupation. Their strategy was generally to seek out and kill every person in the direction from which they were shot at. This very article shows that there are multiple levels of approval that must be sought before the order to kill is given.

Your logic falls down when you understand YouTube&#x27;s ad system. An ad can run on your video in any number of circumstances, monetized or not.<p>I am directly impacted by this due to my work to educate folks about proper, safe drone usage given media mischaracterization and fearmongering (like that recent Audi ad) about drones. All of my videos are artistic in nature and work to educate the public on the positive, market-generating usages of drones, such as aerial filmmaking, land survey, search and rescue, and other uses. Your comment smacks of lacking all of the context around FAA enforcement against drone fliers in recent years, and rushing to defend an agency that has burned all positive relationships it ever had with the hobbyist industry, both drones and otherwise.<p>The FAA has repeatedly missed deadlines to get its shit together, and is on track to miss another that was set by Congress for the end of this year. In the meantime, they&#x27;ve devoted their resources to pursuing drone fliers in court (and losing, quite dramatically, on taxpayer dollars) and sending toothless cease and desist notices like this. Nobody with an ounce of common sense can possibly conclude what you have, that a YouTube ad suddenly makes the flight commercial. If a private pilot records the view out of his cockpit window and then puts ads on the video on YouTube, he&#x27;s not suddenly a (potentially unlicensed) commercial operator.<p>It follows that this action is just another excuse for the FAA to harass drone pilots and people attempting to build a multi-million dollar industry in the United States. Nothing about this is sane, and the FAA is repeatedly demonstrating that it&#x27;s happy to service those with money and who can make noise in government -- the sudden (and rapid) creation of the certification exemption program for law enforcement <i>after</i> DHS started flying Predators over the border, for example -- while pinching the rest of us in court.

The FAA letter makes reference to this at the bottom of page one.<p>Flying in that manner is against the regulations of the AMA.<p>I suspect that the reason the FAA letter even mentions the word &quot;commercial&quot; is because there are basically three ways to fly UAV that the FAA considers legal:<p>1.

Commercial -- requires the appropriate licenses and permits from the FAA with strict guidelines on the restrictions for any given flight.<p>3.

But during a cursory reading of Yarvin&#x27;s I&#x27;ve found a few mentions of feudalism as a desired goal (obviously, under some weak autocracy), as well as mentions of traditional gender roles and a defense of slavery. I also believe that Peter Thiel funds Yarvin through a startup company of his. I will not list the false accounts he mentions (I noted down a few so far), because I don&#x27;t want to discuss the subject here. A cursory glance, though, reveals the Dark Enlightenment to be a fascinating Californian fringe movement, with some truly novel interpretations of familiar ideologies (mostly fascism, but not quite, as fascism was directly influenced by Romanticism while DE rejects Romanticism except that restricted Ayn-Randian form of it, and fascism was very much nationalistic -- again, through romantic influence -- while DE isn&#x27;t).<p>As to your description of the Gilded Age, I am not sure what our points of disagreement are. Yes, the Pinkertons weren&#x27;t actual armies, nor were they entirely ignored by the government. My description was greatly simplified for brevity. As to the conditions of workers at the time, comparisons to other societies are irrelevant, because that economic growth (which was the result of immigration, land expansions and new resources) was not at all contingent on the exploitation that was taking place.<p>In general, comparisons are often less useful when the framing discussion (in this case, questions of policy) is normative. If a tyrant comes to an island where the population is starving, and feeds them a loaf of bread a day but forces them to do backbreaking work for him, then their position is better than the alternative, but no one would suggest that this is in any way desirable or even ethical. The same would be true for another tyrant who feeds his enslaved population two loaves of bread a day.<p>Comparisons are useful if the claim is made that no other policy would have been possible, which I don&#x27;t think anyone is making. Sure, growth would have been slower (concentrated power is always a lot more efficient, as time and resources are not required to achieve compromise and accommodate other stakeholders), but preference of efficiency over other human goals is purely a matter of value.<p>The Bolsheviks instituted an autocratic form of communism, which is pretty much the complete opposite of feudalism (which is usually the result of a free market, although the terms are anachronistic as no one used the term &quot;free market&quot;, when real feudalism was actually in place), and in any case, feudalism is certainly anathema to any ideology promoting equality (like communism).",1426190712

First, the <i>donor</i> pays the gift tax, unless an agreement is in place for the recipient to do so. The controlling case is <i>Dickman v. Commissioner</i>, 465 U.S. 330 (1984), and the basic idea is that, if you have a recognizable property right, foregoing the commercial use of that property in favor of providing it at a discounted rate creates a recognized gift. The gift amount is determined by the fair market rental value of the property. (This gets around the concern of the poster below about how you&#x27;re supposed to declare income you <i>didn&#x27;t</i> receive.)<p>Gift taxes are really just a method of checking large-scale tax evasion schemes where someone gifts assets to family members; to ameliorate the effects, there&#x27;s a $14K/person/year exclusionary zone (plus other exemptions and methods to reduce liabilities) where you don&#x27;t have to declare or worry about gifts.<p>Technically, couch-surfing probably wouldn&#x27;t trigger the IRS&#x27; interest (not sure even they would try to figure out the fair-market value of a couch and a blanket), but giving someone a room (let alone the full use of a rental property) would in fact be a taxable event. However, it&#x27;s unlikely, even in the Bay Area, that the value of that would rise above the $14K/person gift exclusion. In <i>Dickman</i>, the parents had to give a <i>lot</i> of interest-free loans to trigger the IRS&#x27; interest.",1426190708

Flying an extension of you (your drone) is even worse because you have even less interest in the safety since in a mid-air collision between planes, you die too. If your drone hits my plane - you do not die. Want to fly? Get a license. Want to fly a drone? Still get a license!<p>What you ask (FAA to leave the issue alone) is akin to letting 2 year olds drive 18-wheelers on the roads you drive your kids to school on?

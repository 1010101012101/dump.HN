It helps to rebuild when you upgrade in case you start using new functionality (so the indexes get computed correctly), but running an old system would work fine.<p>EDIT: note that you won&#x27;t necessarily be able to run with indexes from multiple versions back. We&#x27;ll almost certainly prune the backwards compatibility code to only a few releases to keep the codebase clean and nimble, and to keep difficult to diagnose bugs to a minimum. But it&#x27;s still a very convenient feature release-to-release, as you can upgrade, and then rebuild indexes at your convenience.",1409090388

8229779,comment,8226654,8229727,6,0,_delirium,,,"I think that was the initial impetus, and is what made English the <i>lingua franca</i>. But now that it is, it has a life of its own where people are using it even for communication entirely between Europeans. If you want to have a site dedicated to Northern European politics, where Dutch, Swedes, Germans, Estonians, and Poles all post, what language is it going to be in? English, of course, even if not a single American or British person ever reads or posts. Why are all the Danish government websites translated to English? Not so Americans can read them, but so people from other European countries can read them, along with recent immigrants (who are mainly Germans, Turks, and Arabs). The EU institutions are moving towards English as the main working language for the same reason, because it&#x27;s the easiest way for a German and a Swede (say) to communicate; with the French being the main holdouts.<p>In the Nordic region in particular the huge dissimilarity between Scandinavian languages and Finnish is driving it imo. If the cultural bloc were only Norway/Denmark/Sweden, I think it would settle on a kind of &quot;Scandinavian&quot; (their written forms are mutually intelligible). But that would exclude Finns from the Nordic family, so the working language has to be English, whether it&#x27;s in formal institutions like the Nordic Council, or informal ones like <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Nordiccountries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Nordiccountries</a>. I think this is only going to accelerate, and Americans will gradually become a smaller proportion of English-language online posters than they used to be, as the younger generation of Europeans who are comfortable in English become more present in anglophone contexts.

That&#x27;s what I associate with the EU, the wish to overcome our historic differences and build a political union that is up to our globalized world, something strong enough to defend the values we share. And also the dream to live in a more united world. For example, when I worked in Switzerland for half a year, there were all those little things that acutely showed me that I was a second class resident. In other EU countries I&#x27;ve got more of a feeling of having a right to be there, not being just tolerated or granted a favor.<p>Maybe as a German I&#x27;m also a little bit insensitive to national identities.

In fact, Firefox will soon include an IDE[2], so you don&#x27;t even need a text editor anymore. I think that will have a massive impact on how many developers will make apps for Firefox OS, especially local developing world apps.<p>If you only have non-administrator access to a computer in an internet cafe or some other shared computer, you can probably still develop Firefox OS apps since it may already have Firefox installed. Additionally, there&#x27;s millions of tutorials online about web development, many of which are very beginner friendly and in multiple languages.<p>This extremely low barrier to entry will allow local communities to easily make apps that cater to just their local needs. Want to know where the best location to get water is? Want to know which farms in the area are hiring? Want to see the local mayor&#x27;s latest scandalous photo? These all can be coded in a weekend at the local internet cafe.<p>EDIT: Also, where can I buy one?<p>[1] - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3MU3jxEye8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3MU3jxEye8</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE</a>",1409087863

8229556,comment,8229081,8229393,4,0,napoleoncomplex,,,"I was thinking of taxi legislation as the example (EU city example, can&#x27;t speak for the US). Taxis in my city need to be registered and the drivers need to have a taxi license, the cars need to have prices clearly listed on their window, as well as the driver&#x27;s ID visible in the car. All of this is due to consumers getting repeatedly ripped off, complaining about it to the city&#x27;s politicians, which then wrote up the regulations. The consumers are much better protected now, and have a clear channel for complaints.<p>To me that is clearly a consequence of consumers wanting more regulation. Same as with perishable products having to be clearly marked with its due date in stores, and practically every consumer protection law/regulation out there.<p>Not saying that these laws can&#x27;t be abused, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the consumers aren&#x27;t the main reason behind their existence.",1409087218

Like I said above, this has now made its way into Torch7/Lua.<p>Anyone who works with arrays and matrix math for a living needs to look at an array based language to see how it is done properly. J is the one I&#x27;ve been futzing with. It&#x27;s a rough learning curve, as the language looks like line noise to the uninitiated. The upside is it teaches you a lot about how the array parts of other languages should work; vectorizing R or Matlab certainly becomes more obvious. As a bonus, it can be amazingly fast: single threated SVD in native J matches lapack speeds on big problems. Stuff like J encapsulates decades of insight into programming, particularly with arrays, that is mostly forgotten in modern programming languages. Learning an APL is the same sort of experience as learning Lisp: &quot;why doesn&#x27;t everything work this way?&quot; Definitely a productivity boost if you can do a project in J; you can replace pages of Java with a line of J. That line might take a while to write if you haven&#x27;t been J-ing for a decade, but it&#x27;s still a productivity boost. As a bonus, J comes with a decent columnar database built in. It isn&#x27;t concurrent yet, but it&#x27;s pretty good for medium sized problems, and unlike something like Redshift, you can do some fancy math on the data directly using J verbs.<p>I don&#x27;t want to crap all over Julia, but it&#x27;s pretty obviously a student project. I&#x27;m sure its compiler is better than that of Lush, but Lush was designed for people needing to solve real problems. Julia definitely has more momentum, but frankly, I&#x27;ll stick with R/Torch7/J until Julia has proved useful for something.",1409087101

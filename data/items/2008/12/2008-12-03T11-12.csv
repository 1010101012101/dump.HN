I've been using I Want Sandy and I really regret you've chosen to close it down. I hope you reconsider your decision. Some people pay $x for service $foo, so I'm sure many wouldn't mind paying $x+1 for Sandy.

I don't own an iPhone, but this would practically be a killer app for me.<p>A relatively simple concept, but I think the iPhones user interface could be excellent at it, and I think it could be extremely popular within a niche. There's a lot of scope for features and development, and you could certainly charge more than $5 considering the real cost of a graphics calculator.<p>It could also be better than current graphics calculators in some ways despite the lack of physical buttons - every graphics calculator I've ever used has seriously struggled with making a decent UI.",1228304740

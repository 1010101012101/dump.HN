40417,comment,40222,40409,0,0,vlad,,,"You used the word misconceptions, but I don't think I was wrong about anything I said if you read what I wrote carefully.<p>I'm not sure where you disagree since you are defensive about GWT, when I never said it was bad, just that using a web framework is a much better idea, especially at first.  <p>How can you predict how many users GWT might have in the future when Adobe Flex and Apollo are around the corner?  <p>On the other hand, the server-side coding won't change from PHP, Python, or Ruby for most startups over the next year, however, and their web frameworks are much easier to use and integrate than GWT.<p>I like GWT, but I think it requires at least one or two additional orders of magnitude of time to get something going.  Plus, you'd still have to write server-side code to handle the ajax calls, so you may as well need to start with a web framework anyway!<p>And remember, you don't have to compile all the time with web frameworks.<p>Finally, the ""major"" releases you mention have been very minor. For example, One of the VERY few releases GWT has had in the past 8 months involved Google changing their source to be open source, without making any improvements that I can remember.<p>If you started with a toolset, you should stay with it.  But if you're starting a new project, use a web framework.<p>What would be great is if this prediction comes true:<p><a href=""http://getahead.org/blog/joe/2007/05/11/googles_next_open_source_project.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getahead.org/blog/joe/2007/05/11/googles_next_open_so...</a>",1186555672

Pylons is much better for serious programming - Django is better if you want to make a run of th e mill app like a blog. Using Pylons is like working  with Lego bricks - stuff is swappable easily - not so with Django.",1186555600

40409,comment,40222,40380,0,0,edgeztv,,,"There are a few misconceptions about GWT in the above comment:<p>""most frameworks are evolving FAR quicker than GWT is.""<p>GWT is only a year old and has had 4 major releases.  It just went open-source recently, so it's too early to tell how fast it will evolve.<p>""GWT does not have anywhere near the community or IRC users that most frameworks do.""<p>GWT community is huge - there are over 600 posts a week on its Google Group.  I'm not aware of an IRC channel for it though.<p>""using GWT can be even slower than using traditional desktop development tools like Visual Studio because you not only have to compile, but also upload the files to get a real idea of what you're doing.""<p>No, you only need to upload files when you're actually doing a release.",1186553984

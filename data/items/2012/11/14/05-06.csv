A lot of alternative fuel sources are in remote and underserved locations (Iceland has lots of geothermal); it's economically worthwhile to ship bauxite there, but not worthwhile to build a HVDC circuit to power a plant in downtown London from Icelandic power.<p>An even more clear example is that natural gas is about 30% the price in the US Midwest as it is in Europe or the rest of the world market.

I personally care far more about other forms of pollution (especially localized) than CO2; I don't think global warming is a non-issue, but it's not the #1 environmental issue.  Point sources of particulates, NO2, etc. should be taxed as well as maximum emissions specified (obviously a steel mill should be allowed to emit more, and pay for it, at full production in an efficient way, than a badly adjusted oil-fired school furnace, even if the school chooses to ignore economic rationality.)",1352872632
4782209,comment,4781939,4781939,2,0,gruseom,,,"Why have we discovered so few local optima outside of general-purpose programming? There are important classes of problems that don't require the full complexity of a general language. It can be much simpler to solve those in a limited language, and that gives the programmer more power. Limited languages also give implementers more power, since they can exploit invariants that hold for programs written in that language, that are not true of programs written in general languages, to gain efficiency wins. This is why the author is able to say that Mawk ""wins on both LOC and performance criteria  a rare feat indeed, transcending the usual competition of slow-but-easy scripting languages versus fast-but-hard compiled languages"". The fact that that kind of win-win can't be had in general-purpose languages seems like a strong incentive to pursue more specialized ones.<p>I wonder how many subspaces there are that are small enough to be exploitable in this way yet large enough to address valuable classes of problems.

I mention this because of this statement:<p>> When we drop down to the algorithm level, I think OO can seriously thwart reuse. In particular, the use of objects to represent simple informational data is almost criminal in its generation of per-piece-of-information micro-languages, i.e. the class methods, versus far more powerful, declarative, and generic methods like relational algebra. Inventing a class with its own interface to hold a piece of information is like inventing a new language to write every short story. This is anti-reuse, and, I think, results in an explosion of code in typical OO applications. Clojure eschews this and instead advocates a simple associative model for information. With it, one can write algorithms that can be reused across information types.",1352872486

Cigarette taxes are a great example -- I think the economy overall would be better off if there were 0% revenue on a $50/pack cigarette tax, as it would save health care and other costs far higher than the revenue on a $0.50/pack cigarette tax.  Or, a local tax per-bag of trash produced, in excess of direct disposal taxes, in an attempt to capture the external costs of waste.

4782200,comment,4781894,4782032,7,0,hackinthebochs,,,"> It's strength is that it allows the business rules to be most directly mapped to the code that needs to be written.<p>Absolutely this. Discussions around OOP vs functional always seem to ignore this massive boon to productivity that OOP brings. Being able to create something of a DSL and map your business rules onto basic operations on this DSL is a huge win. The trick is to design your objects and operations such that the salient rules ""rise to the top"" of the stack, and thus can be easily programmed and verified at the highest level of abstraction.<p>Of course a DSL comes with its own drawbacks. Having to learn a new ""language"", with operations that are sometimes just renaming more basic operations has an extra cognitive load that can't be ignored. This is why there is a threshold of complexity below which you're better off just writing it straight imperative/functional style.",1352872370

And yeah objects represents information relaying on the standard types the underlaying language provide but the fundamental stuff is not there, actually the standard types relay on the underlying machine, SLA, etc... So they all are just ""repurposing of what's already there"".<p>So my point here is that the same arguments can be applied to any upper abstraction we made to ""make stuff simpler"". But as far as I can see what is behind any of this abstractions or frameworks are the fundamental concepts of <i>reuse</i>, <i>coupling</i> and <i>cohesion</i>. And here is really my point with this replica, the discussion about something being fundamental or not on the computing field, besides than it appears to be a subjective matter, should be in terms of this 3 core concepts and the way the ""tool"" under discussion makes easier to achieve each one as needed.<p>Of course there is a different tool for different works and OOP could be a lot of overhead to solve some kind of problems (Technically talking because OOP is more than just defining bunch of data and functions together). But if the discussion is about computing and specifically to software engineering where reuse is critical, let me say that the way OOP faces the 3 core concepts of software engineering works very well if your problem space can handle the overhead and most of our ""Engineering problems"" and restrictions can handle that for sure IMO.<p>More code is not necessarily a bad signal, not if you are getting real benefits from it, and again its not just simplicity to go and read the code its simplicity modeling your problem so you can reuse your low coupled and high cohesive abstract datatypes.<p>I have posted this replica using the cool replica.la service ;) <a href=""http://www.replica.la/discussions/37"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.replica.la/discussions/37</a>",1352872060

If you are brand new to options and are just starting out then I suggest having a friend/expert help you.  I also suggest you use very little money at first to get a feel for it.

This is true for Straddles or Strangles).<p>After dabbling in options for 6 months I would say that the average person should avoid them at all costs.  You really can lose a lot of money and sleep.  You need to be a certain type of person to do this as a hobby.<p>For those of you willing to take the risk, best of luck to you.  With options, you are better to be lucky than good.

Lists and strings and arrays as implemented in any scripting language can implement virtually any algorithm with only a constant factor performance and memory penalty.

4782149,comment,4779647,4782097,1,0,dumitrue,,,"That's an interesting (and relevant) question. In fact, if you're using something like stochastic gradient descent to optimize the weights of your network, it might be very hard for the network to escape the general local minimum (or basin of attraction) in which it ended after having trained over a large dataset, even if you present it with the same examples but with the labels flipped (which would be the easiest way to ""unlearn"").<p>In <i>theory</i> stochastic gradient descent allows you to escape local minima: the noise in the stochastic error surface will likely be enough for the network to escape whatever minimum it is in. Practically, because weights will tend to have a large magnitude and because most of the times you'll be using a saturating non-linearity (such as a sigmoid), the number of steps required to escape that local minimum might be too big.<p>Presumably, you could use second-order optimization methods to perhaps escape from minima -- because it allows you to make ""bigger"" steps -- but that comes with its own set of problems (negative curvature being one of them).<p>I encourage you to actually test these hypotheses: train a simple network on something stupid like MNIST, and make it achieve a reasonable error with many passes through the data. Then change the labels of 10-20-50% of your inputs and continue training (with the same learning rate... or not!) to see how long it takes for the network to get to another minimum.",1352870905

That's $33/ton in 10 years, $60/ton in 20, and $350/ton in 50 years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-07/obama-may-levy-carbon-tax-to-cut-the-u-s-deficit-hsbc-says.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-07/obama-may-levy-carb...</a>",1352869790

While I've almost never had trouble with code declaring variables near the site where they are first needed, I've on quite a few occasions missed top-level declarations, perhaps because I carried with me a memory of a declaration done in another function (or something like that) ... resulting in major ""global"" catastrophes (sorry ;)<p>While I acknowledge that declaring vars within ifs/whiles and such can lead to misunderstanding, declaring vars close to the site of first use at the top-level block of a function has never resulted in a bug for me. This approach also diffs better.",1352869756

Even if you get a team of a 100 leading code review, malware and security experts in the world I would not bet money that they&#x27;ll be able to scrub anything within a year.\nAnd I would not even attempt to hire a 100 of them, the time it will take to bring them up to speed would be pretty exhaustive, a safer bet would be to have your own developers which worked on the products from year to go over small parts of the code and flag something unusual.<p>If Juniper is smart they&#x27;ll crowd source that internally and have various code snippets pop up on the screens of randomly selected developers and have them being evaluated, when a snippet gets enough flags forward it to an expert and have them review it.\nBut that again only works if a) the backdoor is localized and not staged across various steps in the logic flaw it self, and b) the backdoor is in the actual source code and not only present in the binaries because the tool chain itself was compromised.<p>Life isn&#x27;t simple.",1450691735

Considering Moxie makes a competitive messaging app, making these claims without clearer proof seems a bit reckless. So I would like to know if there is some proof out there that we have missed.<p>So far the responses Moxie and Ptacek have given to multiple requests are:<p>* API shows a string message object stored on server [2]. No clear indication that this is itself not a string representation of an end-to-end encrypted object.<p>* iOS devices receive push notifications indicating Telegram servers must be able to decrypt in order to send plaintext to Apple [3].

This is the type of stuff I&#x27;m very interested in lately.<p>The sources I&#x27;ve found most helpful so far are the books _Mindfulness in Plain English_ and _Beyond Mindfulness in Plain English_.<p>Very briefly, we pretty much already understand the concepts that will allow us to take control of our minds and see what&#x27;s going on clearly, but those are concepts, when what is needed is experience. Meditative states help us gain experiential knowledge, and in the process, we rearrange the plumbing in the basements of our minds. For example, having thoroughly experienced impermanence in meditation, we naturally stop wanting to freeze time or cling to things.<p>I seem to like to make metaphors about fire. In one sense, I see these ideas as possibly helping put out a global wildfire that&#x27;s been raging out of control since the beginning of mankind: people suffer, and, not knowing how to handle their suffering, harm themselves and others, and we respond in anger, when it would be better if we responded with compassion. In another sense, we want to get the fire of compassion lit, to get enough people to awaken that others can see that it&#x27;s an attainable goal.<p>It&#x27;s nothing less than jailbreaking our minds. We have a lot of evidence it&#x27;s possible, just very difficult. But the more people are looking at it, the less subtle these ideas will seem, and the path will hopefully become more and more straightforward. I hope that someday, waking up the way the Buddha did will be a rite of passage for children.",1450691408

They ignore my response. And two weeks later, I see the same person with the same one-liner posting it somewhere else.<p>I find most people don&#x27;t want to understand your reasoning. They simply want things exactly as they want it, or they&#x27;re not happy. I never get anyone willing to have an open dialogue where they&#x27;re actually open to trying new things, even though I am open to hearing any true criticisms that go beyond appeal to tradition (we&#x27;d all be using DOS if that were a valid argument.)<p>Very thankfully, in my case, I&#x27;m not selling a product, and I&#x27;m not funded by advertisements. And as such, I can get away with choosing to ignore certain types of criticism. I&#x27;m very empathetic to those who can&#x27;t.",1450688815

I hadn&#x27;t made that connection before.<p>Having followed Farnam Street for quite some time I must say that the quality of content is quite variable. In the beginning I always read the Sunday newsletter and most of the content was really good and thoughtful. As the site/newsletter has gained traction I feel like the quality have declined a bit unfortunately. I do not read all Sunday newsletters anymore and the ones I do only confirm my suspicion. Of course it&#x27;s free and I can unsubscribe anytime - so no complaint - just a comment.<p>This post however is really good!",1450688763

The book is preachy, and the movie is faithful to the book, which means long monologues.<p>&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was made into a movie in 1949.  It&#x27;s a decent movie, and Amazon has the DVD.  It&#x27;s amusing today because the protagonist, who is an architect, designs buildings that he insists are insanely great, but are just slab-sided office blocks.  (His hatred of decorative spires has something going for it. There used to be a thing for putting useless pointy spires on top of office buildings, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building being the classic examples. That&#x27;s mostly died out in the US, although it still has a following in Dubai and some Asian cities.)<p>Taking Ayn Rand seriously is not good for you.",1450688639

It&#x27;s wildly inaccurate to assume that even a small fraction of the population is in the same boat.  Indeed, if you think I&#x27;m being unfair or elitist, I recommend a few semesters teaching at a state university in the US -- your doubts will surely be erased after that.<p>What <i>most</i> people will infer from such laws is the simplest conclusion: that they reflect reality, and that denying the Holocaust is what stupid people do.  Most people absorb the majority of their views from what they commonly hear and see as being acceptable.  If they see enough people discussing something, no matter how objectively wrong or stupid, they will put it into the category of &quot;subjective things that might be true,&quot; and be done with it.<p>Ironically, many intelligent people are blind to this, because it is so far from how they operate themselves.",1450688437

787112,comment,786985,787049,0,0,chime,,,"I would disagree with that. This doesn't apply just to vacation itineraries but more so to projects you are either thinking of starting yourself or are being invited to join. This being Hacker News, many of us here get ample opportunities to join software projects that seem interesting. From open-source utilities to apps built on the latest frameworks, we have more than enough ways to keep us busy if we so choose. Many of the founders working on their primary startups have second or third pet ideas that they always want to work on but can never find the time to. That is what this ""hell yeah!"" is about.<p>From personal experience, I can say that in 2007 and 2008, I got into the habit of saying ""ok yes"" to every project that came across my way. A couple of those projects got me ample fame (Wired.com front page, TC, newspaper articles) and some even got me pretty good income. However, having too many things that needed to be done at the same time left me feeling unaccomplished, unhealthy, and frankly miserable, despite the fact that I was building some pretty neat things.<p>I decided to change things earlier this year and now I've stopped working on any side projects other than my main job. As side projects, I've started training for ultramarathons.  It has absolutely nothing to do with computers but I find it a lot more satisfying personally than ""yet another website idea."" When I asked myself if I want to run one hundred miles in 36 hours non-stop, I immediately said ""HELL YEAH!"" So I started training.<p>A few months into the training, I got a bit jealous of all these startups getting funding and fame, so I thought about working on a startup again. I had a few ideas, some old and some new but none of them screamed ""HELL YEAH!"" Nevertheless, I bought a domain or two, built a logo/theme, and thought if I just crossed over the initial hurdle of disinterest, I'd find the excitement to continue. It never happened. I still think that one of my ideas is solid and it could work quite well. However, it just doesn't scream ""HELL YEAH!"" to me right now so for the moment, it is on the sidelines.<p>On the other hand, I'm getting more and more excited by the day because my 100-mile race ( <a href=""http://chir.ag/20090621"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chir.ag/20090621</a> ) is coming up soon - Sept 5-6. It has been exciting throughout the duration, though I felt miserable, overworked, and weak many times. The take-home lesson for me is that the passion doesn't dwindle though the motivation, strength, and energy might waver frequently. Once the passion is gone, so is the project. ""HELL YEAH!"" is passion and if you don't have that for something, don't dive head-first into it at the risk of rest of your life.",1251293521

I would guess that the experimental data has a very narrow view of what an incentive is and has a very narrow view of what the problem space is.  \neverything that people do is based on incentives.  people don't go to work for the satisfaction of it.  that some tests showed that additional task based rewards don't work well (probably because it introduces competitive behavior in a non-competitive problem space: creativity) doesn't mean that incentives don't work.  they just don't work at that level.  he does mention the phrase ""extrinsic vs intrinsic motivators"" a couple times but doesn't go into any detail about what that means.<p>what I'd take from this is something that marketers have known for years: you can get people to insane things (like build an encyclopedia for free) by appealing to their inbuilt biases.  as it turns out these biases are a bit more subtle than ""money good, me work faster"", but again, marketers already know this.",1251293123

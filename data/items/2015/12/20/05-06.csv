There seems to be a sweeping majority of Singularity believers that just take &quot;AGI in 30-50 years&quot; as just an obvious inevitability.  So therefore we just go straight into SciFi mode and make all kinds of speculation with that premise. Then, this couples with this sort of, I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, maybe its like an uncritically overly anti-establishment or &quot;naively disruptive&quot; current that just collectively nods like &quot;Oh yeah, the traditional law firm is dead meat.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s surprising to m,e as I believe the community is largely made up of technologists, that I never see much questioning the fundamental claims here.<p>For that wet dream of that Internet Bayes Theorem Religion, that I will not name, to come true, it needs to first be possible and second, there must br credible, serious people to actually be working on it. Granted, artificial intelligence is a very hot area of research. However, for anyone that is either a researcher in this field, a graduate student in the field, or just someone actually very current on the latest papers and the current research programs, knows this is AGI of the SciFi sort is not really what is being worked on.<p>Not to go into all of the field but sure there are many interesting things happening in pattern recognition, NLP, machine learning and data mining and much work done with things like convolusional neural networks ..... but I&#x27;m sorry to say that these an AGI Overlord do not make. They are fancy techniques that yield very powerful and interesting results but in consideration of an AGI they are rather boring and banal.<p>Largely, the techniques have been discontinuous incremental improvements on reasonably simple ideas from the 1950s and 1960 but now utilizing massive parallelism. Unfortunately, I think, for AGI a non-trivial number of techniques are rooted in statistical and probabilistic methods, which I think anyone would agree is probably a a wrong track toward intuitive and creative problem solving.<p>It&#x27;s not that those of us critical of AGI proclamations think that it is impossible, that would be rather bold, or that we think humans are magical or something. We probably just think that our brains, or even abstractly &quot;true intelligence&quot;, are things that are unlikely able to be simulated by something like a Turing Machine. Any skeptic knows that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. And I gotta tell ya, the way facial recognition works or even Watson, ain&#x27;t it.<p>Also, I will say, just because something in the world is a certain way or if it is not exactly like Uber, does not mean it is necessarily a bad thing .... I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27; ....<p>An AGI Overlord would probably not be like the wild-eyed disruptor but more contemplative and understanding of the world as being very complex.",1450591022

10766197,comment,10765562,10766098,0,0,srunni,,,"My biggest concern with Theranos, which I haven&#x27;t really seen acknowledged in any of these articles, is that multiparametric panels on asymptomatic individuals will lead to a proliferation of false positives. Running hundreds of tests whenever a patient decides to do so doesn&#x27;t make sense unless that ultimately enables better clinical outcomes for patients. And this is true regardless of whether the underlying measurement technology that Theranos has developed actually works or not.<p>It&#x27;s discussed in a journal article from earlier this year by a pathologist:<p>> panel profiling, which was introduced in the 1970s as a way of identifying early biochemical changes of disease in asymptomatic individuals, had been abandoned in the 1980s, not so much for the cost. It has long been realized that with multiparametric testing, approximately 5% of results will be false positives, i.e., test results outside the reference intervals, in otherwise normal subjects. This is due to the definition of reference intervals, as being values between the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile of a reference (normal) population. The high cost of investigating seemingly abnormal results in normal people, and the added anxiety of patients, has led to the complete replacement of such biochemical profiling with what is now known as “discrete testing”. In the latter, tests are performed by the testing laboratory, only if requested specifically by the physician.<p><a href=""http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/cclm.2015.53.issue-7/cclm-2015-0356/cclm-2015-0356.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/cclm.2015.53.issue-7/cclm-20...</a>",1450590675

10766186,comment,10764605,10765157,0,0,mwfunk,,,"There was a period of time in the &#x27;80s when it was widely assumed by the software cognescenti that microkernels were the future. A lot of companies were experimenting with them. A lot of these experimental OSes were based on Mach. GNU Hurd has always been based on Mach. This makes sense because it began development in 1990, and at the time that might&#x27;ve seemed like both a forward thinking and sensible thing to do.<p>NeXTStep was based on a Mach+BSD kernel, which at the time would&#x27;ve been an obvious thing to do if your goal was to create a modernized Unix system with all the latest cutting-edge (in the mid-80s!) technologies available.<p>That kernel lives on in OS X and its descendants. It was always built as a monolithic kernel, AFAIK. It just differed from a traditional BSD kernel in that the lowest layers (VM, process, thread, and scheduler stuff) were replaced by the Mach microkernel. I believe that this kind of monolithic Mach+BSD arrangement was a pretty common thing to do when developing a Mach-based Unix implementation.<p>From the outside it&#x27;s almost indistinguishable from a BSD kernel. So why not just use an ordinary BSD kernel? Because it future-proofs the design. It gives you an easy path to gradually moving kernel-space services out of the core kernel and into separate address spaces, as microkernel technology improves and it becomes practical to do so. Of course, that never really happened, but it was a very logical choice at the time.<p>There were other benefits to Mach- you also got multithreading (this was a big deal, mid-80s remember), as well as Mach IPC. Mach IPC has its pros and cons, but just being able to have user and kernel services communicate via arbitrarily defined protocols rather than having to constantly add new system calls is very convenient.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much it. This system has been around for > 30 years now, and even though it never turned into a true microkernel system, there probably was never much of a reason to de-Machify it either. It would be a ton of work and you wouldn&#x27;t gain anything. It&#x27;s not that Mach is so awesome (although it has some niceties), it&#x27;s more that there&#x27;s a lot of momentum there, and you wouldn&#x27;t really gain anything by rewriting all that code.<p>As for why Linux distributions don&#x27;t use it, the same reasons apply. It&#x27;d be too much work for relatively little benefit. It made sense to base your cutting edge kernel on Mach in 1985, not so much 30 years later. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for OS X to stop using it for the reasons given above, but it also doesn&#x27;t make much sense for anyone who isn&#x27;t already using it to base new stuff on top of it today.",1450590230

My two favorite languages are Standard ML and Haskell, which I have found very well suited to the way I think: denotationally (expressions are given meaning by a mapping to a semantic domain), algebraically (substituting variables for expressions), abstractly (selectively ignoring implementation specifics) and structurally (the only operations allowed on an expression are those sanctioned by its type).<p>However, I don&#x27;t think Scala supports your argument very well.

If a fingerprick blood test were actually possible it would make a huge win for children. One of my kids needs to get his blood tested for lead ( standard blood test for his age). Good luck trying to get him to hold still while he&#x27;s screaming and fighting and drawing enough blood for a test. It would also be a huge win for premature babies, some of which only have 2oz of blood in their entire system.<p>The sell of Theranos was that you could do a thousand blood tests on a few drops of blood. If you could go to Safeway and get an accurate fingerprick blood test, then you wouldn&#x27;t need a trained specialist to draw blood and collect the blood samples anymore.

Epic, Cerner, GE, Dairyland, OpenVista, and the 180 other people who make electronic medical/health record software all have proprietary file formats and standards.  The systems can't talk to each other, and there's a ginormous industry in jury-rigging protocols to make them semi-sorta work.  It's a joke.<p>Of course, in the only place where we've had a standard, we've seen massive innovation in technology.  Radiology's  DICOM standard is, to me, the single reason why we've gone so far so fast.  Because everything is portable, vendors actually have to innovate rather than relying on lock-in.<p>If Obama wants to save lives through EMR, he's going to have to dictate a file format standard.

As a rough back-of-the-envelope figure, at 11 cents a kilowatt-hour running one watt for a year costs a dollar -- so if it sucks 80 watts sitting their with no monitor (a reasonable figure) that's $80 bucks a year, if you are paying more than 11 cents it is correspondingly more.<p>You can never have too many backups, and in my experience having the data on a complete separate machine is more reliable and easier to recover from than USB disks or other schemes.

The industry was not ""decimated"" by file sharing, they were <i>surprised</i> and <i>pissed off</i> by it.  iTunes didn't succeed because it convinced people to pay for music--it succeeded because it was the nicest way to do so.  It's not magic, it's not mystery, it's just building something that doesn't suck. Old media companies still have trouble with that concept.  Exhibit A: ""Already an NYTimes.com member?

No CI recipe has ever failed me; most document in meticulous detail why each choice was made.<p>Second, Cooks Illustrated may have the same editorial policy as Consumer Reports, but it's really <i>not</i> the Consumer Reports of food. 80% of their content is original research on recipes and techniques. At the end of each issue, they have 2 ""Consumer Reports""-like sections, one on a piece of equipment and one on an ingredient. But that's a feature, not the engine.<p>Third, in fairness, CI has other revenue streams: a lucrative line of cookbooks (several new ones are issued every year, and their flagship cookbook also goes through many editions) and 2 popular PBS television shows, which PBS stations pay them to run.

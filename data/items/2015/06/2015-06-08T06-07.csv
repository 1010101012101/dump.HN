9677585,comment,9674606,9674606,0,0,zaroth,,,"Personally I know that college was a complete waste of time for me. I gained very few skills in the classroom I would not have picked up myself, and have zero need for the credential. Sure, I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting the $100k I spent back. But it was a choice I made based on the information I had at the time.<p>I also am pretty certain that from a macro standpoint it&#x27;s obvious that American universities are doing <i>something</i> very right. I hear the frustration in many of these comments and the desire to rant, but hyperbole doesn&#x27;t really make for interesting discussion. American universities and colleges are not universally bad, they do in many cases actually succeed in providing a valuable education, 99% of the population does not in fact accumulate tremendous debt simply to get a college degree, etc.<p>As for student debt in general, I personally think of it as just another variable tax rate on the middle class. The middle class is absolutely strangled by progressive taxes, and FAFSA is just another cog in the machine to claim $0.95 of every dollar you earn from $30k to about $120k of MAGI.<p>What is the solution? Who is John Galt? In many cases the correct answer is to just stop earning regular taxable income beyond about ~$30k MAGI. Suddenly your health care is free, your groceries are free, your kids college education is free, and your tax rate is negative (Treasury sends <i>you</i> the checks) and you certainly won&#x27;t be servicing that old student loan either. I&#x27;m not saying to stop contributing back to society, I&#x27;m just saying, consider stepping off that squeaky spinning wheel first.<p>Any progressive system, by definition, will have parts of the curve where marginal utility is reduced. Some people (apparently like the author of this op-ed) manage to step directly into the worst part of this curve, which at many points demand in excess of $1.00 for every incremental $1.00 you earn. Very few people have even a basic understanding of the tax code and social welfare programs of the U.S., so it&#x27;s impossible to expect people will make &quot;good choices&quot; under the current system. It&#x27;s unnatural for someone to realize that job they are working feels like it&#x27;s paying a wage, but over 10 years actually costs significantly more than it pays! This is all a result of the current system of which nondischargeable student debt plays just a small part.<p>The most annoying part of the article is that it appears the author actually found the solution, but just continued ranting like the solution didn&#x27;t exist, and didn&#x27;t bother explaining the actual mechanics of it so people might actually learn from it. It&#x27;s also worth pointing out the author is not a current student (not dealing with the current system which is much different) but living with loans from a past era. The part about mom co-signing the loan, for example, was a huge red flag.",1433746736

The trouble with this is that it&#x27;s expressed as a programmer&#x27;s approach; everything is about variables, not geometry.  Constraints should be input from a GUI, like Dreamweaver.  To see what this looks like done right, try sketch mode in Autodesk Inventor, where you can draw lines, circles, and arcs and constrain them to each other in various ways.

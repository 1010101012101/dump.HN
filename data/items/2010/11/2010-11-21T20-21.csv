At various moments in a single day you may be miserable, numb, and surprisingly cheerful. None of these is the wrong response, especially when the loss is so fresh. If you're still feeling perpetually distraught in two years, talk to a shrink. (Talk to a shrink now if you think it might be helpful, but don't do it because you think your response is somehow disproportionate or invalid. It isn't.)<p>(2) Get used to the fact that this event will place a layer of friction between you and most other people. Hopefully you have one or two people in your life who you have talked to, at length, about what you're going through. Others, even good friends, will regularly say things that feel callous and unsympathetic. Try to be patient with them.",1290373172

Sometimes entrepreneurs don't know when to quit on old efforts and re-focus the mission of their startups.

I'm just some lone nut-case who occasionally makes fantastical claims that most folks find unbelievable -- an issue I work very hard to keep out of my place of employment.<p>There is a difference though. You are probably in the top 1 percentile when it comes to intelligence and being able to  rationally research and figure out what it better for you.<p>But what about the other 99% ? They choose to lead a lifestyle that might in chronic and expensive (yet initially  completely preventable) diseases. Then they rely on emergency room treatment and in the end they end up costing everyone more time, money and energy.<p>U.S. already spends more on healthcare than West European countries that provide a public option and yet delivers worse care for the average of citizen. I don't know that what we have is because we don't provide a public option or because we _do_ provide any govt. sponsored health care. I strongly suspect it is the former, not the later.<p>Note, that if we didn't have a ""free"" emergency room treatment option + Medicare and Medicaid, the argument for a completely govt. ""hands-off"" approach would be stronger. Let everyone who could not achieve a certain financial prosperity just die off. They are unfit anyway. Eventually only the healthy and/or wealthy will remain. I think that would be very disturbing but I think there are segments of the population who would strongly support this.<p>However, now it turns out that the same people that are severely against govt. doctors telling them what to eat will run the the same govt. run hospital when they have a heart attack. And eventually everyone ends up worse off. The doctor's time is wasted, the patient is in critical condition and dying, everyone's money is wasted.<p>Perhaps in the end it comes down to education. I think the younger generation is brainwashed into believing certain things about independence, self-reliance, freedom, 
 and so on. But they are not educated to the level where they can function in such a self-reliant manner. I am not. I do not have the tools or the ability, for instance, to test every single piece of meat or produce that I buy in the store. Maybe I am being slowly poisoned. The same thing with medicine. I don't know enough to choose the best medication for me. If I had a serious condition, I doubt I would have  the knowledge to pick between prescription mediation A or B.<p>The point is that our cultural attitudes might actually be harming us as a nation. They are predicated on certain conditions that are just not true anymore. What used to be an advantage has become a disadvantage. And I think we either make the conditions true again (educate the hell out of everyone) or we should try to slowly change our attitudes.",1290370585

A thought I had for a while: do analysis on games as they occur and try to estimate opponents' strength, as a way to detect cheating of the type where one of the players mimics a computer. Computationally expensive, but would be fun to try.",1290369726

If this is true than the clustered or scale out solutions offered by IBM (SONAS), HP (IBRIX) and EMC (with the recent acquisition of Isilon) might be a suitable off the shelf solution matching your scenario (probably there are some open source solutions also that I am not aware of).<p>The way I understand these solutions you can basically scale capacity and performance independently which in turn translates itself in the flexibility of achieving the ideal balance between capacity and failure point distribution/redundancy.<p>What do you guys think of this setup? Would it achieve your goals?<p>I'm coming from a corporate environment where having an off the shelf solution that is supported by some major company is as important as the solution itself.",1290369707

This gives you a lot of opportunity to use pointers-to-pointers and so on.<p>It's a thing that can be nicely visualized on a whiteboard, and it has relevance for students to understand things like databases or filesystems.<p>If you care to elaborate, you could continue explaining the pitfalls of multithreading, or locking all or parts of the tree during updates, making updates visible in a atomic way... but that gets's out of your ""not too simple/crazy"" limit pretty fast.<p>You could also make up a nice producer/consumer example where parts of data that has to be processed is passed around by pointers, stored in linked lists, sliced up/combined.

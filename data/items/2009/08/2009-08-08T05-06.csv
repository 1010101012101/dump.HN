In 2003 the United States spent about $94 Billion Dollars on medical reseearch.  About 28% of this came from the National Institute of health.  Yes, you are technically correct, this makes them the largest ""single"" contributor.

Has burnt me a few times ... the reason is that they were ""borrowed"" from erlang, as much as possible - the idea being that pattens could be added to the match on an actor (after it is created), so any unmatched ""messages"" in the ""mailbox"" will just sit there in hope that one day a pattern will fit - which I can't imagine is a common thing to want to do in reality.",1249710391

It really isn't innovative - isn't lightweight, and isn't based on some ""killer app"" - its just made up of interesting ideas (perhaps too many?).<p>I certainly hope it doesn't reflect too much on scala.

That sounds fine to me (implementation bugs notwithstanding) and it's what the second FAQ (<a href=""http://www.jcryption.org/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jcryption.org/faq/</a>) says happens.<p>Of course, this is still an awful idea because, as other posts have pointed out, the library itself can be doctored in transit, but I don't see a problem with the key handling design.",1249709909

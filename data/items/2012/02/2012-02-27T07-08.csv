In French we actually have two distinct words: ""vgtarisme"" vs ""vgtalisme"" (which are both cases of ""vganisme"").<p>The former is concerned with cruelty and eating living animals, and is assumed to have no problem consuming milk and eggs. The latter is assumed to reject all forms of animal proteins, living exclusively on vegetal products.",1330329431

3638160,comment,3637706,3637985,5,0,furyofantares,,,"> The original definition is<p>There is a wide range of people that call themselves vegan.  Diets vary greatly, and the reasons for choosing those diets varies even more.  Some eat honey.  Some don't.  Some eat tons of junk food and don't care about health.  Some eat incredibly healthy and don't care about animals.  Some are guided by beliefs about the economy or about sutstainability.  Some eat animal products when they would otherwise be thrown away.  Some eat meat or other animal products on very rare occasions.  You may not want to call some of these people ""vegan"", or maybe they are the ones you aren't calling ""strict vegan"", but they probably get value out of calling themselves vegan because it's a convenient way to give someone an idea of what kinds of foods they wish to avoid.<p>There isn't a vegan authority, and people aren't reading some definition as a set of instructions, because being a vegan isn't the goal, at least for anyone I've met, it is a means to some goal.  The goals vary, and the dedication to those goals vary, which is there is a wide variety of diets.  If you limit who you want to call a ""strict vegan"" to people who read some definition and then follow it, where following the definition is the goal itself, then I think you're left with almost nobody.<p>I don't like to call myself ""a vegan"" largely because it facilitates the misconception I'm following rules rather than making choices.  It's not a religion or a personal trait, it's a dietary choice (for me, a lifestyle choice for others, who may minimize animal product use outside of their diet.)<p>People ask me if I can eat this or that, rather than do I eat it, will I eat it, or do I want to eat it, and they really seem to mean ""am I able to"" as if I might not be capable of eating meat, or as if there is some authority with power over me that will not allow it.  That's not the case.  I can eat meat and drink milk, of course.  I just don't want to.<p>There may be foods you don't want to eat as well.  But I probably can't predict how you would react to changes to those foods.  And you probably can't predict how I will react to lab-grown meat.  For that matter, I probably can't predict how I will react, either.",1330329084

And this is good: sacrificing a bit of extra time to learn a technology that will make you more efficient is usually a good trade because learning takes a constant amount of time while being more efficient is at least linear.<p>The real issue is with tools that are arbitrarily complex. The DOM is a great example: its poor API, browser inconsistencies, weird layout rules...etc do not help you, but are difficult to learn and use.

3638099,comment,3637894,3637894,7,0,nodemaker,,,"I think this way of laying out subviews is a functionally incomplete approach and it more often than not makes you write more code than it really abstracts.<p>To be honest this is in fact one reason most iOS developers dont like Android or Java Swing.Because what really happens is that you think of something really cool and then you realize that its not really linear or grid or rectangular or even box.At that point learning how to layout subviews with co-ordinates is too much work and you just go with a shitty box layout instead.This has happened to me so many times while using java swing that I am now (wrongly) biased against java for life.<p>For example what if I want to layout my subviews in a circular fashion around the centre of the parent view.Or what if my subviews are cards which are seperated from the previous card with exponentially increasing distances.<p>On iOS the simple way to layout subviews is by quite simply setting their frames relative to the frame of the parent view in the layoutSubviews method.To take care of different screen sizes and orientations all you have to do is the set the autoresizing mask correctly.Thats it!<p>That's like seven lines of code for three subviews and it is functionally complete.",1330326983

It's easy to imagine that the cost-cutting inhumanity of ranches includes poor nutrition.<p>Besides that, few people eat beef for its nutrition (beyond the protein), and McDonald's meat is probably more tuned for 1) ease of production and 2) taste than nutritional value.",1330326975

I tried hacking a macro wrapper for definition that saved the definition somewhere serializable but ... yuck.<p>Perhaps ClojureScript could be a good basis for this (once it's out of alpha and features reflection and whatnot)?  One could build a REPL-based development environment (_not_ an IDE!) that behaved somewhat like SLIME, and integrated with all the new hotness (GitHub, Heroku etc. etc.)<p>Mightn't need much in the way of new technology, so much as a whole lot of nice glue to hold it all together.",1330326848

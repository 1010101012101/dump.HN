Tom Duff has written a pretty good, clear case for ""single entry, multiple exit"" in the form of multiple conditional return statements in a function. And Rob Pike has made a pretty clear case that this:<p><pre><code>        for(i=0 to 100)
                array[i]=0;
</code></pre>
is better than this:<p><pre><code>        for(elementnumber=0 to 100)

But that involves variables named with 1 or 2 characters.<p>The rest I pretty much agree with, except in very unusual cases.",1248345546

719289,comment,718594,718730,0,0,chrismear,,,"If you're interested in these topics, I highly recommend a couple of books by philosopher Daniel Dennett: 'Consciousness Explained' and 'Freedom Evolves'.<p>His way of reconciling determinism with free will goes something like this. Assuming determinism, then we are living in one of a huge number of possible universes. As limited intelligences, we have no way of figuring out exactly which history we live in, and so no way of accurately predicting the future. That's the free will we have -- the ability to 'play the game' and participate in this deterministic world, using our limited knowledge to try and understand what's going on; and how we can affect it, within the rules of physics.<p>Yes, this means that we don't have total free will in an unlimited fantastical sense; and, from the point of view of an all-knowing being who knows which history is the real one, all our actions are predetermined. But for all practical purposes, our participation as information-seeking, decision-making agents embedded in this elaborate ball game gives you all of the usual qualities that we worry losing with the loss of 'real' free will -- culpability for our actions, for example.<p>Even if you're not convinced by Dennett's position, the books do give useful ways of thinking about these problems, and go a long way towards removing the baggage that has accumulated around concepts of 'free will', 'determinism', 'responsibility', 'consciousness' and so on, so that one can reason about these ideas with more pragmatism.",1248344721

719285,comment,719234,719267,0,0,JMostert,,,"Does that matter? Those users who <i>do</i> care should get the support they can expect if management claims to be committed to Windows, regardless of how many they are. It's a simple matter of putting your money where your mouth is: if you care, you make sure you have people who can support Windows and like to take responsibility to bring it up to par with the other platforms, otherwise you make it clear that Windows is a second-class citizen and you should be prepared to get a poorer-quality product with less support.<p>From a short-term management perspective it seems better to have just the promise of support than to have nothing at all, but in the long term you're sending a signal that MySQL on Windows isn't to be taken seriously, and that you don't want people who are committed to Windows as customers. That's as fine a business decision as any, but then it's cheaper to cut out Windows development altogether than to go about it halfheartedly.",1248344187

You see, as people buy LOLmagnetz, more money gets donated to our local SPCA, which can save more cats and dogs, only to have them get adopted and create more pet owners, who will naturally be inclined to... <i>buy LOLmagnetz</i>.<p>Ta-da!<p>Admittedly, this just arose from a desire to create interesting stuff people wanted (it's such a calculable way to know someone likes what you've created).  I suppose it's not far from the YC maxim.<p>We're in a lucky place because we don't need to do this to pay our own bills, so we can give it all away.  But this element came from my frustration with how stale fundraising has become for most non-profits.  People have become desensitized/jaded/bored by the typical plea of ""help X, give $Y."" Offering a product someone wants even without possibly knowing of the charitable implications (and I have anecdotal evidence to show that many don't know this about in our products) means a unique fundraising channel for the non-profits that benefit.<p>If I had my druthers, more people - especially nonprofits themselves - would copy not just our products (hehe) but also the model.<p>Oh, and as for caring for people, I am an avid believer in the great affect it has on business.

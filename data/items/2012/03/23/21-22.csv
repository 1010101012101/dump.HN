Whether the language evolves, or just the common insights of how to use it best.<p>In fact, C# deals <i>excellently</i> with legacy code. While, unlike the JVM, .NET is not binary backward compatible (allowing some excellent language improvements that Java still has not managed to pull off), it is <i>nearly</i> (but not entirely) source code backward compatible. Sure, this allows to old code using old constructs to stay alive, but it <i>works</i>. That alone is pretty unique, especially if you see that nearly any other language either does not manage to move its community to the next version with breaking changes (Python 3, PHP 6) or has tons of compatibility issues every time something changes (Ruby, Scala), or simply is at a standstill (Java).<p>Having to deal with a DictionaryBase child class which was made before generics were added is <i>way less</i> of a deal than not being able to upgrade your software to the newest version of the language at all. Which is what would've happened if this was done like Scala. Or, if it was done like Java, we'd still be hacking DictionaryBase child classes.<p>I'd maintain that no language/platform deals with legacy code better than C#.",1332539936

I don't want to be publicly committed to them by default; I want to make that choice myself and be aware that I'm making it, like posting on HN.

We don't really have anybody in research labs to do the kind of amazing full-time implementation, support, evangelism, and publication work that the Simons do so fabulously for Haskell!<p>That said, as a researcher, having many more SML users would require us (particularly Manticore) to Get Real in ways that are not on the path to publication.

You could use some sort of HMAC to encrypt a message that is based on the unique ID of the Ultralight tag. The reader could verify that the data on the tag is the encrypted message corresponding to that tag's ID. This is broken if anyone decides to clone a tag down to the serial ID. This would require custom tag fabrication or a misbehaving supplier.<p>- Ultralight C tags: 3DES encryption [skipping details] you could have better prevention of cloning the tag. Unfortunately, 3DES encryption is symmetric and if anyone can access the reader, they can remove the key and again clone a tag. (This is how HID Class RFID cards work except they don't use 3DES and there are at least 3 ways of easily retrieving the master key)<p>- SmartCard: Actual PKI with assymetric encryption so that someone can provide a challenge and the SmartCard can provide the proper response. Again, sadly, contactless cards and they're expensive.<p>Other than that, I'm out of ideas. I'm a tinkerer and a student.

Both languages have a clean, minimalist aesthetic, are rediculesly powerful, and very expressive.<p>When it comes to getting stuff done, Javascript is an interesting language, and there are some things about it I like a lot, but there are many things in it where a) there is syntax for things that make no sense (like the ~ operator), b) the syntax for something common and important is horribly clunky (like function, or assigning to a prototype), c) the syntax having odd rules that almost seem like little traps (like the way that () will call the previous line as a function, or how you need a trailing comma on everything in an object literal except for the last thing). All that being said, I love what I can do with it. And I really find that CSS/JS/Semantic HTML has some of the nicest seperation of concerns of any UI programming toolkit I have looked at.

Also, it looks like a random front page story is reranked regularly to ensure no items get ""stuck"" at the top if voting stops (rerank-random).\nThere's also a function (gen-topstories) to generate the rankings for the top 1000 stories, although I can't tell if this is being run regularly (it looks like it is just used to initialize the rankings).

C#'s biggest strength isn't the language. While the language is nice, there isn't a lot you can do with it in terms of productive development that you can't at least approximate in Java, especially with a good IDE to generate your boiler plate for you.<p>Where C# and .NET really shines is in its native integration and low level facilities. How many other tools in the world let you debug a mixed application containing both native and managed code, all in the same IDE and in the same session, with the ability to set breakpoints in either area, view values, do memory watch points, and so on?<p>It also feels so incredibly easy to call native code in C#. There's even a whole web site dedicated to making it easier, pinvoke.net!<p>Lastly, C# itself contains several performance-sensitive features that have no JVM equivalent, including value types,  unsigned integrals, and unsafe code with raw pointers. The .NET platform even has an implementation of tail recursion , now, though the C# compile will not generate IL that uses it, which makes it inaccessible for most people.<p>When it comes to language design, C# is a little sloppy but it more than gets the job done. In terms of tools and low-level facilities for building a real-world application, C# on the Windows .NET platform feels absolutely world-class.<p>For my favorite language, I of course, voted for Scala!",1332538051

One possible attack would be that this new TOS provision is unconscionable [1], and therefore unenforceable, to the extent it purported to give FB trademark rights beyond those provided by trademark law.<p>This argument might be supported by a longstanding public policy (at least in the U.S.):  Trademark law gives certain rights to trademark ""owners,"" not because they have some natural-right entitlement, but to protect the <i>public's</i> right not to be confused about the origin, sponsorship, or endorsement of the products and services they encounter in the marketplace [2].  A trademark owner can't enforce its trademark rights against another when there's no likelihood of confusion as to origin, sponsorship, or endorsement [3].<p>On the other hand, even if Facebook didn't prevail on a trademark <i>infringement</i> theory (requiring proof of a likelihood of confusion), it still might succeed in a lawsuit for <i>dilution</i> of a famous mark [4].  A court might view that as legitimizing the new FB TOS.<p>B.  There might also be an antitrust challenge:  By requiring users to agree not to use a term to which it (hypothetically) doesn't have trademark rights, Facebook might be guilty of an unlawful tie-out [5].<p>C.  Finally, if FB doesn't require users to click on ""I agree"" again, and doesn't even notify them that the new TOS are in effect, then courts are unlikely to enforce the new TOS.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit already ruled to that effect in one case [6].<p>It'll be interesting to see what comes of this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscionability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscionability</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark#Public_policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark#Public_policy</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm#7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_dilution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_dilution</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.dechert.com/library/Analyzing%20IP%20License%20-%20GGordon%205-02.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dechert.com/library/Analyzing%20IP%20License%20-%...</a> at p. 7<p>[6] <a href=""http://www.theiplawblog.com/archives/-cyberspace-law-ninth-circuit-holds-modified-terms-of-use-unenforceable-where-user-not-properly-notified-of-the-changes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theiplawblog.com/archives/-cyberspace-law-ninth-c...</a>",1332537709

It's used for software development, scripting, system administration and web development which seems to hit everything you want. I'd check out udacity's cs 101 which teaches how to build a search engine in Python as well as Google's Python class: <a href=""http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/</a><p>Since you're still in school it might be worthwhile to see if you could sneak into an intro to programming class for your last semester.",1332536626

Far too many sites seem to have been designed on OS X and not tested anywhere else, and it's an obnoxious, lazy, and frankly elitist practice that needs to end.<p>Another related syndrome are sites designed on professional-grade monitors, with no thought given to how they're going to look on the other 95% of screens. This kind of shit is like engineering a car in California and just assuming it will work well in February in Montreal.",1332536597

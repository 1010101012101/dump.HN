7514682,comment,7514357,7514357,4,0,acjohnson55,,,"In the grand scheme of things, our evidence that Brendan Eich is a raging homophobe comes down to one 6 year old donation of $1000. Not a pattern of actions at work, but one political action.<p>I support gay marriage today, but a decade ago, I didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m a bit ashamed to admit that. It took a lot of time and a lot of incremental phases for me to come around from someone who was openly opposed, to someone who tolerated, and finally fairly recently to someone who actively supports gay relationships and marriage. I&#x27;m still working on trying to bring my parents around to my point of view. They espouse viewpoints I frankly find offensive today and I can nearly guarantee that in the past they&#x27;ve donated more than $1000 to organizations that oppose gay marriage. But I by no means think they&#x27;re &quot;bad people&quot;. Eich is of my parents&#x27; generation, and I believe that empathy will eventually win most of them over, not ultimatums.<p>To me, Mozilla has become an unfair target of convenience. A lot of people are understandably still upset about Prop 8 and similar movements. But I think people have chosen to open fire at Mozilla simply because it&#x27;s a lot harder to try to engage marriage equality opponents directly as people in a public way.<p>Clearly, it has worked to put the issue out in front, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair or ultimately productive. What&#x27;s the endgame here? We can let the siege continue against Mozilla, one of the few major players who really stands behind the user. Maybe Eich will step down, and who knows what happens to Mozilla. Maybe we&#x27;ll get an insincere change of heart. But that&#x27;s just a victory for mob intimidation. I suppose maybe just maybe we&#x27;ll get a sincere reversal from Eich. He certainly seems sensitive to the pain he&#x27;s caused. But even if this happens, I don&#x27;t know that the end would justify the means.",1396435804

They do not have a moral right to enforce discrimination against consenting adults that are doing no harm to others. They enforce their position through the force of state, like Iran does when they execute their gays, but that does not make it right.<p>I&#x27;d rather our government wasn&#x27;t in the business of granting special rights to couples that decide to cohabitate. But since they are, I expect it to be equally available to all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation.<p>> How about things that other societies have abolished already, like the death penalty or the world&#x27;s biggest incarceration rate (predominantly on blacks)?<p>I&#x27;m against both of those things as well. I&#x27;m also against the drug war, the massive income inequality gap, software patents, trade law that is allowed when it benefits corporations (outsourcing) and artificially restricted (via DMCA) when it doesn&#x27;t (importing and region coding), and many, many other things.<p>I personally feel more strongly about the rights of same-sex couples to marry than I do about not executing a convicted murderer (especially once you adjust for how many are affected by each issue), but I would certainly consider it a negative if Eich were to come out in support of capital punishment.<p>I think a whole lot more people would be upset if Eich donated to maintaining the disproportionate incarceration rate in place on African Americans.<p>...<p>Does everything have to devolve into slippery slopes?

He made a public statement (money as speech), and now the community can (and will) hold him accountable for it.<p>The bottom line is -- being homophobic is starting to reach the same point in popular culture as racism and sexism.  Our society as a whole is becoming far less tolerant of such nonsense, being against gay marriage is treated like being against interracial marriage.  Even 61% of young Republican leaning 18-29 year olds are in favor of marriage equality.<p>It follows a similar trend to interracial marriage (slow start, then a rapid increase in acceptance).  In 1986, less than 35% of American&#x27;s &quot;approved&quot; of interracial marriage.  A mere 5 years later, the number was about 50% .. and 20 years later that vast majority approve of interracial marriage, with more than 30% having a family member involved in an interracial relationship.<p>That is when it hits home for people, when a friend of family member comes out (today, being in love with the same sex... in the 80s, being in love with another race) -- it becomes personal, and when it becomes personal, you can no longer abstract &#x27;those&#x27; people -- now it is your friend, your sister, your cousin, the best man at your wedding, etc.<p>You can rail against marriage being crap (it is, I agree) -- but that isn&#x27;t the point.  If you are against marriage, I am with you 100% -- lets get rid of it as a government regulated institution!  But, if it is around, it has to be an option for all.  I think it is far too close to religion to be certified by government, but that ship has sailed long ago... gotta work within reality.<p>Also, undemocratic to demonize one side of the vote, are you kidding?  That is the oldest democratic tradition!<p>As for why it gets more &quot;marketing&quot; than the death penalty and gun control.  It gets more &quot;marketing&quot; than the death penalty because it touches more peoples lives.  It gets FAR less &quot;marketing&quot; than gun control, gun control just has lots of marketing on both sides, a massive constitutional question, and is not trending towards consensus... marriage equality unequivocally is trending towards consensus... it will be a decided issue before it ever has the &quot;marketing&quot; of gun control.<p>While I am freaking ranting... this quote is idiocy &quot;Beliefs that are protected, that include political and religious speech, are generally not something that can be held against even a CEO.&quot; -- NO.  Just NO.  If you believe something that society finds laughable or horrible (Lizard people run the world, X race is superior, Z are bad at math, the Holocaust didn&#x27;t happen, etc)... and you support it out loud, with money, in public.  Of COURSE it can be held against you -- you don&#x27;t have a goddamn right to that job, and part of your job is to be the face of the company.<p>/rant",1396435232

Now I remember that I have seen this before and feel the need to warn you (Americans) about what (could) be coming out of this: The GPPD-spiral.<p>The German-Pirate-Party-Death-spiral.<p>Many of you might have heared about the Pirate Party, and probably some remeber that, curiously, it was rather successful in Germany. Starting 2009, the number of party members rose (beyond 10.000) and the party started winning seats in regional parliaments. At the time, it was primarily focused on its technology/freedom agenda.<p>Then something weird happened. As the party tried to expand its programatic range beyond technology, many very controversial topics were voted into the program (base-income, de-criminalization of drugs, removal of the incest paragraph).<p>Discussions became very heated between those that wanted the party to firmly anchor itself in the &quot;left&quot; of the political spectrum, and those opposed to such a move.<p>And then they started attacking the elected representatives. Every publically visible person who had done or said something problematic in the past was publically &quot;shitstormed&quot;. The half-life of party leaders sank down to months. This caused what is essentially the slow death of the party, since, for much of the time, there were too few people with experience at the top, too few the press could speak too.<p>Americans are more vulnerable to this kind of behaviour, since the separation between professional role and personal acts/views that we have in Europe is missing.<p>French presidents have had mistresses, left their wives, German chancellors have had three failed marriages, or a childless marriage. We had an openly gay foreign minister and ministers who refused to say &quot;god&quot; in their swearing in ceremony.<p>Top American politicians are always married with children church-going Christians, because the populace will not support &quot;personal weaknesses&quot;.<p>No separation between person and office.<p>The internet is the ultimate shitstorm-accelerator. If there is no barrier between the private life and the professional life of highly-exposed figures, they will fall like flies.<p>I&#x27;m personally an ardent supporter of gay rights issues, but must say that in this case, the collateral damage could well be as bad as in the first cases in the German Pirate Party.<p>Now all the Mozilla employees who want to rise through the ranks must have personal views that conform to public opinion in the USA. I&#x27;m strictly anti-gun, so I probably would be &quot;shot down&quot; at some point, were I a leading Mozilla figure.<p>And don&#x27;t think this will stop if Eich just goes away.<p>Let&#x27;s all hope that Linus or one of the other (unlike Eich) really important community leaders doesn&#x27;t have controversial views.",1396434923

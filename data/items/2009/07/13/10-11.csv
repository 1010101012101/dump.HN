In theory someone can provide an XML schema which defines the rules for the XML serialization of HTML5, but parsing HTML5 as HTML isn't something which (so far as I know) can be expressed in a standard machine-readable schema format.<p>The downside is you don't have ""drop this file into an SGML parser and it works"".

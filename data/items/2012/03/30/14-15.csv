So, the challenge with facebook is not getting people on their website but to put ads which are more relevant, so tht they can increase the average revenue per \nuser.<p>The question is how can facebook do it? Their algorithms can not change overnight that can make ppl click on them. another way to put it is with 800 million ppl on facebook and a large number of daily users why is that their revenue has not been able to catch up with google's, nd will it do anytime soon?",1333119591

3776188,comment,3775743,3775743,15,0,uvdiv,,,"Unfortunately The Paper [1] is closed source. I can't find much information; no comparison with existing, chemical synfuels processes (like methanol via syngas [CO]).<p>There's a serious problem with the general idea: ""clean"" CO2 is hard to get. You can get concentrated (>10%) CO2 streams from a power plant, which could work for synfuels, but ultimately that's still transferring fossil carbon into the air (if more efficiently). The ""nice"" idea is to capture CO2 from the atmosphere (I think they are implying this?); this gives you a carbon-neutral cycle (CO2 => fuel => CO2). This is difficult because CO2 in the air is so dilute -- 0.04% vol., or 0.8 grams/meter^3.<p>Can you get CO2 from the air? There's research in this; the APS assessment [2] thinks it could be done at around $600-800/tCO2, which translates to e.g. $7/gallon gas equivalent of methanol, just for the carbon. The process uses an inorganic base (NaOH) to scrub CO2, so maybe you'd think  you could genetically-engineer superbacteria to do better. But the absorbent is not the bottleneck -- it's the extreme volume and flow of air that needs to be brought <i>to</i> the absorbent, over an insanely large surface area. The scale is visualized in [2] figure 1.2 (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Y0D2f.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/Y0D2f.png</a>): a very small, 10^6 ton CO2/year capture plant is designed as a 1km * 1km grid of rows of giant, sucking fans. And the NaOH process isn't particularly inefficient -- it captures 50% of the CO2 in air.<p>Some more about atmosperic CO2 capture from David Keith [3] and his startup [4]; this was featured in the <i>Economist</i> this month [5]. Wikipedia is a starting point for synfuels in general [6]; George Olah advocates a methanol/dimethyl ether economy using CO2 recycled from air [7].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6076/1596.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6076/1596.abstract</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.aps.org/about/pressreleases/dac11.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aps.org/about/pressreleases/dac11.cfm</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.keith.seas.harvard.edu/AirCapture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.keith.seas.harvard.edu/AirCapture.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.carbonengineering.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.carbonengineering.com/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21550241"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/21550241</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_fuel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_fuel</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://wiki.ornl.gov/sites/carboncapture/Shared%20Documents/Background%20Materials/Alternative%20Methods/G.%20Olah.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ornl.gov/sites/carboncapture/Shared%20Documents/...</a>",1333119220

He then rejects the fact that Objective-C on OS X has had garbage collection for years because 'it is not a no-brainer because not every developer uses it' and because iOS doesn't support it. Guess what, ARC is now the default way of 'managing' memory on iOS and OS X, and it has some very clear advantages over garbage collection.

The problem is, there is a chance that this subtle change in perspective will evolve into an unhealthy culture.<p>Especially since this is coming from Yehuda Katz.  I've seen several people using things like Gun.io to fund patches and small additions to open source libraries, but it always seems to come from people you never see in the community - outsourcers, or people who just aren't that into coding but still code.  But once a leader in the community does this...  It's up in the air what this will do long term.<p>Here's one possible outcome.  It becomes ""cool"" to crowd fund open source projects, so a few of the up-and-coming coders with new open source projects start doing this too.  In a year or two, a big chunk of the top coders are charging to do open source work.  It's a badge of worthiness...  Coderwall.com get's it's ""$25k+ achievement"" badge.<p>Then one of two things can happen.  The unlikely thing is, it evens out, there's a happy balance - some people charge, some people don't.  Much more likely is people either start charging ridiculous amounts, the quality of free open source projects drastically decreases, or people start keeping their projects to themselves. This eventually leads to rebellion, and the true ones left start ANOTHER Free Software Foundation that gets back to the roots.<p>This kind of stuff happens, out of seemingly innocent and well-intentioned moves.<p>Like everyone's said, companies like 37signals and all the companies we work at fund open source projects, so one way or another we're getting some sort of payment.  It's totally cool to make money off your open source work like this, nobody really sees it even though we all know. It's this indirectness that keeps the community healthy.  It creates a feeling of open-ness.  A culture.  Asking for money directly like this doesn't make things feel open anymore, and like everything it will spiral.",1333118408

The ""warm body"" that does indeed just sell hours, usually via a labour broker or development house.  They fulfil a ""development resource"" capacity required on the project, and typically there is already a project structure (plan(s), schedule(s) and management) in place.  They are not directly responsible for the deliverables of the project.  I am a warm body contractor because (2) freaks me out.<p>2.  The ""development house"" (can just be one person despite the term) who initiates and manages the project in addition to doing the work.  They have to define the project, agreeing on scope, timeline and budget because they are party to a contract and are directly responsible for the deliverables.  If they screw any of these parts up (and that includes due diligence, e.g. can the client actually pay them, and how can you answer that question if you have no idea and agreement on project duration?!), their business stands to suffer losses.  This has nothing to do with predicting success -- it has to do with contractual obligations and legal liability.  They get to charge higher rates than (1) because of this additional skill required, risks involved and the associated differences in supply.<p>If you are a non-technical entrepreneur with no idea how to run technical projects and you seek out a warm body, you will get burned because that is not what you need (and this is part of what the linked article is about).<p>If you are a warm body who accepts such work - just selling hours and not a plan, a schedule and budget, yes I believe you are unethical because you are not ultimately providing what somebody expects, despite knowing their expectations, and that's the definition of misrepresentation (it's like selling somebody a car without a working engine and not stating that anywhere).<p>If you explain to them the risks, give them a plan that you honestly believe you can meet, and they still want to go ahead, <i>shrug</i> that's fine.

But these books are mostly not all that cheap just because they're in the public domain. And, presumably, the number of different titles still being read from that era is relatively small. And the top n% (where n is a small number) most popular titles from any era are mostly still in print, whether they're out of copyright or not.<p>Now, on the other hand, if this includes e-books, there's a pretty simple explanation. Many of the pre-copyright titles are available for free and very low cost and most of us with Kindles and Kindle apps have downloaded quite a few even if we haven't gotten around to reading all of them.<p>(I'm not arguing against shorter copyright terms by the way.

They see the final product, and everything beyond that is a black box to them.<p>So, everything a print publisher does leads to one final resting place: rasterization on paper. When you decide to make the jump to an electronic platform, the point in the process you diverge dictates the expense. The choice, from the publisher's perspective, is to:<p>A) Hand off their layout to this tool that Adobe provides and be done with it<p>B) Create some custom toolchain and process that converts the content to a better format<p>Keep in mind that option B is completely opaque to many of them. The commercial printing process has been around a long, long time, and for many of the managers that work in the publishing industry, the process is as intuitive as riding a bike. They don't even think about it. This means that choosing option B is more than just changing what they do, it's changing <i>who</i> does it. This means hiring more help, which is expensive.<p>Then there's the distribution problem. Many publishers don't handle their own distribution, and publishing each title as an individual app isn't a desirable option either. Choosing option A, or something like Zinio (also image based), means not solving ""yet another hard problem"".<p>Many publishers are in survival mode. The publisher I work with is fortunate to be so small. They had some early success with web-based products that returned huge margins, so the management decided that putting resources there made sense. Their staff have attacked the electronic-publishing learning curve and are coming around. I suspect that for many large publishers, the shift in direction won't happen. Their momentum is too great, it may ultimately lead to their demise.",1333117146

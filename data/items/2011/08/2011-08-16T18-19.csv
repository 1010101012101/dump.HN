Is Android selling because it is the best OS? or because it is currently seen as the 'other' OS? if more devices come with WP7 installed, with more shelf space dedicated to WP7 vs. Android, is there any reason why WP7 couldn't take the same position as Android?<p>The WP7 marketplace is growing quickly, the OS is solid and beautiful, and there is a lot of 'interest' at the moment. That 'interest' may not turn into sales, but handset manufacturers considering WP over Android could make a huge difference.",1313521146

2892392,comment,2891654,2891977,3,0,nkurz,,,"You are much kinder to the original post than I think is warranted.  I'd go so far as to say ""the author fundamentally misunderstands the concept of rainbow tables"".  I don't want to pick on him unduly: it can be much better to write something clear and wrong and have it corrected than to persist in fuzzy thinking.  But let's not waffle: this piece is clear and wrong.<p>As you point out, rainbow tables are fundamentally about chains of hashes, and about saving only the entry points into those chains. One would never save every entry, and if one did it would not be a rainbow table.  It's an arbitrary time-storage tradeoff, and faster GPU's simply change the ""sweet spot"".  The limit is not the storage space, but remains the amount of time you are willing to spend pre-computing, and GPU's give you much greater leverage here.<p>I tried to look through the article and find some positive pieces to point out, but I couldn't do it.  He the conflates floating point performance with hash speed, asserts that one needs to scan the full rainbow table from disk to use it, and concludes that rainbow tables are limited to 4 character passwords.  The general conclusion is correct (worry about brute force attacks) but there are so many other large errors that I cringe in fear.<p>Author (should you read this):  I don't mean be impolite, and I don't understand these issues well enough myself to try to teach them, but I truly am scared by your apparent fluency with these concepts combined with the level of inaccuracy.  Please do what you can to keep educating yourself about these concepts before applying them professionally.",1313520747

Why? Because the feds guarantee loans for kids attending. That is, the person directly paying is not the person receiving the benefit. In fact, for many people the goal is to have the feds completely pay for education using loans, thereby giving everybody the chance to make an easy trade: take on some debt which you will have to pay many decades from now, and in return you get a few years of attending a super cool school, learning incredible stuff, and making new friends.<p>Except, you can never default on these loans. Once you make them, you are stuck with them for life. And those things you choose to study? Many of those will never offer you the chance to make the money you need to pay the loans back.<p>So now you're out of college with a degree that doesn't offer the income potential you need to pay for all those loans you signed for.<p>So how is this any different from indentured servitude? It's not to a particular person, but to society at large. We give you a piece of paper, you sign it, you have fun and work hard for a few years, and then you're in such bad financial straits that you'll have to take anything you can find that makes money in a sad attempt to ever get even again. How many PhDs are waiting tables in college towns? Does this appear to be a functional system achieving necessary societal goals?<p>There's a big discussion over whether college is necessary. No clear answers there. But there is also a discussion over whether the money trades that we make as a society are actually doing any good. We keep paying more and more, getting lots of good folks in debt, and when we ask if college is supposed to help them pay these loans back, we get a speech about how college is a special time in a person's life and shouldn't be related directly to money. It seems fine to relate it directly to money when the kid is signing his life away for a vague promise, but when we ask where the payoff is we're told we're being crass. It's about more than money. It's about the experience.<p>That might be true, but there are a lot of special times in a person's life. Why are we letting people trade a few good years when they're young in order to limit their options for decades afterwards? Where's the sense in that, not to the person involved necessarily, but to the rest of us?",1313520156

I don't use splits, but I do occasionally use `screen -x` to have multiple views of the same screen session.<p>My biggest use of screen is for running a persistent Irssi session on my server, and connecting to that from whatever terminal or mobile device I happen to be sitting in front of.  In that case, I have just a couple active windows, but only one that I use 95% of the time.<p>I have a similar persistent screen session on my work machine for running Irssi's SILC client to chat with co-workers.<p>I also use screen for my primary workflow, because a lot of my development takes place on servers.  I'll start a screen session on each server, and create a new window for each type of task I'm performing.  Eg, I have a window each for `htop`, mongodb console, vim, git, and for running the program I'm working on, plus a few others for one-off tasks like installing a new package or editing a system configuration file.<p>Some tips I have include:<p>- Set up a nice .screenrc file, and make yourself a customized ""caption"" line, which will give you a status bar of sorts that will list all your open windows.  Mine is `caption always ""%{= dd}%{+b ky}%{+ .b} $LOGNAME@%H %{-} %{.y}%-w%50>%{+ Kg} %n %t %{-}%+w%<%{-}""`<p>- Similary, either get in the habit of naming your windows, or set up your shell to properly report commands to screen so it can automatically name them based on the command you've run.  My zshell config does this for both screen and gnome-terminal: <a href=""https://github.com/jreese/oh-my-zsh/blob/jreese/custom/screen-titles.zsh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jreese/oh-my-zsh/blob/jreese/custom/scree...</a><p>- Ctrl-a, Ctrl-a is a great combination for ""alt-tabbing"" between windows<p>- I set my least-used window to #0, as it's the ""hardest"" number to hit after ctrl-a, and I put my most used windows between #1 and #5 for easy one-handed switching.<p>- Ctrl-a Escape is the easiest way to get into copy mode to view your scrollback buffer.  Ctrl-a [ is equivalent, but IMO using escape instead allows me to start moving my right hand to the cursor/paging keys while I'm still using my left hand to enter copy mode.",1313519567

I've also been toying around with the development environment and find it just as nice.  Creating apps are super easy.<p>With Google's purchase, they are now directly competing with some of their Android partners, which should prove interesting.  I can see MS courting some of the companies and potentially drawing some away from Android.  No company likes to be completely beholden to one provider, and the option of WP7 <i>may</i> prove alluring enough.<p>Nokia is switching over to WP7 too.  While Nokia has been sliding downhill for a while now, the switch should help drive adoption.  MS may pull a Google and just outright buy Nokia too.",1313517608

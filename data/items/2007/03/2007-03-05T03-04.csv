Just for starters I was already in my mid-20s when I got my PhD.<p>A good friend of mine sold his startup last year to AOL for enough money that he'll never have to work again.  He was 41 at the time and I believe his co-founder was around the same age.  This gives me hope that I'm not quite over the hill yet ;-)",1173066857

But the users of the phpBB software consistently leave in the unnecessary junk.<p>All in all, he accurately articulated a wider design laziness which can even be seen in commercial sites (opera.com vs. mozilla.com or reddit vs. news.ycombinator). I know that this parenthetical suggestion will get me modded down, but where's the line between copying a proven good idea and unwillingness to take a risk on an original design?",1173066363

2265,comment,2260,2261,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""In my opinion, startup founders hit mid life crisis in their early 20s.""<p>I'd agree with that.  I'm 25 and sometimes wonder if I'm over the hill.<p>Then again, my boss in my day job (sole founder and CEO) is almost 50.  So it's not *impossible* to start late.  I have noticed that it makes things difficult, culture-wise.  The startup I'm at has a very 9-5 culture and tends to move fairly slowly, which is frustrating for young, ambitious hires like myself.  It does have customers and manages to turn a profit, but I worry that we're falling behind the technology curve and may find ourselves without customers if a major market shake-out occurs or a competitor invades.",1173065555
2264,comment,2260,2263,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Paul, is the YC demographic a good representative of the average startup founder's age? Judging from your articles, I sense that there is a certain, though justified, bias towards funding younger startup founders. This is the excerpt I am referring to:<p>""The other reason it's hard to start a company before 23 is that people won't take you seriously. VCs won't trust you, and will try to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding. Customers will worry you're going to flake out and leave them stranded. Even you yourself, unless you're very unusual, will feel your age to some degree; you'll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much older than you, and if you're 21, hiring only people younger rather limits your options."" - How to start a Startup",1173065426

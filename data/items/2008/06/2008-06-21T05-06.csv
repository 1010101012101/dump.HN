223508,comment,223240,223425,0,0,webwright,,,"Strangely, I think a lot of funded startups are more realistic about the challenges involved.  It's well documented.  We read about flameouts every day.<p>All of the bootstrapped businesses that get 6 months into their business and realize it's a much longer road just sorta fade away.  We don't hear much about 'em, don't read about 'em...  But a lot of people have latched onto the (very inspiring) story of 37s and a few other bootstrap stars.  Good on 'em.<p>The volume of people chasing the (more realistic) 37s-style dream is high, but I've been struck by the unreasoned optimism-- not the ""we can build something really good"" optimism (which is required, I think) but the ""we'll be rolling in money within 6 months"".  Thus the post!<p>Regarding abridging my post to say ""focus on profit earlier"" - nope.  I don't think I'd go back and go that route, even if I could...  But that's probably another post.",1214027781

223501,comment,222607,223471,0,0,timr,,,"I <i>did</i> answer your question, but now you're asking a different one.  I have no idea how ""important"" protein structure prediction will ultimately become; I just know that it's currently pretty useless, and getting worse.<p>My first comment was that compiler optimization is about a thousand times more <i>useful</i> than protein folding.  I stand by that remark.  However, at the beginning of my long answer, I mistakenly wrote that protein structure prediction is not important, when I had meant to write that it is not <i>useful:</i> protein folding is an <i>important</i> biological process, but protein structure prediction is not particularly <i>useful</i>, for the reasons I've mentioned.<p>It's not my place to say which area of research is more important.  That's a subjective question, and the answer depends on your value system, your outlook, and your willingness to wait.  Obviously, I think that compiler optimization is more useful, because compilers are actually <i>in use</i> today.  In 100 years...who knows?<p>That said, I think you're laboring under the assumption that compiler optimization is a ""mature"" field, and that it is ""solved"" (and therefore less important), whereas protein folding is not ""solved"" (and therefore more important).  The thing is, people have been doing protein folding research for at least fifty years -- it is a <i>very</i> mature field, and the low-hanging fruit has been picked.  I think that a new researcher is equally likely to make significant gains in either field, but that the potential for practical impact is still much greater in compiler design.",1214025328

I guess that's as good as it gets when you open your universal service to the world, along with the stupid people which occupy it, with all their cheap-gags.<p>I just hope Hacker News will stay as close to it is now, for years to come! :)",1214024729

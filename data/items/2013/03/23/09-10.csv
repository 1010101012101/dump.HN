However, once I pass my nervousness, I can come across as <i>""Excited, engaged, confident, interested in your problems""</i> as you said, and also most times funny and fun to work with! However, I believe that in truth, whilst I can be funny, I'm not <i>that much</i> fun to work with. I can be argumentative, picky, stubborn and not easy to compromise.<p>I try to work on these attitude issues, but it's not something so easy for me to fix. However, in the interview context, like going on a date, I obviously won't expose those faults.<p>So there's definitely a disparity between the first impression a person can give, even over 5 hour pair programming sessions, and working day after day with them...",1364032636

See, I would see it the other way around.  Working conditions are real things that effect me day-to-day.<p>My experience?  usually when you go work somewhere, your /actual/ job has absolutely nothing to do with what you got interviewed for.    All this talk about 'the problem the company is trying to solve'  is, well, marketing bullshit.<p>Hell, if you are hired on early, the people running the company don't (actually) know the answer to that question beyond ""make enough money to cover payroll.""<p>If you are hired on late, usually, your job is to do what your managers want, not to try to do what the company needs.  Usually, if you do the latter, you will spend all your time in conflict with existing management structures.<p>I mean, part of that is that people are stupid, sure, and everyone wants to protect and grow their little kingdoms.<p>But part of that is that even if you really are as good as you think you are at your role (and most people aren't)  you don't know everything.<p>I know that as a young sysadmin I got into a bunch of fights with my boss about how to do things.  Now that I have my own company? my employees sometimes get into fights with me over the exact same things.   I mean, now that I've gotta look at it from the business perspective as well as the technical perspective, I can see where my boss was coming from way back when.",1364032600

Too many nonprofits, he says, are rewarded for how little they spend -- not for what they get done. Instead of equating frugality with morality, he asks us to start rewarding charities for their big goals and big accomplishments (even if that comes with big expenses).

Every single time.<p>This is true... but only because the workplace is run by total fucking idiots.<p>I mean, I'm one of those people who always looks way better in the interview than I actually am.   Excited, engaged, confident, interested in your problems...  but seriously?  you'd rather have me?  some overconfident douchenozzle over someone smart?  I know of several setups where I was interviewing against someone I know was better than me, where I won.  I remember once, I got a guy who used to work for me an interview at a place where I had a full-time sysadmin job.  (For much of my career, I've alternated between doing my own company, and working for other people.)  the guy didn't get the job, apparently because he didn't interrupt my boss enough (who kept getting interruptions throughout the interview.)<p>The hilarious thing is that I'm a total mercenary;  I'll leave your sorry ass for the first 20% raise I can get, while those people with a 'poor attitude'  will stay at the same place even though they are underpaid and treated poorly, for years.<p>It's kind of like how employers prefer tall white guys.  It's fucking retarded, but if I turned down all jobs where I think that worked in my favor?  I'd turn down a lot of well-paying work.<p>I mean, sure, if it is mercenary work;  if you want a problem (in my area of expertise) solved and then you want someone who is cool with being let go the next day?  I'm probably a pretty good choice.  I don't expect loyalty or anything;  pay me on time for the hours I worked and I'm happy.   I also do pretty well when one needs to ignore social mores or corporate bullshit to get something done.   (I'm terrible, though, when /following/ those rules is important.)  And I'm not completely stupid.   Certainly, there are times when you won't be able to find someone better, in which case, you take what you can get, eh?<p>But for full-time ""we want you to stick around for a while"" jobs?  I'm a comparatively terrible choice... I mean, assuming you have other applicants that are smarter and have basic competency.   but from what I've seen?  I do way better than people who are obviously more competent than I am, because of that arrogance.",1364029944

Because RS-232 serial ports are rare these days on laptops and even desktops, its easier to use the RPi as a bridge between PC applications and electronics/hardware devices which use RS-232. The PC application connects to the RPi using a direct TCP/IP cable. Its a bit more complicated than that, but that's the general idea.",1364029737

Well, not necessarily.<p>By definition high-profile entrepreneurs (like Jobs, Gates, Branson, etc) are rare and their multi-zillion-companies are also rare. I miss general lack of analysis of ""common success strategies"". Call me eccentric, but if I am building a company, I'd like to base my strategy to something that will give me the best chance to do it. And, in case I decide to not use it, know that I am doing so.",1364029696

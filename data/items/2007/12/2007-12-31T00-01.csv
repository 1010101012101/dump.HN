93768,comment,93716,93732,0,0,nailer,,,"""Google's core Internet-scale infrastructure is built on customized open source software.""<p>Yes, but Google infrastructure isn't considered as innovative as Pagerank, which is proprietary.<p>I personally disagree that ranking pages by the amount of sites that link to them is properly patentable in terms of being non-obvious to an engineer skilled in the area, but that's off topic.<p>PS. Your whole post should be:
 ""Nearly all implementations of advanced programming languages are open source and Google's core Internet-scale infrastructure is built on customized open source software.""

93763,comment,93537,93747,0,0,timr,,,"You're throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  Every established institution has trouble being nimble; every established institution can be accused of certain  ""irrationalities"". <p>No offense, but your comment doesn't pass my smell test:  you're quick to launch into an attack on grades, tests and authority, but you're slow to acknowledge that those grades, tests and authority are actually <i>helpful</i> to most students.  I'm as curious and hard-working as anyone you'll meet, but there are still tons of things that I never would have learned, had I not had exams and grades to prod me along (and for the record, no, I didn't have the smoothest possible educational experience).<p>Bottom line:  it doesn't take super-human effort to get through an undergraduate degree in a subject that you enjoy.  If one can't summon the basic discipline to put up with the (minor) bullshit associated with a undergraduate education, then they're very likely going to be disappointed by the world outside of the ivory tower.   The ""real world"" isn't exactly known for a lack of bullshit;  dealing with it (i.e. having discipline and tenacity) is as marketable a skill as knowing how to code.",1199061112

I still stop by Slashdot regularly, but haven't visited reddit for almost a year now.<p>Slashdot seems to have found at least a local minima in balancing editorial selection and audience participation.

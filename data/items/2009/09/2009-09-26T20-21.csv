Sure Lilly Allen might have gone a little overboard, but its a valid complaint.<p>Artists need to be paid just like everyone else.  The fact that they get paid so much more money than most of the rest of us do is irrelevant.  It doesn't mean we are entitled to steal from them.  If you are pirating music then you are cheating the artist.  And if you enjoy the song why steal it?  I mean you can probably buy it off iTunes for 99 cents to a $1.29<p>That said, I must admit that I enjoyed Dan Bull's song.  It is funny, but I don't think that pirating is funny.<p>We can't force everybody to go open source, and we certainly shouldn't complain when other people complain about getting their work stolen and distributed without getting any benefit from it.",1253998612

This can happen when trying new boot programs that don't work or for some reason the NAND become partally erased. When this happens the OMAP will begin running the broken program and never make it to the MMC/SD card thus turning your system into a brick. Fortunately there is a small button (#25 above) that when pressed, will reverse the device boot order (i.e. it will start at the MMC/SD then try the NAND). This allows a simple method to recover the system by using a normal flasher SD.</i><p>Sounds like there are still a few issues to take care of, but all in all I am very impressed.  This is great work, especially when you consider that they pretty much designed everything from scratch.  The device is still sort of ugly and the most notable omission would appear to be keyboard support (perhaps they plan to make an onscreen keyboard.)<p>At the moment it is still more of a game console.<p>The software section of the site is limited, but there are lots of fascinating pictures in the hardware section.

If this change was made with the mindset that ""friends"" will automatically vote eachother up I think its probably a mistake.  My reasoning here is that the voting up will still occur regardless of the value shown or not, if anything it might promote people to vote someone they like up just to contribute to the magical score thats hidden away.  If they were to see that the person already has 10 votes its possible they might feel that was enough value already assigned to the comment.",1253996761

The difference is that chess playing abilities isn't so readily visible as bulging muscles are.</i><p>Such limits are unknown until the given person puts many, many years of work into a particular goal (often at least five years.)  That's because limits are not defined by where one starts, but where one plateaus for multiple years following some kind of improvement over the prior five, ten, fifteen years.<p>Genetics may help push somebody over a plateau they would otherwise have hit sooner (just as having a good coach, training regimen, knowing one's own body, etc, will help as well).  But discovering that one is genetically superior (which, for somebody with a given gift, could simply mean that he or she is able to accomplish something one second faster than somebody else with the same training experience in the entire lives--something hard to duplicate) doesn't displace the years of work it took to reach a point where genetics start to be the limiting factor.<p>For every person a journalist might say has a gift, there are hundreds of other people with the same level of achievement nobody writes about.  There are about 2,000 active NFL players.  There are many grandmasters.  There are many active runners, swimmers, etc who are comparable to the fastest people of 50 years ago, but are slower than the current world record holders.  All of these people have to train hard to get to where they are.<p>For example:  it's possible that somebody on Hacker News has the kind of muscle fibers that speed runners dream of.  However, that person would never know they are athletically gifted because they never got to the point where this ability mattered; e.g., their cardiovascular system runs out of gas quickly and they never bothered to keep trying, to see how good they could actually be.<p>Recap:  do genetics matter at differentiating the best from the best?  Yes.  Are people who are not the best in a particular arena missing those genes they need to be Gary Kasparov, Randy Moss, Wayne Gretzky?  Very unlikely.  It's more likely they are missing the 5, 10, 15 years of exerted effort at that particular mission.<p>The best in the world are better than <i>those who have tried to do the same professionally for many years.</i>  However, there are hundreds of millions of people out there who could be close to the best, who have not even tried (often, for the sake of a career, family, education.)  Genetics are really one of the least important differentiators when comparing a professional (anything) to somebody who is doing something else.  Therefore, the genetic argument is very, very weak.",1253995892

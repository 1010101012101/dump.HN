6324879,comment,6322352,6324218,1,0,mpyne,,,"Well you know, that&#x27;s just it; I don&#x27;t agree that scrapping the War on Drugs would upend the legal system. It would presumably clear out the prisons for the most part, but that&#x27;s not what we should be worried about.<p>However many of the legal and investigatory techniques used to investigate drug-related &quot;crimes&quot; are perfectly cromulent ways to investigate many other <i>actual</i> crimes. I would like to keep those techniques available, in general. Each technique may or may not have it&#x27;s place, for sure.<p>But a useful, cost-effective tool that&#x27;s not otherwise unconstitutional <i>should</i> be used. We should then make sure that the oversight and transparency measures for each type of tool is in place to ensure that such measures are not abused.<p>The government is pretty much literally the only thing we the people have <i>any</i> input into... functions which rightly belong to &quot;the people&quot; at large <i>should</i> be placed into the government. Where government screws those up, the answer should be to <i>fix</i> the government, not for the people to completely abdicate that responsibility.<p>> How does it follow that we should then make sure the shit is evenly spread on everybody?<p>You&#x27;re basically asking why a given system should be fairly applied? I would reverse the question completely and say that any given government system should <i>start off completely fair</i> and only deviate from that for very good reason.<p>Avoiding &quot;Misery Loves Company&quot; <i>is</i> a good reason, mind you. We levy administrative fines on people who actually screw up, for example.<p>But the Simon logic is, why is it permissible to surveil tens of thousands of cell phone calls within a predominantly poor, black & Hispanic neighborhood for <i>literally</i> years at a time, looking for evidence of small-time drug dealers, but it&#x27;s not possible to get the same type of court order to surveil other communications (even at larger scale) for something that&#x27;s <i>actually</i> important to society at large?<p>There is a difference in scale, that&#x27;s for sure. But the difference is not really as large as the difference between no surveillance and what the police/FBI/others are already doing (and have been doing) throughout America. And so that&#x27;s his point, if America agrees that this type of investigatory powers should be used (the kind that have <i>always</i> permitted incidentally collecting too much, or searching through <i>all</i> records reasonably relevant to a case, etc.), where and <i>why</i> does the framework behind those powers actually end here when it didn&#x27;t there?<p>There may very well be a good reason, but if that reason is &quot;we don&#x27;t trust the government&quot; then by what logic do we let the DoJ in general investigate criminal acts? I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that I really wish we would get back to a framework of <i>control</i> of government (like the EFF, ACLU, etc. have been pushing to do for years) instead of instinctive distrust of the idea of government.<p>But whatever we <i>do</i> decide the government rightly has the power to do, we should at least be consistent with it.",1378256027

Geexbox is usually what supports these things.<p>I use a mini-pc (a little asus eeepc box with a &quot;who cares&quot; intel cpu in it and a nvidia gt620m running openelec). The reason is actually simple:
A lot of the embedded processors are much more finicky in terms of hardware decode.<p>I used to run geexbox on a  TI OMAP4460, and it worked wonderfully, right until you hit a track with DTS or DTS-MA audio, and then because it was not hardware supported, it fell right down and couldn&#x27;t even play at 3fps.  Maybe with XBMC now having a new audio engine (This was in the XBMC 11 days) the world is different.<p>The hardware decoders were also not quite as resilient to restart and had occasionally random failures compared to the nvidia chipset , which were very annoying when watching movies.  I have <i>never</i> had this happen on anything in the nvidia/amd/intel world, and anything that can&#x27;t be hardware decoded, the intel can absolutely handle.<p>Given the very low idle state of the newer haswell chips, unless you had a strong desire to not be intel based, i&#x27;d see if i could find a mobile motherboard and run openelec on a 15w TDP mobile haswell (or at worst, an itx motherboard and core i3 haswell).<p>Basically, these boxes are fun if you want to futz, but just aren&#x27;t really &quot;living room ready&quot; unless you have a very fixed set of source video/audio.",1378254500

Linkedin doesn&#x27;t have to simply sustain its level of profits, it has to grow, and grow extremely rapidly, just to justify the current price of the stock. So people buying the stock now think that Linkedin will eventually do even better than THAT. I disagree with those people.<p>It&#x27;s not that Linkedin isn&#x27;t an excellent company or isn&#x27;t making lots of money, it&#x27;s that it is overvalued in the market unless its profits somehow balloon.

This is a peculiar problem: past statist diseases like Fascism, Theocracy or Communism were easy to diagnose: they said what they meant and meant what they said.<p>At this point, surgery or chemotherapy won&#x27;t do.

Your living expenses may well <i>increase</i> while you are unemployed, for example due to paying for your own health insurance (in the U.S., you will likely be eligible for limited duration continuation under COBRA, but you will have to pay the entire cost of that insurance out of pocket).<p>As for the staying in unhappy circumstances:  Trust your intuition as to whether the &quot;balance&quot; is acceptable.

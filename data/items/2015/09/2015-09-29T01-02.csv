10294344,comment,10291688,10293902,0,0,eru,,,"Point to where the decisions are in SKI calculus.  SKI calculus is as strong as Turing machines and lambda calculus.<p>(If you squint right, you can see the decision making bit.  But it&#x27;s a tight squint.)<p>--- (from Wikipedia:)<p>The evaluation operation is defined as follows:<p>(x, y, and z represent expressions made from the functions S, K, and I, and set values):<p>I returns its argument:<p><pre><code>    Ix = x
</code></pre>
K, when applied to any argument x, yields a one-argument constant function Kx , which, when applied to any argument, returns x:<p><pre><code>    Kxy = x
</code></pre>
S is a substitution operator. It takes three arguments and then returns the first argument applied to the third, which is then applied to the result of the second argument applied to the third. More clearly:<p><pre><code>    Sxyz = xz(yz)
</code></pre>

When you start from the user experience, you usually end up working your way back from the front-end: first you visualize what the user should see, then you mock up screens to give them that, then you figure out what they should be able to interact with and how, then you write code to make that happen, then you define data structures that make the code possible.  When you start from data, you identify what data the user will need to manipulate, then you identify relationships between that data, then you write code to manipulate it, then you slap a UI in front, one which usually mimics the relationships you identified a priori.<p>There&#x27;s a bit of an impedance mismatch here.  Start from the UX, and you end up with a bunch of ad-hoc data structures that are very difficult to rationalize and inefficient to access.  Start from the data, and you end up with a UI that mimics the data you were given and not how the user thinks about achieving their task.<p>The solution is to write a quick & dirty prototype focusing on UX, nailing it but focusing on <i>only</i> the happy-path that&#x27;s core to the user experience.

Despite the unfortunate reality of anthropogenic climate change, the really key thing to realize is that transitions to alternate forms of energy take decades because the scale of such transitions is absolutely enormous; these changes take longer and longer with every major transition, i.e. wood to coal, or coal to oil; oil to whatever&#x27;s next could take a century [2].  The earth has about 1300 billion barrels of &#x27;proven&#x27; oil reserves[3] which at current consumption rates of ~100 million barrels per day [4] gives us about 36 years of oil left.  And that assumes that, despite rapid increases in population size and economic development, that consumption won&#x27;t change.<p>36 years isn&#x27;t very long to develop the new energy technology, test it sufficiently, and build the infrastructure.  Oil is the hardest to replace of all of our energy sources because it has the highest energy density and is therefore integral to transportation.  Replacing coal with solar + nuclear would be a better option because both are based on stationary power plants instead of car engines and jet turbines.  But in reality, if oil gets expensive now, we&#x27;ll just start burning more coal because the pieces are already in place.<p>Like it or not (I definitely do not like it), we are a society very reliant upon fossil fuels, and if fossil fuel accessibility is restricted substantially (i.e. by completely stopping oil exploration) there will be considerable destabilization of society, which will do two particularly nasty things: 1) Harm the poor disproportionately, by making it difficult or impossible for the poor in developed nations to heat their houses and drive to work and school, and raising the cost of food substantially; and by completely stopping if not reversing the economic development of the rest of the world, keeping billions in poverty.  2) Wreak tremendous havoc on the environment, as the forests are cut down to provide wood for heating and cooking, and the fisheries and wild animal stock is razed due to high food prices.<p>There are no great solutions to the problem, but there are some that are much better than the current status quo of doing nothing, or the opposite end-member solution of enforcing an otherwise unlikely peak oil catastrophe by stopping exploration.  Taxing carbon and using the proceeds to fund new energy technology as well as ramping up current alternative energy production both domestically and in India and Africa, and implementing more efficient transportation, heating and electricity generation could go a long way.<p>[1] 2012 levels, from <i>Energy Revolution</i> by Mara Prentiss

All that is needed is a front-end proxy that takes each session[1] and rewrites all href/src addresses to point to the proxy. This means all URLs in the page are of the form<p><pre><code>    https;//example.com/proxy/<crypto-token>
    # or in the no-cookie case
    https://example.com/proxy/<crypto-token>/<session-id>
</code></pre>
Rewriting client-side generated URLs is an exercise left for the relevant Javascript framework, but only requires the addition of a simple API in the proxy to convert URLs, or some sort of bypass/whitelist mechanism.<p>The tokens used by the proxy can either be the cyphertext of the actual URL or a synthetic token that references the real URL stored in a DB in the proxy. Such details can are left to the implementation of the proxy.<p>The point is that you have to send the crypto token back to the proxy to get either 1) a redirect of the real URL, 2) the actual content served by the site in question (either from the proxy directly or as a tunnel, or 3) the advertisement/whatever, with the prox6y acting as a live proxy to real ad server, with all the stupid tracking information passed along as extra HTTP headers (in the style of &quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;). The client only ever sees URLs from the single domain, each obfuscated into a crypto token. No URL would give up any distinguishing characteristic an adblocker can use as a filter.<p>The only costs are the cost of running the proxy, and a bit of latency on each GET request because of the extra hop through the proxy.<p>It might be possible to find heuristics to block in the client&#x27;s DOM, which is why I have expressed concern in the past[2] about the people who will use WebAssembly and a <canvas> tag to bypass the DOM. These two techniques in combination will make adblocking nearly impossible without first either breaking crypto or solving the halting problem.<p>[1] As defined in the usual manner, either as a cookie or embedded in the URLs the proxy generates.<p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10211050"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10211050</a>",1443488759

You may recognize that name--in 2011, when he was executed, he was the world&#x27;s most famous death row inmate. Like Glossip, Troy Davis had no physical evidence against him. His conviction (of murdering a police officer) was based primarily on 9 eyewitness testimonies. SEVEN of those eyewitnesses recanted or altered their testimonies, many citing police coercion or intimidation. Ten new witnesses came forward saying one of the two non-recanting witnesses, Sylvester Coles, confessed to the murder.<p>A few days before he was executed, ONE MILLION people signed a petition to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles. Despite this, and the many doubts in his case, Troy Davis was executed on September 21, 2011.<p>I was close friends with Troy--I first visited him on death row in 2008 (when I was 15), and spent the next three years visiting him, corresponding with him, and talking to him on the phone. Troy was so well-known because his case epitomized everything that is wrong with the American justice system and the death penalty--racial bias (he was a black man accused of killing a white cop in 1980s Georgia), an overzealous DA with a history of prosecutorial misconduct, police coercion and witness tampering, the execution of innocents (over a dozen death row inmates have been exonerated since he was executed in 2011...how many innocents were executed in that time?) and a justice system so rigid and brittle that it would not even commute his sentence to life imprisonment, despite even a federal judge admitting Troy had shown at least a &quot;minimal&quot; level of doubt in his case.<p>Troy&#x27;s last words, recorded minutes before he was executed, are haunting: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98dlGv0k2MM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98dlGv0k2MM</a><p>In 2012, I raised 11k on Kickstarter to write a book on my relationship with Troy Davis called Remain Free[2]. It talks about many of the ugly aspects of his life on death row and of the legal corruption in his case that he (and I) couldn&#x27;t publicly talk about while he was still alive. Since the book is built on hundreds of recorded conversations, in person visits, and letters with Troy, you really get a sense of who he was as a person and the kind of toll two decades on death row takes on him and his family.<p>If you&#x27;d like a copy, you can order it on Amazon[3] or through <a href=""http://remainfree.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://remainfree.com</a>.

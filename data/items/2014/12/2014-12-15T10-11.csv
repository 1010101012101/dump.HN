Then a long time went by.<p>Okay, maybe it was a little silly to imply that it was worth $400 over the course of one&#x27;s lifetime.  But I have to live up to my namesake once in awhile.<p>Consider this: What if Pinboard was pay-what-you-want?  I wonder if the average revenue would be closer to $40/person than to $10/person.  Or, if it&#x27;s still the same average price, I wonder if it would&#x27;ve resulted in higher total volume (many more sales).<p>It&#x27;s interesting to realize that, barring some catastrophe, I&#x27;ll be using both Dropbox and Pinboard in 10 years.  That means I&#x27;ll have paid Dropbox $1,200 and Pinboard $10 (or $110 after the pricing change.)  Maybe that&#x27;s the right price point.  I don&#x27;t know.<p>Monetization is a weird and fascinating subject to me.  There&#x27;s a lot of counterintuitive aspects to it.  In particular, it&#x27;s possible to drive customers away by trying to nickel-and-dime them.  Yet it&#x27;s also possible to turn your back on a lot of money without realizing it.

The increase in prices was because of the surge in demand and it was good. It ensures drivers would move to this area to make some quick money and number of cars would go up substantially potentially saving more lives. $100 is actually far too less amount for an Uber driver with Prius to put his life in danger and ferry passengers it could have been more.

His wife was displeased with his decision though <i>might</i> be tempted to ride along sometimes.  Another friend decided to <i>stop</i> riding a few years back because he felt it was too risky for him to continue.<p>Point is with motorcycles, cars, scuba, yes, even horses, the risks are more or less known and probability of various outcomes, including harm, can be reasoned about.<p>With drugs the estimation of probable outcomes is orders of magnitude more difficult to compute.  To say it again, all drugs have <i>numerous effects</i> which vary greatly among recipients, and even for established agents <i>most drug effects have received little or no study</i>.  However we do have a systematic track record of the AEs encountered, and after millions of cases we have a pretty good idea of how to use the agent safely.<p>Legal status notwithstanding, a drug with potent enough effects to be interesting is asymptotically guaranteed to have adverse effects in some members of the population of potential users.  It means effects of a new and arcane product are no more than a total crap shoot.<p>Since even low frequencies of AEs may disqualify a drug as &quot;safe&quot;, regulatory bodies require testing sufficiently large number of subjects under tightly controlled conditions to show evidence that it&#x27;s safe enough to justify its proposed uses.<p>Without such study it is impossible to evaluate the use of an unvetted drug in the same way as riding a motorcycle.  The information about benefits and risks is just not known.  There is simply no basis for making a rational decision.<p>As a clinician and scientist questions of prohibition are largely beside the point.  People will continue to do stupid things laws aside.  However, laws/rules exist as a benchmark, and optimally serve as a statement of our communal ethical stance.  Not that it&#x27;s going to stop people who are determined to use a prohibited drug anyway, but maybe it supports restraint in some people who are &quot;on the edge&quot;.<p>In respect to designer drugs, I&#x27;m very reluctant to say let&#x27;s have no regulations at all, that anything goes, because logically lack of safety data leaves us to assume the risk of harm is significant.  The burden of proof ought to be on the shoulders of those who assert use of the drugs is just harmless diversion.",1418639843

Not to mention Mediatek that will eventually come with integrated cellular (including 4G). So for Rockchip, it may simply be a defensive move: life is too hard and competitive on the ARM side, so try to find a niche in the x86 side. I&#x27;m very doubtful it&#x27;ll work out: the volume is in the low/mid tiers, and the average consumer doesn&#x27;t care about the CPU architecture. It&#x27;s just a basic Android tablet, period. I don&#x27;t see a worthwhile differentiation on Intel side, except the current crazy subsidies but those can&#x27;t last forever.

Yes, Rust has some interesting safety features that prevent some issues that you can run into with C++ (but not all).  
And yes, most of us will agree that header files suck and the rust approach here is nicer.
That template error message are also PITA is also well known - but on the other hand templates are different (and more powerful) than generics.<p>On the other hand there are still a few constructs that I&#x27;m using using often enough in C++ that have currently no sane representation in Rust and that are astonishingly never mentioned in these articles:<p>- Everything that you use the friend keyword for. In Rust there is no way to access private data defined in other file (because that will automatically be another module which is also something I disagree with).<p>- Most things related to inheritance and interfaces. Composition is not always a better solution and Rusts traits seem still more suited for compile-time polymorphism than to runtime polymorphism. As an example try to find the equivalent of a `shared_ptr<SomeThing> thing(new SomeThing()); shared_ptr<ISomeThing> iface = thing` in Rust. And yes, I want to be able to use both afterwards.<p>- <i></i>Enabling<i></i> concurrency. Some people might disagree but I think Rust is currently mostly good at preventing multithreading issues - but not at providing good and easy ways to enable it. E.g. something like boost asio would be between hard to impossible to implement in Rust because the safety mechanisms disagree with callbacks that mutate state or Future objects (which are similar to callbacks). For some things using low-level primitives like channels (aka queues) and creating new threads might be fine, but there are also enough cases where you would prefer a simple singlethreaded eventloop.<p>All in all I think there are still enough areas where I think Rust still is (unfortunatly) no real alternative for C++. And as long as that&#x27;s the case I think writing such biased articles isn&#x27;t fair.",1418638811

10584920,comment,10574167,10584797,0,0,nostrademons,,,"For a few reasons:<p>1.) Just by choosing to use a framework, you incur costs: download time, initialization time, complexity & bug surface area, etc.  You should make sure that you gain benefits commensurate with those costs.  If you start by picking a random framework, then a.) how can you measure what the costs were? and b.) how do you know what sort of benefits would be most useful to you?<p>2.) Relatedly, starting from a baseline random framework can teach you lessons that are <i>not true</i>, and then you base your product decisions on that.  For example, there&#x27;s a common meme that you cannot have smooth 60fps animations on mobile websites.  This is not true; however, getting smooth 60fps animations on the mobile web requires careful attention to which elements will render on the GPU and which won&#x27;t, and no framework currently in existence will help you with that.  Back in 2008 when I did my first startup, it was generally believed that Javascript was too slow for games; not true, <i>JQuery</i> was too slow for games.  Doing things that others believe to be impossible is the essence of competitive advantage.<p>3.) Frameworks make certain tasks easy at the expense of making other tasks hard.  If you start with a random framework, you will be incentivized to do things in the same way that everyone else who uses that framework is.  That&#x27;s why almost every web 2.0 startup started from around 2007-2010 looks like a frontend over a database.  Looking like everyone else is a recipe for failure in business.<p>4.) The framework authors are all subject to the constraints of the browser; however, browser vendors (and people who program directly to web APIs) are not subject to the constraints of the framework.  The set of programs that you can write efficiently without a framework is a strict superset of the set that you can write efficiently with one.<p>5.) It&#x27;s easier to add code than to remove it.  If you start with no framework and then decide that you need one, you&#x27;ve written only the code that you actually <i>did</i> need for your problem.  If you start with a random framework and then decide it&#x27;s not appropriate, you need to backtrack and identify what you were actually trying to accomplish before you shoehorned it into the framework.",1447804760

I&#x27;m not just talking about the kind that jingles in your pocket like sleigh bells, but that&#x27;s nice too. I&#x27;m talking about HOSTING!<p>You may have noticed over the past year or two that we&#x27;ve totally amped up our VPS game. We&#x27;ve increased memory. We&#x27;ve installed super-fast slick new SSDs for lightning-fast data access. AND we&#x27;ve lowered prices.<p>Now we&#x27;re about to roll out another change to our VPS services that may affect you!<p>We will be removing admin (sudo) access from all DreamHost VPS instances.<p>All of our Virtual Private Servers are managed. That is to say that we provide you with a specific software environment and we work hard to keep it up to date with security patches and all the latest updates. When users take server management into their own hands with the &quot;sudo&quot; command, this can limit our own ability to provide a safe and reliable managed hosting environment.<p>The good news, for users looking to have more control over their hosting environment, is that our cloud computing service, DreamCompute, is completely unmanaged. Install whatever software you like! Don&#x27;t need a web server? No problem! We&#x27;ll provide you with a base OS install (or you can even upload your own!) and that&#x27;s it. Use sudo, or heck, just login as root if you want!<p>DreamCompute provides the full and complete remote server control that so many of our VPS users have been craving for years.<p>Timing!<p>Sudo access will be disabled on Monday, November 30, 2015.<p>Please be sure to check out DreamCompute if you&#x27;re looking for virtual computing resources but want full control of everything! We think you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s a great complement to traditional, managed VPS services.<p>As always, our brilliant tech support team is on standby if you&#x27;ve got any questions about this change. You can contact them from the Support section of your account control panel at any time.",1447804564

10584906,comment,10573166,10584218,0,0,arthurbrown,,,"Russ Cox wrote a great comment[1] on HN about why using the Plan9 toolchain rather LLVM or even GCC was a competitive advantage for them in terms of speed to delivery, control, and iteration.<p>&quot;Most importantly, it has been something we understand completely and is quite easy to adapt as needed. The standard ABIs and toolchains are for C, and the decisions made there may be completely inappropriate for languages with actual runtimes.<p>For example, no standard ABIs and toolchains supported segmented stacks; we had to build that, so it was going to be incompatible from day one. If step one had been &quot;learn the GCC or LLVM toolchains well enough to add segmented stacks&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;d have gotten to step two.&quot;<p>&quot;... the custom toolchain is one of the key reasons we&#x27;ve accomplished so much in so little time. I think the author doesn&#x27;t fully appreciate all the reasons that C tools don&#x27;t work well for languages that do so much more than C. Most other managed languages are doing JIT compilation and don&#x27;t go through standard linkers either.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8817990"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8817990</a>",1447804541

This is why we would expect elements like Al and U to never show isotopic ratios associated with biological activity. Fe is used in living things, but only rarely. (The human body is 0.0006% Fe by weight.) To propose a biological origin for massive iron deposits is so far outside of what we know about biochemistry that it is not a legitimate proposal as is.

Code ended up looking like:<p><pre><code>    fooify(element) {\n      element.offset().then((rect) {\n        // do stuff\n        otherelement.offset().then((rect) {\n          // do more stuff\n        });\n      });\n    }\n</code></pre>\nUnderstandably, developers didn&#x27;t like it, and unfortunately it was removed. This was before Futures and Streams had been made completely ubiquitous in Dart, and before async/await. Now the code would look like:<p><pre><code>    fooify(element) async {\n      var h = await element.offsetHeight;\n      // do stuff\n      var h2 = await otherelement.offsetHeight;\n      // do more stuff\n    }\n</code></pre>\nwhich is much more palatable.<p>> There&#x27;d also been talk of doing a subset of HTML that includes only the operations that can be done quickly, but to my knowledge, that never went anywhere.

But starting in the September 2014 school year the law was changed to charge a fixed margin over the 10 year rate -- 3.6% for graduate Stafford loans and 4.6% for graduate PLUS loans. I don&#x27;t know what rate Earnest is borrowing at, but AA rated 10 year corporates are yielding just about 3%. That leaves somewhere between 60 and 160 basis points to make their profit. Even if their underwriting is near perfect, there are still servicing costs.<p>Certainly that&#x27;s enough of a spread to make money, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like some huge opportunity. FWIW I scratch my head for the same reason about mortgages given the narrow spreads, but there companies don&#x27;t actually plan on holding the loans on their books (most end up on some set of government books in recent years). So that&#x27;s more of a services volume business than it is an underwriting one.<p>Edit: I just re-read this and I made a mistake. The 3.6 and 4.6 are above the 10 year treasury which is around 2.3. So the spread between the AA rate and the loan is 290 to 390 bps not 60 to 160. A considerably better situation.",1447802139

After everything you&#x27;ve mentioned, the second income financially disqualifies you from many childcare and other benefits available to single-income families while progressive taxation, sold as targeting the wealthy, instead swallows the money a middle income family could have used to pay for those things out of pocket.<p>And after the government has laid claim to most of the second income, what&#x27;s left becomes the baseline for the cost of living. More families now have two incomes so it takes two incomes to afford a home in a good school district.<p>It seems what is needed but not present is a strong lobby for middle class families. Everyone pays lip service because they&#x27;re a large voting block, but where is the equivalent of the AARP or NRA for families with children?",1447801705

I am glad that HN is having a conversation a 100 times more serious and intellectual than I am seeing on popular Western and Muslim media.<p>First of all Daesh are a bunch of psychopaths and a far greater threat and problem to people like me. Their every move has been against not just non-Muslims or moderate Muslims but also and even more so against mainstream and all major currents of Sunni Islam. If people are interested, I can provide specific sources to support this assertion.<p>From the Muslim world side, we have a huge mess. I wanted to put in my two cents for Westerners trying to understand WTH is going on with the Muslim world. Basically, the Assad regime, nominally &quot;secular, progressive&quot; tyrants such as the Egyptian and Algerian militaries or Kurdish marxist armies, numerous &quot;radical&quot; Sunni and Shia groups have all been at fault since they could not agree on a set of principles on which disagreeing parties could come to peace. The long Iraqi civil war brutalised already damaged societies. This produced the sort of psychopaths such as Zarqawi and Baghdadi and numerous others. Also, even otherwise somewhat moderate Sunnis have been driven into ISIS&#x27;s arms and somewhat moderate Nusayrites and Shi&#x27;ites have been driven into Ass&#x27;ads arms because they don&#x27;t see another option. The biggest problem now is that while many people are disgusted by all this, there is so much blame to go around that one can be completely justified in blaming everyone else. So the problem is that people sympathetic to Assad (old-style socialists, Shi&#x27;ites etc.) sit there blaming the Saudis, Turks and the &quot;West&quot; for the supporting rebels who they say are all Daesh. On the other hand, Assad has killed and driven out many times more refugees than Daesh, and many Syrians and Sunnis find it hypocritical and self-serving to support Assad like Putin is doing while neglecting the plight of the Syrian population being hammered both from Assad and Daesh. The conspiracy theorist streak finds it easy to blame the US, without trying to eliminate the local actors who are instruments of said conspiracy, if they really believe there is one.<p>Unless all sides are brave enough to not only fight for their principles but more importantly admit their own mistakes it is hard to fix this.

5500679,comment,5500388,5500633,5,0,1053r,,,"The flaw in the argument is that BitCoin is not (currently) a unit of account (we don't price contracts or goods or services in BTC), and is (nearly) infinitely divisible.<p>So even if 90% (or 99%) of all BTC is being hoarded, the other 10% (or 1%) can be divided up for use in transactions.  That much speculations will cause wild gyrations in value and massive short term volatility, but the people using BTC to transact JUST DON'T CARE.<p>I really don't care if I'm buying my $1000 flat screen with 1 BTC or 0.0001 BTC.  Neither does the merchant.  I bought the BTC, sent it to the merchant, and the merchant sold it so quickly that the value didn't change much, and we are happy.<p>So that's the short term.  In the long run, the volatility might decrease as the total market capitalization increases to 10x or 1000x of its current value.<p>Then we can start to think about using it as a unit of account.  If we do, we may enter a deflationary spiral, but by then BTC will already be used in an enormous swath of the economy.<p>So I interpret Krugman's argument not so much that BTC CAN'T take over the world, but that it SHOULDN'T take over the world. (I'm not sure if I agree.  Many economists have been arguing over this point for decades, and I'm not smart enough to sort it all out.)",1365191878

5500639,comment,5499083,5500334,6,0,anigbrowl,,,"You're not wrong, but you're overlooking a bunch of things. Suppose you grew up in San Francisco - does that count for anything at all, or should you be subject to the same economic headwinds as people who just arrived? What about the costs of relocation and re-establishment elsewhere? As someone who has moved several times in search of opportunity (which is how I came to SF, in fact), you need a minimum of about $2,000 to move and get through the first month or two, and that's assuming you have no dependents and are reasonably street-savvy. Indeed, I'm underestimating that slightly because I've always moved to places with fairly high levels of density and moderately good public transport. If you move to somewhere that you need a car just to get around, then those costs are a lot higher, not to mention the opportunity costs of the time you now have to spend driving. If you move somewhere where you have no connections you're at an economic disadvantage fora  while until you can build your personal network, especially if you don't have an obvious marketable skill.<p>At bottom, the problem is that the people who are in the most tenuous economic position are the least likely to have the skills and resources needed to just up and move somewhere else. It's true that subsidies do display other people who would like to move to SF and could afford it better, but they don't have any right to move there either. In general I'm strongly in favor of efficiency, but I think you're over-discounting the economic value of cohesive communities and internal economic diversity. Also, you're overlooking another alternative, which is to loosen constraints on development and allow the city to build upward more.

But that's one avenue for this discussion.<p>Let's talk about that. I know someone who was diagnosed with a mental illness. They got medical care for their condition, but due to the way we discuss mental illness, it harmed more than it hurt. They gave me an account of how, once they started working with a different doctor, the change in language was revelatory towards resolving their symptoms. The first doctor (and the most 'normal' one) used language such as ""You are a schizophrenic."" This defines the person by the disease, and begins from a place where they are already limited. It's as though it's a life sentence, and they're just making time until they die. Even the small shift to ""You are living with schizophrenia"" did wonders for their condition: instead of being limited by the disease, they were just another person, working to limit a negative aspect of their life. The relationship was turned upside down.<p>(to be clear, I am obscuring details to protect their identity.)<p>Secondly, you are absolutely right that therapy and Prozac are ubiquitous. But the _representation_ of them is the issue. Therapy is for someone who's _crazy_. Someone who can't deal with life. Someone who's deviant. Nobody wants to admit that they are mentally ill. The image of someone who pops Prozac and goes to therapy is not a positive image; it's a profoundly negative one. Rather than celebrate taking steps to overcome a disease, they're just another drug-addicted loser who 'needs help.' The Protestant ideal is still quite alive in our culture.<p>I'll also leave the issue about if drugs are even the best way to treat every instance of mental illness, and if doctors are too quick to write a 'script.<p>Anyway, that's the TL;DR from my current understanding around this issue, both from study and discussion with people close to the issue.",1365190924

Redirect to preferred form.<p>- <i>Logical.</i> Follow a logical structure, that follows the structure of the site. A good URL might read like a breadcrumb: site.com/category/product-name, this works for silo'ing your content. Other sites (such as news sites or without a category) might benefit more from the shortest url possible.<p>- <i>Using dashes for spaces.</i> No underscores, + or %20 spaces.<p>- <i>Not using special chars.</i> Consider replacing  with e and removing any non-alphabet non-number character like: ' "" (<p>- <i>Canonical.</i> There should be only 1 unique URL in a search engines index with a page content. Use canonical or 301's or smart use of URL's to make sure this is the case.<p>- <i>Degradable.</i> What happens if a user visits example.com/category/product-name/ and then removes the /product-name/ part? The URL-structure should allow for this and example.com/category/ should return content (preferably the category description)<p>- <i>Timeless.</i> If you have an event and you set the date inside the URL, then after this date has passed, this URL gets less valuable. Either 301 these aged URL's to the current event URL, or make it so your URL's can be ""re-used"" for future events. Cool URLs don't change.<p>- <i>Optimized for search.</i> Use a keyword tool, to find out what users might be searching for and use the relevant keywords inside your URL. Keyword in URL is a (minute) ranking factor. Bolded keywords in URLs help discoverability.<p>- <i>Not using excessive dynamic variables</i>. These will confuse your users and search engines.<p>- <i>Flat over deep.</i> Hiding content away in many subdirectories can hamper readability and search engine crawling. Avoid example.com/cat/subcat/subsubcat/widgets/green/second-hand/widget-deluxe/reviews<p>- <i>Extension agnostic.</i> An URL ending in .php, .py, .xml, .htm etc. can be changed to another extension in the future, requiring an update or inconsistency in the URLs.<p>- <i>Not spammy.</i> Good URL's don't repeat (slight variations of) keywords or (ab)use extensions like .font or .shoe<p>- <i>Not disclosing technology.</i> There is little reason to add cgi-bin to your URLs (unless you want to confuse your competition). An extension to really avoid is the .exe extension (mapserv.exe?doc=15)<p>- <i>Non-traversable.</i> When using document IDs all URL's can easily be scanned/traversed in a loop or manually. Including URL's not yet ready/or never meant for publication.<p>- <i>Secure.</i> Not susceptible to injection, XSS etc.<p>I'd say URLs are both for humans and machines.",1365189882

Disruption only happens, and read this carefully, when people decide to use your product over any other. And when I mean any other, I mean any other product out there. Say, for example, the iPhone. It disrupted the world. People not only stopped buying other phones, but they stopped buying laptops, desktops, game consoles, video games, televisions, cable boxes, cars, and even stopped making payments to their utilities because they had to have the iPhone. That is real disruption, and it is quite rare. What most companies manage to get is more like stealing someone else's seat in a crowded movie theater. Its profitable, and not a bad thing to achieve. But its not just disruptive.<p>Now, for the love of Zeus, stop using the word.",1365189609

And if they're doing that, it's likely just the domain name, and very rarely anything more than that.<p>If they're clicking a URL, then what the URL looks like is meaningless, and often does not even need to be shown to the user.

Why do they ever even see the URL?<p>If it's visible to the user on a page, then replace the URL in the <a></a> tags with a meaningful description of a URL.

Try another one."" :)<p><i>> Would you prefer a link to <a href=""http://www.example/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example/about</a> or a link to <a href=""http://www.example.com/?id=123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com/?id=123</a>. </i><p>An ""about"" page is a complete different situation, and these static pages are often limited in number on dynamic sites like this article is referring to.

And that doesn't mean to write a ton in your application but instead write concisely enough to answer the question well.<p>I'd also go out on a limb and say that this is a subtle message to applicants to apply as early as possible. PG is admitting that it is indeed difficult for the partners to keep their focus on so many applications throughout this period. Applying earlier gives the partners more time to review our applications and hence, our applications get reviewed thoroughly and they have more time to engage with the applicants (if interested, of course). Essentially, a win-win. Now that I briefly inferred/annotated this part, I definitely wish I had read this section more carefully. I resubmitted my application several times all the way until the day it was due.<p>Anyway, as a follow up to the posted question, how do you manage to continue advising YC alumni while reviewing so many applications?

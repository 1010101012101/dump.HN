One never knows what an artifact will be used for in the future, or what it will inspire to be created next.<p>Regardless, my main argument was against the author's overly sensationalistic and dangerous ""stop writing text editors"" point.",1199036522
93663,comment,93584,93586,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"Are there really enough good companies out there to justify four cycles?  At 20 companies per cycle, 4 cycles per year, 3 cofounders per company, $6000 per cofounder, that's $1,440,000/yr for roughly a 5% stake in each company.  Just to break even, these companies must end up being acquired/liquidated/taken public for a total of $28,800,000... a very high threshold.  Given that YC has only had two or three successful acquisitions (Reddit, Parakey, ???) and only one extremely successful still-private company (Loopt), I'm not sure that YC could beat those odds with four cycles per year.<p>BTW correct me if I'm wrong about the number of YC companies that have been acquired or are doing extremely well... always happy to hear success stories.",1199036278

This site, programming.reddit.com for computer stuff, with a quick glance at lwn.net and slashdot.  The Economist to have something to read for... those moments when the laptop wouldn't be easy to drag along.<p>If I were in Italy or the US, I think I would consider a local paper, to read about local goings on.  If I subscribed to a more international paper, I think I'd go for the Financial Times.<p>I'm a bit of an information junkie:-/",1199035873

These new users represent the common interests moreso than what a bunch of early adopter tech-geeks want to see :)<p>It can sometimes be shocking to remember that the large majority of people on the Internet are not logical and rational.",1199035307
93657,comment,93654,93654,0,0,pg,,,"Not necessarily.  I thought about this from the beginning with News.YC, because I didn't want that to happen here.  The solution I came up with is to pick a group of smart people as editors and weight everyone else's votes based on how much they overlap with the editors'.  Then as long as the editors don't vote for dumb stories, they won't take over the front page.<p>I don't have this turned on, but I do have something in the code that shows me where stories would rank if I did.  The good news is that, as of right now, the front page wouldn't look significantly different if vote weighting were turned on.",1199035284

93655,comment,93537,93630,0,0,angryprofessor,,,"It's true that we were the world leader once upon a time. From the 20's to the early 40's, we had a <i>major</i> competitive advantage: our factories didn't explode much, whereas European and Japanese factories did. In the late 30's and early 40's, there were also trade barriers (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat</a>, <a href=""http://www.navy.mil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.navy.mil</a>) preventing the US from receiving Japanese and European exports.<p>However, in 1945, Europe and Japan figured out how to build non-exploding factories. The trade barriers were also removed. We retained our competitive advantage for some time after that, since it took them time to build up an industrial base. <p>But it is silly to expect us to be world leaders to the extent we were back then. That epidemic of factory explosions was a one time occurrence.",1199034290

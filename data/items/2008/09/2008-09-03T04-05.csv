293555,comment,293450,293543,0,0,breily,,,"I imagine the main issue is the number of eligible receivers different leagues allow.  In the NCAA offensive linemen cannot be receivers, and in the NFL, you have to have at least 7 players on the line of scrimmage, and only 2 of these are eligible (basically linemen aren't eligible).<p>There are probably similar rules in the high school leagues for the other 10 states.",1220416783

On that note - any FF plugin developers that could create a reversal of those 2 items?  If you want to run Chrome and FF - it'd be nice to train yourself in the one way of clicking..",1220416764

A lot of people don't seem to realize that the lion's share of time for a lot of JS stuff is in manipulating the DOM and re-rendering the page.<p>Coupling an advanced javascript compiler/vm with a really quick rendering engine leaves you with what you feel there.<p>Hard numbers, V8 is maybe 3x faster than WebKit nightlies on every benchmark suite I could find.",1220416529

293547,comment,293450,293450,0,0,soundsop,,,"The part about randomness is a red herring. They are choosing from a larger set of plays than is usual. The article implies that this is somehow akin to randomness, but I think that's a bit of a stretch.<p>I do remember some research on using random selection among plays in football to improve offense. Maybe the value of random selection diminishes as the number of possibilities increases.",1220416026

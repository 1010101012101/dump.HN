I am wondering if 10 years from now we are going to have much more ""regulation and security"" for the networks than now. Not only in the US, on the global scale. Who knows, it might be that the 90s-00s will be remembered as the only period in the human history when the truly free unregulated GLOBAL internet was possible.<p>This view might look naive and hype-provoking and indeed the internet proved to be very robust on the big scale so far.

Assume that by ""star player"" we're not talking Micheal Jordan but merely somebody who is the best player on the team; having them in reserve in the last quarter means the other team can't simply deploy a strategy that is built on the coach not being able to put that player back out. A bad chess analogy would be facing the choice of retreating your queen back to your home ranks or getting her captured, there is strategic value in just having her back there even if she is not currently in a powerful position.

Arguably, that's the point of forming a society in the first place.<p>The stated reason for reducing current fluoridation levels has more to do with an increase in its availability from other sources. But this article is useless in furthering any meaningful discussion so far as it provides little more than unsubstantiated opinion.<p>It would be great to have a meaningful discussion on how we can balance the benefits to society and individual risks, including exactly where the statistical benefits afforded to a group outweigh the potential risks to individuals. But this article isn't it.<p>The broader issue touches on exactly how to frame the social contract between a government and its people - what rights are you prepared to give up, what responsibilities will you shoulder, and what risks are you prepared to accept, in order to benefit from the organization and protections afforded by your society?",1294606394

2086370,comment,2085892,2085892,0,0,cletus,,,"This article espouses a topic popular in most business schools today: they want to quantify (or simply pay lip service to) the idea of social responsibility. You will see all sorts of attention paid to this in most MBA programs today.<p>The idea isn't a new one and can trace its roots back to Marx and probably beyond. Marx argued that the workers should own the means of production [1]. That's simply a different take on creating ""shared value"".<p>But this article, as you'd expect from Harvard, is high on naive ideals. For example:<p><i>Not all profit is equal...</i><p>The premise is that corporations have a social responsibility. I view this as being like the idea of keeping tigers as house pets. You can change the <i>purpose</i> of a tiger to be a domesticated animal but at some point that tiger is going to snap your neck because, hey, that's what tigers do.<p>Of course tigers aren't inherently <i>bad</i>. The point is that tigers are really not suited for the purpose you have in mind.<p>Trying to colour corporations with morality is I think much the same. Capitalism works because corporations are amoral entities that simply respond to their environment. Add warm water to dry yeast and it grows. Add salt and it dies.<p>You control the actions of corporations not by making them <i>feel</i> something. You control them by treating them as yeast and adding warm water, salt or whatever is required.<p>To put it another way: you control corporations by controlling their <i>environment</i>.<p>Unless you're a pure capitalist you will recognize that there is some place for government intervention and regulation, not only for the good of the people but for the good of the corporations themselves.<p>Antitrust for example came about because companies were <i>too</i> successful. You can get an algae bloom in a river. The algae will eventually die out but only after killing virtually everything in the river and then starving.<p>In England the road system was nationalized (many years ago). In the US, the railroads were.<p>The difficulty lies in deciding exactly how much intervention is required.<p>Our current woes I think boil down to one thing: there is a mismatch between the interests of people and corporations and the interests of the politicians who decide what the intervention is. Corporations and people have to deal with consequences for a very long time. Politicians are often only concerned about what happens between now and the next election.<p>Of the things broken with the current system at the top would be (IMHO) the financial system. By this I primarily mean the Federal Reserve, the IMF and the World Bank.<p>The IMF and the Federal Reserve now have a role where they are basically welfare for investment bankers. You have seen crisis after crisis in recent years that largely stem from financial institutions having almost no aversion to risk. Why? Because we've trained them that way. If they ever get in any serious trouble, don't worry, we'll bail you out!<p>Likewise the IMF/World Bank continue to throw money at developing nations because, basically, they can never lose that money. A country can't declare bankruptcy like a person or corporation can.<p>Initiatives like HIPC [2] are misguided. The country already can't pay. All you're doing is paying bank the organizations that never should've lent them money to begin with.<p>It should also be noted that some of these loans end up funding war, revolution and even genocide as well as funding the personal fortune of corrupt dictators.<p>Back to capitalism: capitalism has been the engine that in less than 200 years has turned us from a largely agrarian existence to computers and putting man on the Moon, while increasing the standard of living of <i>billions</i> of people to levels unprecedented in human history.<p>So when I read something like this, I think it's just the latest fad from Ivory Tower MBA academics who seek to justify their existence in a world that is largely coming to the conclusion that the MBA itself is a destructive fad.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production#Marxist_analysis_of_ownership_of_MoP_within_capitalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production#Marxist_ana...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavily_Indebted_Poor_Countries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavily_Indebted_Poor_Countries</a>",1294606324

2086364,comment,2085880,2085880,0,0,eof,,,"I was a leading part of an unsuccessful campaign to get fluoride out of the water in a city in Vermont.<p>I went from having no idea about the issue to 'convinced' it shouldn't be in the water in an afternoon when I ran into someone (in my same city years before we tried to get it out again) petitioning on the street.<p>The super common sense easy argument is choice.  If you are dripping fluoride into the drinking water, you are effectively medicating a population without their consent.  I am not so poor as to not be able to buy filtered water and/or a reverse osmosis filtration system, but many families are.<p>Even if I am able, and choose, not to drink the city's water: the local bread I buy, I pasta I cook, virtually everything these days that uses water in its creation process also has fluoride.  That is why they are reducing it.. when the .7-1.2 ppm standard was made.. it was based  off the total daily dose assuming fluoride would only come from water.  It took 60 years to realize total dose is beyond just the tap water drink; the anti-fluoridationists have been saying this from the beginning.<p>There are a bunch of studies linking IQ drops to fluoride exposure.  Way before fluoride was a tooth decay miracle, it was an industrial hazard that had Aluminum plants being sued all over the place.  Fluoride played a key role in developing the nuclear bomb.  In two different ways, it is a fluoride-uranium gas that is run through huge ducts for many miles to slowly enrich uranium; it was fluorocarbons that were able to lubricate the machines that this gas went through (everything else would get eaten by the fluorine).<p>The negative health effects are not hard to find.  The only reason this is still a practice is because some powerful organizations reputations are at risk; and if instead of dripping what is literally the scrubber fluid from super-phosphate fertilizer plants into your water slowly, they would have to pay for hazardous waste disposal.<p>I could go on and on.  If you want a really good read, check out the Fluoride Deception.<p>The history is amazing.<p>Fluorosis is the moddling of the teeth by fluoride.  Fluoride 'works' by changing the mineral structure of your teeth.  The fluoro-apatite is more resistant to decay than hydroxy-apatite.  This is why fluoride toothpaste and fluoride gels make perfect sense.  They work.<p>When you ingest fluoride over long periods of time, the fluoride accumulates not just in your teeth, but in all of the places that have a similar chemical composition to your teeth, namely your bones.  If someone's teeth are moddeled you can be sure their bones are too.<p>Indeed, the highest concentrations of fluoride found in humans is not in the bones or the teeth at all, but the bits of calcium in the pineal gland; where it has been measured in the 10,000ppm range (this is due probably to a really high blood flow and large relative surface area).<p>Fluoride is super dirt cheap because it is literally an industrial waste.  I don't want to have to drink it.  They fight tooth and nail and call it conspiracy theorist when we suggest it is an outdated practice.",1294606129

But the first thing you see is that the ""Why Catalyst is an excellent web application framework?"" is an empty page.<p>The perl community has every reason to be proud of CPAN. It's great tool but it's not the answer to everything.

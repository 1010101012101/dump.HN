Taking aspirin for a headache IS the same as taking ADD drugs.<p>Having coffee specifically for the caffeine boost IS drug use.<p>What I am saying is that the rule of law doesn't matter, and as you suggest with the pot/booze example it is often backwards.  Booze is much deadlier and more dangerous for personal use than pot, no question when you consider lethal dose.<p>Legality of drugs would be a small afterthought if I considered taking something like ADD for concentration.  99% of the consideration would be my personal health and safety including long term side effects.",1207850398

160138,comment,159924,160099,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yes, I agree, but this is the argument that I tried to short-circuit.<p>How many freshmen in college are in the habit of listening to the BBC? How many have heard of Noam Chomsky in any context? How many have read so much as <i>one</i> book on history or politics, beyond high-school textbooks? Raise those numbers, and students will learn the trivia by themselves, just as your brain subconsciously learned trivia about the Balkans as a side effect of reading the Chomsky.<p>But the amount of trivia that students know is not, in itself, very important. Indeed, studies which show that ""most students don't know where Kosovo is on a map!!!"" can be dangerous because they misdiagnose the problem and lead to the wrong solution: Forcing students to memorize maps and regurgitate them on tests, a process which also convinces the students that geography teachers are sadists and geography is a torture device.",1207850125

160116,comment,159828,159828,0,0,procrastitron,,,"There's actually a common misconception about Scheme being lexically scoped only. You have to dig very deep into the Scheme literature to find it, but Scheme actually requires both dynamic and lexical scoping of variables depending upon the way they are defined.<p>Almost all variables in Scheme are lexically scoped, the exceptions are variables created by a ""(define ...)"" statement. The reason for this (which is spelled out in ""The Art of the Interpreter"") is to support defining recursive functions.<p>So, for instance, the following should work in pretty much any Scheme REPL:<p><pre><code>    > (define foo 1)\n    > (define (bar n) (+ foo n))\n    > (bar 2)\n    3\n    > (define foo 2)\n    > (bar 2)\n    4\n</code></pre>\nIf ""(define ...)"" statements actually created lexical variables, then both calls to ""bar"" would return the same result.",1207849286

We used to review applications printed out on paper, for example; now we have software for it.<p>We also have software for keeping track of all the startups, for communicating with them, and for generating all the documents for startups we fund.  We'd have ground to a halt by now without these apps.",1207846894

As a result, we don't place as much importance on rote memorization of daily events and occurrences.<p>While I can personally answer the questions, I do see the viewpoint from the people around me who look at the questions he was asking - ""Who else is a democracy?"" ""Who's the SoD?"" etc - and go ""Thats on Google/Wiki, why bother memorizing it when I can look it up just as quickly?"" And honestly? It's comforting in a way to know that I'm not going to have to remember random bits of information if it doesn't interest me.<p>Is it depressing? In a way. But its the modern world for millions of people and it's not about to change anytime soon.  Instead of giving an irate tirade on the issue, maybe it would be better for them to talk to the students and try to look at things from our point of view (grew up with technology and basically always connected) instead of the one they have/want us to have (technology is an aid to help us, not a crutch to rely on)",1207846813

He came to the U.S. alone when he was 11 years old and lived with strangers until he met my grandmother at a picnic.  They were married 3 weeks later.  He spoke 5 languages fluently, played 6 musical instruments, never went to school a single day in his life, and he could fix anything.<p>Like OP, one of my most favorite days of my childhood was when I was 12 and my grandfather took me to work with him.  I remember helping him carry his tools down the back steps and load them into the trunk of his Ford Galaxie 500.  He taught me my all time favorite cuss word when he said, ""Move all that shitcrap out of the way.""<p>Just the other day, I drove right past that spot, stopped, and sat for a while, remembering the good old days.

That is, does it still bother you if a writer uses 'will' where some very stuffy people would prefer (even insist on!) 'shall'? If not, why not? If so, why? Notice that no matter which way you jump on this, <i>you're already making choices</i>. What about 'nauseous' and 'nauseated'? Do you insist on that distinction in writing? How about in speech? Do you correct people who say 'can' instead of 'may'? How about 'less' and 'few'? Do you say 'your being here makes me happy' or 'you being here makes me happy'? There's always going to be room for <i>some</i> pedantic asshat to correct you. It's up to you, however, to pick the cases where you push back, or shrug, or accept the correction quietly (because you've had the fight too often). You also have to decide who you want to impress. If you carefully rearrange all sentences so that they don't end with a preposition, you may impress the grammar school teachers and the self-satisfied pedants of the world, but you will only look silly to the professors of Linguistics over at Language Log[1].<p>So it's not entirely good enough to say ""Just follow the arbitrary rules in order to demonstrate that you are a thoughtful, well-educated, intelligent person.""

The way this works is that you can always get a politicians to promise whatever to whomever, as long as it will get him reelected. Then it's up the the public company to constantly pursue quick successes (usually in the form of various prestige projects which includes hiring huge swaths of overpaid and unfireable employees) while neglecting long term planning and maintenance. When called out on it, they demand a larger operating budget, which if allocated, goes mostly towards making the allocating politician look good, and which if not, results in cuts to front line services to make the responsible politician look bad. This is called ""rent seeking"". Because the service is lousy, and the public, while not liking that, also isn't going to deliver the required landslide in an election, nothing happens. This is known as ""the reason large public companies too often become bloated ungovernable unreformable monsters"".",1305293841

If you copy my stuff, you benefit and I am unaffected. If I in return copy your stuff, we both lose nothing and end up with twice as much as we started with. That does not sound like taking property at all, in fact it sounds good!<p>That really ought to be enough to seriously undermine the illusion of IP . . .<p>First ask: why do we have property? which is as much as to ask: why is it moral? Property is not an axiom of morality, it must be justified. Even more clearly so with IP, since it invents a kind of restriction where there is none in physical fact.<p>Property is moral because it gives a group/community as a whole a good way of managing things. Property is good not because it gives to someone what is 'theirs', but because as a whole system, in aggregate, it is good for all.<p>(If we want a rational principal of morality, it is universalisation. Morals are codes of cooperation. They are justified as to how they affect some group. That is what is distinctive in moral rules: they are not rules for individual purpose, they are rules for all (if they do not suit all, why should all consent to them?).)<p>The Lockean proposition of copyright really only establishes attribution: it 'attaches' a particular thing to a particular creator/author.<p>But attribution alone does not justify anything much. I may have made a shovel, but that does not then give me a right to dig anyone and everyone's garden with it. Attribution of authorship is merely the 'location' of some possible rights; it is insufficient to set the limits of those rights on its own.<p>Locke understood this, which is why, when we look at the source of this argument, we find he clearly included the condition of ""at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others"". For a rule to be moral it must make sense more widely than for its primary participant. It must work overall for everyone. <i>That</i> is what sets the limits to rights.<p>'Abstract goods' (i.e. the subjects of copyright) are nonrival. They behave fundamentally differently to material things. Use by one person does not deny another. It means the tacit assumption that some restriction similar to normal property is implied immediately falters. And that puts an end to the Lockean 'argument'.<p>And if even that is not enough, reconsider from your own view: those proposed 'axioms' of morality. Either personal sovereignty and property rights are equal or, more likely, personal sovereignty has precedence. Well, IP imposes a direct physical restriction on others' personal freedom: telling someone they cannot copy something is telling them they cannot do as they please with themselves and <i>their</i> own property (and even though the IP 'owner' may be completely unaffected). Now either you have a deep conflict in those axioms or, more reasonably, IP must be overruled.<p>The only reasonable argument for IP is the orthodox economic one of supporting and sustaining a market. This is a pragmatic moral argument: one that is a matter of evidence and practicality, not of any kind of 'natural right'.",1305293217

In forums and email and texting, quotes are usually either blocked-off text, or the quotes are used to specifically emphasize an exact character string (often a single word).<p>Wikipedia is also generally not about narration, and quotes are usually meant to be exact.<p>With narration, the goal is not to convey exactness rather to tell a story.  Interrupting a character's quote to insert "", he said,"" influences the original meaning (if there even is such a thing) no matter where the punctuation lies.  But that's not important because specifying precisely what a character said usually isn't the point of a story.<p>Furthermore, if you write your own sentence, and finish with quote of an entire sentence, why isn't there a period for both sentences?

I think the issue is whether this leads to students being more or less likely to speak up in, for lack of a better term, real life. I can see it going either way.<p>It seems the more reliant we become on screen-to-screen text rather than face-to-face conversation, the less proficient we will be at face-to-face conversation. But at the same time, this could be a way to bring people out in the open and encourage them to get involved in all kinds of discussion, whether screen-to-screen or face-to-face.<p>I would be inclined to measure the results. Use the technology in one class but not in another. On the last day of class, don't use it in either class, and see which class has more face-to-face participation, the one that had to do it from the beginning or the one that got eased into it.<p>It's much harder though to measure the long-term consequences. If technology like this continues to become more and more pervasive, there may be no ""last day of class"" in which people are forced to speak up. The analogy to physical exertion is well warranted. It is now possible, because of technology, to live your entire life without engaging in strenuous physical activity. This was simply not the case even 50 years ago. In another 50 years, will it be possible to live your entire life without engaging in face-to-face conversation? If so, do we want that?",1305292316

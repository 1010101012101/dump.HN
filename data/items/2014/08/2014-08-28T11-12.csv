My wife spent a good part of the last year essentially bed ridden.  The US doctor performed test after test to find out what was wrong.  She eventually prescribed some medication for my wife which made her violently ill, but the doctor promised her body would acclimate to the medicine and that, in a few months, she&#x27;s be able to walk again.<p>Since coming to the UK, we&#x27;ve discovered that the battery of blood tests that were performed back in the USA was actually just the diabetes test being performed over and over again because the test kept coming back negative.  The medicine prescribed was actually a drug for the treatment of diabetics, despite the doctor having twelve negative blood tests on my wife for diabetes.<p>Instead, the UK doctor considered the possibility that there was something wrong with my wife besides just being fat.  After a week on her new medicine, she was starting to walk without a cane again.  In the past two months, she&#x27;s lost thirty pounds.  It&#x27;s amazing how much more exercise you can get when you&#x27;re not bedridden.  Next week, we&#x27;re seeing a GI doctor because the UK doctor realized that A) my wife would lose more weight if she ate more salad, B) my wife would eat more salad if she didn&#x27;t always violently vomit it back up six hours later, and C) regurgitating food eaten more than fours hours ago isn&#x27;t normal.  The doctors in the USA never could seem to figure out B and C, so they would just double down on A.<p>By the way, in case you think that it was just that one doctor, that&#x27;s not even our worst experience with it.  About a decade back, my wife went to the emergency room after getting stabbed.  The nurse told her the the problem would go away with diet and exercise.  A stab wound.

This makes the office inaccessible by public transport and much easier to get to by car. These are IT jobs in different industry sectors: retail, defence, finance, utilities etc.<p>I suppose this is due to the price of land and availability of office space out of town. There is no incentive for most of these companies to be in a city centre.<p>This is the major reason I&#x27;m likely to continue to drive to work. At the right time of day it takes 20 mins to drive, proabably over 1.5 hours by public transport - a mixture of train, bus, walk and much more expensive.

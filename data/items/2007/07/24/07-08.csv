36298,comment,36100,36100,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"4 of the five points are false. I can't comment on the personal network.<p>Cambridge's real advantages over the Bay Area are that the weather is bad and there isn't anything interesting to do (how many times can you go to 1369 or People's Republik?) <p>Given these constraints, you might as well work 18 hours a day. <p>San Francisco has the opposite problem. If I was yc I'd include a provision that the company has to be in San Mateo or some other boring peninsula/south bay hellhole, and not The City. There are simply too many distractions. I've never heard of a startup based in SF doing anywhere as well as the ones based in Silicon Valley proper. ",1185263362

First, you get the options.  Then, you vest into them.  Finally, you purchase the shares.  Until you purchase, the company still has them.\n",1185262191
36294,comment,36276,36276,0,0,waleedka,,,"That's a big step and it takes courage. Good for you. I like most of your plan, except for one point: Why the 4-month delay?  Study and a pet project!!! Doesn't seem like a high priority thing for someone who's betting his career on a startup. It sounds like an excuse to delay starting the hard work of a startup. Plus, I'm guessing that you'll be living off of your savings. If that's the case, then you have a limited time to do the try/fail cycle a few times before you have to get back to a full-time job. I think you should start right away, and you can do your study on the side.<p>Best of luck.",1185261819

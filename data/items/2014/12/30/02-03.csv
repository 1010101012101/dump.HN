8813048,comment,8802424,8804291,0,0,wutbrodo,,,"> I do think that only a very small portion of adblocking users wants to &quot;justify&quot; anything in this regard. Most just don&#x27;t want to see ads and skip the faulty and economically biased moral debate around it.<p>This is possibly true, but not particularly relevant, as my comment mentions that I&#x27;m talking specifically about those who _do_ engage in moral justification.  Among the people with whom I&#x27;ve talked about it, those who claim a moral justification are far more common than those who simply say &quot;I don&#x27;t like ads and I don&#x27;t care about creators not getting paid&quot;.  I would be surprised if there weren&#x27;t many HNers whose sample is similar to mine.<p>Tangentially but not importantly, I&#x27;m not convinced that only a small portion of users openly think &quot;yes I&#x27;m consuming a product without paying and I have no other justification other than &#x27;i dont want to pay&#x27; &quot;.  Part of the reason you see such contortions in an attempt at moral justification is because one can draw a pretty clear parallel to &quot;I would shoplift if I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get caught&quot;, with the only (somewhat dubious) distinction being differences in marginal cost.<p>Note that I have talked to people who have a moral stance on adblocking and piracy that _is_ consistent, but this is rare since it&#x27;s usually accompanied by a pretty radical stance along the lines of &quot;all information (music, art, writing, etc) should be completely free&quot;, which requires a pretty massive amount of philosophical baggage in terms of having a sense of how this affects the incentive to create said information.",1419907534

8813003,comment,8810799,8810799,0,0,userbinator,,,"I think that for beginners it&#x27;s far better to talk about the LZ-style algorithms first, since they are much easier to understand without requiring any discussion of probabilities and the associated maths; the idea of replacing repeated strings with a reference to them is very intuitive, and so is the implementation of an LZ compressor/decompressor. In fact, an in-memory LZ decompressor core can be written in less than two dozen bytes of x86 instructions, and can easily outperform the fastest Huffman decompressor.<p>When I was interested enough in compression to read about it, the majority of the information I could find seemed highly theoretical and made me think that Huffman was a good first step so I managed to write a simple static/dynamic Huffman compressor/decompressor, but that didn&#x27;t work so well. It was &quot;fast enough&quot;, but the compression ratio was disappointing. When I discovered LZ the difference was amazing: an <i>extremely</i> simple algorithm, requiring about an order of magnitude less code in implementation, that compressed much better than Huffman for data which would intuitively be compressible.<p>In retrospect, it&#x27;s quite clear that Huffman and other &quot;variable length code&quot; techniques only work because of nonuniformity in symbol probabilities, so it is ineffective on data containing repeating patterns but uniform probability. E.g. take a string 256 bytes long containing all the byte values 0, 1, 2, ... 253, 254, 255; and repeat that string multiple times in a file. LZ can easily compress that pattern but Huffman can&#x27;t. (Does LZ rely on probability nonuniformity? It doesn&#x27;t look like it.) The fact that many common methods like FLATE use Huffman only to compress the output of LZ on their input probably reflects this, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen such an intuitive explanation for it before.",1419906626

At 12m (40ft) for a ground based radar (pulled that out of my arse, just for an example) the horizon is at 12.4km.<p>Then we discuss things like the Clutter Zone, which is a big issue for ground based radar systems. Planes and helicopters can fly Nap-of-the-Earth - below about 500ft is the usual stated height - because everything from buildings to wind over 15mph can make it unreliable for ground based systems.<p>An elevated system eliminates most of these problems, and this system has a radar horizon that covers all water and land from DC out to the Atlantic coast.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of areas where a submarine could launch from unnoticed, and I&#x27;m guessing trying to detect a sub in busy waters is a lot harder and less reliable than a radar system to target a missile launch and try to take down a short range ICBM.",1419905001

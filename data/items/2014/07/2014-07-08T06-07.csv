8003315,comment,7996464,7997968,1,0,hardwaresofton,,,"Machine readability, unless I and the dictionary are mistaken, is related to whether or not you can input the data from some physical medium into a computer. It&#x27;s not the same as asking whether something you read in makes sense, or is easy to parse, or is well-structured, which is what their idea is related to.<p>Other than the fact that most of the things I noted are ALREADY in a state that is computer usable (whether it makes sense to humans looking at computers is another question), I was trying to point out that getting the information into a computer (A.K.A. Machine readability) is not the issue we&#x27;re struggling with now, it&#x27;s structuring, characterizing and understanding the information.<p>I mentioned OCR because it&#x27;s used to parse resumes to find important bits when other methods fail (or someone submits something crazy like a scanned version of their resume instead of the file) -- something that wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if there was a standard (like is being proposed) to adhere to, that people could semantically find what they wanted from.<p>Also, if you read closely, I said with the state of OCR AND OTHER METHODS... OCR does not have anything to do with the machine readability of other methods, it&#x27;s just one method people use to extract data, or for machines to &quot;read&quot; the document.",1404802653

8003300,comment,8002494,8003030,1,0,btown,,,"Ignoring blips like Google&#x27;s current bender of destruction of advertising revenue streams for small labels, I can see larger labels becoming a thing of the past. What is the purpose of a label in the digital age, now that it can no longer include physical manufacturing and physical distribution in its value proposition? To consumers, it&#x27;s quickly becoming no more than a guarantee that associated artists are curated and are of &quot;high enough&quot; quality to the ears and eyes of some hidden tastemaker. And to producers, they&#x27;re increasingly a glorified PR firm. The largest labels&#x27; business models don&#x27;t match up with these value propositions; they function as gatekeepers in an age where unlocked gates are plentiful. This is not to say that all labels will disappear; smaller, niche labels such as Monstercat, Neon Gold, and even Roadrunner Records (in the 90s) function[ed] like well-branded aggregators, exactly meeting those needs and having a well-defined target audience. Perhaps we&#x27;ll see small labels turn to subscription models, allowing access to exclusive content from their members? Imagine iTunes with tons of small label-run channels one could subscribe to for a monthly fee, and get access to all the music within? Lots of chicken-egg problems here, but it&#x27;s interesting to think about.",1404802237

Broadly, the only tool to do this is to &quot;print money&quot;; read: lower interest rates, twiddle with the reserve ratio requirement, directly pay off banks for certain types of activities.</i><p>As I have understood demand-side economics, one additional difference to supply-side views is the source of the demand: demand-siders do not only see business investments as the source of demand, but also private consumption. To support that, wages have to rise (as is happening in China). I think that partly explains the currently active basic income discourse in Europe and the US and the introduction of minimum wage in Germany (done by a coalition of center and right parties!). Both instruments would directly benefit the poorer half of the population, who has a low to non-existant savings ratio (in Germany the &quot;poorer&quot; 60% of the population hold only 3% of the privately-held wealth). Increasing wages for these classes would immediately result in more demand.",1404802130

8003265,comment,8001337,8001770,2,0,pmontra,,,"Ruby is perhaps more dominant than Python in web development. Not that Rails is necessarily better than Django, but it seems there are more Rails developers than Django ones. However Ruby seems to be pretty much confined to web development and deployment tools. It also makes great DSLs thanks to its block syntax. However in general Python is more popular than Ruby.<p>One reason is that Python is used for system programming (e.g: the Linux apt system), desktop applications, big data (thanks to numpy) so you might find it a better investment for general purpose software development.<p>Another reason, which maybe explains the first one, is that Python looks more similar to C++/Java. Basically it&#x27;s a simplification of those languages (the {} pair traded for a single colon, no type declarations, etc) plus some handy shortcuts.\nRuby is from a somewhat different lineage (Smalltalk) and it shows in many places (e.g. the do |variable| ... end blocks). It can be used to write more natural language looking programs and combining that with some metaprogramming sometimes both amazes and unsettles programmers that come close to the language for the first time.<p>I suggest that you learn a little of both of them, working on the problem you want to solve, and decide by gut feeling what you would like to work with. I went the Ruby way because I can&#x27;t stand some of the syntax of Python, not that Ruby is perfect.",1404801022

One of the other considerations that I think helped give Python the edge was its simplicity, in that it can be &#x27;programming for non-programmers&#x27; and helps a lot of newcomers meet the simple scripting requirements they have without needing to understand more complex programming concepts.<p>Secondly, it makes for an easy transition from Python to Matlab, and Matlab is used a fair bit throughout UQ&#x27;s Mechanical and Mechatronics departments. They both share very similar syntax (the major issue for most mech engineers, who deal with little more than loops, is that Python is 0-indexed whereas Matlab is 1-indexed).<p>The above makes Python a great introductory langauge for non-programmer beginners like mech engineers. It is ridiculously simple and human-readable, and when you&#x27;re outside an IT/EE department then you don&#x27;t end up spending excess time explaining the quirks of a language to those who will never care for it. On the other hand, it still gives more than enough rope for those that do end up wanting to run with it and they can end up doing some pretty fancy stuff with it.<p>Does Monash align there in that it&#x27;s used in the non-IT related technical degrees?",1404800665

This round is over now (judge is already declaring it moot, although I don&#x27;t know why, did they just let a temporary order expire? There&#x27;s not a lot readable on the docket yet).<p>Importantly, No-IP now may have a clear shot at a pretty vicious countersuit, because what MS requested in their TRO (which has not been continued ahead of the hearing on... Thursday? I can&#x27;t read US dates well...) caused them, and their customers and the internet at large, <i>damages</i> - serious, huge, actual reputational damages with people moving away from their service which thrives on high uptime and reliability. They had no opportunity to answer the case against them - the action MS requested the court make against them was unilateral, which is... unusual.<p>MS will probably try to climb down in the most graceful manner they can, and settle out of court. However, No-IP will not want to accept a token settlement for MS <i>destroying their business</i>: on the face of it, they have a very strong case and I doubt MS will be able to offer enough to compensate their ire, so we&#x27;ll probably see a countersuit instead, and - speculation - it&#x27;ll probably not go well for MS <i>at all</i>, unless they have hard evidence that No-IP were <i>actively complicit</i> in abusive activity, which <i>seems</i> to have been what they (mis?)represented to the court in their TRO application (but we&#x27;re missing that particular piece of the jigsaw, because it was sealed; and again, it shouldn&#x27;t have been sealed). If MS had that, however, I speculate they wouldn&#x27;t have dropped the TRO ahead of the hearing, and that prospect, shall we say, <i>seems unlikely</i> overall compared to the prospect of them making <i>a huge mistake</i>.<p>Huge company attacking small business - that&#x27;s a powerful angle.

I actually expect it to be de-listed as moot and the action dropped until No-IP countersue, and they could take their time on that - in fact, they might want statistics of how many of their customers jumped ship on having their domains down for several days at MS&#x27;s whim.

I&#x27;d rather see trends than raw numbers - the fact that python has grown quickly over the last decade in terms of adoption is more interesting than it being &quot;the top,&quot; to me.<p>3. It is sad that Java still has such a stronghold both in terms of being the intro language and being on the College Board curriculum. It is not the right language for beginners, or, really, anyone.<p>4. While I didn&#x27;t take &quot;CS1&quot; in college (thanks AP exam) - I did take CS2 or whatever, and it was taught in scheme with SICP. Scheme was the great equalizer in that it was unlike any language anyone in the class had ever seen and that syntax no longer mattered - only concepts did. I hope it continues to keep its place in second-level courses.<p>5. It is unfortunate that garbage collected languages are extremely highly represented on this list - memory management may be unpleasant, but acknowledging that we are programming on limited-resource devices should be acknowledged early and often. Forcing students to experience this first hand seems that it serves both the purpose of teaching them abstraction (isn&#x27;t this garbage collector great!) while maintaining a respect for the fact that resources (cpu, memory, power, network, disk, etc.) aren&#x27;t free.",1404799520
8003201,comment,8001337,8001832,2,0,pmontra,,,"Thank you for that link. I finally understood why Guido added the colon before an indented block (second paragraph). It&#x27;s not needed by the parser, it&#x27;s only to make it easy for programmers to understand that a block is about to start. Actually: &quot;after early user testing without the colon, it was discovered that the meaning of the indentation was unclear to beginners&quot;. So it&#x27;s aimed to <i>beginner programmers</i>. That&#x27;s why Guido inflicted that useless and silly looking colon to all of us. How about making it optional in future?",1404799515

My lenses arrived today (10 days after my order, which is probably pretty decent) but I only got one of each, not two sets.  OK, this was probably my screw-up, but I definitely knew what I needed and remember trying to tweak quantities on my order to get this right.  This <i>is</i> probably my screwup but part of me wishes that it wasn&#x27;t so easy to screwup online retail (yes, by the customer) like this.<p>But my bigger worry is this!  Now that I&#x27;ve got two individual, unpaired lenses, tonight I&#x27;m going back to place a new order.  I didn&#x27;t create an account with my original order so I&#x27;m checking out again and choosing the &quot;don&#x27;t create an account&quot; option again when the site tells me I have an account.  That&#x27;s weird because I definitely know I didn&#x27;t choose to create an account.  But I can&#x27;t check out in without signing in, so I try using the password generation routine I&#x27;ve been using for years.  That doesn&#x27;t work, so I ask it to email me my password and the email I receive tells me my password is &quot;optics&quot;.<p>1) For obvious reasons, it&#x27;s really, really, really bad to send a username and password together in an email (my username happened to be my email, but the body of the message makes this explicit, too)\n2) I definitely did not create that account or with that password - this seems to have generated one &quot;for&quot; me\n3) In doing so, it used a really insecure password and I suspect that same default password is in place for other accounts that have been generated automatically and without consent on the site.<p>I don&#x27;t really mean to come slam these guys and their site - it seems like a bit of a mom & pop shop for some specialized equipment - but others who&#x27;ve placed an order here should beware.",1404799397

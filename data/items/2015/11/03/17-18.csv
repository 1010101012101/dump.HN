(Granted, his passing was natural, but he campaigned eloquently for the right to make such a choice.)<p>I also knew someone who suffered great pain on a daily basis, and I have a hard time considering his suicide irrational.  I knew a guy (a friend of a friend) who, through foolishness in his youth, ruptured three of his spinal discs, and had damaged two other ones. He was in constant excruciating pain.  In the trailing decade of his life, he could not get sufficient pain relief to hold a job, could not get/afford treatment because of that, and basically was in a pain-filled hell, as he put it.  At some point, after he&#x27;d been in near-constant excruciating pain for twenty years, he decided he no longer wanted to live.<p>I don&#x27;t think either of these men were mentally ill, or making irrational choices.",1446573573

They did this because they were confronted with stagflation, oil crises, labor militancy, and a crisis of corporate profitability, and they naively believed that deflationary depressions were a solved problem.<p>They succeeded, and today&#x27;s economy is their program of governance gone horribly right.",1446573390

How will I know that the market will scale - ie I didn&#x27;t just find a fluke set of eager prospects?<p>I was going to contact places via Facebook initially (so I can somewhat gauge their business size based upon the # of fans) and simply ask if anyone&#x27;s asked about prepared meal services and if they&#x27;ve would consider using an online ordering system. Might it be worth at this point saying that I&#x27;m merely doing research (and need to get enough validation before I work on it further)? Would it be reasonable that those who actually DO validate my hypothesis would consider being customers?<p>I&#x27;m a bit vague on the value statement (my hypotheses on the convenience may be overrated) so how do I go about developing a better value statement, based on interviewing people in the industry? It could be that customers ordering extra takeout is good enough for most places and want the instant gratification of picking up same day. Prepared meal services is a bit different model as people usually order 3-4 days in advance and only pick up once a week (unlike takeout orders). The advantage to the business is they can take a list of orders and prepare the food in batches more efficiently (efficiency/prep is key for any food service business) and that they&#x27;d have subscriptions (meal plans) which would bring in residual income from those committed to ordering.<p>Should I search for similar businesses who already HAVE this type of service (whether online or offline ordering) and ask what they gained from it and what their overall experience has been like (ie positive/mixed) and ultimately what they&#x27;ve learned and would recommend to any places looking to add this service.",1446572429

I did a static site generator in good ol&#x27; Perl 5 in the 90s – and I&#x27;m sure, I wasn&#x27;t the only one to do this. (Everything was based on file hierarchies, but there wasn&#x27;t much structure or setup required else. Directories were mangled to intermediate data files in pseudo-XML, only to be reassembled, when there was an update local to that hierarchy. XML wasn&#x27;t the big thing then, but as this had to mangle HTML anyway, it was somewhat obvious to embed data structures in tags.)<p>Back then, this really had some advantages: Updates were rare, but views comparably frequent, while databases were either not that performant or quite expensive. This way, you could serve everything from cache (remember Squid?), and, compared to a dynamic site, it was really quick, even in admin-mode. Given the modern machines and the lots of memory they come with, it&#x27;s quite ironic to see this come back, while we saw the triumph of the LAMP stack on comparably modest machines. Nevertheless, if you&#x27;ve only a few updates and lots of views, it&#x27;s a good idea towards green computing. (Save some mountaintops! [1])<p>On the other hand, there is some &quot;magical&quot; limit regarding flexibility and complexity, where things tend soon towards unmaintainable code.

Meanwhile every institution I list above was too big to fail but would never have been covered by Glass-Steagall--not to mention Fannie and Freddie.<p>Edit to add: IMO &quot;Glass-Steagall&quot; has become political shorthand, a sort of litmus test to see if people are for or against big banks that socialize risk and privatize profits. But G-S was a real law that was rather limited in scope. If we fail to understand the detailed realities of the financial meltdown, we will fail to prevent the next one.",1446571964

10501044,comment,10500087,10500087,0,0,mdip,,,"The best times in my career were shortly after I started out and right now.  The worst were several parts in the middle.<p>In the beginning I had started out at a telecom that was quite stable (around 1997).  I was 19, it was my first &quot;real job&quot; with a paycheck good enough for me to live comfortably on my own.  Within a year I went from lower-level support work to back-end support.  The market my company was in was disrupted, causing bankruptcy in 2001.  This was still a great time.  When something like this happens, the company survives on the best members of its staff and I was that guy -- I quickly filled in gaps and started in software development (where my passion was anyway).<p>Over time, this led to my worst periods.  The demands for the job grew, but my salary and frequency of interesting projects did not (except for a brief period in 2008).  Every 6 months the company shrank taking with it a majority of the great people I worked with (most leaving on their own due to the environment).  Coming in to work every day amidst the terrible moral was taxing.<p>I left that job last year though I wouldn&#x27;t say that my work ethic has changed.  I never let the bad things get me down -- ultimately, I have this job to support my family and that&#x27;s motivation enough to do the best work I am capable of.  But that has a cost.  Every day I&#x27;d drag myself out of bed, start work, and when finished I&#x27;d be &quot;spent&quot;.  My performance at work didn&#x27;t change, but I can now admit that my performance in everything outside of work suffered greatly to the extent of it being one of the reasons I am now divorced.<p>I&#x27;m now back on track.  At my new job I work with and for excellent people -- people who truly love the work and the company they work for.  I fly out of bed at 5:00-5:30 AM excited to work (so excited, in fact, that I use it as motivation to get a morning run in ... &quot;I can start working as soon as I eat breakfast and run around the block&quot; ... it&#x27;s weird to use &quot;starting work&quot; as a reward for doing something I don&#x27;t want to do).  It helps that this place is both a good fit for my skillset and a great place to expand it.  I&#x27;m a passionate learner and need a job that keeps things interesting and new.<p>My personal lesson in all of this is &quot;If you can help it, don&#x27;t keep a job that doesn&#x27;t value you&quot;.  If you work in software development today and you&#x27;re any good (heck, even if your not from what I&#x27;ve seen) there are few good reasons to stay at a lousy employer for very long.  I had no excuses. I stayed 3 more years than I should have, maybe more.  Loss aversion and fear that I wouldn&#x27;t find a job as good as I had were paralyzing for me.  This was powerful enough to keep me from even getting my resume together and looking.  Once I began looking, I discovered that despite the lousy local economy, there were endless choices available to me so I took the one that fit best with my circumstances.  The end result is that I no longer finish the day &quot;spent&quot;.  I&#x27;ve managed -- using the 8 or so hours I can devote to it on the weekend -- to complete 5 personal projects, 3 released open-source.  When I talk about what I do, those are the things I tend to mention first -- they are mine, and a direct result of mt overall happiness.",1446571886

One of my chemistry teachers in high school made a lab where we had to identify various substances by smell. H2S was one of those substances, and we were told it had a distinctive sulfuric smell.<p>I remember trying to smell the substance by wafting[0] (as previous teachers had instructed us) and thinking &#x27;hm, I thought I smelled that a second ago, but now I can&#x27;t&#x27;. My teacher&#x27;s response was &#x27;oh, you&#x27;re just not smelling it hard enough. You really need to take a big sniff&#x27; and stuck his nose over the petri dish to demonstrate.<p>Fortunately I was skeptical enough of him by this point in the semester that I ignored him. Only later did I look it up and discover that H2S is not actually odorless - it smell like rotten eggs. But it <i>also</i> dulls your sense of smell at the same time[1].<p>This is only one of several times when he almost killed us with labs in that class (my favorite was when he came just a second away from lighting a classmate on fire with Thermite[2]).<p>I&#x27;m really glad I&#x27;m not in high school anymore.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQis0nnap74"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQis0nnap74</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide#Safety"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide#Safety</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite</a>",1446571704

The difference is that a database can do a JOIN but a file system can&#x27;t (directory traversals really aren&#x27;t equivalent).  In that case any such logic would have to  be in the client-side JS, fetching objects and quite likely imposing even more load than an SQL query would have.  Being able to shut down that database process is good in a lot of ways (especially security) but reduced total load isn&#x27;t necessarily one of them.  You might just be shifting load to the the web server and file system.  That&#x27;s why I said the <i>generator</i> part is as important as the static part.

You can only grow an economy when people are building useful things of all kinds, doing useful things for each other, and creating new businesses.<p>The big problem in the US isn&#x27;t capitalism as such, it&#x27;s the fact that there&#x27;s a layer of old and new money privilege accreted around Wall St and Washington. It&#x27;s such a resource sink it has literally locked out most of the rest of the population.<p>It&#x27;s a networking and patronage problem.

10500983,comment,10499434,10499830,0,0,zeidrich,,,"I think it&#x27;s a big challenge of culture.  Substance abuse is a problem that becomes a symptom.   Part of the issue I think is cultural ideas about mental health.  American culture is strongly focused on good and bad, strength of will and weakness,  and where to place blame.  Both the person with the addiction and the rest of society are affected by this culture.<p>When you become addicted to a substance, it&#x27;s like it becomes revealed to society that you&#x27;re a weak person.  Like weakness is part of your identity.  A good person is strong, a good person has the strength of will to not abuse substances.  You&#x27;re not a good person.<p>When you look back at your life, you see the same faults and have the same regrets. You think of yourself as a weak person.<p>The problem with those sorts of ideas is they reinforce the behavior that leads to things like substance abuse.  They isolate you, they make you lose motivation, they make you act in a self destructive manner because you think you are the kind of person who should.<p>These are cultural elements that are present everywhere but relatively stronger in American culture.  It really likes to put people into boxes, quite literally. People who commit a crime are considered criminals.  The crime can be pretty minor, but maybe it sends you to jail. Criminals are bad, and people who go to jail are bad. Good people won&#x27;t interact with bad people. You can lose your job, you can lose the ability to find another, you can lose your home, you can lose your ability to find another.  But good people don&#x27;t care, bad people go to jail.  Bad people need to be punished.  Bad people don&#x27;t deserve our attention. Bad people don&#x27;t deserve our money.<p>Other cultures are a bit less polarized.  The need to brand someone good or bad isn&#x27;t as strong. If you commit a crime, you go to jail, but you&#x27;re treated like a person, you&#x27;re given opportunities to correct some of the issues that sent you there, you&#x27;re released in a manner that tries to help integrate you into the rest of society.  American culture sees things like this and gets very angry.  How dare you spend MY tax dollars on feeding THOSE bad people nice food, and give them comfortable beds!? How dare you help bad people fix their problems when good people fix their problems themselves?<p>A person who abuses substances needs to be helped.  It&#x27;s a problem that is self-reinforcing and really need some external support to break.  The issue is that to ask for help identifies you as weak. It lets out the &quot;secret&quot; that you&#x27;re not good enough, you don&#x27;t have that imaginary &quot;indomitable will&quot; that good people have that keep them from doing bad things. The person feels this and is afraid to ask, and society feels this and will punish you for doing so.<p>It&#x27;s like how mental health issues, like suicide attempts can go into your police file and keep you from being allowed to cross the border.  These sorts of cultural impacts cause people to be afraid to look for help, and not just be afraid, but be punished for looking for help.<p>I think for the person in that situation, there&#x27;s very little you can do to change the rest of society.  But I think you can change your own mind, and I don&#x27;t mean you can buck up and use that indomitable will to shrug off your addiction.  I mean, you can recognize that you aren&#x27;t a bad person or a weak person.  You&#x27;re not significantly different than your neighbor, it&#x27;s just that you had a different set of circumstances 30-40 years ago and ended up learning a different set of habits and coping behavior.  Had they been exposed to the same things and presented the same circumstances, they could be in your shoes.<p>You can identify the small things in life that are important, and you can look towards what is needed to make your life a bit more like that.  It doesn&#x27;t even have to be getting rid of your addiction, it could be that you want to keep your home tidy, it could be that you want to eat breakfast in the morning, it could be that you want to get in shape, it could be that you like to read Stephen King novels, it could be that you want to spend time with a friend.  And you can do little things to move that forward.  You can throw a couple of things off the counter into the garbage, you can get a dozen eggs for breakfast tomorrow, you could take a walk around the block, you could read a chapter, you could chat with a friend for a few minutes.<p>It&#x27;s a matter of not believing the lie that you&#x27;re any better or worse.  You&#x27;re a person who does some things. You&#x27;ve done some hurtful things, but at this point you can only do things now. You aren&#x27;t a bad person, you aren&#x27;t a good person.  You&#x27;re a person who can do things.  And while society can limit their interactions with you because of their own mindset, you still have a lot of latitude to do many things despite that.<p>You&#x27;re judged by your lifestyle.  Yeah, that&#x27;s unfortunate.  But you can still clean your house, get up early and go for a run, eat some breakfast, read your favorite books and chat with your friends after work.  The unfortunate part is that even if you &quot;get your life back together&quot; people&#x27;s mindset might never change and think about the fact that people aren&#x27;t strictly good or bad.  It&#x27;s more likely they&#x27;ll just think you&#x27;ve changed and now you&#x27;re good.<p>But maybe you will have learned that, and that&#x27;s something.",1446571404

It&#x27;s much better, for much the same reasons as stated in the article.<p>Particularly stronger typing is useful. Code that uses the Any object (or Object if you&#x27;re in c#) tends to look horrible and have runtime errors, or it (what class it really is) has to occur to you as you&#x27;re coding, which sadly doesn&#x27;t happen 100% of the time for me.<p>I also find it&#x27;s easier to not do [obj msg] everywhere.

Pol Pot killed 2 million of his own people as a &quot;social engineering&quot; experiment (after studying Rousseau).  Mao killed 45 million in 4 years.  Can anyone say &quot;massive human suffering and political failure&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s true that the Post-Soviet states have had mixed results, based upon which have privatized industry and enacted pro-freedom policies, and also based upon which people retained trace Enlightenment notions of the government&#x27;s relationship to its citizenry.  Estonia, for example, has flourished: &quot;The foundation was laid in 1992 when Mart Laar, Estonia’s prime minister at the time, defibrillated the flat-lining economy. In less than two years his young government (average age: 35) gave Estonia a flat income-tax, free trade, sound money and privatisation. New businesses could be registered smoothly and without delays, an important spur for geeks lying in wait.&quot;[1]  In Russia, a heavy-industrial and resource-based country (partly thanks to Stalin&#x27;s 5-year-plans and massive capital theft from the Eastern Bloc countries), former Communist officials assumed ownership of state assets during the transition, and it predictably has not done as well.<p>Again, we can argue that liberalization has not occurred to a great extent in countries such as Russia, where a strongman still rules.  (It&#x27;s probably the case that places with massive natural resources have had greater struggles, as there was probably better opportunity for collusion by the political oligopoly.  Less resource-rich countries have on-average fared better.)  We can have an intelligent discussion comparing each of those countries based on the different policies they have enacted.  However, to drop historical context of life (and death) during the Soviet era is completely ludicrous.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_Communist_regimes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_Communist_...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/07/economist-explains-21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/07/ec...</a>",1446570986

I like Haskell, but there&#x27;s absolutely no reason why you ought to expect people to start using it when you&#x27;ve got much richer, usable ecosystems available out of the box. History keeps repeating itself. What makes or breaks a language isn&#x27;t just the language itself. A language needs a supporting ecosystem to actually make it useful. Of course, it&#x27;s a bit of a Catch-22: you need people to populate the ecosystem with code. So why don&#x27;t we start with a leiningen for Haskell? Time and again, the forums reinforce that the basic tools are what keep them from treating Haskell seriously.",1446570048

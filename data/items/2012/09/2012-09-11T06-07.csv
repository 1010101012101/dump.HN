Shortcomings which go beyond defaults and shortcuts.<p>- Many applications are designed with a floating environment in mind, and as a result simply translate very poorly to a tiling environment.<p>- If I'm working with more than three or four windows (which is common) I've basically got my active window and a stack of non-active, tiny, non-useable windows. In other words, it becomes difficult to combine even a medium-size set of windows with a usage model wherein I wish to interact with 2-3 medium size windows simultaneously.<p>- Often in a floating environment, I can overlap windows, maximizing utilized screen space by covering up unimportant parts of a certain window.<p>There are basically two reasons I keep using a tiling WM. First, it does pretty well with term emulators. Second, the existence of tabbed term emulators. The ability to spawn and destroy tabs on a whim without changing the screen layout really helps with my thought flow. If I was really a purist I'd be using GNU screen for that, but at that point what am I doing in X11 anyway?",1347345853

It's why the Sunni merchant class in Aleppo supported Assad just about to the point he started dropping bombs on their houses. Real change in America would mean short term strife and uncertainty, even if it vastly improves long term prospects, and there's always the risk that the attempt will fail and things will end up worse than before. That's not a trade that well-off people are historically keen to make, so they stick with the devils they know, quibbling over their relatively minor differences.

Soon as I started getting likes on a newsfeed as trivial as this, I decided to simply delete the post (and of course not 'Hide from Timeline'.) What happened next was that the likes kept pouring in, I kept getting the notifications, but clicking on the notifications led me to the Facebook 404 page. I asked my room mate to check if he can see this from his newsfeed and yes, it was there for him to see and like (and comment on!)

As with most things, there is no right answer, but here's a starting point:<p>If you are sitting here thinking ""I need some goals. What are some good goals for me?"" then you should start by thinking about the things you are good at and the things you enjoy and finding the intersection. Alternatively you can think about things you think you might enjoy that would require learning new skills, or things you might not enjoy as much that could be useful in your life.<p>Once you have a topic, or a pre-existing non-motivating ""do your best"" goal, there are a few situations:<p>1) If you're a complete beginner and need help figuring out what a good project could be, I discussed some some thoughts in a previous post [1]:<p><pre><code>  Good beginner projects tend to be more or less copies of things people have done before.
</code></pre>
I also recommend reading a how-to book and asking more knowledgeable friends for advice.<p>2) If you know somewhat more about the topic and you're struggling to get a different, more motivating perspective on a goal, I recommend doing what physicists usually do: putting the hard problem in the context of an even larger problem. To do this, ask <i>why</i> you want to accomplish the goal you're contemplating. (If you don't know why, go to step 1, or maybe you shouldn't be doing it.) I gave an example in the post of moving from ""I should work out because that's a good thing to do"" to the meta-goal of ""I want to look good for beach season."" Or you could move from ""I want to learn to program because that's a good thing to do"" to ""I want to build Ticketmaster for my school"" (for example).<p>3) If you just know you're interested in a general topic and are looking for ideas, I have so much to say about this it needs a separate blog post. This is definitely the best place to be.<p>What other characteristics make a useful goal? Also a topic for another post, but you can probably guess by now that I think one good baseline is whether you know specifically <i>why</i> you're doing it (beyond ""it sounds like a good idea"") and whether it is measurable enough that you can proudly tell someone specifically what you've accomplished.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.isaacsukin.com/news/2012/08/i-want-learn-programming-how-should-i-start"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isaacsukin.com/news/2012/08/i-want-learn-programm...</a>",1347343868

If you broke the build, you fix the build is all the process a company needs.</i><p>This is a little over-simplistic, IMO. There's more to correctness and good code than ""it didn't break the build."" I've been there and got the T-shirt from an organization with that mindset and their code, five or more years after it's written, was terrifying in a lot of ways, because hey--none of it broke the build. I get that you probably have had run-ins with <i>bad</i> process, but that doesn't make all process bad.<p>I'm a big fan of Gerrit, personally; it encourages multiple sets of eyes on the code and I really like the ""gatekeeper"" approach to master. If I can't use Gerrit (and there are good reasons for not using it, often related just to development team size--Gerrit doesn't seem worthwhile for under, say, 20 devs), my personal preference is a riff off of git-flow; developers only push to develop-staging and CI constantly pulls changes from develop, builds, runs tests, and pushes to develop. Nobody other than the CI user (which anyone can log in as, but unless something's broken, you never would) can push to develop. This process (scary word!) allows us to say with authority ""the build will never be broken when you pull from develop,"" and to me that has a lot of value--more and more as you add developers.",1347343406

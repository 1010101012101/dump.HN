168405,comment,167951,167951,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"My first thought was how much this sounds like ""All my friends are using Facebook while I secretly am using Ning.""  A social network's not very helpful if you're the only one on there. ;-)<p>But the network effects are far different for app developers than for users. Good luck, let us know how it goes!",1208681636

To see all the talks on justin.tv, go to the hackterv channel archive: <a href=""http://www.justin.tv/hackertv/archive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/hackertv/archive</a><p>The full day's video is broken up into segments and the beginning of a lot of talks are missing. Almost all of David Lawee's talk is missing.<p>I was too sick to go, even though I got accepted, so having this video is some solace. Thanks justin.tv.<p>Looking forward to the omnisio version to fill in the gaps.",1208681253

However, I'll gladly send them to anyone who would like to do it. I can host the video files and add them to the Startup School podcast feed on FeedBurner. Email me at matt.jaynes@gmail.com if interested!",1208681069

I have.  There's a reason Trac was written.<p>Follow the docs and it works right.  People who don't follow the instructions manage to fuck it up, but what else is new?",1208680825

168396,comment,165276,167396,0,0,projectileboy,,,"I'll give you that ""failed an IQ test"" seems a bit harsh. But when did all this occur? 2005, or later? If later, there's been so much written on the web about this that it seems amazing to me that you would have been shocked by the offer.<p>To the second point, I agree with you that an assembly line style makes individual negotiations impossible. But I'd say two things: (a) that's a feature, not a bug, and (b) if you're a young founder with no track record, exactly what are your other options?",1208680228

Coming from outside the valley, it's a little harder to get access to learn from such high-profile people.<p>I had a wonderful time connecting with different people and hearing their stories and startups. Good luck to everyone I talked to that have YC interviews!<p>Thanks again YCombinator and everyone who made it possible. I had a great time and learned a lot.",1208680078

168392,comment,168127,168156,0,0,condor,,,"I think you've missed the point.  The point is not to settle for the middle, the point is that there are real everyday problems that need solving, and there's real success that can naturally come from solving those problems, overtime.  You can't force success or simply will it.<p>I appreciated how he positioned ""startups"" in the same realm as other ""regular"" businesses; that's a very honest view because at the end of the day every business (tech startup or Italian restaurant) is judged by the profits they generate by creating value for their customers.  Thats what a business does, 1 + 1 = 3, adding valuing.   As a business owner you can't escape that law of commerce and expect to survive.   Tech startups aren't a special class of business in and of themselves that deserve to be valued higher than other businesses, they're only special if they can grow more efficiently and operate at a higher margin than other businesses.",1208679597

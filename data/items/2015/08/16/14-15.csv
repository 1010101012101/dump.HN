So when companies like Sparkfun and Adafruit were starting out they simply followed best design practices and fudged a little on the FCC side of things by saying that their products fell under one of the exceptions or that they use a pre-certified module.

This document is comparing dask to spark.  dask.dataframe is a relatively small part of dask.<p>>> &quot;Dask gives up high-level understanding to allow users to express more complex parallel algorithms.&quot;<p>> I don&#x27;t think this is true.

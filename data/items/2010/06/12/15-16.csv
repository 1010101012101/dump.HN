I've worked out a business model and run it by about 5 potential users. Each of them was confident that the 'price is right' however I'm not 100% sure.<p>I've seen a few companies (e.g. Recurly) do 'Early Adopter Pricing' where they offer a certain price to people who sign up early. That price will be grandfathered forever.<p>Has anyone here experimented with this? Is it better to just set a price then change and grandfather people?

Do what you normally do, but also add in the following: follow up <i>with the office staff</i>. Give them a free demo. Ask if any of them want to try the software. But don't let them do it live. Take their photo (or whatever you need) and ask them what they'd want done. Then do it at home (even though you could do it live, don't). Follow up in a few days by emailing the before and after images to that office member and CC the doc.<p>Again, not sure if this would be effective, but office staff, in my experience, would love to talk about this type of stuff.",1276358172

1426146,comment,1425910,1425910,0,0,Ratufa,,,"There are a few components involved in this disaster:<p>1) The ""system"" which, in the article, refers to the standard procedures and best practices one should follow when monitoring and running an oil well of this type.  From what the author said, it appears that if the people at the well had followed these procedures the blowout wouldn't have happened.<p>2) Human error -- people being careless, rushed, drunk, tired, not understanding procedures, etc.  This is the ""people aren't immune to screw-ups"" factor.  It's not clear how much this applies to this particular incident.<p>3) There's another sort of ""system"" that 1) and 2) are embedded in, and that is the system of incentives in which people operate.  This includes things like your manager pressuring you to ""do it anyway"", or knowing that your promotion depends on cutting corners and being under budget. I suspect that this is the root of the problem, in this case.<p>One reason these incentives are the way they are is because they often work --- the company saves money (or the individual gets his promotion) and even when things go wrong the cost of the failure may be less than the money saved (though, that likely won't be true in the case of BP). Other reasons may involve not fully understanding the risks, or principal/agent issues.",1276357746

Facebook is by far the largest social network and seems to have the most users. Also, Facebook is a bit more complicated application than (for instance) Twitter.<p>I hate to compare Twitter and Facebook, since they're not really competing for the same market, but none the less, this is how I see it from a technical standpoint: Twitter has less users, simpler structure, a lot of downtime.

It would be perfect for the 3D techniques developed for Avatar.  The techniques in Pixar's palette would be awesome if turned to this purpose, especially if they used a different art director for each planet/culture.<p>Lord of the Rings was covered by Bass and Rankin and Ralph Bakshi animations before WETA's LotR movies.  It was LotR that finally did full justice to those properties.  (Though I really like Bakshi's movie.

If following the rules wouldn't result in the desired outcome, that's clearly a system failure.  If the rules are not fault-tolerant, such as when a mistake causes substantial harm, that's a failure of the system; no redundancy.<p>When the people operating the entire system simply disregard the rules in a massive scale, that's a human failure.  No rules-based solution can work, or be blamed, if the people are ignoring it, and ""flying by the seat of their pants.""

1426130,comment,1421381,1422601,0,0,limberg,,,"I fought this challenge a few years ago and made some some (albeit, little) progress. Besides not being fully versed in programming, I ran into many other problems from processing time, threading, concurrency, but as a number of you mentioned, the biggest challenge is cost. The throughput with or without intent to purchase wouldn't come close to covering the cost of queries. There are ways to offset this- using on/off site marketing, limiting query combinations, and partnerships, but the problem is big- and grows bigger with each subtle change in the query. Cacheing results can help, but the real value of the tool diminishes with each cached result.<p>I went back and forth with Bill O (at Kayak) while leveraging their API, and know the cost/query was fairly high a few years ago. I suspect it has decreased, but probably not to the point where the processing power needed for massive permutations and cost/query makes this any more feasible.<p>I set up a proof of concept in 2006/2007 that still works (most of the time). I ended up using Flash/Flex front-end to overcome the number of browser HTTP connections (and keep some of the processing on the client). I'm not sure this actually helped the server or not b/c I never did any testing. I also limited to ""where can you go"" (multiple city pairs) and ""when should I go"" (single city pair with multiple dates), but not a combination of both.<p>Feel free to take a look. It will shut down after the max number of queries/day is reached.<p><a href=""http://takoph.com/poc/takoph.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://takoph.com/poc/takoph.html</a>",1276357176

223786,comment,223380,223380,0,0,gexla,,,"Thanks guys, apparently this community isn't for me.  The point system is just that, silly points.  But I get a few bumps up from long thoughtful posts and a huge bump down for one bad one.  The down votes are way out of proportion with the up votes.<p>The point system can discourage participation.  I am a pro hacker like many here and also like many here I have very little time to contribute to boards like these.  When I get so heavily down voted for something I felt was not that proportionally out of place or spammy then I wonder why I should bother to spend time here.  I'm blacklisting this site from my browser.<p>Edit: One more thing to add.  Voting is an anonymous comment, which is evil.  Even worse, it is an anonymous comment with no text.  People have nothing to risk in a vote.  They are not putting their opinions and views out there for discussion.  This is another reason I feel the vote system is flawed.",1214074418

223778,comment,223552,223690,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"IMHO, the internet enabled us to <i>discover</i> the existence of the Long Tail and appreciate that it's there and is of huge potential, but is ill-suited (at least in its current format) for making use of the Long Tail. I had high hopes for ""the semantic web"" and unlocking the tail; but that - most unfortunately - amounted to nothing.",1214072966

While it's straight forward to send a single message to an individual from your web site, managing group communications are more complex. Padpaw is offering this capability which has been developed and tested with real live groups.<p>The text messaging service consists of a REST API to Padpaw's messaging server which allows for a quick integration. Individuals and companies wishing to use the API will need to register with Padpaw to obtain an API key. You can find out more information, including documentation at our web site:<p><<a href=""http://padpaw.net/api/&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://padpaw.net/api/&#62</a>;<p>Future API releases will incorporate other Padpaw features such as event RSVP, sign-ups, and polls.<p>The service is in Beta and we're looking forward to you trying it and giving us your feedback. During our limited Beta program, you can use the messaging system to up to 200 messages. Pricing for our production version of the service will be announced later.",1214072335

223770,comment,223744,223744,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"I was really surprised to see how little research is done in the CS fields until I realized something: the lines only show the quantity of citations going in and out <i>across different fields</i>.<p>They have bio and med listed separately when they're really closely tied - so they naturally have a huge amount of information exchange going on between the two, making for the seemingly-gargantuan research count/amonut for those areas.<p>In CS, on the other hand, the amount of research <i>is</i> huge (probably biggest of all since the barrier of entry is so low and isn't limited to people of that field alone); but it's mainly CS people citing other CS people's work(s). We effectively live in a bubble, albeit a very huge one. We interact and share with one another, but not that much with the rest of the industries - and we probably should, since there's a lot of ideas in cyberspace that can be mapped directly to real life.....",1214071776

I started working as an undergrad RA my sophomore year by approaching one of my professors in the spring quarter of my freshman year and asking if there was anything I could do to help out. I basically helped a more senior undergrad with his honors thesis -- I helped run subjects, review papers, collect data in the field, etc. The next year I became co-Lab Manager (I graduated after that year). Many other undergrads did similar work in that lab, and in fact, most of us went on to good grad programs, probably partially on the strength of strong recommendations.<p>During my second year, I also approached another professor in the dept who was a MacArthur Fellow and asked the same thing, and ended up helping him transcribe and code a bunch of interviews he had done. Wasn't the sexiest work I've ever done, but voila, at the end of three years, I had one very strong letter of rec from one professor (well published), who also reached out through his network to put in a good word for me at CMU, and another rec from a professor who was a MacArthur Fellow.<p>Granted, I think something that's really cool about my undergrad (UCSD) and department (Cognitive Science) is that they are very open to undergrads helping out in research capacities, but it doesn't seem like something that is out of the reach of most self starting undergrads.",1319763199

The fact is that only you can work towards repairing your credit or credit score. Before we look into steps on how to repair your credit let us take a look at the things, which can lead to a bad credit. One of the main reasons of getting into debt and spoiling your credit is the inability to pay back your loans and bills on time because you lack of money.

Instead of fighting an a battle which is exponentially increasing in difficulty, you chose to optimize the reliability of a single component.

This article takes on the more extreme case for almost complete deregulation, but there are many viable alternatives.  While I support some licensing, I do think that law is an almost textbook case of regulatory capture.  In particular, the requirement of three years of grad school in a specific type of school is almost certainly unnecessary.<p>This article seems to claim the elite tier of law would not be affected.  I'm not so sure.  Imagine if people with top degrees in other fields were allowed to take the bar, or allowed an accelerated degree program.  Many people really can learn more in 6 months than others can learn in 3 years.",1319761575

It sounds good to someone whose taken Econ 101 and little else: ""ABA occupational licensing requirements have allowed lawyers to create a club with a limited membership that is able to raise prices to consumers, which is how top lawyers can get away with charging upwards of $1000 per hour for their time.""<p>But the reality of the situation is that there is almost no barrier to entry for lawyers as it is. The bar passage rate for graduates of ABA law schools in NYC is almost 90%. There is indeed a huge glut of lawyers---between 1/3 and 1/2 of graduates of ABA schools do not get jobs as lawyers.<p>So what about those $1,000/hour lawyers? Why isn't the vast oversupply of lawyers bringing down prices? For exactly the reasons the article mentions: because when you're doing a $1 billion deal or you have bet-the-company litigation you don't want just any lawyer. You want your lawyers to be smarter than the other guy's lawyers. There is a huge rush to lawyers with the top credentials.<p>There are already small firms paying their lawyers $40k/year and offering low rates that would be happy to take peoples' business. Even these firms have more applicants looking for a job than they can handle. Yet the business isn't forthcoming.<p>If you want to see than $1,000/hour go down figure out a way to get Harvard and Columbia to graduate more JD's each year, or figure out a way to get people to buy cut-rate services from budget law firms.<p>Also, even ignoring the economic fantasy in the Brookings argument, there is a practical issue. Subversion of the law is potentially extremely profitable but in highly market-distorting ways. Big firm lawyers will help clients push the boundaries of the law, but the potential for disbarment (basically the death penalty to a lawyer's career) is a strong incentive to force them to toe the line.

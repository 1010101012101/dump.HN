(I'm the founder of Silktide and author of that rant).<p>We had some constructive suggestions on what could be done instead, although these are definitely up for debate. The gist would be using a rel element like so:<p><a href='privacy.html' rel='privacypolicy'>Privacy</a><p>and then using that as a means of consistently linking to a privacy policy. As a result, policies would have consistent language for users ('look for the ""Privacy"" link') but could also be detected automatically by browsers or testing tools.<p>That way you could actually test your site is properly linking to a policy, and users could have browser preferences like ""disable cookies until I've seen a policy"" or whatever.<p>It's just an idea but we've implemented it on our sites and will be interested to see what others think:<p><a href=""http://blog.silktide.com/2012/09/fixing-a-broken-cookie-law/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.silktide.com/2012/09/fixing-a-broken-cookie-law/</a>",1346846081

4478917,comment,4476936,4478701,2,0,SeanLuke,,,"There's a bit of goofiness about crossover in this thread.<p>So far as I know, since its inception in the 1970s, crossover has <i>never</i> been thought of as a mechanism for ""avoiding local minima"".  Indeed, the early trend of crossover without mutation was what resulted in studies in so-called ""premature convergence,"" where the population would converge to a single genome and be permanently locked in a local optimum.<p>Rather, crossover is a procedure for spreading good subsolutions (so-called ""building blocks"") rapidly through the population.  This is effectively projecting the search space into many smaller spaces, so has the potential of searching much faster if -- and this is a big if -- the problem in question has very low dependance among its parameters. In the GA world, this is known as parameter ""linkage"" or ""epistasis"".  Other techniques do something similar: for example, EDAs or coevolution or ant colony optimization all perform a related projection and likewise make a related assumption of low dependance.<p>> Very often, the most efficient evolutionary search algorithm involves a population of one (or two, depending how you count them): generate a mutation, compare it to the current best.<p>Not really true.  There are lots of EAs which are touted as ""the most efficient"".  A few, like CMA-ES, are by and large mutation-only algorithms.  But others, like cooperative coevolution or hBOA (and other EDAs), are essentially extremes in crossover-like mixing.",1346845792

A form factor very close to Samsung's last two flagship models.*<p>You mean ""a bigger screen""?<p>Well, it could have had even less distinguishing factors and it would have been just fine in my books. They created that kind of design, it's not like they have to differentiate for the sake of differentiation. Incremental cpu/memory/storage/batter upgrades are OK too.<p>><i>And that new iPad mini everybody's so excited about? Copying a form factor that Samsung pioneered and Amazon and Google validated. Maybe next Apple will copy the Note?</i><p>They actually had prototypes in various sizes years before Samsung, Amazon or Google ever thought of going into the tablet space, or even the original iPad come out.<p>Plus, Apple created the mass market for tablets. Before the iPad it was a wasteland with few inhabitants.<p>Samsung taking the iPad and offering something similar in a smaller form factor is something original, really? And Apple making a smaller version of THEIR OWN PRODUCT is copying Samsung? That's some twisted logic.<p>><i>So who exactly is copying whom here?</i><p>Samsung.<p>They copied the iPod in a smaller form factor, and now Apple will offer a small form factor themselves. Should Apple preemptively put out all possible form factors at once, to not be considered a copycat?

4478909,comment,4478769,4478769,22,0,TomGullen,,,"Math in poker is a little overrated.  It's often listed as an advantage of the game by less experienced players.<p>Once you have the basics nailed (mainly expected value calculations) there really isn't much more to it, the rest of the skill then comes from estimating opponents hand ranges.  And past that, meta game, hand range balancing, deception etc become increasingly important.<p>Poker is an amazing game when you're playing people who also understand the game.  When you're scrapping at the free games it's a pretty dismally inefficient learning tool.  If you want to play good people, you need to play with money.<p>If you get to a reasonable level at poker, it does have a lot of advantages.  Here's a blog post I wrote comparing running a startup to playing poker:
<a href=""http://www.scirra.com/blog/80/why-running-a-startup-is-like-playing-poker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scirra.com/blog/80/why-running-a-startup-is-like-...</a><p>Poker also has a big potential downside, which is obsession, outright misery and despair which can slowly creep into your life.  Distinguishing between addiction and a pursuit you are thoroughly interested in and enjoy is often difficult to pinpoint.<p>Poker also has other downsides which I've observed many times, even with close friends.  Illusions of grandeur are common, and can be destructive in your life in a larger way than you are prepared to admit.  For example, many players who have been playing for many years still believe they can go pro.  These players don't study the game, they just play it and often bemoan their bad luck.  For years.  In an alternative Universe they might have perused a career, yet they are still playing small stakes games and bleeding off their money at a very slow pace, slow enough to kid themselves that they are simply suffering a bad run of luck.<p>Perseverance and self belief really aren't virtuous qualities in poker for most people.<p>Harrington on Holdem are the best strategy books on poker in my opinion.  If anyone is interested in seeing how poker players should be thinking as they play I highly recommend those books!<p>As for recommending people go into poker, I actively tell people to steer well clear of it.  Money flows upwards, addicts keep on self destructing and the winning players will justify it with ethically dubious statements like ""if I don't take their money, someone else will"", or with blinders on with statements such as ""all the losing players are probably just casual and playing for fun"" to appease their own ethics.<p>A lot of winning players do not understand or empathise the torture that some losing players have to endure.<p>There is a real pleasure playing poker on a table with people who are equal, or above you in skill level.  The level of thought, the challenge, the tactics are thoroughly thoroughly enjoyable.  I was never especially good at poker, but I did touch upon these sorts of experiences.  To get there though will take most people a lot of time, probably time better spent elsewhere.",1346845630

I mean, we might have had a ""way to summarise the CSS standard compliance"", as in ""this browser is CSS 2 compatible"", but we never had a 100% compatible browser for any previous version. I doubt we still have a full CSS2 compatible browser engine, so so much for summarizing.<p>Now, it could be easier: we could have a browser that is 100% compatible with A, B, C, D CSS modules and lacks in X, Y, Z.<p>It's not like developers care about the overall compatibility. What they do care is ""can I use this or that feature?"". To say ""this engine is 90% CSS3 compatible doesn't answer that"". Only 100% compatibility would answer those kinds of questions (""yes, you can use ANY feature"").<p>So, they way to summarise compliance will be, as it is the practice anyway, with some list of CSS features and Yes/No tick marks. And for some things, with the knowledge that for  that module the engine has 100% compliance (easier to achieve than the ellusive 100% compliance over ALL modules).",1346844195

Windows is mosly a point and click deal. Even the .NET IDE of choice (VS) is less about coding and more about hitting the space bar. I'm not critizing it, because it is very good and helps save time. Though it did make me lazier, which I thought would be impossible. On the other hand, Linux/python/any language really, is a bit more raw. You have to do a lot of things yourself. There is little hand holding (though it has been improved over the last years). It pushed me to really dig into the OS and learn how it works, instead of just sitting there clicking. It has also helped as an engineer, because I know write code that is more modular, instead of platform specific. And by modular I dont mean OOP abstractions, but it the end product being able to be used by different OS versions.<p>I suggest you just jump right into it. Being well versed in Linux doesn't mean you will not hit walls. You will. I guarantee it. It just means you will understand why did you hit the wall and how to jump over it. I suggest you create a VM with Ubuntu running on it and just install stuff without a fear of breaking it. One of the most fun (and frustrating) experiences I had was with learning how to use chmod. I once changed almost every file on the OS to file settings 777 (writeable, readable by anyone).<p>Just keep hacking at it. It has taken me at least 6 years to reach this point.",1346843796

I lose respect for anyone who just dismisses it out of hand because they think that's the cool choice.<p>But I agree that the plot and characters are shallow.  The book was designed to showcase her philosophy and it does it well.  I don't believe it was ever intended to be realistic, and I think it fell a little short of being entertaining a lot of the time.  It was far too long.  It was still far better than a lot of other fiction books I've read.<p>What I get out of the book (which I've read 3 times) is a different look on self-worth and self-sacrifice than all the rest of society gives.  I believe people would be better off if everyone acted in a rational manner to promote their own interests.  (It's not actually rational to hurt others to promote yourself.  In the long run, that's a losing strategy.)  I also believe that this will never actually happen, and so compromises are in order.<p>I believe that book has helped me form a better sense of my own worth, and was at least partially responsible for me leaving a job and getting a 40% raise at the next one.  It's not the only factor, but it helped to be able to objectively assess my value to the company, as well as how much I value my own time.<p>Does that mean I'm a card-carrying Objectivist who doesn't give to charity?  No.  It means I'm a more rational person who evaluates things a little more clearly.  In fact, I actually give to charity <i>more</i> now than before, so the book can hardly be said to have hurt that.  I do give for slightly different reasons now, though.  Before, I gave because it was the thing to do.  Now, I give because I want that charity to work.  If I give to the Red Cross, it's because I want them to help sick or hurt people.  If I give to Child's Play, it's because I want sick children to find a little bit of joy in their lives.  Those things may seem obvious, but they weren't.<p>A good example is United Way.  I don't give to them.  Why?  Because all they do is slice off a large percent (13% apparently) and give the rest to an actual charity.  Before, I had never really considered this, and just bought into their propaganda.<p>""Of each dollar United Way collects, over 87 cents goes directly to valuable community services. "" - <a href=""http://www.forsythunitedway.org/faq.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forsythunitedway.org/faq.cfm</a><p>They used to be very vocal about how much went to a real charity, pushing that statistic in front of you like it was a good thing.  That is <i>not</i> good.  That 13% could be going to a real charity, too, and actually helping people.<p>So in the end, don't lose respect for people merely because they like something.

Me: Yes
L: Can you give me Paulius' (my employee) phone number?
Me: What is this about?
L: Well, he helped me with my university assignment some time ago and blah blah...
Me: OK, I'll pass him the phone right now<p>Turned out this was a recruiter and she tried to offer my employee a job and, apparently, I was their connector. O_o<p>Seriously, WTF!?",1346843114

Interestingly, I got most traffic through Twitter which I hardly ever use personally.<p>Anyway, that was an EC2 Micro running PHP-FPM on Nginx, and it stayed up without problems through millions of hits over a few days as well. It's easy to write a well-scaling single-function site like that.<p>Yet a lot of blogs and more complex sites die instantly when they cross a couple of dozen hits per second. I suspect there are multiple reasons for it, but the most egregious one coming to mind is the typical PHP setup within shared hosting environments where every single request means about 30 file compilations and a lot of DB requests. Caching is probably not very popular either.",1346842848

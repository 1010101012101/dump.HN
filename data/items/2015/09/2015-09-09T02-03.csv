So I&#x27;ll give my best shot for making a generic recommendation.<p>The first thing to understand is that books on meditation are not going to help you all that much. This is not something you try to understand intellectually. It is experiential. You are much better off attempting to practice. If you need help with practice, there are various groups and flavors of mindfulness meditation: vipassana, zen, insight, etc. There&#x27;s going to be a flavor, and a group of people with whom it will feel right.<p>Barring that, hacker_9&#x27;s suggestion of the Meditation sub-reddit is not bad. My suggestion though is to ignore the people talking about theory -- practice, find people who practice, and allow the issues and observations to surface up from there. It&#x27;s a kind of empirical inquiry into yourself where you drive the discussion through your observations, rather than the other way around.<p>Now having said that, the most generic book on helping you practice meditation that I recommend is Mindfulness in Plain English. You can find this for free online.<p>I have also heard about Calm and Headspace apps and knew people who tried it. They are probably not a bad way to start -- though like all things, it comes and goes, and there will come a time to drop it and move on.<p>Traditional Buddhist teachings don&#x27;t necessarily get into the psychological aspects of it. Or let me be more precise: the psychological descriptions don&#x27;t seem to resonate well with Westerners, and is typically dismissed as part of empty ceremonies, or pre-modern descriptions of psychology. (For example: what does the Padme Family or the element of Air have anything to do with your  day-to-day life?)<p>So a meditation practice can be paired with therapy, and will work very well if the therapist also practices.<p>That leads to the other book I would recommend, since people are interested in healing their neurotic patterns. There is a great book whose technique complements mindfulness meditation: Tsultrim Allione&#x27;s &quot;Feeding Your Demons: Ancient Wisdom for Resolving Inner Conflict&quot;. This book distilled out an older practice in a way that combines with gestalt therapy and presented in a way that is much more accessible for people who grew up in the West. Like the tradition it comes from, although the full method uses visualization methods, it ends with mindfulness meditation. Along with a regular practice of meditation, it&#x27;s a great way to deliberately gain some insight into your subconscious.<p>Hope that helps.",1441767577

The problem of course is that without it working as well as it currently does, premium content providers have no incentive (and in fact, are decentivized) from making the switch.<p>The general idea of decrypting premium content at a cost would work fairly well, however I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s something that can be done easily and dynamically via IPFS. For example, can I, without burdening the network with a billion copies, encrypted with each the client&#x27;s key, hand that data off to them?

10189406,comment,10189065,10189065,0,0,chroma,,,"I agree with pretty much every criticism in this article. Where I differ in opinion is the solution.<p>First, there&#x27;s the &quot;me too&quot; effect. If colleges pay football players, other athletes will want to be paid. They&#x27;ll ask, &quot;What makes football special?&quot; and they&#x27;ll have a point. Then we&#x27;ll run into some unhappy truths regarding sports. For example: If colleges base compensation on revenue, the wage gap between male and female athletes will be massive.<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem of mixing sports and education. If these athletes are paid, do they still have to attend classes? Do they have to get good grades? Are they given scholarships in addition to monetary compensation? Can athletes switch colleges if another school will pay them more?<p>It seems to me that most of these problems would be solved by creating a minor league separate from college. If people are so attached to college names, then the colleges can sell naming rights.<p>But honestly, I&#x27;m hard-pressed to find a sport more repugnant than football. If football came into being today, people would riot in the streets. Who would pay money to watch mostly lower-class, mostly black[1] players permanently damage each other&#x27;s brains and bodies? Who would cheer during such an event? Yes, it can be argued that athletes know the risks, but the same is true for dueling. In the past, people thought dueling was fine. Today, we recognize it to be a barbarous tradition. I believe that, as we do with dueling, future societies will condemn us for allowing this sport to continue.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_players_in_American_professional_football#Today"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_players_in_American_prof...</a>",1441766954

You&#x27;ll hear everything from changes in diet, too much TV, too much social media, too much time in front of the iPad, etc.<p>As an anecdote to perhaps corroborate yours, it felt impossible for me to get up at 7am every morning M-F from the ages of 9-22. It also felt highly unnatural to be doing so at all, as a majority of my friends experienced the same thing -- a very shifted sleep schedule which started later in the evening and lasted 8+ hours into almost noontime. Of course this could all be due to too much TV, too much social media, too much iPad, etc.<p>As for the article, play seems central to development. It certainly plays a role in bonding formation[1] and neural development[2]. However, just like every other factor, it&#x27;s just hard to suss out its relative weight compared to everything else a child experiences during development.<p>My personal view is that this is all very speculative. When we can model the brain better, whether it&#x27;s through more carefully controlled studies or even through machine intelligence simulations, we will actually be able to determine its real value.

He showed me a modified C128 with an IDE interface, running his custom modded version of GEOS (Wheels). He had an accelerator hooked up to the machine and could change the CPU speed from the original C64/128 speed to something that appeared to be 10 times faster. To top off the demo, he showed me the web browser he was working on, bringing up a roughly rendered version of Yahoo&#x27;s page (it was 1999) on the screen.<p>It turned out my mechanic was the famous (or infamous) Maurice Randall.

Chance is pretty big that you do not need app containers because your use case is too small for justifying this &quot;modern&quot; layer of abstraction which will give you also new sort of &quot;modern&quot; problems for sure at some stage.

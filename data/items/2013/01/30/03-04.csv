The APU also provides emergency backup power and cabin pressurization in-flight if the engines fail.<p>The 787 is unusual in that it's a ""bleedless"" aircraft; it uses other systems -- some of them electrically-powered -- to supply compressed air for various purposes, rather than ""bleeding"" compressed air from the engines. The batteries are part of that, and have to be onboard because the plane needs compressed air while in flight.",1359518398

I think that one of the more important caveats to mention is that to the extent that your application is composed of rich interactions, visualizations and interactivity, and logged-in-user-only content, that stuff tends to remain on the client-side alone ... but for your basic rendering of JavaScript models to a flat HTML page, this is a great project to keep a close watch on.

You've ""tried meeting technical founders and hackathons, but its harder than we think."" That's just weak.<p>You have to realize that you're within a forum of people that are very passionate and good at what they do. I really don't think anybody in the HN community is looking for a non-technical co-founder who is essentially saying they can't convince hackers, in person, at hackathons to bet on you.<p>If your rational was that you believe in HN users more than just a guy you can meet at a hackathon (not a bad approach, by the way), then you'd have merit. But your explanation basically suggests that you've been shot down hackathons, so now you're here to pick up a co-founder.<p>I'm not suggesting that finding a co-founder on HN is unheard of, nor that it is a bad idea (I particularly liked Coinbase's attempt merely days before the HN application deadline). But this whole presentation sounds unimpressive.<p>Lastly, having played point in both the non-technical and a technical founder roles, I'd suggest that you drop ""I've tried but its harder than you think"" line from your lexicon. Paul Graham has a succinct essay on this, but being a good founder is about being relentlessly resourceful. While you may have tried, and it my be harder than anyone thinks it is, both points are irrelevant. You jut have to do it. And you can't, or don't, you'll just be forgotten about.<p>I wish you the best of luck.",1359518206

It seems like you really think it has a lot of promise.<p>That being said, I don't think CRA is a panacea. Databases will always have a ""read, decide what to do, write"" pattern (because that is what happens in the real world, and databases model the real world). If the read happens at time T, and the write happens at time T+100; then you could have a race condition if something happens at time T+50.<p>Postgres can detect such race conditions by using true serializability (based on a technique called Serializable Snapshot Isolation[1]). It gets tricky to apply the same technique for temporal databases, though I believe it's possible. Do you happen to know what techniques Datomic offers users to help avoid/detect/resolve race conditions?<p>Don't get me wrong. I think it's a very useful direction to go in. I've done a lot of work on temporal features in postgres. I'm also aware of some of the limitations, however. You still need some kind of coordination and something resembling locks or a conflict detector.<p>(By the way, please avoid derogatory comments about people who make different technology choices than you do. An argument could be made that postgres is CRA. And even if not, CRA versus CRUD is a small part of what is actually important to users; many of whom face a different set of trade-offs than you do.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://drkp.net/papers/ssi-vldb12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drkp.net/papers/ssi-vldb12.pdf</a>",1359517882

In other words, you're saying those factors can be boiled down to something that is an inherent quality that we possess in ourselves, which is we maximise reproductive success.<p>Does this make sense? I dislike SCT too now but I wasn't trying to imply the perfect image society creates is socially constructed when I said ""personifying what society has deemed as the perfect image."" I meant regardless of whether society is socially constructed or not, this system that I'm referring to as ""society"" creates an ideal image of what a human being should look like. If society is not socially constructed, and is in fact defined by our biology, then that would mean this ideal image also originates from our biology. Regardless of all this, there is a perfect image we strive for.<p>I feel like we're on the same page, and I totally relate to your view that, and I'm going to paraphrase you: ""it is in our nature to be highly responsive to our nurture."" Our nurture is not an individual entity from the system, our nurture is grounded by our biology.",1359517127

All publicity is good publicity.\n  2. All branding is identical, verbatim, (e.g. no \n     use of small, medium, large; instead branded sizing \n     parlance is used) forcing the customer to closely \n     inspect the imitation for flaws. This forces a level of \n     psychological engagement in the customer that would not \n     occur in regular, legitimate establishments.\n  3. Starbucks, for all it&#x27;s popularity, rarely experiences\n     negative press. Thus, their brand can easily tolerate \n     examples of light trolling.\n  4. Dubious &quot;news&quot; coverage offers vectors for market \n     penetration into sectors that represent the Lowest\n     Common Denominator, without cheapening Starbucks&#x27; \n     brand. In other words, they can speak to an audience\n     that they&#x27;d rather not be associated with, without \n     having to directly engage them. They can inject their \n     brand&#x27;s presence into the daily lives of people who \n     would not ordinarily pay attention to their usual modes \n     of advertising.\n  5. Without an entity to claim credit for this activity, \n     this parody only serves to provide increased exposure \n     to Starbucks. A well executed parody without an author\n     will provide no alternate context to the premise of the\n     joke. If there is any meaning or theme to the parody, \n     the audience can barely guess at what it should be, if\n     the intent of the performer cannot be discerned.\n\n  6. Hypothesis: The &quot;Dumb&quot; shop will only stay open for as \n     long as the minor local news publicity lasts. It&#x27;s \n     there only to make people use the word &quot;Starbucks&quot; as \n     frequently as possible, in as many sound bites as       \n     possible, trigger some water cooler conversation for \n     about a week (word of mouth buzz), and then die.</code></pre>",1391993996

I took a look at the various 2D physics ports that had been made to JavaScript, and they all had pretty bad performance. Also, I knew from my work as a filmmaker that &quot;real physics&quot; is actually a pain in the ass, because what you actually want is directable physics that <i>feel</i> real. (Stick with me, I&#x27;m getting there...)<p>So, I took a step back and determined that what I wanted was to be able to use tween curves like normal, but have the actual path that was taken depend on the velocity and/or acceleration of the movement when the user released their finger, yet be &quot;directed&quot; according to the tween curve.<p>That required doing math, specifically, getting first and second derivatives from your tween curves. Yuck. Except, CS to the rescue, there are these things called Dual numbers[1], and when you use them, you get automatic differentiation[2] for free, without having to rewrite your code.<p>So I wrote a Dual number implementation for JavaScript, grabbed a JS parser and rewrote the tween functions at load time (i.e. with code, automatically) to use the Dual numbers so that I could extract the velocity and acceleration. I then took the original curve based on the user&#x27;s movement, blended it with the tween derivatives, and the resulting animations were actually really great. The whole thing was efficient enough to get real time performance on an iPad 3 in mobile Safari, entirely in JavaScript.<p>And the total time from start of work to the physics-based Dual-number tween animations in Blossom? Two days, and about 2K LOC.<p>If I hadn&#x27;t know about Dual numbers, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d have gotten there just by sitting down and programming, and who knows how long it took the FB team to do the dynamics for FB Home, or the Apple team to add UI Dynamics to iOS 7. My guess is that it took longer than two days...<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/erichocean/blossom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/erichocean/blossom</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation</a>",1391993897

7208384,comment,7207348,7208316,4,0,squirejons,,,"well, this strategy was all laid out by the designer of the american constitution over 200 years ago in the federalist papers (the ones written by madison) and his notes on the constitutional convention. Madison wrote that the primary purpose of the structure of the american govt under his constitution was to preserve wealth inequality. Madison wrote that the way to do this was to prevent the majority from uniting and discovering their common interest. The way he proposed to keep the majority from uniting was to create factions in voting districts by creating enlarged voting district (federal districts). Thus enlarged, the districts would have more factions and that would &quot;protect the minority of the opulent against the majority&quot; (to quote madison).<p>Also useful in preventing the majority from using the government against the minority of the opulent was the pseudo-democratic structure of the federal govt (strong checks and balances and separation of powers). This would hinder the ability of the majority to control the government. That would keep the wealth of madsison, jefferson, washington, morris et al., safe from that dirty, brutish mob (i.e., you and me).<p>The benefit to the elite of factions created by nation enlargement? The elite get to keep more of their wealth.<p>As the USA grows larger and more heterogeneous with mass immigration, we are less and less in control of our own govt.<p>Our cultural cousins in the rest of the western nations (canada, australia, UK, scandanavia, france, austria, germany etc) are all smaller and more homogeneous, and so the majority there therefore have more control of their own nations. However, as they elite cram more immigrants into those nations, factions grow and there is less majority control. And of course the elite created the EU along the lines of the USA so as to remove as much power as possible from the majority in those member nations.",1391993696

The jump in abstraction level doesn&#x27;t seem that high but the complexity seems much lower and code reuse is actually possible, so it would be worth it too. Maybe even for those programmers that never embraced those abstract factories because they simply didn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;d get enough benefit.<p>There is just not enough (approachable) material on the subject right now but the amount seems to be growing every day. The percieved &quot;coolness&quot; factor is also rising, and even though in principle we should choose only based on technical merits, us programmers will definitely go through many more obstacles for something that is perceived as cool / fashionable / in demand.<p>My guess is that most programmers are simply put off by the completely alien terminology rather than the complexity or abstraction level.

We must understand the why behind it.  That is the final cause, or the purpose for the thing.<p>What you cannot answer is this: How can final cause -- purpose or motivating reason for something -- arise out of nothing?

The Supreme Court ruling Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music says that any such analysis must include four factors: if it&#x27;s commercial/non-commercial, the nature of the copied work, the amount copied, and the effect of the copy on the market for the original work.<p>Parody requires that the original music be somehow recognizable, so the courts disagree with your &quot;do I recognize the sample&quot; test.<p>The &quot;catchy tune&quot; example you gave may be a violation of copyright, or it may be fair use. For example, if the original song was from the 1970s, with a current market of 20 iTunes+Amazon+whatever sales per year, and the new song comes out making 1 million sales, then it&#x27;s fair to say that the new song did not greatly affect the primary market. A full analysis would need to cover at least those three other factors as well.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about the Kanye West / Daft Punk / Edwin Birdsong example. I follow so little of modern music. I&#x27;ve certainly read more copyright cases than I&#x27;ve heard songs from all three of those composers combined.<p>More classically, consider Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s famous and lovely scat version of the song &quot;How High the Moon&quot;, in which she quotes from other popular songs, including &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot;, &quot;Heat Wave&quot;, &quot;A-Tisket, A-Tasket&quot;, and &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot;. These are music samples, which include the catchy hook from those songs, but where I think anyone would agree there was no market confusion.<p>I do not know how copyright issues were settled for that recording, nor in live performances (in jazz improvisation, the artist make things up on the spot; how then would all the original artists get paid?). However, it was before Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc. , which is the court case that established that samples were under copyright law. During Fitzgerald&#x27;s time her use was likely &quot;accepted practice and such copyright considerations as these were viewed as largely irrelevant.&quot; (Quoting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use</a> )<p>We had a very vibrant music industry before Grand Upright Music v. Warner Bros, and it allowed genres like scat which incorporated snippets of other copyrighted material. However, do note that that Fitzgerald wasn&#x27;t &quot;sampling.&quot; There are different copyrights for the lyrics, the music, and the musicians, and sampling covers recordings. This is why some hip hop artists use &quot;interpolation&quot; - replaying the music but with different instruments, and only paying the songwriter and not the artist or label. It may sound very similar, but it&#x27;s not the same and so not covered by the &quot;sound recording&quot; definition used in Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films.<p>I am not so versed in music copyright at software and written works, and didn&#x27;t learn about interpolation until just now. When you say &quot;sampling&quot;, do you also mean to include interpolation?<p>BTW, I see you use the term &quot;stolen.&quot; The better term is &quot;infringed.&quot; Copyright is a limited monopoly protection which expires, and so far copyright violations are part of civil law rather than criminal. While &quot;stolen&quot; has connotations of property rights and criminal law. Using the concept &quot;stolen&quot; may lead to incorrect assumptions when some concepts are incorrectly transferred.",1391993149

Capitalism can&#x27;t be fixed with a few patches here and there, it must be abolished and trying to appear moderate makes you no different than the crew members of Pequod who played into Ahab&#x27;s mania.<p>The assumption here is that moderation is what has prevented the course of Pequod (and decaying civilizations) from correcting their course. You question what happens when we throw Ahab overboard while ignoring the fact that each passing minute and hour you let Ahab run free, your security and well-being are threatened. Why fuss over what happens when you toss Ahab over when Ahab poses a nearly immediate threat to your well-being? That&#x27;s just more of the moderation that silently rationalizes Ahab&#x27;s actions.<p>Hedges brought up a number of revolutionary thinkers from all walks of the revolutionary left, yet proposed we follow no single system. The subtext being that we need to move away from capitalism, and generally need to move to the left.

If I owned 50% (ie, if this was a joint venture between me and my friend Joe), then...I&#x27;d have a claim to 50% of all future profits.  By extension, X% of ownership gives a claim to X% of the future profits.  Your share of Amazon may be tiny, but if someone wanted to buy Amazon outright, they&#x27;d need to buy your share; the value of that share to the potential buyer is proportional to the value of Amazon as a whole.<p>Approach B:  Every dollar of profit that Amazon makes is either paid out in dividends, or is retained and re-invested in order to garner future profits.  The same is true for future profits.  However, all things are finite, so at some point the company will be wound up and liquidated; any profits that have not been disbursed to shareholders via dividends will be disbursed at this time.  Ergo, every dollar of profit is eventually disbursed to shareholders.<p>(Ah, you say, but it might be a decade or more before Amazon pays dividends or is wound up.  But when you go to sell your shares, the same analysis holds, recursively.  Your share of Amazon has value because you can sell it to someone who will buy it because they can sell it to someone who will buy it because [...] they want a share of Amazon&#x27;s future dividends.)<p>Or to put it another way:  A company has assets and liabilities; if you net these out (ie, sell off all the assets and pay off all the liabilities) you get a &quot;book value&quot;.

In other words, it would cost you 17 times more to buy Amazon than it would to just build an exact replica of all their warehouses and infrastructure (and patents, and brand awareness, and goodwill, etc.).

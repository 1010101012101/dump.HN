I’m already going broke on a million a year!<p>The appalling figures came popping up into his brain. Last year his income had been $980,000. But he had to pay out $21,000 a month for the $1.8 million loan he had to take out to buy the apartment...<p>Of the $560,000 remaining of his income last year, $44,400 was required for the apartment’s monthly maintenance fee… $18,000 for heat, utilities, insurance and repairs, $6,000 for lawn and hedge cutting, $8,000 for taxes. Entertaining at home and in restaurants had come to $37,000. This was a modest sum compared to what other people spent.""",1256817302

The current state of higher education (with major emphasis on mugging, apart from minute number of good colleges) is killing many more geniuses.<p>I find a 1st year Computer Science student very keen in maths and physics, to the extent that he goes on to prove things that go above our heads. I asked him, ""So why didn't you go for a Bsc in Physics/maths?"" , his answer - ""I need to get a job first, and anyhow I can't go against wills of my father"".<p>Now look at that, neither does government not parents do enough to sustain such geniuses in our nation.
Another quote from the article - ""He received a scholarship to study at Government College in Kumbakonam, but lost it when he failed his non-mathematical coursework.""
Even this is pretty much observable here, the lack of quality higher education institution does force us to leave our passion and do the way the system dictates us to.<p>There are many geniuses, but if things continue like this, they would never be filtered out and brought to limelight, to places where their genius can be of worth.
... nothing more to say.<p>""It is the product of ignorant western minds."" --> That's such a poor generalization. (We+our gov) have been ignorant at many other important things (higher education, infrastructure, ...) than an 'Image' projected on world.",1256814974

OG and templates have saved us a ton of production time and wireframes that we creted were very clean and most importantly, they were clear and anyone who looked at them would know how stuff worked and how things were connected. OG allows you to add the right amount of detail without wasting a ton of time on minutia that creeps up if you use PS.",1177623896

Like I said in my first post post, Jobs shouldn't be above the law just because he is valuable to Apple.<p>But try to punish the cheaters, not those who are being cheated.  Don't fine the company - fine and/or jail those committing the fraud.",1177623011

17202,comment,16937,17177,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Well, if it's a choice between that and not punishing cheating period, it might be better to do that. It's a difficult situation, but in general, I'd rather have a system that always punished cheating than one that didn't punish cheating when doing so would have collateral damage, because the latter system means basically that so long as you are important to the company, you're perfectly allowed to cheat.

One of them really takes off, while the other three are just barely profitable, and you hire someone to help you with the project that's taking off.  After six months you decide to let him go.  He slaps you with a discrimination lawsuit.  Doesn't matter if it's true or not.<p>If you have incorporated your companies separately, the only company that lawsuit can take down is the one that employed him, because the assets of the other companies can not be used to pay off the liabilities of that company.  If you incorporated them all together, that lawsuit can take all of them down.  And if you haven't incorporated any of your companies, <i>your</i> assets can be used to pay off that lawsuit.  <p>And the reason it doesn't matter if it's true or not is that, even if you were completely above-board and non-discriminatory, it takes lawyer time to establish that in court, and lawyer time is not cheap.",1177621518

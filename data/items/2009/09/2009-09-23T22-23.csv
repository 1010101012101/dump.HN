I don't need health insurance if I'm happy to be covered under the public system.  Nobody goes bankrupt from healthcare costs in my country.
 2. Because of universal coverage, purchasing private healthcare for my family costs about $200/month, and it's a personal policy, not an employer based policy. 
 3.  If I employ someone I don't even have to have a discussion with them about healthcare.  It is assumed they will sort out their own health insurance, the same as they sort out their own car insurance.<p>There is no doubt that health insurance has an effect on entrepreneurship and new company formation when it is one of the highest startup costs, that needn't even exist.

840250,comment,840095,840161,0,0,jhancock,,,"It seems you are trying to argue the case that health insurance is not ""insurance"" in the way other instruments are.  I think we all get that.  There are certainly better words, but that's the word commonly used and I think most people can context switch between ""insurance"" for theft of your Van Gogh and ""insurance"" for pregnancy.<p>I had a good conversation with my closest friend, an obstetrician, a month ago.  After lots of discussion on what may happen with health care reform, he told me he thought most everyone would be best served if there were no institutions around any aspect of health care and every aspect was pay-out-of-your-pocket as it once was.  He may be right, but you can't put the genie back in the bottle.  The ""country doctor"" is a great metaphor for what was and what maybe should be, but there are numerous reason why we can't go back.<p>Like it or not, society pays for lots of things that are not evenly shared: the roads you drive on, the schools you attend, the court systems that protect people that wind up in law suits, the meat inspectors that are paid by government funds when clearly some people don't eat meat.  The list goes on.  This is not the root of the problem.  Public compromise is part of the grand beauty of living in a diverse ecosystem.<p>I agree health care is far too complex and there should be more simple and competitive options.  All I can say is if you want that, you probably need to spend more time being a part of ensuring for a larger pool of honest people that work in government.  What we will get out of this new health care bill (if it does pass) will look like your typical big piece of congressional sausage.  Your tired of congressional sausage?

840244,comment,839968,839968,0,0,anurag,,,"I tried 80legs a couple of weeks ago when it was still in beta. It works well if you're willing to write Java code to process HTTP responses (see <a href=""http://80legs.pbworks.com/80Apps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://80legs.pbworks.com/80Apps</a>). You can issue new requests in your processing code and write processed data to files which you can download once the crawl finishes. Even without Java, you can perform basic keyword/regex matching on crawled data literally by filling out a web form. And they have an API of course. Very impressive.<p>However, if you want to run crawling on your own infrastructure, I recommend Scrapy (<a href=""http://scrapy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scrapy.org/</a>), a python crawling framework introduced on HN last year. Scrapy solves some of the more time-consuming problems involved in writing a crawler from scratch (multiple simultaneous requests, pipelined processing, raw caching, duplicate URL filtering) and comes with nifty development and administration tools. More importantly, it has an active and helpful set of core developers and good documentation. I am comfortable with both Python and Java but I chose Scrapy over 80legs because I can crawl for free on the machines I already have and I can afford to spend more time crawling from a single IP compared to 80legs which will let me crawl much faster but isn't free. Also, with Scrapy my bot can be 'naughty' - 80legs jobs obey robots.txt and limit the crawling rate per domain.<p>When my crawling needs outgrow my infrastructure, I am going to look at 80legs again.",1253745010

Sending users to an non-functional site not only gives them a bad impression of your service, but massively detracts from the benefit of the news coverage in the first place.<p>Without an embargo, it's more or less impossible to coordinate coverage from multiple sources -- once a story has ""broken"", other sources don't want to cover it.<p>There's the problem of journalists breaking embargoes, and we've had that happen to us in the past with lame excuses like ""I thought it was EST instead of PST"" when it was clear otherwise -- we don't talk to those journalists anymore. If people were a bit more stringent enforcing that, it wouldn't be as much of a problem.<p>An industry-wide no embargo policy doesn't seem to be in the reader's interests (as others have pointed out) -- an embargo leaves time for the journalist to get properly acquainted with the product, ask questions, and formulate their own opinion. It also enables multiple news sources to post about the topic, from different points of view.<p>It's certainly not in the startup's best interest.

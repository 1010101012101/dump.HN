Emotion comes from believing in the product you are talking about.  Relying on an asinine word that has no real purpose in the sentence is stupid.  Think about it!  You say what the #$%^.  Really it means ""What the sexual intercourse was that!  Or that's some good defecation!<p>In my opinion the way that you talk and your method of speech tells me a lot about the person.  If someone wants to sell me on an idea and they begin swearing that person will never sell ma anything.  The individual  will not work for me!  And the company that the idiot is representing will not get my business!<p>By calling a person a writer, you have now put a label on that person that they are a professional, that they know what they are doing, what they are talking about.  A writer targets a specific audience.  By the language a writer uses, he will gain the adoration of some, and will drive others away.  I guess it all depends on who you want following you.  I personally would rather not listen to swearing.  In fact, I will walk out of a talk or presentation if the person swears to ""enhance"" his vocabulary by swearing.<p>Kinda like steroids--make you look good, makes you feel strong--but it isn't real.

What you want is a structure that rewards people linearly for the time that they contributed to the company relative to the ""duration"" of the company. To achieve this you only need two mechanism:\n1. All incentive equity goes away if the employee is terminated for cause or leaves during probation (some number of months, we use 3).\n2. For all other scenarios the employee gets to keep TE/TC shares (the rest are re-purchased if you are using reverse vesting or don't vest if you use options).<p>TC = Time of the Company from founding to liquidity event in days (or weeks as long as the unit is small relative to the expected duration of the company)<p>TE = Time in days that the employee worked at the company<p>It's actually really that simple. Obviously other factors like impact, performance, seniority, etc. play a role but those get adjusted by the magnitude of the stock grant and not the vesting process. We use a  reverse vesting shares to give employees tax advantages but the same concept could work for vesting options.<p>The advantage of this approach is that everything is nice and linear (expect the 3 months probation cliff). A lot of sneaky behaviour is just not worth it when things are linear. Remember, lack of alignment is the big killer of start-ups.",1320936415

I eat Indian vegetarian food and, ironically, I calculated my caloric intake to be 1500-1700 yesterday. I had to eat a few things once I realized it was far too low.<p>I usually force myself to block off an hour or two every day for exercise because I was raised with it and if I do not, then I feel strange, then grumpy, then downright erratic. My suggestion: Try to find something that is fun, not boring. I play soccer at an intense level, which is much more fun than running around a track or treadmill.<p>Also, (and this is arguably one of the most important things) remember how little it takes to workout really well. Your body burns calories much better when it lacks oxygen. Instead of running on the elliptical for an hour, go out to a park after work for 15 minutes and do nothing but sprints. You'll get a workout that is over 10 x better and it takes less time.",1320935938

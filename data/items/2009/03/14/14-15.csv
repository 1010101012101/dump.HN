Three paragraphs after being informed that marijuana is a <i>$14 billion dollar industry</i> already, not a $14 billion dollar industry in potential but in actual fact, we get two paragraphs of people whining about ""adding"" pot into the mix. <i>Adding</i>? It's there! Like it or not.<p>This is why journalists get no respect from me. These guys ought to be asked how anything would be ""added"" to the $14 billion industry already in place. Perhaps they'd come up with some decent answer, after all, but in the meantime their argument as presented in this article is terrible.<p>At least the last paragraph showed some sane recognition that the horse bolted from the barn millennia ago.",1237042606

To be honest, they are by far my favorites.<p>I am very happy to now be posting my own. Last month my co-founder and I launched Twollars. Twollars is a Twitter thank you currency. Simply by tweeting ""Give 5 Twollars @username"" - there is no registration - you can send Twollars to someone. (You can also use any of the other commands - here is a list on our Wiki with all the commands we are experimenting with: http://thinktank.twollars.com/wiki/71163)<p>Where we hope to do a lot of good is by allowing people to donate their Twollars to a charity. The charity in turn is sponsored by a company who pledges to donate the real amount in hard currency.<p>We are also very close to launching multi-currencies. Which will allow anyone on Twitter to start their own currency. The thoughts behind this are to allow people to setup their own community currency (similar to many open money concepts that are being tried).<p>URL: http://Twollars.com<p>Any feedback is really appreciated!<p>Thank you so much,<p>Eiso & Mac",1237042433

515868,comment,515233,515676,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Your example does flow back, which I why I drew the Excel analogy. LabVIEW is a fascinating piece of tech. I have had many occasions to loathe it -- what emacs user wouldn't hate a language that can't be edited as text? -- yet I love it all the same, and when you work in science you can't really resist using it. It is fast, and effective, and if you carefully avoid the temptation to use it for <i>everything</i> it is a joy to use.<p>Part of its secret is that it fits the problem. You're standing in a lab plugging things into other things using a snarl of BNC cables. You're not trying to design the correct abstraction. You're trying to solve your problem by lashing together the tools that you already have, sometimes in a hilarious fashion. (""We're out of voltmeters, but we do have a $50k sampling oscilloscope. We can use that!"") LabVIEW code often looks like spaghetti, but that's partly because its use case also looks like spaghetti.<p>There is more than one kind of power tool. Computer scientists like general-purpose high-level tools, for good reason. They understand that ""the pen is mightier than the sword"", and they spend a lot of time collecting pens. But sometimes you need to cut something in a hurry, and at those times there's really no substitute for a well-designed sword. You can use a pen to design a sword -- perhaps even a <i>better</i> sword -- or to convince the folks with swords to move somewhere else. But it's a long and unreliable process. And it can be immensely satisfying to just pick up a sword and stab something!",1237041442

Its leader, like other cabinet officials, is appointed by the president and confirmed by Congres, although he serves a 10-year term.

If it's a long time employee and it's because of the economy, obviously, you have to be quite a bit more sensitive. This is especially true in a small company.",1237041073

515858,comment,515605,515605,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Why did I know that the top comments would be complaints about the topic?<p>Ok -- why as a hacker (and non-pot-consumer) am I interested?<p>First, entrepreneurs are always playing the angles seeing where there might be some economic traction where there was none. Obviously if pot becomes legal, there will be social changes both in California and the rest of the U.S. I could easily imagine pot-based vacation planning as a web service. Or better still, some kind of pot fanboy sites, just like we have with wine and beer drinkers. None of these business options have been on the table until now. To me this pot stuff sounds like a lot of cash on the table. Sure the growers, distributors, and governments are going to pick most of that up, but there are lots of really interesting places to tap into that cash flow.<p>Second, as a government-hacking project, the idea fascinates me. Will the California legislature pass this? Will Arnold (a bit of a famous pot-smoker himself) sign it? If so, does the federal government step in? What's more important, having states try new unusual tactics to keep funded or having the feds control drug policy? Will the feds step in or not? It's a long way from ignoring enforcement to having states flout the federal laws. Ever since Lincoln decided that no, states aren't all that powerful there has been this interesting power struggle between states and the federal government that the feds mostly win. Will this be an exception?<p>I wouldn't want to see pot stories everyday, at least pot stories that are simply ""legalize pot, now!"" kind of things. But stories about significant other concepts, like startup opportunities or civics, that just happen to involve pot? I'm okay with that every now and then.",1237039566

It's hard for programmers to work in such an environment, and it makes the founders start to feel like employees.<p>One of my rules of thumb for dealing with startups is to use Viaweb as a test case.  And even if I'd have been willing to do it myself, there is no way I could ever have gotten Robert to dutifully show up and work in our investors' offices.",1184950555

I trust you.<p>_never confronted by a subpoena_<p>If you get a subpoena for a passphrase for a client, you will give it up. Yes you will. Now, if someone was holding terroristic bombcodes or whatever and REALLY didn't want people getting them, they ain't backing up anything online. The same people who need real security aren't going to be uploading their data anywhere .<p>",1184949808

35647,comment,35585,35585,0,0,sethjohn,,,"Especially upon re-reading the article, it looks to me as though the reporter (no doubt trying to present 'both sides of the story') began a paragraph with ""But the limits of Y Combinator's model remain unclear"" and then shoehorned in Seth Levine's comments without much regard to what he was really saying.",1184948931

However, I do applaud Seth Levine for at least addressing the issue. While the context of the comment in the USAToday article was addressed at YC, it did seem strange that Seth would blast the same model for which he contributes via TechStars. <p>I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, since to me it does seem reasonable that his comments were taken out of context.",1184948039

Think, for example, of real state; that's more of a zero sum game.  In my area, rich foreign people are buying most of the real estate for summer houses they'll visit once every other year or so, while locals have a hard time to find a first accomodation due to pumped prices.  Many people have to migrate to save up for a house here.  Since the utility of that real estate is way lower for the foreign rich than for the local poor, I claim that in this case raw capitalism is reducing overall value.",1184947283

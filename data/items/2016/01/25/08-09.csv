10966243,comment,10963916,10965702,0,0,_Codemonkeyism,,,"&quot;And how in the world does Twitter have 4300 employees? The product should be sustainable with less than 10% of that.&quot;<p>Assumption for this comment: many of them are working in engineering.<p>I have thought about this for some years. I have no explaination yet, some hypothesis though. Many CEOs and VCs think engineering is key. CEOs don&#x27;t know how many engineers they need. So often they have as many as they can afford and are rarely challenged for that. I&#x27;ve seen many companies where I look at a Kanban/Scrum board for the features and think &quot;Hu? This is what they working on?&quot;, a lot of features have no impact. Number of features seems to be a function of number of engineers not number of good ideas (with impact). So there is no downward pressure on the number of engineers, work fills the over capacity. This leads to 4300 employees.<p>But far from sure, still wondering about that mystery of high employee numbers of many companies.",1453712318

I don&#x27;t get how you&#x27;d say with a straight face that you shipped a product when what you actually did was go around with a questionnaire.<p>> How do you do know if it&#x27;s &quot;smallest&quot; or &quot;viable&quot;?<p>You explicitly chose situations where there were extra, unused features and where the product as a whole was completely useless. If you have a product with more features than you needed, you can&#x27;t really say you succeeded in making the <i>minimum</i> viable product, and if you have a product nobody wants is it really sensible to refer to it as a viable product?<p>Is the startup world at such a point that nobody knows what might constitute a viable product? Sure, there&#x27;s some blurred points around not-yet-profitable-but-growing things, but if your target audience finds your thing absolutely useless is it really that unclear?<p>> Walk me through your process.<p>Again, I have no problem with the process and it&#x27;s a shame this has picked up so much attention instead of actual discussion around that. I just don&#x27;t want to have to deal with the following conversations:<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve built an MVP&quot;<p>&quot;Great! How did the launch go?&quot;<p>&quot;Launch? Oh my no, we&#x27;ve just finished a focus group session. The next MVP is at 4pm if you want to sit in.&quot;<p>> I think it&#x27;s fair to say that you need more than an acronym to understand what to do.<p>Yes, this is true, which is surely why we already have terms like market research. I just don&#x27;t understand what benefit calling market research &quot;building an MVP&quot; has.<p>My initial criticism was that you&#x27;d redefined what I thought was a well understood term. If I&#x27;m wrong about that (which I seem to be) then I&#x27;d change my criticism to &quot;If something is poorly understood, please don&#x27;t redefine it to mean something different <i>again</i>&quot;. When I see a title like &quot;X isn&#x27;t X, it&#x27;s Y&quot; my immediate thought is that someone is trying to give an old idea a new name to make it more current and sexy, that may not be fair but it&#x27;s my first reaction to this kind of thing.<p>Perhaps I just need to step back from all this for a while. Perhaps in this world you really can refer to a marketing video as a viable product, and I&#x27;m a crazed outsider.

As far as I can tell Zappos still has a CEO.<p>I also think the divide people are commenting about between manager and creator is a red flag for a bad organization.  If you are managing programers you should still be writing code a few layers up (same for other creators or operators).  The “I’m a people person” argument doesn’t hold by itself.  The Commanding Officers of the fighter squadrons I served in flew a lot and also managed 300-700 people.  Certainly managers (or ‘leaders’) need to spend time on higher level issues and looking after the team, but they should still be able to operate / create enough to understand what is going on and lead people in the execution of the job.  Sure, when the captain or admiral went flying it was more of a token gesture, but when you have a carrier and 5k people to look after or an entire battle group, well at that point keeping all the balls moving is challenging enough.<p>But a small to mid size team—if you can’t operate why should operators follow you?  While certain management skills are transferable, just because you lead a team of programmers doesn’t mean you can lead a team of SEALs or vice versa.  Operational experience and ability to execute are important and an MBA isn’t a substitute.   Presidents of sales are still involved in selling.  Why is it on the technical side where people seem to either stop executing and manage or just be a ‘creator’.  Like I said, now that I’m a programmer, this is a red flag for me.  Although, to be fair so is the other extreme, the super coding leader with 40 people reporting to him and no time to talk to anyone.   One-on-ones every other year!

I have referenced a large number of their publications in my source code.<p>With that said, if you were familiar with the source code and APIs of both libraries, I think that you would see a clear benefit. This is supported by the way that Elemental is growing and arguably has <i>more</i> functionality than ScaLAPACK (with the notable exception being a parallel Schur decomposition).

6111385,comment,6110602,6110602,18,0,phy6,,,"I attended one of his day long seminars recently, and I was displeased with the lack of breadth and depth.  Sure, he rails against PowerPoints like no other, we get that.  My biggest issue is that everything he presented was from someone else-- he&#x27;s literally just aggregating other people&#x27;s work and postulating on them with fuzzy emotional thoughts-- and barely anything applies to dynamic, user driven displays such as you would find on a web dashboard.<p>How to save yourself $300 hundred dollars AKA My half page of notes from the seminar:<p>0) Get the books on eBay or Amazon if you _really_ want them.<p>1) Don&#x27;t use PowerPoint.  Try to convince your viewers to browse a web page as the presentation, after you&#x27;ve convinced your IT staff to set up a web server for your presentation.<p>2) Look at ESPN.com, Weather.gov and Google News and Google Maps if you want to see what he thinks are the pinnacle of data presentations on the web.  This will save you a few hours.<p>3) &quot;Use verbs not Nouns&quot;\n  Show comparisons and mechanisms.<p>4) &quot;Do whatever it takes to express the information&quot;<p>5) &quot;Show interaction between objects&quot;<p>6) &quot;Don&#x27;t use boxes or drop shadows&quot;.  Avoid &quot;Chart Junk&quot;<p>7) &quot;Use small multiples&quot; (he peddled his spark lines and ESPN&#x27;s groups of stats)<p>8) Make paper based, text presentations and supply that to people as the arrive at the meeting.  This way they can read that before jumping in with questions.  The paper allows them to skip ahead and read what they want to know about so they don&#x27;t interrupt you.<p>9) Calm the f2ck down when you go to meetings.  He spent about an hour giving a lame rendition of How to Win Friends and Influence People.  In one sentence:  Be nice, be patient, be persuasive.<p>10) Ask yourself:<p>==1) &quot;What&#x27;s the problem?&quot;<p>==2) &quot;Why does it matter?&quot;<p>==3) &quot;What are you going to do about it?&quot;<p>Other issues I had with his seminar:<p>1) I disliked the way he was surrounded by his thug ushers, who seemed to comb the aisles looking for someone or some thing.  It made me feel like I was at a cult meeting or that they were worried about someone recording the seminar.<p>2) I disliked his peddling of his mother&#x27;s book and his sculptures.<p>3) His dour emotional expressions about not wanting to teach government how to visualize things (This meeting was in Arlington VA, so I&#x27;m sure there were lots of military folks/contractors) in wake of the leaks.  That&#x27;s fine but now you look like a sellout, &#x27;teaching&#x27; them anyway.<p>4) The multiple videos presentations about visualizing musical data.  That&#x27;s cute, but the guy is off his rocker if he thinks people are going to use that in place of a traditional presentation.<p>5) The repeated videos.  I think we watched the same video three times of a Swiss topological map with an ethnic female voice narrating.  By the second time I was already thinking to myself &#x27;I wish he would stop wasting my time with that&#x27;.<p>6) I understand there is a cult of personality around him, and I generally thought highly of his name until I went to the seminar.  A coworker who went a few months before me told me it wasn&#x27;t worth the time, but it was the cult of personality that caused me to go.  He ended up pretty much being a douche in person.  Not one visualization we saw was created by him, he is literally curating other&#x27;s great works, and for that, you can pick up used books on your own or visit a library.<p>7) All in all it felt way too touchy-feely and not very concrete.  He only _briefly_ made mention of R and D3, saying they were high end, advanced visualization tools, that we as an audience shouldn&#x27;t be using, because they are too complex. WTF.<p>8) Things that are NOT covered:\na) Moving data, aside from his video visualization of music that he found somewhere.\nb) Visualizaing dynamic graphs or Sankeys. \nc) Interactive displays, such as on a website for users to use.  The closest he came was to extol the virtues of ESPN.  He literally recommended to bring up your presentations to the level of ESPN.com, and you&#x27;d meet with success.<p>TLDR; To each his own, but I wish I had my day back.",1374886365

Any of these parts may have bugs, some of those bugs may be significant.  There&#x27;s also the possibility for different pieces of functionality interacting in poor ways.<p>The more a piece of a system has been used to build things, the more confident you can be that it doesn&#x27;t have bugs that will be getting in your way.  The more similar these things are to what you&#x27;re planning on doing, the more confident you can be that things won&#x27;t get in your way.  What the thresholds should be depends on the particular tech, your particular project, and the world around it.  Maturity is absolutely something that should be traded away when there is sufficient reason.<p>This is by no means lazy or unintellectual unless you&#x27;re using it as an excuse not to work (or learn) or not to think.<p>Regarding your implicit concern about no one being the one to step up and shoulder the burden of trying new things in production, I reiterate my assertion that maturity is just one factor that should be used in determining technology choice, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with those first venturing to new things those who have the most to gain by their use.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;d like to note that I <i>am presently</i> writing a web application in Haskell, so I obviously don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a poor fit for all web projects.",1374885900

Humans are by-and-large highly <i>IN</i>sensitive to long electromagnetic waves (radio) until the waves become short enough to heat burn your skin (infrared, lasers) or your retinas. There&#x27;s evidence of cancer at high exposures to short wavelengths, but causing cancer is not viable as a combat tactic.<p>But if you&#x27;re going to deploy a directed energy weapon, you&#x27;re going to want to have a reasonable idea of the effect on both electronics and the humans in the target area. They have a test range built for this. So it sounds to me like they need some help studying the effect of EMP weapons on people with pacemakers who might just happen to be in the target area. In other words:<p>Are these non-lethal weapons systems? If not, just how lethal are they?<p>Should we let an experienced officer continue to serve on a surface ship after he needs a pacemaker? Would he need any special precautions?<p>If someone dropped one on us, how many civilian casualties would we sustain?

If everything was doctrinal and academic, bad facts wouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>FWIW: The FISA authorization is completely and totally irrelevant in this case.  Entirely.  The fact that the FISA court said &quot;sure, whatever&quot; does not make something <i>legal</i>, only <i>authorized</i>, because they are not ruling on a constitutional challenge, only the validity of a search warrant.

6111258,comment,6110671,6111100,1,0,mrbrowning,,,"Big-O (or  or ) notation is orthogonal to notions of best-case or worst-case, which are merely constraints on the set of inputs we&#x27;re considering. If, for example, you ask &quot;what is the upper bound on best-case running time for linear search,&quot; then what you&#x27;re actually asking is &quot;<i>given an input sequence that begins with the item being searched for</i>, what is the upper bound on the running time.&quot; I think part of the confusion stems from the fact that when people supply bounds on best- or worst-case running times for deterministic algorithms, they often use Big-O notation when they&#x27;re actually giving an asymptotically tight bound. So in the case of linear search&#x27;s best case, O(1) is an upper bound, but the lower bound is of the same order, i.e. (1). It&#x27;s not incorrect, but it can be misleading.<p>In the case of Quicksort, I think the answer to your question is yeah, pretty much. I mean, cases where you&#x27;re dealing with nearly-sorted input are common in some domains and in that case you should be very much aware of the worst-case behavior of Quicksort, but otherwise I think the discussion from CLRS puts things in perspective: even if you had the bad luck of only ever receiving input sequences such that every partitioning led to a 99-to-1 split, then your running time is still going to be O(n lg n), since your recursion tree is going to be at most log-base-100/99(n) levels tall, which is the same as lg n / (lg 100/99), the denominator there being a constant factor that disappears in an asymptotic context.",1374883818

He never improves his lot, he either has no desire to, or no ability to. If no desire to, he is a loser. If no ability to, he is under the mistaken impression he is far smarter and more capable then he is, which means he is also a deluded loser.<p>(and yes, I know its a cartoon !).<p>But it does bug me a bit - instead of people feeling sorry for themselves (as the cartoon seems to help people who are coping with grey corporate existence) why not encourage people to change their environment (either bit by bit, or just improving yourself, starting something, finding something, anything).<p>Dilbert is a loser, feel sorry for him but don't relate to him or else become him.",1256032729

I personally would not like a tech event with go go dancers either. I just think it was drawn out of proportion to compare it with racism and slavery.<p>And sorry, but cheerleading is almost the same as go go dancing. From the photos, I didn't get the impression that the dancers were actually stripping. Again, I don't want to defend the use of it at a tech event, but it annoys me that there is the assumption that all women would automatically have to be offended. in fact, many men would also be offended - some would like it, some would be offended.

I.e. qmail has separate binaries for inbound smtp, pop3, managing the queue, local delivery, remote delivery and more.\n- Make each part of the system communicate only via well defined interfaces (using pipes in qmail) where it is explicitly assumed that you can't really trust the sender.\n- Don't ever use library functions that don't length check things.

I'm one of the many people who feels search results have gotten worse, but since I don't have any actual saved search results from 10 years ago it's really hard to say if I'm right or misremembering. Some concrete examples of what Google2000 looked like might be good for jogging the memory.<p>One example category does come to mind, which is a frequent pet peeve: lyrics searches. They definitely return sort of crappy results currently, but I can't say for sure what they returned in 2000, since I didn't save any results.<p>Examples:<p>Imo [joy division walked in line lyrics] should return a page like <a href=""http://www.joydiv.org/shadowplay/joyd/walkedline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joydiv.org/shadowplay/joyd/walkedline.html</a>.

An example of that: [vnv nation fragments lyrics] should return <a href=""http://www.vnvnation.com/Webfiles/lyrics/fragments.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vnvnation.com/Webfiles/lyrics/fragments.htm</a>, but instead it again returns the usual lyrics-site suspects.<p>I <i>think</i> my recollection is that I used to get fan sites more than lyrics aggregators in 2000. That might be more due to web changes than Google changes, admittedly, since many of these lyrics aggregators didn't exist in 2000, and hobbyist fan sites may have been more vibrant. The fact that the <i>same</i> lyrics-aggregator sites dominate for almost all the searches seems weird, though; it seems that basically all lyrics searches return ""big lyrics site"", rather than trying to retrieve a site specializing in the band I searched for.",1284449829

I’m just familiar with a handful of PHP, HTML, and CSS.<p>2. I used WordPress in a bizarre way with appropriately licensed plugins and some of my own modifications with the WordPress core and plugin files. It’s not a blog.<p>3. I've compiled what I think is a decent prototype. That is, it's a site that does exactly what it's supposed to do and it has some nice features. I’m just sure its source is incredibly atrocious and wasteful.<p>Questions:<p>So, given my inexperience and coding displeasure do you think any technical co-founder could be interested in working with me? They would want to ditch WordPress right? So what would be the point if they could just come up with their own similar project with their own neat and appropriate code? Would any investors be interested once I find a technical co-founder? They wouldn't be interested if I didn’t have one, right?<p>Just wondering if my work on such a project is meaningful in any way or if it’s mostly been a waste of time as far as serious business goes. I suppose I may just stick entirely with law school if that’s the case.<p>Thanks for your time. I really appreciate it.<p>Edit: Just stumbled across this recent submission and found it enlightening: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1689751",1284448395

Of course, that may mean that you need to charge more for your service, but I know plenty of people that would happily pay a surcharge of 20% or so on their doctor/dentist visits if it meant that they wouldn't have to be sitting around in a waiting room for an hour.<p>The curious thing about it is that it would only need to be about 20% to get everyone clear, but instead of that, nearly every patient ends up needing to wait for an hour, because there is <i>always</i> an emergency that needs addressing each day.  I wonder why we don't see doctor's surgeries or dentists doing this.  Anyone have an idea?",1284447932

It might cost a little extra, but it also wouldn't completely screw over a bunch of small developers. Developers who already paid money to Apple and further invested their time and money into making an application.<p>Based of how prevalent iPhone app rejections are, you would think the least Apple could do would be to release a comprehensive list of things they do not like.<p>Would it really cost 'TONS' of effort just to create a set of guidelines and stick to them?",1243155395
624231,comment,624202,624217,0,0,spitfire,,,"The video he posted is particularly germane to HN.
Here we get dozens of posts a day telling us how we should
do things. Mainly, I'm convinced, by people who haven't done
things themselves. Cultivating taste would help a lot of people
here.<p>But even if they have done things, having done something doesn't
necessarily give you knowledge to pass on to others. Ask any guy 
who's <i>really</i> <i>really</i> good with women how he does it. The answer 
will probably be ""just be yourself"" (Unless the answer is ""Ferrari"".)<p>Point being, you may not know what you know. Even if you're successful
you may not know what has made you successful. So ""just shut up
and do it"" isn't horrible advice.",1243155365

(I think almost nobody knows this happens.)<p>Two bids of 5 cents and $1 (eBay): the bid of $1 wins.<p>Two bids of 5 cents and $1 (Google): the side who Google says wins, wins, at a price which is somewhere between 0 cents and $1.",1243155168

So, from your excerpts, it appears he's saying something to the effect of ""do what needs to be done, even if it feels uncomfortable"".",1243154390

624212,comment,624202,624202,0,0,swombat,,,"That's a pretty silly point.<p>""Just do it""? ""Don't bother to analyze things""? Yeah, that really sounds like a recipe for success.<p>The author even contradicts himself within the article:<p><i>Take whatever action you feel needs to be done to grow your business. Do whatever you feel you should do to make your relationship work the best you can.</i><p>+<p><i>What is the right thing to do is usually difficult to commit to because it doesn’t feel comfortable. It tests your willpower and how much you can trust your own judgment.</i><p>So you're supposed to do what <i>feels</i> right... even when it <i>doesn't feel</i> right?<p>I'm not trying to put down the importance of gut feeling and intuition, but jumping into everything without thinking is not, imho, the way to business success. There is such a thing as too much analysis - and there is such a thing as too little analysis.",1243152819
624211,comment,624058,624149,0,0,koepked,,,"The highest bid does win every time, if you realize that a bid in this situation constitutes more than just price. Price is one way to motivate a seller to perform a service for you. In this case, another way is to have a great site to match your service, which contributes to the overall reputation of the AdWords program. There are also other ways to motivate, and all the secret sauce you commented on is probably to handle them. Add up all of this motivation and call it a bid, and the highest bid wins always, even though the highest price may not.",1243152739

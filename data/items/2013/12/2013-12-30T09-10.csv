Microsoft can&#x27;t be _that_ fragmented, I would hope.)<p>The discussion thread on LtU hasn&#x27;t pick up much steam, probably due to mid-holiday lull. I&#x27;m still a but confused about Charles Torre&#x27;s comments re: HN/Reddit speculation. D and Rust were brought up in the the main source blog post [2], not by random speculators. He&#x27;s right that we don&#x27;t have &quot;many of the details required to make intelligent comparisons&quot;, which is a shame. Charles also states in the comment<p>> &quot;Joe mentioned his desire for openness for the technology (as in open source AND open communication/transparency).

The UK doesn&#x27;t have any of those things because they have big daddy USA protecting them if the need arises.<p>India does not have anyone to protect her against China or Pakistan. In fact, China has been phenomenally increasing it&#x27;s naval concentration in the Indian ocean. India has failed to grow an indigenous military industry (except for nukes and some other stuff..) and this has resulted in India becoming the largest purchaser of weapons worldwide. Definitely not a title I am proud of.<p>Geopolitics is complex. It could be argued that had the US/UK not &#x27;enabled&#x27; Pakistan back in the day we wouldn&#x27;t have this problem today. It was good for western nations to have an ally in this region against Russia and thus Afghanistan during the cold war era.<p>But I&#x27;d like to add. On the subject of our space program. Our president a few terms ago was a fisherman&#x27;s son (and he was from a very poor family..) who eventually went on to become a rocket scientist and then later the president of the country.<p>We are working on poverty, a one sided perspective on such a complex issue doesn&#x27;t do it justice. We need the space program as much as we need to improve food distribution. And we have enough people to work on many problems simultaneously.<p>I can understand that as someone from the UK you are upset because your government insists on giving aid to India. But the aid issue is politicized greatly. India has said several times that we do not want the aid but political forces in both countries have resulted in the continuation of aid. I can see how the UK media might spin that into &#x27;Oh, we give them aid and they make missiles&#x27;. All I can say to that is, it&#x27;s not true. I&#x27;d encourage anyone to research this more to arrive at the real facts. We don&#x27;t make nukes with aid money.",1388397303

We can take in the information from this method, but we can also spread this information, or &quot;spend our conversational credits&quot; with the device as well, with other people linked to us by their similar devices.<p>A person on a device is commonly networking with a very large group of other people, and the information exchange is nearly never one way. Humans like to receive feedback on information they receive. This gives us a wider perspective that is further detached from ourselves, and is generally more well-rounded in regards to the opinions the rest of the world shares.<p>People now use devices like this, to gain a larger amount of opinions so to form their own views. As humans, that feedback loop with other humans is necessary.<p>The problem : It has not been sufficiently shown to me that we are capable of honoring both information sources very well at once.

Which seems irrelevant to the argument, but turns up 4 or 5 times in the paper.<p>3) Gitless is amazing because it doesn&#x27;t have the concept of staged changes. See (2) about how the author really likes this:<p><pre><code>    The elimination of the staging area was enthusiastically received as a\n    major reduction in complexity, though one student missed being able to\n    stage files and then only diff those staged files prior to committing \n    (using git diff --staged). We believe this to be a limitation not so much\n    in the conceptual model of Gitless but rather in the detailed functionality \n    of the gl diff command, which appears to be insufficiently versatile.\n</code></pre>\nWell, I believe the author would be more plausible if they didn&#x27;t have a clear bias towards a result they favoured.<p>How about looking up, for example, a bunch of things that people use staging for, and then objectively evaluating those, compared to the alternative in a &#x27;no staging&#x27; world?<p>Perhaps you could also include potential limitations of using the orthogonal/general/propriety comparison as the <i>single test</i> for evaluating features?

The head of a pin is a sixteenth of an inch across. If you magnify it by 25,000 diameters, the area of the head of the pin is then equal to the area of all the pages of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica. Therefore, all it is necessary to do is to reduce in size all the writing in the Encyclopaedia by 25,000 times. Is that possible? The resolving power of the eye is about 1/120 of an inch – that is roughly the diameter of one of the little dots on the fine half-tone reproductions in the Encyclopaedia. This, when you demagnify it by 25,000 times, is still 80 angstroms in diameter – 32 atoms across, in an ordinary metal. In other words, one of those dots still would contain in its area 1,000 atoms. So, each dot can easily be adjusted in size as required by the photoengraving, and there is no question that there is enough room on the head of a pin to put all of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica.&quot;</i><p>By his assumption, a pinhead is about 0.003 inches^2 (2 mm^2). The current <i>Encylopedia Brittanica</i> has about 300 million English characters [0], which is about 300 MB in a reasonable text encoding (although it should compress [1] to around 60 MB). So, what Feynman is speculating about, translates in digital language to a memory density of 300 MB/(0.003 in^2) or 100 GB/in^2 or 800 Gb/in^2. This is roughly an average magnetic HDD from 2011 [2].<p>To emphasize the point: Feynman is speculating about a dot <i>&quot;80 angstroms [8 nanometers] in diameter - 32 atoms across, in an ordinary metal&quot;</i>. This is actually the size of a magnetic domain on a HDD platter -- wikipedia gives it as 10 nm [3].<p>Unfortunately, there now exists a far larger English-language encyclopedia which is 9 GB compressed [4] or 75 GB with images [5]. Using Wikipedia as the new benchmark, it is currently <i>not</i> possible to compress it onto the head of a pin.<p>[0] <a href""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_comparisons#Comparison_of_encyclopedia"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_comparisons#Com...</a><p>[1] <a href""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29#Introductio"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%...</a> (&quot;1.5 bits per character&quot;)<p>[2] <a href""http://storageconference.org/2013/Papers/2013.Paper.01.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://storageconference.org/2013/Papers/2013.Paper.01.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_storage#Desig"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_storage#Design</a> (&quot;Magnetic grains are typically 10 nm in size...&quot;)<p>[4] <a href""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#English-language_Wikipedi"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#En...</a><p>[5] <a href""http://xowa.sourceforge.net/image_dbs.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://xowa.sourceforge.net/image_dbs.html</a>",1388396220

It also doesn&#x27;t mean that the aggregate value of the results is small.<p>Many/most papers present useless (to society) results that only appear meaningful when viewed in a very narrow light. Again, that&#x27;s not really a problem: just like the startup world, science has a very low yield of very high value results. Scope-narrowing is actually a method which allows us to avoid unjustly punishing legitimate null results. A feature, not a bug. Also, what appears to be narrow scope to an outsider might be of incredible importance to someone who has a better sense of perspective. Many of today&#x27;s most important innovations would be impossible without thousands of yesterday&#x27;s &quot;useless&quot; results.<p>You aren&#x27;t crazy, but you are missing the big picture.<p>To work around paywalls, try emailing authors, visiting /r/scholar, making friends at academic institutions, or getting a side-job that will permit you journal access.",1388395484

6983807,comment,6983566,6983566,21,0,stiff,,,"This seems to boil down to a criticism of the staging area, so it is strange its purpose is never clearly explained in the paper. The reason why the staging area exists, is, I think, that for larger teams working long term on a code-base, it is crucially important for the version control history to be very, very neat, with logically separate changes in separate commits, with very clean commit messages for each change, with the right changes going to the right branch (eg. you don&#x27;t want to commit a change that can go live immediately to a branch that&#x27;s going to be released in 3 months) and so on. That&#x27;s also why git makes rebase such a big deal, I guess Linus spends a lot of time getting people to use the VCS right even after the changes themselves are more or less right, and thanks to rebase and the distributed model he at all is able to do corrections related to version control and branch/release management before changes enter the main repository.<p>People aren&#x27;t really good in remembering about those things up front, that&#x27;s why Git introduces the staging area, so that you can work as usual and only after you are finished with whatever was occupying your mind you can consider splitting your work into nice commits, which can be quite a task in itself to do right. If you remove the staging area, and want to incrementally build up a few commits from the changes you made, you end up having to pass in again and again a lot of parameters to the commands executed, first to git diff, then to git commit, and it&#x27;s easy to do a mistake and diff something other than the changes that will actually be comitted in the end.<p>A lot of people, especially in small teams, use version control very sloppily, and then get confused about conflicts, changes are hard to track down in history etc. Remember that Git was build for maintaining Linux, which has an absolutely huge number of people working in parallel - in this case you really, really have to care about using the VCS tidily, actually understanding its concepts very well, and not just churn away commits, or you will just fail to integrate the changes correctly. So, frankly, while I like the general discussion in this paper and its approach, it seems to me a bit confused with respect to Git, I wonder whether the authors have any experience in doing long-term software development in a team and especially doing software <i>integration</i> and in using a VCS for that purpose. Once you have a few people, or more than one team working on a project, a few testing servers, and a few different release branches, the concepts in Git do make a lot of sense.",1388395426

Even if they're great, it makes it difficult for me to judge if it's even worth our time to investigate further. Anyone who's used them want to share feedback as to how they compare rate-wise with other providers?",1211651929

198916,comment,198732,198809,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Agreed completely. But how do you get more information cheaply?<p>Remember, all you know is P(qualified| <i>resume says</i> autodidactic)= P(qualified | autodidactic) * P(autodidactic | <i>resume says</i> autodidactic) . The second term can easily kill you. Do you trust everything people put on their resume?<p>On the other hand, P(degree | <i>resume says</i> degree) is probably close to 1, since a degree is so easy for an HR person to check.<p>Look, I've got nothing against hiring good people who have no degree, and I certainly don't think a degree proves much (my current students prove that conclusively). If you know you have such a good person, hire them, ignore the degree.<p>I'm just pointing out that the game is to find the good people. And that's a bit tricky to do.<p>[edit: by this way, in the interest of clarifying, what you want to optimize is not candidate quality, but (candidate quality - search costs). Don't ignore the search costs term.]",1211651522
198915,comment,198732,198847,0,0,Tichy,,,"And what is the reason you did not want to study? Just trying to understand... Obviously, it is a money issue (earning 3 years vs paying 3 years). But if you enjoy the stuff, wouldn't it be natural to study it?<p>For example, personally I am bored by now by web programming, and university really wasn't so much about practical programming. I liked the theory, complexity of algorithms and so on. in your self-taught curriculum, did you ever come across those kinds of things? Do you/did you care? If you are truly interested in that stuff, but don't want to spend the money, why not do it in a remote learning course or something? I mean, you want to learn the stuff anyway, why not get credit for it?<p>Obviously it is better to create a new distributed hashing algorithm by creating something like bittorrent, rather than doing theoretical work about it at university. But university is not so bad, and some results from academia do spill over into the real world.<p>Just today a friend told me about a program he got to analyze that did user authentication on the client. It is amazing to me that people can be able to program such Java clients, yet be unable to understand the security issue. They can program, yet they can not program. Maybe it is because it is so easy to learn programming, and bad code actually runs, too, that employers like to see some additional verification like a CS degree (and of course the CS degree is not guarantee stuff like that won't happen).",1211651514
198914,comment,198732,198732,0,0,joiningdots,,,"The degree is seen as a benchmark, an easy early filter - you know someone with a degree has had the focus to knuckle down and study a subject in depth for a period of time. Frustrating for those who don't have a degree but have done the same amount of studying, if not more. But that's the way it goes.<p>You're only 24. If it's bothering you, go get a degree.

Successfully completing college does not mean you are good at finishing things.  It may be an indicator, it's certainly not a qualifier.<p>Many jocks finish college while barely being able to read, many students cheat their way through, or barely make it through with low grades.  Going to college is much more an indicator of your social values rather than your skills.<p>Most people tend to go to college because they're expected to, it has a lot to do with the values your parent instill.  Many people skip college because it never occurred to them they should go, their families simply didn't instill those values in them.<p>College is nothing more than a place where one <i>can</i> learn, it does not mean one does learn.  People who enjoy learning don't ever stop learning and self learning eventually becomes a requirement for all who want to continue to grow.  College is nothing more than a kick start for a minority of society, there are many other paths that are just as successful.<p>Many of the most successful companies in the world were started by college dropouts who realized school <i>was</i> getting in their way.  Classrooms are good for teaching the masses, people who learn faster than average <i>will</i> absolutely feel like they're being held back and turn to self directed learning as the superior method it is.",1211651000

198904,comment,198732,198732,0,0,aseever,,,"When you were 16 did you know that employers use a college degree as a coarse filter when trying to get a manageable applicant pool? It would seem that your answer was most likely one of two. You were either ignorant of reality when making a huge decision, or you were the type to want to fight reality because it felt like injustice and you 'knew better'. Of course at 16 we all 'knew better' and if that's how it went down I'm sorry you didn't get better advice... but it's a personality trait that some folks don't grow out of, and if you've ever managed a team you know they aren't the ones you want to have around.<p>Anyway, this is not to make any sort of judgment on you  personally, you have probably done more awesome things than most 24 year olds and may be nothing like what I described, but you asked: when an employer sees a resume without a degree that's a snap decision thought process they might go through.<p>The situation actually isn't that bad... most of the best jobs aren't ""resume"" jobs, they're ""hey I know a guy"" jobs.

Not going the normal path, where you're not guided through, the route isn't clear, you have to make decisions, and take actions on your own accord.<p>Does that not demonstrate an ability to execute?<p>I have always encountered jobs on the standard job market that require degrees, and I just thought that was how it was.

198895,comment,198746,198746,0,0,swombat,,,"As someone who has developed FB apps, I have to agree, and add that not only are most users (myself included) jaded to the Facebook Apps and their diarrhea of invitations and notifications, but facebook app developers themselves are wary of trusting facebook with their time, effort, etc.<p>There's a few reasons:
- The main point of developing a facebook app was to reach a lot of users very quickly and cheaply. Now that Facebook has mercilessly nerfed all the viral features of applications, is there any point in tying your app to FB?
- The FB platform has proved notoriously unreliable and requiring constant tweaking and oversight by app developers to keep their apps working with the latest backwards-incompatible changes that FB brought in.
- The FB platform features themselves have fairly often been unreliable, with the standard error displayed to users blaming the application developers even when it was facebook's fault (e.g. when they broke their own FBJS)<p>These and many things mean that myself and a number of people I know who used to develop FB apps would not consider doing so in the future.",1211649905

I ABSOLUTELY would hire a person who did not go to college if he was qualified. But a person who drops out of college because he felt the classes where holding him back is for me a person who cannot complete stuff.<p>If he dropped out to execute something (like start a business), then it is a major plus point. If he dropped out to go work in a dead end job, or to become an 'artist' then this is a sign of a person who cannot complete projects.<p>I mean, why would you drop out of college to go earn $3000 a month when you could just finish college and earn more than that?<p>I would NEVER discriminate against a person because financially they had trouble going to college. But I would see it as very negative if a person complained about college not being the right thing for them. Learning is learning, there is no right or wrong way.

I am not shortchanging the value whatsoever.<p>I think being autodidactic is incredibly valuable - but I don't believe whether or not you have a degree is a good indicator of that.  That skill is also incredibly hard to determine from a resume or interview.  When you are hiring commonly you have once piece of paper to look at and then a 30 minute interview to evaluate the person.  Whether you like it or not, the majority of people doing this will filter by degree and institution.  If you can think of a better process, create a HR startup I am sure it would be amazingly successful!

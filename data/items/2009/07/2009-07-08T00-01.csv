692987,comment,690920,692545,0,0,anamax,,,"> In WW2, the U.S. was attacked.<p>Not by Germany or Italy.  (Yes, they were attacking ships that were supplying the UK, but that's not really an attack on the US.)<p>> In WW2 it was quite obvious there was a threat to the U.S., and to the entire world.<p>Revisionist twaddle.  I think that WWII was a ""good war"", but by the standards you asserted above, you don't.  If you don't like the results of your standards, you have to change them, not ignore them.<p>> It's tough.<p>It was easy just a message ago.<p>Decisions can't be made in hindsight.<p>> The U.S. needed to kill the entire population to win [the Vietnam] war.<p>Nope.  The US merely needed to consolidate the Tet gains, which wiped out the VC.  The NVA wasn't ready at the time.  (What?  You think that Tet was a US military defeat?  It wasn't.  It was a US political defeat in the US, but that's a different argument.)<p>I'm not going to call you on the back-pedaling but I do suggest a bit of research.",1247014659

I know that TPSs are a stand-in for a number of political values, but I have to say that emphasizing political values and the status quo is quite disappointing when it comes to the development of childrens&#x27; potential.  In an age of rapidly improving communications, with responsive websites and machine learning, as well as the massive budgets devoted to &#x27;education&#x27;, we should be able to do better than small incremental improvements to a model of schooling developed hundreds of years ago.<p>Perhaps this article is a symptom of Thiel&#x27;s diagnosis in &quot;Zero to One&quot;, that people do not believe that things can be drastically improved, so they rely on incrementalism and a refusal to believe in anything specific.  Another possibility is that the author is simply trying to defend the status quo against change, and appealing to cynicism and doubt to achieve this ends.  I am not sure which possibility I find more distressing.",1452409195

To to a full reset you had to turn it off, wait about 5 seconds and turn it on again. If you did not wait the RAM was at least partly preserved. The C64 had no dedicated video RAM, the VIC just read from regular RAM.\nSo if you did the power cycle quickly enough the screen was preserved.<p>Another effect of the screen RAM being regular RAM was that you actually could run programs in it while it was being displayed. You could watch a program run in the literal sense. This was often used by unpackers. The unpacker run in the screen RAM, filling the rest of the RAM. After its job was done the game started and filled the screen RAM with graphics destroying the unpacker.<p>EDIT: Found a video showing activity in the screen RAM of a C64. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the unpacker or this is really code execution, but it looks similar how I remember it.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nDzFsCEZT8&feature=youtu.be&t=92"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nDzFsCEZT8&feature=youtu.be...</a>",1452409171

The most obvious operation is multiply-accumulate, which would map to either multiply + add instructions, multiply-add instruction (with intermediate rounding), or FMA instruction. For a linear algebra (BLAS) library, it would be a one-minute fix to make use of this operation, and it would double performance on modern CPUs.<p>2. Another kind of operations I would like to see is load-and-deinterleave/store-and-interleave, e.g. operation which loads 12 floats of interleaved RGB data and returns 3 Float32x4 vectors with red, green, blue components. These operations map to a single instruction on ARM, and map to a nice sequence of instruction on x86 with SSSE3, and to a much longer sequence of instructions on x86 with SSE2. The best a developer can do with the current SIMD.js API is the analog of very suboptimal SSE2 code.<p>3. Operations which extend the type, e.g. load 4 16-bit signed integers and extend them to 4x32 vector. The optimal sequence is:<p>- PMOVSXWD xmm, [mem] on x86 with SSE 4.1<p>- MOVQ xmm, [mem] + PXOR xmm2, xmm2 + PCMPGTB xmm2, xmm + PUNPCKLBW xmm, xmm2 on x86 with SSE2<p>- VLD1.16 dTemp, [rAddr] + VMOVL.S16 qOut, dTemp on ARMv7.<p>The best the developer can do with SIMD.js now is SSE2 approach.<p>If you are interested in these ideas, I have more operations in mind that would be useful.",1452407164

The further out in NYC you go the <i>less able</i> people are to afford higher fares, but yet that is exactly what a zone system does.<p>And like most other direct subsidies, the subsidized MetroCards are a terrifyingly bad solution to this - for one thing in a zone system, even with subsidies, the poor will still end up paying dramatically more than they do today to get to work. Not only that, only the poorest of the poor even qualify for these MetroCards, leaving out a vast income range for whom transit costs are still a burden and a substantial portion of income.<p>A zone system with subsidies will likely end up looking like:<p>- The extreme poor pay slightly more than they do today because of the combination of living very far and subsidization.<p>- The &quot;merely&quot; poor pay dramatically (possibly 2x+ multiples) more than they do today because they are &quot;too rich&quot; to qualify for subsidization but yet live at the outer reaches of the transit system.<p>- Middle income individuals pay more than they do today, they don&#x27;t qualify for subsidy but they live > 1 zone from work.<p>- Upper/upper middle class individuals pay similar or slightly more than they do today, because they don&#x27;t qualify for subsidy but are likely to live within the same zone as work (i.e., Manhattan below 110th).<p>A zone system, even with subsidies, will be insanely regressive to the point of comical absurdity.<p>Ignoring the fact that it&#x27;s incredibly regressive, the zone system also won&#x27;t do much against the budget issues the MTA faces - if you&#x27;re going to squeeze someone for money you don&#x27;t squeeze the residents of Brighton Beach or Bay Ridge or Hunts Point or Elmhurst - they don&#x27;t got any money left to be squeezed out.

This has resulted in the city&#x27;s transit budgets being routinely raided to supplement state budget needs, and also a focus on state-centric mass transit efforts to the detriment of in-city mass transit (see: redeveloping Penn Station which serves long-distance train commuters, designing the AirTrain to LaGuardia to primarily serve suburban Long Island travelers, etc).<p>There&#x27;s a pretty dramatic misalignment of incentives when a state agency under the command of the governor runs the city&#x27;s subways, rather than the mayor or even a regional government.",1452405718

In the real world these don&#x27;t exist, and the field of statistics has devoted extensive effort to the problem of getting good answers out of bad inputs.<p>E.g., for an unbiased measurement (m = x+g, g ~ N(0,\sigma^2)), you use the likelihood function G(x-m,\sigma^2). For a biased measurement g ~ N(b, \sigma^2), you use the likelihood function G(x-m+b, \sigma^2). Here G(x,\sigma^2) is the pdf of the distribution the noise g is drawn from.<p>But this is mainly just something that can be determined by studying the process.

",,"What are some of the ways that you coded yourself out of a real-life problem?<p>For me, I wanted to go to Momofuku Ko, except they have an annoying .NET reservation system for their coveted 12 seats and 2 seatings, which you can only book 6 days in advance for 24 seats. You have seconds to enter your credit card number to confirm.<p>But it is a good restaurant, and reservations disappear fast; all are gone by 10:00 AM ET. So like any self-respecting hacker, I got TextMate and Ruby out, performed some sudo gem install mechanize magic, did some serious Regex/XQuery work, wrote a function to perform exponential smoothing on calculating the time difference from my clock to the Momofuku clock, and slept soundly at 7 AM Arizona time, knowing that my reservation would be booked (it's unfair I have to get up at 6:55 AM to check if my resy went through, just because I live in a state like Arizona where food is bad except for Pizzeria Bianco and some others!)<p>Hope to hear some great things from you guys!<p>Cheers,

Sequential partitioning (saying say, users a-l go on Partition 1 and m-z go on #2) gives you certain capabilities for range queries but also risks you overloading if one particular user is significantly larger than others.<p>Cassandra recommends random partitioning as a way of better balancing your data across shards.<p>You're going to run into the same problem on just about any sharded setup (With any software) - how do you make sure that you are distributing new chunks/documents/rows in a way that doesn't overload any given server.",1286492191

The patents are not for an API, they're for things like sandboxing, preprocessors etc. You can see them all here: <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/38768100/Oracle-v-Google-Complaint"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/38768100/Oracle-v-Google-Complaint</a><p>Should such things be patentable, maybe not but the fact is that they are at present. In the US, if I patent something and you come up with your own invention which does the same thing, I can say you're infringing. It doesn't matter whether you were even aware of my invention (except for the purpose of awarding damages); the patent is granted for the purpose which is fulfilled rather more than the mechanism used. On the upside, patents last 20 years and after than anyone can clone your idea (sooner in some cases).<p>Claims about the API etc are copyright claims, which here include source code, but also specifications and documentation and so on. The basic argument from Oracle's side is that Sun owned Java, but granted people the freedom to do whatever they liked with it <i>up to a point</i>. Go past that point, and you've broken the agreement and the grant of rights is revoked.<p>But there was no agreement, you might say - however, there usually is. You have to acknowledge one to download the JDK, and you're agreeing to the terms therein. The reason Google is making such strenuous effort to point out that Dalvik != Java is because Java is not actually so open that they could just port it. Building their own compiler and VM gets them off a particular contractual hook in the licensing terms, but the problem is that going to such lengths to comply with a single provision in the license creates an implicit acceptance of the license as a whole, and (like most contracts) said license also includes a provision that if one part fails when its legality challenged, all the other parts still remain in force.",1286491813

Any seasoned startup junkie will tell you that outsourcing early product development is a surefire pathway to failure.

And .ly is one of the riskiest, because it's run by an anti-western, anti-US dictatorship. You may think that because the regime currently supports the continued existence of a particular web business today that they will forever, but the history of such regimes argues that there is a lot of risk in that assumption. The regime may change its mind based on arbitrary criteria. It may decide that bit.ly is no longer in its favors. It may decide to nationalize bit.ly, redirecting the domain to a Libyan owned copy of bit.ly, prepopulated with existing shortened urls gathered from searches. Or, the country may undergo a change of regime. What happens when (not if) Gaddaffi dies (he is already nearly 70)? What happens if the country undergoes another coup? What happens if the country renames itself and gets rid of the old TLD?<p>This use/misuse of ccTLDs for commercial purposes (e.g. .tv, .ly, .it, .co, .to, etc.) is a relatively recent practice, there hasn't been enough time to decide if it's a safe practice or not.

I know a lot of designers, and they know how to make things pretty, but they are not what I am looking for. What I want is specifically designers with experience designing user interfaces. That is, people who can design software (its visual interface), rather than design a website (or a print publication).<p>And also, I need to find them in my area.<p>There are sites like http://dribbble.com/ that allow me to find good designers. However, this  is a mix of designers who are good at all different kinds of things, not just UI design. And I do not thing I can sort by them by region or zip code.<p>UI design tends to be the kind of thing where face-to-face communication among developers and clients is important. In the Agile Manifesto http://agilemanifesto.org/  it says ""The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."" I find this to be most true when figuring out the interface.<p>When I was in Florida, my clients asked my recommendation for good UI designers. But I did not know any good UI designers in Florida. When I was in Virginia, my clients asked my recommendation for good UI designers, but I only knew one who was truly good and he was more than fully employed.

Ignoring (external) factors like pesticides, etc., pollination activities subject them to intense pressures (monoculture, hive movement, sick bees from remote geographies, etc.).  Varroa, for example, is pretty much endemic in hives throughout the US after having been ""introduced"" in the late 80s.<p>The University of Minnesota, known for the Minnesota Hygienic line, instructs fledgling beekeepers to follow a ""two-year"" plan.  The first year involves lots of chemical treatments (routine use of ""nasty"" chemicals is now the norm in the hive), the second year more chemicals and (hopefully) lots of honey.  After two years?  Kill the hive.<p>The end-game in all of this seems unsustainable (highly-evolved diseases and highly-chemical-dependent hives).  I've been trying to work out a better plan for myself:  one that does not tolerate chemical treatments (but is willing to let weak hives die), works with the bees, and fosters reproduction of thriving stock.  I'd appreciate any resources you'd be able to share to aid in this.",1286488892

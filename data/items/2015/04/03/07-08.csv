Some important data models that fit in these architectures operate on data types that are not meaningfully order-able at a mathematical level i.e. you can&#x27;t sort them.

We moved most of our work to Haskell&#x27;s Yesod framework, which has years of community work and incredible craftsmanship behind it.</i><p>And then Haskell&#x27;s Yesod gets abandoned when the core devs move to shinier things and nobody else is bothered, like several Clojure web frameworks that were touted back in the day...<p>And you realise that maybe updating your own framework when and were you needed it, was not that big of a deal actually....",1428044536

The best people with &quot;software architect&quot; in their title that I have worked with have focused on total system quality through striving towards simplicity mainly by focusing on development <i>and</i> tooling <i>and</i> using their position as the arbiter of technical decisions to guide the system under development to coherent whole that fullfills the business requirements in a technically sound way.<p>The most complex design tool outside of an IDE I&#x27;ve seen these guys use is plaintext and simple diagrams. They grok the thing that is being built in their heads from the CPU caches to the end-user abstraction.<p>The most horrible architects I&#x27;ve observed deliver UML:s, search for the most complex technical thing their mind can think of to solve a problem and then after saving the UML to disk think their job is &quot;done&quot; and hand-wave through the rest of the development pointing to the UML boxes.<p>The mediocre architects are a mix of these two.<p>An architect who is not participating in hands-on coding is a serious red-flag about the quality of the development organization in most instances to me. I&#x27;m sure there are counter-examples :)",1428044527

9314692,comment,9313499,9313499,0,0,umbs,,,"Myself: \nI meditate at least once a day, for about 15 mins. I tried few guided meditations and then learnt a technique that requires no external guidance/input. Along with breathing techniques and a bit of Yoga, I found the combination to be deeply relaxing and energizing.<p>Few times a year, I volunteer in high schools and teach these techniques (Yoga, breathing and meditation) to teenagers. It&#x27;s mostly in schools that are low income and a bit rough neighborhoods. I have personally seen kids get a lot out of meditation.<p>Method: \nThere are many meditation methods (mindfulness being one). The one that I practice loosely follows these principles: \n1) The art of not _doing_ anything is meditation. There is no control over which thought enters our mind. But we can choose not to chase those thoughts. Catch ourselves if we do and drop it.\n2) There is continuous input to the mind (through senses) throughout the day. This has happened, may be, since we were a kid. Meditation is giving rest to all these senses. That in itself saves lot of energy. Initially, it not easy. Hence, a guided meditation helps. But after some practice, one can learn a technique.<p>Benefits: \n1) Meditation is deeply relaxing experience. After a long day and tiring day, 10-15 mins of meditation makes me fresh and ready for next set of tasks. \n2) Minor health niggles (headaches, body pains etc) have all reduced or gone after 15 mins meditation. When body gets deep rest, it has capacity to recover/heal.<p>Time/Location: \n- I did meditation in airport lounge, in my car (parked), city bus and almost all places where I can sit upright.<p>Resources:\n- If you live in SF Bay Area, I recommend this: <a href=""http://calmeditates.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calmeditates.org/</a>\n- Try this app. My friends highly recommend it: <a href=""http://www.sattva.life/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sattva.life/</a>",1428044503

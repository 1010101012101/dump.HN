Nazis killed six million Jews -- an evil much worse than slavery -- well within the lifetime of people alive. All sorts of people having been doing all sorts of mean things to other people well within the lifetime of people alive.<p>I'm in my 40s, which means that I never knew a society that wouldn't allow blacks to vote. I certainly had nothing to do with slavery. I used to find this identity politics justified, then amusing (as I thought through it some more), and now it's just feeble.<p>There are two kinds of people in the world: those that start each day looking for opportunities and those that start each day looking to the past. I'd rather be the second kind of person. So I don't discriminate based on color, won't put up with others who do, and am finished with considering race an interesting or important issue.<p>As an aside, there's a serious issue with segregating population based on skin color (as opposed to any other random collection of genes)for purposes of commentary -- it actually reinforces the idea that somehow people of one color are different than another. Of course we all know that patterns appear in the genetic pool, but using skin color as a predominant discriminating factor is, as best, misguided. At worst, it can cause the exact types of behavior we all agree is so bad.",1248562787

The music industry (at least the Popular Music Industry) started putting out more and more formulaic garbage, b/c it was low risk.  The AP stopped doing journalism and moved to a press-release transcription agency.  Eventually both started dying.  They started looking around for <i>external</i> causes, and found The Internet.<p>Now they're trying to undo the effects of internet in hopes that they'll return to where they were before.  Of course, what they have to do is realize that where they were before was due to their risk-taking predecessors' legacies, and where they are now are the results of their own cowardly actions.<p>What they should do is fire themselves and admit that they're cowardly losers.",1248562737

723780,comment,723486,723740,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I've never heard of this occuring at a primitive level (which was what I was referring to).  I know there are primates where females are considered the ""leaders"" such as Gibbons and monogamy has been observed in them but I've never seen a male dominated society of primates where monogamy was naturally occuring.<p>Again, I'm not disputing the fact that men can want to be monogomous or realize it's the best way to breed.  I'll even concede it occurs in non-primates such as birds.  But I don't see any examples where a primate male's nature is to be monogamous without female influence.<p>Edit: You know, I'm thinking on this and it doesn't even make sense.  Lets say its true and we have dual evolutionary natures one of which is to seek out means to create a paticular type of offspring.  How is that contradictory to polygamy?  Couldn't you hunt down every female in your area with those desired traits?  More to the point wouldn't it be smart to do just that in order to increase your chances of generating that preferred off spring (assuming primates didn't have in depth knowledge of genetics and passive traits)?",1248561576

But the majoirty opinion among people who study male nature is that our instinct is to ""spread our seed"" as widely as possible because or evolutionary purpose is to further our own lineage.<p>You see this in pretty much all primates.  Silverback Gorilla's have whole tribes that are made up of the women they have sex with and their children.  Because even in modern primates the males nature is to breed with as many women as possible.<p>Also, I said nothing about male and female roles in society.  My entire argument is based around male and female instincts and I've said there are exceptions (again look above where I say feminism exists because there are exceptions and it's a good thing)",1248561236

There was a slight hope for the automatic translation of documents [i.e. scientific papers] from one language to another, and funding was abundant with the '56 landmark paper. The original goal then was not reached, but as with all good research, the by-products were of great value.

What has shifted in African American customs, in our community, in our consciousness, that has made marriage seem unnecessary or unattainable?""<p>Well, for one thing: Welfare.  Welfare was created at a time when most poor, single moms were ""the deserving poor"" -- ie widowed -- and having a child out of wedlock was a big taboo and hardly done.  Welfare, while well-meaning, was (unfortunately) designed in a manner that rewards women for becoming poor, single moms -- and thus actively grew the population that fits this profile by changing the social contract.  Although (iirc) most people on welfare are white, the small amount of money involved in getting food stamps and welfare is more alluring to people who are very poor and live in neighborhoods where the mentality is one of hopelessness, with no expectation that one can get ahead honestly.  Add in the fact that blacks are ""last hired, first fired"" and the tendency for young black males to be the biggest victim of that reality, and you have a situation ripe for developing a culture where a woman has a baby by one man, gets on welfare, breaks up with him and then finds a different boyfriend -- in part because a father is expected to provide for his kids (and gets booted out the door when he cannot) but mom's new boyfriend is seen as generous for doing anything for the kids, even if he doesn't actually provide for them.  ""Gifts"" are enough.<p>There are some books, articles and studies about such things.  I've read a fair amount of stuff like that over the years.<p>On the upside, I've seen some stuff that indicates that black  women tend to have more say in how the money is spent when they are part of a couple than white women do.  The paychecks of black women are more needed for a black couple to make it at all.  The paycheck of a married white woman who has kids is more likely to be seen as ""fun money"" -- something the family can spend on vacations and other extras but not really needed for basic necessities -- and this tends to carry with it less ""voting"" power when financial decisions are made.",1248559837

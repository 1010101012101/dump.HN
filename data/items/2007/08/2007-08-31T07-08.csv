48639,comment,48129,48129,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am not entirely convinced by the arguments yet. Maybe it really makes more sense to donate to individuals? I think what we like to see is our donations have an effect. It is easier to imagine that one child could be helped, than that 8 children could be helped. Looking at a whole country full of squalor, one simply doesn't feel as if one could make a difference. I mean it is not that we feel less sorry about the mass of suffering people, only less confident in out ability to help. <p>OK, so that would still be a problem of perception. On the other hand, I am also not sure that I accept the other premise of the article, that throwing lots of money at a problem is going to make it go away. It is great what Bill Gates is doing, but it has not yet proven that it will work, or has it? ",1188546673

- Solo entrepreneurs seldom succeed, 2 are more likely to succeed, 3 are even more likely, 4 are even more likely, and 5 are even more likely (don't have enough data after 5)</i><p>I think the main factor behind this is not work division, but social stimulation.  Just being around other people is stimulating.  Plus, we are wired to assign importance to what other people are doing; if nobody else is doing it, it doesn't <i>seem</i> important.  By contrast, look how hard two friends will compete to outdo each other in meaningless contests of trivia, gross-outs, and even hazardous stunts.<p>",1188545927

48628,comment,48284,48618,0,0,ed,,,"Ok, to counter my bummer parent post here are some things you COULD feasibly implement in javascript:<p>- color tinting (overlay semi-transparent colored elements on an image)<p>- image cut-and-paste (like cropping, place some bounded area of an image in a div with hidden overflow [the copy] and allow that to then be placed over the original image [the paste])<p>- image gradients, drop shadows, reflections (but these have been done to death and are usually too sluggish to use in a production app)<p>- some neat UI tricks like scroll wheel zooming and gesture-based panning (mootools has some demos which show what's possible - demos.mootools.net)<p>- if you really wanted to kill yourself, you could use flash (degrade to a server-side script) to build a pixel by pixel representation of the image using floated divs and background colors. Then create a JS singleton with your desired methods to be the image buffer's API. Thus, you're granted pixel-level access to the image and could (slowly) do whatever sort of processing you desire in JS.",1188545090

You just can't get a complete picture without examining the failures, too.<p>It's probably better to be optimistic, because being realistic is likely to simply be depressing, but still, for those curious about the system as a whole, you can't just look at success.",1188544686
48625,comment,48387,48387,0,0,trekker7,,,"I always wondered why ""Web apps"" have to be made with HTML and accessed through a URL. Web apps are basically regular applications with a shared user database. If you have a graphics intensive application, instead of using AJAX, why not use mature client-side graphics facilities and release a downloadable program that talks to a remote shared database for Web 2.0 style functionality? The only downside is that software updates are harder to propagate, but with update alerts this is not so much of an issue.",1188544680

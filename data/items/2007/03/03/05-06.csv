1945,comment,1890,1890,0,0,bootload,,,"Releasing new software products to a market and being successful may seem to be timing, luck or good marketing?  But the pro's know better and know there is more to it than that. The answer to your question is not as cut and dry as you think.<p>ASSUMPTION?: I'm assuming your product is a shrink wrapped binary to be released to one operating system for single users (from what I've read on your product).<p>COMMUNICATION: I cannot really view your software, but it looks like its a binary application. Unlike its web counterparts, your audience cannot simply use your software. This is by far the biggest hurdle. If your audience cannot use or see your software they will judge (rightly or wrongly) by what information you offer. Do you show on your website, blog or other forms of communication the following?<p>* product summary?: simple sentence explaining problem solved<p>* why better/product comparison: how is your product than competitor(s)?<p>* features: list of things the software does<p>* scenario: small stories of how certain problems are solved<p>* images: screenshots of major forms<p>* blog: meta behind the scene view of product (my favourite as you can really \nguage the product process) & how real users solve their problems (hopefully with your software)?<p>* forums: what problems people are having<p>* price: what is the price of your software? No price, even if its alpha still give a hint <p>DELIVERY: Are you going to have your software on your website? Or are you going to look for the best couple of sites that offer downloads for new & categorised binary software like Tucows or Cnet.com? The ranking and categorising of products make it easier for users to find new & interesting software and also makes it easier for developers to find their markets. From here you can work out important things like pricing, feature matching etc.<p>  '... Your first set of problems revolve more around business & distribution than software and engineering. ...'<p>CONCLUSION: Notice I've not added any development problems here (release planning, defect processes, etc ...)  Your first set of problems revolve more around business & distribution than software and engineering.  Since you have invested time & money and you want to protect your investment consider the following. Go back to marketing 101. <p>Invest the time (not money) to see how you can improve the communication of your product on your site. Then concentrate on placing your product with Cnet. At the same time maintain your job (and income) & improve the existing code but not new features.<p>There are other alternatives, explore those. I do not suggest you open source the product. If you have created a site that communicates the benefits of the product. Found a way to deliver the product to consumers. Then you can work on selling.  This is going to take longer than you probably think.  ",1172900428

The only time that would make sense if there is a very small finite market for your product- for example- if there are only 50 people on the planet who will pay for your product and there's a reasonable chance they'll know where to find it, then yah, don't give it away.  When is that ever true, though?  When you sell nuclear submarine technology to 1st world governments?  It sounds like you've put a lot of sweat and guts into this.  I would suggest you read http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php (it applies even if yours isn't a web app) and Crossing the Chasm http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060517123 which goes into the mechanics of your market.  If you took down the demo because it made your product look bad because it was incomplete, complete a smaller subset.  If you took it down because someone said someone would steal your idea, welcome to startups- know that they'll steal it and move on and do it better.",1172899638

This is an interesting analysis she published a while back (though it's ever evolving), especially since most people are quick to generalize Friendster's demise as a product of internal politics and featuritis.",1172898220
1940,comment,1890,1890,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Websites tend to grow exponentially, meaning that for the first few months mainly the earlier adopter types will be the ones playing with it. Does your website currently do anything that creates value for them? If so, release even if it's buggy and unfinished. People will expect it to improve. On the other hand, if people go there and see that it doesn't solve their problems or make their life easier, they probably won't go back a second time. So if it doesn't yet solve a problem, wait until it does this.",1172898191

But I would feel comfortable charging only on a finished product.\nGiving away a Viewer makes sense only when I have a multimedia customer. For example, if Paul Graham wants to 'broadcast' his audio talks.\nThat is an interesting thought - can I get this in front of Paul Graham right now? :)",1172898059

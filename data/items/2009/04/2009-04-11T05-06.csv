It's just a ton of money to tempt people with, relatively speaking.<p>Putting it all in comparison with a table of purchasing power parity ( ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita ) is revealing.<p>The average Somali income is apparently 600$ per year.  So an average 2 million $ ransom is 3,333 times the average yearly income.  Using the same chart, 3,333 times the US number (47,500) is 158.3 million $.<p>According to the article below, a low level pirate makes 10,000 a year, which puts him 17 times above average.  Using the same US comparison this gives him an income of 807,500.<p>Edit:

It is more of a mutual relationship -- IBM needed to take on Microsoft, and Linux was the easiest way to do that.  So, IBM gives the open source developer time, money, and their patent portfolio, and IBM can compete better with Microsoft.<p>The Thinkpads are also mighty fine computers.

557274,comment,556908,557251,0,0,erlanger,,,"<i>""PG said: 10,000 people is a drop in the bucket by immigration standards""</i><p>Yes, in terms of people. But you fail to understand that it's <i>an entire new process and system</i> that would have to be invented and executed.<p>You just don't think like a con-man. Universities have quite a bit on the line, such as accreditation. A private company has next to nothing on the line. Anyway, here's how I'd do it:<p>1. First off, I'd need to know somebody in the US who has a viable business and would vouch for me. Because immigrant communities support business focused on their interests, this wouldn't be very difficult. Of course they'd agree, because of the benefits for the home country (sending money home, etc.).<p>2. Have them offer fake investments to me and a pool of founders. Get approved by INS/State.<p>3. Once in the US, work as I please. Funnel this money back into the ""startup"" as profits. Plenty of startups can't even turn a profit, so financials wouldn't have to be impressive.<p>4. Rinse, repeat. The same business would only get approved so many times, but there are <i>tons</i> of businesses here.<p>Now, for the unscrupulous way (since there's nothing particularly immoral about the previous scenario). Note that I'm for the legalization of drugs, but that's not the point: The US gov't is sure as hell against that.<p>1. Have associate(s) in the US prop up a shell of a business that appears to be legitimate. Have them offer a huge investment for what appears to be a startup's credible business plan.<p>2. Move in under an alias with fake documents.<p>3. Funnel drug money through the ""startup,"" which would be an ideal money laundering node. Because the plan is intended to produce successful businesses, nobody would blink an eye at the eye-popping profits. Just bullshit as much as necessary...if YouTube cooked the books, they could convince people that they were turning $150M profit annually easily. Show your cards as you please, since you're holding the deck.<p>4. If things get even remotely hot, leave the country. So much money's been successfully processed at this point that it's undoubtedly a net win. Hell, say you're flying to Lima to make a commencement speech on business. Nobody would stop you. The associates could claim ignorance obviously, as you were just some entrepreneur they put their hopes and dollars in. Even if the startup were irrevocably linked to money laundering, you're back home and extradition isn't happening, since you used a false identity.<p>5. Rinse, repeat with other associates.<p><i>""Give one shred of evidence aside from senseless pontification and I might consider it.""</i><p>Evidence on a virgin immigration plan? I'm sure there's plenty out there!<p>Let's flip this: Tell me how you prevent either of the two previous scenarious, short of having the gov't handle the entire recommendation/approval process, which would pretty much defeat the purpose.<p><i>Sigh</i> ... people are so naive.",1239428966

557269,comment,557007,557007,0,0,jballanc,,,"The better question would be: If CS were taught in as many classes as English in K-12, what would 12th grade <i>English</i> look like?<p>To address the question posed, though, I would posit that 12th grade CS would not benefit substantially. Very advanced CS relies on topics from math and other areas which can only be developed gradually. There's no point in teaching efficient algorithms for Newton's Method or Runge-Kutta to a student who hasn't even had entry level calculus.<p>I would advocate more teaching of CS in elementary education not for the virtues of CS, but for the structure it brings to much else that is taught at that level. Teaching principles of logic in English or Science, and then putting those principles into practice with a simple program would help to reinforce what's already being taught.",1239428481

On top of that, it's nearly impossible to anticipate how details need to be described to get through to any one individual.

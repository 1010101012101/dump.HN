But what really gets to me, as a newbie developer, is the interview and hiring commentary. It makes me feel like there's just no hope for somebody like me-- I don't have a CS degree and come from the world of humanities and liberal arts. The furthest I went with math in Uni was Discrete. I don't take tests well, and I'm no good with heavy duty algorithmic methodology (though I do know some of them). I don't have any formulae memorized. I tend to think of programming like I do writing: I have great grammar, punctuation, and spelling.<p>I'm afraid I would fail miserably at these gauntlet-style tests applied by big SV companies. I love technology and I love building things and what I'm doing now, but the path of achievement and improvement professionally from novice to indispensible pro often seems cloudy to me. I think our culture needs to spend more time and money on apprenticeship and helping less experienced developers reach that next rung on the ladder.

Santorum chocolate box thing last night being the latest), with its millions and millions of viewers, to say nothing of all the other publicity that this gag has gotten, I think it's reasonable to say that this ""gag"" -- the collective redefinition of the word Santorum in response to perceived bigotry -- is actually a bigger deal than Rick Santorum the (fringey, extreme, minor) Republican politician.<p>That would likely change if Santorum actually began to be a <i>plausible</i> contender for the presidential nomination, but that's extremely unlikely.<p>I think the maximum response from Google appropriate to this issue would be one of those explanatory disclaimers in the sidebar, like they put next to the photoshopped gorilla photo results when you image-searched for Michelle Obama.",1325732169
3427128,comment,3425942,3425942,3,0,prophetjohn,,,"I have to seriously doubt this. Being good at programming requires a very similar type of brain as the one required to be good at mathematics. The argument is often ""if only programming were to become standard curriculum which everyone is required to learn in some capacity, more people would be programming-literate.""<p>Mathematics, in some level, has been required at all levels of education for quite some time and yet very few people can become proficient at anything at the college algebra level or above. If programming were to become as commonplace in our education system as math is, I believe you would see much the same thing. Many people would be able to memorize enough rules to get through the basics, but once it comes time to show that these basic concepts are understood in the form of applying them to more advanced concepts, you're going to see more people failing to get by, just as you do in anything other than basic math classes.<p>I certainly couldn't imagine a career becoming mainstream that requires mid-level calculus, or even algebra, and certainly not advanced analysis and proofing. By the same token, I find it hard to believe that any profession that requires understanding more than basic computer science concepts (simple looping and conditionals, no OO) will become mainstream. However programming today (writing a Rails app) is significantly different than it was 10 years ago (writing massive programs in C/assembly), so it's possible that programming becomes much easier than it currently is.",1325732168

Firing is about as simple & cheap as it gets outside of an Indonesian sweatshop. Many start as contractors anyway. The upside should have been that companies would be quicker to hire. Instead sprung a weird culture of ""the four hour interview"" (sometimes several of these).<p>There's actually not that much you can find out about someone before hiring them: ""Show me a piece of code you've written"" - hopefully it's on GitHub or similar, ideally forked by some other people too - ""Tell me about some design decisions you made when building this"". You should also try to gauge personality, motivation, curiosity and chemistry.<p>That's about all you'll know, regardless of how convoluted your process. But fortunately you're not in France, so if it doesn't work out you can always go your separate ways.<p>When companies take too long to hire it usually indicates fear of making decisions.

One of the cardinal rules of being a truly great salesperson is to believe in what you're selling (Zig Ziglar talks about this often). If you don't, customers and prospects will not only be able to smell it from a mile away, but your passion and desire to succeed will be nonexistent and you'll have to fight for every closed deal because you won't have anything convincing to say when the person on the other end decides to call you on your bullshit. Being a truly great salesperson means fundamentally understanding the needs of the customer and working together to discover ways that your product or service can deliver them benefit and a positive ROI. Sales is about asking questions and listening intently, and I believe the truly great people find a way to effectively sit on the same side of the table as the customer while at the same time delivering the objectives that their company requires. Honesty and integrity play a huge role in selling and business relationships, and any company that understands the value of maintaining long-term business relationships will work this into their sales incentive structure.",1325730828

The government will then shut down the pawn shop without even talking to the owner first or having significant proof that the item was really stolen.

The pawn shop can then attempt to get their store back from the government but if it turns out that the item really was stolen then the government will not return it.""

Julian Togelius and Georgios Yannakakis are some of the big names looking at this topic right now.<p>One approach is to use tried-and-true statistical techniques to build models from user feedback. Often a player will be provided two variations of a game and asked which one was more fun. This input, combined with various other factors (how did the player perform? how many enemies were there in each version?) help construct some sort of classifier to automatically evaluate new game variations.<p>An alternate approach, which I explored during my Master's research on the topic, was to analyze existing levels in commercially released videogames to construct a model of fun from that, as opposed to considering subjective human feedback. I chose to analyse Super Mario Brothers. It turns out you can see a very characteristic pattern in how the difficult portions of the levels are arranged. This pattern of difficulty takes the form of a rhythmic interplay of difficult and easier portions, and can be nicely described in terms of Flow and the Yerkes-Dodson law. We used this a criterion for evaluating automatically generated levels as a part of a larger system.<p>The applications of this are pretty wide. Perhaps we could automatically evaluate web page interactions according to a certain model of fun to engage users? Perhaps we can detect when people are not having fun and automatically generate alternate designs?",1325729440

Benchmarking the speed of a true append is difficult because in order to preserve the original string in the benchmark you must dup it anyhow (done here outside of the bench.report block). However, the bigger the strings get, the more pronounced the advantage of appending is.<p><pre><code>                user     system      total        real\n  add  2      0.260000   0.000000   0.260000 (  0.263414)\n  join 2      0.320000   0.000000   0.320000 (  0.325341)\n  append 2    0.230000   0.010000   0.240000 (  0.235669)\n\n  add  3      0.500000   0.000000   0.500000 (  0.497219)\n  join 3      0.840000   0.020000   0.860000 (  0.866401)\n  append 3    0.260000   0.010000   0.270000 (  0.268676)\n\n  add  4      0.360000   0.040000   0.400000 (  0.397778)\n  join 4      0.970000   0.030000   1.000000 (  0.997321)\n  append 4    0.280000   0.000000   0.280000 (  0.281020)\n\n  add  5      0.460000   0.000000   0.460000 (  0.454780)\n  join 5      0.910000   0.030000   0.940000 (  0.946600)\n  append 5    0.330000   0.000000   0.330000 (  0.336214)\n</code></pre>\nCode: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1563290"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1563290</a>",1325728894

What you want when you search the internet is a relevant result, regardless of its pagerank.\nIf the system relies too much in the pagerank to determine whether a site is relevant to your search terms or not, well, yes, the system is broken.",1325728887

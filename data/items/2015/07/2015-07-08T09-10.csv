Sure, smokers know that cigarettes are harmful and that their live is probably going to be shortened by smoking, but they do not know the rates or severity of the various health problems.<p>For example Most men do not know that smoking is a leading cause of male impotence. People don&#x27;t understand why their surgeon wants them to stop smoking (reduced risks during surgery; better healing after).",1436349572

They are way more energy-efficient, and way smarter in the survivalist sense, than any of them.<p>If ants decide to exterminate us, there&#x27;s nothing much we can do. Except they wouldn&#x27;t succeed.<p>But you probably think that we, humans, are much smarter than ants (which is arguable). Yet again, if we decided to exterminate ants, there&#x27;s nothing much they can do, but we wouldn&#x27;t succeed.<p>They&#x27;re too smart for us, and we&#x27;re too smart for them, creating a situation where annihilation of either is impractical.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why people consider inorganic intelligence differently from the way they consider organic intelligence.

There likely is greater inefficiency, I agree. But &#x27;public sector jobs = unneeded jobs&#x27; is wrong. Second, cutting those jobs is often impossible (for example in Germany it would be, because government jobs are guaranteed for a lifetime.) and even if they can be cut, they will drive up unemployment which already stands at 25% and 60% for young people.<p>> i have read nowhere that syriza wants to tax the rich greeks that pay virtually to really no taxes (reeders for example)<p>They do [1].

I reduced my dose gradually over two weeks. There were no physical withdrawal symptoms, and only minor craving which went away after a few months abstinence.

His thesis is that having to trade your time for money is wrong.<p>If what you&#x27;ve said above is what you took away from the linked writing, I think you&#x27;re projecting your own beliefs onto the author position, and we should stop this argument because I&#x27;m not against changing our relation with work.

Reducing economic productivity reduces, eliminates or reverses those improvements.<p>> This does not devalue the proposition - it merely puts it into context.<p>Given that the author&#x27;s proposition is to dismantle a system that for millennia bore specialists who make possible technological advance, and replace it with a system that rears general hobbyists, yes I believe it does devalue the proposition.<p>> You&#x27;re doing that thing again.

You say 2bb people don&#x27;t have plumbing, then say you don&#x27;t think we shouldn&#x27;t have plumbing, then go onto something else. Or is your alternative that we should all have pit toilets?<p>We should be discussing the broken alternative proposition of the author, but: those 2 billion folks that don&#x27;t have sanitation and plumbing would likely choose sanitation and plumbing if they could. They obviously live in areas where pit toilets and outhouses aren&#x27;t enough to deal with the human waste they produce, or they&#x27;d just be digging latrines and outhouses and using those.<p>So, if your position is that we can get by without professional sanitation and pluming industries, they would seem to be the counterpoint.<p>Fundamentally, do you really agree we&#x27;ll get more scientists, engineers, professional specialists, innovating and advancing our society and the same or greater pace, if everyone just stops working and &quot;pursues their passions&quot;?",1436347370

Something that helped a lot was figuring out how 3D graphics work first. Specifically vertices, faces, and meshes, then coordinate systems, vectors, and transforms, then lighting and cameras, and lastly textures and UV coordinates. I did that using three.js to display things in a browser with a bit of javascript. Once I&#x27;d figured that out and had a much better understanding of what 3D engines actually do I found it a lot easier to work out how Blender lets you control those things in it&#x27;s interface.",1436346321

Were it not possible to park $x billion in account and draw $y million a year in interest for literally forever, many such institutions could not exist.<p>They used to own land (and peasants!) themselves or they were funded by someone who did (Church/King/Prince).  The former was preferred due to the larger independence and stability it gave them.<p>Copenhagen University used to own lots of land, for example.  So did (do) Oxford and Cambridge.",1436346273

If you want to wake up at 8 am, your last meal of the day should be at 6 pm (<i>14 hours before that</i>).<p>This works so well, that it overrides the effects of alcohol and caffeine and often even how tired you are.  Even if you usually stay up until 3 am you&#x27;ll get very sleepy at midnight and you&#x27;ll wake up at 8. If fact even if you are prevented from sleeping until 3, you&#x27;ll still wake up at 8 after just 5 hours of sleep. Have a full breakfast to avoid sleeping during the day - the next day you&#x27;ll probably get sleepy at midnight again, even if you have dinner a bit later than 6.<p>Why does this work? Your &#x27;food clock&#x27; will override all the other timers that govern your sleep habits. I cannot find the sources for this, but there are pretty good biological reasons this works. I know that I have used this rule many times for my benefit when working shift work or travelling or even getting back in rhythm after a vacation.<p>Edit:

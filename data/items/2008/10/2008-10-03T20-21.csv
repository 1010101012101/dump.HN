Definitely worth reading if you consider trying something on AppEngine so you can know ahead of time what some of the less documented limitations are.<p>Some of the things the article mentions that I never realized: 1MB limit on python variables, 1000 limit on offset (which together with the 1000 limit on results means you can only ever fetch 2000 items).",1223067356

It's an interesting development and people are tackling it from a number of angles.<p>It seems your approach is more descriptive than numerical. That could be good, a lot of the recent players are more numbers oriented which may turn off most users.<p>For a good summary of the field, Google ""Me-trics"", who presented at TC50. You'll find a lot of the competitors listed on various posts discussing Me-trics. I think the personal analytics/crowd-sourced-research-experiment space is set for solid growth in the coming years.<p>I've tried a number of different UI's and a number of different techniques to mining the data.

He said that not buying at market value and instead giving the banks whatever they ask for these assets will likely lead to a wasted 700b.

Additionally, raising the limit on FDIC insurance will make it harder to determine when a bank is in trouble.  Now I am not naive, I am sure that was the idea behind raising the limit in the first place.

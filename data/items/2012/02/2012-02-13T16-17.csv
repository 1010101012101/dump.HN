Not to mention that I'm sure there was a lot of work involved in deciding these things on a case-by-case basis.<p>Personally, I'd be much more comfortable with the situation if Reddit had decided early on to place a blanket ban on these types of sub-reddits under this justification, rather than waiting until the PR shitstorm started up, but even if it is just a face-saving move at this point, I think the logic is pretty sound.

3586207,comment,3584104,3584993,5,0,geebee,,,"This is indisputably a big part of why people on wall street get paid so much.  It doesn't explain why the opportunity exists in the first place, but it does explain why the top players get so much money.<p>As long as we're careful not to associate ""bringing in revenue"" with ""creating wealth"", I'm in agreement.  My big problem with wall street isn't that top players get money - that's fine by me.  It's that they acquire wealth without creating it, and in many cases inflict real wealth destruction on the rest of the economy.<p>In general, I'd say that in a a good economic system, wealth acquisition correlates closely and positively with wealth creation. When it does, people tend to value and admire the wealthy.  When the correlation becomes negative, well, you get the French revolution.<p>This is a big part of why wall street pr types try to frame this as a general ""anger with the 1% issue"" rather than as an ""anger with wall street"" issue (and even then, plenty of banking activity is highly beneficial to the economy).  This is why I was so disappointed to see the ""occupy wall street"" movement become so diluted (""occupy the ports!  occupy berkeley!).  In the early days, we could turn to the wall street people and say ""hey, this is occupy wall street, not occupy google.  we aren't you, don't think you get to hide behind a productive industry that actually creates some value.""

3586183,comment,3584609,3585909,6,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Your argument basically calls for casual users to stop being casual and to begin to become experts. Activity monitor certainly does help casual users understand what's going on. For the casual user using a system normally (meaning having a browser open, checking mail, writing in a word processor) seeing that application X is using the most memory means that's the problem to them and they're correct to assume they should kill it. It may be hit or miss but that's all they know and in most cases things get fixed that way.<p>As professionals we often forget what it is to be a casual user. Asking a casual user to learn what you explained as folklore is simply too much to ask. Everyone who uses a computer should at least be technically literate to a degree but that means understanding the basics. To a casual user the basics are: my computer has a processor that executes tasks, it has RAM that stores data for quick retrieval, and a hard disk for long term storage. Each application uses a percentage of my finite RAM and when it runs out my system slows down. Therefore logic dictates that if I kill the app taking the up the most RAM my computer will go faster.<p>That's all they usually know. We understand that Activity Monitor lies to us and killing random processes is voodoo but we also have to take into account how we use our machines. The casual user will be able to solve their problem by killing processes more often than people like us will because of the way they use their systems plus there is a placebo effect for them. When they kill a process they often <i>feel</i> like the system just got faster regardless of whether it really did.<p>I liken it to driving a car. Ask some random person about fuel economy. Their thinking is ""high octane fuel has more energy per gallon therefore if I use it I'll get better fuel economy"". They might even know the relationship between tire inflation and fuel economy too if you're lucky. Ask a professional driver about those things and they'll look down at the average person like they're crazy. They know all how octane, oil, air filtration, shocks, struts, aerodynamics, etc, etc. all contribute to better fuel economy. ""If only the average driver knew what I knew, then they'd save a ton on gas"" theyd think. But alas, that's too much to expect so we just have to make sure they get the basics and it's up to the professionals to provide the average person with something that just works and do our best to be one step ahead of users by anticipating their usage patterns. This applies to hardware/software engineering, car manufacturing, and anything else. You just can't expect the user to learn or even take an interest in even a quarter of what we know.",1329150980

The App Store has embraced digital distribution.  Purchasing and downloading apps could not be easier.  It's certainly easier than pirating them.  And yet app store piracy is a huGe problem [1].<p>Why?  Because if you pirate, you have money left over for other things.  It's that simple.  So even though you could afford $2 for an app, you'd rather pirate the app and spend the $2 on something else.  It's human nature.  This is one reason societies make laws and enforce them with police.

I opened up Activity Monitor, went to a new tab, and noticed that my disk activity had spiked. I figured that the memory system was swapping in/out a lot of pages, so I looked at rough memory usage, and saw that the Shockwave Flash plugin had close to 1 GB in RSS.

I killed the tab, and I had no more problems.<p>Blunt tools can still be useful. The problem isn't the tool, it's the knowledge that people have when they use it.

I have a 2009 iMac and a little netbook running Xubuntu. The iMac has 4gb RAM and the netbook just a single gig RAM and not even 2ghz processor. The netbook doesn't slow down on me while the Mac is prone to freeze ups. I Could say ""Linux is better than my Mac because it doesn't slow down"" but that's not fair. They each have their own pros and cons and I don't see one as being better than the other, it's all a matter of preference.<p>When the slowdowns bother me I look at usage. On the Mac I always have 4 spaces open (the dashboard is not set as a space on my Mac), and at all times I have the following apps open: Mail.app, Terminal.app, Chrome w/>=5 tabs at a time, MAMP, CodeKit, iTunes, and Sublime Text. Then Photoshop is open a lot in a addition to a lot of others that get opened at times. On the netbook I've got a terminal session, Chrome, and Sublime Text. That's it. It's no wonder the Mac slows down. So I'd say look how you use the thing. No machine has unlimited performance and when it comes to memory usage it's a lot like money in that the more you have the more you tend to spend and you never seem to be able to have enough.",1329149291

If the OPs time is worth so little that they'd rather stew for 5-10 minutes every day waiting for repair permissions to finish, then that's simply their choice. FWIW, I haven't done anything like that on my 4GB MB Air since I bought it, and it almost never gets rebooted. Granted the SSD makes VM usage a lot more transparent, but still...<p>The software installation comment displays a lack of understanding of what's going on with the App Store; e.g., it's new, things are still ramping up, etc.<p>As an aside, my 2-cents to anyone new to the platform is to stay away from MacPorts. It does things just differently enough to make future updates (outside of what they provide, or before they get around to providing it) a potential time-sink to sort out.

By allowing a de facto distinction to exist between hardcore abusive pornography and other forms, we are essentially saying that <i>some</i> types of child pornography are okay. This primes individuals to regard possession as acceptable; this is why reddit's inaction until now was so reprehensible.<p>I understand that the legal system is unlikely to investigate  cases of child pornography that don't consist of egregious child abuse. That's fair. The legal system has a limited amount of time & money.

VCs don&#x27;t care about your deep algorithm knowledge or domain experience unless it can accelerate user-facing interfaces to the moon.<p>If you hire people with 30 years experience, do they know what a Gruntfile is?  Do they know the difference between Gruntfile.js, component.json, and package.json?  Do they know the relation between Docker and Vagrant and Kubernetes and CoreOS and rkt and etcd?  Maybe they still love XML a little too much.  Now they have to re-learn the same things they already knew, but with new fads and new syntax and new bugs built-in, all while trying to keep &quot;old ways&quot; vs &quot;new ways&quot; straight in their cluttered heads.<p>Even look a hyper-accelerated areas: Ember?  Angular?  React? React forks?  Become an expert in any single one and you&#x27;re irrelevant within 3 years unless you want to support &quot;legacy&quot; apps forever.<p>Saying &quot;old&quot; is confusing too.

All people, the kings and emperors included, are fully aware of the violent and economic repercussions when you only tax poor people.

9711042,comment,9704698,9710448,0,0,toyg,,,"<i>> Eurobonds would indeed solve this for small countries, but would effectively lower the overall standard in the long term.</i><p>It&#x27;s unrealistic to think the whole of Europe will ever have the exact same economic standard as Germany. This doesn&#x27;t happen even in the US, which have been a proper federal union for more than a century now. If we want a real union, we will have to harmonize things in both directions -- and yes, that means the Germans will have to endure in similar ways as they did when they annexed the DDR. The FED makes economic policy choices to suit the whole federation, not just California or New York.<p>If this does not suit the German people, then maybe we should just give up the federal project altogether.<p><i>> So lets start with easier tasks and save money by creating a single European military or introduce single European welfare systems</i><p>The military is already highly integrated through NATO, to the point that the UK for months relied on French capabilities for their naval aircraft carriers, while their own were being repaired or manufactured. If you mean integrating foreign policy, that&#x27;s much harder than harmonizing a bunch of financial arrangements, because it&#x27;s the sort of thing the man on the street will have an opinion about: ask a taxi driver what an eurobond is, and he&#x27;ll just blank out. Same for welfare. Besides, you cannot integrate welfare without common money pools, because welfare is by definition <i>subsidiary</i>: the rich pays for the poor. So if you want an integrated welfare, you need integrated finances, and integrated finances require integrated debt, i.e. eurobonds.<p>Integrated finance and debt is the next big step for the monetary union, there is no way around it. Most people did not realize this had not been done when the Euro was introduced, and now we&#x27;re seeing the problems that come from this approach. I like to think that the Maastricht &quot;forefathers&quot; actually expected this to happen and let it be, like Hari Seldon would have done, in the assumption that European elites would inevitably get around the inevitability of certain hard choices once faced with them. It&#x27;s a more optimist view than thinking they were just idiots.<p><i>> Good luck getting the UK to do that.</i><p>The UK does not belong in a federal EU. They should be kept in a friendly economic zone, but they should be excluded from any decision-taking body, like it should happen for any country not adopting the Euro. Otherwise the fedealist project will forever remain a dream. This I&#x27;ve been saying for 20 years, btw. There is no point trying to keep them in -- England is the unofficial 51st State and will remain so for the foreseeable future. I say that as an European UK resident, so against my best interests, but it&#x27;s the hard truth. If excluding England means losing the more &quot;europeist&quot; NI, Scotland and EIRE, so be it.<p><i>> And now we have a coalition of far-right and far-left wannabe rockstars.</i><p>Tony Blair <i>really</i> was a wannabe rockstar, and he ended up being the most skillful politician of his generation in the UK, and one of the most influential across the whole of Europe. So let&#x27;s leave the weak ad-hominem to tabloids please. Besides, there is more economic policy intelligence in one of Varoufakis&#x27; fingernails than in you and me combined. You have to face the fact that these guys are actually <i>good</i>: they took a smalltime leftist operation and got them in government. They managed to coopt some of their worst enemies on the right and basically took them out of the game. They tried to build a coalition across countries with similar interests, and the failure there is just due to political weakness on the other side (Hollande is hapless, Renzi has no electoral mandate, and Spain is in the process of changing government), although there is some evidence that they might be coming around the idea of putting pressure on Merkel. If you don&#x27;t help them now to establish a modern bureaucracy and statehood, you&#x27;ll condemn Greece back to colony status, with periodic <i>coup d&#x27;ètat</i> and all that. Which would be very dangerous, considering the Russian neoimperialistic approach and eternal instability in the Balkans. But if you make them heroes to their people, making them appear as the saviours of national pride, they will have the political capital to make bolder choices in any area.<p><i>> The German chancellor is a physics graduate</i><p>Apologies, I got tripped up by UK exceptionalism: I referred to the chancellor in UK terms, i.e. the minister of Finance, Schauble, who is in fact a law graduate and much to the right of Merkel. And if the Merkel coalition is the most social-democratic effort Germany can produce, Europe will soon be a thing of the past.",1434204471

9711040,comment,9710757,9710757,0,0,bane,,,"This is basically correct, but it&#x27;s shaped by a few historic factors (note I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with all of these, just putting them out there):<p>1 - The U.S. was almost constantly engaged in a domestic or near-territorial war of some kind from its founding until quite a few years into the 20th century. [1] During the time period the U.S. massively expanded, strengthened itself by defining borders and internally squashing various kinds of rebellions. Since then, the U.S. has basically been at war continuously. America is, believe it or not, a kind of warrior culture.<p>2 - The U.S. usually is able to claim some kind of victory out of most of its military endeavors. Thus military engagement is seen as a tempting, low risk, policy tool. The historic level of military success the U.S. enjoys is almost unprecedented in history. By selectively choosing engagements it knows it can win, the U.S. can continue the development of this legend.<p>3 - Domestically, Americans tend to think of our military actions as generally being benevolent in nature (e.g. stopping communism, fighting nazis, freeing subjugated peoples). The outstanding economic success of many countries who&#x27;s soil we fought on and then built strong alliances with (Germany, Korea, Japan, France, etc.) feeds into this mythos. The post-war alliances we&#x27;ve formed help to &quot;encourage us&quot; to get involved.<p>4 - The modern state of the world&#x27;s powers, an outcome of WWII, is one in which the U.S. is militarily uncontested by any power on the planet. The relatively few conflict deaths post-WW2 [2] seems to imply that U.S. military dominance brings peace, stability and prosperity and helps drive the notion of the <i>Pax Americana</i> [3]<p>5 - The failures and generally poor outcomes in countries under other major power&#x27;s influences and policies feeds into this as well. For example, at one point a majority of the land-mass on the planet was engaged in Communism, under Russian control (as the U.S.S.R.) or influence. Despite access to tremendous natural resources (and short lived modernization programs), the Communist countries failed to produce economic successes and were often engaged in tremendously damaging internal conflicts.<p>6 - Pax Americana is viewed by Americans as a &quot;good thing&quot;. Even though Americans don&#x27;t view themselves as expansionist colonial powers, they view the expansion of the Pax via the export of American culture and influence as a good thing. This implies then that the current state of American dominance is a good thing, and that anything that even looks like it might be vectoring towards threatening that status quo (e.g. belligerent Russia, rising China, trouble on Allied borders etc.) needs to be aggressively halted or stopped.<p>American policy is generally framed as #6, with 1-5 as a supporting framework. If thought of on purely military terms, American military expenditures and actions can&#x27;t really be rationalized. If thought of on terms of #6 they make all the sense in the world. There&#x27;s a lot of self-filtering involved too. Americans ignore the failures and negatives surrounding military action, and the various excesses that come with pouring something like half of the government&#x27;s discretionary funding into the DoD.<p>But the illusion of continued threats is one that we&#x27;ve created in order to continue on justifying with what we generally believe is a better world under our influence than the one that existed before.<p>You can hear most of this echoed when fairly sensible ideas like &quot;maybe Americans should pull out of Europe and let the Europeans, who are economically and technologically able, to deal with defense needs for themselves&quot; are floated. Responses (even from Europeans) are often along the lines of &quot;no, European countries can&#x27;t be trusted to cooperate well enough&quot; or &quot;remember the last time Europe was left to sort things out?&quot; and so on.<p>This also ignores entire continents like Africa, where Americans just simply can&#x27;t figure out what to do at all. Our national notion towards Africa is basically to just ignore the continent and work on Middle-East containment instead. These days when Africa comes up at all, it&#x27;s usually in terms of growing Chinese influence.<p>1 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_Uni...</a><p>2 - <a href=""https://vimeo.com/128373915"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/128373915</a><p>3 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Americana"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Americana</a>",1434204443

It&#x27;s a move up or stay a programmer for 40 years career.  You decide which appeals more to you.  People forget that hiring and accessing talent is mostly done quite poorly. There are not many unemployed programmers and the reasons why they are unemployed could be many things.",1434204241

You have a couple of &quot;leads&quot; and &quot;platform engineers&quot; who make the structure of what needs to be, and then you hire a bunch of &quot;coders&quot; to actually turn that structure into a reality, and its great for the company, since they won&#x27;t question the stack. Whereas, a more experience engineer, will have intelligent discussions about languages, frameworks and tradeoffs.<p>In other words, companies <i>want</i> stooges so that they can still keep running without addressing the ridiculous technical debt that they have accrued.",1434204226

It&#x27;s common in the Baltimore / Washington area to base salaries on years of experience, education level, and industry certifications.  I&#x27;ve applied for jobs where the first question HR asks is do you have at least 10 years of experience.  These jobs pay as good or better in absolute $ terms than any salary range I&#x27;ve ever seen for engineers in the valley and if you look at it from a cost of living adjusted value the valley pays a lot less.<p>My two cents is that preferring young employees has a lot to do with the fact that they will work for a lot less money and put up with housing situations that more mature people wouldn&#x27;t tolerate.",1434204079

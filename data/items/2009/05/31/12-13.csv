I guess there's <i>hosting</i> at sourceforge, google code and github - but are they easy to browse? (I've never browsed them... I just had a go at github, it's mindbogglingly slow to serve every page, also few java projects).  I'm asking these three (3) questions out of curiosity.",1243774256

634641,comment,632702,633139,0,0,tow21,,,"Speed? Not sure if this is actually what the OP was thinking of, but pass-by-value usually implies copying, while pass by reference just involves handing around a pointer.<p>ie, if you had an enormous immutable value (in Python, a tuple with lots of entries), then in a hypothetical Python implementation which did call-by-value, it might be significantly slower than call-by-reference, on account of having to copy the entire tuple.<p>But this falls squarely into 'implementation detail' - if you're so inclined, you could implement either CBV or CBR in hundreds of other ways. Certainly from the perspective of time-independent program behaviour you shouldn't be able to tell the difference.",1243771768

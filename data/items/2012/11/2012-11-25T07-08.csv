4827620,comment,4825893,4826708,5,0,cromwellian,,,"I was part of the Lemonade group for a time, and one of the big arguments for a new submission technique, when it was proposed during my membership, is that ISPs were doing more and more blocking of port 25 and 587 from user connections to fight spam, and some mobile carriers had even more strict filter. I worked for Oracle at the time and we were actually proposing SUBMIT-over-HTTP because, drum roll, HTTP routeability was less complex and more predictable, and far less likely to run into end user customer support issues. I don't know who proposed the benefit as 'tcp connections are expensive' because sending mail is a rare event. We were much more concerned with traversing 3g networks, ISPs, and corporate firewalls.<p>There's also cases like, if you want to forward an email, on a mobile device, you'd have to download the email + all attachments, and then reupload the message through SMTP. The Lemonade group came up with hacks to do forward without download (BURL + IMAPAUTH) or CATENATE, but my guess is, if you have an advanced mailstore backend shared by the IMAP and SUBMIT servers, it could be a lot simpler if the servers were unified.<p>I do think the IMAP group was often too pragmatic, too stuck on maintaining compatibility with ancient systems, and not as concerned with end user / customer issues, and more concerned with the feelings of a few implementors.<p>When you consider someone like Google implementing mail on a BigTable cluster, or Oracle on some of their RDBMS (Oracle Collaboration Suite), putting forth arguments that new features must somehow be relevant or not upset ancient mbox based systems seems silly.<p>I think if one were designing a mobile email client and scalable server today from scratch, you'd be crazy to design a protocol like IMAP.",1353830354

I have my Prime membership and sometimes I watch stuff on there, but it's always been about the free 2-day shipping, and that's why Amazon will have my business indefinitely (i.e. until I don't need to buy physical things) whereas Netflix lasts only as long as my availability/desire to watch passive entertainment does.",1353830285

4827605,comment,4827231,4827534,4,0,csense,,,"Your anxiety is misplaced.  I've lived in the US my entire life and I've never witnessed a crime involving firearms.<p>If gunpowder had just been invented, and guns only existed in the hands of a few companies, scientists, and inventors, then gun control might work.<p>But since the USA was originally (from Europe's viewpoint) a vast, wild frontier, guns have been very common throughout the USA for all of its history.<p>Pretend that firearms were magically outlawed in the US tomorrow.  But there are millions already in circulation.  So people who are determined to get a gun, aren't concerned about following the law, and are willing and able to pay, would certainly still have access to the weapons.<p>A firearm ban would only punish conscientious, law-abiding citizens who want firearms because they're a fun hobby, or to protect their families from armed criminals.<p>And then there's the <i>other</i> reason for the Second Amendment:  Revolution is the final defense against tyranny.  Power corrupts, and the people who started the USA were under no illusions that the government they created was perfect and would remain so forever.  If a future US government somehow manages to undo all the Constitutional safeguards and exercise unchecked power, or finds some clever way to be really crappy to the citizens while remaining within the letter of the law and the Constitution, the people can always withdraw their consent to be governed, and, being armed, can have a decent chance of winning.<p>Remember that the Second Amendment was approved not long after the USA's independence from Great Britain, and its authors had personal experience with armed revolution against an oppressive government.<p>Many people who are unfamiliar with firearms tend to have a visceral reaction:  They're scary and bad.  Think about how many people who are unfamiliar with computers tend to have a similar reaction.  Try to move past your prejudice and try to find <i>reasons</i> for your beliefs.  If you can, great -- let's have a debate!  If you can't, please spend 30 minutes thinking about your worldview; try to make it logical and consistent by changing beliefs and/or thinking up new lines of reasoning.",1353829431
4827604,comment,4827319,4827442,7,0,HCIdivision17,,,"TL;DR: Probably not on legacy industrial equipment.  Or legacy people.  But maybe if you start from scratch and only involve computers.<p>I was given a good piece of advice when I started work: ""A process engineer's job is to make themselves obsolete.""  I've striven to make sure that I did everything I could to make sure I wasn't needed anymore.<p>And I'm happy to say that the processes will keep me employed for as long as I'm willing.  Not from any self-serving malice, but rather that in the end it's terribly messy.  The sheer inelegance of industrial manufacturing seems to defy strong automation at the meta-level.  And not just because the machines are all only halfway obsolete, new, deprecated, upgraded, documented, up-kept, cleaned, and run (halfway to spec).<p>It's because to a computer, this mess quickly degrades into special cases.  Lots of them.  There actually are some shockingly clever software packages out there capable of the early stages of what you're describing, and - this is the kicker - they all require specialized engineering support to create, install, train, and use.  The end product can be handled by a floor worker or management, but at some point you've got to explain the situation to a computer somehow, and that ends up being as complicated as programming.<p>For a much better written punchline, I'll defer to the short story Profession by Asimov [1].  I think it's cynical to think we'll never be able to solve the 'original thought' problem, but I also think it's easy to underestimate it.  Things really are different today than 30 years ago, so perhaps a few more iterations will lead to tape-machines that can program the tape-machine programmer tape-machines. [2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.abelard.org/asimov.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abelard.org/asimov.php</a><p>[2] Perhaps the worst part is we sorta already have this.  There was just a post on the LLVM [3], which discussed how a computer translated and optimized a division command into machine code.  That used to take a lot of work, and it took Real Programmers to optimize that code before this sort of automation.  So it's not inconceivable that your ideal comes true.  But I am cynical enough to think sami36 is right [4]: Doodleware is past the horizon.  But computers that can talk to computers is probably in sight.<p>[3] <a href=""http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/11/24/life-of-an-instruction-in-llvm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/11/24/life-of-an-instructi...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4827459"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4827459</a>",1353829400

4827602,comment,4827163,4827243,1,0,duaneb,,,"> Netflix's problem is that there are no switching barriers to keep viewers loyal to Netflix.<p>Sure there is. Nobody else has Netflix's library. If I bought the shows I watch on netflix from iTunes or amazon, I would probably sink 10x the money in. I've probably spent around $300-400 on netflix over the years, and I've watched many times more content than that. Ad-free, subscription, with lots of content.<p>Let's look at the competitors: Amazon prime, which is cheaper but has only a few titles that set it apart (West Wing is the one that caught my eye). Of course, prime is worth it even without the video library, so perhaps it's not the best comparison.<p>Hulu has a much smaller library, and its paid model has ads (which renders it unacceptable for me). As a free service for watching recent TV, it's alright, but that's not really the same market as Netflix.<p>iTunes, Google Play, etc etc, are only worth it if you watch <$8 of content a month or want to keep up with current television.<p>And, of course, let's all remember the biggest competitor in the room for the generation that's most likely to consume internet content: piracy. It has the best selection, best price, best quality- it really only fails on a convenience level.<p>I also think that the download-the-drm-video is destined for failure. People want large collections, and anyone building that collection with video you don't own for that much money is either stupid or has a lot of money.",1353829337

With Avis First (free to join) or Hertz Gold (last I knew there was a fee, but that may have changed), I take a shuttlebus to the rental car lot (or at the smaller airports, walk from the gate to the rental lot), look for my name on the message board, walk over to my car, get in, drive to the gate, show the attendant my license and I'm gone.

For example, the Poisson distribution is uniquely determined by its mean, so it also forms a monoid by the same reasoning.  The Categorical distribution is also implemented in the HLearn library as a monoid.<p>The beta distribution is uniquely determined by two parameters called alpha and beta.  Typically, these represent the sum of observations we've seen of some events.  (On the same website is an example with heads and tails from coin flips.)  The beta distribution forms a monoid simply by adding these parameters from each distribution.  This is very similar to the Categorical distribution, and also generalizes to the Dirichlet distribution.<p>Things get really interesting when you stop talking about distributions, and start using them in the context of actual machine learning algorithms.  If you know how the Naive Bayes algorithm works, for example, it should be plausible that it forms a monoid in the same way that the Gaussian forms a monoid.

This is not a pay level that would be associated with a job that requires a high degree of skill.

In the US, it is up to the people in line to enforce the norms with other people in line. In Japan, there is usually an 'authority figure' nearby. This person may have no legal authority (other than a store uniform) but people defer to them.<p>Huge lines can work well in any country. If they do, they are usually well attended by staff. An exception to this would be theme parks where extremely rigid pathways and geography of the line as well as distractions prevent any kind of disputes between line-waiters. Some US stores like Whole Foods use a single line and have staff/technology to help enforce fairness.<p>In Japan, even small lines of 3-5 people at banks or stores are well-attended by staff who have an eye for fairness. This small-line behavior then tends to leak into situations where there is no attendant staff.<p>Line-waiting behavior is one of the most fascinating things to look at when travelling.

That is the business model that the-second-coming-of-Napster had: flat fee for most things, but per incident out of pocket for some items.<p>From what I understand (it probably isn't important enough for me to pull a reference on it, but I give talks on ""the business models of Apple"" and have done it before), Apple charges the same 30% processing fee for music downloads that they went with on their App Store, which probably leaves them with 10% after fees and costs, which then is in the competition range for the DVD service.<p>(I actually find the DVD model weird, as it seems like a short-term solution...either DRM is going to win or it is going to fail, but either way everything is going digital: in another 5-10 years, I find it difficult to believe--but am probably wrong anyway--that the notion of ""borrowing a DVD"" won't have been entirely replaced by ""renting a download"".)<p>Again, though: it is a nasty precedent to set that would lead to a very tempting conflict of interest, so they probably just need to ""not go there"".

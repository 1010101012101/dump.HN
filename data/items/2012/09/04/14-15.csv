I'm still a bit skeptical that ""growth hacker"" really adds any value though, especially since it seems to be somewhat amorphously defined, and it's a label that anyone can anoint themselves with - much like ""Social Media Expert"" or ""SEO Expert.""<p>Get the industry to stabilize on a clear, consistent, meaningful definition of what a ""growth hacker"" really is and some criteria for being one and maybe it becomes useful.<p>I mean, Growth Hacker is a shorter phrase than ""marketing specialist who can code, with specialized knowledge in product management, viral growth strategies, and data analysis.""

4474786,comment,4474338,4474642,12,0,talmand,,,"Actually, PC gaming is one of the biggest overlooked markets in the industry. If you account for all available sources of revenue then the market is incredibly large; it's just that some people who tally numbers only count boxes sold over the counter.<p>Almost every computer sold today with AMD or Intel CPUs have a decent video card built in. It's true they won't run the latest and greatest in high quality graphical games but I bet they'll run 90% or more of the games available on Steam just fine and most of the rest with reduced settings that will match the quality of the consoles. Granted, there are exceptions to this.<p>Most games that are ports of console games are done cheaply because of lack of focus or budget, not because of hardware. There are several franchises out there that make a ton of cash if made for and marketed to the PC market correctly. Most publishers don't bother with PC gaming any more because they no longer understand the market. What consoles are today is what PC gaming was five to ten years ago and they still get that, it's easy. PC gaming today is different and the expectations are different. Companies like Valve that understand the difference are the people making money. When the expectations of the console market catch up with PCs (possibly the next generation) then the current publishers better adapt quick or they'll suffer.<p>Most of the larger computer makers have been marketing ""game"" PCs for years but there have no standard configurations because different customers want different things. I, for one, feel that's to the consumer's advantage but it does require a knowledgeable salesman that help make decisions.<p>Your thought of an Ubuntu box with Steam is interesting but I can't see it happening any time soon, they need many, many more games to run on Linux for it to happen. It would be interesting if they did though.<p>If Valve went this direction it would help fix the biggest problem PC gaming has ever had, Microsoft.",1346770261

In context, though, that sentence could just as easily be just an example of one way in which innovation in the Mac/PC space has stagnated.<p>The alternate interpretation that this person will be designing whole systems is equally plausible to me, especially given their investment into the Linux space.  Initially, that move didn't make a whole lot of sense because the Linux desktop space is so small and (particularly where issues around graphics drivers and the like are concerned) requires a fair bit of technical acumen.  A ChromeOS-like strategy makes much more sense, though: heavily tailor the OS user experience to fit your specific target audience, and vertically integrate so you control the hardware, and the user never has to touch drivers or configs.  Then it's not ""Linux,"" anymore, it's ""SteamOS"" or whatever.",1346770004

If you ask someone, ""Please implement a Java class that has the following methods and behaves like this"" you might expect any competent programmer to finish within ~3x of each other.<p>But given some more nebulous task, where architectural decisions must be made and serious research and testing needs to be done, it's not surprising at all. For example, if you asked someone, ""Please write me a library so that I can send and receive XMPP messages,"" I would expect a large number of otherwise competent programmers to make a significant number of false starts and poor decisions, and generally take much more time than the guy who has experience writing libraries and interpreting text protocols. For example, consider the case of Ron Jeffries and Peter Norvig writing a sudoku solver[1] (this example is a perennial favorite of mine in all sorts of discussions).<p>And I don't think anything is ""very seriously wrong"" with this situation. Different skillsets and competence levels result in drastically different results. I think this is true of any profession that is largely about creative problem-solving: some can do it efficiently, some cannot. Programming is just a unique case because there are so many people trying it and not being deterred due to poor performance because there is such a demand.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ravimohan.blogspot.com/2007/04/learning-from-sudoku-solvers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ravimohan.blogspot.com/2007/04/learning-from-sudoku-s...</a>",1346769895

4474675,comment,4474166,4474166,17,0,robomartin,,,"The time and cost to fix bugs can have a huge variance which is sometimes dependent on the nature and field of the software being written.  There are bugs that take seconds to fix and others that take months.<p>I have personally experienced hunting down a bug for six months nearly full time (10 to 12 hours per day) until it was finally found.  This was a real-time hardware system and the code was that of an FPGA.  The culprit was a coefficient in one of many polyphase finite impulse response filters.  The calculations used to generate this coefficient were done in a huge Excel spreadsheet.  At one point, in the hundreds of equations in the spreadsheet, the author had used the ROUND() function when the ROUNDUP() function should have been used.  This was enough cause a buffer issue in the FIFO feeding the polyphase filter.  These are tricky problems to track down when you are literally looking for events that take somewhere in the order of single-digit nanoseconds to occur.<p>On the other hand, there are those bugs where you know exactly what is going on and where in the code it is happening the instant you see the behavior.  We've all experienced that during the course of software development.<p>Fixing bugs for a dating website has vastly different requirements than, say, fixing bugs in a flight control system.<p>One argument is for more up-front planning in order to avoid some bugs.  At one point this can quickly become counterproductive.  Sometimes it's better to just start writing code and fix issues as they come up.<p>Now, if we are talking about fixing bugs after the fact, that's a different matter.  One example here might be if you inherit the code to a complex website or an engine control system and, without any familiarity with the code, are required to fix bugs.  This can easily take cubic time as it requires to learn the code-base (and sometimes the subject matter) while also trying to hunt down bugs.<p>This is why I tend to take such tables or studies with great skepticism.  I haven't really paid much attention to these studies, but I remember looking at one or two of them and thinking that they tended to focus on narrow cases such as fixing bugs in-house, with a stable programmer team and great familiarity with the code base.",1346768996

On the plus side, I'll have a canvas performance chapter out in two books in the near future.<p>Here are a couple off the top of my head really quick:<p>* pre-rendering is most applicable to text, especially text that never moves (Such as buttons). In fact, any text or complex paths+text to make things like buttons should be turned into pngs. Drawing text and changing fonts is extremely slow.<p>* re-use your gradients as much as possible, and try to avoid creating them in loops. If you have one gradient that fills several figures you should be making it only once. The function createLinearGradient(x0, y0, x1, y1) goes from one point to another, but you can make your gradient at the origin createLinearGradient(0, 0, toX, toY) and then <i>translate</i> it into the correct location for each figure made in the for loop.<p>* cache cache cache canvas properties. Never ever set any of them more than you have to, `font` especially. The setter for `font` and the fill styles can change the value so setting it to the same value twice might not be a no-op. It's up to you to make it so. And setting the font especially is really, really slow.<p>* Avoid save and restore, use them rarely if ever. The only time you should ever really need them is because there is no resetClip currently implemented. For transforms you can can track of them yourself, here's a simple file I made to do that:<p><a href=""https://github.com/simonsarris/Canvas-tutorials/blob/master/transform.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/simonsarris/Canvas-tutorials/blob/master/...</a><p>* fillRect(x,y,1,1) will always be faster than 1x1 putImageData(x,y), but 400 fillRect's will be slower than a 20x20 putImageData(x,y). How often the fillStyle changes will change that hand-wavy metric of mine. If you're placing a lot of pixels in a single frame you should definitely test both to see which is faster in your scenario.",1346768142

Whilst a lot of the comments on this thread show that some people look at Kickstarter contributions as donations or investments, I don't think that that's the case for the large number of people putting money into some of the kickstarters that get funded via the site, in particular kickstarters focused on making a physical product, where the product features heavily in the reward tiers<p>I'd also say that the site itself doesn't make it that clear, that the money is an investment or gify.  From the Kickstarter proposals I've read I don't see them heavily mentioning the idea that the backer won't received the reward at the tier that they donate to if the project doesn't succeed in creating the product.<p>If you look at some kickstarters that have big delays on their delivery (e.g. Zioneyes <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zioneyez/eyeztm-by-zioneyez-hd-video-recording-glasses-for?ref=live"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zioneyez/eyeztm-by-zione...</a> ) there seems to be a large percentage of backers who were expecting a product and aren't very happy not to be getting one after over 12 months)...<p>Definitely from a personal perspective I'm more careful now about what I back and specifically the track record of the project creators (i.e. have they done this before).",1346767875

After all, its a book, not a research paper. The point is, it gets more expensive to fix a bug later on.

However, one thing I still lack is a good solution for reading texts offline and highlighting quotes in there. There's instapaper, kippt, and many others, but they all just allow offline reading, but no offline highlighting. There's one solution, which does kinda work, but the offline support is wonky. I'm seriously considering building a small app that reads read-later lists from different services and saves the quote data somewhere else via an API. Would quote.fm allow something like that? I see there's a read-api, but I haven't seen a way to add an article or add a quote for an article. Or did I misunderstand something? You can also hit me by mail for further discussions if you're interested. terhechte AT gmail com",1346767356

In modern times, they've largely been replaced by scientific values. This was a big debate around Darwin's time (replacing the classical ""liberal education"" in Latin and Greek with modern scientific study.) It's also increasingly prevalent today, as universities are basically just for career-preparation. The dominant metric when evaluating universities is almost always ""earnings following graduation"".<p>[0] I don't necessarily agree or disagree with Classical values, but I do think we should sit down and make our own decisions, rather than blindly do it because Franklin/Plato/etc. says so.",1346767298

I was pretty sure I was going to go into Rails development, and we were planning on doing the next project in Rails, but Yii is actually very good.<p>It's not built around creating DSLs, it's built around using solid OO principles to build a very extensible system.  Yii's use of behaviors (much like mixins in Ruby) allow you to easily encapsulate behavior and share it among many models and projects, and of course it's built on a solid foundation of classes and interactions, including ActiveRecord.<p>I still dislike the syntax a bit, and I understand how the syntax affects the design of the framework, but really it is very similar to Rails.",1303253826

If we take out the ethnicity factor and go into personalities your argument is the same as saying that it is embarrassing and damaging for Librarians to be labelled as boring and strict, for Managers to be labelled as conniving bastards and idiots, for Artists to be labelled as always high on drugs, for Nerds to be labelled as outcasts and acne ridden.<p>I consider your argument flawed in that stereotyping will always have an element of ""there's some truth in your fiction and some fiction in your truth"".<p>Fiction and Fact are two completely different things. It's a good thing many people appreciate fact.<p>> This is tantamount to saying ""I have a right to perpetuate racially-based stereotypes, despite any claimed or real negative effect they have, because my ability to be funny depends on it.""<p>Not just my ability but also that of the Film Industry, TV Productions, Stage Plays, Books, Music, which all continue to use any form of stereotyping for good or bad.",1303253765

2464558,comment,2463135,2463135,1,0,donofrip,,,"I can certainly appreciate and understand Leo's point not only philosophically but also through personal experience. I work at an investment bank and have about $200k in student loans. I want to start a company. My time is extremely constricted due to the nature of my job, and I can't quit because I have loan obligations each month. I've backed myself into a corner at a young age. I still have found time to begin putting into place some of the pieces necessary to launch a startup. At the same time, I have been training for a marathon, acting as a member on the board of director for a grade school and catching a few drinks with friends on the weekend. It is not easy and not always fun, but if something is important, we can always find more time. Sometimes you just sleep less...<p>Taking this a step further, there is something left out of Leo's discussion. Efficiency. Not sure where I read it, but the was a book by a CEO. He discussed how he used to work on his plane trips across the country because he didn't want to ""lose"" that time. After a while, he found that he was jet lagged and would be tired while on the ground for his meetings. It would take him days to recover. Now instead of working on the flights, he sleeps or gets enough sleep so that he will be rested and more efficient when he has landed.<p>The question that arises is simple. By jamming another 30 minutes or an hour of blogging or whatever into your day, do you jeopardize your efficiency throughout the day? It is the economic question of not only diminishing returns, but negative returns. The common example given in economic textbooks is that of an additional farmhand not only not adding value, but detracting from the value of the current farmhands.<p>I think we should be asking how can we prioritize more effectively.",1303253470

2464550,comment,2462340,2462340,2,0,heliodor,,,"Making significant money off mobile apps is a little more complicated than just releasing a clean app.<p>Here's what comes to mind to be able to produce a decent advertising revenue:<p>- the app needs to be useful on a daily (or so) basis<p>- the app needs to provide regular notifications to remind people of the app's existence and to draw them back into the app<p>- the app needs to have inelastic, strong demand. To give you an example of what I mean, I built the 'Spy Camera' app. That's the kind of product that has a strong demand. I've been charging $6 most of the time, and people buy it! I've made $25K over two years without have any of the above elements. Strong demand goes a long way. But this works for selling apps, not for advertising revenue. The revenue from the ads in the free version of Spy Camera is barely noticeable.<p>Click-through rates are much higher when the user starts the app on his own as opposed to getting there via a notification. Quantity vs quality.<p>Also, if you take a look at the OG's apps, he places the ads right next to the buttons. That kind of stuff won't fly in Google Adsense. It does on mobile, for the moment. Google will fix that in AdMob, then every other network will do the same or risk losing the advertisers. Nobody wants fake clicks.<p>Finally, notice the OG's profitable apps are random catchy stuff that appeals to the general population.<p>Clearly, the OG has done his homework. Don't think money will land in your lap by just releasing a shiny app.",1303253189

Sry, but this article is far from being objective.\nIf you're going to say that a missing garbage collector is a feature, you could be one of those guys who use C for string operations.

Of course: low(er) level languages have their justification (and I tend to like working in them!) - but the programmer is the one who should decide when to use what.

2464458,comment,2462678,2464217,1,0,vessenes,,,"The published spec conceives of halving the number of bitcoins a block miner receives every n years (4 or so?). Right now, a block miner will get 50 BTC. In a year or two, they'll only get 25. A few years later, 12.5. The Sum of the BTC generated before the block generation gets really really little is roughly 21 million.<p>As has been pointed out copiously today, that's a convention that BTC clients and users all claim to agree to. It seems likely to me that they will continue to agree to it, and it also seems likely to me that the major hurdle will be the first '25 BTC/block' downgrade. If the community survives that, the others will likely follow easily.",1303251380

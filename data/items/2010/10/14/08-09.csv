If I do what I am good at that can be the win-win situation. I am not especially good at the frontend work they described. I mean I could do the job, but it is not my strength. I am better at creating algorithms, and I am also more enthusiastic about that kind of work. Also they mentioned lots of dynamic languages. I am better at a job where I can go deep into problems preferably using only one or two languages. And I better like let's say Scala than all those dynamic languages. I am also a speed-optimization enthusisast: at speed all those mentioned languages suck. Company culture is important, but by far not the only important thing.",1287046781

1790300,comment,1789134,1789134,0,0,_corbett,,,"I go even further and am of the opinion that data provenance is the overarching issue. Any series of results should be able to be re-generated quickly (as measured in scientist-time not computer-time) based solely on meta-data provided–and this is the key point–as part of the results themselves. A few simple guiding principles could go a long way toward achieving this goal.<p><pre><code>   1. In the absence of a well defined standard, it’s the individual scientist’s/consortium’s responsibility to define and actively use an organized meta-data standard.\n   2. If it’s not open source it’s not science.\n   3. A snapshot of the source code used to generate results should be given/pointed to when the results are presented.\n   4. Minimizing reproduction time is an integral part of science.\n   5. Principles 1-4 should be be demanded, by funding agencies, program heads, and research advisors.</code></pre>",1287046558

Flexibility is a plus.</i><p><i>We like pragmatic people who get things done. We're looking for someone relaxed and with the ability to think about the product as a whole and their impact on it.</i><p><i>You don't have to be world class at everything, but you should be willing to get your hands dirty with everything from database design to javascript to system administration to customer support and customer development.</i><p><i>We're profitable, have hundreds of thousands of users and a rapidly expanding user base.

Are you sure?<p>Sorry, I didn't mean you couldn't reuse favicons - I meant to point out that the icon for 'social media' is the same as  for 'search my bookmarks'.<p>> How could I fix the Google category? I could add a line break before each textbox, which would align all the textboxes, but then it would cause more vertical space to be taken up. Any suggestions?<p>Yeah - take up the vertical space, or take up more horizontal space. Either way, it's not an unacceptable amount.\nAlternately, have 1 box (that auto-grows vertically to handle addresses) and have 4 different submit buttons.<p>> You can bookmark the current page! It's in the main menu, the first item. Just click it, or drag and drop it anywhere into your Toolbar.<p>That, specifically, is unclear. I know what page I'm already on; don't show me the title. Have it be an 'add' button instead; at least have the word 'add', if not 'add bookmark' in that menu. My less specific complaint is that <i>so</i> much really cool functionality is 3 clicks away(1 for the bookmarklet, 1 for the menu, and 1 for the actual action), when it could be 2-clicks. Especially if there's only one child item; eg in the UD category, the only choice is UD define.<p>> One problem I'm encountering is that there is so much stuff this toolbar does, I don't know where to start.<p>Who is Dashler for? More specifically, do you have any clue what bookmarklet penetration is? (I have no idea how I'd even go about gauging that. Maybe arc90 stats or something?) One possible approach would be 'the bookmarklet to end all bookmarklets' if users are at all familiar with the concept.<p>> Clicking an icon on the toolbar ""locks"" the menu, so that you can highlight text or drag and drop something into the menu.<p>Yes, it does and it's kinda cool - but I'd consider the click-activated locking a droppable feature, just have the menu not close so automatically instead. Same goes for the 'windows'. I get that it's an iframe and does have some reason for being differentiated from a menu, but for user's ease of use, I would not have the iframe be different than any other menu.<p>> In terms of real estate, that's a good suggestion. However, I think if it takes up too much space it could end up getting in the way.<p>You could go overboard, and implement a 'dashboard' level takeover of the page. That would be a slightly different product with a slightly different focus.<p>> Per your UD problem, everything in the toolbar can be moved. Go to reference -> urban dictionary -> and drag the shortcut by it's icon. You can place it outside of the subfolder if you want.<p>Thats cool - but again, the minimum number of clicks is still 3, when it could be 2.<p>> The bookmarklet did originally toggle the toolbar... however there's one use case which made me want to change it to reloading the toolbar: You can log in via the main menu, but then you need to reload the toolbar in order to see your personal toolbar. There is a menu item in the main menu that says ""reload toolbar"" but I figured most people would just press the Dashler button again. It turns out nobody is using this thing anyway, so I suppose anything I do won't matter much anyway.<p>It seems you could code around that - the login form submission sets a flag. If the bookmarklet is re-activated and that flag's been checked, reload the toolbar instead, and clear the flag.<p>> To sum things up... I'm finding it incredibly difficult to come up with a way to explain what the toolbar can do to people in a sensible way. It's starting to bother me quite a bit. How do I explain an abstract concept like ""a toolbar that goes on top of anyway webpage you are viewing, which connects highlighted content with other webpages. Oh, and the thing that connects highlighted content with other webpages is called a shortcut. You can add more shortcuts, and drag and drop them to customize your toolbar. Also, you can access your customized toolbar from any computer! And by the way, you can bookmark pages and it automatically fills in tags from delicious so that later on you can instantly search your bookmarks. Oh yeah, and there are ""tools"" which can modify the page you're viewing, like greasemonkey""<p>Explain to me what a computer can do for me. Explain to me what Excel can do for an accountant.<p>Taking another look at it, I'd break the functionality into two groups. Group one is 'cool tools for the current page'. Readability, any of the analysis, some other bookmarklet tools (like one to change all references to <a href=""uri.jpg""> into <img src>) - basically anything without an text input field. Make this the user's 'dashboard'. (Whether or not you chose to take over all of the user's browsers window is orthogonal to dividing functionality.)<p>Start by imagining pushing only the dashboard features. Push arc90's Readability to the masses: no ads, no distractions. Push the ability to run analytics. Hell, you could make a list of url shorteners and make an entire category out of that.<p>Or, to go another direction, just push the fact that you can share bookmarks between two computers with a such a simple and easy bookmarklet. No special browser needed (past not using IE), no need to even restart your computer, or even your web browser.<p>Make a user page, which is just a list of all of my bookmarks, newest first, and productize  that. Offer up arc90 et al from a 'default' set of bookmarks in the (eg) tools category. If you want to go down the social route, see other people that bookmarked that page, let them comment on it, etc.<p>The other large piece of type of functionality is to act on selected text. There's definitely use-case here; Safari, Firefox and Chrome all have 'Search in Google' as the only option, you've extended that quite far. I don't know how best to implement it - as part of the existing bookmarklet if there is text already selected or as a separate bookmarklet; but on activation, grey out the rest of the browser window, show the selected text in big, and offer up a slew of buttons to operate on it. If I've selected ""Abraham Lincoln"" I want to be able to, in two clicks, to be able to look it up on wikipedia <i>or</i> urban dictionary, or any number of any other sites. (IMDB - what actors have played him in movies? Dictionary? Thesaurus?)<p>That alone would be kinda awesome, actually.<p>All of my other comment's aside, I'd say stop coding for a while and work on polishing the rest of the site<p>But I think most importantly - Don't forget to add the Asteroids bookmarklet to Dashler!",1287044190

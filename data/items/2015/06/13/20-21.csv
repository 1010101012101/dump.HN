Then, of course, it had to be made available to all the security agencies. Remember the demands after 9/11 for &quot;tearing down the walls&quot; between the law enforcement and security communities?

I&#x27;d like to see HUSL colorpicker beside the rival ones (including HSV) to understand if it&#x27;s really more useful. Random generated colors are nice indeed, but I&#x27;m always having a struggle with defining what I want from random, so I want to neglect this use-case.<p>I mean, I never can trust any studies that say &quot;70% of respondents told us that these colors have brightness of 60%, although, technically speaking, this color is brighter that that, so it&#x27;s a property of human eye to perceive these shades brighter than these&quot; for several reasons. I can trust a physical definition of brightness, or as simple definition of color as RGB. There&#x27;s real meaning to that. But what one actually means, when he says &quot;this color is 60% bright&quot;? It is totally a matter of his learning experience, that made his definition of &quot;bright&quot; to be what it is. If one spends enough time working with RGB, he can guess hex-codes closely enough, for him it would be intuitive, as his mental model of color was developed with RGB as a guide. But I doubt any newcomer can say RGB is &quot;intuitive&quot;. Intuitive understanding of any tool comes with real experience of using it. So it&#x27;s not about how intuitive tool <i>looks</i>, but how effective it is after you learn how to use it.<p>So, yeah, at a first glance HUSL looks &quot;intuitive&quot;, but I cannot say if it&#x27;s a good thing or a bad one, without actually trying to pick colors using that scheme.",1434228487

I don&#x27;t know if gcc started as an improvement in pcc or not but for its early years it was both functional and atrocious. Comparing its generated code to the Greenhills C compiler you just shook your head and wondered why would anyone ever advocate this stuff?<p>But the really magical thing about open source is that it never dies. And there is always someone willing to look at the code and fix a bug, or add a feature. And if you had a new architecture and no budget you could not afford the NRE charge of a big compiler company to build a code generator for you. And so it got incrementally better. Bit by bit. And the better it got, the more useful it was, and the more useful it was the more people used it, and then at some point it crossed the point where the economics of using a free compiler and dedicating some staff to fixing the problems you had made more sense than buying a compiler and waiting for the compiler company to fix bugs.<p>It really is a fascinating thing to consider and I expect that someone could write a very entertaining book about it at some point.",1434228426

The borrow checker concept is brilliant, and a huge advance in understanding how to avoid a big class of bugs. We&#x27;ll see that again in future languages.

It&#x27;s funny, because a couple of years ago, a trans-Pacific cable was laid close to the island, but the decision was made to not invest in tapping into it due to the cost--even nowadays, people are interested in improving connections, but it isn&#x27;t a priority. They really haven&#x27;t experienced the internet, at least not in it&#x27;s full capacity, so they don&#x27;t know what they are missing. They know about it from what they see on T.V.

For the most part selling shrink-wrapped software is dead (compared to the 90s), because end users expect native software to be free (in both senses, although the beer sense is probably the more important). The only real exception is B2B software and games. It&#x27;s why the vast majority of developers younger than about 30 are either working on internal corporate software or on SaaS web apps.<p>Nobody will graduate from university with a CS degree in 2015 thinking that they will sell software directly to people. Those graduates will dream of creating or working for a web service supported by ads or subscriptions. It won&#x27;t be any more &#x27;free&#x27;, in fact it will probably be much worse than the shrink-wrapped proprietary software of the 90s (your data controlled by a 3rd party server, tracking for ads, no ability to stick with old versions, software stops working when the server goes down etc). But despite that it feels more morally acceptable to people to work on SaaS, and I think the way freedom is framed by the GPL is a big part of that. People who work at Facebook or AirBnB or Twitter or Google don&#x27;t view themselves as evil merchants of proprietary software. They see themselves as socially aware employees of modern companies who &#x27;get it&#x27; and support open source and free software - look how much open source code facebook and google gift to the world!<p>The marketing push towards open source was a mind blowing runaway success. It killed the most profitable industry ever seen in human history and replaced it with an even more profitable subscription service where a non trivial amount of the work is done for free by volunteers. This hasn&#x27;t impacted developer employment because the overall industry has grown due to the huge number of SaaS companies springing up every day. It remains to be seen if that&#x27;s sustainable. (There&#x27;s enough profitable B2B SaaS subscriptions based companies to mean it probably is, overall, but the ad supported consumer sector is a bit scary, at least from an outside perspective).",1434226125

Not having better than that--consider what you can do with Scala even before you get to something like Shapeless--is not quite unacceptable but short-sighted and limiting because suddenly I as a human have to do what a moderately smart compiler can do around type checking and leveraging types to solve problems.<p>Go&#x27;s general ignorance, and the community&#x27;s general ignorance, to really basic functional programming that so hugely improves your life is probably borne out of the stupid type system; things like composition (Try monads) for error handling, so I&#x27;m not vomiting `if err != nil` everywhere, things like functional transforms for data structures so I&#x27;m not writing for loops until my eyes bleed. And you can&#x27;t really do that in a statically typed language without either blind casts (which Go partisans recommend, because clearly everything should be `interface {}`, remember the days when java.util.ArrayList just gave you Objects?) or generics.<p>It&#x27;s just...dumb, written for the lowest common denominator, and <i>I guess</i> the lowest common denominator is dishearteningly low. Good for them, but having more and more core tools written in this junk makes my job a lot harder because it obfuscates potential problems under a sea of boilerplate and line noise.<p><i>> To me, Go seems to have about the same amount of expressiveness as C and Java.</i><p>I agree with that assessment. Go&#x27;s roughly equivalent in expressiveness to Java.<p>That is a criticism, not a defense.<p>Go being a somewhat more terse Java 1.4 is not an <i>endorsement</i> of the language or the environment. I stopped using Java quite some time ago because my frustrations with &quot;coding with gloves on&quot; outstripped any benefits of the language. (Not the virtual machine. The JVM is fantastic, I love using it. But Java-the-language is Newspeak: if I can&#x27;t coherently describe a solution in its syntax and semantics, I have to resort to worse solutions. Go&#x27;s actually worse for this, surprisingly enough...)<p>Michael O. Church discusses the problems of Java and the problems if the Java shop very well in one of his articles, and in my experience the Go people I have worked with and talked to almost universally fit into that mold (echoing the normal Java ignorance of the outside world, a neat sense of epistemic closure, and the weird desire to rewrite the world into it).<p><a href=""https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/java-shop-politics/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/java-shop-po...</a><p><i>> if C was acceptable, Go is acceptable</i><p>Should C be acceptable? I don&#x27;t think so. C is, in 2015 and in truth in 2000, too stupid to live. For a very long time we had no other alternatives, and it is an effective lingua franca because it&#x27;s dumb enough that you can knock out a language binding in short order, but it&#x27;s a <i>bad</i> language. No memory safety, no type safety (seriously, just review the rules for implicit pointer casting, you <i>have</i> no types to speak of), and nothing, anywhere, to help you not do things that are damaging.<p>Like, I&#x27;m not a C++ fan because it has <i>many</i> warts and creeping features, but if you literally limit yourself to C with classes, std::string/std::vector, and use pointers only in a last resort (preferring references), you have just solved probably eighty percent of the correctness and security problems caused by our reliance on C. (And you cannot practically implement many of those solutions in C without a level of developer discipline that essentially does not exist in the wild. Just having ctors/dtors is literally transformative to writing safe, smart code.)<p>Rust will solve more, better, and I&#x27;m a huge fan of what they&#x27;re trying to do, but isn&#x27;t there yet.<p><i>> And as the article argues, it lowers the bar for contribution, because it restricts overengineering.</i><p>That&#x27;s an argument. I&#x27;d say that it restricts <i>engineering</i>. Which is not a fatal flaw of a tool, there are lots of problems where grunting and bashing your way through it makes sense, but <i>engineering</i> problems often require being able to actually write what you mean, not write what you need to address the symptoms of the inexpressive language <i>before</i> you get to write what you sort of mean if you squint through the garbage it forces upon you.<p>Lowering the bar for contribution is only a plus if it doesn&#x27;t moronize people who are cool with clearing a higher bar.

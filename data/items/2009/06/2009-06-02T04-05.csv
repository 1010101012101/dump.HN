Apple doesn't like their software to run on devices they don't make.  But they can't make every cool device.  So even if Apple managed to crush Android on phones, they couldn't crush Android. And as long as Android lived, it would always be poised to creep back onto phones.  Or whatever replaces them.",1243918175

Build a closed system, grab an inverter, sell power back to the power company, which in many places they are required by law to pay you for. Sell enough power back, you'll get attention.<p>The idea that demonstrating a net-positive process is hard is merely smokescreen tossed up by the perpetual motion scamsters. It's not. It's easy. It's as easy as it is to demonstrate that a gas generator produces power when you add gasoline and oxygen to the system. If you have a process that works, you can generate and sell power to prove your point and go from there. The fact that nobody can <i>quite</i> seem to manage this feat, despite the easy money it would represent if you actually had a solution, is proof enough that it simply doesn't work.<p>A system that pushed out a kilowatt and never stopped would be very easy to prove. It's only hard to prove something when you're sitting there fiddling with picowatts and arguing whether the power comes from the magic process or if you're simply translating magnetism into electricity or some other fiddly, on-the-edge-of-rounding-error sort of thing.<p>Also, any true net-positive process can be turned into this sort of thing, simply by feeding back the net-positive process onto itself. Any net-positive process should be able to produce a kilowatt, easily. (Arbitrary amounts of power, actually, but let's take something thinkably-small.) Again, the fact that they have to resort to fiddly little rounding errors is proof that they have nothing. Any interesting perpetual motion process would be able to power a nation, if it actually worked.",1243917702

637365,comment,637129,637129,0,0,kylec,,,"A lot of the discussion seems to surround the way the Pre interfaces with iTunes, mainly in regard to how Apple could and might update their software to close the hole, under the assumption that Apple actively wants to block the Pre.<p>However, it's possible that Apple doesn't mind that the Pre interfaces with iTunes. After all, the iTunes music store has been facing recent pressure from Amazon and other companies trying to tap into the online music/video market, and customers are more likely to choose or stay with iTunes if they don't feel as though they're locked into the Apple ecosystem.<p>Also, there's the non-insignificant legal matter of leveraging their music store business in an attempt to dominate the personal player market, which can be considered anti-competitive. If Apple does decide to go down the path of blocking devices access to customers iTunes libraries, they will definitely have to tread carefully.",1243916865

637360,comment,637006,637311,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I'd say it's probably a mix of the two. The economy is currently rather crappy and we have no clue of the current situation of the company, perhaps they care more about getting the technology out there than making insane profits. However, the deal probably included shares in PVI and we're just not privy to that information either.<p>Facebook has a user base of ~200 million active users. They have an income of $300 million and only 700 employees. When you consider companies that have a fraction of their customer base, selling for $6B is pathetic. Ford, despite losing money like an alcoholic loses body fluids, has a revenue of ~$150 billion with only 5.5 million customers. Ford gets an average of $27,000 per customer 'per year' (this is based off their revenue divided by their customers, I'm trusting that with a company so old these numbers average out the money you'll give to Ford later in your vehicles life through parts, etc; so essentially the average person pays $27,000 through a vehicles lifetime), Facebook gets a total of $1.50 per customer per year. Compare Facebook to Google, who get roughly $58 per customer per year. So even by internet standards, Facebook is worthless for its user base, it hasn't capitalized at all on its potential market like Google has.<p>Companies like E Ink only have a handful of 'customers' and deal with large shipments. They're probably more comparable to a regional meat distributor than an online industry. They ship their product to only a handful of companies and then it's out of their hands.<p>The only reason so many of us know who E Ink is, is because it's used in products we care about. I believe the type of ePaper that will get a company worth into the billions will be manufacturers of color ePaper like used in the FLEPia. This offers instant conversion into low cost computers, cell phones and mp3 players.",1243916753

Almost all the growth is from foreign money flowing in one way or another, and once money is in China, it tends to stay under Chinese control.<p>Regardless of how the general economy does, the question is: who benefits?

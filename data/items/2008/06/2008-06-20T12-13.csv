222689,comment,222607,222607,0,0,edw519,,,"One of the best decisions I ever made.<p>Is is ""what I thought it would be""?  I don't know.  Because I had no idea what to expect.  (I did my first programming on the job; I started before there was much opportunity to do it on your own.)<p>I have done projects at over 80 companies.  I have gotten involved in almost every aspect of the business.  I have travelled all over the country, met many interesting people (and friends for life), and have constantly been learning and doing.  Oh, and I have earned far more than most of the people I have ever worked with.  It wasn't unusual for me to be earning more than my supervisor and much, much more than my users.<p>I have done lots of work on my own and have taken lots of time off between gigs.<p>Sure, there have been lots of negatives.  I've even thought of leaving IT and doing something else.  I know many who have.  But then I think about it and realize that <i>this</i> is what I still really want to do.<p>There have been horrible working conditions (cubicles), unreasonable people (let's just leave it at that), terrible projects, long commutes, and worst of all, boredom and disapproval on someone else's project.  But instead of whining (present post excluded), I always did something about it.  I either fixed what was broken for me or moved on.<p>Because of modern technology and lifestyle, I am more excited about being a programmer than ever before.  I don't want to sound like an old timer (I know, too late), but I clearly remember how hard it used to be to get good.  I had to go to expensive seminars or to one of the half dozen good technical bookstores in the U.S.  My first computer cost $6000 (double that today).  Now with cheap hardware, google, downloadable environments, boards like this, and Borders around the corner, everything is so easy!  I just can't get enough.<p>For someone even mildly interested in programming, I would say, ""Go for it!""  Get a job and play around on your own.  Learn as much as you can, technical and business, and if you don't like where it's heading, find a way to make it work for you.  Give it a chance.  I'm sure glad that I did.",1213966510

A biochemist could no more easily add to human knowledge about compiler optimization than a programmer is likely add anything to protein folding.  If anything, I would say the opposite of what you claim is true -- programmers are more likely to be interested in leading-edge science as a hobby than the other way around.",1213965686

222665,comment,222418,222418,0,0,nirmal,,,"I suggest making the individual book targets inaccessible when you zoom out. At some levels I can't even read them yet clicking on them brings up a detailed box that covers everything else. You could just do a human readable thumbnail in a corner. Alternatively, you could make a click in certain level zoom into that genre of books.<p>It would also be nice to have a drop down list of categories that could get me to the correct area quickly. This would me like those signs that some stores have posted on the ceiling in the various sections (i.e. Reference, Fiction, Bestsellers...).<p>The zoom out/in method is not generally how I browse my local Borders. It makes me think about going to look at one book and then running up the stairs and staring down to find the next book I want to check out :).",1213964308

Pursue them enough to actually get pretty good at them, it's hard to judge early on. When the time comes to choose a university subject/career, he should go wherever his heart lies.<p>Why?<p>At school I was (<i>really</i>) good at physics, (I got through to international level at the Physics Olympiad) but I never really fell in love with it, and actually didn't go to the international event a second time, as I hated the people there. (I made a couple of friends on the national level though)<p>Programming in my spare time was what I loved most. I ended up doing physics at university based on advice from the people around me. About 2-2½ years in, at the stage where I could no longer get away with minimal work and still get decent grades, I first consciously realised that my heart was just not in it. I finished my degree but haven't touched physics since.<p>Oddly enough, with all my focus being channeled on physics at school and by my parents, I kind of missed out on really getting to know maths beyond what everyone was taught at school. At university it turned out I most enjoyed the maths modules and consistently got the best grades in them, although I unfortunately wasn't permitted to choose many maths electives. Also, my university wouldn't let me switch subjects and carry over any credits, so I didn't.<p>My girlfriend studied maths so I managed to learn quite a bit from helping her out, although I can't help but think that doing a joint CompSci/Maths degree would have brought me more joy.<p>I've stopped taking advice from family now by the way, and I'm a lot happier. :)",1213963673

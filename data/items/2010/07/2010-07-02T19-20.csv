You read it, and it just seems, I don't know, off. Perhaps it's the fact that they illustrated their point with a feature comparison graph dated to 1991 (a fair comparison to the author's use of 1932 data), or maybe it just reads as a long-winded rant as opposed to an intelligent inquiry into the subject of operating systems. You look into it a bit, and it turns out that the author was once quoted as saying that Linus Torvalds is just a loser, jealous of Bill Gates's wealth. You look at their other articles, and see that every one is the same old template: yay Windows, nay Linux, yay numbers that support my opinion, nay numbers that do not.

1482162,story,,,21,12,ANINDIAN,"Tell HN: Outsourcing a Perspective from an Indian CS Student",,"Another day another post: It seems to be a fashion to write a controversial blog post about how outsourcing sucks and how we did it faster than them, which makes outsourcing costlier!<p>Now bing an An indian student who is studying CS at an US university here are my observations about ground reality in India:<p>Unlike other fields outsourcing software dev requires slightly smarter people. So What do smart students in India do? And why do always all articles talk about shitty indian devs?<p>Here is the analysis:<p>Every year top 5% of graduating class from whole India (IIT's, toppers in smaller schools) go to USA for PhD's or join a multi national firm in India (MSFT, GOOG, JPMC, etc).<p>The next 60% either join MS courses in US universities or work for Top out Sourcing Firms such as Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Patni, Satyam etc. Theses firm which now have revenues in billions of Dollars are the significant outsourcing players.<p>Then you also have few mid size firms which have few million dollar revenue per year.
Now the bottom 35% join smaller firms, those which market themselves on hire a coder websites and such.<p>The top companies do not take smaller project, that is unless youre project isnt worth at least few million dollars they dont care.
Thus most of blog posts which talk about management mismatch and shitty projects are working with bottom 30% of the talent pool.<p>E.g. Company like TCS which serves say Pfizer, will have a large team working in india and around 5% people working in USA with Pfizer to co ordinate the whole activity.<p>Sadly most of the stuff such as answers about outsourcing on stackoverflow or blogposts are written by devs who work in small companies, and who have access to a considerably less smarter talent pool in India.<p>Thus as a Final Message: If you aren't working with a company in india that has at least few million $ revenue, you are probably working with wrong people or you are too small to outsource.<p>In India outsourcing is synonymous with the billion dollar companies which bring most of the revenue and not with smaller dev houses which have around 100 employees.
So dont judge indian devs by wrong sample. student who generally work for Infosys and other come to USA after 3-4 years to pursue MS in CS (which in funny way HN'ers think is useless)
and get jobs that pay really well.<p>You can just explore LinkedIn with names of the companies i gave in this post and see for yourself.",1278100567

And it's definitely true that big companies hate making these sorts of decisions, because it's expensive and time-consuming and difficult to undo.<p>One reason a lot of enterprise software gets bloated is that, in order for the market to be viable, it's hard to just target a single niche, so you end up with a superset of features so that you can sell the same market to customers with different requirements.<p>Even in the best case, though, system specialization can be a knife-edge that cuts both ways.  Many of our customers, for example, are in a trouble precisely because they have way, way too many one-off systems.  They have this system over here that does just workers comp claims, and another system for handling personal auto claims, and another system for tracking notes, and an entirely different system for first notice of less entry versus for actually handling claims, and then most of their commercial business is in yet another system, except for some specialty lines that are elsehwere.  Then they have five different policy administration systems, and a couple of billing systems, and each of those talks to a different document production system . . . it's a total nightmare.<p>So sometimes the choice is between having 3 complex systems or 25 purpose-built systems and a total integration and user training nightmare, and both options suck.<p>Basically, as soon as you have a bunch of data that you need to do a ton of different things with, you're left with two bad choices:  you can create one really complex application that tries to do everything, or you can create a bunch of smaller applications and end up with a bunch of complicated integrations.

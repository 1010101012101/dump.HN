A lot of them boil down to rule of law arguments of some sort avoiding arbitrary rules that let you cherry pick the people you want (educated, productive, culturally American, etc.).<p>Maintaining the ability to keep people out when they want in requires cruelty. The tighter you want to keep the control, the crueller. The more they want in, the crueller. If you want to really really close a border, you need to be willing to kill people.<p>Have you ever considered going in to some sort of open battle about this. You're educated. It seems like you have the ability to articulate your position well. You would be able to gain empathy from Americans who will see you as an American under threat of deportation.

823466,comment,822932,823196,0,0,Tichy,,,"To be honest I think I don't understand how ethics work, at all. What else can there be than the ""law of the stronger""? If somebody points a gun at you and wants to steal your car, is there any hope of convincing him through some universal ethical argument that he shouldn't do it?<p>What I can understand is societies creating rules for living together. But all these rules have targets that the individuals decided on beforehand. I don't think anything universal enters it. The best hope for arriving at acceptable ethics is to try to understand the consequences of their application, so that individuals can decide if they like the consequences or not.<p>The only way to compute something comparable to universal ethics then would be evolution in the form of competition among societies and their rules. I understand that one set of ethics might make the society employing it more successful than another one. Even that does not allow for the creation of universal rules, though: the individuals would still have to agree that survival of a particular society is desirable.",1253000570

Samurai is a _new_ object, with a _new_ slot, that _independently_ refers to the same function that yell in ninja refers to.<p>And yet, when ninja is deleted/collected the function yell disappears. This is insanity. In javascript<p><pre><code>    function(n) { blah } \n</code></pre>\nshould be a simple expression that creates a heap object, and heap objects should live until it becomes unreachable, at which point it may be collected.

823442,comment,822492,822492,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Ditto with audio APIs -- the last major change was the changeover from OSS to ALSA, in 2002, and to this day there's an OSS compatibility layer.</i><p>ALSA, as an API for building modern audio applications, is useless.  Yes, literally, useless.<p>I have tried for over ten years to move my home studio recording to Linux-based tools...but, to this day, reliable, glitch-free, low-latency, multi-track 24 bit 96kHz audio from multiple applications and external sources is simply not possible under Linux (without dedicating a machine to the task, which I've never been willing to do, and which I don't have to do under Windows or Mac OS X).<p>First up, audio requires an rt kernel.  The rt kernels trail behind the mainline kernel by several revisions, and usually include a few major security or stability issues.  The latency of a non-rt kernel is such that even with extremely large buffers, audio still stutters.<p>You also need a sound server to permit multiple apps to share and route sound amongst other apps.  The competing and barely compatible sound servers for Linux are targeted to different audiences, and generally don't do a very good job even for their specific niche.  JACK is the professionals choice, but in my experience, it's never been stable enough to be usable for any real work.  PulseAudio is laughably unreliable...it consistently fails when returning from sleep on my desktop, and makes weird popping noises after playing sounds on my laptop.  It never worked at all on my mid-range audio devices (Delta 66 on the desktop and FireWire Focusrite Saffire LE on the lappy), as it seems to just freak out when there are multiple devices (to be fair, Vista also freaks out a bit when changing sound devices and using both for various tasks; I've been able to find a delicate balance that allows Flash and movies and such to play through the built-in audio and audio software to use the good devices).<p>Anyway, I use, and have used, Linux as my primary operating system for all of my machines for over ten years for everything <i>except</i> audio.  I try to make the switch at least once a year, and I've failed every single time because of failures of both the kernel and the audio APIs on Linux.  I'm not a neophyte at this stuff, either.  I've written and maintained patches for the Linux kernel over the years, I'm not nervous about any of the required steps to make things work, it's just that when all is said and done, the system is either not capable of working with high quality audio at all (non-rt kernel, normal desktop PulseAudio configuration), but usable as a desktop system for normal work...or it's configured exactly right for pro audio (rt kernel, jackd, etc.), and <i>sort of</i> works for a few minutes or hours at a time, but is otherwise useless as a desktop system because 3D video drivers are too flaky in this configuration, kernel has stability or security issues, and normal software (like Firefox+Flash) can't talk to the jackd server and can't get access to the audio device because jack is holding it.<p>Music software that does happen to support Linux (Renoise, for an example of one of my favorite tools), there is confusion among the developers about what they should be doing to provide good support to Linux users...which of the several sound servers is the ""right"" one?  It depends on who you ask.<p>So, while I spend 90% of my day running Linux, when I want to record music, I have to reboot into Windows.",1252998950

Along with a charming note about rewards for finding bugs.  Anyway, Leaper graphs are the graphs that describe the moves of a generalized Knight on generalized chessboard. So I researched this some more, and found that Knuth was the first to enumerate all the Knight's tours that are invariant under 180° rotation.<p>At this point I'm thinking, this sounds like it could be an ICFP problem, and a language like Haskell would be ideally suited for it.

Strong winds would require it be pointed into the wind as with any umbrella, however without a rigid structure the air curtain would virtually collapse flat providing no protection whatsoever.<p>To work in all weather this umbrella would have to be able to manipulate its output from virtually perpendicular to the shaft to parallel.<p>Honestly, this might work with compressed air, but that itself would present serious problems; you'd likely only be able to charge it once a day and the cylinder would be heavy, but perhaps not as heavy as the original design. It would also enable the umbrella to have a shaft similar in appearance to a regular umbrella.",1263682728

Such girls are unlikely to have a home to go often, having often been thrown out, and it's very unlikely that they'll have made it through high school, without which job prospects are even worse. They are also likely to have become addicted to drugs, which, while they make their work less intolerable, grip their desires for a long, long time.<p>If your argument is that someone could have, consciously and without any coercion, decided to engage in sex work, then yes, it is possible, it is not even necessarily wrong.

For two reasons.<p>First, hardware (i.e. GPU) acceleration makes a significant difference only when decoding h.264. For h.263 and On2 V6 you shouldn't need hardware acceleration. GPU accelerated h.264 came in Quicktime X in Snow Leopard and is not available on all Snow Leopard compatible machines. The disparity in performance between Quicktime, and other player-codec packages for that matter, and Flash has been around for years.<p>The second, and more important in my opinion, reason is that Flash doesn't have performance and stability issues only when it comes to video. They are more apparent with video, but all kinds of content - games, sites, even sometimes ads - make the Flash plugin disproportionately task the system.",1263682242

The fact end-users have been beaten into submission and now tolerate having to restart their computers after software crashes or to redo calculations because the results were absurd the first time is not relevant to this discussion.

People come to HN because the quality of the discussion is high. With increasing community size comes dilution, but only of the average comment quality.<p>In fact, as the community becomes larger there are more, perhaps many more extraordinarily good comments, so long as the original contributors are all encouraged to continue participating. These great comments are really the key.<p>Consider the Netflix Prize.  Entries were judged based on RMSE.  This is not the right metric, though, because out of all of the thousands of movies in the dataset, only a few dozen would ever be recommended to a given user based on any conceivable algorithm.  And the user only really cares whether the particular movie that they use the algorithm to select is good or disappointing.<p>Similarly, users come here to read the exceptional comments, and a community in which every comment deserved to get 3 karma points would soon find itself without users.<p>In this way, removing comment scores may be part of an effective solution, but it may not be the crucial component because it only indirectly changes the accessibility of excellent comments.<p>Instead, actively trying to make it easier for people to read what they consider exceptional is a goal worth pursuing.",1263681708

The biggest PITA feature of SDB is that it throttles writes in a very horrible stringent way. You can barely tickle a domain and it will throttle you. I never had any consistently good batch puts - they all eventually fail.<p>After talking with SDB folks, they recommended that I shard my data because each domain maps to a different network computer cluster. I'm glad it's the first recommendation in the OP list because it seriously is the best thing you can do.<p>Another trick that I experimented with: use multiple EC2 instance to write to the same domain. I managed to convince myself that the throttling is per EC2 instance per domain, not a global per domain. However, cost ruled this solution out.<p>Reading was much more consistent but was also throttled, especially at high write-loads. The solution was two-fold:<p>1. Cache everything ""indefinitely"" and break the cache when you know its contents will change. For the real time stuff, you can't cache. I used memcached, and looked at other solutions like Tokyo Tyrant, memcachedb and redis. Use what you feel comfortable using really.<p>2. Read as little as possible. Doing a ""select * from domain where..."" is horrible compared to doing ""select attribute1, attribute2 from domain where..."". Once you read, cache.",1263679914

Set up a few scenarios and let them talk and whiteboard their way out of it.  Ideally you'll be able to come up with a range of problems that range from familiar to totally unknown.  The familiar scenarios will tell you if they are bullshitters, and the unfamiliar scenarios will tell you how quickly they can adapt to new environments.<p>While it is true that people who program outside of work tend to be good programmers, it is not true that all good programmers program outside of work.

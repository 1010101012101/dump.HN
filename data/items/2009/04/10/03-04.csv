555669,comment,552764,554783,0,0,tdavis,,,"I think you're misinterpreting exceptions in so much that you feel they need to be unexpected. Say you have a list like [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]. You could count each of the lists and loop through them individually, or you could create a recursive function that assumes a flat list and switches when an index error occurs:<p><pre><code>  def wtf(l, count=0):\n    cl = l[0]\n    try:\n      return wtf(cl[count:], count+1)\n      except IndexError:\n          # Reverse the list and start over\n          cl = l[::-1]\n          return wtf(cl, 0)\n</code></pre>\nHopefully that gets my point across. Basically, exceptions are very useful, and there is nothing wrong with expecting and catching their throws under certain circumstances.",1239335704

555662,comment,555081,555586,0,0,rms,,,">We need a new economic model for goods with real production cost but no reproduction cost.<p>Not only do I think that is impossible but I'm not convinced that it is a good idea. Has any economist ever done any quantitative analysis when the marginal cost of (re)production is zero?  I suspect that there are only obvious models that answer the question by saying that goods with production costs of zero should be priced at zero. In the short term there are all sorts of things you can do to maximize profits when the marginal cost is zero, but in the long run the price will fall to zero.<p>This wistful hope that recorded music will be worth anything is kind of like my wistful hope that a viable economic system will come along that doesn't have a nasty tendency to concentrate the wealth in the hands of those that already have the capital.<p>Is that future you hope for really better than the one where something with a marginal cost of zero is priced in the market as it should be? I strongly suspect that the total amount of music recorded over time will continue to increase even as the cost falls to zero. I'm not sure what is so great about being able to sell digital music anyways. The limited editions seem infinitely superior to me as a consumer and are a great way to add a little bit of scarcity to a good that isn't scarce.",1239335271

555653,comment,555405,555551,0,0,horatio,,,"> Keep in mind, however, that ""making it trivially obvious to the rest of the world, Google, future investors"" is exactly the point of the proposal!<p>Which is exactly the problem-- it's important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There are good things and bad with attaching real world identities and that was not considered in your post. It's not a panacea and has real and (to me, at least) severe consequences.<p>I happen to work a great deal with gaming communities which are notoriously trollish and awful. In my experience, physical identity would help with those problems, but it's overkill. It's like the ""nuclear"" option, in a sense.<p>What we've found works best is the general act of tying the identity to something the individual does not want to lose casually. The real enemy of the net is casual trolling out of boredom or random flashes of meanness. The highest return on investment is found by eliminating that one aspect-- it doesn't require the ""nuclear"" option of turning us all into our public personas.<p>For example, we've found that physical/real-world identity is not nearly as important as the combination of:<p>* Tying access to something people don't want to lose, such as months of their time/effort, their reputation to people they respect, or to their wallets. Note that reputation can be based on limited identity revealing to key people, or even simply reputation amongst people they associate with under a particular identity (even if they whole group is using non-real identities-- for example, a gaming clan).<p>* Broken window theory (i.e. <a href=""http://ta.gd/broken"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ta.gd/broken</a> )-- hiding/fixing trolling as quickly as possible. This is one of the best methods we've found to keep incidents down and people behaving. If they don't see it as commonplace (as trolling is on Reddit/Digg) then they aren't going to dive in as readily.<p>* Having strong, respected moderators/spokespeople encouraging respect and frowning sternly (and directly) upon negative behavior. This ties into both of the above points.<p>My company is actually investigating using some of these techniques in a service to reduce griefing in games, but requiring physical identities in that case is a deal-breaker.<p>> Instead, they have far more incentive to contribute, in order to increase their reputation.<p>This is only true if you believe that people want to increase their reputation solely tied to their real world identity. This is a motivator for you, but it is not for me and others-- otherwise people would already be using their own names 100% of the time on things they are proud of.<p>Anyway, I agree with your desire to keep HN strong. I actually think HN has been doing great for the while I've been here. It has its ups and downs, but I think we have other options to improve that don't include tying Facebook Connect into every aspect of the online world.",1239334504

The problem is that as a feature it's worthless. It can be recreated relatively simply. It has no value beyond the network effect, and it's been demonstrated a bunch of times that the network effect doesn't follow acquisitions (dodgeball anyone? jaiku ftw?). That is the unsolved problem - not how to build a community, but how to monetize one.

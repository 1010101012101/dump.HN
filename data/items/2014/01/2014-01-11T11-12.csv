It sounds like those are some crappy companies. Where are you located?<p>After 30, the quality of jobs that is available becomes higher but the quantity is lower. That has a lot to do with capitalism&#x27;s pyramidal shape. There just aren&#x27;t as many good, age-appropriate jobs, as there are bad ones.<p>Thus, you need to be open to a national search. I&#x27;ll warn you ahead of time that many startups are absolutely shitty when it comes to relocation: either none or some ridiculously small amount like $2,500 (pre-tax!)-- a full-service move, for a 1BR apartment, will burn up more than that. If you ask for 2 months&#x27; spousal unemployment to be included in your relo-- which is just a reasonable request at &quot;a certain age&quot;-- most startups will balk. So you need to save up for that.<p>After 30, every job search might be national. Sometimes you need to go into a beastly expensive tech hub to get the job you want, and sometimes the best move is to get out of those places. Strategically, the best thing to do (if you can stomach the moves) is often to switch between being a bigger fish in a smaller pond and vice versa-- similar to the dynamic of alternating between tech jobs to bid up your autonomy level and technical achievement and finance jobs to bid up your salary.",1389438293

I find that the current crusade against &quot;prejudice&quot; (against different social groups) in programming is largely caused by the fact that programmers have gone from &quot;uncool nerds&quot; to &quot;cool rich kids&quot; during the financial crisis. As a consequence of that, many people wish they were programmers, and they encourage kids to be programmers &quot;because it will earn them a good wage&quot; and not &quot;because it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re interested about&quot;. That is the same reason many people become lawyers and doctors - not because they genuinely want that, but because of the prestige and money one gets by being a doctor or a lawyer. However, personally I would rather be represented/operated by a lawyer/doctor who is in it because of genuine interest, not because of the money.

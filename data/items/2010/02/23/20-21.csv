At the end of one weekend after I had been yelling at everyone in the family for about two days, I quit cold turkey.<p>And those were four days of serious discomfort.  Headaches, cravings for coffee, distractions.  But after a couple of weeks, I was fine and didn't drink any coffee for several years.  The scary part was that my sleep became different after I quit.  More calm.<p>Now, I drink about one cup of decaffeinated a week, max.<p>If you decide to try, it is useful to have a major distraction to keep you busy, like working in a startup, or a cross-country hike.",1266958774

This is the case of when there is ""too much"" individualism, and it is very difficult to achieve happiness without a coherent social structure.<p>""In an anomic society, people can do as they please; but without any clear standards of respected social institutions to enforce those standards, it is harder for people to find things they want to do. Anomie breeds feelings of rootlessness and anxiety and leads to an increase in amoral and antisocial behavior.""<p>Though he is a liberal, one of his points in the book is that the relentless pursuit of individualism without regard to shared values leads to unsatisfying lives.",1266958674

Verizon seems to manage so I'm not acquitting AT&T of any responsibility here but it's another example of US laws & regulations being incredibly unfriendly to infrastructure development. Of course these towers should be safe so some of these regulations are completely valid. I'm more concerned about the privately owned towers whose owners simply don't want to spend the money on new construction or the communities where a small group of civic minded folks are able to stop the construction of new towers for the sole reason that their appearance offends them.

It helps good judgement in some cases but does the exact opposite in others as the underlying dynamics change.<p>It's interesting that some patterns do not seem to change very quickly though. I'm reading ""This Time is Different. Eight Centuries of Financial Folly"" right now. It's a rather dry empirical study of debt crises. The conclusion is that these crises have certain patterns that recur again and again, but each time there are people pointing at new factors convincing themselves that this time is different and loads of debt are OK.<p>So it would appear that a minimum of eight centuries on the job experience would be appropriate for any banker.<p>But even if, as in this case, experience would lead to the right conclusions, I would argue that sometimes it's folly that actually creates value and innovation, even if 3/4 of it is later destroyed in a crisis. The dot com bubble is a prime example of that.<p>The real myth is that older developers work based on experience. Sometimes experience is just a convenient excuse for laziness. Younger developers find other excuses for that.<p>I have 20 years of programming experience but I'm still struggling with the urge not to jump on each and every new fad that's out there, at least when it comes to things like programming languages and paradigms. What I can do way better than any recent college grad is to explain in a very reasoned, professional and well informed way why it is absolutely critical to use that fancy new language or paradigm now ;-)",1266958363

1146370,comment,1145638,1145638,0,0,dkarl,,,"Age-related decline is, according to my observations, caused by declining interest in the nuts and bolts of programming.  When people lose interest, they start relying on high-level abstractions even when those abstractions are inaccurate or inadequate.  Or they rely on concepts they've learned in the past, without learning what's new about the new technology.  It looks exactly like intellectual laziness, but ""laziness"" is not the right word, because it is an unavoidable consequence of boredom.<p>Losing interest in technology is like tires losing their grip on the road.  You keep going in the same direction, no matter which way you point the wheels.<p>Often age-related decline is masked by working in a static technical environment that a person has already mastered.  It's like sliding uncontrollably down a straight road.  Then, when the person needs a new job, they find that they haven't learned anything new in five years, are hopelessly out of date, and can't muster enough interest to learn anything new.  The road finally curved, and they're in the ditch.<p>Personally, I've come to value my ability to be interested in the technical details of computer systems.

This has changed.<p>Founders today have significant control of their company’s formation and development. They no longer have to locate in the Valley but can operate from almost anywhere worldwide. The web has given them <i>vast</i> amount of knowledge about how things work, where they were once relegated to trying to pick up scraps around the water cooler. The infrastructure build-out has significantly reduced their capital needs, where they once routinely needed immediate large funding just to launch their basic product. The desktop PC is no longer a primary software development platform, where it once dominated and defined the range of startup opportunities available. The barriers are down, and there is much more room for sheer drive and talent to hold sway and define the path to success.<p>The dark side has always been there, as noted in this fine piece, and it will remain - doing startups does ""suck"" if one compares it to conventional ways of making a living but that is why the rewards can be large as well.<p>But demographic diversity is today quite pronounced in terms of racial, ethnic, and cultural mix (the white males among the founders I work with are today a distinct minority). Only on the gender side does it continue to lag. On that side, I am not sure how much will change in the near term. Given the otherwise radical changes that have occurred, <i>whatever</i> is causing this state of things to persist must be pretty deeply ingrained.",1266957214

I wish them well.<p>YC is one way to get things started. It provides a pittance of money- $15K isn't really enough to fund substantial development, but it's enough to help build momentum.<p>The biggest thing that YC does provide is Networking and advice. Meeting with PG et all is a great way to get good advice on how improve your product, and how to handle the trickier aspects of running a company, such as buyouts, raising additional capital, and the like.<p>But beyond working with the YC staff, one of the other really nice advantages is working with the YC network. There is an ever increasing group of people who have gone through the same process you are- Who know a lot about what you're doing, and often have Great advice on what to do next.<p>To my mind, they're one of the best reasons to join YC. The problem is, like everything else that YC is facing right now, it needs to scale. Kn0thing can't meet with 400 founders to discuss the sale of Redit to Conde Nast.. While it'd be great, that'd be his new full-time job.<p>Holding a conference allows him to tell the same story once, and have everyone hear it. He can take questions, and answer them for everyone, rather than having 25 people ask the same variation of a question over and over.<p>So to your main point- I love the conference idea, and I think it's a great value-add to YC.

Yes, you don't have to annotate things with types, but in fact, you have to worry MORE about types than using a statically typed language. In a statically typed language with type annotations all over the place, the compiler checks for simple and maybe even less simple errors. If you have duck typing, the programmer needs to do this work, by defining clear interfaces with clear documentations about the expected behavior of an object passed in here or returned over there.<p>In my opinion, this is again an instance of more defensive or more aggressive languages.

Leah Culver springs immediately to mind. My wife, who owns a successful accounting startup is another. I've met countless others, including one particularly memorable engineer at Flock (I'll protect her privacy).<p>The reality is that there are simply very few women that hold the qualifications necessary to be successful in the startup world. When you do find one, the competition for their services is incredibly fierce. In a previous gig I tried desperately to hire a particular woman who had just graduated from MIT. We lost a pretty serious bidding war, not because she was a woman but because her skills were off the charts.<p>It's funny, there are similar articles written about certain disciplines in academia (like accounting). There too it's just a numbers game. My wife, until her latest birthday, was just 1 of 5 female accounting PhD's in the whole country (including foreign born) under 30. Of course there are precious few female accounting professors, there are very few females pursuing accounting PhD's!<p>Of course, that means she enjoys a tremendous advantage over her peers. The pressure to promote diversity means she enjoys a better salary and lot more job security than her male counterparts.<p>The same is true, from my experience, for the few intelligent and talented female engineers that I've met in the valley.",1266955411

If you've presented based on measurable facts, you've still used rhetoric. (Indeed, without using other language to help organize and interpret the facts at hand, it's very easy for facts to be used to confuse an issue.)<p>Parables are rhetorical devices usually used to illustrate a moral <i>or</i> religious lesson.

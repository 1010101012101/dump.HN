Considering the rising clout of china, it could become mandatory for work trade very quickly. Japan is much smaller (population) in comparison, and much more an island where you don't see many Japanese outside of Japan these days.<p>Chinese people are learning English, they are already better at it than the Japanese. But again, huge population, many of the powerful guys don't feel like learning or speaking English for face reasons.<p>Totally agree with you on language choice, learned Japanese in the 90s, never went anywhere with it. Mandarin has been much more rewarding. Take it from me, an American living in china.",1347173963

How much money, hardware and manpower does the team working on Photoshop have?<p>Open source projects deserve our money more than some random platformer game on Kickstarter. Truth is, though, that most FOSS projects do not actively solicit donations, or seem to not know how to do so. People are more inclined to donate when you tell them that their donations will be used to pay 3 developers who will implement features A, B, C and D and make a new release in X months. Nobody will click that small donate button tucked away in the corner of your project website. Nobody will donate when you tell them ""financial help is needed for many different reasons"", quoting from the GIMP website.<p>This move from Google is a perfect example of how donations should ideally work.

However, it does seem that it inserts an extra pointer to the member (beyond the prev/next) in order to avoid the ""cast"". If it indeed does so, it is again less optimal than Linux's list.h.  On 64-bit machines, 8 extra bytes for each list element is not always negligible.<p>Also, the examples do not showcase using the same list member node to put in multiple lists. There's also the unsafety of putting the list node in a union (mentioned in the article) which adds unsafety regardless of templates or not.<p>I agree about destructors improving safety, I was specifically talking about templates.<p>With list.h, it is possible to get the same safety (unless I am misunderstanding something about the boost example) by wrapping the list anchor and node structs with a struct (typically done by a macro to define the anchor/node), which adds an array-of-0-elements of the type of the container. This allows adding the same type checks demonstrated here using templates, implemented in the list iteration, insertion/deletion and downcasting macros.",1347172528

4495100,comment,4494666,4494666,2,0,ryanmolden,,,"Realizing that life is in fact long, relatively speaking. The current culture seems to imply if you aren't successful yesterday you are a failure. I think this mindset is deleterious to any serious undertaking/success. I am a strong believer in the old trope about being an overnight success in only 10 years. The important thing is to think about areas you are interested in, think about the necessary skills and begin the long trudge to learn them. Of course no one wants to hear this, they want the TL;DR version, but the joke is on them as it doesn't exist. My approach, if I were you, would be (long list ahead):<p>1: Find a job. Preferably in a field you can be passionate about, but really anywhere works to get a good routine and a reason to wake up. I worked nights in a warehouse through college, not an easy or fun job, but a great motive force to keep me on track in school.<p>2: Pick one skill of the N you think you ultimately need in your dream future. Spend at least the next year learning everything you can about that area. Find online forums, find educational materials, go to the library, haunt local meetups/talks in the area you are learning, ask really stupid questions to make sure you deeply understand things, ignore what others may think or say especially if their feedback is non-constructive (the world is, sadly, full of dicks).<p>3: Find someone in the area whose work you respect and try to contact them for any advice they may have. Most people, in my experience, are open to this as long as you aren't too needy/rambling (like me, right now), respect that them even taking time to write a single sentence is a gift, they really don't have to and lots of people are rather busy.<p>4: See if you can figure out ways to provide value before ever asking for anything. Perhaps someone has a PDF version of a book in the area you want to learn. Read it, take notes of typos, confusing points, errors. Reach out to them and ask how to send feedback (e-mail, forums, etc...) and give them what you have. People like favors, doing them will build positive capital for your future.<p>5: Repeat step 2 as many times as necessary.<p>6: Always be on the lookout for opportunities (jobs) that you are perhaps suddenly qualified for via your studies. Never eliminate yourself from a candidacy unless you clearly lack most required skills for the job. Make them say no to you, don't say it to yourself on their behalf.<p>7: See a doctor/counselor if you even suspect depression. Treatment exists and can be life changing.<p>8: Try to stay in shape. This can be as simple as taking daily walks/runs, swimming, joining a gym, just something to stay active. It helps a lot with mental acuity and focus. I myself struggle with this one, but I always feel better the more regularly I honor this.<p>9: Try and expose yourself to serendipity. This generally means go to talks, visit forums like HN, do everything you can to be exposed to the area you like and people in it.",1347171824

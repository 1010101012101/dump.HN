It took years of research and development, lots of money and brainpower, it's very far from being trivial (in fact it's so complicated I have to admit I don't understand some parts of it) and it's light years ahead (in terms of usefulness and speed) of any other algorithm with similar applications.<p>Obviously the last thing we want now is simply handing it over to our competitors, after all this work. If the patent system didn't guarantee us monopoly on using the fruits of our own R&D, this algorithm probably would not have been developed for a very long time, if ever, by anyone. It would have been innovation that never happened.<p>My point is that the threshold of what can patentable should by way higher, but I think we need a (software) patent system none the less.",1306929110

Linux will only compile correctly on a few recent versions of gcc, you cant compile old kernels on new gcc or vice versa.\n2. There is a lot of inline assembler (including oddities like x86 16 bit code) that has to work exactly as specified, such as for creating memory barriers say, or other low level constructs. Inline assembler is non standard, although clang does now implement the gcc stuff.\n3. You are making an ABI, so everything must be laid out exactly the same way. Portable C does not give you exact control of padding, again  there are gcc extensions.\n4. Testing is hard - there are a huge number of optional modules, as well as SMP and non SMP builds, so even if you build the code with a new compiler without a lot of people using it it is hard to be sure it really works. There is no test suite...<p>Probably some more reasons too...",1306927015

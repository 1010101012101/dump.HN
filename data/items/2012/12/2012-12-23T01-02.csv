Lets go over the points one last time:<p><i>""Well, they do exist as mass-produced devices that can be hacked.""</i> - Absolutely, that was why I mentioned my USB extender device, it too uses the A9X CPU that TP-Link is using. Nobody has yet seen fit to offer a 'general purpose' unit (ala the RasPi) for sale, but if you're willing to commit to the large volumes and upfront costs that are needed you can make a few hundred thousand.<p><i>""Designs can change on you overnight and you are screwed.""</i> - also exactly right which is why these aren't ""parts"" rather they are a lean way to bootstrap a prototype. Sometimes you can duplicate the OEMs design, sometimes they rely on side relationships, for example TP-Link builds a <i>lot</i> of stuff, so they may get a much better price on the A9X CPU than you could even buying a lot of them.<p><i>""I posted the ""wish"" to HN because I've been out of the loop for about two years and just didn't know what's available. The iMX233 @ ~$5.00/100 (not thousand) is impressive enough. Still, not ethernet without going through USB first. That chip, as far as I can tell, seems to be the lowest cost potential to approach the $25 to $35 price range in reasonable quantities (100x to 500x boards)."" - Yup, and some chips like the STMicro 32F107 (Cortex M3 ARM) which has Ethernet on chip is under $6 in 100's but doesn't have the MMU. The A9X also has ethernet on chip but I've not been able to wade through the Chinese well enough to figure out what to order (these things power the $35 android tables in the back markets of China).<p></i>""I think I can consider an all-up cost of about $50, in the box and ready to go. This includes the assembled board in an very simple enclosure and a regulated wall adapter.""* - You might be able to do that, but you may have a hard time find them in the retail channel for that. Even the RasPi is over $50 when you add power supply, case, SD card, and a serial interface.<p><i>""Right now I have a very mild itch I am thinking of scratching. Just looking around to see if it even makes sense.""</i> - Ah bingo! If you read nothing else, read this. I can guarantee that you will eventually be able to get this for $25. Build your idea out of any of a dozen different ideas (ideally one where you have good software resources or kernel support) and <i>then</i> you have ""in your pocket"" an idea that is almost ready to go if you can get the price down. Then you watch the channels, EE Times, etc and predict when the pricing is going to cross your threshold. Then about 6 months before contact the folks who are going to make that possible (chip vendors etc) and then partner with them to get early access. Then you can ""ship"" on the same day general availability hits.<p>Bottom line if the idea works don't worry what things cost right now, get the leg work done on stuff which has to be done regardless of chip availability.",1356227920

4958251,comment,4956823,4957737,1,0,csense,,,"> real estate prices are artificially inflated by restrictions on the construction of new housing stock.<p>How do you explain the housing crisis?  The backlog of unsold homes that developed in many parts of the country says to me that prices didn't fall far enough.  That is, due to the way market participants act, housing prices are ""sticky"" like wages.  Sellers (mainly banks) apparently would rather let a house sit vacant and unsold than set sale prices at levels that would allow the market to clear (and take big capital losses).<p>I'd say that it's clear evidence that real estate prices are inflated -- not by zoning regulations, but by perverse incentives produced by the way real estate lenders keep their account books.<p>This falls in line with the picture that, due to the loan bundling practices that were encouraged by US government agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the owners of most housing loans weren't the same as their originators and hence, this created an incentive for the originators to make loans to people who couldn't pay them in the long run.  Which increased demand in the housing market due to allowing these borrowers to enter (their shaky financial status would have been excluded them if they hadn't had access to the questionable loans), which caused prices to rise.  Eventually a lot of those borrowers (predictably) went bankrupt and exited the market, dumping the extra supply (now-vacant houses) on the banks (which obviously promptly put them on the market, since being homeowners is out-of-scope of most banks' business plans -- they'd much rather be the creditors of homeowners, a role they're much better set up to play).<p>But prices couldn't fall again and return us to the status quo ante, because not enough sellers were willing to go with Option A:  Sell for whatever buyers are offering, and take an immediate capital loss in their books.<p>The banks were more willing to go with the alternative, Option B -- tolerating the damage over time of the taxes and expenses involved in owning a vacant house for many months or years.  Although the costs of Option B would, over a sufficiently long period, dwarf those of Option A, the short-term incentives of upper management -- encouraged by short-term thinking common among investors and, indeed, endemic in the financial industry as a whole -- made Option B more attractive due to its better short-term results.",1356227552

This sounds absolutely absurd, I know, but it is the truth. If you go to China, you can practically buy direct from many factories, or you can go through a broker who actually does know the source factory. This does not happen in America, at least in my brief experience.<p>I used to be responsible for finding US sources for certain products. If you aren't aware, you'd think that the price of a US-made product is 10x that of China, when in reality, it is just the supply chain that is 5 people deep, but only if you really work at getting it that low. The amount of ""middle men"" is absurd. I reversed engineered quite a few supply chains, and even managed to get in contact with the source, but there I was blocked. I had to go one person higher, but that person refused to speak to my company. I then had to go one person higher, and they refused to talk to me. I ultimately ended up going up 5 levels away from the source, but even that is not a chain, but more like a web. If I was able to buy from the source, or even two levels away, the price of the products would be cheaper than China.<p>The final slap was that the person I finally managed to get a ""yes"" from was not willing to work with me unless I worked specifically on their terms. I won't go into detail, but their term was 100% unreasonable. The fact is that the supply chain in the US is far to complex and it is based on protecting profits. US-made items are not inherently more expensive than Chinese products, but even those with clout have to deal with long response times and an ever-growing web of middle-men. Simply hiring a Mandarin speaker to call China is far quicker and easier.",1356227012

I know I'd be a lot healthier if I did it for a year. But the upfront expense, the pain, and being incredibly bad at it for the first few months just makes it so I don't even try- even though I know the benefits could be life changing.<p>I bought a copy of Agile Development on Rails and gave it to such a friend. He didn't know how to pull up a command prompt, and I realized that he didn't know what a text editor was. Or that you'd run things from the terminal, and type them in the text editor. I helped him get past that, but he never focused in on it and never saw the beautiful and amazing parts of it.<p>Another friend got a little farther. But I soon realized how much 'background' knowledge he was missing. I pointed him toward some free online CS courses, which helped. But life got in the way and it just wasn't the #1 thing for him, so he got distracted and quit when he moved to a new (small) city.<p>Another friend wanted help getting started. He was motivated, but we hit a major problem. He's a student with an older iBook. We had huge issues setting up Ruby due to various environmental problems. I didn't have the time to really redo his entire system, but I wasn't able to get Ruby installed easily since he was on 10.3 or something ancient.<p>Just telling people that there are boatloads of money to be had, and that there are tons of resources out there doesn't always work.

I've read tons of complaints here on HN over that language.<p>I think that it's impossible to predict what will be hot or not in the future. You have a zillion frameworks, plug-ins, and languages competing for mindshare, and I ultimately think that no one of these will be 100% dominant. People who like Lisp are going to love working in Lisp no matter what, and those that don't, wont, and it's that simple. You can't expect people who are most comfortable working in Java to move to a Lisp, and you most certainly can't ask a Lisper to do something that looks at all like Java.<p>I think one thing that will stunt Clojure, is the death of SICP at MIT and Berkely. SICP makes and excellent case for immutability and functional programming, and that knowledge is now more difficult to find and teach. I think the semi-movement from RoR programmers testing out Clojure wasn't going to last, and if people thought that RoR programmers were really going to move to Clojure and make it popular, with its lack of frameworks and anti-OO philosophy, they weren't thinking about the situation too well.<p>Regardless, Clojure is the only Lisp that currently has a chance for wider adoption, with Heroku and the JVM.",1356225571

It allows you to give people access to git and only git (as opposed to git's built-in system, which requires granting ssh shell access); and it only uses one OS-level user/group regardless of how many people it's managing.<p>Either of the above solutions are for your compsci professors who are clued-in enough to be comfortable with CLI in general and Git in particular.<p>If you're trying to give files to technically clueless humanities professors, I'd suggest only using Git privately, to develop your paper or whatever, then using a plain old email attachment, or hosting on an HTTP server, to submit the assignment.

I'd recommend prgmr.com for hosting; their smallest plans should be able to fit even an undergrad's budget, and you have full root access to your (Xen VM) system, so you can do all kinds of fun and exotic experiments.  It's not necessary for basic usage, but you can install any version of any Linux distro, use LVM, even use a custom-compiled kernel or FreeBSD (the only requirement is guest Xen patches).  It's great because if you have problems, they give you access to an ssh-based out-of-band console, rebooter, and rescue image so you can fix them yourself.  (By contrast, many other hosts require you to make changes through some half-baked web UI that lacks half the tools you need, require you to install only approved distros and only do OS upgrades on an approved schedule, and require you to file tickets with lengthy turnaround times and/or fees in order to do the most routine troubleshooting or maintenance tasks.)<p>Disclaimer:  My only relationship with prgmr.com is that I've been their hosting customer for a long time (and very happy with them given the nonsense I've had to put up with from other hosts, in case you couldn't figure that part out from my above rant).<p>My only relationship with Gitolite is a project user.

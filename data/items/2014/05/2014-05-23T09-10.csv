7788630,comment,7787707,7787707,5,0,netcan,,,"I started working in the &quot;internet economy&quot; around 2004, when the web was coming back. I worked on several small eccommerce projects and I read a lot of commentary. I really thought ecommerce imminent industrial revolution scale.<p><pre><code>  - Affiliate marketing was a buzzword. \n  Adwords ads placed by affiliates were common. \n  - Dropshipping was a buzzword. \n  It seemed like a matter of time before all factories would be dropshippers. \n  - Google had just made online advertising make sense\n  - Amazon had survived the bust\n  - Hosted carts were getting good. \n</code></pre>\n<i>Joel Spolsky (2001)- Indeed during the recent dotcom mania a bunch of quack business writers suggested that the company of the future would be totally virtual -- just a trendy couple sipping Chardonnay in their living room outsourcing everything.</i> - I was one of these believers.<p>But, I didn&#x27;t believe that there were long term businesses to be had gluing  together all these things. If all the eccommerce &quot;site&quot; was going to be doing was paying affiliates and forwarding orders to dropshipping suppliers, that could be all automated. If all affiliate marketers were doing was pointing links to products, they could be &#x27;eaten&quot; by a product search engine like (the promising new Google Products).<p>Eventually what we would have is factories, postmen & search engines. All the intermediaries wouldn&#x27;t be necessary.<p>What I thought I was seeing was the etherialization of the entire retail-to-manufacturing chain. When a product starts getting produced, it puts itself on the ether. People buy it. It gets shipped factory-to-consumer. The efficiencies are mind boggling.<p>It turned out that all the details I thought would be solved, turned out to be bigger barriers than expected. Even a small-medium retailer that wants to buy direct from factories, will have a hard time, never mind the consumer. Online transactions still suck. Shipping still sucks (in many places). The experience is still &quot;of.f&quot;<p>That kind of &quot;etheriazation&quot; didn&#x27;t even happen for digital products.<p>But, I think that we are still moving in that direction. The Alibaba group IPO is a hint at steps in that direction. They are working closer to the manufacturer end of the manufacturer-consumer chain.<p>&quot;Modern supply chains&quot; is a big and hard to understand part of the transition too: H&M, Zara, Dell, Tesla. These are all examples.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to wrap it all up. I think that retail is being eaten by software, but it isn&#x27;t happening on the 5-10 schedule we expect from &quot;eaten by software&quot; revolutions.",1400838682

I&#x27;m not an extreme left-wing myself but I happen to know some and I&#x27;m sure as hell that they cannot be compared to paedophiles or corrupt cops. In any case you can use some other -less extreme- examples to make your case. (Added bonus insight: Being Greek I&#x27;ve grown tired* of home grown right-wing official reasoning/propaganda that tries to equalize Greek neonazis with Greek left-wing and extreme left-wing parties. The way you phrased your examples is exactly the way some of the clever propaganda is constructed in Greece.)<p>* I also know how dangerous such propaganda is as it only serves to raise nazis poll percentages.

Again, without touching the code. Just the first step, in which static content and dynamic content were separated, reduced the servers down to about 60, so down to about 1% (!!) from before the optimization. Added to that comes an extreme reduction of the rendering times (from 6 seconds down to < 1 sec), potential front-end improvements are still not used (about that some more in a bit).<p>These are numbers that inspire some serious thought, and also the answer to the question of whether having Dev-Ops in your company is useful: Yes.<p>A very good example for what the amateur PHP/MySQL/Apache-stack itself can do in the high end-segment of performance.<p>Is there more?<p>From the current perspective (the presentation is now 2 1/2 years old) it is really interesting when one compares the performance jumps of the recent PHP versions (php 5.7 is up to 30% faster than PHP 5.5, which was much faster than php 5.3), and when you compile the whole workd using HipHop or when you start using optimized nginx. Front-end wise there are a lot of possibilities nowadays, binary image files can be compressed extremely without much visual loss (take the first .png you have on your desktop and ship it to tinypng.com, and that&#x27;s only for starters!), Icons can be sent as zipped paths or sprites, and a shipping an (almost) empty body and then to use javascript to populate the page is also relatively normal. This can save 50-90% of traffic and requests, and associated CDN costs.<p>In short, the &#x27;beginners stack&#x27; with PHP, MySQL and Apache definitely has the tools to deliver high-end websites.

They can be can (and should be) adaptive. While n=1 does provide perfect fairness, but what if switching connection cost just as much as processing 1 request? Setting n = 2 increase throughput by 50%, at the cost of 33% longer wait until the last connection is handled. However, because the throughput is increased, any subsequent requests will be handled faster than with n = 1.<p>In reality you want a sane m value, the time allowed to cycle through all connections. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to make this adaptive, but it&#x27;s likely very dependent on the nature of the usage (http connections from a GUI, p2p network, or something else). As long as you cycle through all connections within m time and aren&#x27;t saturating the connection, the algorithm can increase n to increase throughput.",1400835984

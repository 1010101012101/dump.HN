X12 itself is not human readable, and EDI based on X12 (Tradacom, US EDI, UN/EDIFACT) are complex beasts. To complex for average coders. So those coders invent new standards e.g. for SAP, or OASIS.<p>imho, the solution would be UN/EDIFACT. The United Nations version is flexible enough to cover 99% of the real life cases, and improves twice a year, to cover the remaining percent.<p>Take a look at my XML::Edifact CPAN Perl modules, if you want to start with free software EDI.<p>Now EDI is only half of the bill.

The high costs offsets individuals who don&#x27;t pay for their healthcare.  Keep in mind that the hospital must treat anybody who walks in the door and they frequently do not get reimbursed by the government. Also keep in mind that the solution must be perfect when it physically cannot be. Because if there is a .0001 percent chance of failure, every doctor that treated the patient gets sued, the hospital gets sued for several million, the manufacturers gets sued, the middle man gets sued, heck the receptionists probably gets sued too. Think of the costs of insurance for every party involved. Obstetricians often pay $85,000 to as much as $200,000 for malpractice insurance.  That&#x27;s just the doctor.<p>Reduce the malpractice payouts and shield doctors like other countries do. Make the government absorb more of the costs for care.

If the majority of customers (patients) pay out of their pocket then the hospitals would be incetivized to make themselves attractive to patients. Else why the hell do they care? In fact they mark up prices multiple times to offset any unforeseen costs of eating up costs as well. There is no incentive in price transparency, no incentive to compete among hospitals.

Dont waste your time in pointless excercises&quot;.<p>That said, the coincidence that I mentioned is entirely personal. After a hiatus, I am getting my toes wet again in this language that I find quite interesting. Its a whole program analyzed, aggressively inlined, functional, but not purely so, ML like type-checked and type-inferred language with generics that interacts quite effortlessly with C++, without the need for any ffi like library. It has coroutines and preemptive threads.<p>I think of it as something that does the same to C++ what Scala does to Java or F# does to C#. It is really performant and achieves the speed via aggressive inlining, tail calls, whole program analysis and what can be called opportunistic but indeterminate laziness. I have not quite grokked its model yet, one thing that I want to get a handle on is to be able to reason what triggers garbage collection and what doesn&#x27;t. According to the author of the language, garbage collection can be mostly avoided, but I am not yet good at this aspect, but its just been a few days that I have actually used the language (as opposed to reading about it).<p>Its statically typechecked but feels unusually flexible in one aspect: one can move functions and types around the between and across different translation units freely (for refactoring) without the need for forward declarations because the linkage semantics are permutation independent.<p>The language that I am talking about is Felix <a href=""http://felix-lang.org/share/src/web/tutorial.fdoc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://felix-lang.org/share/src/web/tutorial.fdoc</a> <a href=""http://felix-lang.org/share/src/web/nutut/intro/intro_index.fdoc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://felix-lang.org/share/src/web/nutut/intro/intro_index....</a>.

4470958,comment,4470460,4470460,21,0,nkoren,,,"I was trained as an architect and worked in the field for over a decade. Drawing had and still has an important role to play in all of my creative processes. However...<p>It's all to easy to put drawing on too high a pedestal, and Michael Graves is possibly the best example of the dangers of doing so. His drawings are pleasing: humourous lines, stimulating juxtapositions of shape and colour. But they are <i>not</i> architecture, and Graves' focus on the art of drawing has made him a terrible architect.<p>Architecture is not experienced in two dimensions: it is experienced in four. It is only ever seen in perspective and in time. What it looks like as a two dimensional projection is irrelevant to the actual embodied experience of architecture. People who spend too much time immersed in drawings tend to lose sight of this.<p>Moreover, architecture is not just a visual. It also creates a tactile, acoustic, and olfactory environment. It conveys ambient and radient temperatures, and channels the movement of air. It exists within diurnal and seasonal and social cycles, continually changing. Drawing can represent NONE of this, and the architect who approaches their art purely through drawing will lose sight of these facts. Graves certainly has. His buildings -- rendered in three dimensions, out of actual materials on actual sites -- are tacky-feeling, hollow-sounding monstrosities: dank where they should be airy, glaring where they should be shady, completely disconnected from their environments, and not remotely conducive to work or socialisation or rest or any other purpose that humans might want to put a building towards.<p>But hell, they look great on paper, and that's what counts, right?<p>The truth is that architecture is a difficult art, because it cannot be iteratively developed and refined in the same way as other arts. If you're a painter, you paint; if you're a musician, you play music until your fingers bleed. But if you're an architect, you develop your art through indirect representation. Through virtual reality, as it were. And drawing is just another form of virtual reality -- better at representing some aspects of architecture (emotional characteristics of a design, for example) -- and almost incapable of representing others (four-dimensionality, acoustics, tactility, air). It should be quite an important form of representation within the architect's toolkit, but if it's too highly prioritised, then you'll end up as bad an architect as Michael Graves. A well-balanced architect should develop <i>all</i> forms of representation available to them -- both visual and non-visual -- if they are going to fully grasp all aspects of their art.",1346690604

The graphics adaptors of others, in the same laptops, had no similar problems.<p>Someone may argue that ... oh, wait, you do make this argument:<p>> High performance graphics chips are going to get hot.<p>Yes, but if they reliably melt down, that fact negates their impressive specifications.<p>I'm imagining an advertising campaign in a parallel universe where everyone has to tell the truth -- ""Nvidia -- the hottest graphics processors in existence!""

I work full time on it (including most weekends).  I've been working on this project for ~1.5 years with a few small breaks.  I outsource small things like PSD slicing/coding.  I work with a talented designer on the UI.<p>It's not sustainable in the sense it's making money now, it's made a small amount off the beta but nowhere near livable.  I've got other income sources and keep expenses to a minimum.  Burnt through most of my cash building this and committing full time.<p>Motivation: joined Affinity Lab (coworking space in DC).  I have a hard time getting work done outside that space now.  Why I end up there til 1am on a saturday night.  It surrounds me with awesome people who understand what I am doing and we help each other constantly.  I don't think I've been there a day where I haven't been helped in some small or large way and helped someone in a small or large way.  It plays a large part in what keeps me going.<p>Validation: I had a private beta in march, the same coworking space was a great place to start getting users.  I also have been reaching out to people who I think would benefit from my service and having them try it.  It has worked pretty well and the feedback really helped.  I built a tool to help automate this process as much as possible.  Which leads into...<p>Automation: love it.  I've built a lot of tools to reduce the amount of time I spent doing things which are repetitive or semi-repetitive.  As a solo founder everything is competing for my bandwidth.  There is a lot of high value, repetitive things (hustling) which I think can be automated to some degree.  I've built some infrastructure to help me do that.  Trying to constantly watch myself and figure out where my time is best spent is important.  However, this often conflicts with motivation: doing some valuable things suck.

That would be like confusing the invention of powered flight with the Wright Brothers -- it was ""powered flight time"" and someone would have done what they did within a few years if they had not.<p>Over the years I was amazed by the regularity with which Steve took credit for the work of others, then, when confronted by this fact, shouted them down.<p>Steve's time at the head of Apple Computer can only be described as ""rule by narcissism"" (a point made by Iverson as well) -- it's effective in a twisted way, and it tends to attract a strange following, but one must hope there are more effective ways to run a company.<p>My favorite ""rule by narcissism"" quote is Steve saying, ""... people don't know what they want until you show it to them.""

4470822,comment,4468426,4469054,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">Secondly, you have to declare the valuation of the patent. This is then taxed by the government, similarly to property tax. If you decide to value your patent at $0, then you pay $0 tax.
>The valuation of the patent determines the damage payment.<p>This sounds more clever than it actually is. Think about it:<p>First of all, this makes the patent system totally worthless to the little guy. If Joe Inventor has the Billion Dollar Idea, he can't value it at a billion dollars even if it is worth that much because the first year's taxes would bankrupt him before he can recoup the money. But if he values it at substantially less than that, the big guys come along and infringe and just pay damages that are way less than the value of infringing.<p>But you can't allow the patent holder to periodically revalue the patent and change the amount of tax being paid on it because that breaks the system, since the big guys could just value all their patents at $0 until they see someone infringing, then revalue them at a trillion dollars the day before they file the lawsuit.<p>And the alternative of not allowing revaluation ignores what a crap shoot patents are. Sometimes you don't know that something is going to take off until it does. If you have five or ten genuinely good ideas but can only expect one or two to gain market acceptance, and you don't know which ones at the time of filing, you can't value them all at a billion dollars or you'll be crushed by taxes, but if you value the wrong ones highly then the patent system isn't providing you with the desired incentive because when the infringers come around you won't be able to collect sufficient damages to deter them.<p>More than that, think about what you would be doing to patent litigation: Valuing an individual software patent at a billion dollars is insane for anyone because of the taxes that would be due on it and because of the potential of someone finding a work-around that makes that valuation worthless, so instead the strategy (much like today) will be to collect many thousands of patents, valued in the low millions individually, but instead of asserting five or ten in litigation, plaintiffs will have to assert a much larger number of them in order to arrive at the desired amount of damages. These trials are a giant mass of spaghetti even with five or ten patents, can you imagine a hundred? So it does nothing to solve the problem of upstanding defendants being coerced into unjust settlements for fear of being crushed by litigation costs.<p>So the taxes thing is not really going to do it I don't think. (And that's before the Tea Party gets a billion dollar donation from Intellectual Ventures to go on TV and scream about taxes on innovators, and before the tax provision gets eaten by all the same loopholes that allow Microsoft to not pay income tax.)<p>Which leaves the suggestion that we need a more rigorous vetting of patents -- and I'm all for that, but easier said than done. Peer review probably wouldn't <i>hurt</i>, but you've got a serious free rider problem. If IBM files for a spurious patent then in theory Google and Microsoft each have an incentive to hire lawyers and try to oppose their application, but they also have an incentive to save money by letting their other competitors do it. And because patents are bought and sold like commodities, you can't just concentrate on fighting your own competitors' attempts to get bad patents, because anyone who is awarded a low quality patent is a potential supplier of them to your competitors, so anyone who decides they want to subsidize their competitors by being the first to start policing bad patents in the industry will have to do so against the world rather than only their own actual competitors. You end up with a situation where nobody wants to be the first mover to start opposing competitors' patents because there will inevitably be retaliation, so nobody does, and all the big players are happier to continue the existing system of everyone big having an arsenal of low quality patents that in most cases just get cross-licensed to one another.<p>It seems to me it would be better to just throw out software patents and be done with it. No one can even agree whether the existing or proposed systems would encourage more innovation than they impede, but no one can dispute that any system of software patents involves the employment of a large army of soul-crushing patent lawyers with engineering degrees who the world would be better off if they were set to work doing actual engineering instead.",1346688509

It appears that you don't like my main point but have no good argument against it or replacement for it; I will respond and try to explain my main point again.<p>One of your points seems to be that the selection of 10 best algorithms is not very good.  I would agree:  I would have selected heap sort instead of quicksort because, given a positive integer n, the execution time of heap sort in sorting n items is proportional to n ln(n) in both average case and worst case and, thus, heap sort meets the Gleason bound for the fastest possible sort by comparing pairs of keys.  The execution time of quicksort on average is n ln(n), and in practice faster than heap sort, but in worst case appears to run in n^2.  Quicksort seems to do better on locality of reference for a virtual memory system, but there are ways to improve the locality of reference of heap sort.<p>For my main point, that the list of 10 best algorithms was well chosen is not very important.<p>Here is my main point again:<p>""For reasonably complicated problems, the key is some applied math, and we take a corresponding algorithm seriously only because of the logically prior applied math.""<p>So, since you don't like this point, I will try to explain in more detail:<p>First, we are considering 'algorithms'.  So, let's agree on what we mean by an algorithm:  I will accept running code in a common programming language -- C/C++, Fortran, PL/I, etc.  -- or something similar in 'pseudo-code'.<p>So, the issue is, given an algorithm, what do we need to take it ""seriously"", that is, be sure it does what it is intended to do?<p>Second, briefly let's return to sorting:  Quicksort and heap sort are darned clever.  But, given the algorithms, in the form I just mentioned, it's easy enough to trace the logic informally and confirm that the algorithms actually do sort.  For the running times, finding those is more work but not very notable math.<p>So, net, for these sorting algorithms, it is easy enough for us to take them seriously for their ability to do what is promised -- sort or sort in n ln(n).<p>You also mentioned data structures.  Well we can say much the same for AVL trees or the data structures used in a fast implementation of the network simplex algorithm for least cost capacitated network flows, etc.  For some of the data structures used in, say, dynamic programming, more is needed to take the algorithms for those data structures seriously.  Similarly for some uses of k-D trees.<p>So, for some algorithms and data structures, we can take them seriously just 'by inspection'.<p>Third, consider, as in the list of 10 algorithms, trying to solve a fairly complicated problem.  Examples could include the discrete Fourier transform, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric, positive definite matrix, least cost network flows, matching to minimize the most expensive single match used, linear programming, quadratic programming, iterative solution of large systems of linear equations (e.g., via Gauss-Seidel).  Maybe we are trying to solve a problem in non-linear programming and want an algorithm to achieve the Kuhn-Tucker conditions.<p>Given an algorithm for one of these problems, to take the algorithm seriously we need more than just 'inspection'.  So, since just 'inspection' no longer works, the question is, how can we take such an algorithm seriously?<p>Actually, there is some fairly tricky math needed for us to take seriously the simplex algorithm for linear programming:  For the set of real numbers R, a positive integer n, and Euclidean R^n with the usual topology, let F be the intersection of finitely many closed half spaces of R^n, and let linear function z:  R^n --> R. Claim:  If z is bounded above on F, then z achieves its least upper bound.  For us to take the simplex algorithm seriously, we need to know that this claim is true.  Note:  The proof is not just usual analysis with converging sequences from Rudin's 'Principles'.<p>For more, given a linear programming problem, it may be feasible or infeasible.  If the problem is feasible, then it may be bounded or unbounded.  If the problem is feasible and bounded, then we want to know that there is an optimal solution and that the simplex algorithm can find one in finitely many iterations.  Since the simplex algorithm considers only extreme point solutions, we would like to know that, if there is an optimal solution, then there is an optimal extreme point solution.  In the simplex algorithm, there is a sufficient condition for optimality, but there can be optimal solutions and optimal extreme point solutions without this sufficient condition.  So, we need to know that the simplex algorithm can achieve the sufficient condition.  The nicest solution to these issues I know of is via Bland's rule by R. Bland, long at SUNY.  It's not obvious.<p>Again, let's be more clear:  Given an algorithm as above, that is, just code or pseudo-code, for the simplex algorithm with Bland's rule, solution of linear equations with double precision inner product accumulation and iterative improvement (Forsythe and Moler), detecting and handling degeneracy (basic variables with value 0), detecting infeasibility, detecting unboundedness, considering the reduced costs as a sufficient condition for optimality, the code will look like just so much gibberish with no good reason to take it seriously.  To take the code seriously, we need some prior math where the algorithm just implements the manipulations specified by the math.<p>Yes, apparently computer science regards the simplex algorithm as an algorithm in computer science:  E.g., the algorithm is discussed in Chapter 29 of<p>Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein, 'Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition', The MIT Press Cambridge.<p>commonly called 'CLRS'.<p>E.g., recently I encountered a question:  For some positive integer n, given n client computers and one frequency band with bandwidth x Mbps, design a wireless network to provide all x Mbps to all n client computers simultaneously.  Is such possible?  Yes.  Does this violate Shannon's information theory?  No.  So, how to take any such proposal seriously?  Sure, some math.  Basically the solution is one heck of a strange 'antenna' pattern with n nodes with each client getting just the node with just their data.  It all boils down just to linear algebra after taking some Fourier transforms.<p>So, again, given a fairly complicated problem, when trying to evaluate an algorithm to solve this problem where just 'inspection' no longer works, the question is, how can we take such an algorithm seriously?<p>Well, to take the algorithm seriously, we need more than just the algorithm, that is, more than just the code or pseudo-code.<p>As I mentioned, one way to take the algorithm seriously is a lot of empirical evidence.  Alas, this can be slow and is not very satisfactory.<p>So, what is left?  You mentioned nothing.  And computer science has nothing.<p>I gave a solution:  Start with the real problem.  Get a solution via some applied math complete with theorems and proofs.  That is, properties of the real problem provide assumptions for the theorems, and the conclusions of the theorems provide the desired solution.  Then the software, that is, the 'algorithm', implements the data manipulations specified by the math.  We take the math seriously because of the theorems and proofs.  Then we take the algorithm seriously because, and only because, we took the math seriously.<p>Net, without the math, there is little reason to take the algorithm seriously.  With the math, to evaluate the algorithm, we should evaluate the math and then confirm that the algorithm does what the math specifies.<p>So, for your<p>""Your knowledge of computer science is evidently shallow.  Educate yourself and you might think twice before making such ignorant pronouncements.""<p>What is relevant here is what I wrote; whether my ""knowledge of computer science"" is ""shallow"" or not is irrelevant.<p>I said nothing ""ignorant""; you gave no solution to the question of how to take an algorithm seriously when 'inspection' is not sufficient; and I gave apparently the only good solution we have.",1346688423

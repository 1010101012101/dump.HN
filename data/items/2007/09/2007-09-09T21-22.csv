Unless you're God himself, they probably wont sign anything (you are LUCKY to have them look at your venture).<p>If you have some process/idea that is really as significant as you say, and the barriers of entry to implement it are so low that anyone who simply hears about it could screw you, then you should apply for a patent.",1189371831

Good writing expresses ideas, and no one refers to their ideas as content. You'd never hear pg referring to his essays as content, which is probably why they're so popular.<p>It's actually kind of funny. You'd think there would be lots of intelligent people who had interesting ideas and wrote them down, but really there aren't. ",1189371634

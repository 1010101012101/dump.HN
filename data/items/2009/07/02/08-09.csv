By today's standards at least, it seems relatively straighforward.<p>I love how obviously human-generated the key is: ""13, 34, 57, 65, 22, 78, 49."" - the differences between the two digits are almost all 0, 1 or 2. As a species, we must really resent random numbers.",1246525188

The fact that entrepreneurs are overconfident may, in most instances, be to their detriment, but it also will engender great breakthroughs that have huge payoffs and make society much better. Without overconfidence, this wouldn't even be possible.",1246525157

I submitted a couple of my own pieces that I found really interesting and they just, well, died instantly :) And a recent off-hand analysis of modern cyber security brought in 1500 views...<p>One thing I do think is obiovus: unlike reddit and slashdot et all HN doesnt care if it is a self-submission. I avoid self-submitting elsewhere but deliberately take time to do so here. If it's not a popular article it will die quietly but no one will bitch about the factyou submitted it :)",1246525016

Your first attempts might not be very good but, soon, you will start producing good work.<p>It is also worth checking out design showcase sites for inspiration. www.webceme.com is my own personal favourite.<p>One of the biggest issues I had when I started trying to design websites was getting the color scheme right. I would suggest, to begin with, checking out the color schemes on other sites. There are also a lot of tools for generating nice color schemes on the web.

Yes your object store will make the application much easier to write initially.  But then what happens when you need reporting or worse, some feature that you never anticipated that requires a different view into the data.<p>That's not to say SQL is the end-all-be-all, but people are so quick to dismiss it, and I bet there is going to be <i>a lot</i> of pain felt as code based on simpler databases ages.",1246522662

684034,comment,683807,683992,0,0,dasil003,,,"Are you kidding?  I wouldn't say it's impossible, but ""no reason to think that techniques for performing more traditional sql-style queries on distributed data won't quickly surpass it"" is quite a stretch.  There's plenty of reason to believe that.  Mainly because of the number of databases and the sheer volume of thought put into RDBMS', both theoretical and practical.  Sure, when it comes to massive scalability there are dozens of promising new technologies that beat SQL databases, but they all make tradeoffs, there's just no way not too when you're talking about something as powerful as SQL.<p>I imagine there will be some great improvements that come out, but I think we're past the point of any major data store revolutions unless something fundamentally changes like quantum computing becomes a reality and we have to all basically start over.",1246522353

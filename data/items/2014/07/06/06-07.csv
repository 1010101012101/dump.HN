There are _very_ few $12 meals out there that meet all of those criteria (Chipotle is almost there, but they don&#x27;t deliver to my door in 15 mins).<p>So I see them competing because they&#x27;re focused on different things (and they&#x27;re doing it right, at least for me -- I order dinner from Sprig 2-3 nights a week and lunch from SpoonRocket 2-3 times a week).<p>Traditional fast food restaurants (Chipotle excluded) optimize on price, speed and taste (similarly), but those all come at the expense of nutrition, which (disappointingly) most people don&#x27;t seem to mind.

So in a sense, I identified the author&#x27;s plight with my own recent and current experiences.<p>One of the early lessons I learned is that designing functional versions of algorithms is a whole higher level of hard over and above implementing conventional versions. For me, getting to a functional or less imperative version is an iteration of an imperative preliminary design. There&#x27;s a stage at which it is easier not to get bogged down with data structures as values and instead let them be variables because it allows me to simplify the transition to the next state as (next-state). I don&#x27;t have to add additional parameters to every function and coordinate them between functions.<p>I think that it easy to lose site of the fact that functional programming is supposed to make our lives easier by making it easier to reason about our code. Jumping from imperative pseudo-code to an idiomatic functional implementation is not easier for me to reason about than from the pseudo-code to It&#x27;s direct implementation. And it&#x27;s easier to reason from a direct implementation to a more functional one after I&#x27;ve got a feel for the direct implementation.<p>Probably it&#x27;s an intellectual shortcoming on my part that functional implementations don&#x27;t come readily to me when looking at imperative pseudo-code.

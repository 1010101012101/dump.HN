After that you can grep through the output.<p>This is not like XORing data, or as some people have said ""everything occurs somewhere in the digits of pi"". The blockchain in no sense encodes all possible values, or a fraction thereof, the data is trivial to extract.<p>This is much more like, it's sitting on the webserver, but not indexed by google. It's actually even worse than that because you can still just grep through the blockchain and find what your interested in.<p>This may or may not be a problem for bitcoin, but I think it is legally problematic at the moment. This may move us toward a world where it's not illegal to store any particular data or even distribute it. The illegal act might be the viewing or ""distribution with intent"" or the data.

5636791,comment,5636338,5636338,18,0,grinich,,,"I wrote a pretty extensive post on Quora about how to build hardware products. Here's an excerpt...<p><i>Designing for mass manufacturing is essentially impossible to learn without actually building several products. The challenges of negotiating with suppliers, verifying components, orchestrating supply chain logistics, and maintaining quality standards will swiftly kill a cash-constrained startup. But there's good news: unless you're on the cutting edge of a specific technology (like Apple with displays or metalwork), the problems you encounter at scale have very likely been solved by others. So the task then becomes to find those individuals or companies and hire them quickly.</i><p><i>PCH International is probably the most well-known of these firms. They notably make Kindle, products for Jawbone, and all the accessories for those dudes in Cupertino. Because they often work with big players, they're able to leverage large contract manufactures' (CMs) quality standards and economies of scale for smaller production runs. Currently PCH is also aggressively going after hardware startups and recently launched PCH Accelerator, which is essentially a strategic investment group to fund partnerships with startups.</i><p><i>Another option is Dragon Innovation, who works with Pebble, Makerbot, Sifteo, Leap Motion, and others. They're based in Boston and have recently partnered with the brand-new hardware accelerator/investor BOLT. They're certainly less flashy than PCH, but still know how to deliver.</i><p><i>HAXLR8R (Shenzhen) and Lemnos Labs (San Francisco) are other startup ""accelerators""-- kind of like a hardware-flavor of YC. They seem to be more focused on the R&D stages (pre-Kickstarter) than production. For some personal anecdotes by others, see What startup incubators exist for hardware companies? [link]</i><p><i>One way to think about contract manufacturing in China is with the ""smile curve"" popularized by Acer in the early 90s. It's essentially a graph of a product's extractable value as a function from creation to sale. On the left is brand, high-level design (IxD, ID, PD) and any specialized R&D. In the middle you have component sourcing, supply chain management, manufacturing, assembly, and shipping. And then on the right you have distribution, retail sales, marketing, and partnerships.</i><p>... it goes on with more examples.

I disagree with it, but even more, I find it jarring to apply a faith-based approach to thinking about these things in lieu of a critical assessment one. As if it were sufficient to cut through all the tangle and uncertainty with, like, ""Daniel 11:3 'And a great king shall stand up ...'"" and think that was case and point.<p>What's more, it's hardly clear that you've got this proverb the right way around: It seems as likely that corrupt legislators create regulation to enrich them and their kind, as opposed to well-intentioned regulation leading to the corruption of legislators. I've cut out the middle - corrupt legislators creating corrupt legislation - which is what we actually have and also the sort of murk that doesn't lend itself to witticism.",1367388579

Stammer, is another one of the things associated with dry mouth.<p>One of the ways, to cut the stage fright short is the 'Standing Swing' where we instinctively move in hips in, hips out position, like kids reading out in class. Its a way to trick the body into thinking we are in the fecal position.<p>Secondly, stage fright can be overcome with that rare pause, where after finishing a paragraph, you take in a deep breath, amateurs rarely do it, and intend to carry on, as if they would miss the train.<p>Thirdly, the tempo matters a lot, often, people try to go faster then their normal speaking speed, to which they are not accustomed to, leading into a unneeded stress on the brain to connect, produce and understand faster, leading to a mental stamina drain.<p>A good way around the first time stage fright, written in books is the ""talk to your friend in the crowd"" technique. 
Always, you would find that kind soul in the crowd, looking dead into your eyes, and giving you a validation nod, each time you speak, very often, this is someone you have a good relationship with, a friend, family or admirer. Just look into his eyes, and start talking, forget the rest of the crowd, as he agrees to everything you say, you would find it easier to deliver your speech.<p>A side technique, that requires preparation is to keep the contents of your speech simple, and short. Don't use words you are not familiar with, use the words, you most often use, even if you have to be a bit repetitive, your first speech needs to do a good job, don't aspire to be JFK on your first shot.",1367388104

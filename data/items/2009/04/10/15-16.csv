I've heard a lot about design patterns, I read the Design Patterns book, I even wrote a 10-page paper about it. But for some reasons, I couldn't wrap my mind to understand what each pattern is and how they work. Now, with a specific problem at hand I was able to read and understand a lot of patterns, up until I found the one to my problem. This is how I found out I'm a reactive learner (I'm not sure if I'm using the right word).<p>I always know there's something inefficient about the way I learn. I'd sit in class not trying to learn anything when the professor talk about theorems and proofs. And then when he moves on to the examples, I would instantly get it. I found my mind more stimulated to learn if I know the concept is useful to a known practical problem. It seems that my brain deliberately procrastinates and defers learning new abstract concepts. But this mode of learning wastes a lot of time.<p>I'm just wondering what percentage of other hackers are like me? Is it nature or nurture? I'd say it's probably mostly nurture as I spent the earlier half of my life in an education system where students are practically spoon-fed. I'm always amazed at others' ability to instantly grasp abstract concepts. What can I do to be more active when learning new abstract concepts?",1239378849

Since then there have been several attempts to create an upgrade, known as ECMAScript 4. For example ActionScript 3 and Microsofts JScript.Net is actually based on an abandoned ECMAScript 4 proposal from around 2000-2003, a spec that way heavily influenced by Java. A new ECMAScript 4 effort started a few years ago with Brendan Eich as editor, which was more inspired by dynamic and functional languages.<p>However the new ECMAScript 4 spec was pretty large and ambitious, and some parts of the working groups called for a lesser, incremental spec release to fix some of the most needed fixes. This proposal was called ECMASCript 3.1. Then it was decided to scale the ambitious ECMAScript 4 spec back, and this scaled back version (which is still in flux) is called ECMAScript Harmony.<p>Now ECMAScript 3.1 has been released, but they have decided to give it the official name ECMAScript 5th edition, thereby leapfrogging the 4th edition! This might be because ""ECMAScript 4"" have gotten a bad name because of the several failed attempts. Also, it is obviously confusing when widely different specs gets the same name.<p>Harmony will then probably be 6th edition, and if some of the features from ES4 which was culled from Harmony appears in a later spec, it might be in 7th edition!",1239377032

We went from 0 platform experience and an idea to a simple but functional app (that grew like crazy, but unfortunately had only 2 weeks to sign up new members) in probably under 20 developer hours. Our following app (the one that is doing fairly well today) took something like 1 developer month to launch, though we've since put probably put 1 developer year into improving it, generalizing the engine and launching two new themes on top of it, as well as porting the whole thing to Myspace. We'll be releasing game #4 onto both networks this week.<p>We didn't have to worry about being accepted into any store. (Facebook has an app directory that takes a couple days to get reviewed for, but honestly there's very little benefit to even being in it.) After we launched, upgrading was as simple as any website. We didn't have to make some fairly hard to achieve top 25 list to get traffic, in fact, we're hoping for the reverse.<p>Developing for Facebook isn't that different than any other web development (in fact a lot of apps run in an iframe). It's far easier, and gives far less control to a third party. It's far more lucrative, doesn't have the ""hit or miss"" aspect of the app store.<p>You're right about the hosting cost. Only some iPhone apps need that, many do not. All Facebook/Myspace ones do. But the greater monetization potential more than makes up for it if you're doing games (I'm not so sure about other types of apps). eCPMs on offer pages are measured in the $100s. Many people I know (in a way that would be admissible in court) are pulling in north of $500. Even if that only amounts to 1% of your traffic, that's still ludicrously high, especially on the volume you can get very quickly.<p>The only way in which it is inferior is it isn't sexy and nobody is going to write lots of articles about you.

A lot are shot in picturesque places like Ocean Beach or the Presidio which are very far away from the map shown at the end. Even some of the relatively obscure places I recognized are not even close (there's a ""Trad'r Sam"" which is on Geary, way northwest of even the top left corner of their ""R"").<p>Edit: oh duh, I get it now. That's even part of the joke. <a href=""http://services.google.com/latitudevideo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://services.google.com/latitudevideo/</a>",1239376163

It's common knowledge to only use preg_match, etc. in PHP if you're performing a very complex search. Of course, this is not a huge deal, but I feel that if you're advising others to use such a simple piece of code, it should be as perfect as possible.",1239375822

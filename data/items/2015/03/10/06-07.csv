Just because i want to be a developer doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t want to study Calculus or linear algebra or differential equations or Accounting principles in college. (these were all courses in my CS degree). Even if we stick to CS, I don&#x27;t think one can truly cover everything in 2 years. I haven&#x27;t checked the curriculum of this program yet, but I&#x27;d like CS colleges to delve into subjects like data structures, automata, compiler construction, OS, Database internals (not just queries), Concurrent programming, etc. Yes, I may not need all of this to write a Web app, but these are things that I believe make a more well-rounded developer",1425970701

ReadWriteWeb was acquired by SAY Media for less than $5M and they cut it loose two years later. HuffPo wasn&#x27;t turning a profit for AOL in 2013, and Tim Armstrong wouldn&#x27;t say in Dec. 2014 if it was earning a profit, which basically means it&#x27;s not. In any case, HuffPo&#x27;s revenue is largely driven by rehashing the original reporting of other outlets, and that is definitely not sustainable journalism.<p>[0]<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/13/say-media-selling-off-readwrite-xojane/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/13/say-media-selling-off-readw...</a>\n[1]<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/aol-huffington-post-profit-2013-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/aol-huffington-post-profit-20...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/huffington-post-over-200m-revenue-says-tim-armstrong-2014-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/huffington-post-over-200m-rev...</a>",1425967526

Most California nut farmers have built their orchards over decades, and expect decades of future production from them.  If they don&#x27;t water the trees, they could die, and lose the entire farm.  If you have 30 years of future production (10s of millions of dollars in revenue) at risk, you&#x27;d take any measure necessary to protect that investment, regardless of the impact.",1425967200

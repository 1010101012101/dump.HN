OTA upgrade didn't work for me so I needed to resort to Samsung's Kies software which is amongst the worst software I have used and even with that I had troubles upgrading).<p>So I installed cyanogenmod 9.1 and I fell in love with my phone again. It's not perfect though but I don't think I'll ever want to buy a non-stock Android phone again...<p>So being a rather passionate Android guy I do recognize that there are very annoying problems with some Android devices. And installing cyanogenmod is way above the skill level of the average phone user (even though it's rather easy).<p>Sometimes I wonder if iPhone people experience the same kind of disappointments ... and when they do it makes me feel a little warm inside. I know it's not nice but I guess we all need to justify our own purchasing decisions to ourselves every now and then :)",1348153104

Really, I agree that this is not ideal for the average user but you, as an HN visitor, should not have much trouble performing such a minor step to get your functionality back (and Google's web app even has a few new features compared to the old native App)<p>There are good reasons for Apple to have their own mapping that will eventually lead to a better experience. Think about how many Apple apps already need some kind of geolocation (Find iPhone, Find Friends, location based reminders), there are lots of potential synergies there. It just takes a while to catch up on the half a decade of experience Google has had in doing it.",1348153065

I know I'm not the only programmer out there who is also a rock climber. Theo de Raadt is an avid outdoorsman, there are plenty of other HN users who climb, or bike, or run, or swim. Fitness is a frequent topic here. In fact, come to think of it, I'd bet that more HN users are healthier-than-normal instead of unhealthy.<p>Your body is something you can optimize just as effectively as anything else. It's as simple as ""eat better food, get more exercise"". None of that fad crap, just more fruits & vegetables, less junk food, and a walk around the block once a day at least.<p>And there are clear benefits to being healthy. For one thing, you're more likely to live longer, so if you've got some kind of life-long goal in mind, some project you want to accomplish before you die, then getting healthy now will buy you time to do that. You'll sleep better, you'll be more rested, you'll be more alert. If you're prone to anxiety or depression, exercise and good diet helps manage that.<p>Once you get started, it's easy to start meeting new people after a while. Social connections -- the real ones, not Twitter -- are an amazing resource for any freelancer or solo founder.<p>But if you convince yourself that being the way you are now is part of the ""culture"" that you want to immerse yourself in, then you're telling yourself a very pleasant lie, and you've effectively demotivated yourself from doing anything about your fitness.<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/scobleizer/6292840317/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/scobleizer/6292840317/</a> : how many of the people in these photos from Startup School look obese to you?",1348152741

There can be a lot of pressure to participate correctly in psychological experiments, I know that in my undergrad you had a requirement to do some amount of experiments to graduate (and non-psych students would be paid, which also puts pressure on you to do your role correctly). To say ""sorry, I wasted your time - I misread these questions"" would not be easy, much simpler to just make up new answers and leave.<p>I find it hard to accept their interpretation that attitudes actually reversed. Yes, some experiments - like Milgram's - show that people can do surprising things, that we would not expect in advance, and would even say ""I would never do that"", but likely we would. But this isn't the same - in Milgram's study, behavior was all that mattered. In this one, it is the interpretation of changing attitudes. I agree it is likely people will <i>voice</i> different attitudes, but I doubt it is because they actually changed them, instead it is either social pressure to not admit you failed at your task to read the questions and answer them honestly, and/or that the student doesn't care either way about the topic.",1348152004

What happens on Sputnik is you've deployed three [LXC containers](<a href=""http://lxc.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lxc.sourceforge.net/</a>), one for orchestration, one for your node app, and one for mongodb with Ubuntu server just like they would deploy on EC2. Then you iterate a few times, commit, deploy, test. After you've done this for a while, now you're ready to deploy in EC2:<p><pre><code>    juju deploy -eamazon node-app whatever-yourapp\n    juju deploy -eamazon mongodb\n    juju add-relation -eamazon mongodb myapp\n    juju expose -eamazon whatever-yourapp\n</code></pre>\nThen `juju status`, snag the public URL for your AWS instance, paste it into your browser, and you're deployed.<p>The nice thing there is you're doing all your app development locally on sputnik in containers that are pure Ubuntu Server, just like you'd get on AWS or HP Cloud, except now you're not running up a bill testing every little thing, you can replicate those kinds of deployments locally, which is nice when you're on a plane.<p>Sorry to sound like a commercial but Dell lent me a Sputnik to show this off at OSCON and it's really really nice to be able to just fire up deployments locally on a fast SSD and then push willy-nilly to the cloud, all right out of the box.",1348151567

I think ""Street View"" is Google Maps' killer feature and no amount of ""3D View"" is going to replace the ability to virtually drive your route (or see the storefront, the turn you need to make, etc.).<p>On the other hand, Google has a habit of releasing amazingly disruptive products (maps, gmail, etc.) and then the pace of innovation of each app slows dramatically. What was the last ""innovation"" gmail did? Priority inbox? Buying Sparrow?<p>I'm optimistic this is the start of an arms race in the mapping area (Apple: please tackle email next); this needed to occur sooner rather than later. We don't know the circumstances of the switch (it seems equally likely that Google precipitated the change as Apple did) but given Apple's knack for taking a MVP and continually, doggedly improving it, I think the future is bright for iOS Mapping.",1348150552

[...] Developers should be welcoming competition and with so many crap apps out there today it's probably better for good app developers to work on getting their rankings higher while the crap app makers languish at the end of the results.<p>Good comment, but I don't agree with this part.  This does very little to help ""good app developers"" or encourage competition.<p>The app store is very strongly biased towards the first few hits for a given search result. As a small to medium developer, if you're not in the top 5-10, depending on the keyword, you may as well not exist.  And that ranking depends first and foremost on your ability to drive downloads to your app, and a distant second on your app quality.<p>This change will make the bias that much stronger towards the first 1-3 apps.  They'll tend to stay there, while other apps will have that much harder a time to move up.<p>I LOVE that screenshots are more visible.  It's great for users, and it's great for quality apps. I have a great app currently ranking in the lower range of top 10 for my targeted keyword, and slowly moving up because - in my opinion at least - it's higher quality than the apps above. Great icon, great screenshots, app looks and behaves great. So you'd think I'd be ecstatic about this change.<p>Actually, I'm worried this change will stop my app dead in its tracks, and further consolidate the top 1-3 positions.

Well, it's easy enough to locate the <i>lowest</i> set bit in x -- it's x & -x, the same basic idea as the x&(x-1) trick -- but what the code above does is to locate the <i>highest</i> by ""filling"" rightwards from that bit. After the first line, the 1-bits in y are the 1-bits in x, and the bits one to the right of them. After the second, it's the 1-bits in x shifted right by 0..3 places. After the next, 0..7 places.

2809691,comment,2806935,2809038,1,0,nkassis,,,"I just don't believe most software patent fit the description of an algorithm. The real problem with them is they are patents for idea an not for implementation as an algorithm might be considered.<p>When Amazon patented A 1 click button. They were not talking about an algorithm, they were talking about the idea of having a button which purchases the object I want with 1 click. Implementation of this is wide, this patent tells me nothing of what the process behind the patent should be. If it did then you could get around it. That's the fundamental issue with those patents as you've pointed out. I can't figure out what is or isn't an implementation of this patent because no real useful implementation instruction was given.<p>On the other hand The Marching Cube algorithm patent does fit what you are talking about, the is instruction on how to implement the algorithm and those kind of patents have some issue for sure too. The claim against it was that it's a completely obvious way to solve the problem. There are alternatives to this algorithm such as the (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_Tetrahedrons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_Tetrahedrons</a>) which is just redoing the same thing another way, so it's at least better to me than the 1 click patent.<p>Software patents in general are wrong, I'm not arguing against that but saying all software patents do is patent algorithms is not strong enough an attack in my view. When people will look at it they will see putting multiple algorithms together to solve a problem in a non obvious way is in a way no different then putting a bunch of smaller components together to create a new device. I don't believe patenting either really helps promote innovation. (I'm pretty much anti all patents).",1311718227
2809690,comment,2808462,2808544,1,0,gus_massa,,,"It’s important to remember that these are not the way that physicists think about the Higgs boson. This is the way they try to explain it without any equation, and not using the words like ""Lie Group"" or ""Gauge invariant"".  The problem is that explain the Higgs bosons in an easy way is very difficult to. (It is like explaining one of the more obscure posts of Raymond Chen to someone that never had seen a computer.)<p>Last year I took a course about particle physics and we saw the equations of the standard model.<p>I like more the explanation that involves ""pencils"". I think that it is possible to expand the non-technical words and get something like the correct theory for Higgs bosons (for example: pencil->vector). In this explanation there are a lot of details missing of course, for example: Why the Z and W particles have different mass? How do the electrons get their mass? What is the difference between the waves that rotate the pencils and the waves that stretch the pencils? I think that these simplifications are sensible to get a short explanation.<p>I don’t like the explanation that uses viscous forces. The main problem is that with viscous forces the particles ""lost"" energy and the particles should become still. The real effect of the Higgs field is similar to the apparent effective mass of an object in a fluid. To accelerate the object it is necessary to accelerate some of the fluid that is around it, so it is more difficult and the object have a bigger apparent mass. This is unrelated to the viscosity and happens even when the fluid has no viscosity.<p>Another problem with this explanation is that the when the particles move they don’t drag any Higgs bosons (real or virtual). So the mental image is wrong. A possible way to see this is that as the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field is not zero, the particles can ""bounce"" against the vacuum and the result is something in the movement equation that looks like a mass. It sounds strange or even ridiculous, but in the problem is not in the equations, but in the ""translations"" to non-technical words.",1311718223

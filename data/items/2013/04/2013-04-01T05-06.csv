5471700,comment,5469623,5471610,5,0,derekp7,,,"For beginning programs, there are two classifications that I remember being taught way back when.  First, there were the class of problems that can be summed up by ""Write a program to generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers"".  These were all algorithmic / somewhat math based problems.  They usually came from classes that were sponsored by the Engineering side of the school.  The second classification can be summed up by ""You have two files, each containing a list of [data items].  Produce a program that generates a third list of [data items] [having a given characteristic]"".  These seamed to me to be more practical / instructive.<p>So as a marketing person, think of some types of reports you would like to see given some data that you have.  Remember that the input data should consist of a number of items (records or lines) that have consistent characteristics, somewhat like you would get from a spreadsheet.  Maybe you want to get a list of how many customers from each zip code bought a blue widget vs. a green widget.  So in this case you would write down a mock up of what your resulting report would look like, then figure out what manual steps you would do to get there.<p>When going through this exercise manually, pretend that you can't remember anything but your current thought, and that you have to write down everything else.  Each thing you write down on paper translates to a program variable.  Then, every time you have to change what is written down, make sure that is done via a repeatable list of steps.  That then translates into an algorithm, which directly translates into lines of code.<p>Most of the first programs I had to do in ""the real world"" consisted of simply taking data from multiple sources, and making reports that others in the business could analyze.  In some cases it was simple compound interest reports based on employee deposits/withdraws in a company savings account (kind of like an in-house mini credit union).  Other times it was something like an Inventory Turns report for our head of purchasing (a report of how many times each product would completely cycle in inventory in a given month).  These were all done on a Unix command line, using a combination of shell scripts, sort, join, uniq, and awk (this was well before perl came out).  Eventually this type of work became second nature (so i didn't have to think through the logic), and I was able to move on to more advanced programming.",1364795792

This rifle of course removes the skill element and allows for shooting at an extremely long range.""<p>... in such a way as to suggest that the increased possibility for menace is so enhanced that it is irresponsible, nay, indefensible, for this to be available.<p>I was pointing out the fallacy of that line of reasoning.

5471685,comment,5468467,5468467,10,0,unlogic,,,"Lein-droid author here. A few commenters asked about the performance and maturity of Clojure for Android, so I decided to answer in the top level.<p>The main problem of Clojure for Android right now is the large size of Clojure runtime. This leads to two issues:
a) long loading time (can take a few seconds even for the basic app),
b) applications often gets closed by the OS once switched to another, in order to free that memory.<p>Since ProGuard is no help in optimizing Clojure-compiled code, the issues should be addressed in some other way. One that is possible is to write source-shaking compiler that will strip the final APK of the unused functions. It's pretty hard to do with the current compiler, but if we eventually write Clojure-in-Clojure compiler (there is a proposal for this year's GSoC by the way), it may be feasible to add these optimizations to it.<p>And finally a shameless plug: if you are interested in trying Clojure for Android, here are the links to get you started:

You say ""<i>even</i> every day items"".  It makes <i>less</i> sense to ban every day items than it does to ban extravagant items that very few people, if any, need or even want.

5471581,comment,5466872,5468368,1,0,graue,,,"A day later I looked at this again and I'm a little closer to understanding.<p><pre><code>      var listPromise = new Promise();
</code></pre>
creates an object that, being a Promise object, has certain methods and internal state, derived from the prototype of Promise.<p><pre><code>      for (var k in listPromise) promises[k] = listPromise[k];
</code></pre>
This confused me because I thought ""k"" was a stand-in for a numeric index, e.g. that it was doing promises[0] = listPromise[0], promises[1] = listPromise[1], etc. That is not what's going on. Rather, ""k"" refers to attributes and/or methods that objects of the Promise class have by default. It's copying those onto `promises`  the array `promises` itself, not the individual items `promises[i]`, which keep their existing methods and attributes.<p>Coming from a Python background, I think I would have found this more obvious if the variable ""k"" were instead called ""method"" or ""attr"". If it was `for (var method in listPromise)` it'd be much clearer what's going on, whereas single-letter variables like i, j, and k are, to me, stand-ins for integers.<p>It was also confusing, as you said, that the function uses destructive update rather than treating the input as a value. James did mention this (""augmenting the list with promise methods""), but it's still unexpected, especially when the function is preceded by a Haskell type 
signature.<p>The reason I only say I'm closer to understanding, and not quite there yet, is I'm not sure what it means to do `new Promise()` or what is being copied over in the above for-loop. I tried James's code with a Promises/A+ implementation, rsvp.js (<a href=""https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js</a>), but it won't let me do `new Promise()` because it works differently:<p><pre><code>    > var promise = new RSVP.Promise();
    TypeError: You must pass a resolver function as the sole argument to the promise constructor
</code></pre>
Per an example in RSVP.js's readme, it's expecting this:<p><pre><code>    var promise = new RSVP.Promise(function(resolve, reject){
        // set up a callback that calls either resolve(...)
        // or reject(...)

I don't know of (probably due to ignorance, because I haven't looked for) another country that has done the same.",1364793462

It's painful and frustrating<p>I get what he is saying but I disagree, in that I think that coding is actually <i>succeeding</i> to get something working by any means necessary, even if you don't quite understand why.  Be it getting your first web site up and running, getting your first program compiled, fixing your first bug, etc.  There are a lot of hurdles and roadblocks you will face, especially when you are starting out, it will seem that every single piece of information is just out of your reach, like Tantalus and the grapes. It takes a lot of patience and perseverance to get through most programming problems, but that feeling of satisfaction of getting past these roadblocks is amazing.  I still get that feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment, even though I'm 20+ years into my programming career.<p>The followup to that is that you look back at your code 6 months later, cringe, and then rewrite it to something that is an order of magnitude better.",1364793290

5471573,comment,5471131,5471494,5,0,bmelton,,,"I'm not the author, but I'll recap some of the points I've made all over this thread.<p>1) Where you claim it makes a more effective killing machine, another might easily say that it makes a much safer hunting weapon, or more easy to use for wounded, injured, disabled or handicapped hunters or veterans.<p>2) There are many, many ways that criminals could exploit even every day items to achieve extremely deadly results, and until we're ready to ban every single one of them (which admittedly, Mayor Bloomberg seems poised to do), we should not punish the majority for the very unlikely potential criminal use by a very small minority.<p>3) It's an advancement in technology that I worry may be stifled for private industry and instead hoarded for military application, which will almost certainly lead to slower development in the technology.  Imagine further into the future, as the technology evolves, it might be able to distinguish between humans and potential prey.  Or even perform sentiment analysis on humans to differentiate between humans at peace and humans that are actively trying to kill you.<p>Also, for the record, I'm not suggesting that being afraid of the potential for technology such as this is completely unreasonable, but I am arguing that in this country, at least for now, we do have a Bill of Rights that protects our right to bear arms and this, such as it is, classifies as such, and should not be bannable on the meritless assumption that every would-be shooter will now plunk down $17,000 and become a super-villain just because they can.",1364793155

1166175,comment,1165916,1165916,0,0,ghshephard,,,"This isn't really a spat - and the issue with what Dell charge for gear that goes into their servers has been around for at least ten years.  For about a 3 year period, (1998-2001) any Dell Server I ordered would always come with the minimum amount of memory, and we would always purchase the actual memory from Crucial.  Everyone I knew who Bought Dell servers did that, even if they were ""Not Warranteed"" - Dell certainly never confirmed that the Memory in the System was Dell Memory, and they never had a tech blanch at fixing another broken component.<p>Eventually, Dell was losing enough of their memory business to Crucial that they brought the price back down to market rates.  The current pricing distortion (if it exists, I don't really price SSDs in Dell Servers) - will likewise be temporary as people purchase second-market SSDs to put in their Servers and stop buying Dell SSDs.<p>What I don't understand, after having read the article three or four times, is what the actual ""Spat"" is - is Dell suggesting that if people put Amazon.com Intel SSDs into their systems that there will be a problem with the warranty, _and_ they are actually following through and refusing service when they discover non-Dell drives in their servers?

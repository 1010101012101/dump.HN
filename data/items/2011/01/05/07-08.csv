This allows for queries to built in a way that are DB agnostic.  Also makes it very easy for other to modify them.<p>* A generic entity system.  In practice this allows data fields to be attached to objects dynamically.  A cool thing about this system is that field storage is completely configurable on a per field basis so you could have your data stored in a bunch of different system (Mongo, Cassandra, S3, etc.)<p>* There is a really nice URL routing system.  Drupal 6 had some really irritating problems, but there is a lot of cool stuff in here now.<p>* jQuery UI has been integrated so it's available for use on every Drupal 7 installation.<p>There are a lot of other things too.

It is lightweight and fast, just that one has to click a lot. So, it feels 1997, when GUIs were a ittle more responsive.  (I do really wish the WM would do some more things for me, like SloppyFocus) ...and don't ask about the file manager.<p>As far as boot speed goes, on my laptop it's a couple of seconds.  I'd use it more if not for the below-mentioned issues.  (Booting from a disk; the live CD is as slow as you might expect.)<p>The software support is not bad at all.  There's a nice browser (webkit-based), bash, and I didn't have trouble getting a couple of mainstream interpreters running.  I believe they're using a slightly older gcc, but I had no trouble getting a couple of my personal projects to build (rsync'd from somewhere or copied from my /home, since Haiku can mount ext3), or a few other programs that I wanted.  If something is POSIXy, it'll probably run.  Ruby and Python worked for me, as well as a small language I'd put together.<p>The only thing that keeps me from running it as the main OS for my laptop is drivers.  The wireless support is still in development, and the version I have doesn't know when I've plugged in my headphones; my laptop is mostly used to play music, ssh to a larger computer, and browse the web.  So, without headphones, I would definitely disturb coworkers, and need an ethernet cable to use besides.<p>Still I recommend trying it out.  It's still under development, but it's solid and fast already.  (Just need the danged sound/wifi drivers to work...)",1294213662

I generally think of it like this:<p>10 = Sam's Learn Java in 24 hours<p>100 = did some programming courses at highschool / university<p>1000 = baseline professional programmer. Has already understood the\n                basics of writing reasonable code at the function level<p>10000 = experienced programmer - will stand out in a corporate \n                environment, probably the minimum that you want working \n                 on a startup. Understands architectural issues and mastering \n                the environment outside the application<p>100000 = star programmer. That said, I don't see a big difference \n                  between the last two categories in terms of pure programming \n                 skills. The difference is more in that the 100000 LOC \n                 programmer is capable of directing a team, explaining the \n                 system architecture to others, making the code more \n                 modularisable and accessible to others (doing the necessary \n                 makefile magic so that code will compile as C or C++ for \n                 example, or providing a plugin architecture, or adding bindings \n                 for a scripting language etc)<p>To go back to the original question, if you find that you are limited to 1000 LOC programs, looking at the list, you need to look a bit more at architectural issues - encapsulation, OO, functional style programming, that sort of stuff, to get you to a level where your code won't descend into an unholy mess when it starts getting bigger.<p>I actually use the size of codebases written entirely by the candidate as an indicator in job interviews - it gives a good feeling of where the person is at.",1294213592

2070248,comment,2070112,2070112,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Filtering ""fake or deceitful reviews"" is a complicated task to accomplish. While you won't find the exact solution, you can research how companies like Yelp and AngiesList have done it.<p>There are many factors in the formula, but a lot of it revolves around looking at who the user is exactly. By looking at how often they contribute, how long they have been a member of the site, and incorporating a rating system into the review (helpful/not helpful) you can begin to determine which are the best reviewers.<p>Verifying the user is real is another step you can take. You can do this by adding a verification step into the account creation process (i.e. responding to a email) prior to submitting a review. Setting default time limits to how long the account has to be active before they can make a review also can work (this avoids the random user in the heat of the moment writing a false review or one that is not fully thought out). If your users have ""profiles"" in the system, similar to Yelp, you can give more credibility to a user who takes the time to fill out their profile info.<p>Another method is to track IP addresses and compare to where the place of business being reviewed is. Although this will not work in all cases (i.e. someone traveling or logging in from home for a vacation experience), it does lend some credibility.<p>By giving each method you incorporate into your system a weight, you can then add the weights up to come up a validity indicator. Each method could be weighted on a scale of 1 to 10 and the higher the weight awarded for that method the more credible. You then have to weight the methods in general. In the end the formula combines all those weights together to get a total weight which should give you an idea of how credible the review is.",1294212100

2070242,comment,2069281,2069990,0,0,wtallis,,,"Wow, that's a sad list. It looks like they didn't even port half of the server components to the Itanium, and they warn you not to use .NET for anything performance-sensitive. The closest thing they've got to a modern, portable environment and their first port of it is so embarrassingly slow that they have to warn you on the feature list. Even worse, their modern GUI APIs (WPF) weren't ported at all, so even simple .NET apps are at risk of not working due to not using an archaic GUI toolkit.<p>Clearly the NT kernel is quite portable. There's plenty of evidence of that (MIPS, PPC, Alpha, IA-64... ). But there's no evidence that even the most modern and supposedly portable components of the desktop experience are actually at all portable. Hardly any of it has (as far as we know) actually been ported.",1294211776

2070231,comment,2069272,2069352,0,0,hyuen,,,"While SSDs are wonderful for random reads, writes are still very expensive due to their large erase blocks. In a small write (typical OLTP workload), the entire block has to be rewritten --typically 128kB-- even if the modified data is much smaller. That's why it is very important to make the application aware of this fact, or use a log-structured filesystem on top of it.<p>I believe that for most web applications the ratio is 80% reads, 20% writes, that's why no one has noticed this behavior.<p>Another even more concerning issue is the wear-out, SSD cells can't take more than ~10000 rewrites. While there is firmware taking care of invalidating those blocks, eventually we can expect data loss if not backed up properly.<p>I think SSDs are great, as long as we understand their limits...

It's reasonable to believe in a vacuum that a newly-released ""SimCity"" game will be the same.<p>Lots of people are in such a vacuum -- a LOT of people hear ""A new SimCity game is coming out / has come out"" in their periphery and, having enjoyed its past iterations, rush to buy the new copy. Their surprise in finding that it's an entirely online experience is reasonable here.<p>Calling it ""SimCity Online"" could have dampened this effect, causing some -- if not a lot -- of people to stop and think ""Wait, what makes it Online?

Your kids or your peer's kids though will play games this way because it is the only way to get them and they will think its 'normal.' Eventually you'll be called an 'old timer' and derided for all your comments about how in your day when you bought a game it didn't need to download 4GB of 'patches' nor did it require Internet access to run.<p>What is most curious though, is whether or not this new world order is stable long term. Other creative works publishers like movie studios or musicians, can capture the long tail of revenue for their products long after the initial 'rush' but for game studios and other 'active' products there is this continual draw on the host companies resources to keep servers alive or what not. So eventually keeping a game 'alive' starts generating negative money. And killing a game generates negative customer sentiment. So the combination might overwhelm the business model.<p>Only time will tell.",1362776213

The core reason this is a problem is that higher gaps in income in a society are correlated (not necessarily causal, but they frequently appear) with social instability.<p>As voters, we currently want more America than we've proven willing to pay for. This means one of 2 things must happen.<p>1. We pay more for the America we have<p>2. We get less America than we want<p>""less"" in this case could mean really obvious things like less services or benefits of certain types. It could also mean less of intangibles/unquantifiables such as social stability, or opportunity etc, which are hard to value until they're not there (I've spent much of my life in seriously unstable places in the world, and I can attest that little else works when you dont have the basics). Most likely, we'll have to pay a little more, accept a little less, and as OP suggests, buy slightly different things with what we're paying.

5345679,comment,5344987,5344987,3,0,dakinsloss,,,"The post is overall good but it misses one huge question and seems to implicitly assume something that is incorrect.<p>I agree growth is good, but shouldn't we then ask what causes growth or halts it? The post does not explore this, but Sam seems to assume that growth is caused by government investment in infrastructure, science and technology. This is false. What are real concrete examples of this abstract idea 'economic growth'. Many of the best examples are actually due to individuals acknowledged in the post such as Peter Thiel and Paul graham. Growth comes from individuals like these choosing to invest in entrepreneurs (at various stages) based on their judgment. Those investors who judge right enough accumulate more capital to reinvest and continue encouraging growth as long as their judgment about what should grow is good enough.<p>Sam seems to suggest that growth is achieved through government investment. I disagree. Every dollar the government spends comes from a Peter, a Paul or an Elon. Who is going to do a better job investing and causing growth? Elon or a government bureaucrat. Elon is one of those rare entrepreneurs who has plowed into areas of deep regulation such as space travel and transportation. Imagine if the government wasn't financing roads with money taken from those accumulating capital, then how much easier would it be for Elon to disrupt transportation and grow that industry through innovation? How many more entrepreneurs would be willing to work in that industry?<p>Each of the most broken and stagnant industries are most touched by government: education, healthcare, defense, finance, transport, and energy. Growth has happened in software/tech because government is far away meaning it is easier to work on problems free of intervention and more people are willing to. Growth has stagnated in these other areas because government has disincentivized entry (and often teamed with established inneffectivr big cos) by getting involved, regulating, giving away for free, and generally making it difficult to impossible for entrepreneurs to enter and thus undesirable.<p>So what has caused growth? Individual investors and entrepreneurs exercising good judgment. What has slowed it? Government regulation as government has grown its tendrils into more and more areas. What should we do to promote growth? Shrink government leaving investors their money to invest and opening more industries for potential private investment that won't have to face burdensome regulation or competition against public entities that don't try to profit.",1362775807

Then there was BrainTree and open-sourced libraries like ActiveMerchant. This made billing for your own app and some marketplace options easier. We do 3rd party payment aggregation with NextProof (www.nextproof.com) and I still get an email every week from someone who read an HN post I wrote 2+ years ago. But after the financial crisis, most merchant underwriters frowned upon payment aggregation.<p>Then all the billing/charging services came along. Recurly, Chargify, Spreedly, CheddarGetter, etc. These made billing and charging your own customers easier. They never really handled ""products"" but I think they paved the way a bit by showing that having easy APIs <i>is important</i>.<p>Now you have services like Stripe. So, you can do recurring billing and individual charges. You can let your customers setup their own accounts (via Stripe Connect) but still keep the business logic in your app. This also takes care of the disbursements/payout issue and puts the onus of chargebacks on the user. The API is easy. PCI compliance is not as much of a problem. Transaction fees are in line with PayPal (but our BrainTree fees are lower). You can build a tool like this, a marketplace like Etsy, a crowdfunding site, etc. ... If you look through Stripe posts on HN, the biggest gripe is always international payments. I built www.bngal.com because it was easy and fun.<p>It will be interesting to see what's next ... possibly integration with in-person payment systems (like Square) or maybe cardless payments (linked to bank account?).",1362775301

5345593,comment,5344987,5344987,18,0,nhashem,,,"<i>We have, in startup parlance, a high burn, and most of it cant be considered investment but is instead expense.  Spending money on things like infrastructure improvement or new technology that are likely to generate more money in the future helps growth; spending money on the so-called entitlement programs, and parts of the military, does not.  Of course medical care and defense are important, and we have to have themthis is a tough balancing act.  In some cases, the competitive nature of the private sector may provide a better path.  Sooner or later, we are going to have an ugly conversation about our national budgetwe can delay it for a long time but not forever.  The government, when it needs to spend money at all, should aim to invest.</i><p>If you have a high burn, you either have insufficient revenue or excessive costs.  I have gotten <i>so frustrated</i> the past four years at the demagoguery of the national debt as a result of excessive costs.<p>These are the data points I want to point to every time someone suggests our national debt is ""unsustainable"":<p>- In 2000, the federal government collected tax receipts of 20% of GDP[0].  From 2009-2012, these tax receipts were around 15% of GDP.  This is due to, as you'd imagine, the huge private sector deleveraging that happened in 2008 and the fact that, politically, any suggestion at raising taxes gets you called a Kenyan Muslim Communist.  Yet we didn't seem to have a problem with growth when taxes collected were much higher than they were now, as a percentage of the economy.<p>- 2/3 of our federal budget is spent on Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, and defense.  Any issues with Social Security being considered unsustainable is that only $113,000 of payroll is eligible for taxation.  It would seem to me that  if you made all payroll eligible for taxation, you would only be impacting those well into the upper-middle class, and would ensure solvency for at least 75 years.  Legislation to do so was recently proposed by some Democrats in the Senate[1].<p>- We spend a lot on Medicare because we spend a lot on healthcare.  We spend a lot on healthcare because we are the only first-world country in the world that doesn't put a ceiling on how much health care providers (hospitals and drug companies) can charge, even for basic services.  Yet those that have good insurance are completely price-unconscious.  We essentially have the worst of both worlds -- not enough free market forces for health providers to price competitively, and yet not enough price controls either.  If you have a free 30 minutes, I highly recommend anyone read Steven Brill's recent writeup in TIME magazine[2].<p>- <i>It is a complete fallacy</i> that we're living longer, so therefore we have to jack up the age of eligibility of programs like Social Security and Medicare.  Most gains in expected life expectancy over the past several decades are due to reducing infant mortality -- in other words, the only change is that we have less people that died before they could even pay anything into SS.  Furthermore, most life expectancy gains are concentrated on the wealthy -- those that don't even need Medicare.  The life expectancy for working-class Americans is actually <i>shrinking.</i>[3].  I'm not really sure why we need to cut government benefits for janitors because lawyers are living longer.  Paul Krugman is constantly trying to explain this on his blog[4].<p>- If you want GDP growth after a recession caused by massive private sector deleveraging, Keynesian government budgets are exactly what you want.  Beyond stimulating spending when everyone is clinging on to whatever money they have because they're living paycheck to paycheck, with US treasury interest rates under 2% for years, this is the perfect time for our government to run deficits at cheap interest rates.<p>The OP says ""Borrowing money to get ninety growth cents on the dollar does not count, although that may work for a while.""  But in current conditions mean we'd be getting <i>much more</i> than ninety growth cents on each deficit dollar.  Conversely, cutting each deficit dollar results in <i>much less</i> growth than one dollar.  This is known as the ""fiscal multiplier,"" and there is a lot of research showing that in depressed economic conditions, the multiplier is much higher than 1.0.  The utter economic clusterfuck in Europe is because too many people in controlling the Euro felt the way the OP does, so you have countries like Greece and Spain cutting their budgets to eliminate deficits, yet resulting in such a harsh economic contraction that their budgets end up with even <i>bigger deficits.</i>[5].<p>- We obviously have a shitload of waste in the federal government.  You can't have a $3 trillion budget and not have some dumb stuff in there.  But for the purposes of any macro fiscal impact in terms of GDP or unemployment, it's literally <i>irrelevant.</i>  After Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid, you're left with $1.3T in the budget, over half of which is military spending[6].  Yeah, we have too many military bases and we probably have some useless bureaucrats in the Department of Transportation.  But for the most part this spending is on core government programs that are helpful and that people like, which is why the only specifics Mitt Romney could give on what programs he would actually cut was Big Bird.  I'm sure you could cut $100 billion with nobody really caring, and we should obviously strive to have the least wasteful government possible, but are a few wasteful programs the reason why democracy is going to unravel?<p>- In the early 1990s, it was legitimate to argue the federal deficit was crowding out private sector growth.  Deficit spending required the Federal Reserve to keep borrowing rates high to fend of inflation, which meant it was more expensive to borrow money for any sort of investment.  As George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton passed tax increases in 1990 and 1993 to balance the budget, the Federal Reserve was able to lower interest rates in lockstep, thus preventing any fiscal contraction.  In other words, counterbalancing public spending with looser monetary policy can be a good receipt for stimulating growth[7].<p>However, the Federal Reserve rates have been at zero for <i>years</i> now, because the recession of 2008 pales in comparison to 1991.  If you make money as cheap as possible the private sector continues to say ""meh, I think I'll just hoard profits"" and you don't have any inflation even with absurdly cheap money, then there are no more bullets in the monetary policy gun left, but bless Ben Bernanke for still trying (QE, Operation Twist, etc).<p>Yeah, yeah, ""OMG HYPERINFLATION WEIMAR ZIMBABWE!""  The same people have been yelling this for years.  Wake me up when the Bureau of Labor statistics reports a CPI inflation over 3%[8].<p>- 2% growth isn't great, but it's not going to cause democracy to unravel.  It may cause democracy to unravel when 99% of the wealth generated by that modest growth is concentrated in 1% of the population, however[9].<p>In conclusion: in principle, there's nothing really too controversial about what the OP is saying.  We should absolutely be talking about the ways to grow the US economic pie so that our political process doesn't keep grinding to stalemates over who gets what of the pie we already have.<p>Our government isn't perfect.  It could do a lot to improve a lot of things to encourage growth, and many of them aren't even fiscal in nature (e.g. patent reform).  But if you're just going to point to the national budget, echo popular political talk-show points about ""$16 TRILLION IN DEBT OUR GRANDKIDS WILL HAVE TO PAY"" and ""WE'RE ON THE ROAD TO GREECE"" then I'd argue you're <i>completely</i> missing the forest for the trees.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=200"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Doc...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://vtdigger.org/2013/03/07/sanders-reid-defazio-introduce-legislation-to-strengthen-social-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vtdigger.org/2013/03/07/sanders-reid-defazio-introduc...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/print/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medica...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/us/life-expectancy-for-less-educated-whites-in-us-is-shrinking.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/us/life-expectancy-for-les...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/the-life-expectancy-zombie/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/the-life-expecta...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp1301.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp1301.pdf</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/BS_Discretionary_print.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/...</a><p>[7]<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/08/06/what-we-can-learn-from-clintons-1993-tax-hike/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/08/06/w...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUSR0000SA0?output_view=pct_1mth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUSR0000SA0?output_view=pct_1...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/03/news/economy/record-corporate-profits/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/03/news/economy/record-corporat...</a>",1362774902

It's the first Android device I've used that this was the case. My iPhone 4 was sluggish by comparison. I feel like iOS is getting slower while Android has been getting faster - at least on the phones.<p>* It's so much cheaper. $30/mo for tmobile pre-paid, no contract and unlimited data (though only 5GB/mo at high speeds).<p>* Lots of apps I used existed on the other side, and were as good or almost as good. Notably Gmail is better on the iPhone and Reeder still beats anything I've found on Android so far.<p>* I enjoy the bigger screen and find myself reading more on the phone than I did with the iPhone, but even with big hands it's some work to manage one handed use.<p>* The average quality of apps is pretty poor. So far I've managed to find nice ones for everything I wanted.<p>* Lots of things work in Android how they should work. The intents system is great.<p>All in all, I'm quite pleased. I don't think I'm ready to give up the iPad for a Nexus 7 or 10 yet, but it no longer seems like I'd be losing all that much even there.<p>UPDATED to add:<p>* The keyboard is just way better. I can type so much faster, and the result is that I'll actually use it to write emails now, instead of just waiting until I'm back at my desk. Some of this is due to increased size, but some is due to the keyboard software being that much better. For example, spelling correction is <i>way</i> better on Android. Just tap and choose after you've written everything else.<p>* Cut and paste is sort of frustrating on Android. One example: try to copy the url from the Firefox address bar. I've managed to do it, but it took a few minutes of trying various things.",1362774323

It's worth noting that plane autopilots are not at the door-to-door level that we're talking about with autonomous cars.  Also, Pilots are much better trained than drivers, so there's less impetus to get them away from the controls.  Sooner or later, though, planes will be flown completely by wire.  When it's demonstrable that autonomous planes fly better than real pilots gate-to-gate, that will become legally enforced.<p><i>Anyway, the question is who is liable</i><p>In this sub-thread, I was just addressing the previous poster who said that he would never own an autonomous vehicle.<p>Just to throw my two cents in... in all likelihood, Google will need to demonstrate that their vehicles are more safe than ""normal drivers"".  When you buy a Google car, you will need to buy auto insurance that covers an autonomous vehicle.  Depending upon actuarial tables, that insurance will be more or less than your current insurance.  Google's liability would likely only extend to extreme defects in the AI and/or death-causing defects that are systemic and can be shown to be the result of negligence or not disclosed to customers.<p><i>politics and power rather than right and wrong</i><p>I object to the immediate contention that you or anyone else really knows what's right or wrong at this point.  Your statement above ""to shift liability to the owners of the cars"" gives away where you think liability lies.  I don't think that's at all clear.  If Google creates all the cars from here on out and deaths on the highway are cut in half... does that mean that they're liable for the deaths that still occur?  That number of deaths would have occurred anyway.  Google did nothing wrong, they actually saved tens of thousands of lives.  So what's that worth?  Suing them out of existence for the deaths they didn't prevent?<p>In order to book those lives saved, we'll all need to pay for our own insurance for most accidents.",1362773782

This might've significantly increased the app ecosystem for Nokia phones, which might have made more people buy the phones. A lot of people (and very much not just the geeks) <i>do</i> care that their favourite apps are supported <i>and decent</i> on a particular handset.<p>I never understood why they didn't do this. At the time when many developers were still a bit nervous about learning Objective-C just to support one single platform, a good, company-supported Qt-for-all-phones could've made Qt the leading app toolkit <i>by far</i>.

If you invest through Seedrs, you get shares in the business with full upside (and downside). If you contribute through Kickstarter, you get whatever product or other reward the company is offering (no upside or downside). Both great businesses but very different.<p>Difference between Seedrs and AngelList: Seedrs is a transactional platform where people make direct investments; AngelList is a source of introductions, after which you go and do an investment off-line. Also, Seedrs is focused on idea-stage, pre-revenues companies and open to a wide group of investors; most deals closed following AngelList intros are at the next stage (because that's generally where traditional angels invest) and only involve accredited/HNW investors. Again, both great but different.<p>As for whether there is a Seedrs equivalent for the US: not yet but there will be lots soon. As of now equity crowdfunding is not legal in the U.S., but as soon as the SEC and FINRA implement regulations under the JOBS Act, it will be, and loads of platforms are lining up to do exactly the sort of thing Seedrs does in the UK.<p>Hope that's helpful!<p>Jeff Lynn\n(CEO and co-founder of Seedrs)",1344543352

But i like to play games, so i had a windows dual boot, and a Wii. But Windows requires way too much maintainace. And dual booting is annoying: i am an impatient guy.<p>So i got an XBox. Because consoles are hassle free, right? Boy, was i suprised. The interface (metro) is horrible with a controller. Voice commands are not available in Holland either (not even in English). The thing boots slower than every other device in my house. Xbox live is flaky, and the thing has daily updates.<p>It was the worst user interface experience in my life. Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe the name itself should have tipped me off (this is aimed at 16 year olds with too much time, that like to tinker).<p>Maybe Apple sand Google spoiled me, with iOS and Android, proving that a device could be simple, with low maintainance. Maybe i expected just a faster Wii.<p>Or maybe, Microsoft is just very very incompetent.<p>Maybe the PS3 is better, i would not know. The general consensus seems to be that xbox live is better than psn, but its hard to imagine, just how bad the ps3 would have to be. But seriously, how can anyone bring such a confusing pile of horseshit to the market. Its beyond my comprehension.<p>In the end, it was just a slower booting windows, with a worse controller, and more updates, bullshit dialogs, and bugs.<p>I hate the thing. It was the biggest purchasing mistake in my life. Oh, and kinect does not work. Not that i care about that much, but its a complete deception.",1344543195

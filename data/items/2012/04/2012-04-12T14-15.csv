3832574,comment,3827881,3830204,3,0,ckpwong,,,"I learned my multiplication table in Chinese (mother tongue), which was way easier when every line has the exact number of syllables (4), almost like a poem.  I believe I was taught at school in grade 1 or 2 back then, but I (and most other people) had it memorized at an earlier age.  It's easy enough to ""teach"" my 3-year-old just by reciting it in front of him.<p>Memorizing multiplication table in English is a lot less intuitive, which I attribute to many people's disdain (or pure hatred, depending on whom you ask) of it.<p>I'm all for teaching a man to fish, but if he's starving at this moment, save him now by giving him the fish fish first before teaching.  A dead man doesn't do much learning.<p>As for my son, he hasn't learned the multiplication table yet, but he's always interested to have us repeat it to him.    (Ah, the curious minds of 3-year-olds.)  In a few years, once he has learned the <i>concept</i> of multiplication, it'll be easier for him to <i>apply</i> it for the rest of his life if he has the table memorized.  Before that time comes, the table is nothing but nursery rhyme to him.  And that's fine with me.",1334242748

3832536,comment,3830211,3832319,1,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"> The only way to make sure the general populace vote = ruling party is to have an American style two party system<p>I offer as counterexamples all the industrialized liberal democracies with various forms of proportional representation, in which the composition of the government actually does reflect the general populace vote. They may not be countries in which a single party forms the government, but there's no reason a single party has to form the government, particularly if no party receives more than 50% support among electors.<p>I have a lot of respect for the parliamentary system, in which voters elect the House of Commons, the House appoints a Prime Minister, the Prime Minister appoints a Cabinet, the PM and Cabinet are accountable to the House. I appreciate that this system has historically included parties, or formal associations among members of the House of Commons to vote more or less along party lines.<p>However, the parliamentary system also has a long tradition of coalitions among parties, and even of governments being formed by parties that did not win a majority of seats. The basic unit of legitimacy for a parliamentary government is that <i>the government enjoys the confidence of the House</i>.<p>I was really frustrated during the 2008-2009 constitutional crisis over the widespread public ignorance over how the parliamentary system works. It's frighteningly clear that most Canadians don't understand their own government, which makes the system a ripe target for abuse. Since the 1970s, Canadian ruling parties have steadily concentrated power more narrowly in the PMO, to the point that Canadians have forgotten that they vote for the House, not for the Government.<p>As a result, governments have increasingly snubbed their nose at the House of Commons - to the extent that the Harper government actually deployed a handbook for disrupting and marginalizing parliamentary committees and absolutely refused to share budget numbers with MPs, triggering an election over their Contempt of Parliament.<p>During the constitutional crisis, and following the lead of the Conservative Party, far too many Canadians argued with straight faces that a government appointed by a coalition of parties representing more than half the seats in the House and more than half the votes cast would be somehow anti-democratic, while an appointed government that refused to face a confidence vote - the most fundamental litmus test of legitimacy in a parliamentary system - was somehow upholding democracy.<p>We can no longer afford a system in which a single party with a minority of votes can enjoy a majority of seats and more-or-less absolute power to pass legislation during its term in control of the government. You write, ""all parties gravitate to the political centre if they want success"", but the current government is busy passing one-sided ideological legislation - like the omnibus crime bill and the new copyright bill - that most Canadians oppose.<p>If they held seats proportional to their popular support, they would have to cooperate with another party to achieve majority support in the House and we would see more balanced legislation.",1334242293

As innovation in technology has accelerated, the level of education required to either create new opportunities or to retrain for existing ones has increased.  It is possible that successful automation will eventually outpace the ability of the masses to retrain and adapt.  Meanwhile the cost of traditional education continues to rise disproportionate to the rest of the economy, although we are seeing some other possible avenues open up on that front.

If this sort of thing exists under the hood, revealed only by a detailed analysis of the specification, what other nonsense is there? Going so far as analyzing a string to determine whether it consists entirely of numbers for the non-sequitur process of then and only then converting it to what it isn't for logical evaluation is working pretty hard to do something counter-intuitive; might be tolerable if it actually preserved all digits, but not only does it work hard to convert a string to an integer, it then converts large integers in to floating-point values - not just one, but <i>two</i> layers of explicitly undesired and unnecessary and unreasonable typecasting.<p>I'm currently working with barcodes: numerical strings from 6 to 55 digits. In no way can I risk having one barcode be evaluated as equal to a literally different barcode just because the symbols in that string just happen to exhibit a passing resemblance to data of a different type.<p>Again, it's not just that it has loose typing. It's that it's taking what is OBVIOUSLY a string, converting it to an integer, THEN converting it to yet another data type which imposes data loss.<p>Intolerable for real-world use. A toy language.

And had a little clap of delight to see my suspicions were correct.<p>However, don't you think the reason for the success of Maxwell is because the objects it describes are well behaved and can be completely described by a set of partial differential equations? Where as the constituent atoms (hehe) of software are themselves complex objects - more than just point particles whose state can be completely described by say a wave function. And their behvior effectively solvable by simple deduction from physical postulates and the axioms of mathematics. I believe I saw a story about Feynman deriving a bunch of partial differential equations to predict the behavior of a program. But I do not think such an approach is scalable.<p>But the core of your idea I believe is that by specifying invariant in some theory which encapsulates the possible evolution of all possible programs then you can write programs far more simply? Essentially the next level of a synthesis of programming with unit tests, data and automatic programming. I believe the main impedance to this (I think) is that any such general evolution function would be incomputable. And where as with Maxwell equations the space is limited and the boundaries defined and embodied and easily deductively traversed, for a program the search space would be massive and difficult to search effectively. In effect, I believe you have just specified an AI complete problem.<p>Notice also that even a classical theory like general relativity yields few analytic solutions and numerical simulations are expensive. Perhaps this hints at why a unified theory is so difficult to come by? While the constituents are still simple particulates, the size of a theory/program which encompasses in totality all possible behaviors in nature might require a chain of reasoning so deep it lies beyond the ken of unaugmented humans. I believe a unified theory of efficiently searchable programs would be even more difficult - such a theory would yield a unified theory of nature as a special case.",1334240646

(Not a huge issue, but there are still a lot of apps with non-Retina graphics.)<p>- Interactive elements (page transitions, glow/shadow/gradient effects, animations) can be very, very slow. There are ways around most of the speed issues - using hardware-accelerated CSS, detecting touch events instead of click events - but it can be hairy.<p>- Fixing bugs is rough. PhoneGap doesn't dump Javascript errors to log like a web browser does, so you'll have to deal with your app randomly not responding for no apparent reason and spending an hour hunting until you find that one typo or missing semicolon.<p>But, the upsides:<p>- Getting from point A to a working prototype takes significantly less time.<p>- Porting to other platforms, while tricky if your app relies heavily on native hooks, is significantly easier than completely rewriting.<p>- Personal opinion, but HTML + CSS + Javascript is just a nicer environment to develop with.<p>- Every new iOS release comes with new features that make developing web apps a lot easier. iOS 5 brought native-style inertial scrolling to overflow: scroll, true fixed elements with position: fixed (though fixed elements still have some quirks), for example.<p>I'd highly recommend giving it a shot. You can be up and running with a working HTML/CSS/JS app in the iPhone Simulator in like 10 minutes. Hard to argue with that.",1334240280

>"" If I dont typically make a kind of mistake (like setting the wrong variables in a constructor), I dont test for it.""<p>My primary objection to TDD is that it doesn't seem to work, because when I've tried it, the tests caught no bugs at all. I believe that tests can be important for APIs to prevent regressions when you have to work with external components, but its frustrating to put time into tests and then never have the tests fail.<p>Its not that I'm a perfect programmer, its the kind of bugs I make.  The kind of bugs I make are caught by the compiler.  This may be because, over the years of my career (many of which occurred long before the idea of ""test first"" was widely heard) I've trained myself in a style of programming where I can trust the compiler to catch my mistakes (most of which are typos, frankly.)<p>I don't know if others can do this, but for me, it came about by doing things like:<p>Old way:
if (variable == 1) then whatever
New way: 
if (1 == variable) then whatever<p>Every time I mistype that as ""(1 = variable) the compiler catches it because I can't redefine 1.",1334239237

The apps that I did with PhoneGap have only been deployed to iOS so there hasn't been a lot of benefit in developing with PhoneGap. I'd say development time was roughly 1:1. If those apps get deployed to other platforms, then it's a huge win.<p>To get the experience I wanted on PhoneGap I've benefitted from being able to work natively. And I've also needed to develop functionality that didn't exist as plugins, which being able to jump to obj-c helped with too.",1334239227

83744,comment,83538,83538,0,0,Shooter,,,"I HATE the ""CPM and a prayer"" mindset that masquerades as a business model.  I don't understand why anyone starting a business these days would rely exclusively on ad monetization for their business.  I personally would never invest time or money in any startup that had ad sales as the only source of revenue (and I've invested in magazines, fergoodnessakes!)   <p>I believe in MULTIPLE revenue streams.  Most of my startups have charged directly for the product or service, but the most successful have all had multiple revenue streams.  A startup I'm working on now, for example, has six distinct revenue streams...and there are probably others we haven't figured out yet.  One of the revenue streams is advertising, but we deal directly with the advertisers (no ad network or agency taking a cut), there is a minimum $50K ad buy (reducing time/communications overhead), we have no dedicated ad sales staff (just 'order takers' and ad screeners) and it is our smallest source of revenue by a significant margin.<p>There are too many opportunities out there to rely on the whims of the ad market.",1196117335
83743,comment,83538,83538,0,0,optimal,,,"Nice topic--I'd really enjoy seeing more discussion of this kind here.<p>>>why, oh why are we all chasing the same ad biz model?<p>I think this may be--at least partially--a case of ""get rich quick"" versus ""get (sort of) rich slow.""<p>I believe if you follow the pay model you go your own way and forget about VC and GYM money, at least until you're successful enough for others to notice. This may never happen, however. I used to work for a guy who was probably one of the first ASPs in existence, only it likely never even crossed his mind because he's a businessman and not a techie. I'll bet he's barely even known in his niche, but he owns a successful business with about five employees and just keeps on adding customers.",1196117199

83732,comment,83715,83724,0,0,Tichy,,,"Thanks for the link! caps.fool.com looks very similar to sharewise, and therefore probably has the same flaws (if they are really flaws). <p>And even tracking real trades might be open to abuse - trade a small amount on the tracked system, and then a large amount on some other system? At least I can see some incentive for participating, though: perhaps you are more likely to attract followers to your trades, which in turn increases the value of the stock. <p>At this point I am not planning a real startup (as obviously I don't have the right idea yet). I was contemplating to experiment a little together with friends, though.",1196115188

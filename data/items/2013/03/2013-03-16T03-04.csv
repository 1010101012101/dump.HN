5384371,comment,5384202,5384202,0,0,atx,,,"Here's what EA really means by 'straight answers'<p><pre><code>  I hate to disturb you when youre playing SimCity, but Id like to offer
  some straight answers on the topic: Always-Connected and why SimCity is not
  an offline experience.
</code></pre>
We're super pretentious!<p><pre><code>  Always-Connected is a big change from SimCities of the past.  It didnt
  come down as an order from corporate and it isnt a clandestine strategy to
  control players.  Its fundamental to the vision we had for this SimCity.
  From the ground up, we designed this game with multiplayer in mind 
  using new technology to realize a vision of players connected in regions to
  create a SimCity that captured the dynamism of the world we live in; a
  global, ever-changing, social world. 
</code></pre>
Which not many SimCity fans actually care about! Of course it didn't come down from corporate, it came from General Managers like you! That isn't corporate...no!<p><pre><code>  We put a ton of effort into making our simulation and graphics engines more
  detailed than ever and to give players lively and responsive cities. We
  also made innovative use of servers to move aspects of the simulation into
  the cloud to support region play and social features. Here.s just a few:
</code></pre>
Let me just insert arbitrary features we had 'envisioned' and reinforce the idea that this isn't DRM right here.<p><pre><code>  Cloud-based saves and easy access from any computer are another advantage
  of our connected features. You can pop from work to home, play the game and
  have your cities available to you anywhere.
</code></pre>
Guess what, Lucy? Steam Cloud provides the exact same thing and not all of them involve DRM. -shock-<p><pre><code>  Almost all of our players play with connected cities. But some chose to
  play alone . running the cities themselves.   But whether they play solo or
  multiplayer, they are drawn to the connected city experience. And
  Always-Connected provides a platform for future social features that will
  play out over regions and servers.
</code></pre>
Let me be pretty clear about what SimCity was and always has been. The basement dweller's dream of creating the life and the feel that they were never able to partake in. Social? You're out of your brains...<p><pre><code>  The game we launched is only the beginning for us  its not final
  and it never will be.  In many ways, we built an MMO.
</code></pre>
No. No you did not. You marketed it as a once off game to buy and play. MMO's have a very distinct feel about when they're released. They have alpha and beta releases, news releases all up until 'official' launch date. You had an official launch date. You failed. This is not an MMO. Please don't try to spin the wording.<p><pre><code>  So, could we have built a subset offline mode?  Yes.  But we rejected that
  idea because it didn't fit with our vision.  We did not focus on the
  'single city in isolation' that we have delivered in past SimCities.  We
  recognize that there are fans - people who love the original SimCity - who
  want that.  But we.re also hearing from thousands of people who are playing
  across regions, trading, communicating and loving the Always-Connected
  functionality.   The SimCity we delivered captures the magic of its
  heritage but catches up with ever-improving technology.
</code></pre>
Really? Where have you heard these reports from? Please, do tell.<p><pre><code>  So I'll finish with another HUGE thanks to everyone who stuck with us
  through this launch.  Hundreds of thousands are building and sharing cities
  online now.  And what you.re creating just blows us away.  SimCity is a
  special game, with a very special community of players, and we're proud to
  be a part of it.

'Please be kindly understanding in our most insincere apologies as we give out some lame excuses and reiterate that this was all part of the plan.'<p>And as one commenter said on the article:<p><pre><code>  With all due respect, to write an article about why the new SimCity has to
  be always online and not to mention DRM or the anti-piracy measure even
  once, is dishonest and down right disrespectful.</code></pre>",1363406364

Likewise, there's a school of legal philosophy - a minority one to be sure, but present nonetheless - that <i>Marbury v.

SimCity is an iteration on a previously offline design, with no marketing or design data shared with those looking to buy the game to indicate that it's an entirely different game (to justify online-only) than the previous SimCity games. There's also a big difference between a game where all of the computation takes place on the gameservers and a game where you simply replicate your state up to the server.

Consider an example from last week's news; US agents captured Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, a former Al Qaeda spokesman, and have brought him to New York to stand trial. Some politicians are incensed, saying that it willmake NY a terrorist target and that he doesn't deserve a criminal trial, and demanded that the fellow instead be sent off to Guantanamo bay and interrogated, with his fate to be decided by a military court (summarized here: <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-09/opinions/37579171_1_qaeda-al-qaeda-sulaiman-abu-ghaith"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-09/opinions/37579...</a> FWIW I agree with the conclusion of this editorial).<p>You might remember that Obama attempted to close down the detention facilities in Guantanamo soon after taking office, and wanted to try alleged 9-11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammad in NYC, but the plan was shelved following vociferous objections, public demonstrations etc. Now I don't want to go all partisan, but I can't help observing that the very same Tea Party type Republicans that object to big government were the very same people that rallied in the streets of NY to argue against transparency and the application of the criminal justice system. For the administration, it's kind of a 'heads you win, tails I love' situation.<p>Part of the problem is that civil libertarians are not very organized. They don't march on TSA headquarters to demand the right to leave their shoes on, or parade through the streets of NY to champion the criminal justice system, or picket the headquarters of the NSA.

7782023,comment,7774764,7775342,1,0,hollerith,,,"Huh?  I consider Marin County&#x27;s buses vastly superior to SF&#x27;s.  I am really confused by your statement!<p>With the exception of one route (the 35 serving the Canal Area, which has very heavy passenger loads), if I show up at a bus stop in Marin County 5 minutes before the time indicated in the schedule and wait for 10 minutes, the probability that the bus will fail to come some time in those 10 minutes is less than 1 percent. On non-rainy days, the probability goes down to about 0.2 percent.<p>In contrast, when I lived in SF in the late 80s and early 90s, the probability was about 50% (and higher than that in the Mission District). There was no sense in consulting the timetable: the best strategy was to go to a bus stop that has buses that go where I want and wait an indeterminate amount of time.  Sometimes it would take 3 hours for a bus to come, then 3 or 4 buses would show up in a 3-minute interval.  This during non-commute hour when the (useless) official timetable has the buses coming at regular intervals.<p>Marin County resident since 1995; car-less most of that time.<p>When the traffic along a route is uncongested, Marin Transit buses will wait at some stops so as to avoid leaving any stop before the time printed in the schedule. Most of these waits are only a few minutes.  Are these waits at bus stops what you refer to with your &quot;you could walk faster&quot;?  Well, if so, it still seems to me like the best way to do it, since the bus&#x27;s not going as fast as it could at times of less traffic congestion than usual is made up for by the rider&#x27;s having to wait less time at the stop. And except for the ones on Route 35 and Route 17 (the ones without upholstered seats, that is) the buses are much more  comfortable than Muni&#x27;s buses.",1400731163
7782022,comment,7781311,7781311,1,0,zmmmmm,,,"The problems for Australian startups are cultural more than anything, I feel. There&#x27;s such a strong off-the-shelf culture here that it is near impossible for a small player to get local traction even with a demonstrably better product. Sadly IT is seen by parties on all sides - government, business, consumer - as something Australians are just not very good at and should be left to others. This is a bit of a catch-22, the attitude is justified by the lack of really big, high profile Australian IT companies doing anything useful. If a few companies had big exits (as Atlassian may do soon) then local investors might start to take an interest in funding early stage startups. But it is really more about attitude and culture more than anything and that is so deeply rooted (tall poppy syndrome, etc) that I don&#x27;t think much can change it and startups with genuinely innovative ideas are far, far better just to move to the US and get started there.",1400731149

You&#x27;re not going to do much better than gasoline and air as long as you stick to the chemical realm.<p>However, there&#x27;s still plenty of room for improvement within that limit. In particular:<p>1. The best batteries are still quite a bit below the energy density of gasoline+oxygen.<p>2. Creating batteries that can use stuff in the air the way gas engines do can let you &quot;cheat&quot; the energy density numbers.<p>3. There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of room for improvements to how much batteries cost for any given capacity.<p>4. Similarly, there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvements in battery longevity, in terms of how many charge cycles it can handle before it loses capacity.<p>5. Again similarly, there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement in charging speed.<p>I think 3-5 are key. Energy per mass or energy per volume is good enough for many applications now. It&#x27;s not enough for airplanes yet, but as Tesla has shown, it&#x27;s good enough for practical cars. The battery pack in a Model S is pretty heavy, but the fact that the rest of the drivetrain is so compact compensates a lot. The result is still heavier than a normal car, but not excessively so. The real limitations for electric cars are high cost (which is why the Tesla costs $70,000 and up, and cheaper electric cars have terrible range), battery replacement after some years of use (really just another dimension of cost), and slow charging speeds (meaning you have to wait 30 minutes or more for a charge, which is fine for normal city driving when you charge at home overnight, but troublesome for people who can&#x27;t charge at home, or who are on a road trip).<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any fundamental physical limitations at play in <i>those</i> areas yet, and at this point they&#x27;re probably more important than raw energy density.",1400731141

Lackey did sign agreements with ZeniMax, and as far as I can tell Oculus didn&#x27;t refute that point. Are those agreements moot, in your eyes? What if it were the other way around, with a large company like Facebook or Google taking the IP of a smaller company?</i><p>Several people have now questioned whether I think contracts should be freely broken or ignored, so just to be clear: no.  An agreement is an agreement.  I honor all my agreements, which is why I&#x27;m careful to read every single line of whatever I sign and think about every sentence.  Trying to decipher the double meaning in most standard agreements is fraught with danger though, because if you misunderstand a single sentence then you&#x27;re on the hook for the rest of your life.  That&#x27;s why I think we, as a community of developers, should be holding employers more accountable for their disingenuous behavior of trying to assert ownership of someone&#x27;s personal projects simply for being on a payroll or just for participating in a company event. Quick example: recently a friend of mine wanted to give me a tour of their office and meet some of the folks working there, but in the lobby of their building they demanded I sign an NDA just to come in and say hello. I declined, because even though there&#x27;s <i>probably</i> no risk to me in signing that NDA, there&#x27;s no possible way it could benefit me, either.  Why would a company expect a multi-year agreement just to walk in the door for a little while?<p>As far as Zenimax vs Palmer, well, the only reason Zenimax has a case is because Palmer signed that NDA.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Palmer only signed it because he got careless and figured it was just a Non-<i>Disclosure</i> Agreement (i.e. &quot;don&#x27;t talk about this stuff with anyone you&#x27;re not supposed to&quot;) rather than a transfer of ownership, as it turned out to be.  The central theme throughout all of this is that the employer is trying to extract as much value as possible at the expense of the people they build their business on.<p>So the question isn&#x27;t whether Zenimax have a case; obviously they do.  Personally, I find Zenimax&#x27;s actions amusing.  This lawsuit is such an obvious tactical blunder that it&#x27;s hard not to find it a little funny.  It&#x27;s not everyday that you see someone tank their company&#x27;s future prospects by pissing off their core audience and community while torpedoing any future chance they might&#x27;ve had to hire top talent.  Now everybody knows it&#x27;s a terrible idea to go work for Zenimax.  Surely it&#x27;s obvious how this throwaway comment from an Id employee might impinge upon their future prospects of hiring top talent.  And the only reason the throwaway comment was posted was due to the greedy lawsuit.<p>It&#x27;s rather karmic to see this entity, who is trying to step in and take credit for a movement that they contributed virtually nothing to, get such swift reprisals.<p>Indeed, it&#x27;s of course within Zenimax&#x27;s rights to sue in this case and try to recover perceived damages.  They&#x27;re free to exercise their right to sue.  And top talent is free to exercise their good sense to work elsewhere.  One wonders if Zenimax doesn&#x27;t see it coming, or doesn&#x27;t care.  Maybe they&#x27;re just so out of touch with gamedev culture that they honestly don&#x27;t see how this might impact their future prospects to convince top people to relocate their families to work for them.  It&#x27;s a bit comedic.",1400729708

7781965,comment,7781584,7781795,4,0,momerath,,,"The use of Doom3 in the Kickstarter (I remember feeling like Carmack had given his seal of approval), definitely provides Zenimax with ammo, and I agree, it could be ugly.<p>Like so many other (game) programmers, Carmack is a hero of mine, and the bias runs deep.  In reading the complaint, though, I was starting to feel for Zenimax, but when the &quot;$500 worth of optics&quot; phrase started appearing, they lost me.  The kit, as described in the thread where Carmack and Palmer first interacted in public, was to be a display, display-controller, and some sort of ski-goggle based contraption you could put together.  And, iirc, $300 was the price discussed.<p>But I think the really key point, missing from this complaint, is that, before Carmack (and Abrash at Valve) improved on the Rift, it had stirred up interest because of the concept of using simple, _cheap_, optics, that would allow the display to be closer to the eyes (wide FOV), and pre-correcting for the resulting distortion in software.<p>Carmack and Abrash provided some secret sauce that I&#x27;m sure will be vital to the sense of presence that will drive broad appeal, but the breakthrough was saying &quot;so what if the optics massively distort the image; we&#x27;ll fix it in software&quot;.

7781958,comment,7781311,7781607,6,0,quink,,,"Disclaimer: I work in the library industry, with public libraries. Fund public libraries. Fund the hell out of them.<p>As we&#x27;re moving towards the future, the disparity between those who have grown up alongside x, y or z technology and those who haven&#x27;t grows wider and wider. Four hundred years ago it didn&#x27;t much matter one bit if you knew everything your father knew and nothing much beyond that. A hundred years ago it didn&#x27;t much matter whether you had your public education and then no education after that.<p>With this government determined to raise the retirement age to 70, there&#x27;s going to be a huge imperative for re-education of sorts. And there is hardly a more suitable place one can think of this than public libraries. Maybe, to a certain extent, Khan Academy, maybe TAFE. But there&#x27;s just such an enormous gap between what these facilities can do over a public library it&#x27;s incredible.<p>While Google may well answer your question, what Google isn&#x27;t going to teach you is what questions to ask it. It won&#x27;t ever do that. The facilities and sessions and materials that a public library makes available to one in an ontologically intuitive and relevant defined hierarchy - How do I use the Google - that&#x27;s important.<p>When you have the 55-year-old bricklayer with a back that&#x27;s shot and not much support to speak of from his family, that&#x27;s someone who can make a valuable contribution to society. And retraining at some TAFE is going to be one part of the equation, sure. But it&#x27;s far from everything.<p>Frankly, this concerns me probably even more than the startup scene in Australia.<p>You embellish an ingrained primal desire, deep within every damn person in this country to want to know more and if they don&#x27;t know run out and get the tools to know how to learn more, and this whole startup stuff solves itself.<p>You&#x27;re from a left-wing party... &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot;. There&#x27;s an inherent principle in Marxism that says let people do what they enjoy creating. As we&#x27;ve seen manufacturing disappear overseas and the cost-effective exhaustion of our resources drawing to a close, what else do we have left but an information economy.<p>You make &#x27;from each according to his ability&#x27;, some mythical spirit of mateship towards helping each other out and creating a better place a more overriding priority in the consciousness of whatever shit is on the front page of The Daily Telegraph, then you&#x27;ll be closer towards that light on the hill. You have an election platform that somehow subverts that 45-year-old with no programming knowledge into going on Github and creating his thing - even if there&#x27;s not a line of code per se to be seen in what he does - and we may end up with a better place all around.<p>And, yes, the NBN too. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen, on reddit or Delimiter or wherever, me rambling about this before. I&#x27;ve just complained with a work mate about how, over distances of even 1600 km a carrier pigeon with a MicroSD card would beat the coalition&#x27;s even more exhaustive supposed rumoured upload promises. Half of our customers are in Europe and with us, even within Australia, having half our staff telecommute the upload speeds are a pain in the butt. Seriously. The average upload speed in Russia is 22 Mbps. The best connection any of us have is 2 Mbps, some are on 300 kbps and less.<p>Sorry for rambling, especially in such an abstract preachy way. It&#x27;s just that I, and I think pretty much everyone else, has had it up to here with the state of politics in Australia these past few years.<p>In all honesty, start-ups per se are the last thing the federal level of government should really be worried about. Because all you guys are going to do is throw money at some project about IT sales software for hair salons and some primitive system about keeping track of sheared sheep with barcodes or something.<p>Also: Immigration. Europe managed to open up near enough all internal borders and I&#x27;m not seeing much chaos. Sure, it&#x27;s not going to make much sense to open up our borders to China or whatnot. But just allow people from Schengen to come to Australia, no questions asked. Restrict social security payments until a stay period of 5 or 10 years.

Also, Australia is a more attractive location for people from Commonwealth countries since there is far less of a culture shock.<p>If you have any more questions about these programs, or just about my experiences in this regard, email me at [my username]@gmail.com.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cic.gc.ca/ENGLISH/immigrate/business/start-up/eligibility.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cic.gc.ca/ENGLISH/immigrate/business/start-up/eli...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-10/canada-tells-geeks-to-flee-silicon-valley-head-north.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-10/canada-tells-geeks-...</a>",1400728001

   chicken shit little faggot cocksucker&quot;

   Brown stated &quot;when I say [RS&#x27;s] life is over,
   I don&#x27;t say I&#x27;m going to kill him, but I am
   going to ruin his life and look into his fucking
   kids&quot;

   Brown stated &quot;I&quot;m armed, that I come from a military
   family, that I was taught to shoot by a Vietnam Vet
   and by my father a master hunter ... I will shoot
   all of them and kill them if they come&quot;
</code></pre>
Sorry. Those are hardly the words of an objective &quot;journalist&quot;. Law enforcement generally frowns upon threats of personal violence against them and against their children. Like it or not, this is settled law. You don&#x27;t get a free pass about this stuff.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8932468"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8932468</a>",1421971161

This covers dates that happened between January 1st 2014 and December 30th 2014. I also went on a bunch of second dates, a handful of third dates, a smattering of fourth dates, and some past that.<p>> The purpose of this analysis is to understand how to predict whether or not I’ll be compatible with someone based on his profile and the messages that he sends.<p>One of the best online dating studies was published in Psychological Science in the Public Interest[1].<p>Its basic conclusion: online dating is great because it expands one&#x27;s access to potential partners but the algorithms don&#x27;t really work and the profile-based structure creates an &quot;assessment mindset&quot; that leads individuals to be more picky, judgmental and non-committal.

Thinking about it a bit more, I think my definitions fit closer with the idea of concurrent or parallel <i>programs</i> rather than the abstract ideas of concurrency or parallelism themselves.<p>In any case, I completely disagree with your idea that parallel systems must be concurrent. Concurrency arises completely due to the interactions between separate threads of execution, whether they be executing at the same time on separate processors, or scheduled one after the other on a single processor. This is why we have various process calculii (csp, pi-calculus etc), and things such as session types, in order to try and reason about it and manage it. Parallelism assumes nothing about the interactions between processes, only that they are assumed to be running on separate hardware.<p>As another poster mentioned, this fits fairly well with what the Haskell, Go, and general programming language research community considers to be the definitions of concurrency and parallelism. Look at any paper that focusses on concurrency, and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s about managing and making safe communication between separate processes. Look at a paper on parallelism, and it&#x27;ll be on accelerating a parallelisable program on multicore or distributed hardware.",1421968830

8932387,comment,8930825,8932344,0,0,WestCoastJustin,,,"Thanks for the kind words ;)<p>> <i>How long does it take to write and produce each episode?</i><p>Rough guide is about ~2-3 hours per minute of video. Research, playing around with ideas, demos, writing, recording video, recording audio, editing, etc. So, ZFS part one was 12 min, that&#x27;s about 24 hours, and part two is 18 min, so about 36 hours. Those two episodes are about 60+ hours of solid work. ZFS did take a little longer than 60 though, since I ended up doing tons of research, but I rather error on a better quality video, than putting out sub optimal content. These figures are shocking to many people, but I have honestly not found a quicker way. As I learn to use the editing software a little more, I have been able to shave an hour here and there, so that is nice!<p>> <i>Would you care to share the toolchain being used for screencasts?</i><p>Sure, here is a basic dump of the tools I use:<p><pre><code>  Ubuntu (deskop)
  Kazam (desktop recording)
  Audacity (audio recording)
  Kdenlive (edit the audio/video together)
  Screenkey (keystrokes on screen)
  Decrypt (intro screen)
  OpenOffice Writer (transcripts)
  Shaky (ascii diagram to png file)
  Asciiflow (diagram tool input for shaky)
  Gimp (graphics)</code></pre>",1421968079

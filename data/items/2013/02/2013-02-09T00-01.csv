Your effort is neither a service nor labor done one anyone else's behalf; it's a speculative capital investment, and your risk to bear.  If I spend millions of dollars developing a new type of camera film in 2000, and digital cameras make film cameras obsolete before I earn a penny of revenue, that's too bad, but no one owes me anything.  Spent a billion bucks building new houses in 2008?  Sorry to hear it, but you don't get to tear down other people's houses to restore the value of yours.<p>And if you say that copying is different from anything else that might diminish your return because you think you already had some inherent right to control whether other people make their own replicas of your stuff, then you're begging the question; your lack of ROI can't itself be the justification for copyright if you make such an argument.",1360371591

Just check their executive pay levels and acquisition patterns, which you should do anyways. You don't need to make a probabilistic argument when you have direct evidence.<p>Meanwhile, in many instances shareholders tend to be capricious and uninterested in long term health, especially when particular shareholders are heavyweights but in unrelated markets (e.g. hedgefunds under plurality voting charters)<p>edit: also what jmillikin said, which is particularly apt since the study you cite did not claim those results as more likely in dual-class companies, but found them correlated with the <i>growth</i> of the divergence between insider voting rights and cash-flow rights.",1360371453
5191041,comment,5189790,5190733,6,0,btilly,,,"I agree.<p>I would say that people who have not spent a lot of time playing with math are not going to have developed the kind of intuition that will let them understand the subject, or see how to apply it to novel problems. Also there is a dearth of math material aimed at people who don't already have a strong math background.  Therefore people who you find who can handle math usually also have a background in proofs.<p>But it is perfectly possible to explain useful and subtle math points to people who can think well, even though they may lack math background.  However as I've found writing articles like <a href=""http://elem.com/~btilly/ab-testing-multiple-looks/part1-rigorous.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elem.com/~btilly/ab-testing-multiple-looks/part1-rigo...</a>, it is deceptively harder to do than I'd have thought.

5191029,comment,5189808,5189808,26,0,T-hawk,,,"This article doesn't go at all into the details of why NES Tetris is unwinnable and doomed to fail.  Let me plug that gap.<p>The brick wall limitation comes at level 29, after 290 lines.  At that time, the pieces drop so fast that they cannot reach the sides of the well before locking into place.  The code rate-limits sideways moves of a piece to about 250 ms intervals, so if the game is running fast enough that the piece reaches bottom in less than a second, it's impossible to translate the piece five columns over to the edge.  It's not a human limitation; it's literally impossible to keep playing even going frame-by-frame on an emulator.  To go beyond 290 lines (or 293 if the 290th was the first of a Tetris), you'd have to stack up pieces on the sides ahead of time, and the absolute limit is about 310.<p>Modern Tetris games are very carefully designed to avoid such limitations.  Modern Tetris games always allow at least a half second after a piece lands before locking it, allowing further moves and rotations.  <a href=""http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline</a><p>So the game of NES Tetris becomes not how long you can survive, but how many points per line you can score in that fixed duration of 290 lines.  If every single line of the 290 was a Tetris, the total would come to about 1,500,000.  So to reach the game's score cap of 999,999, about two-thirds of your lines must be achieved as Tetrises.<p>Gameboy Tetris has no such impassable speed tier.  You can play Gameboy Tetris forever and many players have scored 400+ lines and 999,999 there.",1360371095

This would be like creating a new cosmology department at a university that stands at the nexus of astronomy and astrology.</i><p>Okay, you go to the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT and tell them that they are all quacks. But if you ask me, it's you who are the quack, not they.<p><i>> If this were true in medicine, doctors would have to stop offering treatments. But the absence of science has had no effect on psychologists</i><p>You act as if medicine has always had the scientific foundations that it now has. It's been getting more an more scientific over time, and it still has a long way to go. Psychology is currently at the state medicine was 100 years ago. And that is simply because it's a more difficult field to study scientifically. We didn't even have the conceptual frameworks to study it scientifically until computer science and artificial intelligence were invented. This is why Behaviorism was such a bust. It attempted to study psychology scientifically, but the prerequisite conceptual frameworks did not yet exist.<p>Btw, how are you going to rationalize the fact that primary care physicians routinely hand out antidepressants for depression, a disorder identified and classified by psychology?<p><i>> If doctors offered the kinds of treatments that psychologists offer, on the basis they offer them, they would be arrested.</i><p>Nonsense. The most common psychological treatment is just talk therapy, which has been proven effective, at least for treating depression. In the worst case, it's harmless and acts as a decent placebo. (Which is a real effect, of course.)<p><i>> It's not credible to say that psychology is (a) a science but (b) has nothing to offer clinicians. One, or the other. Not both.</i><p>Clearly logic escapes you. Cognitive psychology is a science. This is indisputable. It hasn't developed to the point where it offers much clinical advice. It does offer some, but mostly for mnemonic techniques for those who are suffering from cognitive impairments.<p><i>> If psychology wants to be regarded as a science, let them craft testable theories that define the field,</i><p>That's what cognitive psychology is doing. See previous discussion on paradigm shifts.<p><i>> Such theories would place psychology on a par with real sciences, each of which is defined by central, testable, falsifiable theories</i><p>Cognitive psychology is full of them.<p><i>> Each of these theories is a clear statement that unites its field.</i><p>I don't think you've ever studied chemistry. Organic chemistry is as much about all the exceptions, as it is about the rules. It's as sloppy as science can get. And necessarily so, because chemistry is a useful but problematic simplification of the underlying physics. No one even understands why or how lithium ion batteries even work. And yet we use them every day. How unscientific! (And that's not even organic chemistry.)<p><i>> Psychologists can and do offer treatments that aren't vetted by research. The reason? Psychology is not guided by science.<p>Clinical psychology may not be guided so much by science. That's a far cry from claiming that cognitive psychology is not science.<p></i>> As a first step, expel clinical psychology from the field.<p>Psychology is not a single field. Some subfields of psychology are scientific. E.g., cognitive psychology. And some not so much. E.g., clinical psychology. Many disciplines have schisms in them, especially when undergoing a paradigm shift. See previous discussion on paradigm shifts.<p><i>> As a second step, forbid any treatments not vetted by scientific research.</i><p>There's no central psychological organization that could do this.<p><i>> Conservation of energy is the explanation.</i><p>And in behavioral psychology, stimulus response is the explanation.<p><i>> It's disingenuous to claim that the conservation idea isn't an explanation</i><p>That's good, because that's not what I claimed. I claimed that physics offers no explanation for why the conservation laws apply, which is analogous to Behaviorism offering no explanation for why stimulus response applies. Both were low-level observed phenomena that were then used to explain higher-level phenomena.<p><i>> Need I add that there is nothing remotely like it in psychology for depth and
comprehensiveness.</i><p>Psychology is an intrinsically much more difficult field than physics. Physics is the Platonic ideal of science. Comparing other fields to it is what is disingenious. An honest debater might compare psychology to biology or economics or organic chemistry, fields where a grade school notion of what science is does not apply nearly so well.<p>And even in physics there are the type of divisions that you are describing. E.g., there is serious debate, for instance, on whether super string theory is a worthwhile approach, or not. Or even whether it is properly scientific.<p><i>> Meanwhile, in psychology, virtually all ideas are excuses for debates between differing factions.</i><p>I'm not aware of any serious debates against cognitive psychology. Other subfields are just a lot more impatient than cognitive psychologists are.<p><i>> As an example, one group thinks focusing a lot of attention on a few activities, or one activity, is a sign of mental illness (Asperger Syndrome). Another group thinks this exact same behavior is the only way to accomplish anything beyond the norm (the ""Grit"" faction).</i><p>This sort of thing happens all of the time in other sciences. Syndromes in medicine are very comparable, since for syndromes, no cause has usually been determined, and whether the syndrome is actually caused by a single disease or a number of different diseases is up for debate. And yet syndromes are treated by doctors anyway.<p><i>> And they don't bother to try to resolve the chasm between their views as scientists would do.</i><p>See previous discussion on paradigm shifts. Cognitive psychology is the future of psychology. It is perfectly scientific, and this is why there is a world-renowned department dedicated to it at MIT.",1360369894

This is the bare minimum you need to leak to make git diffs work, and there's also a security definition called ""deterministic CPA security"" which CTR with a synthetic IV provably meets.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/</a>",1360369024

Is that really a ""distortion""? It seems like the normal process of supply and demand to me.<p>What I'm taking issue with is the underlying hypocrisy of folks who want the benefits of this influx (higher taxes, more city services, young people moving to town and spending their money) while complaining about what they perceive to be the negative effects like higher rents and Google Buses. They fail to note how many negatives would come from _not_ having a robust industry locally - fewer city services due to less tax revenue, more crime and an aging population that earns less and leans on city services more.<p>SF spends more per-capita on social services and non-profits than just about any other major US city. That budget comes in large part from the paychecks of these single young people who are choosing to pay some of the highest total federal/state/city taxes in the nation.

Gold, a fungible, maleable, shiny metal has been considered to be this for most of human history. There are other things of course, water being a very good example.

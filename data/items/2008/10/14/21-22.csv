It's a real machine (not virtual or shared) and I've got real root access to it.  It comes with Fedora 3 or 4 and I upgraded it to Fedora 6 remotely, but I'm a little intimidated to upgrade beyond that without having physical access to the machine.  $30/mo, 200GB bandwidth @ 100Mbit, 30GB HD, 256M ram for starters.  There are other options.  I use S3 for storage of large data items.  All-in-all not too bad for a good hosting setup.  I host about 10 semi-active sites on that one machine.  My S3 monthly charges are $1 for my personal backups of important data and $30 for website data.<p>I know that there are plans out there for unmetered monthly data that's capped at a certain speed for a fixed low $$/mo (30-ish), but they tend to be virtual hosts.  You could get a real host (for the site and good performance) with capped bandwidth and a second host with unmetered bandwidth for the storage and delivery of your streaming media.  Best of both worlds kinda, but again S3 charges so little, that it may be better to just go through Amazon for the media.",1224021494

Brain regions don't have one function. If they did it would make our jobs that much easier! Instead, the amputation likely dampened activation associated with the hand (phantom pain results when it doesn't) and begins to respond to facial stimulation. But there's still some input to that region from the rest of the arm. By plugging in a new hand, the old region begins receiving very similar, but more extensive, input since the connecting nerves, spinal cord to brain, are intact. It's just a matter of the volume and frequency getting turned up. The more difficult part is the brain re-learning the fine motor skills because:<p><i>Savage’s recovery so far is limited to major nerves in the right hand, not to peripheral nerve connections for individual fingers, Frey says. It’s unclear how the neural map of the right hand will adapt as Savage’s finger nerves regenerate and finger sensation develops.</i>",1224021040

The 'information' was technically already out there, and the photographer merely aggregated it (lets say he also found out who lived in the apartment through information publicly available) and posted it online.<p>Can aggregation in itself be an act of intrusion?

The competition is ever-changing. If you can't control it and you can't really put your finger on it, then there's really no point worrying about it. You need to deliver the product that you think is good, that your customers want, not what their customers want.<p>2)  How they do PR:<p>So we've just chosen to teach and to tell a story about who we are and what we believe in. And I think when you teach people, you get a lot of attention. And when you share things a lot of companies would share, you get a lot of attention, and the media seems to have liked that a lot.<p>3)  Best advice he's ever gotten:\nThe best advice I've ever gotten in business is actually Jeff Bezos who is one of our ‚ I our only investor in our company. He said, you should focus on the things that don't change in your business, which I think is a really interesting way of looking at it. Think about the things that people are going to want today and ten years from now. That's what you should be investing in.<p>4)  On the benefits of laziness:<p>I mean I think laziness is a good thing in this sense. In that we don't really want to solve hard problems and do really hard work. We want to find out what the simple problems are and solve those, because I think most people's problems are pretty simple. So all this detailed integration\nwork with other products and third-party stuff and Facebook and all this other stuff, that's actually kind of a hard thing to do.

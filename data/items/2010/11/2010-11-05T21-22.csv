So, indeed, she has had several opportunities to ""get off the hook"" and, each time, the lawyers have come charging forward saying they will get her ultimately vindicated. Now, of course, she herself can't be excused because a client ultimately controls this decision no matter what the lawyers want to do. But lawyers are in a strong position to influence most clients and, as a middle-class mother of 4, I assume this client would not be taking ultra-aggressive legal steps unless the lawyers were encouraging this, in effect, making her a martyr for the cause (as ""Above the Law"" puts it: ""The crappy thing about being a martyr is that you have to die"" (<a href=""http://abovethelaw.com/2010/11/sorry-file-sharing-lady-looks-like-you-just-have-to-take-one-for-the-team/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abovethelaw.com/2010/11/sorry-file-sharing-lady-looks...</a>).<p>This case really illustrates the ugly face of aggressive copyright enforcement while at the same time highlighting the sometimes questionable judgments people can make in responding to it.",1288994336

For some reason, the fact that Pylons 1.0 hasn't had any updates or feature additions in the 6+ months hasn't seemed to be an issue, it was already mostly in a ""it works as well as it can work"" stage.<p>Plugging in the old Pylons app using WSGI isn't really any more kludgey than using WSGI for any other app composition use, which is plentiful.<p>For the second question, the best reason would be that in the world of web development, <i>all</i> web frameworks will deprecate old technology. It's the only way to move forward if a fundamental design decision in the core needs to be re-architected.<p>I know many former TurboGears users may have a lot of angst about this, because the rug has been pulled out a bit more than for Pylons users, who have rarely had to deal with everything at the bottom being replaced. This direction was taken to help <i>avoid</i> that again in the future, because now all the development for everything... top to bottom... we have under one roof so to speak.<p>In pyramid we have a core that <i>is</i> architected to deal with the extensibility issue, and can pick up development of features that the Pylons 1.0 code-base couldn't handle. Since its based on over 2 years of development and use in the repoze.bfg community, it means its <i>very</i> solid and stable already.<p>In short, I think it's on track to be one of the most stable Python web frameworks out there, just like Pylons 1.0 and prior has been quite stable. My advice would be to try new, small experiments and projects with it first. I'll be publishing more articles highlighting the improvements and extra features it brings to the table soon.",1288993752

This virtual world is designed for a niche, lets say vehicle mechanics. You can look at any vehicle and strip it down or away to see each layer like an onion skin in my world. Why should your browser do that instead of giving it over to a plugin by the format company's author?<p>If your browser does that the people that write the browser have to support it to a certain extent - if they implement the popen() function in the spec, well they're importing the standard into the browser but if popen(""/bin/ls"") works then so should popen(""/bin/ls;cat%20/etc/passwd"").<p>My point is that the people that make browsers make really great browsers, the people that make PDF readers make great PDF readers. To pull the browser guys off to make a PDF reader is the same as pulling a PDF reader guy to make a browser, it's not their core business.<p>I'd rather trust a company for whom PDF reading is core business (like sumatra) than those that feel PDF reading is only part of their revenue stream (like adobe).",1288991275

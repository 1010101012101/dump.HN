The key thing to understand is that the FISC court is not making law. It is interpreting the government&#x27;s powers under existing law. This is a process the executive regularly engages in: it asks itself, is this activity legal? This is the only way it can act, indeed the only way anyone can act, within a federal court system that does not allow courts to issue advisory opinions. You interpret the law to determine whether your course of action is constitutional.<p>Without secret FISC rulings, you&#x27;d have secret NSA legal interpretations. The FISC can&#x27;t grant the executive any power it didn&#x27;t otherwise have--it exists instead as a check on the discretion the executive would otherwise have in using that power. Nothing forces the government, or any other entity, to publicize its interpretation of law until it is challenged in public court.<p>EDIT: I should note that I don&#x27;t think the DOJ&#x27;s argument is necessarily the &quot;right&quot; one. Or the &quot;best&quot; one. But I think it&#x27;s sound. It&#x27;s based on a conservative interpretation of the scope of the executive&#x27;s powers, but not one that&#x27;s outside the mainstream.",1373324231

6009920,comment,6009435,6009435,1,0,alok-g,,,">> Crazy tax incentives. Mortgage interest is tax deductible in the US and capital gains from selling your home is largely tax-exempt. As part of the current fiscal stimulus plan, many first-time home buyers even qualify for an outright gift from the government of $8000 just to buy a house.<p>Even this nay not be a valid reason for buying against renting.  This would just lead to more buying power for buyers and raise the selling prices of the homes till a good fraction of the tax/gifts actually disappears.<p>If the market were 100% rational, which includes rational decision making, having access to all needed data, etc., then buying and renting would end up being equal except for transitory effects.  Since however, more people are inclined to buy due to various myths, renting should actually be better than buying for those who realize that those are just myths.  This is because the myths would raise the prices of buying artificially beyond what they should be in a rational market.<p>However, even this is not necessarily true since there are still more factors coming from myths and human irrational behavior, unavailability of the needed data, etc. because of which the problem becomes way more unpredictable to solve rationally even for those who are rational.<p>My conclusion has been that you must therefore look at your specific case, and the locality you are living in and figure what is better for you.  Here [1] is the most complete and sophisticated buy-vs.-rent calculator that I have seen, which takes all important quantifiable things into account.  The issue of course again is that you have to feed in your own future predictions about where the market is going to make a wise decision out of it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://michaelbluejay.com/house/rentvsbuy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelbluejay.com/house/rentvsbuy.html</a>",1373324055

6009900,comment,6007778,6009214,5,0,BorgHunter,,,"> Is it the case that everywhere people are yearning for more taxi service, or to own their own vehicles?<p>Everywhere? You can&#x27;t make generalizations like that, because there isn&#x27;t a global trend. In developing countries, demand for car ownership is up, because of increasing affluence and the poor state of infrastructure in those countries. In developed countries, demand for car ownership is down, because of halting suburbanization, increasing awareness of expenses and externalities of car ownership, and availability of comparable alternatives. This is most apparent in Europe, but the long-term trend is downward in North America as well.<p>As for your analogies, they do not seem very apt. A major benefit to cell phone ownership is the ability to be contacted by or to contact people at any time, which a payphone does not provide. A major benefit to washing machine ownership is the ability to do laundry without schlepping your heavy clothes three blocks to the laundromat. The major benefit to car ownershippoint to point transportation, on demandwould be provided by a competent robotaxi service. It won&#x27;t <i>kill</i> car ownership, but for a significant number of people, robotaxis would provide everything they need out of a transportation, at a fraction of the cost.<p>Contrary to what you&#x27;ve been stating, there <i>is</i> precedent for replacing goods with services. Quite recent precedent, in fact. How many people do you know who subscribe to a service like Netflix? Of those people, do you think their consumption of DVDs (and, prior to that, VHS tapes) went up or down once they got Netflix? What about music: How many people are buying physical CDs these days, do you think, compared to in 2000? Sometimes a centralized service is superior, sometimes it isn&#x27;t. The market will decide.<p>Between car ownership and robotaxis, I know which one I&#x27;d choose. There are a lot of people in this thread who agree with me. I think your &quot;I don&#x27;t know, everyone?&quot; is entirely unjustified and I think you&#x27;re vastly underestimating the frustration and expense involved in car ownership for a large number of people.",1373323898

That said, there are a lot of caveats with the road we&#x27;re on just now.<p>One of these is that Google is driving this forward as a single player, and - have no doubt - that&#x27;s where they want to be.  If we place all of our sousveillance content with one organization, then we place a lot of trust in that organization to keep it safe, not censor it against our wishes, and so forth.<p>I trust Google a lot more than many, many other companies, but ultimately it is still possible for it to be strong-armed and pressured into doing things behind the scenes which may or may not be to everyone&#x27;s benefit - or more typically, are to a specific cause&#x27;s benefit, or for pure business reasons.<p>For a truly open, transparent future we&#x27;d need some kind of distributed, reliable shared fabric into which sousveillance content could be stored - and also potentially analyzed if we want to make use of the additional benefits of image/video/audio recognition, tagging etc.<p>And that&#x27;s when the challenges of bandwidth, latency, availability of technical expertise, infrastructure cost, etc all come into play, so I think at least in the near term we are still looking at placing our trust in one of a few providers.<p>PS: Also I&#x27;d add that sousveillance isn&#x27;t a magical fix-all; if you have a recording of someone taking a swing at you with a weapon, that isn&#x27;t evidence that you weren&#x27;t spending the previous few hours tormenting them - there will be situations of selective editing and misrepresentation, just as there are in other forms of media.",1373323261

Burglars stole three computers and broke into the firm&#x27;s file cabinets. But silver bars, video equipment and other valuables were left untouched, according to local Fox affiliate KDFW, which aired security camera footage of the suspected burglars entering and leaving the offices around the time of the incident.<p>The firm Schulman & Mathias represents Aurelia Fedenisn, a former investigator at the State Department&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General. In recent weeks, she raised a slew of explosive allegations against the department and its contractors ranging from illicit drug use, soliciting sexual favors from minors and prostitutes and sexual harassment.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a crazy, strange and suspicious situation,&quot; attorney Cary Schulman told The Cable. &quot;It&#x27;s clear to me that it was somebody looking for information and not money. My most high-profile case right now is the Aurelia Fedenisn case, and I can&#x27;t think of any other case where someone would go to these great lengths to get our information.&quot;<p>According to the KDFW report, the firm was the only suite burglarized in the high-rise office building and an unlocked office adjacent was left untouched.<p>The State Department, which has repeatedly disputed Fedenisn&#x27;s allegations, denied any involvement in the incident. &quot;Any allegation that the Department of State authorized someone to break into Mr. Schulman&#x27;s law firm is false and baseless,&quot; spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.<p>After assessing the surveillance footage, Schulman said he believed the motivations were likely political, but did not suspect department involvement. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t professional enough,&quot; he said. &quot;It is possible that an Obama or Hillary supporter feels that I am unfairly going after them. And the timing of this is right after several weeks of very public media attention so it seems to me most likely that the information sought is related to that case. I don&#x27;t know for sure and I want the police to do their work.&quot;<p>Fedenisn&#x27;s case, in particular, has gained attention not just because of the substance of the allegations, but for her insistence that internal investigations into misconduct were &quot;influenced, manipulated or simply called off&quot; by senior State Department officials. The suppression of investigations was noted in an early draft of an Inspector General report she gave to CBS News, but softened in the final version.<p>Last month, her lawyers told The Cable that the department tried to intimidate her into silence. &quot;They had law enforcement officers camp out in front of her house, harass her children and attempt to incriminate herself,&quot; claimed Schulman.<p>Schulman said the purpose of the visit was to get Fedenisn to sign documents admitting that she stole State Department documents -- a charge Fedenisn denies.<p>Schulman & Mathias represent a range of clients on matters from fraud to wrongful death to bad faith insurance practices to medical malpractice. Any number of those cases could&#x27;ve exposed the firm to such a break in, but Schulman said he was skeptical. &quot;I&#x27;m involved in other cases locally, but those cases are rather stale.&quot;</i>",1373322622

The most clear-cut example is that of medical discussions; medical commentary or speculation from under-qualified individuals can do real harm.   Many communities on the web have recognized this and have taken measures to protect users[1].<p>Medical advice is a pretty extreme example as far as detrimental discussions, but there are some shades of gray that I&#x27;ve seen show up on HN. As a biologist, the ones I&#x27;ve found most grating are those that reflect poor training in the the life sciences, where HNers make pseudoscientific or unscientific claims. It&#x27;s easy to call these things &quot;opinions&quot;, but they are actively harmful when most users will not be able to tell that they are incorrect.<p>There are certainly other cases where underinformed commenters  end up doing harm, from legal speculation to &quot;get your pitchforks&quot; outrage attacks.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not arguing against free and open discussion in forums such as HN; people should be physically able to post whatever they want. My point is instead that the community should be sensitive to underqualified commentary in disciplines beyond its expertise. Less accepting, in a way.<p>Credentialing is but one way this has been done, but understandably not the best one here.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s4chc/meta_medical_advice_on_askscience_the_guidelines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s4chc/meta_medic...</a>",1373322164

There&#x27;s a lot that can be said here, but I will keep it to what I think are the few most important ideas I can communicate. If these don&#x27;t work for you, please comment here and let me know your thoughts.<p>1. If you intend to kill yourself or someone else, please call this number: 1-800-273-8255. It is a crisis hotline for suicidality. Even if you are highly doubtful that it can help, make the call. Everyone who is suicidal is highly doubtful there&#x27;s a better way, almost by definition. And yet this number does help the vast majority of those people who do call it. It&#x27;s worth a chance.<p>2. You seem to be describing a &quot;major depressive episode.&quot; This is not something you should try to address only through self-help or HN (though taking the steps you have taken was an excellent move in that it is going to help you find the next ones to take).<p>For one thing, there is a physiological element that medication may be required to address. For another thing, the very faculties that you would use to try to help yourself are almost certainly hindered and distorted while in this depressed state. Your problem-solving abilities are likely compromised. Your ability to see alternatives is likely compromised. Your sense of realism in evaluating your situation is likely compromised.<p>You should seek professional help - from a professional counselor, clinical social worker, clinical or counseling psychologist, or psychiatrist. I would say the same thing even if you were one of those things.<p>3. There are barriers to seeing a professional for many people. It might be money, it might be stigma, it might be bad experiences in the past, lack of motivation, lack of information, feelings that it won&#x27;t be helpful -- it&#x27;s different for different people.<p>Also, some people will see a therapist one or two times and then decide that therapy didn&#x27;t work. Therapists are like graphic designers, software engineers, carpenters, or any other profession -- there is variable quality and variable styles. And even among the good ones, some of them may just not a fit for you.<p>But I assure you there are competent therapists that you will feel a connection with. In fact, most therapists are pretty solid people to sit down with, and they won&#x27;t have their feelings hurt if they turn out not to be the one to help you -- they&#x27;ll want to help you find that one.<p>So consult with a professional. Make a call. Schedule an appointment. Tell them where you are. And if they suck or you don&#x27;t like them, go try another one.<p>4. Depression can cause hopelessness, and it feels real and appears real -- that the world is actually that way, that life will always be that way. You can&#x27;t trust those thoughts and feelings. You&#x27;ve got to take some steps in spite of them. Recognize that it is as if you are under a dark spell. Resist the influence of that dark spell as you try to get it lifted.<p>5. As I said above, I will check back here tonight to see if you reply to this. Odds are good that you are skeptical about some or all of what I&#x27;ve said here (though if you&#x27;re not, that&#x27;s fine too). I can&#x27;t provide therapy (and this isn&#x27;t therapy), but I can help with this kind of process of seeking information and exploring your options.<p>Edit: 6. (Forgot to add...) You should be very very careful with drugs and alcohol right now. Many people who are depressed but not actively suicidal take their lives when under the influence.",1373321870

The message was that if most of the users are likely to take the action, then undo is better than confirmation, and if most of the users are unlikely to take the action, then a confirmation is better.<p>While it is bad to provide every option to the user, it is also just as bad to miss the options that the users commonly use.<p>The real question then is if a set is commonly required or not.

Not even criminals deserve this level of surveillance, it is abhorrent nonsense out of 1984. And we accept it just because we change the &#x27;sur&#x27; to &#x27;sous&#x27; on the grounds that the government is not allowed to do it?<p>Believe me, if constant personal surveillance in every moment and place becomes generally socially acceptable, there will be nothing to stop &#x27;surveillance&#x27;.",1373320853

Some people very likely will be offended by these ideas. Some people will get angry. Some people won&#x27;t believe what they&#x27;re reading or hearing. But those are all good things. They indicate that there is a wide variety of thought going on.<p>Communities that are kept &quot;civil&quot; through the use of excessive moderation, for example, thrive only in a very superficial way. Given enough time, intellectual inbreeding happens, where the vast majority of participants adhere to a very strict dogma. Any real contemplation is quickly extinguished. The end result is a very bland type of thought, devoid of real substance. It&#x27;s not truly healthy, even though it might look good on the surface.",1373320814

Standard notation isn&#x27;t absolutely perfect but it&#x27;s pretty darn good.  If a symphony can come out of dozens of musicians consistently by using standard notation I think we are OK.<p>I think the problem often has to do with not wanting to put in the time to master not only the notation and the instrument but also the hours and hours of work required to crate the synaptic connections necessary to read and play without thinking.<p>It&#x27;s like complaining about vim because it is hard to learn.

Not to say it&#x27;s nearly impossible to read the music note-by-note as you play, so you are always thinking in patterns which are hard to recognize when written like that.<p>So, no way it could replace traditional notation. It could be used to show how to play something to a newcomer, but it&#x27;s not novel, then — I&#x27;ve seen visualizations with highlighted piano keys since like as long as I remember myself.

Take StateT and ExceptT for example: you can compose them in two ways, and get two different monad transformer stacks, with different behaviors (surrounding how state propagates when an exception occurs). There are valid use cases for each, but with the ST and Exception effects, there is only one way to combine them: the way the underlying (Javascript) runtimes chooses for us.<p>There are things which each one can do which the other cannot. Fortunately, we can mix and match in PureScript since we have the purescript-transformers library. A typical arrangement is to stick Eff on the bottom of a monad transformer stack.<p>_Edit_: of course, everything you can do with a monad transformer can be done more verbosely with pure functions and the underlying monad, so you _could_ replace monad transformers with Eff in many cases, but in practical terms, it might not be all that useable in some cases.",1436067857

Once I got to a certain level with the violin, I didn&#x27;t have to think about how notes mapped to the violin physically, but was able to think more in terms of music theory (or at least it was rather easy to switch between the two).  This opens up an entire world if you start tinkering with improvisation and gives you a common language with other musicians.<p>I think staff notation is also quite amazing because it represents music in such a way that it can be easily understood by musicians of many, many instruments at a glance.  Imagine writing a symphony of however many instruments in different kinds of notation, or being the conductor who has to read it all simultaneously...<p>All that being said, I could totally imagine a world where a huge percentage of musicians (especially amateurs) learn only these easily readable musical languages, while people who want to dive deeper learn staff.",1436066892

You&#x27;re doing a smart thing to start learning UI/UX but I would really recommend just getting a few blank notebooks and drawing things out.  If you have any ideas for sites or services that would be useful, you can draw them screen-by-screen and see where that leads.  Even if you have no coding experience, if people see that you are passionate about it they will be happy to help you.  Offer to buy people a coffee and sit and chat with them about it.  You can learn a lot watching how other people approach their problems and how they creatively think about things.<p>In terms of programming languages, you&#x27;ll at least want to know how to use javascript html and css to manipulate things in a browser.  That stuff is not too hard to pick up (google be your guide) and will open up the door of potential in making user interfaces and mockups.<p>If you want to get with a startup, I suppose you could move to Palo Alto, but an &quot;early stage startup&quot; is really &quot;that guy with his awesome idea and his friend who is helping him code it.&quot;  So you should plant some seeds by helping people find good friends to work with.  Resulting fruit can come indirectly and in a variety of shapes/configurations so don&#x27;t be too picky on the form it takes.<p>Above all, the key to contentment and succeeding in any field is to rejoice in your small attainments and progresses.  If you draw a cool design down today or think of a fun logo, be happy you did.  If you helped someone with their job interview, rejoice.  If you were able to hook someone up in a helpful way, even with just a kind word, or show them a new approach to a problem, be happy that you did so.<p>Develop the habit of learning enough so you can start to play around with it yourself for a while.  It&#x27;s like sculpting or playing chess.  You could read books all day but until you sit down to do it, the process won&#x27;t _really_ sink in.  I saw a nice image earlier about &#x27;how to design in increments&#x27; ... you can&#x27;t start with 1 wheel and then 4 wheels and then immediately have a car.  You start with a skateboard, you go to a scooter, then a bicycle, then a motorcycle, and then a car.  Each step is useful in its own way, and I think it helps illustrate how one should go about learning new &quot;tech&quot; i.e. coding skills:  learn enough to tinker around on your own for a while/as long as possible, and then learn more.<p>Nobody was born speaking perfect English, Shakespeare had to learn everything he was capable of.  It all takes practice but with dedicated, happy effort (Quality practice, not quantity), you can make huge strides quickly.<p>Most startup people really want someone to share their idea with, at least someone who _believes_ in their idea.  Providing this validation is super important, and I think you&#x27;ll find that if you encourage people in their pursuits, you will experience great rewards just as a matter of life.",1436066620

After some &quot;public discussions&quot;, it was decided they would go it on their own.  And a key learning that came out of that public discussion was to ensure females were involved in the process:<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/22/iceland-women"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/22/iceland-women</a><p>And by most accounts, Iceland is now doing generally &quot;ok&quot;.<p>By the way, I have no idea if that article is at all authoritative on the topic of Iceland or females role in its recovery, I did a 5 second google search.  My point is, as the author of the article (that is the topic of this post) clearly pointed out, the original deal with Greece was built on a fair amount of lies, that everyone <i>knew</i> were lies.  I particularly liked the reference to this term:  <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IBGYBG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IBGYBG</a><p>And my experience (as a man), dealing with other men for many decades now is:  a certain subset of men have absolutely no moral qualms about lying in the pursuit of power; other men of the same personality type, even if <i>seemingly</i> enemies, are happy to go along, and the collusion between these opposing actors who share the same mindset often results in them all rising into positions of extreme power, and they eventually blow the whole place up.  It&#x27;s probably always been this way in a sense - in the good old days, it resulted in war -  nowadays, it results in financial markets blowing up.<p>I know there are all sorts of holes in my &quot;theory of the world&quot;, and I don&#x27;t even care, because this same shit will continue to happen indefinitely, and it will always be men running the show, but there&#x27;s no way to prove causation because it will <i>always</i> be men running the show.",1436065992

Take it with a grain of salt but these types of ideas are what we are working on every day consistently attempting to improve or refine. The following are my own thoughts:<p>I agree that the desktop interface is stagnating - but the WIMP methodology is still bar none for discoverability and learnability, and if you&#x27;re a company making money from the enterprise market, you will always be torn between desiring and pushing innovation and maintaining consistency.<p>However one thing I think we are doing now that is very interesting is attempting to reconcile the world of WIMP (desktop) with the FIM paradigm (finger icon menu - I made this up - ie mobile). Despite their similarities there is a HUGE challenge to meet the user&#x27;s expectations when you are not fixed in one model.<p>There are a few different points of view I see in the industry - one is that people will get better at the touch language and our interfaces will evolve to support complex touch interactions. And some who think that we have achieved the optimal method for efficient interaction and and the optimal method for mobile quick interaction and that the two worlds should be separate. And still others who believe the best interaction method is still out there (gestures, voice, pen, natural language, ai etc.)<p>The view of windows 10 is that these two interaction paradigms or mental models support two semi formed methods of computing that are continually converging. The attempt is to create a UI that is adaptive to the users goal and should support: WIMP, FIM or a crossover between the two. The closest analogy is definitely responsive web design.<p>There are huge drawbacks to this such as complexity, and current user expectations. But also huge benefits such as computing that is less tied to a device or input method, and lets you choose the best tool for your task at hand.<p>I think it will be very interesting to see how the market reacts to this convergence, and if microsoft is able to communicate real user benefits from this type of experience. So far, it seems like simplicity is key.<p>As a tech geek and designer, I&#x27;m excited for the next 5-10 years of interaction design. I think a lot will change with new tech (AR/VR + natural language + ai) and the continual evolution of our existing UIs. I don&#x27;t expect many major shift within already established interaction paradigms, but shifts that will influence them from outside technology.<p>edit: there are so many facets to this that I couldn&#x27;t capture them all - but I wanted to comment on the card metaphor. To me it&#x27;s a symptom of designers and devs looking for a metaphor that is able to cross between devices, screens and surfaces and  escape the boundaries of the WIMP methodology. The fact that these types of metaphors are arising naturally in the world of software is a signal that the zerox/parc metaphor approach is still the best for mass market adoption. And seem to be the most well adopted to the environment we have created.",1436065960

Remote files are not local files, but local files are remote files: or more precisely, local files are a special case of remote files from the point of view of file access. If your filesystem API starts with the assumption that files are remote and must be handled as if they are remote, then you get pretty good local file access for free, as HTTP has been demonstrating for a couple of decades now. Of course if you instead start with the assumption that files are local and thus it&#x27;s safe to do blocking I/O on them then when you add remote files you&#x27;ll end up with an NFS-like mess instead. That doesn&#x27;t prove that abstraction and generalisation can&#x27;t work cleanly, it just shows that you were looking through the wrong end of the telescope. (Really, the distinction here isn&#x27;t truly between remote and local but between unreliable and reliable. All remote file access may be unreliable, but it&#x27;s certainly not the case that all local file access is reliable, or should be expected to be reliable. Especially not when you bring in user-space filesystems, as Plan 9 does.)

That&#x27;s a great idea.<p>However, I&#x27;m skeptical that this is it. First, looking at the 2 notations of &quot;Let it Be,&quot; we can see that the new notation does not convey the same data, or even a simplified version of it. It&#x27;s a different version of it. I find that odd.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t think learning music notation is very difficult. I learned to read treble and bass clef when I was 5 years old. It was much harder trying to make my fingers press the right keys at the right time than memorizing which circle on which line matched with which key or note.<p>Looking at this, I&#x27;m reminded of Laban notation (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_Movement_Analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_Movement_Analysis</a>) and Benesh Notation (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benesh_Movement_Notation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benesh_Movement_Notation</a>) for notating dance. Both are very complicated and essentially never used by the people who actually do the dancing. Furthermore, I&#x27;m told that Benesh, for example, allows a notator to add written (human-language) notes below the staff to convey additional information. In other words, they know it doesn&#x27;t convey everything it&#x27;s supposed to.<p>So what do dancers do? They learn from video. They watch the masters who went before them directly performing the movement. Frankly, I think it would be great to see something similar for music. Having a video of someone playing a keyboard from above, possibly with a graphical overlay showing the notes pressed would be way better (in my opinion).

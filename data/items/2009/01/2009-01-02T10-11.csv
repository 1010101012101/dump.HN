In direct response to 1: ""The researchers had already discovered that each session of intellectual work requires only three calories more than the rest period."" So, yes, it does, but apparently the change in appetite more than offsets the increased consumption.<p>And as for 2, this complaint is a pet peeve of mine. Yes, bigger sample sizes are (often) better, but sometimes you can't get a bigger sample. Size of sample and representativeness are kind of orthogonal, if all humans were homogeneous, sample sizes of one would be totally sufficient. (Basically, sure, there could be uncorrected bias, but please point to a bias that you think is unaccounted for, and not just ""should have paid for more subjects"".)<p>Honestly, it kind of sounds like you want the study results to be something since you have preconceived expectations that thinking hard should use more energy. I'm not trying to be combative here, but I don't really know of anything wrong with their methodology. I haven't read the paper in question, but presumably neither have you, so we're two people on the internet arguing about something we haven't even read. Whoo, yay internet!",1230893130

417254,comment,416409,417099,0,0,netcan,,,"Sure, but I'm arguing a bit more then that.<p>I'm arguing that it's fine to have some companies that don't pay dividends. Fine in a world where the standard is dividend paying companies. Once they become the exception, once you stop even speculating about what they would be paying if they where paying, once you start talking about, game's up. Stock becomes trading cards.<p>BTW, it's not just not paying. Paying 1-3% is the same sort of issue just that then it's the investors rather then the companies <i>fault.</i><p>But then, all that says. It still works. Sort of. Baffles me.",1230892457

You see these kinds of adolescents all the time, which is why you recognise that stereotype.<p>You have never met a TCS-raised child. Why do you think that TCS, which you have never encountered, will without doubt produce this stereotype of teenager, which you have encountered often?",1230891836

417247,comment,416647,416693,0,0,litewulf,,,"I want to say something about leaky abstractions and caution the reader that writing code that you then pass to something that generates some other code is a very very scary thing by and large. The Java compiler and gcc are really mature, and every so often bugs are still spotted. Imagine if you're super-awesome-Objective-C-to-Javascript compiler has a bug. How do you know if the bug is in your Objective-C code, in the compiler, or just a weird browser oddity? Basically you end up kind of needing to know everything between you and the browser, so it may be a good idea to minimize those things.<p>(Actually, I recommend sitting down and writing Javascript without a library, just so you have an idea of what works and what doesn't across browser. It was somewhat surprising for me to be sure.)",1230891516

417242,comment,416647,417126,0,0,litewulf,,,"I actually use GWT, and my advice is to be very careful.<p>I've managed to have bugs that show up in the browser that I have had an amazingly difficult time tracking down. You get a pile of javascript from your pile of java, and it can be hard to tell where the bug is at all.<p>Complexity is dangerous, and GWT is fantastically complicated. I haven't run into a GWT compilation bug, but I'm sure there exists such a thing, and the day I run into it I will simply sit down and cry because I have no other recourse.<p>(But when it works, I guess its kind of a nice way to build UIs, if you like Java-style UI APIs... I've never met such a person, but I'm sure they exist ;))",1230891202
417241,comment,416732,416732,0,0,sl956,,,"Of course it is crazy. So what? I did it 7 months ago. Leaved what had become a 350 people company to start a new project. Back to square one. Not a single regret.<p>I for one like the timing: 
First, most blue chips are now completely focused on their core business. Perfect times to try to quietly take the lead on wide open niche or emerging markets.
Moreover, lots of smart people are leaving their employers  (voluntarily or otherwise) or are just tired of seeing their company going down the drain. Perfect times to hire bright people for cheap.<p>That's why I don't think your timing is wrong at all. That is, if your project does not require massive initial funding, because I do have some doubts about funding in the current environment. I usually don't bother to see VCs before breaking even and being able to show 7 figures in sales or revenue. Just arriving around there on the current project, so this month should be the start of the VC pitching circus. We shall see...<p>All in all, there is no absolutely good or bad timing: it may be the layoff business or the cost-cutting industry right now, but there is always some growth sector worth exploring. It is always the right time to start something whose time has come.<p>Go for it. Work hard. Have fun.
...and let us know how it turns out. :)",1230891038

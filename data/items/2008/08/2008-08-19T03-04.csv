The (admittedly imprecise) verdict?  If you swapped in Google branding, and added an ""I'm feeling lucky button"" (the only thing I truly miss), I wouldn't notice the difference.  (I'd wager Microsoft Live would yield similar results.)<p>Google leads now by branding.  The gap between the major search engines has narrowed to indistinguishability.",1219117904
279997,comment,279437,279437,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"You will have to look at documentation like everything else having to do with your startup.  Document only if it provides a high return on your time and resources.  Ask yourself at each point while you work on your project: 'What can I do now that benefits my business the most?'  When the answer is documentation, then document.  That's a major benefit of running your own business: no one gets to dictate your priorities to you.  So enjoy that freedom.",1219117875
279996,comment,279884,279884,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That is the worst logic I've ever seen. Loosely translated:<p>""Microsoft makes hit tons of money, both per employee and overall, a huge chunk of which comes from their Office products. Google makes slightly more money per employee, but far less overall, none of which comes from their Office products.<p>Therefore, Google would not want to succeed in the Office space. Why? Because Adobe doesn't make all that much.""<p>Huh? I'm just going to assume, since the poster's name is Sridhar, that he actually just doesn't speak English well enough to express his thoughts coherently, because it is either that or he doesn't have them.",1219117863
279994,comment,279884,279884,0,0,daveambrose,,,"""Now it is clear why we compete with Google. Google is perhaps the most stunning technology success story ever, but we simply don’t believe Google has the rational business incentive to get too deep into the business/IT software category. The lower revenue and profit per employee figures would be tolerable if there were huge growth opportunities there, but when very successful companies like Adobe and Intuit pull in revenues well shy of a Yahoo, when even the enterprise software leader SAP is smaller, and slower growing than Google (Google makes nearly as much in  profit  per employee as SAP or Oracle Salesforce make in  revenue per employee), it is fairly clear this market is not going to make a material contribution to Google’s growth and profitability objectives. So what is Google’s plan here? It is fairly obvious they are in it to put Microsoft on the defensive on its home turf, so that Microsoft’s offensive capability in the internet is diminished. It is also perfectly clear why Microsoft wants to be an internet player - as Google has shown, it is a higher margin business even than its monopoly-profit core business.""",1219117583

Using <a href=""http://www.lulu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lulu.com/</a> you can get prices of $8 per copy plus $8 postage, and you provide a PDF (around 250 pages is ideal). It's $16 per item too - no need for an order of say 30 books. Multiply that into $300 and that's quite a few books you can stack on the shelf.",1219116297

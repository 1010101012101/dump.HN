278405,comment,278250,278361,0,0,chandler,,,"Reading these posts about the ""excellent, bug free"" VS development environment: in my experience, this isn't quite the truth.<p>I've used VS6 since the late 90's, mostly on small projects (less than ~10 000 lines, four or five source files) until 2004, where I signed up to work maintenance on what is essentially a very large codebase (thousands of source files, between 500-50 000 lines per file).  In 2006, my frustration with VS6's inability to handle a codebase of this magnitude finally convinced me to try a different IDE toolset.  My specific complaints:<p>- Starting VS6 is slow, and brings the computer to a halt.<p>- Compiling & linking through the IDE is slow, and brings my computer to a halt.  This doesn't happen when run from the commandline, nor, as follows, from a subprocess within Emacs.<p>- Intellisense stops working <i>a lot</i>; nothing breaks programming flow like having your favorite crutch be unavailable for half the methods (this seems to affect large files more than small).  Incidentally, though Emacs has Intellisense type functionality, I much prefer the generic completion available in Emacs/Vim (M-/ in Emacs, Ctrl-N in Vim), as it works within comments and for undefined/undeclared (and unprocessed) structures.<p>- The method navigation panel fails often, with it listing a method correctly, but displaying ""method not found"" when selected (the workaround is to select different methods until one <i>is</i> found, then jump around the file for the desired method).  I suspect this is related to the parser not handling default arguments correctly in certain cases.<p>Finally, VS is the only application that has blue-screened my XP machine (this happened only twice, however, and wasn't involved in my decision to migrate to a different toolset).<p>Regarding software, either you bend software to meet your needs, or it bends you to meet its limitations.  Unfortunately, because VS has a high difficulty regarding the former, I found I was consistently having to integrate workarounds into my day to day coding practices.",1218988292

278402,story,,,3,2,thisisnotmyname,"Ask YC - Selling software to large companies",,"I spend a substantial amount of time working with a particular type of bioinformatics data which is collected and organized by about 5 companies.  During a recent painful session, I had an idea for an interface that would greatly improve the experience.  It is quite simple, but also quite novel.  I mocked it up and showed it to some other people who work in the same area as I do, and they all agree it is an improvement over what is available.  I would love to try to sell the interface to one of the companies who work in the area.  My question is, has anyone ever tried to sell software to a large company?  Is it possible to protect your idea even while shopping it around?",1218987275
278401,comment,278300,278300,0,0,tstegart,,,"I would strongly recommend building a side project while you work on finding your jobs. Clients are impressed when they see what you can actually do rather than just what you say you can do. Not to mention a side project would not have the constraints of a client, so you can make it really awesome (i.e. no ""we need to use teal, its our company color""). Another plus is multiple side projects in different languages, so it shows you have wicked programming smarts and can pick up new skills if needed.",1218987091

278387,comment,278120,278369,0,0,indiejade,,,"Conversely, radio stations are often <i>paid</i> by major labels to repeatedly play/promote certain artists.  If you've ever listened to a ""popular"" music station and wondered why certain songs seem to get played again and again -- sometimes as much as every hour -- that's why.  There's actually some kind of psychology thing involved; the more times a person hears a song, the more likely that person is to end up liking it.<p>This whole thing reeks because it's basically the RIAA and major labels getting into a  big huff because they are losing control over the outlets that they used to control.",1218985446

You're correct that price is not currently a restriction in every case, but there's a good case to be made for compulsory licensing (which is partially a price limit).<p>Copyright law creates artificial monopolies.  Market based pricing breaks down in the face of a monopoly.  Given that we're dealing with state enabled monopolies, it seems reasonable that we should clamor for changes to the framework they operate under.",1218985293

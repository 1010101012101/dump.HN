Had to put my credit card details in for a free month I was gifted. First had to signup for the free trial month, putting in my credit card at that point. The gift month wasn't added. After 2 or 3 phone calls to Netflix support, and over an hour later the second month was added.<p>I had asked and was promised that I would be getting an email letting me know 1 week before that the renewal period was approaching. No email ever came of course.<p>Might seem small, but doing these kinds of tactics on a large scale, with tens of millions of users - they know the recurring rate will be higher, and many people will keep getting billed without remembering or realizing, even if it's for 3+ months.

4785826,comment,4763564,4784179,1,0,talmand,,,"I apologize, I fail to see how what you want to do is any different than what you can do today. Almost everything you just said is what I've been saying the whole time. You can create a CSS class in either a external style sheet or in a style section in the head of the document and use javascript to apply that class to any element on the page. Since you are already using CSS selector syntax in javascript to target these elements I really don't see how having something in between that makes it any easier. If I understand what you are saying, you wish to remove the selector part out of CSS and apply it directly to elements as they are used. But, again, that's already there, right now, today, for you to use with no third-party tool with its own syntax/language to get in the way.<p>All I can see at this point is that you wish to stop using CSS selectors but still use CSS syntax in describing properties of the elements to be styled. As stated in the beginning, you wish to remove CSS for styling and replace it with something else for, styling. That makes no sense. You are already using these very same selectors to target these elements with javascript. Plus the same syntax can be used in any programming language that outputs HTML, just assign class names to the element as they are created.<p>Since you propose to no longer use CSS syntax nor selectors in styling elements then I require an example of how you propose to handle this with current browsers. I really just don't understand the concept of creating CSS to style elements without using CSS, that's the circular argument you are using.<p>You say you want a single styling API, that already exists and it's named CSS.",1352930321

It's based on usage, which means that the bill at the end of the month can end up being an unpleasant surprise, as it has been for lots and lots of AWS users over the years. Who can know in advance what their usage figures will be?<p>RAM-based pricing means that the bill at the end of the month literally cannot be a surprise. We have four available plans, and monthly bills map directly and seamlessly onto those plans.<p>We run on AWS (among others) but WE pay AWS, not our customers, because we think that part of the mission of PaaS is to shield customers from the many disparate pricing models on different IaaS providers. Want to run on Rackspace via AppFog? Same price. Want to run on HP? Same price. Azure? Same price.<p>PaaS needs to abstract hardware away completely, even monetarily.

It has always seemed to me like composition is more flexible.<p>To give concrete examples: using composition, if instance A has a B, then at runtime you can replace the pointer to the B with a pointer to a C such that now A has a C.  You basically change the type of A by changing where messages get sent / delegated.<p>With inheritance, you'd have B is an A and C is an A, and the relationships here are static unless you start messing around with reflection and dynamic class loading and stuff.<p>The tradeoff for the flexibility of composition is more verbose code, I think.",1352930058

This realtor talked a good game and was decent at getting people through the house, holding open houses, ongoing marketing, etc. But as soon as we got the first offer letter, she checked out and became utterly useless. I'd recommend either paying one a fixed fee for marketing only (still contingent upon closing), or a 20-30% commission on the part of the price above what a passive MLS listing would easily sell the house for.

That was the only way to get anything done in hacking. No one took it personally. Charlene's crowd most definitely did take it personally. It wasn't being  told  that they were wrong that offended  them, though it was the underlying assumption that a person could be right or  wrong about anything... \n""Very well, let me put it this way,"" Kivistik said ""How many on ramps will connect the world's ghettos to the Information Superhighway?"" \nThe words came out of Randy's mouth before he had time to think better of it. ""The Information  Superhighway is just a fucking metaphor! Give me a break!"" he said. \n""That doesn't tell me very  much,"" Kivistik said.""Everything is a metaphor. The word 'fork' is a metaphor for this object."" He held up a fork. ""All discourse is built from metaphors."" \n""That's no excuse for using bad metaphors,"" Randy said. ""Bad? Bad?  Who decides what is bad?"" Kivistik said, doing his killer impression of  a heavy lidded, mouth breathing undergraduate. Randy could see where it was going. Kivistik had gone for the usual academician's ace in the hole: everything is relative, it's all just differing perspectives. People had already begun to resume their little side conversations, thinking that the conflict was over, when Randy gave them all a start with: \n""Who decides what's bad? I do."" \nEven Dr.G.E. B. Kivistik was flustered. He wasn't sure if Randy was joking. ""Excuse me?"" Randy was in no great hurry  to  answer the question. He took the opportunity to sit back comfortably, stretch, and take a sip of his wine. He was feeling good. ""It's like this,"" he said. ""I've read your book. I've seen you on TV. I've heard you tonight. I personally typed up a list of your credentials when I was preparing press materials for this conference. So I\nknow that you're not qualified to have an opinion about technical issues.'' \n""Oh,"" Kivistik said in mock confusion, ""I didn't realize one had to have qualifications."" \n""I think  it's clear,"" Randy said, ""that if you are ignorant of a particular subject, that your opinion is completely worthless. If I'm sick, I don't ask a plumber for advice. I  go to a doctor. Likewise, if I have questions about the Internet, I will seek opinions from people who know about it."" \n""Funny how all of the technocrats seem to be in favor of the Internet,"" Kivistik said cheerily, milking a few more laughs from the crowd. \n""You have just  made a statement that is demonstrably not true,"" Randy said, pleasantly enough. ""A number of Internet experts have written well reasoned books that are sharply critical of it."" Kivistik was finally getting pissed off. All the levity was gone. ""So,"" Randy  continued, ""to get back to where  we  started, the Information Superhighway is a bad metaphor for the Internet, because I say it is. There might be a thousand people on the planet who are as conversant with the Internet as I am. I know most of these people. None of them takes that metaphor seriously. Q.E.D."" ""Oh. I see,"" Kivistik said, a little hotly. He had seen an opening. ""So we should rely on the technocrats to tell us what to think, and how to think, about this technology."" The expressions of the others seemed to say that this was a telling blow, righteously struck. \n""I'm  not sure what  a technocrat is,"" Randy said. ""Am I a  technocrat? I'm  just a guy who went down to the bookstore and bought a couple of textbooks on TCP/IP, which is the underlying protocol of the Internet, and read them. And then I signed on to a computer, which anyone can do nowadays,\nand I messed around with it for a few years, and now I know all about it. Does that make me a technocrat?""",1352928660

People have gone to the moon without OO.  Whole banking systems have been run without OO.  OO has its place.  And, when applied correctly, it can be a lot of fun to work with.<p>Digging through one of the links in the posted article there's an article that suggests new programmers should be taught Python without the OO stuff. What? Crazy.<p>Every new programmer needs to start with C.  In fact, I am convinced that every new programmer needs to start with C and be tasked with writing an RTOS on a small memory-limited 8 bit processor. And then write several applications that run within that RTOS.<p>Then give them a budget of n clock cycles and m memory bytes and have them create a solution for a particular problem that barely fits within these constraints.<p>I would then expose them to Forth and ask that the re-write the same RTOS and applications.<p>Then I'd move them up to Lisp.<p>From there move into one of the OO languages.  My first OO language was C++, but I suppose today I might opt to teach someone Java or something like that.  Definitely not Objective-C.  Keep it simple.<p>The above progression will expose a new programmer to tons of really valuable ideas and approaches to solving problems.<p>Then I'd get serious and ask them to write something like a genetic solver on a workstation in all of these languages and optimize each solution for absolute top performance (generations per second) first and absolute minimal memory footprint as second batch.  Lots of invaluable lessons in that exercise.<p>Now you have a programmer that can identify which technology to use under what circumstance and for what reason.  This is a programmer who knows how to get a 100x or 1000x performance gain out of a piece of code or how to get something done 10x faster at the expense of raw performance.  Here's a programmer who understands exactly what is happening behind the code.<p>And, in the end the most important thing still is data representation.  You can make a program 100 times harder to write if you choose the wrong representation for the problem being solved.  Just like the first article points out:  search a small table and the ""hacker"" solution is almost trivial.",1352928122

Online courses tend to be by far not as rigorous as books are, but I took first part of Prof. Roughgarden's course and it was very enjoyable on all sides.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII</a> \n[2] <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2</a>",1352927215

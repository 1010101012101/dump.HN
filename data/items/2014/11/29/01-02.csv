But it&#x27;s not always that clear-cut. Particularly on laptops, if you diverge from the OEM-included drivers you can have issues. I had a Dell laptop that I obtained second-hand, and I reinstalled my employer&#x27;s stock Windows 7 ISO on it. It randomly blue-screened even with the latest appropriate graphics drivers, until I went back to the Dell website and found the exact version of the driver needed for that laptop.<p>FWIW OpenBSD, which I had installed on another partition, ran flawlessly with the exception of suspend/resume.

Market forces have a natural tendency for monopoly, which is why monopoly laws are needed in the first place. For example, oil companies and ISPs are all monopolies naturally formed.<p>Now, the IT companies may be different. As you say, the technology in this area advances so rapidly that a monopoly at one time soon becomes irrelevant at another time. Still a monopoly Microsoft is in the area of desktop operating system, but the power of such monopoly has faded away.<p>But I don&#x27;t think the European regulators would take this into account.",1417226329

It is attempting to unify a bunch of previously disconnected functionality into a single program. Typically unix is composed of small single-purpose utilities that perform a single function, rather than a giant monolithic blob of code (with obvious exceptions, like emacs).<p>2. Partially because it has been around for so long and has so much history, and partially because it follows a unix tradition of using plain text configuration and shell scripting to solve problems.<p>3. The systemd folks believe that sysv init isn&#x27;t capable of doing things that are important to modern systems (ex. dependencies between services, reacting to devices coming and going, intelligent daemon management, etc), and that doing those things correctly requires that an init system be &#x27;more&#x27; than people previously thought it needed to be. They are also very....confident in their ideas, and don&#x27;t hesitate to re-implement functionality (like logging) if it makes is easier to interoperate with their other code.<p>People opposed to systemd believe that it is too complex for such a critical piece of system functionality. They also resent the fact that systemd seems to require tight coupling to the rest of the system, and that it is aggressively pushing into so many linux systems. Many of them also probably have a long history with sysv init, and are comfortable with the way that it works. (Some portion also probably recall pulseaudio, which had similar grand visions, was similarly aggressively pushed into use before it was fully baked).<p>4.

By and large neither Windows or OSX users need to deal with low level OS stuff, whereas Linux users frequently do. These sorts of issues affect long time users and new users. From what I&#x27;ve seen, Linux users tend to either go straight to a mainstream distro, or distro hop for a while, get bored or frustrated with dealing with unnecessary complications, and end up on a mainstream distro as a result. At first you take pride in learning more, but after a while you just want something that works and gets out of your way.

That&#x27;s pretty sad.<p>Actually, if you read the announcement or any of the home page materials -- much less look at the tour or demo -- you would immediately notice many major substantive new technologies. See my response to Jonathan above.<p>> A Spoon &quot;image&quot; is just a Windows executable,<p>While Spoon Studio does support deployment as a standalone Windows EXE, in Spoon containers, images are stored in a local container database. This supports deduplication, delta storage, journaling / commit / rollback, continuation, and other container-specific functionality. In addition, Spoon containers implement a differential synchronization protocol that allows efficient migration of container state between endpoints and the hub and back again over high-latency networks.<p>> Spoon is really decent technology, which has worked very great for very many years now (well before Docker even existed), even though it&#x27;s been pretty niche among geeks.<p>Thank you! Yes, the underlying VM engine has been around quite a while and is a proven system. And yes, we&#x27;ve been doing this long before Docker existed. To their credit, Docker did popularize the term &quot;containers&quot;, which is a much better term than &quot;app virtualization&quot; in my view. And building on LXC provided Docker a dynamic packaging model (&quot;go through install steps on this clean virtual machine&quot;) rather than the &quot;static&quot; packaging model previously used by App-V, ThinApp, and Spoon Studio (&quot;install on a machine and take snapshots&quot; or &quot;tell us what files/config you want&quot;). Now, as it happens, we&#x27;ve had dynamic configuration on our roadmap for some time, and it just so happened that our efforts there reached fruition around the same time Docker came on the scene. In any event, Spoon containers are here now and we expect it will make Spoon technology accessible to a much larger audience.<p>I don&#x27;t think however that a product with a multi-million desktop install base over 10,000+ organizations quite qualifies as &quot;niche&quot; (<a href=""https://spoon.net/customers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spoon.net/customers</a>). Over 280,000 paid enterprise seats migrated from ThinApp to Spoon last year. And with the new Spoon containers, I feel the next year holds significant promise.<p>> It should also be interesting to HN how Spoon, the company, has managed to pivot its way through a changing landscape and different hypes.<p>Backstory on this: Spoon has actually moved sequentially pursuing a single vision for most of its existence, stopping to release specific products addressing specific problems along the way -- a time-consuming yet ultimately helpful constraint allowing us to avoid the use of any venture capital. (I will admit to a brief tangential flirtation with the game industry and some other poor decisions.) Along the way, the industry has independently pivoted around our project trajectory through the various hype cycles. We were building &quot;app virtualization&quot; before the term existed, and now &quot;containers&quot; before that term existed. I&#x27;m legitimately curious whether it will keep up with our next technology cycle!",1417224981

Try to read a few of them and leave the rest for later - just keep at it.<p>3) Follow the code<p>Take a look at each code change made to the project, try to understand it even if it&#x27;s over your head.<p>4) Run it!<p>Changes were made? Pull them in, run them.<p>5) Poke around<p>Try introducing your own changes. Hit a bug? Try to trace it down as much as you can & fix it. If you can&#x27;t fix it, report it upstream.<p>6) Make your own<p>You want it to do more? Add it, or at least give it a good try.<p>Don&#x27;t know how? Still try!

The downside is it fragments the finite development efforts of the contributors to the point where it becomes difficult to compete with the wider marketplace. I wonder sometimes if it were possible for everyone to contribute to one linux desktop if the situation would be different today.<p>As it stands, after nearly three years using ubuntu desktop, I came to the conclusion that a windows license is very cheap by comparison. The amount of time and effort I spent wasted on package incompatibilities, instabilities, and debugging strange hardware/driver related issues isn&#x27;t worth it. I keep linux in a VM where it&#x27;s very easy and cheap to backup and rollback without affecting my data or ability to work. I really gave it a good try, and I liked a lot of things about the freedom to configure things like I want, without metro crapware infesting the place, but the downsides were just too much for me.<p>Again I wonder how things could have been if everyone was pulling as a coherent team instead of in different directions.",1417222941

The first would be using cloud instances or even the third-party Twitter clients themselves to distributively spider or scrape Twitter constantly and provide a third-party ""stream"" or unofficial index.<p>b] If it's just the user's timeline the client wants to access, this can just be done through any HTTP connection as long as the library is up-to-date enough to properly decode the HTML and DOM elements into the previously readily available JSON elements.<p>Although the API is a convenience, it almost seems like a non-issue to access content that is publicly available or available when the user logs in if the user is willing to hand over their credentials.

Roughly 50% of that group (or 25% of the total working population) have a college degree.<p>> The right metric is to look at percentage unemployment in each of these segments<p>I would take it even further and break up the high school or less demographic. Someone who could obtain a degree, but chose not to/was unable to attend college is not at all like someone who has no chance of graduating no matter what the circumstances. They really shouldn't be lumped together if we are trying to promote the business benefits of attending college.<p>If you have the opportunity to go to college, you have already demonstrated characteristics that are appealing to employers that are not present in the rest of the demographic. Due to the presentation, it is not clear in any way if college actually add any additional value or if those people would have achieved the same results regardless.",1345184722

So even if the buffer flip times are still too slow for you to get completely smooth scrolling in complex demos like this -- and that makes sense, given your large-screen setup -- you'll hopefully still benefit some from the faster, non-browser-freezing relayouts.",1345183649

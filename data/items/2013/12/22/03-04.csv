6949281,comment,6948807,6949147,2,0,derleth,,,"I think that&#x27;s a bad example, because your TryParse function can be thought of as returning a value wrapped in a monad. A Maybe monad, to be specific. In Haskell:<p><pre><code>    case (tryParse s) of \n      Just n -> putStrLn &quot;Parsed &quot; ++ (show n)\n      Nothing -> putStrLn (s ++ &quot; was not an integer&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nNothing is a very convenient little concept: It&#x27;s a value which isn&#x27;t a &#x27;legitimate&#x27; value in any context. It&#x27;s always a flag value. In C, for example, there&#x27;s no way to have a flag value of type int in this context, because tryParse could conceivably return any value of type int as its legitimate result. It&#x27;s also wonderfully conceptually clean: The function either just returns a legitimate value or it returns nothing legitimate at all, and you always know which it did. The point is, however, it only returns <i>one</i> value, and doesn&#x27;t rely on any out-of-band communications through errno or similar.<p>If you want to get fancy, you can use the Either monad. This can allow you to say <i>why</i> a parse failed, for example:<p><pre><code>    case (tryParse s) of\n      Left n -> putStrLn &quot;Parsed &quot; ++ (show n)\n      Right m -> putStrLn &quot;Parse of &quot; ++ s ++ &quot; failed because &quot; ++ m\n</code></pre>\nIn this case, tryParse would have the type:<p><pre><code>    tryParse :: String -> Either Int String\n</code></pre>\nThe point here is, you still only return one value, but they can be either of two different <i>kinds</i> of value, as distinguished by being tagged either Left or Right, and can even be different types. Again, one value, no out-of-band signalling.<p>And, of course, Haskell has tuples. You can do interesting things without them, however.",1387684770

Now we all know all too well that we do.<p>As the scandal unravels the government are clinging to the &#x27;terrorism&#x27; fig leaf. They haven&#x27;t got anything else, no other plausible excuse for what they have been up to. Nobody has completely seen through it yet, or, if they have then they haven&#x27;t shared with the rest of the world exactly what it is that they are hiding. (There is something else going on, the &#x27;al-qaeda&#x27; thing is just a ruse, however nobody really believes that it is a complete, total, utter sham of emptiness. We aren&#x27;t there yet...)<p>They are going to have to squirm for a little bit longer before the grand reveal. Exactly who steps up to do this is not known, however, there are plenty of candidates out there, getting bolder by the day. One thing is for certain though, that grand reveal will happen and, when it does, this NSA spying lark will be put into perspective. That perspective will show the spying story so far to be nothing more than an appetizing &#x27;light snack&#x27; before the immensely satisfying main course. Compared to what we have got coming the fall of the Berlin Wall was nothing!<p>Anyone care to guess what the ace is that trumps the government&#x27;s &#x27;terrorism&#x27; card?

If those same public cameras were extracted from ceilings and placed on extremely conspicuous tripods sitting on the ground, I bet people would feel less comfortable, despite little having changed.<p>Reminds me of the guy who got kicked out of the Seattle restaurant a few weeks ago for refusing to remove Glass. The restaurant said it didn&#x27;t want to open its customers up to the possibility of being recorded without their consent. Of course, on the restaurant&#x27;s very own Facebook page were numerous shots of customers dining, many of which were obtained without any knowledge or consent. The hypocrisy was lost on them, unfortunately.<p>People underemphasize form and overemphasize function.<p>When it comes down to it, most of us are being photographed all the time. Exponentially more-so today than anyone was 100 years ago. And with the rise of smartphones, substantially more-so today than anyone was even 10 years ago. Smart glasses are merely another rung on the ladder. Every argument you make could have been made for smartphones as well.",1387684684

6949271,comment,6948506,6949201,1,0,obstacle1,,,"> I do not think that the experience suggests that more capitalism is the way to go<p>The point is if you&#x27;re looking at The Real World, there&#x27;s <i>no</i> evidence -- pro or con -- for or against a free market system. We&#x27;ve never experienced one. Regulated markets aren&#x27;t in any sense comparable to an actual free market.<p>Even the <i>smallest</i> regulation in a free market system makes it an entirely different beast. For example if you decide to impose a tariff on a <i>single</i> industry in an economy, that alone will result in massive inefficiency -- and as a result, wealth disparity -- such that the system can&#x27;t meaningfully be called a &#x27;free market&#x27;. At all. It&#x27;s just a regulated market economy, like we currently have.<p>Hence you can&#x27;t take mixed economies with varying degrees of &#x27;free-marketness&#x27; and infer from those how actual free markets will work.<p>There&#x27;s the question of whether implementing free markets is even possible. It would certainly take a lot of barricading of human behavior from the market -- is that achievable? I don&#x27;t know.<p>But the point is <i>we&#x27;ve never tried it</i>, so why not try it before we shoot it down?<p>>contrary to experience<p>The only experience we have is of regulated markets. There&#x27;s no &quot;contrary to experience&quot; to ascribe to free markets, <i>because we&#x27;ve never experienced free markets</i>.<p>We&#x27;ve theorized free markets. Again, models we&#x27;ve built say free markets would likely be extremely efficient and beneficial for all of us.<p>But we&#x27;ve never seen, empirically, free market anything. As stated above, a mixed economy -- even one that&#x27;s, like, 99% &#x27;free&#x27; or whatever -- isn&#x27;t at all comparable to a true free market. The smallest of tamperings with a true free market turns it into a completely different beast, when we&#x27;re looking at things whole-economy scale.<p>>So the OP&#x27;s argument seems to be, if we just deregulate even more, then - contrary to experience - we get a better system<p>In sum, OP&#x27;s argument isn&#x27;t that we should &#x27;deregulate even more&#x27;. It&#x27;s that <i>we&#x27;ve never seen a free market, but should try one</i>. Trying a true free market isn&#x27;t a matter of &#x27;deregulating <i>more</i>&#x27;, it&#x27;s a matter of deregulating <i>entirely</i>. Blank slate, start again.",1387684600

It doesn&#x27;t make sense to create another prefix for domains (actually, many more prefixes for domains, since I imagine this won&#x27;t just apply to com).

6949258,comment,6942905,6948688,4,0,coolsunglasses,,,"Considering the alternative in the Java ecosystem where none of the IDE tooling is reusable, it seems okay to me. The basic stdout-oriented nature of it means virtually any language/editor/stack can make use of it.<p>That it&#x27;s a command-line application also means it&#x27;s &quot;start up and throw away&quot; which is easier to get working for most users than daemon based stuff.

This is also true of Joy and RPL and other languages which are conceptually organized around mutating a (notional) stack.

Just wanted to explain that the intentions were good: to correct bad &quot;random&quot; on the client side.<p>From this point on nonce will always be set to 0, and next we will definitely remove it from our diagram and explanations in the docs.<p>The author definitely deserves a prize, please enquire at the following email for details.<p><i></i>W_K<i></i><p><i>Товарищ прав — похоже, сервер в принципе может с помощью манипуляции с nonce выполнить MiTM на DH между клиентами. Не знаю, кто именно внедрил этот nonce в такой форме, хотя и знаю, какое предъявлялось обоснование — он был нужен для того, чтобы защититься от слабого рандома на клиентах, которых в принципе может писать кто угодно. Очевидно, нужно сделать этот nonce нулём и написать, что клиенты впредь не должны принимать секретные чаты с ненулевым nonce.<p>Удивительно, что человек, называющий себя «чайником» в криптографии, нашёл действительно серьёзный недостаток протокола, в отличие от многих якобы «профессионалов», постоянно придирающихся не по существу.<p>Не знаю как насчёт 200k$ — расшифровать трафик это не поможет, а сервер не знает ключа от секретного чата, поскольку на нём нет такой закладки. Но мне очень не нравится, что в будущем такая закладка могла бы быть в принципе кем-нибудь добавлена.<p>Тем не менее, считаю, за это ценное наблюдение Вам положен ценный приз. Пусть и не такой большой.\nЕсли Вы или кто-либо ещё найдёт какие-либо ещё потенциальные дыры в протоколе — сообщайте, будем награждать.</i><p>Translation:<p>He is correct, looks like the server can manipulate nonce and succeed at MiTM on DH between the clients. Not sure who&#x27;s idea it was to introduce that nonce in this form, but I do understand the motivation, to protect against the &quot;weak random&quot; on the clients that can in theory be written by anyone. Obviously, we need to make nonce=0 and refuse secret chats with non-zero nonce.<p>It is quite amazing that the man who calls himself &quot;a crypto noob&quot; found a real vulnerability, as opposed to all those so-called professionals whose criticisms were largely unfounded.<p>Not sure about the $200k since this vulnerability won&#x27;t really help to decipher the traffic and the server doesn&#x27;t know the key from the secret chat, because it doesn&#x27;t have any &quot;bookmark&quot;. But I really don&#x27;t like that in the future such a bookmark could be added.<p>However, I think this is a valuable observation and you do deserve a prize, even if not such a big one.

Also you mentioned something about exchanges talking to central banks which isn&#x27;t something that happens. Your fictional example is:<p><i>I&#x27;ve got 150,000BTC, please convert that into dollars for me at the market rate. What? No worries I&#x27;ll just wait here. You can wire the dollars to this account here ...</i><p>That isn&#x27;t the kind of thing you do at the teller window. That kind of liquidity doesn&#x27;t exist in bitcoin (though it would be a cinch in other major currencies).

The exchange matches buyers and sellers at a price they can both agree on. If there are no buyers for what you are trying to sell, that&#x27;s too bad but it isn&#x27;t the exchange&#x27;s problem.

It costs him X to register.<p>- Bob wants to set up his personal site, and 3 hobby sites. It costs him X + 2X + 4X + 8X = 15X or (2^4 - 1)X.<p>- Carl the domain squatter wants to register 100 domains. It costs him (2^100 - 1)X. This could be defeated by changing Carl&#x27;s business name, or other details, which creates extra hassles for him.<p><i>Edit: Didn&#x27;t know that registering new accounts is near 0 effort.

Both General Dynamics and Reynolds were contracts cases. There was no allegation that the government was exceeding the scope of its domestic powers. Dismissing a case on state secrets grounds has a separation of powers implication when the government invokes the privilege in the face of allegedly unconstitutional activity than when it invokes it in a contractual dispute. Historically, the courts have given much more scrutiny to claims of national security privileges when such claims prevent them from reviewing Constitutional questions.

If an analogy helps you, think about how music piracy ended up giving us Spotify, and how it had to come from Europe to break into the US market, and how it blocked Americans to avoid getting shut down in its early days. Or, think about how Jobs essentially tricked the labels into allowing iTunes. The traditional record label publishing model is analogous to the FDA&#x27;s drug trial model. The FDA can make any number of arguments about how their method is more rigorous and beneficial, but at some point, newer methods of getting similar results are coming along, and at some point after that, those methods will be backed by a power with the resources and inclination to bring the benefits of rigor to the new methods without resorting to the old methods.",1423799478

Because I&#x27;m having a hard time coming up with the 60 dollars per hour or more figure.  Lets say you slow down the video (using one of the techniques that doesn&#x27;t alter the audio pitch), so that it matches your typing speed.  Then you can transcribe it in &quot;real time&quot; (i.e., without having to stop, back up, and restart the audio).  And it would easy to have the software record timing information (if the transcription is done real time).<p>So slowing down the video to half speed, means a half hour video takes an hour to transcribe.  At a labor cost of $15.00 per hour, that is 25 cents/minute of video.  Much less if it is off shored.<p>Edit: Would it be helpful if Google added a captioning interface to YouTube?  That is, an adjustable playback speed (which they have now, but I&#x27;d like to see more speed levels), and a capture window where users (volunteers) could provide captioning of any video, including educational ones.",1423798890

Decided to give it a few day to see if \nthe intense daily anxiety would get a little bit better. It didn&#x27;t.<p>A couple of weeks later I found a therapist.  Great--He will \nhelp me.  Well, I was seeing him two times a week for months.  I paid \nhis fees through what was left of my student loans.  Months \nwent by.  I cried, and cried.  We talked about my childhood.\nI went to a Behaviorist--followed his instructions--still nothing.  Finally was referred to a Psychatrist--who didn&#x27;t \nseem to have a clue to what was wrong with me.  Finally, on my last referal I found a Psychiatrist who at least acted like he knew what was going on.  Yes, he did prescribe \na addictive drug, after trying most of the non addictive drugs.  In my case, Klonopin is the only drug that seemed to \nalleviate my misery, but it was not enough;  I still needed to self medicate.  More importantly, this Psychiatrist reassured me that the crazy thoughts I was having was \nnothing to worry about.  It was the way he told me--I could \nsee in his face that he has heard my symptomology before, and \nI was not going crazy.  That was priceless!<p>I can say anxiety ruined the life I was preparing for, but my anxiety symptoms eventually got better over the years.  I look back on the Therapy and I sometimes think it did more damage than good?  I really was honest in Therapy, and so \nwanted it to work, but I got nothing out of it in the slightest?<p>I don&#x27;t have any advise because every patient is \ndifferent.  I can offer this, if you go on an addicive drug keep the level of medication low.  You might be suprised just how long you will live?

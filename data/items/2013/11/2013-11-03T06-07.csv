This made proceeding with litigation essentially futile: the introduction of prohibitive travel expenses, transition to the wildly different procedural and evidentiary standards of federal court, and an award sum (if any) a fraction of the original claim amount.<p>The best and perhaps most ironic part, however, was that the plaintiffs who did proceed would have the comfort of knowing that the defense attorneys assigned to destroy what remained of them and their product liability tort would be directly financed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.<p>If anyone wants further reading, I recommend Steve Jakubowski&#x27;s blog posts on the subject. They mostly chronicle his arguments before the bankruptcy court concerning successorship liability issues at the time, but he also does a really good job of putting a human face on the matter.[3]<p>1. <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/15/news/companies/auto_bankruptcy_plaintiffs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/15/news/companies/auto_bankrupt...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gm-to-cover-future-liability-claims-reports"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gm-to-cover-future-liabilit...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.bankruptcylitigationblog.com/archives/bankruptcy-in-the-news-voyage-of-the-damned-the-gm-tort-claimants-opening-appellate-brief-brother-can-you-spare-a-quarter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bankruptcylitigationblog.com/archives/bankruptcy-...</a>",1383460776

6662408,comment,6662301,6662301,4,0,droopyEyelids,,,"What a concept. I think my mind just blew.<p>I have no insight into whether women want this, but if they&#x27;re amenable to the idea, imagine what the marketing engine behind something like the Susan G Komen foundation mixed with the home security industry could do with this.<p>Already, home security advertisements imply that you should buy their product if you don&#x27;t want your wife to be raped. What if that could be extended to people&#x27;s feeling of compassion for women in general? Imagine how much would be donated to buy these for Indian women after a rape scandal.<p>I always assume a company out to make money will eventually blur the lines of morality like that, but the complication comes from this device&#x27;s implication that women are responsible for not being raped. I think people will be seriously, seriously fucked up by the fact that this thing exists. If someone is raped, how will she handle the idea that if she spent the money she could have prevented it? How will parents feel if the worst happens and they didn&#x27;t buy this for their daughter? How will they feel if they <i>did</i> buy it but she wasn&#x27;t wearing it? What about people who can&#x27;t afford it? Think about what <i>that</i> could do to your self image! Or even worse, this only looks like it&#x27;d work on a woman who has a narrower waist than hips.<p>I can also see legal trouble. What about the first lawsuit against a college/concert venue/etc for bringing people together without providing these? What about someone claiming indemnity <i>for</i> providing them in an otherwise unsafe environment? And that&#x27;s not even getting into the skydiving disclaimer the company selling &#x27;em would have to use.<p>This has to be the craziest thing ever brought to market. I guess what I see happening is another pink ribbon, ostensibly nonprofit. I actually hope that happens, except this time the people behind it set an example of using 99% of funds to make the device cheap and widely distributed instead of &#x27;losing&#x27; 80% of the money to &#x27;administrative costs&#x27;.. though that still leaves the manufacturers and material suppliers in a morally complicated position wrt profits.",1383459277

(unless the installer does it for you... which is variably on Windows platform).<p>The culture of Windows platform unfortunately dictates you how to use Windows as an OS.<p>Now let&#x27;s go to Development Code type of dependencies (we&#x27;re talking about libraries and stuffs here).<p>NuGet has reached the &quot;accepted&quot; level of dependency management _recently_ (for a while in the past, it couldn&#x27;t download the Source Code as well. Maven, RubyGems, and others can) while other platforms have dependency management for years _and_ integrated to developer daily workflow.<p>What about scripting the build for .NET type of development? I don&#x27;t know the exact number but I still see people not using MSBuild (or even know what it is) or NAnt.<p>Most Java IDEs would generate build.xml for your project and would provide you hints that you should be using that instead of &quot;Build Project&quot; (or perhaps the &quot;Build Project&quot; is tied to Ant, by default).<p>Besides, both MSBuild and NAnt are painful compare to Maven, lots of boilerplate stuff to setup.<p>What about Continuous Integration and Deployment? Microsoft didn&#x27;t build one for a while (not sure if they&#x27;ve built one and baked it into TFS) and y&#x27;all have to rely on CruiseControl or TeamCity or Bamboo or something else.<p>I recently interviewed a senior .NET developer who said to me that he deploy his ASP.NET project from VS.NET IDE (like y&#x27;know... hitting F5 or something) to the Production server!<p>Let&#x27;s take it a little bit further: Docker and Vagrant are useful tools for automation testing. Docker doesn&#x27;t exist in Windows. Preparing Vagrant for Windows require you to have licenses and probably you have to figure out how to script software installation (you could cheat a little bit by preparing a Windows OS + a base software installed). Compare that to Ubuntu on Vagrant: breezy.<p>I think the pattern is rather quite obvious: Microsoft/.NET community has always been behind everybody else.<p>At the end of the day: you cannot automate the process of calling a Sales person in order to get the software, which, in the F/OSS world, such workflow doesn&#x27;t exist.",1383458471

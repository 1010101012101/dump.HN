114491,comment,114198,114390,0,0,Electro,,,"At about 16, when I first got a gig writing reviews I decided TV took up too much time. At that point I simply pulled the cable out the back of the thing and just continued to use it to review games.<p>Now I simply don't have a TV, I still own one but it's in storage. I have a small problem with DVD's, but mostly because it's rather boring eating alone, and I barely play games on my PC anymore since reviewing them made pretty much 90% of games detestable. I literally had to force myself to play through Metalheart: Replicants Rampage, description claimed it was like a new Fallout; I believe they mixed up the game with the feeling of ""Oh dear god, that pain is my life draining away"" of radiation poisoning.<p>Now I have so much time without TV that I'm going to blitz out a novel I've been working on over the next couple of weeks. It's been a while since I tried to get anything published, so its about time I _did_ get something published.",1202863114

Suddenly TV doesn't seem very important.<p>If you want to use the pseudo-nicotine-patch method of weaning yourself from TV, do the above and download your current shows off the internet and watch them at your convenience. Eventually those shows will die off, and since you don't have cable/satellite, you won't have any new ones to replace them.",1202862888
114486,comment,113473,113871,0,0,tx,,,"I agree, in-memory hash table controlled manually by the application has a million ways to beat any SQL-server caching.<p>What I am saying is that <i>I suspect that memcached is way overused by people who don't know much about SQL</i>. I am not posing like a DB snob, in fact my skills are fairly modest, but even I know that query caching is just one of the many caches SQL servers employ, and well designed servers easily service thousand+ of requests per second. And that's just one instnace.<p>Very very very few web sites ever reach such loads. In theory memcached should be more like a very niche product for such rare sites, yet it appears that everybody is using it.<p>I am against it because it increases the complexity. Memcached deployment and cache control become two more things to get right.<p>That's all.",1202862822

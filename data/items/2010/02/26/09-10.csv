1152837,comment,1151596,1151757,0,0,tybris,,,"> Imagine what Amazon could have done if they had Research budget of Microsoft of Google.<p>I find that hard since much of Amazon's business culture and innovation comes out of frugality. Being a low margin business, Amazon had to become so streamlined that it does not suffer from the expensive maintenance drag. The great strength of Amazon is its ability to evolve. They're a population of tiny businesses/services rather than one single entity. You'll see the rate of innovation at Amazon is speeding up over time, rather than slowing down.",1267178308
1152834,comment,1151804,1152363,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I think projects of that age (18 years?) and size (~10M LOC?) which are still so much in flux are rare. Of course, Linux has a gigantic number of people working on it, and a large part of the codebase is hardware drivers - and a lot of new hardware is released all the time. In that light, the graphs aren't overly surprising, but I can't think of a comparable project.",1267178057

Still, it sounds like fun.<p>I started coding the exercise, my first approach would have been a clustering algorithm. For various reasons I decided to write my own (though with a standard algorithm) and didn't have enough spare time to debug it properly. Should have just used an existing package...

It was all a bit over my head but after about a week I was drawing some Mario-inspired shapes on the screen. The next big push came when I taught myself to do early CGI-based stuff: it was just so exciting to be able to share something with dozens (!) of people. If you define being good as ""being able to pick up a new language in a few days"" then yeah, I guess I'm good & I think that's a goal well worth pursuing. Picking up a new language will expose yourself to new constructs & practises, it trains your programming muscle. If you define good as ""expert at programming task X"" then, sadly, I am not very good. The best part about programming is that you never stop learning. That uncle of mine is now well into retirement and he's still programming microcontrollers for fun.",1267176256

5605893,comment,5605739,5605739,25,0,richardjordan,,,"One of my old Physics teachers was an expert on Stone Henge.  Did a lot of original research in the 1980s.   From what I recall Stone Henge is actually multiple sites on top of each other, so when someone says ""this is what Stone Henge was for"" I am skeptical because we're talking an enormous span of time and several re-buildings with no guarantee that all were for the same reason.<p>This article title is slightly misleading.  The migration route of Aurochs theory certainly gives an explanation as to why ancient people gathered in this location.  But it doesn't give reason for why the specific structures at Stone Henge were built, as people might assume from the title.<p>What I recall from my old teacher, and his work, was that you can pretty clearly demonstrate that the structures were there for observing the sun cycles, as was typical of many megalithic monuments - sun & moon cycles.  Most of the other claimed observations can be explained away as statistical artifacts.  Given the evidence of burial and the fact such observations would have had religious significance I haven't seen much to challenge the existing understanding of the site.<p>As an aside, I have visited many megalithic sites in the British Isles (many years go).  I find them fascinating.  One thing that people often remark on is how they're often in the middle of nowhere, but when they were built they were often in clearings in dense forests, but over time as we domesticated animals that would feed on the bark, killing the trees, then eat the new shoots, over many centuries - millennia - we deforested, for example the moors, and the megalithic sites became elegant monuments to a forgotten age, standing proud against a bleak landscape.",1366869025

To build efficient backends you need an incredibly difficult to achieve mix of knowledge that I won't even bother to enumerate.<p>We also have to analyse terabytes of logs daily.

5605861,comment,5603552,5605742,1,0,roryokane,,,"Heres an example of powerful customization. I recently wrote a macro in Vim that, when run in a particular Visual Basic file, would search for a certain part of the file with an SQL string, delete everything in the file but the SQL string (just temporarily), and reformat the SQL string for easy viewing. I needed a macro because that Visual Basic file was compiled from another source, so it kept getting rebuilt to the full version but with different SQL, and I had to keep on using my macro to view the new SQL.<p>The main reason this was easier in Vim than it would be in Sublime Text is that I could edit the macro after the fact the macro was just text. All macros are stored in a register, and registers are basically like multiple clipboards, so to edit the macro, I just had to paste the contents, change the text, and copy it back to the same register. Because of that, I could develop the macro bit by bit. At first, I just made the macro delete the parts of the file other than the string with SQL. Then, when I realized that I was going to be viewing the SQL in this file many more times, I edited the macros register. I was able to develop the macro bit by bit. And I could even save the macro in a text file for me to load later. Basically, I used Vim macros as a substitute for a scripting language  Vim has convenient text-manipulation functions built-in, and text manipulation and viewing were my goals.<p>Another way Vim made writing the macro easier is that it has more powerful macro primitives. It is easier to, for instance, select all the text in the next quoted string on this line, because Vims text-manipulation primitives are more granular. I think Sublime Text can select the cursors current block, but not a double-quoted string specifically.<p>Heres the final macro (^M carriage return characters were turned into actual newlines, and ^[ and ^V characters are invisible):<p><pre><code>    /History Section goes here

These probabilities are obtained from a sufficiently general training set, such as Google's n-gram viewer[1]. You can estimate the probability of a particular sequence of words by summing the log probabilities of each n-gram within that sequence. Using a trigram language model (n = 3), you could estimate the likelihood as follows:<p>Sentence = ""This sentence is semantically and syntactically valid.""<p>P(Sentence) = log(p(START,START,This)) + log(p(START,This,sentence)) + log(p(This,sentence,is)) + log(p(sentence,is,semantically)) + log(p(is,semantically,and)) + log(p(semantically,and,syntactically)) + log(p(and,syntactically,valid)) + log(p(syntactically,valid,.)) + log(p(valid,.,STOP)) + log(p(.,STOP,STOP))<p>where START and STOP are special symbols that aid in determining the proximity of a word to the beginning and end of a sentence.<p>If your training set fails to sufficiently generalize, you could use Bayesian inference to estimate the likelihood that the sentence is spam. Under this framework, you'd be calculating the posterior probability of the sentence being spam given the observed sequence of n-grams, which combines (i) the inherent likelihood that any sequence of words is spam and (ii) the compatibility of an observed sequence with (i), which is proportional to the impact it has on (i).<p>[1] <a href=""http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2....</a>",1366868028

students went to Cornell is no doubt recent and not
at all what I am talking about.<p>If you will read what I wrote, then you will see that
there were students from India in a US Midwestern
university.  They were not wealthy.  And at the time
there's no way they could have been paying their way.
Net, in US universities, even in undergraduate
programs, a major fraction of STEM students were
from foreign countries, especially India and Taiwan.
In simple terms, they were on scholarships of various
kinds.<p>Further, again, yet again, this time just for you,
over again, no student in a well known college or
university pays the full cost.  Rarely do they pay
more than 1/3rd.  E.g., as I have already posted 
in this thread, Mike Bloomberg gave $100 million to
Johns Hopkins, and a founder QUALCOMM recently
gave $133 million to the Cornell technical university
being built on Roosevelt Island, and this story is
standard all across US colleges and universities.
At a research university, expect that a professor
will get about $500,000 a year from NSF, NIH, etc.
About 60%, 300,000, will go to the university as
'overhead'.  The remaining $200,000 will cover
the professor's salary, travel, equipment,
supplies, etc.  And a little will go for 
graduate students.  So, again it's Joe and Mary
paying for the university.<p>Net, students don't pay the full cost.  Instead the
full cost is paid by gifts and taxes, taxes, e.g.,
for Joe and Mary who are still having a tough time
paying for their own children to go to college.  Some
of the taxes go quite directly to the institutions, e.g.,
all the state schools in NY, MD, CA, the Big Ten, etc.  A lot more
money goes from tax payers to the universities via
NSF and NIH.<p>You mentioned DARPA:  There were old rules
that the US DoD could not fund work at universities.
Long much DARPA (ARPA) work was so 'confidential' that
it could not be done in universities.  But clearly, e.g.,
with some of the DARPA Challenge projects, e.g., at CMU
and Stanford, some DARPA funding is making its way into
universities.  Still I doubt that a major fraction of
DARPA money goes to universities.<p>Yes, the situation of the NSF flooding the US 
with foreign STEM students is more extreme
in graduate programs.  But the NSF money that
goes to students is not really because the 
research projects need the student's labor!
No, the money is because the NSF demands that
students be supported because the NSF wants
to flood the US labor markets with STEM
students with graduate degrees.  Maybe you
believe that you worked hard for your
research assistantship, but, really, the NSF,
NIH, etc. mostly just want you to add to the
US STEM worker pool to keep down costs to
US industry and the US 'military-industrial'
complex.",1366866823

2. Qualified White applicants outnumber qualified Asian applicants.<p>If you concede (1), then your point that Asians get treated more harshly because they're majority is moot.

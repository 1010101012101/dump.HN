1892110,story,,,2,0,ebun,"Ask HN: Internationalizing your App and facing cultural challenges?",,"A question for those who have chosen to add internationalization to their apps:<p>When did you decide to internationalize your app and what led to your decision? Was it a matter of watching analytics and seeing a spike in people coming from new countries that didn't speak English? Or was it more of an effort to reach new markets?<p>Also, what, if any, cultural challenges did you face beyond adding new language support? For example, I live in Japan and when Twitter was aggressively pursuing the Japanese market, they found that people here didn't use SMS (everyone's phone has email), so they changed things up a bit. And though Facebook is aggressively expanding in the land of the rising sun (recently announced a Mixi--a top Japanese SN--data exporter), their attitude towards privacy might be a big deal breaker amongst a lot of potential Japanese users.<p>What has been your experience?",1289429969

Said that the division between easy of use and performance, dynamic interpreted vs static compiled was not caused by technical problems, just dumb luck. People that made up dynamic languages weren't interested in performance, didn't design around it.<p>Maybe now they're perpetuating the same division in syntax. System language syntax is weird, machine looking, dynamic language syntax reads more like English. Doesn't have to be that way, but it would be the system guy's preference. So I was thinking if the dynamic language camp used to Python's syntax took up Go, maybe it would be changed for their taste.<p>The channel <- syntax is crazy.

1892085,comment,1891753,1892015,0,0,bradleyland,,,"The additive color model isn't exactly the same as the layer modes you'll see in image editing apps. This ""mode"" affects how the values of the current layer are applied to the layers below it. The normal mode is to replace the values below. When you switch to additive, the RGB channels from the current layer are ""added"" to the values of the layer below. This is entirely different than the concept of the additive color model.<p>There are two broad color model types: additive and subtractive. Additive color models (like RGB) ""add"" color to arrive at white. Subtractive color models (like CMYK) ""subtract"" color to arrive at white. In the RGB additive color model, we most frequently refer to the primary colors, RGB, but the secondary colors (cyan, magenta, and yellow) are equally important. The primary colors are the result of raising only one channel to full luminance while all the others are at zero. The secondary colors are produced by raising all channels to the maximum, then dropping one channel to zero. The secondary color for the blue channel is yellow.<p>The consequence of this is that you can't simply pixelate the blue channel in an additive model RGB image and claim this proves a lack of ability to perceive color in the blue light spectrum, because the alteration of the primary color will inevitably affect the distribution of the secondary color, depending upon the luminance of the other channels in the region.<p>A better test would display a test pattern in different colors, but matching luminosity. The trouble with testing this on your computer is that your display must be calibrated. On a properly calibrated display, the display of RGB[0,255,0] and RGB[0,0,255] should have identical luminance values. Very few people have calibrated displays, and even if you do, the chances that your display is accurate throughout the color gamut for a given luminance value is even less.",1289429366

1891951,comment,1891753,1891753,0,0,bradleyland,,,"Ugh. We don't have an entirely clear picture of how our eyes physically detect color, much less how we perceive it, but there are serious problems with the argument the author makes here. You cannot simply take a color photograph of a scene, split it in to three channels, then point out that the blue channel is ""dark and contains less detail"" as evidence of our inability to perceive the color blue. The fact is that the blue channel really <i>is</i> darker because of the actual lack of blue light in the photo.<p>The trick here is that the areas that have a lot of detail (her face, for example) contain less blue. If you use a color meter to inspect the areas around the girls face, you'll find that there is less blue light present. That makes sense, considering that our skin doesn't contain a lot of blue pigment. This fact is exacerbated by the fact that the author overlaps the channel samples in a way that places emphasis on the areas impacted the most.<p>Basically, the author fails to understand the additive color model. We don't notice the pixelation of the blue channel in this photo because the result of the alteration is to introduce a low-contrast color in to the photo where the aberration overlaps: yellow. If you look closely, you'll see that the areas where you see cyan and magenta in the red and green channels are replaced by yellow in the corresponding blue channel alteration. The effects are diminished by two factors: there isn't much blue luminance present to influence the other colors, and yellow contrasts poorly with most of the colors in the photo where we notice it (the hood is white).<p>If you were to take a color-neutral photograph and split out the RGB channels, you'd perceive the same level of detail in all channels.<p>EDIT: I'd kind of like to take back that last statement about perceiving the same level of detail in all channels. I don't know that you would, but that's not the primary thing that bugs me about the author's argument. My main point is that his argument is flawed, not his assertion. I don't know enough about human color perception to make that argument.",1289426503

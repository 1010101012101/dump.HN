I&#x27;ve worked for a couple &quot;limousine liberals&quot; in New York. So has my wife and so have many of my friends. Many of the limousine liberals are assholes (not that he&#x27;s very liberal, nor is he wealthy, and he&#x27;s also fictional... but think of Frank Underwood). Sure, they vote Democratic, but they&#x27;re nasty, elitist people who will hurt your career for any reason or no reason at all, and who put a lot more stock into meaningless social prestige (connections, pedigree) than typical conservatives. Their liberalism is mostly an air they put on in order to make themselves socially acceptable since they can&#x27;t hide their wealth. (That&#x27;s not to say that all wealthy liberals are like that. The type certainly exists, though.) Frankly, it&#x27;s at the point that I don&#x27;t really care about a person&#x27;s macropolitics. Some of my favorite people are conservative (I think they&#x27;re wrong, but that&#x27;s another issue) and some of the worst people are nominally progressive (and probably sincere in their support for left-of-center politics). As with religious belief, some expect a correlation between position and ethical character, but the actual correlation seems to be near zero.<p>Frankly, I think that this <i>was</i> intentional. It has nothing to do with being &quot;a conservative&quot; or &quot;a liberal&quot;. This NIMBYism is about maintaining high house prices; it is <i>about</i> being a selfish piece of shit. It just gets a leftist veneer because these people are good at coming up with an argument that other people will listen to. End of story.<p><i>I think the progressive anti-growth sentiment is earnest; it’s people honestly trying to protect their city from unwanted change.</i><p>That&#x27;s the opposite of &quot;progressive&quot;. They&#x27;re <i>leftist</i>, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as being progressive. Kim Jong-Un is a leftist. So was Stalin. So are many of the Euro-rednecks<p>The U.S. is different from Europe in that our mouth-breathers, kooks, racists, regressives, and assholes are more numerous on the right of the economic spectrum... to the point where tropes are made of it. In Europe (and in NYC and San Francisco) the authoritarian nutjobs and the xenophobes and the anti-progress crowd is more evenly split between the left and right.<p>Some component of the Bay Area housing evil is ill-thought-out liberal politics (see: legacy rent control systems that don&#x27;t allow rents to rise even with inflation) but much more of this stuff is exclusionary than people will admit to.",1437702799

9939668,comment,9935471,9935471,0,0,epidemian,,,"This is unrelated to JS classes, but is there a good reason for using getters/setters for some properties but not for other? I&#x27;ve always had trouble understanding why some people prefer this style. For instance, given the article&#x27;s Circle definition (any of them), accessing a circle&#x27;s radius is different than accessing its area:<p><pre><code>  let c = new Circle(10);\n  c.radius   // => 10; good\n  c.area     // Nope, that returns a function.\n  c.area()   // => 314.15... OK\n  c.radius() // Raises a TypeError, 10 is not a function\n</code></pre>\nPresumably, the author declared the area accessor as a function instead of a getter because it does some other computation beyond returning a stored value. But a different implementation of Circle could instead store the area and compute the radius from that[1]. In that case, would we then have to change the way of accessing the circle&#x27;s properties to `c.area` and `c.radius()`?<p>I think it&#x27;d be much better to define these properties so accessing them has a uniform syntax: either `c.area` and `c.radius`, or `c.area()` and `c.radius()`[2]. Isn&#x27;t in fact the purpose of adding getters and setters to the language to allow users to define how a property is accessed?<p>[1]: That <i>might</i> make sense if it turns out that asking for a circle&#x27;s area is much more common than asking for its radius, and it&#x27;s done so frequently that it impacts performance; or if we prefer to have circles with nice round numbers for areas in our application and don&#x27;t care too much about their radii.<p>[2]: Yeah, i know that there is a named principle for this. In fact i always thought that adding getters and setters was motivated by the Uniform Access Principle.",1437702413

The company&#x27;s core business was not in software and the fact that they could produce helpful code in house on demand was more of an added bonus. I also had experience with our domain so I was able to help out on non-coding issues when needed, as well as spot where a program could be helpful.<p>There were issues, though luckily I was able to work through with the management. The biggest is that as the sole dev in a non-dev shop you (assuming you show value after a couple projects) have a lot of people at the company giving you projects and this will likely outstrip your personal bandwidth. This can lead to feeling like you have n bosses where n is the population of the company minus one. The trick here is to get good at saying no as well as getting someone who is <i>actually</i> your boss and getting them to let you use them as a shield. The other problem is that you will probably run into estimate problems. Software estimates are frustratingly inaccurate when you&#x27;re dealing with other devs, it gets much harder to explain to non-devs why &quot;this little feature&quot; is actually not so simple. The only thing that can help you here are your communication skills and other people&#x27;s understanding/respect. Pad your estimates, if something <i>really</i> needs to get done wicked fast they&#x27;ll let you know, otherwise just nicely surprise them getting it done early.<p>The second time I did it was terrible. The company was trying to develop a product that monitored sensor data and said it was going to expand the technical team. They also told me I could manage the technical project aspects myself since there weren&#x27;t any other technical people.<p>Coworkers would pop in at least three times an hour to ask for help with Office or GoogleSomething or their phone, despite me reminding them that a) I&#x27;m not tech support, b) it&#x27;s impossible to program if you&#x27;re getting pulled away from your desk every 15-20 minutes. I was told that someone had met a programmer who could and so I should be able to.<p>My boss constantly was changing the requirements of the project as well as giving me &quot;smaller projects&quot; that weren&#x27;t a part of the actual product. He would then be upset that despite working on Project F for two weeks we had made no progress on Project A for a whole two weeks! At one point the CEO demanded that I used a certain technology I had no experience using he got upset when I told him I had to devote some time to learning it.<p>Like any job these issues will largely depend on your coworkers and your boss(es), so YMMV but in my experience these issues are encouraged by the 1 techie vs n non-techies environment. Try to head off any of these issues early because if you let them get bad they will get intolerable.",1437701683

The city serves two populations: people who currently live in a city, and people who would like to immigrate to the city.<p>As a resident of a growing city, I find it somewhat puzzling and inconvenient that it&#x27;s taken as an article of faith that large city growth is a good thing. Growth is good, but it&#x27;s also bad: it brings congestion, filth, and higher housing prices. Even with the development of affordable housing, housing prices still rise. Furthermore, the traffic associated with high-density houses places a strain on the transit system and other public infrastructure and services that the city is usually unequipped to handle. Transit is often upgraded far too late, long after congestion has negatively impacted the lives of residents. It&#x27;s happening to me right now in my city: coworkers have reported their commute rising considerably over the past year.<p>So as the resident of a city who is happy with the way that it was, and is increasingly unhappy with the way it&#x27;s becoming, what I&#x27;m wondering is: why should I not vote to block and prevent this growth? A lot of city politics talks as if growth is naturally a good thing that should always be pursued, but talk far less often of quality of life for residents. Growth often comes at the expense of current residents. (Gradual growth is healthy and necessary, but excess growth harms everyone.)<p>If discouraging high-density housing means higher housing prices, but buys me less congestion and a higher quality of life, then that seems like a good tradeoff to me as a resident. Otherwise, I get higher housing prices <i>and</i> more congestion and a worse quality of life. Cities should serve their current residents first, and prospective future immigrants second.<p>I suspect that the strategy that San Francisco residents are pursuing is a strategy designed specifically to make it expensive to live there, to discourage further immigration that they do not want.",1437701633

9939552,comment,9939243,9939449,0,0,Lazare,,,"> Diversity does not survive in expensive areas<p>Arguably true.<p>> I understand the problems rent-control causes, but if it were removed and all residential areas jump up to market price then diversity would be completely destroyed.<p>As a matter of theory, it&#x27;s hard to see that rent control actually protects diversity.  And emperically, it&#x27;s absolutely not doing that, in San Francisco or in other cities which have tried it.<p>Here are you choices:<p>1. Remove restrictions on building.  Housing will be plentiful, diversity will be expanded, but what currently makes the city special will be lost (and maybe it&#x27;ll end up even better, but it&#x27;ll certainly change).\n2. Maintain restrictions on building.  Housing will be scarce, diversity will be lost, but the city won&#x27;t change.<p>Rent control is entirely orthogonal to this.  <i>IF</i> you have scarce housing, <i>then</i> you must allocate it among the people who want it.  One way to do this is via the market.  If you do not like the way the market will allocate it, then you can cap the rents and allocate it in some other fashion.  But as a society, we are extremely bad at allocating things fairly (hence why we rely on markets so much; it&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re very good, it&#x27;s that we&#x27;re really crap).<p>Which means that the way housing under rent control will inevitably be allocated <i>isn&#x27;t going to preserve diversity.</i> Rent control makes the lucky few who get to live in the city even luckier, but it doesn&#x27;t tell you who ends up being one of those lucky few.  But we know, from decades of experience, that the lucky few end tend to up being the already privileged.<p>Notice that San Francisco—with strong rent control laws—is actually not a diverse city.  Oakland—with weak ones—is one of the most diverse cities in the US.  Similar patterns can be seen across the US.  Your assumption that rent control aids diversity is supported neither by theory nor evidence; the fact that rent control <i>could</i> enable the poor to afford to live in a city doesn&#x27;t mean that it <i>will</i>.  And it doesn&#x27;t.<p>What really helps diversity is having a <i>lot</i> of housing relative to the number of people who want to live there.  San Francisco has scarce housing.",1437700689

To start with, they sneaked in the request to access all your email contacts and constantly spam them in your name which can be embarrassing at times to say the least.<p>2. Their mobile apps do the same with your phone contacts, cleverly hiding the checkmark (in smallest font) to disallow the uploading of contacts. I have unknowingly let them look through my contacts at least two different times prompting me to never install their app again.<p>3. Letting others know that you viewed their profile. This is fine as long as you know about this feature but I bet that a bunch of us were taken by surprise in the early days to find out that our &quot;online research&quot; on someone was not private unless if you&#x27;re incognito.<p>4. Charging you beyond the free trial period without any email or notification about it. I agree that many businesses do this but some of them like Amazon and Netflix are nice enough to allow you to disable the future payments before the trail ends. Also they tend to notify you about the payments.<p>5. Letting people have access to my email and other contact info even when I haven&#x27;t accepted their request to connect. This may have been fixed with the recent change but may just have been one of those hidden features that led to their popularity with the recruiter world in the first place.<p>I am sure I missed out a bunch of other things here but these are the reasons why I can never trust LinkedIn.",1437700331

A good store does $200 a day after COGS?<p>Say 8 hours/day and you&#x27;re looking at $25/hour, which I guess is pretty far above minimum wage, but is someone for whom $25/hour is an upgrade in a place to spend the $3k to buy in?<p>And if you&#x27;re operating in a slower area you&#x27;re not that far from making minimum wage.  If I wanted to operate a fleet of them I don&#x27;t see how I come out ahead after salary, overhead (increased loss from the minimum wage employee) and taxes.  Even at $175/day your looking at $21/hour income after COGS, pay someone $12/hour plus taxes and overhead and you&#x27;re profiting maybe $3/hour/bike.<p>I guess once you get to 30 or so you&#x27;re starting to make real money.

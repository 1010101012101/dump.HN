3472981,comment,3470900,3471489,1,0,sherwin,,,"I would argue just the opposite actually. Eclipse has a very intimidating interface intended for experienced developers -- I remember when I was learning Java I used Eclipse and it was not user friendly at all.<p>Also, my first intro CS course also used Karel the Robot, and while it was cool that I could see this guy run around on the screen, I kept wondering ""what is the point of this""? It didn't seem useful or related to writing actual programs at all. While it is less abstract than typing commands in a a prompt, it still felt very contrived.<p>But I guess that depends entirely on the student's motivation for learning to code -- are they looking to build a website? To understand how computers work? Because they like solving puzzles? Just to ""try it out""? Teaching through a robot game like Karel probably would not be a good approach for those who want to get their hands dirty and build actual stuff (and Java is probably not the best first language). But for those who are more interested in understanding computer science / puzzles, those who value the problem solving aspect of programming, a tangible game like Karel might be better.<p>However, I'd still say CodeAcademy's approach with browser based lessons is much better -- there's a much lower barrier to getting started than downloading and setting up an IDE. Furthermore, they have complete control of their site design. I don't think introducing REPL at the beginning is the best idea, but it's better than hitting the student with a sledgehammer like Eclipse.<p>Perhaps a compromise would be a very simple game in Ruby/Python? There was a web based Ruby game on HN recently, intended for experienced programmers, in which you wrote the AI for a bot navigating through a map. Obviously that is too complicated for a beginner, but I imagine something simpler could be both appealing, engaging, and accessible.",1326754306

Intel (and SGI) worked to create a compiler that could maximize the use of the VLIW instruction set of the processor to achieve application specific performance.<p>This was presented by Intel to its enterprise customers as the 'secret sauce' that would give Itanium the edge over SPARC and other 64 bit architectures. They have invested millions in making this effort work.<p>However, reception of a workflow for the Itanium compiler was mixed at best. Some workloads it out performed, others it simply matched. The process for training the compiler, which seemed to me at the time to be an outgrowth of the branch prediction efforts, involved running synthetic benchmarks, collecting information about utilization of the execution units and then synthesizing new instruction mixes for the applications. The imposition of such a heavy weight process which needed to be repeated for nearly every change to the code base, worked against the benefits promised. Since code is likely to change often, proposals of waiting until you are 'ready to ship' before optimziation and tuning. But once shipped patches are made, bugs fixed, anomalies corrected. Changing any line of code could create a massive stall in the pipeline and crush performance until the system was re-tuned.<p>I don't know if that experience was universal, but it was common enough that such stories were everywhere at places like the Microprocessor Forum and other conferences.",1326753210

They also want extra services like backups, firewalls, ddos protection,control panel software, extra ip's and so on. Most people want support beyond the minimum which would be
hardware replacement and network connectivity only. In an ideal world hosting companies would sell a server and then the customer would take complete control of the server and hate the idea 
of the host logging on to their box. In reality most dedicated server customers are people who have busy sites that have outgrown traditional shared hosting but are not sever administrators.
They want a host they can call up to do small jobs for them and pay for more involved work. Were the lines are drawn on this extra support varies dramatically between providers but
will make most real world difference to the majority of customers.",1326751987

Ants as you may know live in colonies, and generally produce huge underground nests. They are often able to find the shortest path to food and building supplies, the nests are kept free of obstacles and defended to the death. Yet, there is no central controller (the ""queen"" is a misnomer, all she does is give birth) that indicates where the tunnels go, noone is telling an ant what to do at any other time. The system evolves naturally out of very simple genetic rules and is based on communication between peer ants.

I took the MITx Electronics and Circuits class, and so far it seems that I haven't found an employer who cares one bit.  I hadn't put it on the resume/CV, but I have mentioned it in cover letters and such for employers that it seemed relevant.<p>I wouldn't let this point of pessimism stop you (it's not stopping me, I'm taking Machine Learning now).  As others have indicated, this will probably let you pass job interviews others can't.  But in my experience with regard to the job application process, it will likely be something they ignore, and I would try to get them to talk to you about it in another fashion (bring it up in the interview, cover letters, etc).<p>Note that this is from an US perspective, I know the ideals behind a CV and a resume are quite different so you may want local advice.  However, if I were making a CV for an academic position in the US, I'd probably still leave it off.",1368809957

5725455,comment,5724731,5725321,3,0,cookiecaper,,,"The problem with MS is that their whole business has been about propping up either Windows or Office. Both are in jeopardy now and Microsoft is panicking, trying to save these products without the reference frame of what they really are, other than the two businesses that every other Microsoft enterprise is designed to uphold. Even the Xbox exists simply as a way to underscore the foothold of DirectX and keep Windows PCs the primary platform for 3D simulation.<p>Look at Windows 8. MS saw the tablet market explode and started to panic, aware that this may replace a lot of Windows PCs that would otherwise be sold to casual users. So they decided to integrate tablet stuff into Windows, so that Windows gets on devices that have this desirable form factor for casual users, and then they get the added bonus that the programs that work on their PCs will work just fine on their tablets and vice-versa.<p>This is actually a somewhat compelling proposition, the issue is that the implementation was horrific. Microsoft, in their attempt to continue universal dominance, failed to realize that people still on normal form factors, including the business market, would not take kindly to a full-screen, huge tile start menu, which is impossible to actually replace with something real, only a bunch of rough hacks to try and get back to a normal-type start menu. That's an interface for a casual device, not a serious business device, but MS has pushed it onto everything.<p>Microsoft needs to come to terms, and it can continue and adapt to market conditions. They may have to give up a little bit of ground in the short-term, but they at least won't stamp themselves out of existence. OS X is a consumer-centric OS. Android and iOS are consumer-centric OSes designed for entertainment and/or casual use devices. Windows is still the undisputed king in user-facing business systems. They should really <i>not</i> be revolting their business users by forcing them to learn certain mouse gestures in certain menus to find a <i>shutdown</i> option, or blanking out their screens with humongous, disruptive context switches every time someone wants to open a program. This is much, much worse than the iOSification of OS X that some have bemoaned, for instance; while there is an iOS-like menu, it hasn't replace Spotlight or Finder, and you can use your Mac without that intrusion if you choose. Even Apple recognizes that the interfaces are not directly and universally applicable to the different devices.<p>If MS recognizes that they need to focus on enterprise and <i>conservatively</i> integrate <i>reasonable</i> niceties from consumer-facing systems, they have a future. If not, they'll continue to flail about trying to be all things to all people, unwilling to accept that the tech landscape has changed and Windows may not be the universal thing anymore, and kill themselves.<p>Without such aggressive Metro integration, no one would have had any gripes with Windows 8. MS should quickly repent and issue Windows 9 with Metro as an optional extension and a classic explorer.exe shell as the default, because that's what business users need and expect.",1368809688

What seems better may actually provide misleading cues.<p>For example, consider the alignment in the following, improved snippet from the blog post:<p><pre><code>    var x        = shape.left(),\n        y        = shape.right(),\n        numSides = shape.sides();\n</code></pre>\nIt may be better typographically, but it also suggests a false parallelism.<p>The eye can't help but interpret closely packed things as groups.  So the subliminal cue presented by the formatting above is that there is a parallel assignment from the group of expressions on the right to the group of variables on the left.  That is, at some level the eye can't help but see the code above as<p><pre><code>                   { e }\n         { v }     { x }\n    var  { a }  =  { p } ;\n         { r }     { r }\n         { s }     { s }\n</code></pre>\nBut the evaluation and assignment are not parallel!  They are sequential.  The difference may not matter in this example, but it's easy to imagine this kind of formatting applied to examples where it would.<p>The less-formatted original version below actually represents the reality more faithfully because its shape does not suggest parallelism:<p><pre><code>    var x = shape.left(),\n        y = shape.right(),\n        numSides = shape.sides();\n</code></pre>\nIt looks more like a sequence, which it is.<p>Indeed, typography is a subtle and tricky thing.",1368807180

Those users can follow other users, items and compares and if there are new interactions with those items or by the users they follow it will show up in their stream. They gain experience points with every action they take for certain items, they get badges and rankings for certain keywords, so for example the person doing the most ratings, reviews etc. for video games will be the #1 on the video games list. Users can select that they have certain items which then go into their achievements list or want and they go into your wish list.

I think the best we can do is to minimize it, and create structures that at least respect the sovereignty of the individual.<p>But even what I just said gets to the point of why ""we"" will never be uniformly happy.  Different people have fundamentally different goals and principles and there's objective way to resolve those disputes.

Other people have more of a utilitarian ""the most happiness for the maximum number of people"" as their principle.  And unless the former inevitably leads to the latter by coincidence, there's really no way to reconcile those two positions, in terms of ""how do we solve social problems"" since those two people don't even agree on what the problem is in the first place.<p>As for democracy: ""Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.

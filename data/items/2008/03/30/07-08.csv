149986,comment,149887,149960,0,0,prakash,,,"IMHO, the biggest concern is HN going the reddit way. So here's a stab at trying to fix that:<p>- If we can get the list of the top 10-50 hostnames (xkcd, etc) posted on reddit, and deny publication of those hostnames on HN, the signal to noise ratio should go up (how much I don't know?)<p>- Obviously, some good posts would be missed, but it's alright to have a few false positives, since this is a website of aggregated news and not email<p>What do the folks here think?",1206863630

149975,comment,149887,149951,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"If I understand your idea correctly, a side-effect would be that it would be harder to go back and comment on articles you have already read.  So if everyone did this, the amount of discussion for each post would decrease.<p>I'd be happy with a less drastic measure:  Why store the previously read info in a cookie?  Perhaps it could be stored with my account instead.  This way the highlighting of previously-read articles would be consistent regardless of which PC I happened to be using.<p>The number of articles stored could be limited to a reasonable number (say 3x length of the # of items on the front page).",1206862810

It's not necessarily the quality of the content, but the fact that too many posts stay on the front page for too long. Something about reading the same piece of ""news"" for 2 or more days really irritates me. If I was at least on the same computer it wouldn't be too bad, as visited links would get marked. But I read this site on my desktop, laptop, phone and work computer.<p>I've mentioned this earlier and requested the ability to dismiss items for view (archive), but pg didn't seem to think it was a good idea and/or worthwhile to implement. Every time time I see the same story on the front page 2 days in a row I get this sudden urge to add<p>127.0.0.1 news.ycombinator.com<p>to /etc/hosts.

Being willing to set themselves a tight schedule when necessary and being able to meet it might not be such a bad thing for a startup investor. :-)",1179171410

Also it's unlikely that <i>anyone</i> who got accepted would give a negative review of it because it's valuable even if it doesn't ""work out"".<p>With sites like <a href=""http://overhear.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://overhear.us</a> the phrase ""they can't all be winners"" springs to mind; however, I have a hard time believing they were more promising than the hundreds who got turned down.

21989,comment,21469,21535,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"Lists such as these have a Rorschach test quality to them.  They are often little more than pithy assertions that tend to resonate with some people.  But the meaning and value is what the reader infers based on personal biases, not so much what is in the actual message<p>As you've noticed, though,  aphorisms tend to come in pairs.  E.g., Many hands make light work; too many chef's spoil the broth.  Which one is ""true"" will  depend on whether you're surrounded by busy-bodies, or unloading a moving van by yourself.<p>I tend to favor this one: ""Skill to do comes from doing.""",1179170212

21985,comment,21923,21977,0,0,jamesbritt,,," I think if the value you gain from doing something outweighs the opportunity cost paid for not working on your startup, you ought to go ahead and do that thing. <p>Quite true.   Ive been going through the videos, an SICP (albeit slowly). Yes, I sometimes feel that I could be writing production code instead of getting an education.  I believe, though, that having some additional insights on software development will pay off quite well in the future.<p>Plus it's fun. :)",1179169462

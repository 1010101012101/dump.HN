Completely abstracting away HTML is a mistake but some level of abstraction like a template engine is highly useful.  I can hardly work without some ""control"" abstraction for form elements to handle setting the attributes and ensuring the form values persist between requests.  Template engines can vastly improve the security of your code by making value substitutions safe by default.<p>The problem with most frameworks, in my opinion, isn't the abstraction part at all.  It's that they're over-engineered.  It seems like many frameworks approach Turing completeness as they attempt to solve more and more problems and you end up writing framework programs from within your program.  Sometimes you even get to use XML for this purpose.",1311216269

(More intelligent things are possible there.)<p>- Explore the player moves in a clever order to avoid getting bogged down in useless branches. You could use an existing tetris AI to pick sensible moves for you and examine them first, or use simple heuristics.<p>- In the same spirit, since you seem to be using an exact but complicated (and costly) way to compute possible player moves, it might make sense to first explore a subset of moves which is easier to compute. For instance, examine first the moves which are just an horizontal movement, a rotation, and a straight drop. Maybe there is a winning strategy for the player which mostly uses such moves.<p>- I am not sure of what you cache. There is no point in caching the whole well, just caching the lines with a reachable empty space. Also, hitting any configuration from the cache is deadly (since it means we went higher and went back to an equivalent configuration).<p>Hopefully this is sensible and isn't stuff you already do.

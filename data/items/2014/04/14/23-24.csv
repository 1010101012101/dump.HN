Not preventing suicide would mean we give up solving the actual problem of inflicted emotional pain. At the same time, IMHO, the focus is on suicide prevention rather than catering the emotional needs of individuals because there&#x27;s a tendency for society in aggregate to only solve problems at the last minute. i.e. Society doesn&#x27;t care about your health until you reach the emergency room.

Yes, tinc does not abstract any of these things from you. But if you know what you are doing (not saying I always know what I am doing) it can be a powerful tool to build the exact network you want without any provider lock-in.<p>Now, I must agree on that, it might not be a friendly solution for dead easy routing to an exit node as a proxy with dns-tunneling built in. I just wanted to know why tinc does not get enough love, and you answered accordingly. But if you are building a serious network I do think tinc hits the sweet spot between being easy and allowing for any network you can think of without being tied to a particular server provider that might offer private IPs.<p>As for the configuration I use git, which makes it super easy to setup the N+1th server. None of the private keys are committed to the repo, of course. My infrastructure is not that big so I am still doing some things by hand, but it should be easy to automate some parts by using git hooks + puppet|ansible|chef.<p>About the protocol I do not understand why it would be a problem, other than not being ssh or the possibility of being filtered over the network.

This reduces your velocity and causes the orbit of your ship to eventually enter the atmosphere.<p>Atmospheric drag is then going to provide most of your deceleration, slowing you down to terminal velocity. You then make another burn at the very end of the flight to slow down from terminal velocity and stop.<p>The second stage is a good example. After making a deceleration burn, it will be re-orienting so that the heat shield at the top is facing the direction of movement. It will then keep this orientation until it is safe to orient the vehicle around for landing.<p>You <i>could</i> use your engines for most of the deceleration... but it would consume a very large amount of fuel.

7589586,comment,7588520,7589446,2,0,mbillie1,,,"Well, in answer to 1., often suicide is attempted at times of extreme emotional volatility - in other words, when it&#x27;s easy to make a mistake. Additionally, suicide is almost always linked to depression, which manifests itself in a whole host of ways. It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;just point a gun at your head and shoot, what&#x27;s so hard about that?&quot; Well it&#x27;s terrifying, which is emotional. It costs money to acquire a gun, and money problems are highly associated with depression. It&#x27;s a social activity, and social anxiety often is related to suicidal behavior, etc.<p>If it were a decision like &quot;which toothpaste works better&quot;, and you could calmly evaluate evidence and act impartially, I imagine there would be fewer suicide attempts, fewer suicides, and a higher percentage of attempts would succeed. But this is a vastly different sort of thing, an intrinsically uninstinctual act. This is just speculation, but I would guess that the rare cases where the suicidal person is overwhelmingly justified by his or her decision (Goering killing himself painlessly rather than being tried and hanged), the success rate improves.<p>In response to 2., I have no idea - that is an empirical question. But it&#x27;s an interesting question, and it&#x27;s good to see the topic discussed in the media as it generally is quite taboo.",1397519606

Lets say your country were to setup a network interconnecting major research institutions, etc. After its use takes off and it is obvious that everyone is going to be communicating over this new medium in a short amount of time, you see the value in keeping tabs on people. You decide that it is in your best interest to put backdoors into encryption algorithms in enterprise communication software. So you see there are these guys that have become the place that everyone is starting to go to find what they are looking for. This is a good place to be. You eventually get your hands on this also. It&#x27;s a waste of time and energy to constantly be decrypting everyone&#x27;s messages, so what the hell- let&#x27;s put a backdoor in that also. Everything is going well.

But, once again:<p>Your &quot;Cloudflare Challenge&quot; (that&#x27;s what you called it) was not a particularly useful way to answer the question posed by Heartbleed. What you want to know is, &quot;is there private key material in heap memory?&quot;, or, to make things even simpler, &quot;are our assumptions about how key material hits heap memory accurate?&quot;. The correct way to answer this question is to instrument and analyze an OpenSSL/nginx runtime, not to create and market a treasure hunt for an undisclosed private key on a single site.<p>You employ smart people. You could have done better than this challenge. Instead, what seems to have happened is that your company got inserted into the middle of a story it had little to do with (correct me if I&#x27;m mistaken and unaware of something your team did to research Heartbleed), and, with that spotlight shining, actively marketed a harmful false conclusion about the bug while also bidding for the spare cycles of other people who might have been more effective doing something other than poking at your server.

Earlier today, something interesting happened. I attended a session in which four different professors from four different universities presented their latest research. Surprisingly, all four presentations tackled the same narrow problem—information dissemination in networks—using the same narrow technique—randomized linear network coding. It was as if my research community woke up one morning and collectively and spontaneously decided to tackle the same esoteric problem.<p>This example of joint discovery surprised me, but it would not have surprised the science writer Steven Johnson. In his engaging 2010 book, Where Good Ideas Come From, Johnson explains that such “multiples” are frequent in the history of science. Consider the discovery of sunspots in 1611: As Johnson notes, four scientists, from four different countries, all identified the phenomenon during that same year. The first electrical battery? Invented twice in the mid-eighteenth century. Oxygen? Isolated independently in 1772 and 1774. In one study cited by Johnson, researchers from Columbia University found just shy of 150 different examples of prominent scientific breakthroughs made by multiple researchers at near the same time.”<p>Excerpt From: Newport, Cal. “So Good They Can&#x27;t Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love.”<p>His thesis on this is basically that these discoveries depend on a lot of other things occurring first and that once those things have occurred, anyone looking in the right place will see it.<p>With all of that said, I remain skeptical, at least in the Heartbleed case (they&#x27;re just SOO close together). tptacek has more experience in these things than me of course, so I&#x27;ll defer to his thoughts.",1397519108

Nobody should sneer at the power of diligent saving and compound interest (or, for that matter, at college tuition to grow faster than either inflation or your 529 plan :).<p>That said, the original sentence that kicked off this subthread was talking about a 10 year time frame:<p>&quot;A 30-year old engineer making $120,000 a year should become a millionaire easily by the time they are 40&quot;<p>And by the time we got to where I commented, someone seemed to be believe that $88k vs $80k post-tax might make the difference in whether or not it&#x27;s true that one could be a millionaire &quot;easily&quot; in a 10 year time frame.<p>The answer, as far as I can tell, is no... uless you can live on $16k and invest the rest. It seems to me it takes roughly $72k invested annually at 6% to make you a million in 10 years.<p>(I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s possible to live on $16k per year. I&#x27;ve done so in the last five years. But not while working full-time in metro California.)<p>> First, it was a 20% difference<p>So, a person with $4,000 left over at the end of the year instead of $3,200 should be just as excited as someone with $40,000 instead of $32,000, I suppose. :)",1397519001

7589543,comment,7589286,7589441,3,0,eastdakota,,,"Here was our initial conclusion from the CloudFlare post you referenced:<p>============<p>We think the stealing private keys on most NGINX servers is at least extremely hard and, likely, impossible. Even with Apache, which we think may be slightly more vulnerable, and we do not use at CloudFlare, we believe the likelihood of private SSL keys being revealed with the Heartbleed vulnerability is very low. That’s about the only good news of the last week.<p>We want others to test our results so we created the Heartbleed Challenge. Aristotle struggled with the problem of disproving the existence of something that doesn’t exist. You can’t prove the negative, so through experimental results we will never be absolutely sure there’s not a condition we haven’t tested. However, the more eyes we get on the problem, the more confident we will be that, in spite of a number of other ways the Heartbleed vulnerability was extremely bad, we may have gotten lucky and been spared the worst of the potential consequences.<p>That said, we’re proceeding assuming the worst. With respect to private keys held by CloudFlare, we patched the vulnerability before the public had knowledge of the vulnerability, making it unlikely that attackers were able to obtain private keys. Still, to be safe, as outlined at the beginning of this post, we are executing on a plan to reissue and revoke potentially affected certificates, including the cloudflare.com certificate.<p>Vulnerabilities like this one are challenging because people have imperfect information about the risks they pose. It is important that the community works together to identify the real risks and work towards a safer Internet. We’ll monitor the results on the Heartbleed Challenge and immediately publicize results that challenge any of the above.<p>============<p>Which is exactly what we did. To be clear, we were wrong. Our mistaken assumption was focusing on the private key itself and not focusing enough on the exponents that are used to generate the key -- which is what the researchers who solved the challenge were able to obtain. As the wishy-washy conclusion above hopefully makes clear, even when we said it was hard to get the private keys, we were very uncertain and uncomfortable with that conclusion. That&#x27;s why we posted the challenge. What the challenge did was answer the question definitively: you can get private SSL keys. Knowing that has been valuable for us in deciding to accelerate reissue/revocation process for all the certs we manage on behalf of our customers. Remember: at our scale, revoking hundreds of thousands of certs risked breaking our CA partners&#x27; infrastructure, so it wasn&#x27;t without a cost. Knowing the risk is higher than we originally thought accelerated our efforts which will be complete in the next 48 hours. And, beyond CloudFlare, our hope is knowing the risk is real and proven has benefited other organizations as well.",1397518884

The distance between Toronto and Montreal is about 6 hours of driving, which in turn is two times the cold-weather range of the Model S. Given that you generally want to refuel before you hit rock-bottom empty, and that battery performance will degrade over time, that means two recharging stops in the Tesla, where you&#x27;ll have to wait for half an hour while the car charges.

Add another $8,000 for a single car (payment, insurance, gas, and maintenance), $6,000 for student loan debt (easily achievable for a $60,000--2x the average, one for each earner--load) and that leaves $6,000 for food, childcare, and utilities (and anything else I&#x27;m forgetting) before that $40k is gone.

291737,comment,291550,291550,0,0,mercurio,,,"Wait... don't the two solutions have the same time complexity?<p>The bitwise XOR approach should depend on the maximum size of the numbers (say k) along with the length of the array (say n) as O(nk), and just using radix sort on the array will take time O(nk) too.<p>If you assume that bitwise XOR is constant time, that implies that the numbers in the array are bounded by a constant, and therefore Radix sort can sort the array in O(c.n) = O(n). In either case, they have the same running time.",1220247916

291728,comment,291132,291604,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"""There are too many clueless people who pick up Python and love it and swear by the gods that there is no language like it, even though their experience with languages is summed up with C++, Java, and now Python. ""<p>To be fair, the same seems true of Ruby (mostly via Rails); they come from Java or PHP and declare Ruby the pinnacle of language design.<p>(I'd like to think, though, they are a mostly a noisy minority.  There are a lot of Ruby, non-Rails Ruby, developers who just quietly go about their business.)",1220246535

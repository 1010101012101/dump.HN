Certainly everyone has the <i>capacity</i> for some level of creativity, but I think the type that we're talking about here is the same sort of gift that artists have.<p>Similarly to how some people are simply born with a genetic predisposition towards athletics, some people are born with the same sort of genetic predisposition towards mathematics.<p>The idea that everyone has got the same abilities is exactly the problem that we're talking about here.  Some people ARE born with an advantage (or have one nurtured into them), and those people need to be allowed to excel, not held back because of those around them.",1243295892

626038,comment,625933,626009,0,0,mighty,,,"I think there's a lot Apple needs to do to improve the IA of the App Store, and they need to make the iTunes store accessible from standard web browsers rather than just the iTunes software. But there's nothing preventing iPhone app developers from creating websites for their apps, and there are a variety of sites that review apps. That you cannot <i>buy</i> an iPhone app outside of the App Store does nothing to prevent developers from gaining visibility outside of it. There is nothing preventing anyone from Googling for iPhone apps (just as you can Google for non-iPhone apps), than the developers themselves.<p>As for the differences in sales curves, that's actually reflective of how much easier it is to find and purchase new apps on the App Store (as well as the increased competition -> price reduction that their aggregation provides), as opposed to having hundreds or thousands of different purchase sites with their own method for payment processing. Also note that most iPhone apps tend to be for entertainment, for which an early sales spike and sudden drop-off is the norm regardless of platform...or medium.",1243295446

However, when I flip flop to other platforms, the native experience isn't so great - so outside of the mac, I can see the general desire to just make the web the UI for any and all productivity apps at least (and who knows, perhaps even richer apps and 3d stuff in the future).<p>Its funny, on a mac, if you time things with a watch its not ""fast"" - loading times, and so on, but the experience is smooth enough that I find the native apps quite nice to quickly open, jot down a note and move on (eg evernote).",1243294434

But all we see around us makes it pretty obvious this is not the case. Whatever means we have of improving ourselves, they're woefully underused. We actually have ways to make intellectual work better. Not science fiction, but simply a trip to the pharmacy. They work (there have been several articles on HN about provigil or ritalin), and they can be made safe - they mostly are, all we need are some proper guidelines. But what do we do? We talk about outlawing them. And they are definitely not publicly acknowledged.<p>And before you say that this is not the same: how exactly is it not? Can you imagine a way to improve a human being which would be socially acceptable? Not curing handicaps, but making better for the sake of making better. Just imagine the public reaction if a company offered implantable headphones. Cutting a human for no medical purpose is social suicide.<p>Now of course this can not stop progress forever.

626015,comment,625523,625523,0,0,rntz,,,"Coming from Haskell, this seems a lot like taking the entire state of the world, sans I/O, and just bundling it into a monad (or MonadPlus, etc). Powerful, but a bit of a blunt instrument compared to using a finer-grained technique. The backtracking use-case given of trying two keys to open a safe, for example, is straightfoward to solve with the List monad.<p><pre><code>    import OutsideWorld (keyA, keyB, unlocksSafe)
    
    unlockSafe = do
        key <- [keyA, keyB]

626012,comment,625917,625917,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Perhaps you and I should talk.  We're working on something in this direction at the moment, based in part on our existing systems and cloud management tools.<p>But, because we don't see an immediate way for it to pay for itself (and the investors we've floated the idea vaguely before aren't too interested at this particular moment in history), we're being a bit cautious about actually deploying...but there is a long history of corporations, governments and schools donating mirrors for Open Source file service...no good reason why they shouldn't do the same for cloud-based Open Source services.<p>The existing tools generally are somewhat less oriented towards sandboxing than they would need to be for this to be feasible today, but it's definitely not an unimaginable future.  Trust in widely distributed filesystems is also a problem that isn't entirely covered by existing tools; though the techniques for insuring trust are obviously well-known and understood by a small set of developers.<p>But, if you assume a distributed VCS as the starting point (git is, I suppose already capable of verifying itself and its contributors), a distributed trustworthy key/value (Tokyo Cabinet or similar with contributor signatures built in) as the configuration source, and distributed trustworthy map reduce and relational databases as the data store, it'd begin to look like something usable.<p>It introduces problems that current web services and even cloud hosting services don't have to solve, though, which is potentially untrusted machines being part of the cloud and holding the data.  Going fully distributed means you don't have any single source for trust information.  And, key signing parties are so 1991.  I'm not sure exactly how to solve that one.  It's not impossible, it's just one of those problems that I don't see an immediate solution for.  Short-term, perhaps a single trusted source for keys would be an acceptable solution until a network of key-signing entities could spring up.  Alternatively, traditional SSL certs could be used with the usual crappy process of issuing them.",1243292635

Instead, taxes would be funneled through local or state governments, which would be responsible for contributing some amount of that to the federal government.  Local governments could then tweak who, what and how much they tax in order to attract business.  Policy might also become less homogeneous across cities and states because the federal government would have less money to hold over the heads of local policy makers.

7179059,story,,,1,1,centdev,"Show HN: Dealora – What we learned starting up",,"My experiences with how we just launched Dealora [1].<p>In June 2013, my wife and I decided to start a business together. We brought in 2 close friends of ours to help with sales and dev. The following month, launched a landing page [2] by sending out 2000 postcards to local businesses. We did see a small bump in traffic for the first few days but email sign ups for the pre-launch was disappointing. Cold-calling and Adwords - major disappointment. We met with a few local businesses in person but with little to show, we couldn&#x27;t even get a handful to sign up for the launch.<p>The data showed little interest. We shouldn&#x27;t move forward. Somewhat defeated, we pushed forward anyway. The opposite of what a start up should do.<p>Months later, we launch. No more cold-calling or reaching out by email. We&#x27;re meeting face-to-face, sitting down with the business owners, being hands-on with on-boarding -- They appreciate the attentiveness. We&#x27;re now getting sign ups daily but operating at a loss. Not a failure or success, but a slow start. The next few months will be the hardest in a crowded market.<p>My big takeaways learned:<p>- Not being able to validate your idea doesn&#x27;t may not mean the idea isn&#x27;t good, it could be you aren&#x27;t conveying it in a meaningful way. We didn&#x27;t.<p>- Know the language you need to use when pitching. We used technical terms to pitch something to potential customers who are normally not very technical.<p>- Cold-calling restaurants is bad idea.<p>- Building the product is not the hard part, its selling it.<p>- You can sell your product by listening first. Business owners love to talk about their business. If you listen closely, you can find ways for your product to solve their needs.<p>Would be really helpful to get feedback from the HN community on things we can improve and experiences others have had selling to SMB.<p>[1] https://dealora.com/<p>[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6012998",1391536426

It seems natural to us for someone promoted to the heights of their profession, such as Satya Nadella in this case, or the winner of a Nobel prize or an academy award, for example, to describe the accomplishment as &quot;humbling&quot;, when logically speaking it should be anything but.<p>Is such a statement part of a defense mechanism against egotism that prevents the honored individual from loosing the discipline that allowed them to excel in the first place?  Is it an attempt to say, &quot;this doesn&#x27;t change me, I am still who I was before&quot;?  Is it just a manipulation, a defense against envy and derision, an attempt to reduce the motivation of others to &quot;take them down a notch&quot;?  Or is it something else?<p>Without thinking about it too deeply, it seems right to read that Satya Nadella is humbled to become one of the most powerful corporate executives in the world, but why?

If they are moral, it is only because morality maximizes profit. On the other hand, if breaking the law maximizes profit (e.g. because enforcement is lax or penalties are low) then that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll do. Likewise, if immoral acts make the most money, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll do.<p>This has been demonstrated to not be true. Decision makers at corporations are not rational actors, they may choose to pursuit business plans and take courses of action that actually harm profit. We have seen in the banking and housing collapse that there are those that knowingly seek their own personal profit at the expense of others, including the very businesses they work for.<p>> What Hollywood gets wrong is that corporations aren&#x27;t intentionally evil. There&#x27;s no CEO sitting in his office laughing maniacally about how his new project is going to kill widows and orphans. Hollywood always wants a villain, but in this case there isn&#x27;t one. Villainy falls out of the corporate structure and lots of employees just doing their jobs to keep bread on the table.<p>This is has also been demonstrated to be false.

Discretizing wavelengths for simplicity of explanation, the stimulus is a vector where each element specifies the amplitude at each wavelength.<p>The color bar of rainbow colors is a sub-sampling of this spectrum where only one element is taken at a time.  In other words, those are monochromatic colors.  Alternatively, each point in the rainbow is obtained by multiplying a delta function with the stimulus and integrating over the wavelengths.  This sub-sampling cannot possibly cover the entire color space.  In fact, the majority are missing, including magenta which is not a monochromatic color.<p>The human eyes also sub-samples this space.  However, it does not use delta functions.  Each cone has its own vector (or more precisely a function of wavelength) and the sensed amplitude is integral of this vector multiplied by the stimulus.  This is very much a dimensionality reduction problem where given the spectrums of natural objects around us, nature chose a smaller space that allows distinguishing the objects as much as possible.<p>Quite obviously, the sub-sampling done by the human eye also leads to loss of information.  There would be spectrums which are different but would map to the same perceived color.  See metamerism: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_%28color%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_%28color%29</a><p>Electronic-displays use RGB because those three colors then cover a good percentage of the colors human eyes can perceive.  When more than three primary colors are used in the display technology to enhance color gamut, etc., avoiding metamerism issues becomes an interesting concern as we need to make sure colors which should appear the same do not appear different given that the cone response curves varies somewhat between humans, varies with age, and also surrounding illumination can impact the two rendered colors in different ways.<p>See also my older related comment on the topic:  <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5931005"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5931005</a>",1391533696

To me the post seemed to be well intended: a way to get the message through to the investors so that the problem could be resolved without legal unpleasantness. EDIT: That is still well within request for &quot;honest advice&quot; in my books, or at least I dont see whats dishonest about the advice sought.",1391533212

If D-Wave have managed it I must admit I&#x27;d be surprised, but the amount of venom thrown their way is curious.",1391533208

It adds fission, fusion and antimatter reactors with all their drawbacks(<i>), generators (even gives the carnot efficiency), and of course radiators, with the generator efficiency depending on how hot the reactor is vs how cold the radiators are.<p>(</i>) fission produces waste subproducts, have to be shutdown for maintenance and cool down, fusion requires an electrical generator to sustain the fusion (also fuel, have to centrifuge deuterium etc) and of course antimatter have to be collected and stored in magnetic containment devices which require power to maintain. etc.",1391533208

This discussion will be had in the hearing where the union takes the side of the defending party.<p>Basically it&#x27;s the same principle as fair trial: Everyone has a right to have a fair trial and bring an attorney that has the duty to defend him, no matter the charges or how clear the case seems.",1391533202

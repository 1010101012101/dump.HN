10508,comment,10249,10249,0,0,imperator,,,"My current business partner went to the same highschool as I. He and I became friends because of our love of ideas. We both looked to the future not just as an amusing fiction, but as something we would create. So we were always working on science projects, rail guns, etc.<p>My initial interest in applying to Ycomb came when a friend of my brother's put an alert out to anyone who wanted to start a business on top of an idea he had around OpenID. I expressed interest and after he discarded his idea, he opted to join my project. However, the connection between he and I was far looser, and eventually he left the group. Interestingly, a day before our third left I told my brother that I had a feeling our third was going to leave. Not particularly useful prescience, but I think it goes to show that if you have a bad feeling about a relationship, you should listen to it.

Many of the coolest nerds I've hung out with are borderline foodies, though constrained by time and money, and nearly all are on the healthy side of Ayers's split.<p>If the article isn't misleading, I wonder what's going on. Are the YC guys just too busy? But they have time to shop (they just shop badly) and cooking catalyses productive conversations. Did they never learn to cook? But they must have parents, and the internet has a million recipes. Is there an obvious reason why food-oblivious people would end up at YC?",1176063191

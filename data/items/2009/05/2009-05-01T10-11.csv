588338,comment,587610,588239,0,0,tom_b,,,"I think this is a huge part of the issue.  I have worked professionally on the big three commercial rdbms (DB2 distributed - not mainframe -, SQL Server, and Oracle).  I consider myself a SQL hacker with some DBA experience and knowledge, mainly around DB design and performance tuning.<p>I simply don't care what rdbms I coding to, I can tweak to leverage quirkiness in T-SQL or PL/SQL if needed or advantageous to a project.  And, <whispering>, PL/pgSQL.<p>A common experience for me when job searching is to apply for a job where, for example, they are primarily looking for Oracle PL/SQL development.  I've been doing SQL coding for roughly 8 years, the last 2 years or so have been primarily in Oracle PL/SQL.  I have been turned down for interviews with feedback that says ""oh, we need someone with 5 years of Oracle development work.""<p>If it's techies doing the resume reviews, I always get at least an interview.  Sometimes even then, I have to sell the fact that SQL skills transfer nicely between rdbms harder than I should.",1241174939

588333,comment,588193,588230,0,0,gaius,,,"I'd hesitate to describe Oracle as ""anti-hacker"". There's so much duplication and overlap and redundancy in their product range not because they don't know what they're doing but because they'll ship anything anyone comes up with and see what sticks with customers. You can download pretty much everything they do for free from their website and play with it. Sure their core RDBMS engine is closed-source (they've got to make money somehow) but most of the actual functionality is in PL/SQL and you can read it to your heart's content. Same business model is used by Wolfram.",1241174413
588332,comment,587271,587850,0,0,Tichy,,,"Except that 40 years is nothing. Things can change - look at the former Sowjet Union. Maybe a US president comes to power that withdraws funding from the Navy, and things will start to deteriorate (just making that up, but with really long time frames, all bets are off).<p>Edit: yahooing for ""us navy reactor accidents"" comes up with quite a few hits, and allegations that mostly the Navy is very secretive about it.<p>Edit2: Even with the best trained staff, the staff is essentially just running an algorithm. Training the staff makes sure they run the algorithm correctly, but it does not protect against bugs in the algorithm. If you are a software developer, you don't believe in bug free algorithms (above a certain complexity).",1241174362
588330,comment,587271,587536,0,0,Tichy,,,"That is a bit of a strawman argumentation, though. The parole is usually not ""use coal plants instead of nuclear plants"", it is essentially to get rid of nuclear plants. Instead of building more coal plants, saving energy is an alternative (for example).",1241174225

588319,comment,586782,587428,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"I'm looking at JVM performance optimisations at the moment (I'm working on cache-friendly data structures for DBMSs, and interested in how running this stuff on a JVM affects things).  As just a little test, I wrote an identical binary search in Java and C over a large array (with randomly increasing contents), with a very large number of iterations.  I pregenerated all the search numbers to eliminate discrepancies with regards to time taken for RNG.  It turned out that for completely predictable searches C was always a bit faster, and over smaller array sizes C also beat out java.  As the array got over about a million elements in size, Java caught up to and then got significantly faster than C.<p>On further investigation of a 150 million element dataset, Java was performing 1/3 again as many instructions, but missing cache half as much.  I've been spending some time looking at all the JVM performance optimisations, but I still haven't worked out why this is - a random binary search isn't exactly a test case that's run time optimisation-specific.  It's fascinating stuff, anyway.",1241172953

The risk is something happening to the rocket on the way up. It sounds absurd but there's a lot more radioactive things in space, and costs for such a procedure seem to be lowering.",1241172533

You also then have time off to use to improve yourself via school or some other way.<p>You are more than willing to pay more, but the very people you talk about who need cheap goods and services to stretch a budget don&#x27;t have that extra money.  The forcing of every job to be &quot;living wages&quot; removes a part of the labor force that is willing and able (due to parents or other income) to provide services for less money.  Removing part-time, dependent labor from the the market increases the costs of goods and services for everyone and screws poor people.  You might feel better, but it has a detrimental effect.<p>> If you&#x27;re working back-to-back jobs 80 hours a week that pay nothing you have zero time for yourself, zero time for good planning and zero time to attend any kind of classes.<p>This is a different issue.  This is the disappearance of full-time, low skill jobs.  There are many factors including changing laws that have impacted this area.  Our current bad economy and companies preparing for changes in health care laws are two.  Worsening the situation by raising the minimum wage is only going to get more people fired / hours reduced or speed automation (McDonald&#x27;s self ordering machines).<p>Doing something to help people get an education or training is one thing, eliminating a whole class of workers that make goods and services cheaper is a problem.<p>I remember the paper, and remember a negative reaction, but do not have time to read and find my sources on it again.",1418961223

The implications lead us to several interesting conclusions. First, emptying accounts is extremely hard: transferring money in a way that is irreversible can generally only be done in a way that cannot later be repudiated. Since password-enabled transfers can always be repudiated this explains the importance of mules, who accept bad transfers and initiate good ones. This suggests that it is the mule accounts rather than those of victims that are pillaged. We argue that passwords are not the bottle-neck, and are but one, and by no means the most important, ingredient in the cybercrime value chain.

In truth, though: pedigree shouldn&#x27;t matter, but it does.<p>Among the top 100 offerings or so, the differences in quality of education are very small. The differences in quality of <i>students</i> are pretty small. But connections matter, and even if Harvard student&#x27;s aren&#x27;t all shockingly brilliant, the dumb ones are <i>connected</i>.<p>If you go the #147 private college and pay $50k per year, you&#x27;d be better served by a state school. If you&#x27;re talking about Harvard, though... no, it&#x27;s not a waste of money.<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the influence of pedigree <i>increases</i> later in one&#x27;s career. These numbers are estimates, but an MIT CS grad might make $100k out of college while the state-school grad makes $85k-- not a huge difference. Ten years out, those numbers look more like $250k and $150k. Why? Connections tend to get <i>stronger</i> with time, even when not formally kept up. So much of the business world is run by nostalgia. That&#x27;s why prep school connections are more powerful than college, and college connections are more powerful than grad-school connections... even though the elite high schools are less selective and meritocratic. <i>Old</i> connections suggest predestination (&quot;born to lead&quot;) and, because of that, have a cachet that new connections (though carrying more signal) don&#x27;t. The future may be (and most hope it will be) rich and abundant but the past is a scarce and eternally limited commodity; there will never be more pedigree.<p>Where you went to school matters not at all, ten years out, if you&#x27;re in the top or bottom 10%, relative to where you might be expected to go with your training, career-wise. If you do really well, no one cares where you went to school. Or if you make terrible choices and fail catastrophically, the Harvard degree just makes it more pathetic. For that middle 80%, those connections made early on are going to start throwing &quot;Get Out Of Jail Free&quot; cards and that&#x27;s a major asset if you want to break the ceiling and become a player.<p>I&#x27;d say that it generally works like this. From 22-25, pedigree matters a lot in an evaluative sense. (Make that 22-29 if you get a PhD.) From 25-30, it doesn&#x27;t matter all that much because people have more recent data, when it comes to evaluation. From 30-40, it starts to matter again, not because people judge you based on it-- your record speaks for itself-- but because you&#x27;re vying for leadership or coveted creative/architectural roles and that means politics, and you need &quot;Get Out Of Jail Free&quot; cards (which come from having connections) for when your risks blow up. After 40, it seems to stop mattering because that&#x27;s an age at which you shouldn&#x27;t need &quot;Get Out Of Jail Free&quot; cards at all.",1418958985

If the one with the foul-up has and does contribute significant value, and <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> repeat the same mistakes, it&#x27;s a good call.<p>If the careful worker both avoids errors (and costly mistakes) <i>and</i> exceeds other engineers in contributing value, there&#x27;s a strong argument for keeping them.<p>There are people who simply foul things up.  And there are those who avoid mistakes by simply never taking risks.  You almost certainly want to discard the first.  The second&#x27;s value depends on the value your organization gains from innovation.",1418958140

A more effective approach is to redesign the language so those mistakes are impossible.<p>For example, the JSF C++ guidelines say not to use &#x27;l&#x27; suffixes on numeric literals, because they look like a 1. D simply makes the &#x27;l&#x27; suffix illegal, use &#x27;L&#x27; instead.",1418958091

I had CFS myself, and I was very open to the idea that it was caused by stress. I&#x27;ve also have IBS. Doctors didn&#x27;t have any useful suggestions, but I was able to eventually figure it out by myself. I think one of the problems is that doctors don&#x27;t really have the time necessary to deal with conditions like these. Certainly for conditions like CFS and IBS there are a lot of patients like me who are interested in finding the actual cause of their illness. I&#x27;ve never talked to any Morgellon&#x27;s patients, so I&#x27;m not sure what the ratio of open-minded to nutty patients is for that condition.",1418958039

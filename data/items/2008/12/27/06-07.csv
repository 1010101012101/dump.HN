I've been meaning to add some more optimistic readings/podcasts to my list.<p>China surpassed us recently, and the US losing its hegemon status is very bad for the dollar. The only thing they have left to do (and are doing) is build up their military. They do have quite a few domestic political problems though, but analysts were already confused how capitalism thrives in China anyway so there's no telling what will happen. I think\nthese problems and what they produce are the unknown factors that will determine the new world economy. That is just my pet theory.",1230360804

That is, cultures as diverse as India, China, England, Russia, pan-Arabic (i.e. non-Jews in the Middle East) have all viewed gold as having value, and that over at least 1000 years of recorded history each.<p>3. It does not corrode or rot the way paper money does. In Israel they recently found some Byzantine-era gold coins, aside from the obvious numismatic/collector value they still retain value for the gold itself.<p>4. Gold does not require a government to enforce its value. It's value is innate or intrinsic to the thing itself. As such if a government falls or decides to modify the value of a paper dollar (as Mexico, Argentina etc. have done in the past) then the value changes. Gold that you have in your pocket cannot have its value modified by a government order.",1230360792

410834,comment,410428,410428,0,0,strlen,,,"Given your price range and the fact you own a two seater, it seems you're looking for something sporty. I'd suggest:<p>Infiniti G35 or G37. The former can easily be gotten completely loaded for under $35k (and possibly out the door if you pay cash and go for an unsold 2008 model). The latter can be a little pricier, but not by much.<p>I've got a 2007 G35 Coupe. Fully-loaded (except for four wheel steering), stickshift. Intense amount of fun to drive.<p>Prior to that I've had a 2006 G35 Sedan (was rear-ended on US-101 and the car was totaled; which is why I couldn't wait for the G37 to come out, I needed something I could drive <i>soon</i>).<p>Simply put, this is the most fun with four seats (and the lack of insurance premium due to being a ""sports car"") you'll have for under $40,000. Rear-wheel drive (AWD available on the sedan), real stickshift available (unlike on the IS350), sporty suspension, limited slip differential (the BMW 335 - which is $10,000 more expensive doesn't include that).<p>The <i>big</i> downside is fuel mileage (if I stay in fifth and sixth as possible as possible I can get a little over 26mpg, which is still dismal). This is slightly better in the newer models, but still - if you're looking for a fuel efficient car this isn't it. It also requires 91 octane (older models could take 89 and below if with an automatic, but that's not recommended).<p>Other downside is small trunk space on the 2007 coupe (the sedan is much better; not sure about the 2008 g37 coupe).<p>Also buy used, unless you're looking to build credit - which may not be the best time for it. When I got my first G35 (the sedan), I a) could get a certified deposit for a rate that is higher than what I am paying for the car b) was less than a year out of college, with no credit history.",1230359694

Chemotherapy ""works"" by causing enough DNA damage that the body is better able to identify cancerous cells and destroy them.   Hardly an elegant solution.  It's important to note that even with chemotherapy, it's still the body itself actually dismantling the tumors.<p>In any case, it sounds like the dad already made his decision, and I can understand that.  Chemotherapy takes a tremendous toll of suffering, to the point that if the only alternatives were chemo and death, it's still not always an easy choice.<p>In general, the natural health approach is to support the body's healthiness in every way possible, such that it can do its job.  Our bodies dismantle plenty of cancers each day on their own.  That may seem simple, but it deserves more investigation than a cavalier dismissal for the sake of the child^h^h^h^h^h cancer patients.<p>So, to be clear, the alternative I'm suggesting is: Be willing to greatly change your died and lifestyle, and find a naturopathic doctor/clinic and work with them.  <a href=""http://www.naturopathic.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.naturopathic.org/</a>",1230358055

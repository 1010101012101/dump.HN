Even simple slides like ""Anyway."" that stay for just a second or two keep the viewer from getting distracted.<p>The whole ""less words more pictures"" philosophy has become really popular lately, and it seems this has taken it to a new level.<p>Bonus points for style and execution.",1229776748

I wouldn't call that no activity.  I have the same kind of account on Tumblr for the Indianapolis Colts; pictures I take when I'm at football games or interesting news clips.  It's not a dormant account.  So on that note, saying ""no activity"" isn't correct, he was apparently doing something with the accounts.",1229776496

It's a (bad) generalization just to help get the audience to the central point.",1229776182

We did put a lot of efforts in this startup and our resources are very limited, both in financial and human resources terms. Perfection at the moment it's well beyond us.
We mentioned the big Google with the intention to create some buzz and focus on the similarities between the two systems. Similarities that anybody can observe.
Anyway your point of view makes perfect sense and your feedback has extreme value for us, again sincere Thanks.",1229775234

He can probably afford the $20/month. It's cheaper than hip-hop dance class.",1229774712

8917165,comment,8915977,8915977,0,0,chillingeffect,,,"This is interesting, but if you really want to get user traction, look deeper into how the industry uses HDLs.<p>For example, one of the most common use cases is scaling code from year-to-year, e.g. the video card market.  This means that in 2012, your code works with 16 bits, then 2013, 32, then 2014, 64-bit etc.  And you need to keep updating your code to do this, having not touched it for just about six months - perfect time to be kind of familiar but not enough.  This is currently handled by integrating perl-like syntax into the HDL.  Then it gets &quot;pre-processed&quot; into the proper values in place.  It sounds clumsy , but it may be how the machine you&#x27;re using to read this was made.<p>A second important use case is integrating writing test code with the source code.  As the register, path widths, number of cycles, etc., change, the verification cases have to track.  If you could find a way to simplify that, companies would pay a LOT for it.<p>Another major problem becomes &quot;ifdef-hell&quot; in which sometimes dozens of hierarchical #ifdefs are used to compile and configure HDL code.  it&#x27;s maddening, hence the pre-processor approach.<p>So, in summary, it&#x27;s not the clumsy syntax of HDLs that slows progress, it&#x27;s the ecosystem in which the HDLs are used.",1421765756

8917158,comment,8916876,8916939,0,0,acadien,,,"It depends on the problem you&#x27;re working on and the number of variables you need to optimize.  If you only have <20 variables on a nice smooth surface then yeah a shotgun approach is probably going to work, then again pretty much anything is going to work on a problem of that size.<p>On the other hand if you&#x27;re working with >100 variables on a highly diverging surface you&#x27;re going to want an iterative approach. In particular you need something that is history dependent and avoids regions that have been previously searched. SA is great because its simple, iterative, insanely stable, has great breadth and depth searching properties and its easily modifiable.<p>In comparison approaches like GA might be faster to converge in some cases but because they&#x27;re more complex and system dependent its going to take longer to fine tune them to your particular problem.",1421765616

But I think the trends out there are deeply troubling. In 100 years, I want countries like the one my family is from to be like California, not Saudi Arabia. I think that would be good for them, but also good for us. But thanks to radical Islamists, the world is moving in the wrong direction.

Yes, HDL&#x27;s syntax might be awkward sometimes (whether it&#x27;s Verilog or VHDL) but I think you are tackling the wrong problems with the wrong way.<p>Taking the example you gave:<p>always @(negedge reset_n or posedge clock) begin<p><pre><code>  if (~reset_n) begin

    count <= 4&#x27;b0;

    FSM <= init;

  end else begin

    case (FSM)

      init: begin

        if (count != 4&#x27;h8) begin

          count <= count + 1;

          FSM <= init;

        end else

          FSM <= next_state;

     end

   next_state: // blah

  end
  
 end
</code></pre>
end<p>Can you point exactly what do you think it&#x27;s wrong with this syntax? And don&#x27;t compare it with a while() cycle in C, because this is a totally different thing. I&#x27;m not saying that this is the perfect way of doing things but there are good reasons why Verilog ended up this way.<p>I&#x27;m really scared with this whole &quot;Hardware design for software developers&quot; thing. Hardware design is very complex and if you aren&#x27;t careful with what you write, you might end with problems like: CDC, synthesis tools mistaking flip-flops with latches, problems with the insertion of scan chain, and so on.<p>And by the way, where do you define your clocks in Cx?",1421765432

I feel that it is this dichotomy that brings the most insight to the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.  Further, the post doesn&#x27;t give any good intuition on why it works, or how it works, or how it compares to alternatives... everything you would want to know.  It also gets other details not quite right, like the origin of the Gibbs measure (the name &quot;simulated annealing&quot; comes from analogy to the annealing process in metallurgy, but the Gibbs formulation comes from  probability theory, and the application here via the Ising model and electromagnetism).  This isn&#x27;t very important to a practical intro I guess, but it makes it harder to find the right places to read deeper if you wish to.<p>It&#x27;s fairly easy to prove that simulated annealing done &quot;properly&quot; will converge to a uniform distribution over all global minima. The &quot;properly&quot; here involves a logarithmic cooling schedule and a little thought should convince you that this is in practice not going to help you any more than exhaustive search will.<p>It&#x27;s very difficult to prove useful properties about convergence or distribution on faster cooling: therin lies the rub.<p>I suspect a big part of the popularity of the approach is that it is extremely easy to implement, but unfortunately naively application often doesn&#x27;t work very well on complicated energy state spaces.",1421764666

Of course I didn&#x27;t see anything strange. But I am routinely fouled by Venus. I&#x27;ve observed Venus at dawn thousands of times, but now and then it seems that there is a light following us. I look at it thinking it&#x27;s another airplane, then when I can&#x27;t identify it as such, I remember that I´m looking at Venus. It&#x27;s fun it happens after so many years knowing the phenomenon.<p>When I was a kid I used to live in the country, not far from the airport (my father was a commercial pilot too). It was common to see airliners doing a  visual landing traffic to land, passing just overhead. One afternoon, I was coming out to feed the dogs when I saw a very bright green light, just the same type of green that shines at the right wing of airplanes, but this light&#x27;s trajectory was 90º to the normal traffic one, and was heading away from the airport. At first I thought It was a crashing airplane, but it was completely silent. 
It was very weird, I stared at it for a minute or so, till it disappeared to the East. I thought then that it was a hight (and heavy) meteorite composed of Cu. 
Next day the local newspaper talked about it, how everybody reported it to the police, and how it was in fact a meteorite that brushed the higher atmosphere and rebounded again to the space.<p>If you are expecting or believing in alien UFOs, it´s easy to mistake something like this for a real UFO.

What&#x27;s more, he wasn&#x27;t writing when he was working for the post office initially, (and incidentally he was a letter carrier, meaning being outside). He left after 3 years, but returned a decade later after a divorce (and her subsequent death). Once he was back on the job, an old flame&#x27;s death prompted more writing, and over the next decade he continued to write, though one has to wonder if it was because of his office gig or in spite of it. At the end of the decade he quit so he could write full-time, which to me says that he both disliked his job and also couldn&#x27;t be completely creative while working there.<p>So while Einstein was directly inspired by the subject matter he reviewed at his job, Bukowski was driven by more personal motivations, along with perhaps a disgust with authority and human nature in general. Hard to say those are good anecdotals to defend the idea of general creative work being at all easy while working in a typical office job.",1421764435

8916947,comment,8916103,8916610,0,0,marios,,,"DNS blocking works quite well. It&#x27;s also very effective if you can set it up on your gateway so that it blocks ads/malware for all devices (PCs, phones, tablets ... even your guests will get adblocking for free!). However, while the /etc/hosts trick works I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best way. The reason is that while parsing a plaintext file is easy and generally fast, it doesn&#x27;t scale well especially when you have to traverse several megabytes of it for _every_ DNS request.<p>The way I have done it is by installing unbound[0]. If you aren&#x27;t using something else like dnsmasq, you will notice a speedup from the DNS caching alone. While unbound isn&#x27;t supposed to serve authoritative answers (i.e.: don&#x27;t use it to manage your zone) the possibility is there. The unbound-block-hosts script[1] can be used to convert Dan Pollocks&#x27; hosts file to the appropriate unbound syntax.<p>To avoid the timeout from localhost, my first approach was to setup a firewall rules that discards the request (the browser receives a connection refused message _immediately_)<p>Another way of proceeding is to setup nginx to serve a 1*1 transparent GIF for every request it receives. If you find nginx to be too big a dependency, there are alternatives such as  pixelserv[2].<p>The issue is that you can&#x27;t block a specific element, but you still catch a fair share of ads.<p>I have explored the possibility of running a http proxy to address this, but I haven&#x27;t got around to it yet. (In addition, I&#x27;ll probably need to MITM myself if I want to block elements in HTTPS; still needs some thinking :)).<p>[0] <a href=""https://unbound.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://unbound.net/</a>

They are installed in many gas stations in the US.  If you drive down the street and see a white dish on the roof, chances are my company did the install ;)  These links handle credit card transactions for paying at the pump and they also handle lottery purchases.<p>The industry wasn&#x27;t regulated very much until a situation in which some installers aiming dishes for EDJ (Edward Jones Financials) were knock things off line by aiming dishes at wrong satellites.  I don&#x27;t know much about how the technology works but it became apparent that aiming a dish at the wrong &quot;bird&quot; as we call them could interfere with others.<p>The EDJ thing was big news back in the day although a google search turns up nothing.  It reportedly knocked Edward Jones off line for something close to a week while many were deployed to go and re-aim satellite dishes.<p>After this incident, the FCC got more involved and now to install a two way satellite dish, you have to take a course and pass it.  My whole team was required to go through this training.<p>We also installed 2 way satellite internet for a company out of Canada that had a PCI card you plugged into your PC.  The PCI card would then connect to the dish transmitter and LNB.  The down speed was around 4-5Mb/s while the up speed was very slow at around 128Kb/s.  I forget the name of the company but they had a proprietary driver for the PCI card that compressed the TCP packets in order to deal with the huge latency of traveling up to space and back down.  They also had patents on a modified TCP/IP stack whereby they could locally ACK outbound TCP packets to improve throughput (as it was explained to me at the time).",1421762900

216498,comment,216381,216462,0,0,lg,,,"Well, I mentioned many-minds because a couple guys actually do take it seriously, even though most don't. But I think this entry is a little off when they say that many-minds ""extends"" many-worlds.  On the many-minds theory, there's only one world, which is pretty different on the face of it.  And since there are an infinite number of minds, if you get an 80-20 likelihood on values of some observable, then 80% of your minds will go to one and 20% to the other, which is very different from how many-worlds approaches splitting on outcomes.",1213325585

This is a function of personality.  It's very true that not everyone can work well virtually.

The talent pool is _much_ larger when it is national or international.  The hours are better for everyone.  One of my co-workers travels all over surfing in the mornings and working the rest of the day.  All your communication (assuming you aren't using the phone much) is logged and can be searched, which is quite handy for those brainstorming sessions.

Pitching a service or product to a potential client in person is obviously much different than providing the same person with information on that service through a web site or webinar. When face to face, you often can establish credibility and competence through your personal interaction. When a client looks for a service online, though, it is much harder to get a sense of those who are on the other end. The personal interaction, that personal “touch” is often lost online. Visitors are left to judge your service based on the information they read and what they see on your site.  If a user thinks your site lacks credibility, they will abandon your site and go elsewhere. On the other hand, there are methods you can employ to convey your company’s credibility online, so your clients can feel more comfortable. After all, who wouldn’t want to increase the number of conversions on their site?",1213322507

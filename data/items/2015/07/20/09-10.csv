What you have to remember, when choosing your development environment, is that there are always limitations to every platform. On the web that means you are always going to be sandboxed not only in what the application can do, but also in how it can interact with the user.

A complete smartphone OS powered by web technologies on a thin Linux layer.<p>So my point is: the “truly new stuff” is partly already out there, you just have to look. And partly it will hit your devices, when the browsers are evolved enough.

A few months prior, I took a taxi where, after I got in, the driver said if I wanted to use a credit card, he&#x27;d have to put it through one of those archaic credit card copy machines [1], so I had to bail and find another ride. And on a regular basis (once per week), taxis in San Franciso which are definitely available <i>drive right by me</i> when I&#x27;m attempting to hail. In NYC, a cab would have magically appeared from around the corner; in SF, taxi drivers do not even appear to want to get hailed.<p>Some are good here. And on average they probably are feeling heat from competition. But many of them are still abysmal.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/credit_card_swiper.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/credit...</a>",1437383032

I haven&#x27;t participated in open-source since 1999 (no, really) so I&#x27;m out of the loop with how things work in 2015.<p>But if I&#x27;m going to continue to shepherd this beast forward, there&#x27;s no point in hiding its flaws.  Besides, how will I know to fix them if I don&#x27;t document them?  Along those lines, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s clear the docs are still a WIP, and the more I&#x27;ve written the more I realize needs to be written.  I suspect the actual code won&#x27;t change one bit (ha!) over the next few weeks.<p>Regarding &quot;production credentials&quot;, the README mentions the company where this started, and I&#x27;ve alluded to some large (to me) round numbers.  Those will have to do for now.  :)<p>This sort of scenario (a PG index based on ES) isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d want to use for the scale of something like Netflix (for example) where you&#x27;ve got billions of rows and tens-of-thousands of queries a second.  But at the same time, that level of scale only happens at the top.  And it&#x27;s lonely up there.  There&#x27;s a lot more room down here on the ground.<p>----<p>While I&#x27;m sitting here at 4:30am waiting for HN to stop telling me I&#x27;m posting too quickly (wth, I&#x27;d like to get some sleep eventually!), here&#x27;s another thought...<p>Data is hard.  I&#x27;ve spent my entire professional career dealing with data.  Trying to bridge the gap between two distinct databases has proven really challenging (and fun and rewarding) but there&#x27;s quite a bit of work left to do, and there&#x27;s thousands of programmers out there that are waay smarter than I (starting with the entire crew of postgresql-hackers), so I feel like if I can at least list the things I know I don&#x27;t know, someone else may come along and have an answer.",1437382971

So I have written my cookbooks, and depending on the project, I converge (spinning-up) VMs depending only on cookbooks that I need, eg no java will be installed if the project requires node.js only. In addition the main gain with that, is my dev VMs are totally disposable and they own nothing. Everything is being synced into the VM from my host machine, same with data.<p>Lately I am trying to &quot;dockerize&quot; my backends, so in the case my workspace project needs a mongoDB or an other backend from my architecture, I should be pulling those containers up on converging. That will make my life easier when writting cookbooks for the backend dependencies.<p>I believe you can achieve the same using ansible, chef was a personal taste.",1437382940

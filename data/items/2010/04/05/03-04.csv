No, I am not talking about those scam emails where they claim that their stock pick is going to go up 100% in a month. I am talking about realizing those penny stock scams and 'shorting' them to your advantage. I learned about shorting penny stocks from Timothy Sykes (<a href=""http://www.timothysykes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timothysykes.com/</a>) and have made some money. There are quite a few other traders who share their knowledge through blogs.

""Previously I said X will happen because of Y, and X happened."" is basically ""Y implies X; X is true; therefore Y"".<p>Nevertheless, it is true that if a person makes a claim that something will happen for a given reason, gives plausible logical reasons, that we have priors that also indicate the causative connection is sound, and the prediction ultimately comes true, we should not just ignore it. We may not be justified in using Aristotelian logic to conclude with 100% confidence the person's reasoning was correct, but we are justified in taking it into account and concluding that there is some reason to believe this person, who made a prediction contrary to many people's other beliefs, may in fact have something.<p>After all, if you're not going to listen to people who make accurate predictions with plausible reasons used for their predictions, you can just give up on science right now, because that's all it is.",1270437936

I would allow some processes to spawn ""background services"" to play audio and maybe a couple other things.<p>They would be fully self-hosting machines with no dependence on a PC. Their data would sync to some type of cloud storage in some optimized semi-lazy way.

1241264,comment,1240734,1240734,0,0,mrcharles,,,"Game industry veteran here...<p>It's an interesting idea, but there's a some problems.  First, the crossover between those who need art in their spare time, and those who know how to contribute to projects like Blender.<p>In reality, the people (like me), who love making games and are constantly on the lookout for artists to help out with side projects, spend all of our time doing gameplay code.  Heavy 3d math, number crunching, data management -- that kind of stuff tends to fall under the category of things we don't like doing -- thus the expertise and passion for making games themselves.<p>On the flip side, the programmers with the ability to contribute to a project like blender, are the kind of programmers who are specialists in a particular field, and thus, from my experience, don't really branch out from that in to the kind of things that would need art on the side.<p>Granted, these are generalities, but I've been in the industry for eleven years and I've only met one person who crossed those boundaries (one Stan Melax, a dude smart enough to correct John Carmack and passionate enough to walk away from a job when it doesn't challenge or interest him).<p>Second, those of us who are passionate about making games and do need art, are often more interested in collaborations which further our side projects.  If I were to contribute to blender, this doesn't really get my own projects further.  At least, not in a parallel fashion, more it's like I'm doing the coding AND the art.  Only I'm trading unrelated coding for art. Really, game programmers who do this stuff on their own time are often selfish and/or extremely focused on our own projects.<p>Third, even if I did contribute to blender as a trade, the reality is that it doesn't further my skills in the direction I actually need for the stuff I do.  So ultimately, the whole thing is kind of more downside than upside.<p>Anyway, not to say it's not an interesting idea, and that it won't rope in a few people, but it's going to be hard to find those people, ultimately.",1270436969

Bush was in office for the worst of it<p>In this matter, Bush's sins are sins of omission - as you point out, he didn't do anything.  Dems did something, but what they did was wrong.  For example, they actively protected Fannie and Freddie.  Those are sins of comission.<p>Note that Bush didn't change the regulatory structure - he went with what Clinton left him.  Again - omission vs comission.<p>It's the difference between manslaughter and murder.<p>And, that's ignoring ACORN's role.  Among other things, they picketed banks that didn't make enough loans to folks who couldn't afford them.  They tried to intervene with regulators.  And so on.<p>Yes, Bush might have been able to keep this from happening, but he would have been fighting Dems the whole way.<p>He didn't fight.  They pushed bad policies.

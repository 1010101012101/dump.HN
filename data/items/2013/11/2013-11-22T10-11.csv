6780154,comment,6777517,6777517,2,0,ermintrude,,,"I&#x27;m working on a large project running on AWS. We&#x27;re building an n-tier architecture with many roles in auto-scaling groups.<p>We wasted the first couple of months writing wrappers around SSH to let us provision servers with salt, which if we&#x27;d been using ansible would have been completely unnecessary. We did evaluate ansible at the start of the year, but at that time it didn&#x27;t look quite as mature so we went with salt.<p>I&#x27;ve used ansible myself and it&#x27;s far simpler than salt, and quicker to get started with. Admittedly I haven&#x27;t used it to deploy the same complex software as we are doing with salt, where orchestration is fiddly. Overall, the thing that lets salt down is its appalling documentation, poor support (the IRC channel has been practically useless) and complex terminology (what&#x27;s the difference between a module and a state? Who knows...).<p>Salt does have one thing in its favour though - the ability to run things in parallel. For example a new node can request itself to be configured which is very useful when running in auto-scaling groups. I think this is coming in ansible, but it wasn&#x27;t at the same level as in salt last I checked.<p>With salt, when a new node comes up (in an auto-scaling group for example), it can request itself to be configured. Once finished it can fire an event to the saltmaster which can trigger it to reconfigure other nodes. This, for example, means when a new web server comes up, the app can be deployed to it and the node can then instruct the saltmaster to update the load balancer configs to send traffic to it. This event system is powerful because it lets multiple tasks take place in parallel, but it is complicated.<p>If ansible had an intuitive way of running tasks in parallel (with locks through critical sections, the ability to target a subset of matched nodes (to back up a single server in a pool for example), etc.), then I think it&#x27;d beat salt hands down.<p>For the majority of cases I&#x27;d definitely recommend ansible over salt. And as for chef/puppet after using them both on earlier projects, we started looking for something else that could do orchestrations as well as provisioning and that had saner authentication when running in the cloud.<p>Good work ansible team!",1385117570

6780098,comment,6777517,6780007,2,0,lutusp,,,"> The other side of this is that in syntaxes which have some other hierarchical delimiter (such as curly braces), it is quite a common mistake for a human to see one thing, and for the computer to interpret another.<p>Yes, but in the case of explicit delimiters, the situation can be resolved fully and automatically by counting delimiters -- either there are an equal number of delimiters (i.e. N(&#x27;{&#x27;) - N(&#x27;}&#x27;) == 0) or there aren&#x27;t. The computer can be relied on to discover this simple relationship and raise an alarm, one that puts the error before the programmer in unambiguous form.<p>By contrast, in Python, in many cases the program compiles, runs, and produces a different result than if the error were not present. The program is syntactically correct in both forms, but its meaning has changed. In the Python case, the program may have a different meaning, and produce a different result, than the human intended without an alarm being raised.<p>> At least with whitespace, what you see is what the computer also sees.<p>Depending on what you mean by &quot;see&quot;, not necessarily so. The programmer may intend something that that program, as written, cannot produce, because of an ambiguity related to the lack of formal delimiters, an ambiguity that causes the computer to understand the program differently than the human, and produce results that the human didn&#x27;t intend.<p>All this apart from the nightmare produced by mixing tabs and spaces in the same source file. This may seem an unrelated issue at first glance, but mixing tabs and spaces in a language that uses explicit delimiters is just bad practice, but in Python (and in YAML) it can be a very serious problem. It&#x27;s why Google&#x27;s published syntax guidelines forbid use of tabs.<p>When tabs are used, two standard tabs produce a 16-character-space indentation and two syntactic indentations. When spaces are used, two spaces produce two character-space indentations and one syntactic indentation (by Google&#x27;s standards, i.e. two-space indentations).

It simply mean that the secret law can be ignored, and where those with privileged access can gain an market advantage.<p>Either the law makers is in fault here for making part of the law secret, or DIN should loose their copyright to the standard. You can not have laws with open and secret parts, or you creates a law enforced unfair market.<p>If DIN has proprietary ownership of the optional part of the law, DIN can then at their choice exclude companies at will. After all, proprietary ownership means the right to not sell a license to companies of your choice. This is clearly incompatible with a fair and free market.<p>In my view, the law should be rewritten so the standard is not included there. If the market want to make the standard an industry practice, or lawyers want to view it as the defined compliance to the law, then thats fine. That would mean that a competing standard writing body (or lawyer firm) could come up with a new standard, and compete in an fair and free market with the first one. As it is now, no such competition can happen since the standard is written into the actually law as a way to optional be in compliance.

Breaking down power hierarchies and reconcieving leadership in the way Rand eloquently describes here requires constant conscious effort and innovation in information flows, communication, delegation, and decision-making.<p>Through practice, we&#x27;ve come to the very same conclusion that the fallacy at work in traditional hierarchical organisations that fail by many humanistic measures (happiness, creativity, autonomy) is not that management and leadership are important - they absolutely are - but that the people who perform those functions should be placed higher on some sort of pyramid and paid more, and that the work of management should be necessarily embodied in specific <i>people</i> as opposed to a function that can be spread amongst many, according to their specific abilities and capacity.<p>We&#x27;re still working out the specific mechanics and processes, but we&#x27;re making headway.

A full snapshot of the source data for a game like Battlefield 4 is likely to be on the order of hundreds of GB, maybe getting up to the TB range. And if multiple teams are working on the same source data, then the source data needs to be sent between them.<p>Also, before the final few months of development, games&#x27; runtime data will often significantly exceed the final shipped size because compression and quality tradeoffs have not been decided and applied.",1385115291

I&#x27;ve done a lot of work in both and found that while python&#x27;s memory performance may not be ideal, at least when you run into trouble in python you have options. With matlab I found that when I got that dreaded &quot;Out of memory&quot; message the prompt, there was little I could do. The internals are completely opaque, shipping my code to C is a pain in the ass, and there are very few language constructs to help you control how you use memory.<p>In most cases running out of memory in matlab meant either making the problem smaller or running it on a beefier machine. I think this is the reason why you see a lot of labs at universities with machines that have 96GB of memory, even though their datasets seem to be much smaller.<p>FWIW, as far as processing lots of data is concerned, python is not without issues. If you do it naively you will run out of memory <i>really</i> quickly. But by picking your tools correctly you can go a long way. Use Pandas and/or Sparse arrays whenever possible. Learn how numpy broadcasting operations contribute to memory explosions. Take a gander at the source of that sklearn method you&#x27;re using, since it&#x27;s often quite obvious that the particular implementation will choke.<p>I&#x27;ve found that these days I try my best to avoid loading datasets into memory. This is second nature for people who work with &#x27;big data&#x27;, but it&#x27;s an m.o. that takes some getting used to. That is, blocking and/or streaming your data, and appropriately subdividing your problem for distributed computation. It&#x27;s worth mentioning that this problem with python is under active research and development. The guys at continuum developed IOpro to deal with the issue of memory efficiency when loading data, and to make streaming data from flat files/S3/mongodb/whatever easier and more stable. Also, their (very young) project called Blaze is meant to be a drop-in replacement for numpy, but is designed for efficiency and specifically for dealing with out-of-core computation. We&#x27;ll see...",1385114745

As another comment said, this is essentially RSync, not git.<p>I&#x27;ve been out of game development for a year, but unfortunately git is not being taken up much by large game developers. The main reason cited is actually git&#x27;s handling of binary files, which leads to every checkout containing many duplicates of huge files. However this is possible to work around and the benefits of git still make it worth it.",1385114741

6780017,comment,6779323,6779450,9,0,sveme,,,"Similar to me. I started with MATLAB (I even worked for them for a time), but then moved to Python when I started working more in Bioinformatics and lately explore Julia a lot. The current issue with Julia is that most of the tutorials and docs available on the web are targeted at developers, not users, and therefore has a hard time converting the more casual MATLAB and, to a lesser degree, Python users.  The major advantage of MATLAB over any of the other languages is its integration with the MATLAB Desktop and the casual simplicity for non-programmers. I don&#x27;t really have to worry about data types, it seems to be working out of the box (which is an advantage for beginners but a serious handicap at a later stage). Julia has a higher initial barrier to adoption with its many different paths to success). Though I suspect that especially with its macros julia will be able to create extremely intuitive and expressive packages for all kinds of problem domains.<p>I think a good start for julia would be to include more workflow-oriented tutorials in the docs that also provide a path through the current mess of packages (220 at current count, with sometimes quite redundant functionality, e.g., Gadfly, Winston, pyplot, Gaston). Heck, maybe I should just help with it once I&#x27;m done with my current project.",1385114558

(Its my first job after graduation). So obviously that was a privilege, but it truly is hellishly boring. I was so disconnected with my team.<p>Eventually i got shifted to sit with my team in an open space and its really great. It&#x27;s a small enough room with around 20 people, people sitting in teams. i suppose The presence of other teams can be a bit distracting at times, but it also gives you more people to interact with. You get a grasp on more than just your current assignment. You connect with more people than just your current team. So it ain&#x27;t all bad. there are pros and cons.

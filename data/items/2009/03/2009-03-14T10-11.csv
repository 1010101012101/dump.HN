It's certainly not a nice way to behave IMHO.<p>The issue though is that domain names are pretty much free to register, but obviously have a far higher value to some people - a loophole that people exploit to make a quick buck.<p>The other funny disconnect is how little traffic some ""premium"" domains get.<p>>> ""Greetings.com, but Ham grabs it anyway, for $350,000.""<p>Quantcast says it gets 8,100 US visitors a month.",1237028060

And, to the best of my knowledge, the twitter-fan girl was the first one to try this approach.<p>Still, it would be funny if some start-up created a website named ""Sequoia should fund us"" or something like that. After all, it's all a marketing stunt, right?",1237026641

Really I have just stopped moving much music because of this reason, plus I only have windows on an older machine I don't use much.

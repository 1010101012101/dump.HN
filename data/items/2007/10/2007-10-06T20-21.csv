You say specific startup hubs are important, but specific colleges are not?  Bullshit, either both are important or both are not.  By your own arguments they will be performing the same service, building communities.<p>You say one goes to Silicon Valley to be in a community of startups, meet cofounders and talk with smart people.
Then you say that in the future, in college, we will be more concerned with meeting cofounders and communing with smart people than we will be concerned with grades.
Why won't yo want to go to the school with all the smartest like-minded people?
Thats what Harvard is to business people.  A community of like minded people that band together to help each other.
The same will be created at the new breed of startup oriented tech schools.  The admission standards might be a tiny bit different though.

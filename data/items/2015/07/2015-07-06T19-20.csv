I consider myself to be smart, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m on that level.<p>And sure, like you and I both said, I can build a product (I&#x27;m trying as we speak like everyone else is on HN) to develop my marketing skills, but then lets face it... if it&#x27;s actually worth doing, my job isn&#x27;t going to be primarily about marketing; it will be about leading a team, building a great product, and yes a bit of marketing.<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Master"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Master</a>",1436212786

9841775,comment,9838724,9838724,0,0,hackuser,,,"One big advantage of Google&#x27;s solution over Uber&#x27;s is the relative climate change impact of your transportation choice. In reverse order of benefit, based on my amatuer analysis:<p>* For a baseline, let&#x27;s use one party (generally a person or a couple) with a personal car. Traveling someplace creates P marginal greenhouse gasses (GHG), plus there is the fixed cost of manufacturing the car (but I have no idea how much that is).<p>* Uber and taxis net GHG emissions should be worst and greater than P: Your trip uses P but added to that is the GHG generated when the taxi/Uber car has no passenger and is &#x27;cruising&#x27;. Also, I expect taxis/Uber cars are larger on average than personal cars, and thus less fuel efficient, because they need to fit several adults comfortably in the back. If you give up a personal car for Uber/taxis, then you get the manufacturing benefit.<p>* Car share services (e.g., ZipCar) should net less than P emissions, if you give up a personal car when you join. The car is parked when nobody is driving it, so the marginal cost of one trip is P. But it also eliminates the emissions created from manufacturing the car, whatever that is. EDIT: As hayksaakian points out below, this is the same as buying a used car.<p>* Google&#x27;s RideWidth&#x27;s net GHG emissions should be much less than P: For every added passenger, one less car is on the road emitting P.<p>* Public transit probably is second best. The marginal GHG emissions of the bus/train carrying your fat a-- on its normal route probably don&#x27;t amount to much. On the other hand, it probably depends on the average passenger load of the vehicle -- certainly a train/bus with only you on it costs much more per passenger than P, but those fixed costs are spread over many more passengers than Uber/taxis.<p>* Best of all, of course, are biking or walking. Though has anyone calculated the GHG emissions of the human energy cycle, from growing the cattle feed to transport to refrigeration to cooking to human methane emissions?<p>Also not calculated are the effect your use of one service or another has on demand, driving up the number of Uber/taxi/busses, etc. on the road.",1436212491

Android&#x27;s WebView literally was the system browser until Chrome was released complete with the JIT since Froyo (V8) and hardware rendering since Honeycomb. And the first several versions of Chrome on Android had much worse performance than the old WebView did.<p>This aside the bulk of HTML content is still software-rendered. It&#x27;s software-rendered into tiles which are then GPU composited.

As I understand Victoria&#x27;s position, a full salary went to hand-hold celebrities during AMAs. That&#x27;s a lot to spend for a portion of the participants in one subreddit (I don&#x27;t think every AMA got that support).<p>Given limited resources, that meant that a salary&#x27;s worth of resources were not available to help pay a software developer who could be working on better mod tools--which would benefit every mod on the entire site.<p>That might be the entire story behind Victoria&#x27;s dismissal: reallocating money from hand-holding to software development.

I have no personal animosity toward her however I dont think she is the right leader for reddit. And I say that as a user, not an owner, shareholder, employee etc. My reasons are because I like they way the old reddit operated. The reason that I say that is because when I started using reddit the free speech ethic was proudly trumpeted. This was around the time of the DeCSS key event that started the downfall of Digg.<p>Even up to as recently as 2012 Yishan Wong was reaffirming reddits commitment as a free speech platform. This was around the time of the r/jailbait takedown. But really that was the beginning of the end, r/jailbait was shut down because of illegal content being posted. I never saw definitive proof of that and I dont think any was offered. This was about the time that there was media interest in reddit (and to be fair r/jailabit was one of the more embarassing links that could and did show up on a google search for reddit). So it went and with it the start of a slippery slope of censorship began.<p>After r/jailabit (which the majority of users agreed with) there was the fappening, again a lot of users agreed, but all these agreeable users were relatively new, they were here for cat pictures and memes. They didnt care about reddit as a free speech platform because their interests were not affected. Then we arrive at r/fatpeoplehate being banned. This went because of &#x27;harassment&#x27;.<p>Now we are at a stage where reddit is going to be kept clean and media friendly. It is not a free speech site (and I dont need to hear about free speech does not have to be protected by a businesss, i know that) even though it started off like that and it attracted a lot of users like that and those users built the communities that make reddit thrive.<p>I dont post that often anymore, i very rarely submit content anymore, I am not as attached to my accounts as I used to be. I am looking for alternatives because the site has changed so much (and so has the userbase) that the content it now has is no longer as relevant as it once was and this is only going to continue under the current leadership, and once a certain point is passed there is no getting it back.

However, I&#x27;d be much more willing to defend the idea that, as it appears here, &quot;hiking&quot; is a one-word noun phrase containing a verb form (and that compound nouns are formed NP-NP, not N-N). Traditional grammar has gifted us with a rich vocabulary of specialized terms for specialized syntactic functions, and the traditional term for a verb form which functions as a noun is &quot;gerund&quot;. (Um, technically, infinitive forms can also function as nouns.)<p>I&#x27;ll pause here to defend myself from an argument you haven&#x27;t made: there are people who will say that &quot;beef&quot; in &quot;beef stew&quot; is an adjective simply because it modifies a noun. They&#x27;re wrong. I say that a gerund really is a verb form acting as a noun. The difference is that I&#x27;m saying that gerunds can appear in basically all syntactic contexts that permit noun phrases, so the definition I&#x27;m using is syntactic (as appropriate for a syntactic term of art like &quot;noun&quot;) rather than semantic. I&#x27;m not saying gerunds are nouns because they refer to objects -- I&#x27;m saying they&#x27;re nouns because they can be the subjects of verbs (and otherwise appear where nouns appear). To me, the best analysis is just that noun phrases can be constructed from verb forms. Linking back to the subject at hand, I&#x27;d agree that &quot;hiking&quot;, the word, is not a noun in the same way that &quot;iron&quot;, the word, is one, but I am saying that this &quot;hiking&quot;, as used in context, is just as much of a noun phrase as &quot;this rusted iron&quot; is.<p>> Specifically, when looking at the list &quot;crummy old worn-out tan leather gusseted hiking&quot;, with modifiers lined up in order of significance, what about the word &quot;hiking&quot; jumps out at you as plainly different in use or meaning?<p>In all honesty, what jumps out at me is that all of the others are descriptions, while it would be odd to use &quot;hiking&quot; that way. For example, in a certain style of speech, you could see something like this:<p><pre><code>    Get out and take your crummy, old, worn-out, leather, gusseted, boots with you.
</code></pre>
(In actual rhetoric, the descriptors would probably be different.)<p>But it&#x27;s completely impossible for the &quot;hiking&quot; of &quot;hiking boots&quot; to be delimited by commas (in speech, emphatic pauses) that way. If you did it, the meaning of &quot;hiking&quot; would change -- it would mean that the boots were out on a hike. This demonstrates that &quot;hiking&quot; is not a descriptor for &quot;boots&quot; -- rather, &quot;hiking boots&quot; is a single unit. (Yes, with internal structure.)<p>> To me, the most intellectually honest thing is to see compound nouns as a sort of epicycle-style theory to explain why words in our non-modifier class are actually used as modifiers all the time, just according to a subtly different set of rules than applies to the modifier class.<p>English is way more liberal with modifiers than that.<p><pre><code>    He gave me his I&#x27;m-going-to-kill-you look.

Solid legal analysis, but an ordinary person would say that he got off on a technicality.&quot;<p>Although my central point was indeed regarding the FBI&#x27;s outsourcing of its investigation to Goldman Sachs, a private corporation and interested party, which seemed to offend fundamental notions of justice.<p>But the discussion most definitely significantly touched upon the legality of Aleynikov&#x27;s actions.<p>See e.g. Rhino paraphrasing Rayiner&#x27;s analysis:
>&quot;<i>Aleynikov definitely violated New York trade secret law.</i><p>He got off the federal charge because the trading software wasn&#x27;t a product for sale, it was a product for internal use. The law was poorly drafted and once that came to light it was immediately fixed.<p>Like Rayiner said, in layman&#x27;s terms, he got off on a technicality.&quot;<p>Or Rayiner himself:
>&quot;That was his defense. But the jury found that he had in fact grabbed valuable proprietary software, and the Second Circuit agreed that the 500,000 lines that he uploaded were mostly proprietary, valuable code.&quot;<p>For example, this exchange:<p>&quot;tptacek: >I have a passing understanding of the policies and procedures binding on developers at trading firms.
I dispute the idea that any senior developer could work at Goldman Sachs on an HFT infrastructure and believe that they were authorized to --- or, indeed, that they would not be immeditely fired for --- uploading the code to a proprietary automated trading system to a random SVN host in a different country. This is the code we, as security testers, were never allowed to see, even after owning up the machines hosting it. These firms are not kidding around about this stuff. It is a huge smoking gun to have uploaded any of it to some off-brand foreign svn host.<p>These are firms where you can be fired for plugging a thumb drive into your computer, or for using the company network to access Dropbox. I have worked for more than one financial firm that spent literally millions of dollars merely on the problem of detecting their network users trying to reach Google Mail.
I also dispute the idea that because developers commonly use ssh, gzip, and svn, that it is common practice to (1) gzip a tarball of source code, (2) encrypt that source code, (3) commit that compressed encrypted blob to svn, (4) remove all traces of the encryption key from their work computer. That&#x27;s something happens zero times on normal dev machines.
The conviction was overturned because the technical details of exactly what Aleynikov took from GS didn&#x27;t fit the ambitious charge the DOJ filed against him. But the appeal doesn&#x27;t refute the finding of facts from the original trial, which include:
There was more than sufficient evidence presented at trial, however, for a rational juror to conclude that Aleynikov intended to steal Goldman Sachs&#x27; proprietary source code. First, it was undisputed at trial that Aleynikov actually did take proprietary source code from Goldman Sachs. As Aleynikov concedes in his motion papers, the code he took from Goldman Sachs included a “purposefully designed” portion of the Goldman Sachs “proprietary, custom-built trading system.” Indeed, the evidence showed that Aleynikov took a significant percentage of the proprietary source code for that system. While Aleynikov attempted to show that there was open source code embedded within the proprietary code and to identify the files in which that might be true, his expert witness was only able to identify one file among those taken by Aleynikov that both bore a Goldman Sachs copyright banner and appeared to contain open source code.<p>I&#x27;m just fine with Aleynikov&#x27;s conviction being overturned. Again, the charges against him seemed ambitious.
But this is a forum full of software developers.<p>Rayiner is a lawyer and a compiler developer. It&#x27;s somewhat insulting to everyone&#x27;s intelligence to pretend that people here are unfamiliar with ssh and svn. We understand how software development works. What happened here was extremely sketchy. You can&#x27;t play the &quot;well in the world of software development, this is totally normal&quot; card on HN.&quot;&quot;<p>s_q_b: > &quot;...Agreed, but it was established that he did this fairly consistently throughout the course of his employment. It&#x27;s idiosyncratic, but not unexplainable. Sure, it was poor development practice, but I&#x27;m not convinced it was malicious.<p>Again, if the intent was trade secret theft, why not take the valuable part, the trading strategies?&quot;<p>I held that his actions violated neither state nor Federal law, so I&#x27;m razzing those that insisted his action were criminal, just a bit, all intended in fun. Perhaps the language could have used a bit of softening :)",1436211221

Anyone who&#x27;s been in Silicon Valley long enough will have seen this in many other forms (I know I have), although perhaps not as high profile as this one.<p>The success of Reddit is directly attributable to high profile subs (/r/AskScience, /r/AskHistorians, /r/AMA, /r/ListenToThis, etc.) and less visible but still well run subs that cater to more niche interests/topics (/r/MakeupAddiction, /r/PersonalFinance, etc.). Those subreddits would not exist without the thousands of man hours put in by moderators who are volunteers (modulo a few exceptions, such as Victoria). Anyone who has moderated an internet community knows how much sweat, effort, time, and pain go into maintaining a high quality community, and how crucial it is to keep your moderators happy and make them feel like their effort is valued.<p>The fact that the people running Reddit do not seem to realize that is a perfectly valid reason for the user base to be angry.  A lot of Silicon Valley executives like to think of their company+product as some neat little money making machine that sits in a vacuum and that they can tweak and modify as they like. But the reality is that building a community platform like Reddit is very different from running a sausage factory. You can run your sausage factory in to the ground, and the sausages won&#x27;t complain (the workers might, but the US does a pretty good job at avoiding that through strict control on labor unions). But when you start shitting on Reddit, the users will complain and protest - after all, you might control the code and the servers, but the community as a whole has contributed much more than you have to the end product.<p>You can&#x27;t separate &quot;reddit&quot; and &quot;the community&quot; like some commenters here are doing. This dualism makes no sense - reddit and its community are the same thing. You can&#x27;t have the thoughtful, well run threads on /r/AskScience without the dumb jokes on /r/funny.<p>Ellen Pao and friends do not seem to grasp those subtleties (this apology is just damage control), and it lead to the complete disaster we are seeing right now. This isn&#x27;t rocket science - in fact the Reddit community is quite predictable. Any Reddit user would have been able to tell you how the community was going to react to these actions. The fact that Ellen Pao has some shady connections (her husband not being in jail because he has enough money is a good first example) is just more fuel on top of the fire. This was extremely easy to predict, and the fact that the Reddit leadership seems to be completely clueless about it is a very bad sign for things to come. The reddit community didn&#x27;t have a problem with kn0thing, yishan, and others because they were first and foremost reddit users and know how to interact with the community. It&#x27;s not the case for the current people in charge.<p>The community has every right to be up in arms. And if you think that the Reddit community is shit and don&#x27;t spend time there, like some commenters here state, then what makes you feel like your input has any sort of relevance?<p>This isn&#x27;t a technology or management fiasco - it&#x27;s a political debacle. At a community interaction level, it&#x27;s not very different from taking someone with arbitrary credentials and putting them in charge of a country they&#x27;re completely unfamiliar with in the hope that they&#x27;re going to make that country a peaceful democracy. It just doesn&#x27;t work - you need the leadership to come from the community for it to have any lasting chance.",1436210458

There is a sink or swim mentality, which can be effective, but as the company grows it’s tougher to reward the swimmers and not have their work obfuscated by politicians.   It’s also tough to promote cross team collaboration in this environment.<p>Building something from nothing is tough, and so is turning an elite team into multiple elite teams.  It strikes me as the latter gets less focus in SV since it is much less frequent and goes against the entrepreneurial grain.  It’s easier to bash large companies than to think about how to actually build one.<p>I recognize that I’m likely missing relevant factors, but some of the key problems seem to be a flat org, no VP of engineering, and no encouragement of cross team work.<p>When managing people, you really need to meet with more than one level below you.  In a flat org, with 20 people reporting to the CEO and 40 people reporting to each of them, there is no way for the CEO to meet with all 800 people.   The CEO just ends up having to blindly trust his or her direct reports that everything is good.  A few bad ones can result in large sections of the company rotting from within.<p>Promoting cross team collaboration is tough.  A company needs to emphasize this in how it promotes / rewards people and crafts the org chart.  Easier said than done, but no VP of Engineering and directors promoting loyalists with no emphasis on helping other teams doesn’t help.  Having multiple directors involved in promotions may help.<p>I like the CEO and think that he does care.   He may be able to fix things, but unfortunately I don’t see it happening.  I am tired of hearing everyone complain and find myself getting angry at nice people that I like due to bad incentives.  My only option is to vote with my feet.

9841439,comment,9838196,9840582,0,0,kmill,,,"As another commenter mentions, MIT used MIT/GNU Scheme [1] for the introduction to CS class 6.001, so if you&#x27;re following SICP, this is probably the least-friction distribution of Scheme to be using (hints: use rlwrap, or use scheme-mode in emacs, or figure out how to use its built-in scheme-based emacs clone &quot;edwin&quot;).<p>MIT ran(/runs?) a one-month short course covering material from 6.001, and they used PLT Scheme when I took it (now Racket).  I seem to remember needing to go into one of the rnrs language modes to get things like mutable cons cells.  (How impure.)  From what I understand, MIT Scheme is much more in the Maclisp tradition, vs. Racket being more from programming language theory (though both are firmly rooted in the Scheme standard), which reflects in their extensions to the core language.<p>Nowadays, there is no equivalent to 6.001 at MIT, except maybe 6.945 can substitute.  They have a survey course sequence 6.01/6.02 which covers EECS in general, using Python when programming is needed.  As a challenge exercise you can make an interpreter for a language, though that&#x27;s not very metacircular.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/</a>",1436209589

9841434,comment,9835937,9840957,0,0,Cushman,,,"Well, yeah, I jumped in to defend the idea that the word &quot;the&quot; counts as an <i>adjective</i>. It seems vaguely possible that my argument is not backed by much besides bluster. (And of course the downvotes are my just reward.)<p>To the extent I&#x27;m arguing something non-disingenuous, it&#x27;s just that language is best analyzed with a bit of a fuzzy lens, and words don&#x27;t fit into neat boxes.<p>Take your claim that &quot;hiking&quot; is a noun: To me, it analyzes as an inflection of a verb (&quot;hike&quot;) that can be used to indicate an action (&quot;I was hiking&quot;), the performer or target of an action (&quot;I don&#x27;t hate hiking, hiking hates me&quot;) or as a modifier for something else (&quot;those crummy old worn-out tan leather gusseted hiking boots&quot;).<p>On what basis do you say that it <i>is</i> a noun? Specifically, when looking at the list &quot;crummy old worn-out tan leather gusseted hiking&quot;, with modifiers lined up in order of significance, what about the word &quot;hiking&quot; jumps out at you as plainly different in use or meaning? &quot;The boots aren&#x27;t hiking, they&#x27;re <i>for</i> hiking&quot;? Clearly-- in this phrase, the word &quot;hiking&quot; <i>means</i> the boots are for hiking!<p>To me, the most intellectually honest thing is to see compound nouns as a sort of epicycle-style theory to explain why words in our non-modifier class are actually used as modifiers all the time, just according to a subtly different set of rules than applies to the modifier class. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything really wrong with that, since it explains things well enough and we might never have something like universal gravitation to set the record straight.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is, I don&#x27;t think I have a problem.<p>Except, of course, when the &quot;rules of grammar&quot; are used as a proxy to cast minorities and lower-class people as unintelligent. That, I have a problem with, and it&#x27;s quite a popular pastime in the English-speaking world. That&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s important to think scientifically about the extent to which grammar is, and is <i>not</i>, a real thing.

For easy installation, you can run install_dependencies.sh in linux to install  all the required dependencies. For the rest, please check the README.
Yes, i have not been able to benchmark the performance, write test cases (which i will do in the days to come), yet i would like to know your take on the project.",1329994714

They are strong in a different segment of the market and we feel strongly that it would be very hard for them to get our part of the market without our acquisition.<p>We are not prepared to sell if the offer is under certain multiple but they dont want to disclose the bid unless we provide them with detailed information. We are worried that its just a fishing expedition to get more details how our business operates. They supplied NDA to sign which should protect us. In theory, but in practice I am not that convinced.<p>The sale price would be in 7 figures. I am toying with an idea to get from them like %0.5 sale price nonrefundable deposit and disclosing the minimum multiple they need to offer.<p>I am aware that it may put them off, but we are not looking to sell and just worried about disclosing information if it does not lead anywhere.<p>Has it ever been done? Is it a mad idea to ask for this? Am I better off just giving them information and proactively trying to contact other potential buyers to drive up a price instead?",1329994551

The GPL3 goes a step further and grants the user a license for any patents you have a license for whether its your own or one you licensed from somebody else.   Since neither situation likely applies in your case, the BSD and Apache licenses are basically functionally identical.   However, by choosing the Apache license you are telling potential users that you don't have any ""sleeper"" patents, so you might get better uptake.<p>If somebody later asserts a patent against your code, both you and your users are screwed no matter what license you choose.

3624461,comment,3623475,3623700,1,0,JonnieCache,,,"A factor in the prevalence of compression in popular music that is not often mentioned is the effects of the music production technology, specifically the cheap akai samplers that were used a lot in the 1980s and 90s. They only had a 12 bit sample rate and so had a very small dynamic range. This led to a fetishisation of the ""chunky"" sound it imparted on samples, especially drums. Then producers seeking this effect further compressed their samples to make them sound even chunkier. Here's an example from 1995: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fkWMrw4nFY#t=1m39s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fkWMrw4nFY#t=1m39s</a> and another from 1993: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu9Ml51vDrM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu9Ml51vDrM</a><p>In these scenarios, over-compression is a legitimate artistic choice: it's meant to sound like that.

Levitt explain, among other things, the odd economic behavior that guides many drug dealers. In one gang they described, the typical street-corner guy made less than minimum wage but still worked extremely hard in hopes of some day becoming one of the few wildly rich kingpins. This behavior isnt isolated to illegal activity. There are a number of professions in which workers are paid, in part, with a figurative lottery ticket. The worker accepts a lower-paying job in exchange for a slim but real chance of a large, future payday.</i><p>This example is indeed listed in ""Freakonomics"" and was contributed to the book by a sociologist called Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh. What this paragraph fails to say, however, is that the chapter in the book makes it clear the ""soldiers"" slinging on the corners either had the option of taking a minimum wage job working 9-5 plus overtime or taking the minimum wage ""job"" slinging and have a chance at making it big time PLUS the gang provided certain social services and security to their members and their families - something the minimum wage 9-5 job also did not have to offer. So while they were clearly in a tight spot, they took the more economic of the two options. And the guy leading the gang was described as very capable, social, if I remember correctly he even had finished school or was working on a degree and was capable of handling all financial matters of the gang. So his skills, qualifications and killings got him the job but ultimately his performance kept him there - otherwise he would have been replaced long ago. Clearly he had something more to offer over his soldiers.<p>A point this chapter was making was that these jobs take practically zero skill, have no entry-level barriers and there is an abundance of people willing to do them who don't have other options - that's why they the pay was so absolutely terrible while the job of being injured or killed on the job was ten-folds more likely than the most dangerous, ""regular"" job in the States.",1329992588

The various org-insinuate functions, the packages to hook it into magit (or rather ST2's equivalents) & Mew, etc. are all pretty important to me.  I haven't looked deeply into customizing ST2, but is it actually feasible to hook into it so deeply?<p>[ETA: There's a stab at an ST org-mode here that I tried previously, but really isn't very far along and development stopped almost a year ago: <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/theblacklion/sublime_orgmode/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/theblacklion/sublime_orgmode/</a> There's a fork at

Maybe surprisingly, we find that these families---though they requires a large buffer of random numbers---are often faster than popular hash functions with weaker theoretical guarantees. Moreover, conventional wisdom is that hash functions with fewer multiplications are faster. Yet we find that they may fail to be faster due to operation pipelining. We present experimental results on several processors including low-powered processors. Our tests include hash functions designed for processors with the Carry-Less Multiplication (CLMUL) instruction set. We also prove, using accessible proofs, the strong universality of our families.""""""",1329991676

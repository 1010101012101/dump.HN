3928974,comment,3927891,3928878,1,0,jbooth,,,"Not really, typically you'd have one thread handling all sendFiles through a single selector over the destination sockets.  As a matter of fact, it's actually really painful to do sendFile in Java from a single thread, because when the channel isn't ready for sending, rather than returning EAGAIN and letting you busy-loop or wait/retry or whatever, it throws an exception.  So you have to use a selector to do sendfile, and in that case, why not use multiple tasks with the same selector?",1336147172

3928895,comment,3926938,3928790,1,0,nirvana,,,"1. This has not been my experience. I've sent my resume to these kinds of companies ""non tech"" companies, at various periods and have had no trouble getting gigs with them (I was consulting at the time.)<p>2. This is pure prejudice. It may be true for many people, but it is not universally true.  Some people go to college having no idea what they want to be.  That was me and I studied physics but it quickly became clear that software was what I cared about (originally I thought it had been electronics.)  It wasn't the exposure to physics that made it clear I wanted to do software.  Plus the terrible ""exposure"" of college to Economics, Sociology, Philosophy, and History turned me off of those subjects for a few years... then later, I started reading up on them, and have become more proficient in 2 of them on my own than I would have been if I'd majored in them in college.   College doesn't make you more well rounded. You can sleep thru all those classes. Its not like you can't order all the literature you want from amazon.com, or see great paintings at museums or on the internet.  What it does is force you to spend time on things that are outside your subject area-- and that would be valuable if college delivered anything useful about them, but it doesn't.  Those classes are a full employment program for liberal arts graduates.<p>3. I think you're speaking from a lack of experience here- because if you'd ever started and grown a business, you'd know it has an impact on many aspects of your life.  For instance, my deep love of history and economics were as a result of starting and growing a tech business. Economics is important to business, for obvious reasons, history less so.  Further, your response shows a form of anti-intellectualism that is the real crime of colleges.  They actually teach people not to think, in a way, but to believe.  The anti-business perspective is a real shame, because its actually anti-life. (It was my study of philosophy that helped me understand that.)<p>4. A degree shows nothing, and is not required.  You only think a degree is required for advancement because you've not been working in the real world.  What determines advancement is performance usually, though often politics and the external state of the company with regards to your area of it (Eg: having a good year or not.)  Nobody remembers you don't have a degree.<p>5. Starting a business is better than being an employee of a little startup, which is better than going to college.  But yes, you can do either while going to college, though you're trading off the amount of education you'll get in favor of spending time at college.<p>6. People who need their life experiences broadened by college aren't really going to get it in college.  Oh, wait, you're talking about partying, right?   At any rate, I think you've got a false dichotomy going here.  Whether you are broad minded and well rounded is determined whether you are curious about things and follow up on that curiosity, not being forced to sit thru some really low level ""education"" in subjects you're not interested in.  It comes from pursuing your interests without regard for which subject matter they lead you to.",1336146391

There are good unionized workers.<p>I'll give you an example:  Las Vegas Convention Center.  Doing some work at night setting up computers, etc.  The crew that installs the carpets comes in.  Their job is, quite literally, to roll out the carpeting.  I watched as this unfolded.  Every hour or so a supervisor would roll around on a little electric cart and would tell people that they had to take a break.  The workers would lay down on the carpet and go to sleep.  This ballet continued for hours.  The work that could have been done in three hours too six, if not more.  I asked one of them how much they made.  She, very proudly replied:  $45 per hour plus benefits and a pension plan.  My jaw dropped.<p>Then there are the stories of the security guards making $150K a year to sit on a chair by a door.  And the stories of the union worker refusing to lend a hand because the task is not in their union contract.<p>Anyhow, the issue, as I see it, is that unions have resulted in hordes of people that are devoid of any real drive to succeed and move forward in life.  In unions there are few incentives to be better at what you do.  In a lot of union contracts you just can't be fired.  I mean, take the examples of (unionized) teachers sexually assaulting students.  They don't get fired, they are transfered and ""hidden"" in another job.  There was a recent case of a (unionized) teacher who was feeding his students cookies with semen on on top.  That's beyond sick. And, as I understand it, the guy was not fired and will enjoy his 80% pension for the rest of his life.<p>Anyhow, I don't want to go off on that tangent, but I've just seen too many examples where unions are just destroying drive, innovation and competitiveness in this country.

Fact is, at most companies outside of the HN-SV-tech startup world, a degree shows that you're competent, and you're facing an uphill battle without one.<p>2. College exposes you to subjects that you normally wouldn't be exposed to. Being an engineer is a respectable profession, but if you've never actually tried other subjects, how could you know if it's the right career for you?

Sure, you could just go to the library, but quite frankly, most people <i>don't know what they don't know</i>.

Specifically, I've hired people with professional-level jobs--the kind you usually ""need"" a degree for--with little regard for whether or not they have a degree. Sometimes I've hired (or promoted or given a raise to, or, for that matter, laid off) the person with a degree. Sometimes I've hired/promoted/fired the one without a degree.<p>But here's what I've seen:<p>If you're _very_ successful, it doesn't matter at all. But you need a truly remarkable accomplishment to reach that state. Otherwise it _will_ hurt you, at least with _some_ people, at least _some_ of the time.<p>In particular, it will hurt you with:<p>- HR departments when they are deciding whether or not you meet the base requirements of the position, or what pay you should receive.<p>- You direct managers as they fight with HR about things like requirements and pay (or if they choose to fight for these things) at both hiring-time and promotion or annual-review time.<p>- Supervisors and middle/upper management as they consider which employees are likely retention/flight risks, and which are not. (and therefore which are likely to get perks as an incentive for staying and which are not-likely to get those perks, because they at least a little more ""trapped"" in their position).<p>I have seen all three of these things happen more than once.  I've seen really good and smart and (largely) productive people get shafted over the long haul: not because of any one major decision that didn't go their way but because of a series of little ones over a period of years--decisions where they were disadvantaged, however slightly, but not having a degree.  These issues come up for at least the first 15-20 years of one's career, in my experience.<p>Having a degree, if nothing else, demonstrates a certain amount of ""stick-to-it-iveness"".  I'd guess that most people forced to make a a hiring or investment decision would at least pause to consider why candidate dwong didn't complete a degree program.<p>Unless (a) the thing you dropped out to do is pretty obvious and (b) in retrospect that was pretty obviously a smart decision,or (c) you've done something in the interim that overwhelms these other questions then many people when faced with hiring/investment decisions are going to at least pause and consider whether you have sufficient drive/commitment/ability to overcome obstacles over the long haul.<p>You may be more or less likely to run into people that care about the degree in some fields, but you'll run into a least some of them in every field.  You may be able to accomplish something remarkable enough that no one cares about the degree question at all, but ""I founded this web-based start-up. We did OK."" isn't remarkable enough. You may be able to build a career for yourself (as an employee or an entrepreneur) where the opinions of the people that care don't matter, but bear in mind that until you reach of point of literally independent wealth everyone has a ""customer"" of some kind that they'll need to keep happy--a boss, an investor, a board, a patron, a client, etc.<p>I'd think really hard about whether the thing you are dropping out of a degree program for is truly worth it.  It's not the end of the world. It doesn't even really close any doors for you. But it does make some doors a littler harder to open (and some a lot harder to open). Is doing your alternative to college right now and possibly limiting your options for the next 10-20 years worth more to you than delaying your alternative for a year or two and finishing school first?  That's not a rhetorical question--I honestly don't know what the answer is for you. But I don't believe the people who say it simply doesn't matter at all. There really are some negative repercussions of that decision (just as there are negative repercussions to the decision to stay in school as well). You just need to figure out if the good outweighs the bad.<p>I'd also think really hard about whether ""dropping out"" and ""not dropping out"" are the only two options.  Can you take a sabbatical/leave-of-absence/year-off/semester-abroad?  Can you moonlight on whatever you'd otherwise be doing? Can you do school part-time? Switch to a different school?  Switch programs?  Find a program more in line with you passions?  Go all-in and finish school faster?<p>(There is also value in the college experience and liberal arts education, but I'll leave that argument for another day.)<p>As practical matter, it really is _generally_ a bad idea to simply drop out entirely.  If you were my friend or my kid, I'd strongly encourage you to demonstrate problem solving skills and find a way--however non-traditional that way might be--to make it work instead.",1336144754

I liked the movie for a whole set of reasons (For instance, Christopher Walken's performance) but reading the book would  definitely have affected how I value the director's work. I had a similar discussion with my uncle, who is a writer and director, about another movie: The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo (The original version, not the American adaptation). My uncle read the books; I didn't. I really liked the movie, and found the plot rather satisfying to some degree, but my uncle hated it, and said the director simplified things to an alarming extent, losing all the interesting details that made the books successful. 
So I think reading the books is a good habit if one wants to judge the director's intention, but sometimes I just don't have time.<p>Update: I reread your question, and I think you want to know if directors are taking too much credit which ought to go to the book writer?

I've been frustrated about this ""feature"" for a long time. However, after reading all posts about the issue and realising that there is no fix I made a last desperate attempt. I went into folder settings and checked the ""single click"" option(while having both ""show all folders"" and ""automatically expand"" checked), just to see if this option was better. It wasn't so I unchecked it again. Then, after this manouver, Explorer lists folders correctly, always starting at the top. Just to make sure this fix wasn't transient I closed the Explorer and restarted it. It still works. I have no idea why this works but it does. Writing software myself I do have a clue that the sequence in which checkboxes are checked can have impact on software behaviour. It might also explain why some people experience this issue while others don't.<p>Hope this works for all you frustrated people out there.

11028728,comment,11027556,11027556,0,0,newscracker,,,"It is saddening to see names like Yahoo going through so much trouble, but there seems to be an inevitability here that many knew about for a long time.<p>Yahoo, after Marissa Mayer took over, also seems to have focused more on revenue from graphical ads compared to getting any revenue directly from users.<p>* Although mail may be a good product for Yahoo (as this article states), it&#x27;s not really improved over time and has in fact gotten worse.<p>* The previous Yahoo Mail Plus, which was $20 a year for an ad-free experience with some extras (like POP email) was replaced with a who-would-even-want-this $50 a year ad-free option. Frankly, I doubt if many people even bothered to get this one, more so because among the people who started email with the likes of Hotmail and Yahoo, multiple email addresses were the norm (they continue to be so). For such users who stuck with Yahoo, there&#x27;s no way to justify spending more than a hundred dollars a year for email.<p>* With no sign of IMAP in the paid option while Google has been giving free IMAP for years, Yahoo&#x27;s offering in email was really substandard.<p>* Yahoo mail is still quite slow. Not the interface, but the backend. Sending a mail to oneself (by a CC when replying or emailing someone) still takes several minutes to show up in the inbox. In Gmail, this would be in the inbox in a second or two.<p>* Yahoo mail&#x27;s spam filtering is many a times as bad as a coin toss. Emails that you mark as Not Spam for specific senders continue to go to the spam folder for subsequent mails from the same sender. Many emails that are true spam and have been marked as such don&#x27;t seem to put similar mails in the spam folder.<p>* The vertical graphical ads on the right side, in an attempt to avoid ads from going off screen while scrolling through emails, are really annoying.<p>* Flickr, providing an astonishing 1TB of storage for &quot;free&quot; (with ads). The next paid option is $50 a year just to remove ads (double of what Flickr Pro used to cost). What???<p>* Any value assigned to user experience before was completely eliminated through these &quot;more ads&quot; move, where Yahoo was sure that almost nobody would opt for the paid options.<p>I wonder what would&#x27;ve happened if Yahoo had instead lowered the prices even more for an ad-free option, added some useful features (like IMAP in email) in a tiered pricing structure and made the product better (like handling email delivery quickly). Perhaps it&#x27;s too late to wonder about these though. If Yahoo isn&#x27;t bought by one of the top five tech companies, its products will likely disappear within the next decade.",1454525996

Also, in the 2008 recession, people without 4-year degrees were hurt far worse and recovered slower than those with degrees.<p>Lie 2 is reasonable, except in particular majors. My wife was a historic preservation major in undergrad (I think there&#x27;s less than a dozen in the country, and one happened to be in-state but she would have gone out of state if necessary) and her graduate program was out-of-state for Museum Studies. There are only a handful of these programs in the country, so being out-of-state was not a choice.<p>3 is also incorrect in my experience.

Pretty much anyone can get a loan for any amount, depending on what school they&#x27;re going to. I for one borrowed about $26,000 to go to a local technical college, and that included about 2 semesters of classes in a major I ended up dropping. I was never once questioned about how much was borrowed, or asked to demonstrate any knowledge, just sign on this line and you get free money. How many 19 year olds wouldn&#x27;t jump at that? I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s right, I&#x27;m pointing out the fact that if I were going to a bank to buy a house or a car, they would demand a LOT more (proof of income, talk me through the terms, interest, etc.) than a school does.<p>2) It&#x27;s basically required. At this point a high school diploma isn&#x27;t getting you shit if you aren&#x27;t some startup funded golden child. Someone going out into the market for white collar work pretty much MUST have at least a 2 year degree, and most businesses prefer 4 year degrees. It seems wrong to me that we&#x27;re billing people for what is more or less an essential part of their resume if they want to do something other than trade skills and that sort of thing, and doubling down on that, it seems insane than the debt incurred is not dischargeable in bankruptcy and can be payed back via seizure of tax refunds and other assets.<p>3) Entrance counseling is a joke. Yeah I know how loans work, I get this money now, I pay it back later. That does not cover nearly enough, and not to mention you can breeze through it in about a half an hour and fail the tests as many times as you want, as long as you check all the right boxes you can get past it, get your loan and never think about any of that shit again.<p>I&#x27;m not in trouble personally, I make my payments and I&#x27;m up to date. It just drives me crazy when boomers are out there saying &quot;we started out with nothing&quot; and my reply to that is &quot;I started 25k in the hole, I would&#x27;ve LOVED to have started with nothing.&quot;",1454525187

Diodes have a voltage drop across them, usually 0.6V for standard and 0.4V for Schottky types.  Using one of these to protect one rail means you&#x27;ll have about 1W lost to heat when charging at 3A.   They are also not small for the currents involved with high-speed charging, being about 7x6x2.5mm for the smallest ones I can find that can handle 3A.<p>Devices don&#x27;t usually have too much in the lines of over current protection outside of something like a polyfuse because the device will dictate the current used; if everything is okay in the device it&#x27;ll set the charging rate and it only needs the most basic of protections in the case that something goes grossly wrong with the device.

You have a loan that may take many years to repay, but unlike a mortgage there is no house to repossess if the loan goes bad.  You can&#x27;t repo a degree.<p>A good exercise is to imagine that you&#x27;re a lender writing checks with your own money.  Would you even make loans to somebody majoring outside of STEM?  What interest would you charge especially given other options for investing your capital?

A node receiving dynamically sized data then has the problem of knowing how much data to allocate for the full message, plus the receiver has to inspect the data as it comes in to see where it ends. With an ION message the receiver knows within the first 4-5 bytes (typically) how big that message will be, and can thus copy the following bytes directly into the perfectly allocated memory area, without having to examine them any further.

So if I make a bogus claim that your work infringes on something I actually have copyright over (however tenuous), it doesn&#x27;t trigger the actual perjury bit.  But if I claim to own, say, a Beatles album (which I do not) , or to be their copyright agent (which I am not), then it&#x27;s a violation.<p>[EDIT: Just to clarify the above, this is to mean that I claim someone infringe on a Beatles album which I don&#x27;t own or that I&#x27;m their agent when I am not.  Thus, it&#x27;s when my claim of ownership over the allegedly infringed upon work is a lie that this triggers, rather than any dispute over the ownership of the allegedly infringing work.]<p>I think that (unless barred somehow in YouTube&#x27;s ToS), that a large enough group might be able to sue the groups making false claims for their ad money.<p>It&#x27;s rather murky whether you could go after people who are, e.g., claiming copyright over public domain works, but with sufficient evidence of bad faith, maybe you could get somewhere.<p>The main problem is that federal lawsuits are really expensive and the amounts of money here are usually not all that large.  It&#x27;s not clear to me whether there are damages in an amount sufficient to make a class action worthwhile or anyone with deep enough pockets to pay a judgement even if one were obtained at great expense.<p>Or maybe someone could do a class action against YouTube as a whole for upholding bogus claims, but I&#x27;m not sure that you don&#x27;t agree not to hold YouTube liable somewhere in some ToS and even if you do, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s enforceable.<p>Disclaimer:  IANAL, this isn&#x27;t legal advice.

The address of the cmp has to be at least checked to determine if it faults, so I would think at least some part of it would have to be serialized after the first branch, making it slower than the version without the type guard.",1454523755

If you have a college degree you are supposed to be able to get a good job. I think the main problem with that advice is that it was good advice when a college degree was relatively rare. These days, everyone is expected to get a college degree so the degree itself becomes worthless. Instead students should focus on acquiring some kind of skill in their post-secondary education. For example, a history degree doesn&#x27;t actually give you any useful skills while a computer science degree gives you skill in writing software which is a high-demand job right now. Actually, many students who get a college degree would be better off going to a vocational school to learn welding or some other skill.

It seemed like we were locked into a 6.5% rate no matter what, but others were getting loans at nearly half that rate. I&#x27;m not sure if this was based on need (seems like a dumb way to set interest rates), when we first started taking the loans, or what.<p>Once you graduate, you&#x27;re able to refinance into a private loan, which will get you a lower rate, but you seem pretty stuck while in school and unsubsidized loans accrue interest while you&#x27;re in school. Our loans will be paid off in a few short months, but we have been scrimping by the past two years in order to put as much money as possible towards the loans. I&#x27;d guess most people don&#x27;t graduate as undergrads to this type of scenario. With law school, you&#x27;re hopefully graduating into a nice paying position and are in a better financial place to pay off the loans. I do find it a bit ridiculous that during a period when you could finance a house at 3%, a car at 2%, and could only get 0.5% or 1% on a savings account that the government was collected 6.5% of student loans. Yet, they did, and lots of students are going to be stuck paying multiples of their actual education cost as they pay interest on those loans for 30 years.<p>There is a government program where if you work in the public sector for 10 years, they will forgive your law school loans. I did the math on this and it ended up costing less money to just pay off the loans as quickly as possible rather than pay 10 years worth of interest on them, while being indentured to a single public-service job that likely pays less than the private sector anyway.",1454523591

Adobe&#x27;s algorithm models the whitespace between two letters as a viscous fluid which resists flowing into tight areas. They compared it to hand-kerning and found that neither approach was perfect, but that there were 120% more deficiencies when kerning by hand and 30% redundancy in the kerning pairs. So computers, can and do kern better than humans.

But (admittedly, anecdotally) everyone I talk to seems to use Dropbox. Personally, I use it on all of my devices.<p>I also use Box for business-related storage, and Google Drive for presentations, documents, etc. I use Amazon Prime Photos to store my photo roll. I don&#x27;t think that any of those detract from Dropbox&#x27;s primary use case of sharing files between different machines. I don&#x27;t think people think of Dropbox as &quot;cloud storage,&quot; but instead as a way to move files back and forth and have constant availability on machines they use.<p><i>> Our company actually banned Dropbox.com</i><p>I work in information security, and although I haven&#x27;t banned Dropbox from a network layer, I can certainly relate to the sentiment. You have to remember that it&#x27;s not just corporate use that caused the Dropbox ban -- your sysadmins also don&#x27;t want people putting work documents in Dropbox to work on from home, because <i>so many</i> people already use Dropbox in their personal lives. The fact that your organization blocked Dropbox, instead of just saying &quot;we use Google Drive,&quot; speaks to the fact that so many people are already happy Dropbox users and would just as soon continue to use it.<p>That said, I agree with you wholeheartedly that Dropbox, if going for major corporate adoption, will fail in its endeavor. I don&#x27;t think that Google Drive is the primary competitor -- in my opinion, it&#x27;s Box. Yes, you have to actually pay for Box, but in many corporate environments, that&#x27;s not really much of an issue.<p>Said another way, I predict Dropbox failing in a corporate environment for the same reason they will continue to succeed with personal users: businesses want &quot;cloud storage,&quot; and personal users want &quot;easy file share with myself.&quot;<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll look back on this comment in a few years and see that I was dead wrong, but for now that&#x27;s where I&#x27;d put my money.",1454522904

Chromium believed the sandboxing should happen at the <i>browser</i> level, with WebKit communicating to the trusted chrome process via the &quot;WebKit port&quot; named &quot;chromium&quot;, which is basically just a set of IPC hooks that expect to be talking to Chromium on the other side. WebKit2 was designed to bring both the trusted and untrusted parts of the project under the WebKit umbrella, and as a result it had tighter integration.<p>The Blink fork has made this less of an issue, since now chrome and content code are under single repositories (Chromium and WebKit) in both projects. However, you still see evidence of this all over the place. For example, Blink&#x27;s content code largely follows WebKit coding style as opposed to the chrome code which follows Google&#x27;s corporate style, while WebKit&#x27;s coding style is unified for both chrome and content.",1454522407

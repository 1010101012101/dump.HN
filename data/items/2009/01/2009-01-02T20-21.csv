Many advances made over the years were due to such increases in computing power.  Take for example: the mouse, the windowing UI, desktop search, and spatial navigation (this one hasn't really happened yet).  Each item on that list required more power than was available to the previous OS iteration.  Are you suggesting that this progression has stopped and our ""WIMP"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)</a>) paradigm is the ultimate interaction with our computer?<p>I'm not saying that Windows 7 is leaps and bounds better than XP, but essentially that's the argument you are making.

This, while resulting in tabloid sensationalism, also means that government scandals are highlighted and often magnified which help keep them in check. 
As far as choosing a direction goes, anti-incumbency always triumphs because the disgruntled are always in sizable numbers. That, however, does not affect corporate policies much more that changing the governmental cogs that need to be greased.
In a nutshell, this is India's formula for growth: A patchwork democracy that moves slowly and clumsily, and sustainable corruption that allows enough breathing space for far more nimble corporate entities.
This reminds me of what is said of Italy: the economy grows at night while the government sleeps.",1230929637

I have no doubt that you can <i>describe</i> short term stock market fluctuations in many different ways (fractals and multi-fractals being one of them) that still doesn't get you anywhere close to <i>explaining or predicting</i> those fluctuations. There is good reason for this, of course. Mainly, that short term behavior is mostly psychological. If investors are happy (confident, bull, whatever you want to call it) prices go up, if they are unhappy (scared, bearish, etc) prices go down. To this short time scale behavior you have to add the long time scale component that makes the average market value increase at roughly 10% a year, and the ""invisible hand"" effect that makes individual stock prices converge (eventually) to the correct value.<p>IMHO, It's the combination of these three effects that make (short term) stock market fluctuations practically unpredictable.<p>Here's an hilarious description of this ""market sentiment""...<p><pre><code>      “You have to remember two things about the markets.
      One is that they are made up of very sharp and 
      sophisticated people, these are the greatest brains. 
      And the second thing you have to remember, is that 
      the financial markets, to use the common phrase, are 
      driven by sentiment.

      What does that mean?

      What does that mean? Well, things, lets say, are just
      going along as normal in the market. And then, 
      suddenly, out ot the blue, one of these very sharp 
      and sophisticated people says “MY GOD, SOMETHING 
      AWFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN! WE LOST EVERYTHING! OH MY 
      GOD, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO 
      DO?!? SHALL I JUMP OUT OF THE WINDOW? LET’S ALL JUMP 
      OUT OF THE WINDOW! SELL, SELL, SELL! Precisely. And 
      then, a few days later, this same, sophisticated 
      person says ‘you know, I think things are going 
      rather well’ and everybody else says ‘I agree with 
      you, I think we’re rich.’ [...] And that’s what we 
      call market sentiment.”

However, there are many public school systems in the USA that are successful. Why? That is the right question to ask.<p>The education problem is much more complicated than simply giving parents and students the choice of school to attend.

417663,comment,417463,417463,0,0,mitko,,,"As Mandelbrot stated :<p>These techniques do not come closer to forecasting a price drop or rise on a specific day on the basis of past records. But they provide estimates of the probability of what the market might do and allow one to prepare for inevitable sea changes.<p>In my opinion multifractals can explain the Dow and Nasdaq fluctuations, but it is not enough to predict them. That the market has fractal structure as Mandelbrot noticed is probably very good assumption, but it depends on so many factors that the dimentionality of the fractal will be enormous, and one of the dimencions would be time. Also every stock history, every index, or whatever other value used is just a function of that fractal structure with respect to current and past time. Knowing the values of these functions can give a lot information about the structure of the market to estimate what would be their future values but this is not sure to happen. However some trends could be estimated but their time scale cannot be known for sure ( we have multifractal in which the time can be streched ).  So we can say we expect that there will be crisis between 3 and 6 months from now on but we may never the exact that until it hits us.<p>Very similar is the situation with earthquake predictions, but there we have I believe much more knowledge about the underlying fractal structure (the Earth, continents, continental drift, internal Earth energy etc.) We can say there would be big earthquake in Cali every several decades but short term predictions are hard to make.<p>I will be happy to hear your opinion about fractals and stock market.",1230928666
417662,comment,417542,417542,0,0,mdasen,,,"The problem with his argument is that it rests on the American economy having a realistic chance of collapse that at least equals if not exceeds that of the Great Depression.  ""With 20 or 30 percent of Americans facing a realistic probability of losing their jobs"" - I don't think that's realistic.  We've seen worse unemployment rates in my state within the past decade.  We haven't even hit the problems of the early 80s.  So, it's premature to assume that we're going to see a massive collapse that sees unemployment at 25-35% as he suggests.<p>In terms of government spending, there are some areas that we should scale back, but government spending doesn't hurt economic growth <i>unless</i> it's simply spending for consumption.  If it's spending for investment (such as improvements in infrastructure, education of future generations, etc.) it doesn't harm economic growth.  The few trillion we're spending overseas in military jaunts will hopefully get a huge cut in the next administration.<p>Pensions need a complete overhaul.  The problem is that people want pensions that are written as ""you get x% of your final salary each year for the rest of your life plus health insurance"".  That's a nebulous liability.  If you want to pay an insurance company to take on that liability, you can't afford it and governments are the only ones that won't go bankrupt paying it (since they'll just push the burden onto future generations).  Towns and cities are getting hit by this bad.  It is my belief that the government <i>should</i> provide for you as long as you live - BUT the government should be providing for you at a <i>very</i> low rate.  Any luxuries you want are your problem.  If you want to be able to pass your house to your kids, you better have saved up to cover your retirement or you can reverse mortgage the house and when you pass, the house goes to the bank.  I <i>do</i> believe that government must provide for its citizens.  It should <i>not</i> provide a middle-class lifestyle.  It can't.  It's definitionally impossible to provide everyone with a middle-class lifestyle or better.<p>Likewise, health must be re-understood.  First, we love new things in America more than anywhere and as such we demand new (even if it isn't better).  For example, there is no evidence that Nexium is better than Prilosec (both made by AstraZenica and Nexium being an isomer of Prilosec), but Nexium is newer and under patent and Rx and costing many times more.  And so many people go for it because the cost is likely to be the same to them (via insurance).  People aren't price-sensitive in medicine.  I don't want people depriving themselves of treatment, but Rx allergy medicine is often near identical to what you can get OTC today.  However, many go for the Rx because it's just as cheap (for them).  It's wasteful!  Incredibly!  Similarly, new treatments are expensive and then come down in price (much the same way computer technology works).  Blu-Ray players cost $1,000 a couple years ago.  Now you can find them for under $300.  The problem is that we won't tell someone, ""sorry, that treatment is really new and we just won't cover it until it gets cheaper"".  The questions is: how do we enable people to get the latest treatments as soon as possible without causing costs to be enormous?  And there might be trade-offs that no one wants to make.  We also need to become a more fit society.  No matter how much efficiency we put into our healthcare system, we will pay a lot more than anyone else because we are a really unhealthy people.  We need to change that.  Now!  I hate suggesting that a monetary incentive be in there, but that's what does it for people.  No environmental or congestion plea could stop SUVs, but $4 gasoline did in a couple months.  If you tried to sell one, you were getting nothing for it.  Part of the issue here is what health problems are a person's fault and what aren't?  We like to think of weight as a person's problem.  Smoking definitely is and it's time smokers paid more in group insurance policies.  Weight is hard.  You definitely have some control over it, but then again, you have some control over cancer as well (from sun block to eating well and having regular screenings).  I don't want to propose anything because I think it's all crap, but we need to loose the weight or stop complaining that health care costs too much.<p>As he mentioned, liability reform is important.  Every time you buy anything - from an x-ray at the hospital to a DVD at Target - you're paying for liability insurance on top of the product's price.  Insurance is expensive because, while one can mostly calculate out things with fun actuaries, you need to keep quite the pad in case you're under with your calculations.<p>I'd disagree that we don't want to increase spending - at least temporarily.  What keeps a market economy going is stability.  With instability, we hoard.  In the short term, we need people to feel like there is stability so that they act normally.  If that involves the government putting some money out there, so be it.  A lot of the suggestions are great in the long-run, but I think the next 12-18 months are important too.<p>I'm not as anti-union as he comes off, but to an extent unions are biting the hand that feeds them.  No, not the companies they work for.  Rather, the market force that drives up wages: automation.  Workers can only be compensated (at maximum) at their rate of production minus costs (like hiring and administration).  If the production of the average worker in a union doesn't go up, neither can wages or benefits.  In fact, benefits might slip if the cost of such benefits outpaces inflation.  Right now, we're seeing a very anti-automation union stance.  Europe and Asia are starting to use more capital per worker than the United States.  Americans are great workers, but you just can't compete en-masse if you put yourself at such a huge capital disadvantage.  I like unions EXCEPT for their anti-automation stance.  Restricting capital kills businesses.<p>In terms of education, I think we need more informal education.  How much have we all learned on this site?  Wikipedia?  We're seeing the opportunity to really get knowledge out there and to interact more efficiently.  Heck, those online chat things that businesses employ for support are a great source of inspiration.  They allow one employ to deal with several customers at once.  And unlike a classroom, you don't have the issue of interrupting a lecture to ask.  And that knowledge could be gone over and made into an FAQ-like structure for a topic.<p>In terms of labor markets, we're plenty deregulated.  American businesses already see incredible freedom here.  Minimum wages are very, very low.  I'm not someone that goes around saying that the poverty line is set 3x too low (that it should be 30k for a single person rather than 10k), but I'd really rather not see wages fall at the lowest end.  I'm a single person living in walking distance of the T (subway) in Cambridge and live off $15k per year for everything (except this year which saw a shiny new MacBook Pro).  I'm not depriving myself of anything I want, but I don't just spend to spend.  I don't regularly eat out, buy drinks at bars, spend lots on random expensive things, whatnot.  Still, people need a certain level.<p>Similarly, I think affirmative action is in my best interest in the long-run.  It's annoying as hell.  Heck, even most African-Americans surveyed are against it.  However, underclasses are bad for a society.  Underclasses cause friction and havoc that take money from me.  People who think a system is stacked against them try to go around it.  PG commented a few days ago saying, ""Markets interpret social engineering as damage and route around it.""  If there is one thing I want, it's that people work inside the system.  Plus, it's inherently unfair that some people are the decedents of historically discriminated people and, well, I am as well, but they're people that are seen in a good light in modern America which gives me an advantage.  But beyond the unfairness, giving people stuff gives them things to loose.  That's good for me because the more you have to loose the less chance you're going to do something stupid to me.<p>I really want to applaud Dr Greenspun for offering his knowledge to others freely.  It's wonderful.",1230928650

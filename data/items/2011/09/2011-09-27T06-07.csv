I mean no disrespect to anyone who works in the scene - not to employees, not to founders, and not even to many investors.  I used to be part of it myself.  But what the hell is going on? People are trying to find out how many ways they can push around bits of information.  They get an investment, iterate like crazy, and strive to get acquired, only to have their product completely destroyed by their new parent company.<p>Out of all the startups EVER created, I have only used a few products with more than passing interest: Facebook, Google, Youtube, Stack Overflow, and Yelp.  And I consider myself to be pretty geeky.  Having at least a crude understanding of economic concepts like supply and demand, the startup economy boggles my mind.  How is it that so much money is getting circulated around hundreds of thousands of startups when only a handful of them survive for more than 3 years? (And yes, I often count acquisitions as ""certain death."") Consumer goods have immediate and often necessary value.  Houses last a long time, and carry obvious value.  But tech companies can fizzle into nothingness in seconds.  These days, value is measured in the size of your user base, which is kind of like monetizing a cat based on how many people pet it.  Startups are getting so cheap to produce, I feel like we might as well be trading ideas.<p>All I can say is thank god for the sham.  It is keeping me employed. :)<p><i>END INCOHERENT MIDNIGHT RANT</i>",1317106393

3042161,comment,3041873,3042111,3,0,hboon,,,"Protocols are ""interfaces"" (in the general sense of the word in programming). So they are useful when you want to write a delegate (or callbacks in the general sense of the word) class. Many classes have a delegate property that is of type id<SomeProtocol>. Equivalent to Java's interfaces, but Cocoa use protocols heavily for delegates only.<p>Categories are useful not for sharing code, but for expanding a class's functionality. This is especially useful when you write a class X that works with an existing class Y, but some of X's code should be an instance method of Y, or X introduces additional capability for Y to support X. UITableView adding functionality to NSIndexPath to support referencing table sections and rows is a good example. All those Java classes that add static methods to support existing Java classes, or if you used Smalltalk and added methods to existing classes, this is the equivalent.",1317105989

Trusts are also better for survivorship/transfer, and provide some limited liability or asset protection.

It is very difficult to support all the different browsers across desktop and mobile well and still have fast audio and even just simple 2D graphics.   That's <i>today</i>.. in 2007 (when Zynga was started) HTML5 basically didn't exist as anything other than a pipe dream.  If Zynga had ""bet on HTML5"" back in 2007 they would have been a stillborn company that never made any profit to begin with.  For the types of games they make, Flash was inarguably the only option then and even today on desktop browsers it is arguably still the only reasonable option.<p>Yes, HTML5 will be great for games, maybe in 2014 or so.  I'm sure they have people there working with HTML5 and getting ready for that.",1317104527

3042113,comment,3041386,3042045,1,0,zealoushacker,,,"First of all, thank you for staying on point and keeping your rational train of thought. You have been the only one to realize the purpose of my post: stirring rational discussion about a very difficult issue that deserves attention from entrepreneurs. Also, thank you for calling me out on the Socratic run-around and lack of direct statements. Here are my counter-arguments (and notes of agreement, where possible), one by one.<p>> I explained, there are more drivers than 'success' in the real world, that are not simulated by grades.<p>Of course. Everyone has a set of values that they follow through virtuous action or otherwise, whether they realize it or not. Some seek the values that ultimately lead them to their demise, others to their success. This does not, however, preclude  that some values are good and others bad for a given individual. So if achieving good grades were the standard of value in a school system, then it follows that the driver of success in that context were the grades. Yes, in the real world, there are other factors (and if grades were analogous to currency, then the acquisition of wealth is not the only thing I'd be after - and I'd certainly not be accumulating in fiat currency).<p>> The example in the OP illustrates a 'crash' of a socialist system, by saying everyone gets Fs, if you convert that into money, you are talking about a complete crash of equity (i.e there is no money to share around). Meaning there is no welfare, meaning they all starve, with their families. You don't die, if you get a bad grade, you do die, if you don't eat.<p>Of course in a crash of an economic system, wealth allocated \nby individuals in worthless financial instruments (made worthless because their worth had been sanctioned by fiat) would be wiped out. Those individuals whom will have invested in other stores of value  prior to such a crash would prosper, while others would live in squalor or perish (with some room for those in other parts in the middle of the spectrum). Such collapses have happened in the past, and are likely to happen again. Look at what is going in Europe for some early warning signs. There's no true socialism anywhere, but there are very serious attempts at implementing some of the philosophy of socialism. In places where the attempts are the most honest, the crashes shall be the most drastic. The places where they are the most honest, are the places most analogous to the classroom example in the OP piece.<p>> At less extreme cases people will always want to improve their living situation, and thus will strive to generate more capital (or more directly, contributing value to their community).<p>Yes of course in less extreme cases of socialist-like socio-economic systems (as in the US), those who see the writing on the wall will attempt to improve their situation - at any cost - and some without even realizing that they are doing so. I think that many entrepreneurs are in this class.<p>Now as to the reality of the failures of socialism... and its various interpretations... is the analogy of the OP piece I posted clear? Does it make sense, given what I've written above?",1317104427

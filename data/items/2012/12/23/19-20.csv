There's no need for government involvement, except to settle contract disagreement.<p>In fact, it's quite the opposite! Closed shops are illegal in the US, under Taft-Hartley Act, though they are legal in some other countries. Union shops are legal, except where the states have prohibited that practice.<p>The question to the audience is, shouldn't a free market advocate want to reduce both the laws which give unions specific power AND those which take power away from unions?<p>If your concern is about monopoly powers, well, 1) that's a restriction of free trade, so our hypothetical free market advocate might not want those restrictions either, and 2) why aren't they regulated under anti-monopoly laws, rather than specific anti-union laws?<p>As to the net neutrality issue, well, that's a mixture of morality and an abuse of monopoly power. I believe you're only focusing on the latter issue for now. (And I think our government is and has been entirely too closely intertwined with business, and especially big business, for too long, which has allowed these abuses to grow.)<p>Is an employer a sort of monopolist? I believe they are. While there are exceptions (IT in the Bay Area during the dot-com era being an obvious one), for many people it is not easy to quit and easily find new employment. Otherwise Nevada wouldn't have a 10% unemployment rate. The problem with monopolies though isn't that they are monopolies, but that they can abuse their monopoly power.<p>You rightly pointed out that unions can abuse their monopoly power. But so too can companies.<p>So the modified question to the audience is: shouldn't a free market advocate want to reduce both the laws which give unions specific power AND which take power away from unions, so long as there is no abuse of the monopoly power?<p>Unfortunately, the easy answer by an anti-union person is that unions are, by definition, an abuse of monopoly power, so this question has no real utility.

While most people would find laws regulating the information they can share with other people to be unintuitive, people also don't perceive movies, music, and software to be ""information."" The reduction of these things to ""information"" in the sense of ""strings of ones and zeroes"" (no different than say a phone number or someone's birth date) is a distinctly techie abstraction. People perceive these things not as information, but as products, analogizing them to any other product they may buy. Indeed, I think that's where the intuitive appeal of the first sale doctrine comes from.

It would be silly for the implementation to treat just once instance of a behaviour so seriously. If the user buys it once, but then never shows any interest in such products again, then they should slowly be ranked less and less relevant. If the user instead continued to purchase or look at baby items, then the system could have more certainty of desire in them.

4960392,comment,4959619,4959619,3,0,lambda,,,"Hmm. I'm not so sure about his analogy with writing. Of course, most people who take creative writing don't go on to become great writers; that pretty much goes without saying, most people in any field don't go on to become ""great"" (the very definition of ""great"" is that it's exceptional). So that part is a tautology.<p>Now, I wonder about how many people who go on to be ""great writers"" received training in writing? Of course, ""creative writing"" as an academic discipline is rather new, but English has been around as a discipline for years. From a quick poll of the authors mentioned in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century_in_literature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century_in_literature</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century_in_literature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century_in_literature</a>, almost every one had at least a college education, mostly in the humanities (which generally require a lot of writing, and train you in writing). And most of them have worked at lower-level writing jobs before becoming great writers; copy editors, journalists, corporate writers, and the like. Several of the more recent ""great writers"" of the late 20th and 21st centuries have indeed gone through creative writing programs.<p>So his analogy, at least, seems to be false.<p>How about in writing software? Well, as I mentioned, it's pretty much tautological that no training program can produce entirely great programmers. The purpose of training is to turn lousy programmers into mediocre. Mediocre into passable. Passable into good. Good into very good. And very good into great. You are not likely to train all of your lousy programmers into great; so claiming that training does not produce great programmers is attacking a strawman.<p>I have seen plenty of people who have gotten a degree in computer science who are lousy programmers. And I have seen great programmers with no formal education. But on the whole, when I've looked at programmers with equivalent amounts of experience, but where one had formal training and the other did not, I would prefer the one who had some formal training. People who have not had formal training tend to not have much experience with reasoning about algorithms, or invariants, that can make their code a lot better.<p>While its true that nowadays we have many libraries and tools that mean that the average programmer can just use built-in data structures and do a pretty good job, I've seen enough code that was so horribly inefficient that even a little bit of algorithmic analysis upfront would have been helpful. Or a lot of code where someone just hacked away at a problem until they had something that worked, rather than trying to formulate a model that would underly it and keep the code well-organized and understandable.<p>And among those programmers who are self-taught but great, they have put in deliberate practice, and deliberate study, even if its on their own.<p>So sure, there are some people who are just untrainable; I've worked with some of them. And there are some people who are naturally brilliant and able to study independently. But all else being equal, I think that deliberate training definitely has value in improving the quality of programmers as a whole; and so yes, training will lead to more great programmers.",1356291998

That's if you're maximally efficient and control your own schedule.<p>* What you mentioned about bureaucrats becoming worse writers is probably true. It takes <i>deliberate practice</i>.

4960346,comment,4959803,4959803,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"Law (which OP focuses on) is a bizarre profession, because it used to be driven by an arms race dynamic. Most of what lawyers do, at the top of the profession, isn't intellectually difficult. The game is about being able to generate work for the other team faster than they can adapt to it. When litigation happens between large corporations, it's about playing the process, not arguing or interpreting the law itself. It devolves into brute-force process playing. It's not what you see in the movies, since cases so rarely go to trial.<p>So, even though the work itself isn't challenging, large law firms have traditionally sought very qualified people, not because of the work, but because there's a complex, ever-evolving game in this war of attrition. The winning team is the one that generates work faster than the other can keep up, and you need to be smart, driven, and brutal enough to work the angles. This also explains the 70-hour weeks that became the norm in biglaw. The game is about beating the other side to death with excess work, so the best hires are people who can do huge amounts of boring, procedural work and not get completely exhausted.<p>What changed is that there's now less work to go around, due to cost-cutting and ""demand destruction"" among these firms' Wall Street clientele. There's no longer 70 hours of work per associate. Now the firms are overstaffed relative to the actual workload. Well, the partners want to keep their lifestyles, so associates get axed. What's most disgusting about it is the recent trend of ""stealthing"", which is disguising a layoff as a performance-based firing.<p>There's also a bimodal income distribution. There's ""biglaw"" which has a hard salary floor of $165k per year, and ""everything else"" where the average might be $50k. Law is one profession where it's not at all uncommon to be making <i>less</i> at 35 (after not making partner, and being <i>lucky</i> if you crack 120k) than at 26.<p>White-shoe law is melting down. So is investment banking, on which it relies, but banking's degradation is more graceful. Banking is just hiring fewer people and reducing bonuses, while law has this problem of large numbers of marginally qualified people who've spent large amounts of money on JD degrees.<p>What have we learned from the Law Crash? (Yes, there was a Law Bubble, and boy has it crashed.) I think the lesson is about how of an influence <i>respectability</i> has over peoples' work lives. The attraction of the legal profession wasn't just the money, but also the prestige. You're not some plumber or computer programmer-- occupations whose average members now seem to be doing better than average attorneys-- you're a <i>lawyer</i>. Even now, with law imploded, I think that impulse is strong. What we're out of touch with is that most upper-middle-class Americans would see it as weird and risky for a young person to go off to Silicon Valley, and upper-class would only approve it if you were a VC, not an entrepreneur.<p>People are desperate for the credibility and respectability of being a ""professional"", but the professions are under attack. Doctors are being pillaged by health-insurance barbarians, the law bubble is collapsing, and academia's a non-concern by this point. Which means that the best (and, for many, only) ways for most people to make a decent living are in formerly ""unrefined"" lines of work. For a lot of people, it's a shock.<p>Millennials, for their part, often feel cheated out of this. They should. They were put through a 16+ year game to lead them to believe they'd have a certain kind of elite life, and then most were dumped into a featureless landfill of confusion and mediocrity.

I could use gmail chat to talk about tiananman square, but as soon as I did all of my Google apps would suddenly be unavailable. I can only assume that when i used certain keywords my every chat was being monitored. A VPN was the only way I could access YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and even some Google searches.<p>But reality is 90% of the young population of Shanghai didn't really care what the ""great firewall"" did, because EVERYONE used a VPN. I saw more people watching YouTube in China than I do in the states, even though Chinese versions of these platforms exist. Some platforms, like RenRen (Facebook-like but more similar to Russia's VKontakte) were popular, but most just used the US-built versions. Now most of them won't be able to.<p>This absolutely terrifies me. I was literally minutes away from being on a bullet train from Shanghai to Beijing that killed ""x"" people. Chinese authorities cite incredibly low numbers for a train traveling at 300 km/h. Most non-state observers cited hundreds of deaths. China slowly grew its number from 20-40.<p>It's illegal for foreigners to talk about the ""Three Ts"" with Chinese nationals - Tibet, Taiwan, and Tiananman Square. But previously the youth learned through their VPNs letting them access the outside world. With that shut down, the government might as well be burning books.",1356290702

And therefore it does not follow that ""the market"" knows how to value starups either. The market works only if <i>someone</i> at least knows what they are doing.

If so, one value the pool X and tha assign X/n<i>(a) to any individual startup, where N is number and (a) is proportionate variable. This is one way to say or reconcile the investment in startups with the statement that investing in any one startup is not an analytically tractable problem.

So when you're done eating you just walk out - no waiting for the check, no computing tips, none of that nonsense that should not be part of a pleasant dinner. It's incredibly liberating, in a way I would never understood if I was only <i>told</i> about it.<p>For another example, when you arrive to the restaurant ""Canlis"" they help you out of the car, and then you walk right into the place. When you're done eating, you walk right out and your car is already back there. They spot you on the way to the door and reshuffle the cars so that yours is at the front. So you just walk out, get in the car and drive off. As it turned out, searching for a place to park, parking, pocketing the keys etc etc is a huge mental overhead. I only realized that when I was liberated from it. The typical ""valet"" service actually does nothing for me - there is still overhead of asking for your car, waiting for it to be brought, tipping the valet. Meh.<p>Both places are charging a pretty penny for their services, so they can afford the ""luxury"" of good service, including good wages to the employees who make it possible. Sadly, neither does both of these things, which is still an open niche in Seattle dining. But more to the point at hand: where the restaurants make good service at cost of quality labor, computer systems could do the same at cost of good engineering, that is remove unnecessary delays and accidental complexity.",1356290250

4960265,comment,4959803,4960148,4,0,001sky,,,"The most ossified countries are the ones with the most expensive real-estate (places like urban italy, japan) where the birth rate collapses because the young cant afford to raise/support urban families. The US is now entereing that phase. The older generations are grandfathered (excuse the pun) into cheaper asset bases (10x incrrease in housing pricing in 40 years, etc) so even if they are not making $$ income they are controlling the much of the critial assets. Gen Yxz etx are just increaing their asset values (through externalities) by being young and hip and beautiful and in the neighborhood. That kind of think.<p>On the other hand, the income streams of the younger generatonis look much more like annuity than perpetuity. Iven if you make nice earning for a couple of years, housing/college debt is predicated on 30-50 years of consistent earnings. The consistency of any person X earnings today is pretty unlikely to persist. Even a successful person can be made obsolete in a 5 yrs timespan (say--company is sold, market changes, etc). This is thus leading to entirely odd outcomes as there is a mis-match of earnings/liabilities for personal balance sheets for teh yound. ie, moving jobs/et vs massive debt it takes to run housefold/pay for future kids school, etc.<p>Its also an equity problem for texes. one or two good years get taxed and two or three lean years later, you lost a bit chunk of earnings to takes. if you had smooth earnings, you would pay lower taxs, etc. whereas the older generation is sitting on tax-free capital gain on housing, so low income/low taxed, yet they are conrolling massive asset value.<p>This system is what killed japan culturally. zero percent interest rates will do that to you. so the future looks bright if you think the lottery style outcome is a good one to play, but on average it is losing bet except for those selling tickets.",1356289477

9301863,comment,9299762,9301370,0,0,whalesalad,,,"I&#x27;d definitely recommend reading up on the Clojure Reader: <a href=""http://clojure.org/reader"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/reader</a><p>There is a big difference between Clojure/Lisp and other languages like Python or PHP. With a traditional language, the code is transformed via a parser into a data structure (typically as an abstract syntax tree) whereas with Clojure the code you are looking at _is_ the data structure of the program. This is why you&#x27;ll oftentimes hear about Lispy languages modifying themselves or writing other programs. This is why writing a DSL in Clojure or Lisp is so natural or straightforward.<p>If you can wrap your head around this distinct difference I think that it will really help with understanding this story as well as a lot of the more fascinating differences with a Lispy languages.<p>For example, the explanation of the &quot;Unknown or Expired Link&quot; HN &quot;bug&quot;: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17705"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17705</a>",1427867951

This is a walk in the part compared to the races in Europe, New Zealand and North America, which have more geologically recent mountain ranges, and communities in which alpine / mountaineering / orienteering and running cross over.<p>I&#x27;ve heard Anton Krupicka (well known and achieve North American ultra racer) refer to the UTMB (the most well known ultra marathon race in Europe, in which a loop of Mt Blanc taking in 3 countries is done) as &quot;unexpectedly flat&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s some footage of that race: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St49BdhuA8c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St49BdhuA8c</a><p>I look at the course profile for that, and the course profile for the 4 1000m assents for the 75km race I&#x27;m doing in October and think &quot;how do that many people finish&quot;.<p>The US has harder races, which still have remarkably high finishing rates. The &quot;Hard Rock 100&quot; (miles) is basically at times a rope-free scramble up mountain tops, and it has a remarkably high finishing rate (when we&#x27;re talking more that 10% of the field finishing, it&#x27;s remarkable)<p>It&#x27;s quite amazing the variation among ultra races, and 100 miles is not just 100 miles.<p>The interesting thing is that many of the trail / mountain runners need that sort of variation for psychological reasons and find things like 100 mile tarmac races to be more psychologically and physically taxing. A mountain / trail race having highs and lows geologically, mentally, physically but a flat tarmac race having less variation being harder to switch out of a down patch, and requiring serious inner resilience to counter-act a &quot;runners low&quot;.",1427866606

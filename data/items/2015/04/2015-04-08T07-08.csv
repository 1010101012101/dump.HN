Retrofitting planes probably isn&#x27;t going to work. However a whole new approach to sensors and global communications might provide the added information that&#x27;s required for automated flights.<p>Each pilot that has commented seems to be against automation, just because their current work practices are too complex. However that is an engineering problem. Hacking a set of planes to crash is an engineering problem. Its not one that is going to be solved tomorrow, but perhaps in 10 to 15 years when a new generation of planes comes along.<p>My biggest beef isn&#x27;t with flight automation but with trains. Surely that&#x27;s the lowest hanging fruit on the automation tree and we seem to be aiming for the hardest with personal cars and commercial planes.",1428479912

More of a multiyear project where the guy figured he may as well use the best technology because he&#x27;d have plenty of time to learn it. From startup school:<p>..why did you choose Erlang?<p>Jan Koum: Oh. [Laughs] It&#x27;s one of those intuition, intuition, things. I knew nothing about Erlang and when we - I actually we still don&#x27;t; we have a lot of our engineers who do - and we actually have like a really small server team, probably seven or eight people supporting our entire user base on the backend, who are insanely brilliant and who wake up in the middle of the night and fix servers. The thing about Erlang is that I was looking for an open source chat server to drop into this backend that we built that could identify which of your contacts are WhatApp&#x27;s users. I was thinking, we can probably use XMPP, which was an open protocol for messaging, and I was looking for an open source XMPP server and I couldn&#x27;t find one. There was one written in C, but it was outdated. There was another written in Perl and I knew that wouldn&#x27;t be able to scale. And then I came across Erlang -- &quot;What is this Erlang thing&quot; and it was the first time I&#x27;d heard of it and so I began to research. It turned out to be the best engineering decisions we ever made, by just -- we were forced to because there was nothing else to use. It allowed us to scale really well. It&#x27;s like built for what we need to do and it&#x27;s a functional program -- a language that has message passing. It lets you cluster servers into nodes and the others like devalued database that&#x27;s really cool. It can like synchronize all the data across the servers. We obviously tweaked it a lot internally. We have a couple guys who specialize in tuning Erling, but part of it was like we have no choice. It was the only one available at the time and it works really well for us.",1428479901

A lot of the developers on my team are juniors and haven&#x27;t developed the sense of knowing when there has to be an obviously easier way to do something and ask someone or search for it. Standup helps me to see who&#x27;s stuck or where I can help them with an issue that could be done more efficiently from my own trial/error and experience.<p>Overall, I do as much coding/development as anyone else on the team. However, I also identify problems that others on team may not see until they become serious. I also look for ways to make the team more efficient through automation of the more tedious/repetitive aspects of the development process and implement a solution when I have downtime.<p>For example, we have a lot of network/hardware integrations we support and each one requires reconfiguring a database and reloading a couple services. This reconfiguring was being done manually much of the time through the web interface so I tracked down the rows being changed in the db by doing db diffs on each configuration and scripting out the changes that might be different on each developer&#x27;s machine. Instead of manual config, developers just put a few custom constants in a json file, run the script and select the configuration they want to load from a script. That then updates the test db and they can be running/debugging their code in less than a minute instead of up to 10-15 at times (plus time lost from losing focus/train of thought). I know my example is nothing amazing really, but with some developers having to test a couple configurations a day, that time adds up without realizing it. The db schema rarely changes nowadays (maybe once a major version), but if it does, I just have to add a column perhaps at the most to the script and have them run it again after they update their build.",1428479409

I wouldn&#x27;t want to put on a diving suit and weld an oil platform I don&#x27;t know how many meters below sea level - and judging from what it costs to get someone to do it, many people think the same.<p>Lastly, and this is not to dismiss the skill of welding, but a welder is not an &#x27;engineer&#x27;. Welding is a practical skill, not hard to get started with, and 90% of all welding jobs can be done by someone with 6 months of training. It&#x27;s the few highly specialized jobs that take more knowledge and experience, and it&#x27;s there that the money is. In that respect, welding is (dare I say it?) not unlike software development.",1428476797

Share status information immediately. Keep up to date with teammembers constantly.<p>Also, dammit, it&#x27;s not a sync!

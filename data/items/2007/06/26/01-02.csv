It can provide a valuable reference for drawing lines in the sand.<p>Above all, what always comforts me is knowing that most companies half-ass a lot of stuff or get screwed up in some way. Bill Gates remarked how refreshing Steve Jobs is as competition: at least he sticks around, unlike the hordes of competitors he's faced.<p>Companies that really are ready to fight to the death are extremely rare. If you're one of them it doesn't matter how smart or rich the competition is, they should be scared of you.<p>\n",1182823074

There's some neat technology at the core with a pretty poor interface on top (unless you're fairly tech savvy). <p>I think it sounds like an interesting idea, and something that no one has come close to successfully tackling yet.",1182822612
30653,comment,30652,30652,0,0,amichail,,,"For example, an intuitive WYSIWYG word processor is probably full of ugly and unnecessary special cases in the spec.  Intuitive user experiences are often not the most simple and logical ones.<p>I guess part of the reason for this is that you need to preserve backwards compatibility with the user's previous experiences.  And this includes some ugliness from early software.<p>But there's probably also a limit in terms of what average users can understand in terms of what's logical, consistent, and simple.  \n",1182822483

Each problem requires a certain number of thoughts to solve, and the faster you think, the faster you solve those problems.  Carefully choosing which problems you apply your thoughts to will also allow you live longer because if you sidestep a problem you won't spend any time thinking about it.  This leaves you with more time to do with as you choose, which has the effect of making you live longer.  Nifty, huh? :)<p>Thinking faster also has the side effect of giving you a greater influence upon humanity.  If you assume that any given thought has a certain chance of influencing others, then the more thoughts you have, the more influential you can become.<p>But wait, isn't our rate of thought fixed?  I don't think so.  Every single part of us - our muscles, our reading speed, our tools - can all be improved.  Why should our rate of thinking be the exception?<p>I was driving home from work today and stumbled upon this theory.  I want to enrich at least one other person's day with it, as it enriched mine.  So, to all of you, I encourage you to spend time thinking of ways to <i>think faster</i>, <i>think more</i>, and <i>think smarter</i>.  It will make you live longer and add value to anything you apply yourself to.<p>Shawn\n",1182821510

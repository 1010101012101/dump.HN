I also would like to add this excerpt by Nassim Taleb on  <i>""creation of bacterial cell controlled by chemically synthesized genome""</i> * (<a href=""http://www.edge.org/discourse/creation/creation_index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edge.org/discourse/creation/creation_index.html</a>)<p><i>If I understand this well, to the creationists, this should be an insult to God; but, further, to the evolutionist, this is certainly an insult to evolution. And to the risk manager/probabilist, like myself & my peers, this is an insult to human Prudence, the beginning of the mother-of-all exposure to Black Swans. Let me explain.<p>Evolution (in complex systems) proceeds by undirected, convex bricolage or tinkering, inherently robust, i.e., with the achievement of potential stochastic gains thanks to continuous and repetitive small, near-harmless mistakes. What men have done with top-down, command-and-control science has been exactly the reverse: concave interventions, i.e., the achievement of small certain gains through exposure to massive stochastic mistakes (coming from the natural incompleteness in our understanding of systems). Our record in understanding risks in complex systems (biology, economics, climate) has been pitiful, marred with retrospective distortions (we only understand the risks after the damage takes place), and there is nothing to convince me that we have gotten better at risk management. In this particular case, because of the scalability of the errors, you are exposed to the wildest possible form of informational uncertainty (even more than markets), producing tail risks of unheard proportions.<p>I have an immense respect for Craig Venter, whom I consider one of the smartest men who ever breathed, but, giving fallible humans such powers is similar to giving a small child a bunch of explosives.</i><p>Edit: note that I obviously don't support any lunatics sending bombs",1316260397

3007825,comment,3007140,3007351,2,0,_delirium,,,"That's an interesting angle, though I'd personally rate the higher risk being humans who <i>do</i> have agency over technology. Technology is a human ability multiplier, which is a problem if the ability includes destruction. The 20th century brought nuclear weapons, for example, which have been kept remarkably out of use through, I think, a combination of luck and extreme suppression. It just so happens that some of the engineering challenges in making a nuclear weapon are particularly hard to DIY, even when you understand the science (fuel enrichment is apparently the most significant bottleneck, with a secondary bottleneck at actual weapon construction). And then governments make extensive efforts to keep any sort of nuclear DIY scene from developing, to make sure that even harmless science-fair type versions of practical nuclear knowledge don't arise ""in the wild"".<p>Will that all also be true for 21st-century destructive technologies? If any technology appears where one person could kill 20 million people with it, either it will have to be <i>very</i> hard to DIY, we'll have to be very good at suppressing it, or likely, both simultaneously.",1316259822

Depending on the language and ORM you use, you'll need to write code that resembles this:<p><pre><code>    result = execute(query);

3007803,comment,3005831,3006792,5,0,agravier,,,"I switched from Gentoo (4 years user) to Arch (now 4 years) and although the ""close to the internals"" philosophy are similar, which may make the two distros look the similar, the two are not comparable. Gentoo compiles from scratch by default, and is a real time sink in terms of maintainance. Gentoo is much more complex, I mean that for you as sysadmin of your own computer, the number of ""free variables"" to tune in gentoo is much greater than in Arch. Often, you end up over-optimizing your Gentoo box. In the end, more packages end up not working or not able to accept some input or plug-ins because of some compilation detail, for instance in my experience.<p>However, Gentoo is closer to LFS. I learnt the details of manual configuration and compilation of the linux kernel thanks to Gentoo. I learnt initrc, set up the logging system I wanted, etc... What I learnt using Gentoo lets me sail through Arch administration with zero hassle. After fixing my Gentoo box numerous times, I understand the compromise that is made in Arch between power, simplicity of administration and time consumed doing real work. Arch maintains a ""pro"" feeling, does not try to hide the internals, while keeping a minimal number of ""free variables"" for you to tweak. Does that make Arch primitive? Maybe, and in that case, I like primitiveness inmy distros.",1316258298

Part of this time will be tuning your custom queries.<p>- the ORM promise that it's queries are RDBMS independent is not broken<p>>> Another point: your ORM would automatically pick up changes to your model and cope with it, not your hand-written SQL, making your code harder to maintain.<p>Writing everything by hand (known alternative 1 from the article) makes your code even harder to maintain because there will be zero changes that are automatically picked up.<p>Depending on the KV store you use, his second alternative may not have this problem.<p>TLDR:

Generally it&#x27;s best <i>not</i> to put inflations in written form, for practical reasons. The answer to &quot;Should I lie on my CV?&quot; is almost always &quot;no&quot;.

It&#x27;s one of the last steps for licensure as a professional engineer.<p>Some states, like Texas, are extremely picky about who calls themselves an engineer, irrespective of industrial exemption (which the vast majority of people fall under). PE licensure in other engineering areas (like civil engineering) is required to offer services to the public, helps when offering expert testimony, and can be required for principals at consulting firms. The software engineering PE is an extension of IEEE&#x27;s efforts in software engineering, and is probably a good thing for safety-critical industries.<p>Since passing the fundamentals of engineering (FE) exam is (usually) a prerequisite, someone who has a PE in software engineering probably knows their way around a free body diagram or Laplace transforms or MSD systems, i.e., stuff the other engineering fields do.",1408207295

Before you&#x27;ve even started, you&#x27;ve limited your potential contributor base to those who are willing to install not only your choice of compiler (not such a problem on Linux or MacOS, at least) but maybe even a specific version of that compiler (much more of a problem, because usually dev tools are installed system-wide).<p>Do these projects expect that everyone will just set up a dedicated VM with exactly the right development environment for their code or something?

But at least there is a testable prediction!  In my opinion, the fact that they offer a testable prediction merits a more thorough consideration of the claims.<p>First of all, it has been well understood for multiple decades that the General Relativity(GR) breaks down, and is no longer true, at mass/energy scales that are present inside of a black hole.  This is known because physical quantities must be finite, but GR predicts the strength of a gravitational field inside of a black hole is infinite.  If string theory is true (and I don&#x27;t believe it is), then this would be a valid situation to apply it to, since we know that there is unknown physics at play inside of a black hole.<p>Furthermore, the standard big bang cosmology is based on the idea that the beginning of time is a &quot;black hole in time&quot;, in the sense that as t->0, the strength of the gravitational field diverges to infinity.  Thus, it has been well known for decades that GR is not a valid physical theory at very short time scales after the beginning of time (this would be the epoch of inflation[3]).<p>It is perhaps not apparent to the casual observer that this paper is based on a very bizarre sect within string theory, known as the &quot;Holographic Universe&quot;, which according to Wikipedia &quot;suggests that the entire universe can be seen as a two-dimensional information structure &quot;painted&quot; on the cosmological horizon&quot;.  This is just a bunch of fancy words designed to blow smoke in your eyes, and the entire theory is sort of a joke as far as most physicists I know are concerned.<p>There are actually a number of strange cults within string theory, another one that is good for a laugh is the Anthropic Princple[4].  This theory claims that even though the 11 dimensional D-Brane that is folded into a Calubi-Yau manifold upon which string theory is based predicts trillions of possible universes, the universe we live in exists because it is the only possible one we could live in:<p>&quot;the conditions happen to be just right for the existence of (intelligent) life on the earth at the present time. For if they were not just right, then we should not have found ourselves to be here now, but somewhere else, at some other appropriate time.&quot;<p>This kind of nonsense is why I left research in theoretical physics to purse computer science and programming, which truly is the cutting edge of science.  There is a lot of valuable physics research going on in material science departments(for example), but the string theory department needs to constantly justify their funding by making extremely bold claims such as &quot;what we perceive as the Big Bang could be the three-dimensional “mirage” of a collapsing star in a universe profoundly different than our own&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-brane"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-brane</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle</a>",1408205601

Most of you will probably recall those debates in the context of somatic cell nuclear transfer, embryonic stem cells, and therapeutic cloning, but the various appointed bodies pontificated on aging and longevity science as well. Generally to say how terrible it was to even think about extending healthy human life, but hey, what can you expect? That is more or less the default position that most people still hold today [2].<p>To a certain degree one has to come to terms with the fact that most people in the world hold incoherent views on the topic of aging to death. If asked most of them say they want to: they want to do exactly the same thing they see other people doing. Conformity is a hell of a drug. But if asked if they want to suffer heart disease or Alzheimer&#x27;s, they don&#x27;t want that.<p>Then there is the hairshirt environmentalist death cult that tells us we&#x27;re destroying the world, there are too many people, and we should all die. That is not actually much of an exaggeration of the actual viewpoints espoused. This has so pervaded society that you can find the average person on the street is concerned about living too long because they are someone burning up a limit faster. It&#x27;s ridiculous. People look at the horrible consequences of war and kleptocracy in various regions [3], and buy into the propaganda that this would somehow go away if fewer people were involved: that it isn&#x27;t the mass murder, or the oppression, or the theft of resources, or the enforced poverty, but just a matter of how many people there are. They fuse this into the desire to confirm to the lives of their parents, and justify the continued lemming-like walk towards the suffering and pain and disease of aging.<p>But if you ask them if we should cure any of those diseases, they&#x27;re all for that. They just don&#x27;t want to live longer. But this is the greatest incoherence: age-related diseases are age-related diseases because they are caused by the underlying processes of aging. The only true cure is to repair the damage of aging [4] that causes these diseases. As for all machines, if you fix the damage it lasts longer in good condition [5]. Extension of healthy life and true cures for age-related disease are flip sides of the same coin.<p>And if treatments for aging were widespread and available, all those people who say they want to die on the same schedule as their parents would use them, and live longer, and get over it. But without their support the necessary research will not run fast enough to save most of them. They&#x27;ll die for their wrong ideas, right on the eve of the transition to a world of indefinite life spans achieved through medical science that can control the causes of aging.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC423155/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC423155/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/08/there-is-no-overpopulation-only-waste-corruption-and-inhumanity.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/08/there-is-no-over...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_theory_of_aging_and_longevity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_theory_of_aging_and...</a>",1408205051

Many of the subprojects in pfff have a literate document that is synchronized with the code using syncweb (e.g <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/pfff/blob/master/h_visualization/Treemap.tex.nw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/pfff/blob/master/h_visualization...</a> ). When I have errors in my code, or when I debug my code, I do it on the generated code, not the tex document, so of course if there is a fix it&#x27;s easier to fix the code directly and far later to synchronize.",1408204981

I tried a few hours on Filezilla before deciding that it&#x27;s just too messed up.",1408204849

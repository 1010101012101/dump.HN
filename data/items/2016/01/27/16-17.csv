The next time I’m looking for a job, I’ll try\nthis:<p>“Most Illustrious Proprietor, Having now sufficiently considered the specimens of all those who proclaim\nthemselves skilled developers of applications of business, and that the invention and operation of the said\nprograms are nothing different from those in common use: I shall endeavor, without prejudice to any one else,\nto explain myself to your Company, showing your Management my secret, and then offering them to your\nbest pleasure and approbation to work with effect at opportune moments on all those things which, in part,\nshall be briefly noted below.<p>1. I have a sort of extremely light and strong functions and modules, adapted to be most easily ftp’d, and with\nthem you may pursue, and at any time combine them with others, secure and indestructible by standard mean\ntime to failure of hardware and denial of service, easy and convenient to compile and catalog. Also methods\nof unzipping and storing the data of the customers.<p>2. I know how, when a website is besieged, to shard data onto the cloud, and make endless variety of mirrors,\nand fault tolerant disks and RAIDs, and other machines pertaining to such concerns.<p>3. If, by reason of the volume of the data, or the structure of the btrees and its indexes, it is impossible, when\nconducting a search, to avail oneself of sub-second response time, I have methods for benchmarking every\nprocess or other function, even if it were interpreted, etc.<p>4. Again, I have kinds of functions; most convenient and easy to ftp; and with these I can spawn lots of data\nalmost resembling a torrent; and with the download of these cause great terror to the competitor, to his great\ndetriment and confusion.<p>5. And if the processing should be on the desktop I have apps of many machines most efficient for data entry\nand reporting; and utilities which will satisfy the needs of the most demanding customers and users and\nconsumers.<p>6. I have means by secret and tortuous scripts and modules, made without leaving tracks, to generate source\ncode, even if it were needed to run on a client or a server.<p>7. I will make secure firewalls, safe and unattackable, which, entering among the hackers with their utilities,\nthere is no body of crackers so great but they would break them. And behind these, software could run quite\nunhurt and without any hindrance.<p>8. In case of need I will make big properties, methods, and collections and useful forms, out of the common\ntype.<p>9. Where the operation of compiling might fail, I would contrive scripts, functions, routines, and other\nparameter driven processes of marvellous efficacy and not in common use. And in short, according to the\nvariety of cases, I can contrive various and endless means of data entry, reporting, and storage.<p>10. In times of low revenue I believe I can give perfect satisfaction and to the equal of any other in\nmaintenance and the refactoring of code public and private; and in guiding data from one warehouse to\nanother.<p>11. I can carry out code in Javascript, PHP, or C, and also I can do in network administration whatever may be\ndone, as well as any other, be he who he may.\nAgain, the intranet app may be taken in hand, which is to be to the immortal glory and eternal honor of all\nyour customers of happy memory, and of the illustrious house of Google.\nAnd if any of the above-named things seem to anyone to be impossible or not feasible, I am most ready to\nmake the experiment in your data center, or in whatever place may please your Businessperson - to whom I\ncomment myself with the utmost humility, etc.”",1453913971

I have a friend who does welding for the navy and was called in to replace part of the hull of a nuclear sub due to a very hilarious design flaw. It was >6&quot; thick and took days to fill in... with steel.\n2. I&#x27;ve read &quot;Concepts of Submarine Design&quot; which goes into great detail on the principles and systems of military sub design. The authors make the case that getting <i>more</i> weight is often a problem. This makes sense because every foot or air space needs to be displaced by more weight in the steel of the sub. So if they had a problem with subs weighing too little, they could just make them more spacious. And they&#x27;re not very spacious.",1453913910

10981143,comment,10979452,10980256,0,0,yodon,,,"The body&#x27;s resistance is generally not what matters, it&#x27;s generally the resistance of the connection between the body and the power source. If the connection is made via an air-gap spark you can need thousands of volts to ionize the air to allow the spark to form which allows the current to enter the body (corresponding to tens of thousands of ohms at a killing current, although that resistance is highly non-linear and drops suddenly after the initial spark connection ionizes the air). If the connection is made via EEG or EKG leads attached with conductive paste, the connection resistance can be a fraction of an ohm and the killing voltage can be well under 100 volts. The highly variable nature of the connection resistance is just one reason why the killing threshold is generally described in terms of amps rather than volts. If you&#x27;re worried about whether a circuit could kill a patient and you must think in terms of voltage, you&#x27;re not worried about whether you know the body&#x27;s resistance, you&#x27;re worried about whether you know the connection resistance.<p>In practice pretty much everyone who designs safety critical systems where electrocution is a concern focuses on current because it&#x27;s a much better way to model and analyze the system risks than voltage.",1453913893

He was never given any benefit from the party large enough to convince him to give Clinton her the title shot with only token resistance.  And he&#x27;s so unexpectedly popular that they can&#x27;t squeeze him out of the media coverage quietly enough to make him drop out.<p>And then I go to take off my foil hat, and find that I thought that stupid conspiracy theory up <i>bareheaded</i>.

There are plenty of foods that are high volume and low calorie at the same time: salads, fruits, groats, whole bread and cereals. Also, the funny thing is that foods that appear high calories, like meat, are not inherently like that. Meat is pretty low in calories until you start to fry it.<p>EDIT: I wrote my comment in hurry, so I will now take some time to clarify my point.<p>Feeling hungry comes from the fact that eating foods rich in sugar and fat puts your insulin levels at a roller coaster, going up and down like crazy.

There is evidence that it can vary somewhat not just by age and gender, but the results are noisy enough within tightly controlled test groups that it varies per individual. Where there isn&#x27;t an obvious cause for this such as diabetes, differences in gut microbiome are suspected to be key.<p>Everything you said is still correct of course. This variation just adds wrinkle to it, but a small enough one that &quot;calories in&quot; against &quot;calories out&quot; is accurate enough for the vast majority of the population (i.e. those without significant medical issues).<p>If you are aware of this there is nothing wrong with exercising more so you can eat more, just be careful not to bias your diet by making the extra all &quot;bad food&quot; or you risk being the right weight but unhealthy in a number of other ways.

A lot of the latency advantage right now is in being able to cancel a few levels near the midpoint while leaving tons of other orders stacked.<p>Reducing tick sizes would make these deep stacking strategies less viable, which seems (though I have no proof) like it would make the positions of the market makers less risky in a systematic way.<p>As for GOOG vs MSFT, I think that is obviously explained by the much higher price of GOOG right?

To me, Da Vinci is up there in the &quot;alien&quot; category along with Von Neumann... there is no field in which he not only excelled, but formed theories that were centuries ahead of their time.<p>Not only in art and engineering, but in medicine and biology. In his notebooks you can find rudimentary ideas about evolution (in his study of fossils, he notes that different layers have different kinds, and that those at the bottom appear to be the oldest; he then notes that the Earth must be much older than his peers seem to think!). In medicine he noted that the arteries of people who suffer from heart attacks are hardened and thickly coated (another discovery that was not made until the 20th century).<p>There is also misconceptions about whether some of his designs worked. It was common back then (before IP laws) for inventors to insert crucial flaws into the schemes, with codified solutions that only they know, so that only they could build the product.<p>For example, his gliding machine, lacking a tail, will bomb. Unless you are astute enough to notice the pages where he writes down his theories about how birds use their tail to stabilize their flight!<p>Lo and behold, after adding a tail, the glider works: <a href=""http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/leonardo/glider.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/leonardo/glider.html</a><p>The list goes on.

He was not just a great painter and engineer, e was truly a once in a generation mind; and all without formal training -- just his imagination and thought experiments.\nPerhaps too far ahead of his time... imagine how far we&#x27;d be had further pursued his wild ideas!<p>His facsimiles are also available in print, and offer a fascinating insight into a one of a kind mind.",1453911755

The assumption here is that passing a Google interview is /the/ bar for success as a software engineer. Guy builds homebrew (success) and guy fails google interview (fail). Cognitive dissonance!<p>It&#x27;s not surprising that there are a diverse set of skills required for building good software, especially if one is playing every role by themselves. Then it&#x27;s also not surprising that at a large corporate environment, each one of these roles are usually taken on by separate people, and there is a lot more specialization. Then it&#x27;s not surprising that they&#x27;re ignoring all the other skills this person brings to the table - they&#x27;re probably going to be squandered. It&#x27;s also not surprising that a large corporation with a massive inflow of great candidates is going to have a diluted and uninteresting interview process because no matter what they&#x27;re doing, they&#x27;re going to get some good or at least motivated people one way or the other. It&#x27;s yet again unsurprising that they fail to take their own advice when their internal studies find out that brain teaser questions or questions that don&#x27;t have anything to do with the day to day work don&#x27;t really predict success, because I think a lot of people who are established there passed through that bar, and ascribe their success to it despite the evidence. So it&#x27;s a cultural change issue too.<p>Anyway, I got rejected by google when I was in college, and I took it personally at first, and now I don&#x27;t.

Clean your pan thoroughly after each use by washing it with soap and water and scrubbing out any gunk or debris from the bottom.

The idea was that the wood &quot;cured&quot; over the years, making ever more exquisite salads. Actually, the dressing seeped into the wood and the oil turned hideously rancid, so the bowls stank to high heaven.<p>> A sly foodie named George Rector had simply hoaxed the whole country. He&#x27;d invented the myth of the wooden salad bowl to spice up a story in the Sept. 5, 1936, issue of the Saturday Evening Post.<p>> Playing on Americans&#x27; fear of snobbish French gourmets, he painted green salad as the most finicky dish of all. And the secret of the perfect salad? Rubbing a clove of garlic on a wooden bowl, which would give just enough garlic flavor but not (horrors!) too much . . . and then never washing the bowl.<p>> The French themselves had never believed any such thing. In fact, Parisian gourmets didn&#x27;t even like garlic in their salads--as Rector knew perfectly well, since he&#x27;d worked in Parisian restaurants. In his cookbooks, he had published garlic-free French salad recipes.<p>Sounds like exactly the same belief.",1453911264

There is no opportunity for the fast operator to get in front of the order as the GP describes.<p>You can verify this easily for any exchange you like (at least SEC regulated ones in the US) by reading the technical specifications of the electronic trading platform.<p>I don&#x27;t know what google search or RBC story you are talking about, but in Flash Boys for instance, they make pains to imply that HFT are front running orders as the GP describes but they never say it outright.

The work we&#x27;ve done so far is about as real world as a beginner could hope for, we think. Mind you, up to section 8 pretty much <i>has</i> to be toyish programs of a few lines of code so as not to bamboozle the reader, because they know very little up to there. These sections are tiny for that reason - to keep them interested.<p>We&#x27;re slowly releasing the sections for free. Just released another one today (Section 8). It won&#x27;t be until Section 9 that we start to encounter programs that one could see how they might be truly useful if more work was done on them.<p>Finding all the movies in your movie collection that start with a letter in the first half of the alphabet is pretty toy, for example (in Section 9) :) - that&#x27;s the next section we&#x27;ll release for free on the site. However, we can start to see how that could easily become something useful - like maybe a DVD collection manager database kind of thing, with a bit more coding.<p>Then, when at around Section 17, we know enough Haskell to be able to read small, but real programs: a times-table &quot;game&quot;, and a tiny adventure game (it only has 2 rooms). These are trivial non-real programs from a real-world perspective, but they contain a lot of the elements needed for real programs, and are the precursor to reading beginner to intermediate programs.<p>We think that our book <i>is</i> unique, because we don&#x27;t see anything like it anywhere else. Here&#x27;s why:<p>The frustrations with the Haskell ecosystem up to this point is that learning from nothing is a real chore. LYAH and RWH are the only free to read purportedly-beginner books, but both of them start assuming that Haskell is the second language, and they&#x27;re both very out of date.<p>LYAH doesn&#x27;t use full programs to illustrate topics, so gives no context (which means things don&#x27;t stick in your mind), while RWH does do this, but manages to put the reader to sleep while they&#x27;re reading it because it&#x27;s not written well and poorly edited (not to be mean here... Bryan O&#x27;Sullivan has actually said on his blog that they should have edited it more carefully: <a href=""http://www.serpentine.com/blog/2014/03/18/book-review-parallel-and-concurrent-programming-in-haskell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.serpentine.com/blog/2014/03/18/book-review-parall...</a> - in comparison, this book by Simon Marlow that he&#x27;s writing a review for where he complains about his own writing, is excellent writing).<p>However, none of the books or tutorials around seem to take the time or care to explain the absolute basics: things like the fact that Haskell operates in a massively different way than almost every other single programming language there is: a world that is entirely pure. Where in order to do IO, you don&#x27;t write commands, but rather, you have to use pure functions to compose building blocks (IO values) which are descriptions of execution, for later execution. We bandy about phrases like &quot;purely functional&quot;, but don&#x27;t tackle this head on.<p>To our mind, this is one of Haskell&#x27;s greatest strengths, yet it&#x27;s usually shunted to the mid or back of books because it&#x27;s difficult to explain, or an advanced topic, or it&#x27;s been misunderstood in the past, or because authors feel like they need to get readers to Monad before or when they get to IO. We don&#x27;t agree with this.<p>By separating out the passive (reading programs) from the active (creating programs), we think learning can be rapid and things can be understood through large amounts of examples. In the 80&#x27;s, this is how we learned to program, and it works. You take someone else&#x27;s program and you type it in! You adjust it, and see what happens. Once you&#x27;ve done that about 50 times, you start to understand what&#x27;s going on. Take that and add an explaining commenter, and you have our methodology for teaching :)<p>So the IO thing alone, we believe, is a reason our material is fundamentally better. Couple that with practice and example-first teaching (showing examples before, or with theory, not after), appropriate drawings, subject-driven learning (rather than programming-topic-driven), and breadth-first rather than depth-first teaching, and we feel like this series is completely unique. LYAH in contrast does depth-first, and the example code suffers from it massively, not to mention the impact on the reader&#x27;s attention span in the latter half of the book.<p>What we mean here by subject-driven learning is interesting. Say we want to show the reader a number of things, so we introduce them in the guise of a program that &quot;happens&quot; to need to use those things (we&#x27;ve selected it precisely because it does, actually). That way, their focus is on the topic of the example programs, rather than something related to programming like &quot;singly linked lists&quot; or &quot;Functor&quot;, or &quot;folds&quot;. We introduce several topic that deal with a particular programming topic, and before you know it, they understand how Lists work, because they&#x27;ve seen them explained 10 times in different examples. We call this &quot;Using interest to drive repetition&quot;.<p>Each section includes (mostly) at least one &quot;full&quot; program. That is, a program you can enter and run yourself if you have Haskell installed. Granted, they&#x27;re very small programs up to section 8 or 9, but the sections are very small, too. That&#x27;s the idea. We want examples to drive the education, and then introduce theory to back it up later.<p>Yeah, so, Volume 1 (this one) is primarily about building the reader up to where they can make sense of beginner level programs, and start to construct the absolute basics themselves (essentially &quot;what&#x27;s your name&quot;-like programs with input). We&#x27;ve purposefully kept it light and small to increase motivation.<p>The next _Volume_, though, will likely get to the point where we&#x27;ll introduce some much more useful beginner programs, and get the reader to be able to write some basic beginner programs. We&#x27;re pretty limited with the sorts of things we can introduce at the very beginning because IO is such a difficult and loaded topic in Haskell, and we want to keep the amount of information covered in each section down to a bare minimum to keep interest high.<p>There&#x27;s a lot one has to understand to be able to just understand what&#x27;s going on with how to read IO actions, let alone to use them, so we introduce &quot;just enough&quot; so that the reader can understand programs written with it, but not necessarily fully understand what&#x27;s happening behind the sugar of a do block (let alone trying to comprehend what&#x27;s going on in something &quot;real world&quot; like a Snap web application).<p>Sorry for the diatribe :) I obviously find this stuff massively fascinating, and it seems you do, too.<p>We&#x27;d absolutely love it if the sales for the book took off. Maybe they will once we release more of the book for free. We&#x27;re working on it as quickly as we can, so we&#x27;ll see I guess :) Exciting!",1453910525

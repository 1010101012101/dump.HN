6425141,comment,6424280,6424897,2,0,mchughj,,,"JPKab, I liked the first part of your response.  It was accurate and based on fact.  Good stuff.   Mark&#x27;s break from the crossfit community is well documented.  And also with good reason.  You and others have captured it well - olympic lifts executed at high volume carry significant risks.<p>But the rest of your post is garbage.  &quot;Monetizations schemes&quot; and &quot;racket&quot;(s)?  Two things here:<p>1/  Any intelligent person that starts a crossfit &quot;box&quot; could start a big gym that appeals more widely and make significantly more money.  True, they would need more initial capital for the equipment.  True, they would have to operate on far lower margins.  But at the end of the day they would make more money signing up 1,000 people for $25 a month than signing up 100 people for $200 a  month.  Gym memberships are nothing more than a subscription service which is subject to the decaying population problem.  It is about scale here.<p>2/  The majority of the crossfit community really, really buy into the entire thing.  And nothing associated with that &quot;thing&quot; is about money.  It is about fitness and community.<p>The vast majority of people that start crossfit boxes are doing so because they love crossfit.  Not money.  Please don&#x27;t respond here with the handful of boxes that are about money because at any scale you will find outliers and these outliers don&#x27;t represent the norm.<p>Crossfit people are fanatical about fitness and community.  Not money.  They prescribe to a very specific workout methodology.  If you don&#x27;t like crossfit then attack it for the faults that are at its core.  Like functional movements (including Olympic movements) executed at high intensity.  Somewhat insane, yes.<p>Don&#x27;t create additional issues that could be potential found in a minority.<p>Here is a request for you.  Feel free to ignore but if you are serious in terms of your views then try it out.  (And if you aren&#x27;t then just announce your troll status and be done with it.)  Visit 12 crossfit gyms.  You don&#x27;t have to do the workouts there, don&#x27;t pay a dime, just visit them and watch the class.  Then ask yourself the following question, &quot;If I wanted to make more money (that is if I were really an industry that devolved from a &#x27;movement and then into a business and then finally a racket&#x27; - paraphrased from you) what would I do differently?&quot;<p>If <i>you</i> can come up half a dozen answers to this question then I submit to you that your statement &quot;it started as a movement, turned into a business, and then devolved into a racket&quot; is wrong.",1379807933

6425096,comment,6424692,6424866,10,0,legutierr,,,"I think there is a clear distinction that you can make between an SQL injection attack and the unsecured API that weev accessed.  SQL injection attacks depend on inserting malicious code into an application in order to traverse that application and access systems that stand behind it.  The point of SQL injection is to circumvent restricted permissions that the owner of the server has attempted to impose.<p>What weev did was quite different in that he accessed this web service in exactly the <i>way</i> it was intended.  Even if he was not the intended consumer of this data, his attempted access never exceeded the defined and expected parameters of the API he was accessing.  Furthermore, he didn&#x27;t <i>circumvent</i> [1] any access restrictions; rather, access restrictions were never imposed.  weev had no information available to himself as to AT&T&#x27;s intent to disclose or not disclose customer emails; as far as he was concerned, the existence of this API could have been a purposeful and not simply negligent disclosure on the part of AT&T.<p>I think that the reason that the weev case rankles is that web developers do this kind of thing all the time.  What is the difference between what weev did here and Padmapper did when it built a product on top of Craigslist&#x27;s data?  Despite Eric DeMenthon&#x27;s protests to the contrary, a strong argument to could be made that Padmapper&#x27;s intent was to cause severe commercial harm to Craigslist, which is conceivably why he got sued.  In spite of the civil case, however, criminal charges are almost unthinkable.<p>Also, how often do we read about someone&#x27;s project being hampered when a private Google API is turned off? [2]  Anyone that builds a commercial product on top of something like this would be deemed a fool, but I&#x27;ve never seen anyone accuse a developer who is using this kind of API of acting criminally.<p>What is the difference, under the law, between someone accessing a private Google API and the private AT&T API that weev accessed?  As a web developer with zero documentation, zero information beyond simply knowledge of the API URL&#x27;s existence, there is no apparent difference beyond what content was being served by these APIs.  So, if that is the case, at what point should web developers accessing undocumented APIs begin to be concerned about their criminal liability?<p>[1] Shouldn&#x27;t it be <i>circumvention</i> not <i>authorization</i> that that defines criminal access under the law?<p>[2] Just the easiest-to-find example: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4441677"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4441677</a>",1379807140

6425064,comment,6422653,6422653,1,0,beloch,,,"The cyclical recurrence of interglacial and glacial periods (we&#x27;re technically still in one of these) can theoretically be explained by cyclically evolving properties of the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the sun such as the precession of the Earth&#x27;s ratational axis (google Milankovitch cycles). This theory is consistent with the gradual cooling trend observed thus far into the Holocene epoch, and predicts it will continue for tens of thousands of years. The linked graph shows this very nicely.<p>A sudden, full-blown glacial period would be far more disastrous for human civilization than significant global warming. The latter would submerge densely populated coastal areas and force humans to move to the new coastlines, but the overall capacity of the Earth to support life would increase, just as it did at the start of the Holocene. The former would result in a large reduction in the Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity and global famine.<p>Any change in the Earth&#x27;s temperature is going to be disruptive to both human civilization and the existence of other species on Earth. We have reversed the effects of several thousand years of cooling in just a couple of centuries and, assuming we are able to continue extracting and burning hydrocarbons at an unabated pace indefinitely (dubious) we could significantly change the face of the world, but it will still support our civilization, just in a very changed state. Avoiding the pain of this change is ample incentive to curb the use of hydrocarbons. (Edit: It has taken centuries and a significant portion of the world&#x27;s hydrocarbon reserves to produce less than a degree of warming. At this rate, even if we evaded peak-oil for another thousand years the Earth will still be in a glacial period.)<p>However, we should be much more aware of events that could trigger another glacial period.  Megaeruptions or large meteor impacts could plunge global temperatures suddenly and catastrophically. These are far greater threats to our species, but we are both incapable of adequately predicting them or preventing them if we do predict them. The probability of this sort of event happening in a single human lifespan is remote, while global warming is a certainty, but these events will eventually occur with certainty. Managing global warming is certainly a good idea for the comfort of our civilization, but we should have more eyes on the bigger threats. (Edit: Even if we tried, we would be unable to maintain global warming indefinitely simply by burning hydrocarbons. In the ten-thousand year time-frame we will need to find other ways to combat gradual cooling.)",1379806564

The main difficulties we faced were payment options and lack of control over the user experience.<p>Payment options: While the situation is slightly better in the US, accepting micropayments is still very difficult. You can basically count on losing 25-40% of the end user price to payment processors. More if you accept credit cards. But with Mastercard Secure et al. rolled out all over Europe these are useless for mobile anyway thanks to the abysmal usability of those systems. In-app payments don&#x27;t work because those are only permitted for virtual goods (though I&#x27;ve seen some competitors do it for a few months before being shut down). Selling batches of cards (we called them &quot;voucher codes&quot;) is a neat workaround but customers aren&#x27;t huge fans of the idea in my experience.<p>Lack of control over user experience: You can spend as much time and money as you want on making the app perfect and perfecting the print process (sth. the Sharktank guy didn&#x27;t do--since when are postcard glossy on both sides?). In the end you hand the card to the mail carriers and those suck all. I&#x27;d estimate that 1% of cards don&#x27;t arrive due to mail carrier error, with USPS causing so much trouble that the US market seemed unatttractive. Those 1% of disappointed customers whose card didn&#x27;t arrive are 50% of your app store reviews and 100% of your Paypal disputes. And because a postcard is a physical product, Paypal will ask the vendor for a tracking number. Don&#x27;t have one? Get your Paypal account frozen.<p>What surprised me in Sharktank episode is that they guy who invested seemed to consider the idea novel when in truth it&#x27;s been tried and tested since the first opening of the app store. I haven&#x27;t been involved with that app for several years now but they seem to still operate and last time I checked I could find around 20 competitors.

From what I hear, one goal of ending climate change is to allow icecaps to re-form and to last longer throughout the year, which ostensibly will end the suffering of polar bears &quot;stranded&quot; at sea. However, even if we <i>did</i> remove all excess amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere (which, as of today, is something that&#x27;s <i>barely</i> discussed seriously), it&#x27;s not going to suddenly reverse the adapted behavior of polar bears. This is a totally hypothetical and unscientific story, but let&#x27;s pretend that the ice caps melted such that polar bears were forced inland and began foraging for food in human-populated areas. In response, the government of Canada single-handedly puts up the money to remove all excess greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Over a period of decades, the ice grows back, but: do we really expect the polar bear population, which has now adapted to foraging for garbage, to suddenly move <i>back</i> to their initial habitat? Chances are, food will be more plentiful for them in a human-populated area. Now let&#x27;s assume that polar bears play a significant role in seal population control. Well, now that the polar bears have adapted and are now living further inland, the seal population booms in the arctic region. In fact, it gets so big, that now penguin populations are in rapid decline! So, at this point, we&#x27;ve spent probably trillions of dollars, haven&#x27;t really <i>helped</i> the polar bears at all, and have directly contributed to the endangerment of penguins. <i>And this is all assuming that our plan even works!</i> Not to mention the fact that there may be other species that died off that played a huge impact on balancing the ice-filled arctic ecosystem.<p>So, given that scenario, I think the better question to ask is, what benefit would we, as humans, get from a return to a cooler Earth? IMO wildlife will take care of itself: adapt, die off, etc. the same way it always has. BUT, I think that too often the focus is put on sad-looking animals and melted snowcaps, which makes it seem like global warming is just an &quot;environmentalist&quot; issue rather than a serious threat to human life.",1379805761

The happiness of individual members of a peer group doesn&#x27;t say much about how that group compares to its own peer groups at the next level up, which in this case would be other national economies and economic schools of thought.<p>Put another way, I imagine the World Happiness Index published last week by the U.N.

6424969,comment,6424654,6424654,8,0,usernew1817,,,"Here&#x27;s my 2 cents, I worked as an intern (coop) and have subsequently worked in other tech companies in Waterloo that have ex-RIM employees. \nI think the problem was mainly managers, a lot of the managers didn&#x27;t program, some held cs degrees but they hadn&#x27;t programmed in a while to the point where they really couldn&#x27;t really access the code, so basically never really looked at code (the code itself was ok because other programmers did). However, what did happen was a lot of managers started accessing their team based on how much they looked like they were doing, in short how busy they looked. Some of the smartest developers are terrible and office politics, emails and at meetings . Without emails or engaging in meetings it gave an impression that the developers didn&#x27;t care, I&#x27;ve seen some incredible developers get fired because they didn&#x27;t fit the &quot;company culture.&quot; This was acceptable because &quot;company culture&quot; was in at the time, but it was just a way to support manager bias. For example, I knew this guy who would usually come to work late and only answer emails at lunch and keep a fairly chill attitude, but would usually stay late 6-7 until he did his 8+ hours, however in the eyes of the manager who was there from 9-5, the picture looked completely different, he was fired a few months later. Now I was there for a short time and only part of one team, so I can&#x27;t speak for the whole organization, but I&#x27;ve worked for other tech firms in the area whose managers were ex-RIM and they basically did the exact same thing. In short, \n1) having mangers that are heading an engineering team should be programming\n2) employees should be peer-reviewed and not at the mercy of the managers (a lot of sucking up happens when the manager has that much power)<p>This probably isn&#x27;t the main thing that killed RIM, there were probably hundreds of reasons, but over time this put in a culture of complacency, and there probably isn&#x27;t much upper management could have done, because it was all done for the sake of improving &quot;company culture&quot;",1379804623

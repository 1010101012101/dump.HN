Assuming you have something like 256M of RAM (like many small VPSs) running at 170M means that a relatively small spike could cause things to start having memory errors. Is there some way to mitigate this, other than enabling swap?",1275994643

As the article points out, being taxed is _not_ same as being forbidden.<p>Also, there seem to be _two_ agendas for the tax: 1)raising tax money and 2) discouraging consumption of ""empty calories.""  I can't tell from the story whether legislators have prioritized between the two.<p>If it's the first... then bottled water (who virtue/worth is a whole other discussion) could be  taxed as well.<p>If it's the second... then aspartame (or plain water) ought to be favored over sugar/corn_syrup by the tax.

I used to find myself torn between the iPhone and Android, but myTouch with the new OS is very smooth.<p>The multi-tasking is excellent- I was reading a book in FBReader last week and when I opened it yesterday it opened from RAM. With the Dolphin Browser, background tabs actually stay loaded in the background, and sites with auto-refresh actually keep content refreshed. For me, the browsing experience with Dolphin and the multi tasking are hard to beat. Also, the open market has some great advantages (along with disadvantages such as crappy apps), for e.g. MortPlayer (which was a great mp3/audiobook player for windows mobile) was recently released for Android without any fear of replicating functionality.<p>Like a lot of others, I'm glad for the iPhone vs Android war.

It's also something that you hope will be invisible and will ""just work"" when you're there... you want it to be friendly, respectful, and efficient.<p>I would say that if HR appears from the outset to be burdened by needless bureaucracy (an aptitude test when you acknowledge the position/department/legislature may not require it) definitely checks the box of reflecting a corporate culture that allows such crud to creep in.<p>I don't go for any positions that:
1) Require me to jump through silly hoops when there is no benefit from anyone to doing so.
2) Bog me down in bureaucracy before I've even begun.
3) Require me to give access to any personal data that they do not have the legal right to ask for.<p>On that last one, I'm talking about social networking credentials, overly invasive background checks that don't relate to the position and so on. I was fine with the Home Office and GCHQ asking questions about my finances, running criminal record checks and contacting friends and family as part of a security vetting process that they have the legal mandate to perform... but I wouldn't be fine with a large company performing such things.",1275994218

Newton had a reputation as somewhat of a petty and vindictive man whose ego clashed with those of his rivals in the scientific and mathematical communities. One of these rivals was Robert Hooke, who had been involved in a long-running fued with Newton over which one had discovered the inverse square law. Although Newton's letter to Hooke appeared courteous on the surface, some historians have concluded that he cleverly employed the phrase ""on the shoulders of giants"" to ridicule Hooke's lack of physical stature and imply that he lacked intellectual stature as well.</i><p><a href=""http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/history/q0162b.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/history/q0162b.shtml</a>",1275994066

I am not saying it never happens, but it's much less common now than it used to be a few decades ago.

The study also found that men outnumbered women in increasing numbers as intelligence levels rise. There were twice as many with IQ scores of 125, a level typical for people with first-class degrees. When scores rose to 155, a level associated with genius, there were 5.5 men for every woman.</i>""<p>But also notes that:<p>""<i>Several subtle points popularized by the Pinker vs. Spelke debate are relevant to the Irwing & Lynn study. First, females benefit significantly from single sex education, but single sex education has little impact upon males. As a consequence, the Irwing & Lynn study can not lay claim to a biological difference in intelligence, unless it restricts itself to women attending all girls schools. Secondly, the process of natural selection leads males of any species to have more variance in most traits. As a result, Stephen Pinker suggests that one should find ""more geniuses and more idiots"" among human males (see Pinker slide 41). As a consequence, any omission of people at the lower end of the IQ spectrum would bias the average male IQ upward, relative to the average female IQ .</i>""",1275993550

Breeding for males is fairly easy so you can have a kid even if your IQ is 60. Child of woman of such low IQ would have much higher probability of dying.<p>Also males having single X chromosome have higher variability in traits influenced by genes on X chromosome as the defect of some gene of X chromosome won't be alleviated by correct gene at the other X (because there is no other X in males).<p>Personally I don't care if all Einsteins and Newtons will be male but since more and more scientific discovery rely on joint venture of tens or hundreds of scientists I really think that you should not pass up on opportunity to encourage half of the population to go into science just because there might be some relevant skewing in right tail of distribution.",1275991975

1413426,comment,1412650,1413397,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Definitely. My bet is that the biggest issue is <i>peer pressure</i> which, honestly, is why I think top down efforts from parents and teachers and governments to boost girl's involvement in STEM are so ineffective. Most of the early development kids do in whatever field, be it sports or science, is driven by a need for approval (so are most other things at school). Unless you have a group of peers that you'd like to emulate and that you want to impress and engage with who are also doing science, you're probably not going to learn science. If the kids that are interested in science are otherwise not interested in anything you like (you like country, they like rock, you like comedies, they like sci-fi), then you're way less likely to end up studying what they do. A possible answer might be to make science clubs for girls, with awesome field-trips and awesome teachers. Physics can lead to, say, kinesiology and dancing, instead of making robots. Biology class can get outside of cell studies and into living animals. Chemistry can lead to molecular gastronomy, the development of organic hairdyes -- these kinds of things. These are the seeds from which the other studies can sprout: unless their planted, girls just won't be engaged.<p>In my research, and my personal experience, girls (in North America at least) shy away from the sciences well before they are in the running to become researchers. There's problems there too, but you hear more about them because the women thus affected have a lot more at stake and a way to make their voice heard -- not because it's a bigger issue. The slip seems to happen in Jr. High/Middle School, right when social pressures start to really mount. You can see this in some of the literature on mathematically precocious youth, especially regarding the disrupted relationship that girls have with mathematics confidence versus skill (with adolescent girls there is almost no, or in fact a negative, correlation, between their mathematical ability and their <i>belief</i> in that ability -- one might suggest this feeds into significantly reduced efforts in acceleration, extra-curricular work, harder courseloads, etc.)",1275991211

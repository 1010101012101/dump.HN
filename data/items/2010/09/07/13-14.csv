I'm 25 now and I have never had much experience with such arcade games in my youth.<p>In my youth, when I started playing computer games (with 8 years or so, don't remember exactly), it was already our own computer (of the whole family; a 486 with 33MHz). But I had the feeling that the games I could play there were much better than what I could play on arcade game machines (which were also not that popular; at least I have never really seen much of them). When I had seen one, I always thought that I could play better games for free at home.<p>Games back then which I played and kept deep into my memories were: Commander Keen 1 - 6, Crime Fighter, Stunts, Sim City 1 / 2000. Well and you probably know the history of games. When I grow older, the PC games developed very fast.<p>Most of my friends handled this very similar. We met somewhere at home and played some of those games together (preferable some which could be played turn based or with split screen). A few years later (when we were around 15 or so), we met and organized small LAN-parties.",1283867146

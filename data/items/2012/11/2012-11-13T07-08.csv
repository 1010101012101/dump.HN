4776937,comment,4775882,4775882,3,0,hoytie,,,"I'm all for teaching CS in high school, but am irked by the claim that ""learning to code is just as important as learning how to read and write."" This is obviously not true if you think about it for two seconds. There isn't a job in the world that doesn't involve communication. Reading and writing is the basis of forming arguments and understanding things -- quantitative or not. The best programmers I've encountered have great mastery of their native language. Educators need to be careful about how they suggest CS should be implemented in HS, and just how much is essential. It could be very effective to integrate CS into a mathematics track, since they reinforce each other so nicely. Computer literacy is so important and is becoming more important -- no argument there -- but even computation itself requires a good grasp of language. Computers can't answer the question of ""why"" for us.<p>They also suggest that computing skills will be required for ""any"" job, which raises some important questions. First of all the claim itself is bs: Yeah, computers will become more and more ubiquitous, but many vocations just don't and shouldn't require computational skill. In many cases it could be a distraction from the core issues of the vocation. I don't care if my therapist, dance instructor, baker, farmer, mother, coach, musician, ... (ad infinitum) knows how to reverse a linked list. Sure, computer literacy would help all of them achieve certain things, but let's be honest about what level of CS education is _essential_. Secondly, a world where EVERYONE has a job where computing is of central importance is one I personally would never strive towards. We should ask ourselves if we really want to stick all of society behind a computer.",1352792894

More bidders on the floor drive competition and maximize the closing price.<p>2) Allows others to feel the item is undervalued, and hence provides an opportunity for positive comment.

It's pretty self-explanatory, and some interesting ones are platform-neutral, whereas others you have to specify the CPU manufacturer's hex-code. (See Intel manual, for example.)<p>- For pipelining and HW/CPU details, I suggest you grab a copy of Hennesy and Patterson's Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach. There is also Computer Architecture: A Programmer's Perspective, which is good, but I think for what you're interested in, CAAQA is the better book.<p>- If you just want to play around with HW performance counters, you might want to try Intel's vtune, which comes (or at least did so, two years ago) as an Eclipse plugin/RCP-workbench.",1352791632

1128717,comment,1126878,1127245,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, I think you would actually see more idealistic innovation in schools, especially those considered mid-tier in prestige, if they felt they could get away with it. As it stands now, schools below the top-tier are spending all their time worried that their grads won't be able to get jobs anywhere, so don't feel they can take any chances on something that would seem experimental and crazy. There's a <i>lot</i> of defensiveness and worry about seeming wacky or non-mainstream.",1266321311

Once you consider the fact that for most of human history, we were part of small tribes of close genetic relatives (so kin altruism was good for our tribe's genes, which we are likely to share), you have an explanation that fits the data and makes sense.<p>If that weren't true, you'd have some data that don't make sense, and an evolutionary hole to fill (how would the non-prejudiced tribes outcompete the prejudiced ones before the invention of trade?).",1266321171

It's just that this company and this article in particular gives me the impression, that they dont give two shits about privacy and just do it because the last few times they tried to cross the line they got caught.  I'm not expecting them to be nice, no company is, but they should at least try to show some respect for our privacy - and checking whether I'm happy or not is not doing that.",1266321160

The best way to decide such things is to talk to someone you know who has already lived here.<p>And we don't quite have  our ""Silicon Valley"" yet, though Bangalore has many outsourcing companies and offshore development centres where large companies in the USA or Europe offload work no one there wants to do.

It's quite possible to make money in lots of ways, some of which also create wealth for other people, some of which are relatively neutral for other people, and some of which take it away from other people. I'm not aware of any general formula for determining which is which, except perhaps in the extremes (obviously, various kinds of scam artists fall into the 3rd category).",1266319559

Trying to aquire <i>an excess</i> amount of money is a form of chasing wealth yes (which the author is mainly addressing). But to say that spending Time making money is somehow not an ideal trade off is pretty nonsensical. Surviving is pretty important. And thus having food, water, clothing, and shelter is pretty important. Should we all grow and prepare our own food? Sew our own clothes? Build our own houses? Society as we know it has made survival, in its raw sense, pretty trivial, so long as we align ourselves (more or less) within the system. I don't see how that's necessarily a detrimental or even less-effective/efficient/optimal use of ones life, regardless of whether or not <i>how</i> you make your money is ""truly one's calling"".<p><i>""If your calling in life is to be a musician, what are you doing wasting your life as a store clerk?

It's cheaper, lighter, faster in a straight line, faster around the corners, and better for the environment.<p>Did I also mention I could drive it from San Jose to San Francisco and back without needing a tow truck or an overnight recharge?<p>Did they do anything to advance technology to build it?  Probably not.  But they sure made damn good use of existing technology, and in doing so have produced something truly amazing to drive.<p>In the same vein, have the retro CPU hackers 'advanced' existing technology?  No.  But they've given themselves a really deep knowledge of how CPUs work, and on top of that, added a rather impressive bullet point to their resumes.

1128680,comment,1128014,1128335,0,0,_delirium,,,"Until recently, I hadn't actually heard that definition of startup, at least outside of VCs talking to each other (because obviously VCs only care about the subset of startups that involve VCs and, ideally, large-multiplier exits). But in general I've thought of a ""startup"" as simply a new business based on technology. Some <i>subset</i> of startups were funded by venture capitalists, and a subset were aiming to grow huge and have quick exits. But others aimed at medium-sized businesses, or even smallish businesses. A large proportion of the people I know who've founded startups actively <i>don't</i> want an ""exit"", because they built it, and they aren't going to give it up anytime soon.<p>I'm not even really sure how it became that people assumed that startups ought to aim for large funding and under-5-year exits. Is that just a legacy of the fact that anyone with eyeballs could (and therefore, often did) get funding in the first bubble, so it just became assumed that it was the norm?",1266318093

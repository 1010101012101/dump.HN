Yet despite it being closed source, Microsoft, utterly unsupported, yadda yadda, it works fine. In 20 years, will I be able to have my own completely independent Google Docs running on a Unix that doesn't exist yet, in a datacentre operated by a company that doesn't exist yet, and have all my old docs still there?<p>Basically, I don't think this has been very thought through.",1247212790

My name is very much unpronounceable let alone memorable for most people in the world so I made up a new short version of it, Tad Chef. My actual name is Tadeusz Szewczyk.<p>Your nick name is a good example: ""niyazpk"" is very difficult to memorize. It sounds like a ""no yes pic"".

I realize it does self-regulate to some extent, but there's always a new generation of young people coming in to take their lumps.<p>All that said, as an individual you need to look out for yourself.

It's still a ""bonus"" in effect, but it's a shared bonus if done right with no per-person computation and thus no individual component to cause people to distort their behavior or worry about unfairness.  On the other hand, it can still easily become an expected thing.  On the other other hand, it seems like a reasonable way to reward people for helping create a successful company.  I've read writeups of studies around bonuses, but they're always around much more targeted per-individual bonuses instead of something approximating a profit share approach.",1247210776

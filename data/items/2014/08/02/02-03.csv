8123859,comment,8114879,8123816,2,0,cgio,,,"Unfortunately, and as I share in my other post I have some experience in this, a parent&#x27;s consideration of &quot;normal&quot; is not enough. One of the most poignant moments is when a child&#x27;s behaviour is made fun of in a social environment like the playground. When this happens as you observe your child trying to build the first primal social bridges, you feel a little trapped, as there is no party at fault on this exchange. Children can be brutal, but this is part of their childness.<p>As an Asperger&#x27;s myself, I have clear memories of trying to add curves to my movements to make them more normal, because I observed someone dancing badly. It was around the same age, so I guess it could be a developmental aspect in regions of the spectrum and not so much due to the specific reason assigned.",1406948307

8123857,comment,8104365,8104583,1,0,rich2892,,,"ycombinator: Pitch<p>Hi, I see you guys are interested in making an MMORPG language learning game. It&#x27;s a great idea. In fact, it&#x27;s an idea that my brother, myself and a few other guys have been working on the past four years, ever since I graduated from Ohio State with my Master&#x27;s in Foreign Language Education. We have already seen it work in our very alpha, alpha testing of some rough prototypes with high school Spanish students in our area.<p>To test the concept, we focused on just a few language concepts (teaching personal, descriptive adjective pairs, e.g. &quot;tall/short; old/young&quot;, etc.) and set up an ambush scenario of the player by some orcs fitting the description. Then, we paired the player with a helper avatar. The avatar and the player each shot a different orc in every attacking pair. The avatar told the player which to target.<p>Second, we set up a castle maze, through which the player has to navigate as a spy, picking up needed ingredients for a weaponized spell along the way. The avatar helper already knows the lay of the castle. He instructs the player where he has to go to avoid detection.<p>We tested these two and a third game in a few area high schools last spring just before school let out. The response was overwhelmingly positive. The kids dubbed our one game the &quot;Spanish flappy bird&quot;, because of how addictive it was.<p>While we&#x27;d like to develop more apps, eventually putting together an entire year&#x27;s worth of curriculum for teachers, we need to redirect our focus to building an extensible framework and community to step up the development from what only a handful of people could otherwise produce.<p>I&#x27;m a teacher. I know state standards, which do work. I also know that a lot of the textbooks, etc. we use in schools to teach are not effective and, quite frankly, boring. Standards are good for accountability. Games are good for engagement.<p>So we&#x27;re linking the two.  We are building a framework which tracks a language learner&#x27;s (not just high school; anyone&#x27;s) progress through a given game and determines where he is in mastering all of the standards and, by extension, the language. The framework plots out his game experience, directing him to this or that &quot;mission&quot;/app targeting the concomitant standard based on his strengths and weaknesses.<p>The framework itself is open-sourced and built by a community of developers. This is where we need your help. Once it&#x27;s fully operational, we open up the game development to both for and not-for-profit groups who are willing to create their games in accordance with state standards. That way our framework acts as a kind of clearinghouse. Teachers and the general public know that what is published in our community actually educates in addition to entertaining. Developers can work on a project as small-scale as just a particular vocabulary set or grammar concept. Or they can go whole hog and make a full-scale, MMORPG for an entire, say, year&#x27;s worth of language instruction. Or anywhere in between. What unifies them is a common set of standards and a common performance database so that users, regardless of where they start or what they do, know a.) where they are in acquiring the language and b.) what games/missions, etc. will take them to the next level.<p>Another way of thinking about this framework from the user&#x27;s experience is like Marvel&#x27;s comics universe of characters and worlds.<p>We would like to kick this off with a forum and see where to go from there, who wants to develop what.

Assuming he&#x27;s using a tourism visa like most would be doing in this position, he&#x27;s breaking the law but this kind of activity is nothing but beneficial to the foreign country, since he is spending money in the local economy, not competing in the local labor market and not drawing any welfare benefits.",1406945957

It was the ultimate joy, this rush in your entire body, and you can’t contain it. That went away when my sister started teasing me and I realized flapping wasn’t really acceptable.</i><p>I have a son that &quot;flaps&quot; and we have been concerned about autism for about a year and a half now, since he turned two.  He has <i>some</i> autism signs, but our developmental ped says not the <i>classic</i> signs.  He can do eye contact, he is social, but he didn&#x27;t speak, he did have the &quot;daydream gaze.&quot;<p>We&#x27;ve been doing speech therapy now since he turned 2 and we&#x27;ve added an additional speech therapist since he turned 3.  His progress has been remarkable, I can have a real conversation with him sometimes (granted, I have to infer a lot, but it&#x27;s huge from where he was!).  He has issues &quot;taking turns&quot;, waiting in lines for camel rides at the zoo or getting on the carousel is really hard for him.<p>So, the flapping thing.  My kid is <i>great</i>!  I love him as he is!  I want the best for him, I want him to be as &quot;normal&quot; as possible.  But if he says what this kid says, that he was happier flapping, then I really hope he doesn&#x27;t lose that.  I love him as he is and I want nothing more for him than to be happy.  We are extremely fortunate that he&#x27;s not been diagnosed with debilitating autism and might have what&#x27;s known as sensory perception disorder instead.  But in the end, it doesn&#x27;t matter, he&#x27;s a great kid and he&#x27;s happy and I want to keep it that way.",1406945643

I can&#x27;t help but feel that the people who make that claim misunderstand the fundamentals of information security.<p>You only have to look at password handling procedures to see recent examples of things once thought hacker-proof that are no longer. MD5 used to be widely used for hashing passwords but it is now considered cryptographically weak and there are many more examples like it throughout the industry. Most (all?) of these hacker-proof like things tend to be based on computational infeasibility or perfect implementation of certain features. In this case, the protocol seems to rely heavily on two things:<p>- self-destructing database records - Self destructing data is a hard problem that is more likely to be solved using a time-based destruction rather than a read-based destruction (how can you ensure with 100% atomicity that the data will be 100% deleted when it is read?). A good example of a time-based self-destruction is Vanish [1].<p>- dynamic procedure that is not accessible from memory - The CPU cannot communicate directly with anything but memory/internal caches [2] so the only way I can think that you&#x27;d solve this is by having a custom piece of hardware that does all the computation internally and only returns the result. This is also not an easy problem as it introduces hardware level complexities.<p>I understand that the author may have just been trying to make it sound more interesting but there are better words that don&#x27;t leave such a bad taste in the readers mouth (&quot;Secure&quot; is a very commonly used one for example). This is especially important when trying to be taken seriously by the security community who are the most likely to take an irrational dislike to something claiming to be hacker-proof.<p>[1] <a href=""http://vanish.cs.washington.edu/pubs/usenixsec09-geambasu.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vanish.cs.washington.edu/pubs/usenixsec09-geambasu.pd...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wpcontent.answcdn.com/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Motherboard_diagram.svg/600px-Motherboard_diagram.svg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wpcontent.answcdn.com/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Mo...</a>",1406945387

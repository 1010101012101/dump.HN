It is pretty difficult to shop for medical care in the event of an emergency, so my tool gives nearby, regional, and national prices for selected procedures so that the patient go into price negotiations with their care provider and hopefully get charged a lower price.<p>Edit: I also made a visualization of the CMS Provider Charge Data here: <a href=\"http://labs.coseppi.com/cms/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://labs.coseppi.com/cms/</a>",1386514784

I was trying to give the essence of what it does in a single sentence.<p>The USD is not literally backed by gold, but part of the Federal Reserve&#x27;s mission is to moderate the rate of inflation; that means holding the value of the USD steady. And the way they do it is beyond the scope of this discussion, but it <i>certainly</i> depends on the Federal Reserve  trading its holdings on the market (which, as you point out, is mainly debt (in terms of USD), not gold).",1386514715

It had huge consequences. Users within the French administration lost their ability to securely communicate with Google and who knows what other sites. Additionally, the overall network security was hit by another blow against the SSL trust infrastructure.<p>This is a seriously bad issue and downplaying hopefully won&#x27;t do them any good. &quot;We only spied in a very sneaky way on our employees, undermining the trust given us by all browser and OS vendors. Don&#x27;t worry. Nothing to see here. Too bad we got caught - if we hadn&#x27;t, we&#x27;d just continue&quot;.<p>By having their root accepted into the browsers stores, they took on a huge responsibility which they have now betrayed and IMHO it doesn&#x27;t matter whether that was the root or one of their intermediates: if they can&#x27;t control them, they never should have issued these intermediate certificates.<p>Browser vendors need to set an example and do a Diginotar here: remove that root from the stores.

6869825,comment,6864539,6868535,2,0,weland,,,"> In both teaching/coursework and research, academia is extremely detail-obsessed, constantly burrowing away from larger, important questions towards small, easily-answerable ones.<p>In the research circles, this is simply because smaller, easily-answerable questions are the ones that fit the short-term grant applications. It&#x27;s very unfortunate, indeed.<p>In the teaching circles, there is a slightly related case, which manifests through this:<p>> For a good example, look at how many different kinds of differential equations the average engineering major at a really good university is required to learn to solve, and then check how often they actually solve those equations in either original research or in their jobs.<p>This is because the mathematics courses need to reach a compromise between teaching enough fundamentals to be meaningful as math courses, and enough &quot;practical&quot; applications to warrant their presence in an engineering curricula.<p>I was also annoyed by taking math courses for three. Fucking. Semesters. But looking back to it, while I have forgotten much of the actual details they taught me, the type of reasoning they taught me stuck with me, and it&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a better way to teach that.<p>> Oh God. You just described my life last year.<p>I hope it gets better. Cheers!",1386514617

One thing I would add is that we <i>could</i> optimize the performance problem by peeling one iteration off the front of the loop, thereby making the rest of the loop type-stable. However, this exposes another problem with this code – the return type of the function depends on the value of n: for n ≤ 0 it returns an Int, while for n > 0 it returns a Float64. Thus, even though we could make <i>this</i> code run faster, any code calling this function would have to code with its poor type behavior in turn.",1386514483

6869807,comment,6869497,6869497,5,0,dredmorbius,,,"A number of things stood out to me in this piece.<p>First was the fact of confession bias:  even if unconsciously, once we&#x27;ve heard a confession, we tend to discount information which would contradict it.  I&#x27;ve seen a similar general trend:  if someone tells us something we tend to believe them, reality notwithstanding.  People pay attention to words.<p>There&#x27;s the PEACE model for ferreting out truth and falsehoods, which dismisses many of the &quot;physical indicators of lying&quot; notions:<p><i>That model is: Lying and anxiety have nothing to do with each other, and lying and body language have nothing to do with each other. However, lying creates a cognitive load, and the more you lie, the more elements you have to juggle, and if you keep going back and asking for more and more details, eventually that system breaks down. ... What the PEACE technique helps you do is find out which part of the story is verifiable and which part isn&#x27;t.</i><p>I&#x27;ve found that cues of coherence and specificity in stories are helpful to me in assessing the veracity of both personal interactions and of academic / topical research.<p>In the interview, Douglas Starr also mentions the case of people who&#x27;ve appeared on TV or in public making appeals to find the perpetrator of crimes for which they were later convicted on evidence (and by all appearances accurately) -- the displays of emotion these people present don&#x27;t show any of the physical signs of lying that the Reid method is based on.<p>And finally, the behavioral tricks employed by investigators and by which subjects operate which tend to result in false confessions are telling.  The pressure to confess, and the sense of the subject that confessing will somehow make things better (it almost always doesn&#x27;t) are both psychological traps which tend to produce a false result.<p>Even in areas far removed from law enforcement or interrogation, I see valuable lessons here.",1386514265

Currency represents an agreement as well as a quantitative value. The ten pound note currently in my wallet is a liability that the Bank of England owes to me when demanded.

I argue against what I feel are good ideas and argue for what are seemingly not so good ideas. As long as you don&#x27;t get too far off track the discussion is often very enlightening about what your customers actually want to build. The downside is that you either end up feeling like or looking like an idiot because you&#x27;re seemingly on the wrong side of idea (BTW I&#x27;m not claiming that I&#x27;m not an idiot). Letting everyone know that this is your approach doesn&#x27;t have much, if any, downside and alleviates this problem. Having another person to tag team with makes it less exhausting.

I believe that it is not.<p>Technically, yes, if people all decide the currency has value, then it will have value. But this is a ridiculous argument! How much is this currency supposed to be worth? According to this argument, any number is potentially valid! This means that there is absolutely nothing that should hold the value of the currency fixed, and with a few &quot;no free lunch&quot; arguments (anyone can claim any random thing has value and try to trade with it), we see that things with no intrinsic value should NOT have value.<p>So why does the US Dollar have value? It&#x27;s just paper (cotton), right? Not true! If the exchange rate of the dollar decreases, you&#x27;ll see the Federal Reserve will start trading some of its goodies from Fort Knox (gold, etc.) for US Dollars, in order to maintain the dollar&#x27;s exchange rate/value.<p>So in reality, the US Dollar is <i>backed</i> by holdings that have intrinsic value.<p>EDIT: As pointed out, I should mention that another important backing of the USD is taxation.<p>Also, what I said about the Federal Reserve isn&#x27;t technically true. What&#x27;s important is that they have a mission to moderate the rate of inflation of the USD (i.e., maintain its value), and their asset holdings are critical in allowing them to do this.",1386512258

Quite a few of the old lifters were damaged goods; because their OT told them to start lifting or get used to being permanently bedridden in the future; they were damaged goods before they started not because of lifting which was medically therapeutic.<p>So ... doing something stupid has a higher cost for older folks.

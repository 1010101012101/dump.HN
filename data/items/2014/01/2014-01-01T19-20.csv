Kitchen units will be devised that will prepare ‘automeals,’ heating water and converting it to coffee; toasting bread; frying, poaching or scrambling eggs, grilling bacon, and so on. Breakfasts will be ‘ordered’ the night before to be ready by a specified hour the next morning.”<p>“Communications will become sight-sound and you will see as well as hear the person you telephone. The screen can be used not only to see the people you call but also for studying documents and photographs and reading passages from books. Synchronous satellites, hovering in space will make it possible for you to direct-dial any spot on earth, including the weather stations in Antarctica.”<p>“[M]en will continue to withdraw from nature in order to create an environment that will suit them better. By 2014, electroluminescent panels will be in common use. Ceilings and walls will glow softly, and in a variety of colors that will change at the touch of a push button.”\n“Robots will neither be common nor very good in 2014, but they will be in existence.”<p>“The appliances of 2014 will have no electric cords, of course, for they will be powered by long- lived batteries running on radioisotopes.”<p>“[H]ighways … in the more advanced sections of the world will have passed their peak in 2014; there will be increasing emphasis on transportation that makes the least possible contact with the surface. There will be aircraft, of course, but even ground travel will increasingly take to the air a foot or two off the ground.”<p>“[V]ehicles with ‘Robot-brains’ … can be set for particular destinations … that will then proceed there without interference by the slow reflexes of a human driver.”<p>“[W]all screens will have replaced the ordinary set; but transparent cubes will be making their appearance in which three-dimensional viewing will be possible.”<p>“[T]he world population will be 6,500,000,000 and the population of the United States will be 350,000,000.” And later he warns that if the population growth continues unchecked, “All earth will be a single choked Manhattan by A.D. 2450 and society will collapse long before that!” As a result, “There will, therefore, be a worldwide propaganda drive in favor of birth control by rational and humane methods and, by 2014, it will undoubtedly have taken serious effect.” [See our Walt Disney Family Planning cartoon from earlier this week.]<p>“Ordinary agriculture will keep up with great difficulty and there will be ‘farms’ turning to the more efficient micro-organisms. Processed yeast and algae products will be available in a variety of flavors.”<p>“The world of A.D. 2014 will have few routine jobs that cannot be done better by some machine than by any human being. Mankind will therefore have become largely a race of machine tenders. Schools will have to be oriented in this direction…. All the high-school students will be taught the fundamentals of computer technology will become proficient in binary arithmetic and will be trained to perfection in the use of the computer languages that will have developed out of those like the contemporary “Fortran.”<p>“[M]ankind will suffer badly from the disease of boredom, a disease spreading more widely each year and growing in intensity. This will have serious mental, emotional and sociological consequences, and I dare say that psychiatry will be far and away the most important medical specialty in 2014.”<p>”[T]he most glorious single word in the vocabulary will have become work!” in our ”a society of enforced leisure.”",1388606311

6996299,comment,6964831,6964831,1,0,gordaco,,,"This misses a very important distinction: low-level against high-level. CLIs, especially *NIX shells, usually offer low-level operations and let you combine them as you please. GUIs, on the other hand, offer higher-level operations, which is to say, prearranged and monolithic combination of low-level features to perform the most common use cases of the software. Thus, the flexibility and the possibilities of the low-level approach are lost, although it definitely results in an easier to use system, since the operations are far closer to the &quot;semantic&quot; level at which a user operates most of the times.<p>This division is exactly what you would expect when there is a division between newbies and advanced users (which the author labels as &quot;programmers&quot;, but they&#x27;re not the same thing), which is exactly what&#x27;s happening. The beginners are happy with a graphical and discoverable UI that helps them learn to use the tool, while the advanced users automatically resort to the CLI because they know that they probably need some tweaking that is probably not covered by the high-level preset functions from the GUI, and/or requires visiting different dialog boxes and it&#x27;s far slower to use.<p>The case about Word versus LaTeX is a perfect example: after I learned to use LaTeX properly, I no longer use Word.<p>All this is very related to the way Linux evolved, initially only for advanced users and slowly gaining GUI functionality to make it nicer for average users.",1388606201

If tommath or any of the others do that, then I don&#x27;t really care that much (for my purpose which is scripting langs that use tommath) about the big num perf.  Faster is better but the high order bit for me, at least, is perf on the smaller numbers.",1388605815

APIs are considered carefully and not introduced into the core unless they solve a major problem, and solve it cleanly and well.<p>What is missing from Clojure, I think, is better support – either at the language level or as common practice – for large software composition, or programming-in-the-large.

I really hope Nick and Ian keep doing these platform studies because there is nothing else like them out there right now. A few things about the Atari 2600 make this book fascinating. It&#x27;s like reading about some weird ancient civilization and how it tried to build nuclear bombs out of sticks and stones.<p>Case in point: The Atari 2600 had no screen buffer. You drew lines on the screen in real time, as the electron gun was firing. As the gun moves, so does your code, immediately rendering whatever is being drawn by the gun. This means everything had to be calculated at the exact moment the electron gun is where you want the tank to be drawn. It all took place through the TIA chip designed by Joe DeCuir and others at Atari.<p>Additionally, drawing the background of the screen was even more difficult, as the Atari 2600 could only address half the screen: you had to mirror whatever background was on one side, onto the other side of the screen, mirrored vertically.<p>But wait, it gets even more complicated! That one side of the screen was composed of 20 columns of possible addressing, making for 40 columns total across the screen. The 20 columns you could address on the left side of the screen were numbered, and I am not making this up, as follows:<p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4<p>That means you addressed the first part of the screen in ascending, left to right. Then, you had to draw right to left in reverse order (though numerically, it was still ascending), then you had 4 more bits to address, left to right.<p>Absolutely nuts. You can actually see the graphics if you look at the assembly of a 2600 game because the graphics were literally dot, no dot. The graphics were stacks of one&#x27;s and zero&#x27;s.

Say for example South Park&#x27;s episodes with Mickey (although more of a Trademark issue than copyright), more on point with copyright is South Park&#x27;s Star Wars episodes.  However, to answer your question, is it possible to make a non-satirical Mickey story that does not violate Disney Trademarks? The answer is yes, but admittedly much more difficult and likely to infringe than a satirical story.<p>>Hackers tend to view any involvement of the courts as a failure.<p>As a lawyer, I see lawsuits as a cost of doing business and inevitable for any successful enterprise.  I would encourage all hackers, especially, to view lawsuits in the same light (e.g. I am not successful until I get sued).  I say this because hackers particularly set out to disrupt established industries, take Uber or AirBnB as good examples, but even YC itself has been sued, that is not a failure that is the cost of success.<p>> At some point, the public deserve to own their own culture, not megalithic corporations.<p>This is simply where we disagree, I am not saying you are wrong by any means, because I do not think their is a right answer, your point is sincere and well reasoned.  My counter, is that the free market decides.  Moreover, if Mickey is not going to win in the market place because society wants to take the character and run with it open source style, well then Mickey will lose in favor of another cartoon Mouse created by an pro open source artist, but I would say the reason Mickey became a cultural icon is because of the tight control of the story and character vis-a-vis Disney ownership/investment.  In contrast and in support of your position Japan has a thriving culture based open source character, where even iconic corporate mascots are adopted by the public and the public creates their own stories, comics, commercial products, virtual concerts, ect...",1388603691

I&#x27;m looking for some interesting work for anywhere from 3 to 6 months--maybe more.<p>I specialize in programming languages: DSLs, static analysis, verification, program synthesis[1] and so on.<p>Admittedly, this is a narrow field, but it&#x27;s also surprisingly broadly applicable: there are many domains where a small domain-specific language can be much more expressive than a standard library; I then know how to build some powerful tools on top of the language including things like bounded verification and all sorts of static checking. DSLs can be used both to help expert programmers or to make a system more accessible to non-programmers. Especially for the latter, we can also design interesting <i>interactive</i> tools that help non-experts express themselves as they go along.<p>I also do a lot of functional programming: primarily Haskell along with OCaml and Racket. If you&#x27;re interested in experimenting with functional programming at your startup, I&#x27;d really love to help. Apart from actually using functional programming, I really enjoy teaching people about it: for example, I&#x27;m in the top 10 for [haskell] on StackOverflow[2] and I&#x27;ve recently been teaching people about type theory at a meetup in SF[3]. I also have a particular interest in functional reactive programming (FRP); over the summer, I even designed an FRP library for OCaml (in the browser--with js_of_ocaml).<p>If any of this sounds interesting, I&#x27;d love to talk to you!

It&#x27;s an exciting field that has really heated up in the last few years thanks to advances in computational power and SMT solvers. I think it&#x27;s about ripe for some practical applications. I&#x27;ve done some research on the subject and implemented a few different synthesizers, so I have a reasonably rare amount of experience with it.<p>Program synthesis also involves verifying the programs we generate. Our approach to &quot;bounded verification&quot; is actually interesting on its own: we can reasonably quickly check conditions against code <i>exhaustively</i>, using an SMT solver. This could be very useful if you need high levels of assurance about your code.<p>[2]: <a href""http://stackoverflow.com/tags/haskell/topuser"" rel""nofollo"">http://stackoverflow.com/tags/haskell/topusers</a><p>[3]: You can see past slides at <a href""http://jelv.is/talk"" rel""nofollo"">http://jelv.is/talks</a>.

So now what?<p>There&#x27;s reforming the system, but we&#x27;ve been reforming the system for decades, and it&#x27;s gotten worse consistently since the 1970s. We elect a professed civil libertarian as President, and he brings the State to unimaginable and exciting new heights of violence against individual liberty.<p>Burn the system to the ground? Okay, sure. But we all know how most revolutions turn out. Which is to say, in the usual and best case they fizzle out, despite the strong emotions of would-be revolutionaries. Worst case scenario: well, look up any revolution, and let me know if you&#x27;ve got a solution beyond &quot;Well I&#x27;m a good guy, I wouldn&#x27;t be like every other revolutionary!&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve settled on something in the space that&#x27;s occupied by ideas about &quot;counterpower&quot; or &quot;dual power&quot; (using a Left-frame) and Konkinite agorism (using a Right-frame). We need to build up alternative institutions to government power to rebuild the civil society. Many institutions--certainly all the major media, corporations, unions, nonprofits, and universities--are so closely integrated in the network of State power that attempts at reforming them are pointless. Instead we should development alternative, parallel structures that we can live and operate in, trying to limit the amount we interact with and serve the government.<p>Doing that, and figuring out how to do that, is the hard part that requires lots work. As technologists, I think we&#x27;re in an ideal position, as the technological frontier is relatively unexplored compared to other ways of doing this. Research decentralized manufacturing: simpler supply chains and homogeneous production facilities means more fault-tolerant production, which means fewer opportunities for the State to exert control. Support open source: software is going to eat the world, and code that anyone can access disperses power from large entities incorporated by the State to anyone who&#x27;s able to use it. Be thoughtful supporters of structures like Bitcoin: despite their flaws, they have the potential to make large portions of the economy illegible to the State.<p>This approach also doesn&#x27;t ask us to relinquish the right to interact with the government if it suits our ends, particularly in legal cases and occasionally electorally.",1388603582

At the POS, I can select between the debit/credit function. I normally use debit for small purchases. It&#x27;s immediately billed from my bank account.<p>Every transaction is authorized by my PIN, that I understand is required to extract the cryptographic authorization from the on-card EMV chip. Since two years, almost every POS now has an EMV reader. If you can&#x27;t remember your PIN, the card still has the magnetic stripe and signature function, but you must show an ID for every purchase.<p>I understand that EMV + PIN systems are now mandated by the credit card issuers in that the retailers are covered by an insurance against fraudulent transactions <i>only</i> if they have an EMV reader. That is, in case a stolen card was used, the retailer will get its money if and only if they had an EMV system and/or asked to see ID if the buyer couldn&#x27;t give a PIN.<p>There&#x27;s also an online database of stolen card numbers against which larger purchases (>150€) must be always validated, and a 24/7 phone service for both reporting stolen cards and checking if a card is stolen. If the retailer can&#x27;t access the database electronically, they must manually call in and validate the card using good-old telephone for those large purchases.",1388603526

There are many people with big ideas and willing to undertake risky endeavors, but there are also many people who vehemently resent &quot;techies.&quot; I think most SF citizens regard &quot;techies&quot; as mildly obnoxious. Overall, I find that SF is relatively tolerant of diversity, /except/ when it comes to people working in STEM disciplines, and so wearing Glass in SF is really asking for trouble.",1416002336

Just look at those same bootcamp programs you mentioned - their graduates may (or may not, actually, now that I look at the stats) have a lower employment rate than coders from a good university, but the job prospects are still by today&#x27;s standards very good, and when they do get jobs they&#x27;re still pulling down comfortably upper-middle-class incomes.<p>Convicted felons would probably find it harder to find a job just because they have to put that fact on their job applications, but they have to deal with that whatever line of work they go into.",1416002098

No other country has such an amazing legal foundation to allow for Liberty; the founding fathers came here <i>exactly</i> because they wanted to move to a place that had a tax system they agree with more. But in the past few generations we&#x27;ve destroyed this.<p>So it&#x27;s not I that have to move somewhere else. I&#x27;ve already moved. I&#x27;ve moved to where there can be Freedom, and where there once was. I&#x27;m here because I believe in Freedom and I think we can get it back, no thanks to people like you that are OK with the erosion of this most Enlightened idea.<p>The real question is, those who don&#x27;t believe in freedom anymore, why don&#x27;t they move to Europe or something? That&#x27;s what Europe has always been, so go there. People came here from Europe so they could be free, and you&#x27;re spoiling it for us. This is a land of immigrants that want to be left alone.

Lower fruits are things that can more easily be decoupled from the scope of the government. ARKYD and similar projects prove there&#x27;s no need for government in sending things to space, plus all the work by Virgin and Space X.

Weather and cargo storage are totally distance-independent.<p>But let&#x27;s take a step back.  We&#x27;re imagining the sort of default rosy driverless-vehicle future, right?  Driverless cars can be made that are fully autonomous, at least as safe as human drivers in essentially all conditions, and not terrifyingly expensive.<p>We agree that in that case the driverless car is strictly more attractive to riders than the drivered-cars of today are, right?  So if the value that a person today puts on having a car is A, and the value that future person puts on having a future car is B, then B > A?  Indeed, B is much greater than A?<p>And we also agree that today, cities are pretty car-oriented?  So A is large ENOUGH that cities pander to it to a large degree?  And there&#x27;s a positive feedback cycle here where when cities pander to cars, that makes cars actually more valuable compared to the competition.<p>Now what you&#x27;re saying is that when we replace A with B, where B >>> A, cities will (eventually) pander to cars less.  Why?<p>The thing that you suggest is that cars waste real estate.  Which, certainly, they do.  I do note in passing that driverless cars might waste less real estate (for example, they could be sent to more distant and more inconvenient parking structures, or the utilization of people / car could go up with a rides-for-hire model).  But whatever, at the very least the real estate efficiency of driverless cars is no worse than the real estate efficiency of regular cars.<p>So meanwhile, today, the rail + maybe something like segway model has value X.  We agree that X < A, right?  That in America at least cars provide more value than transit, and so people get cars, and so cities pander to cars.  Now you seem to be envisioning that in the driverless future, rail + segways have value Y, and Y is not only > X, it&#x27;s also > A, and in fact > B.  Why?  What is it about driverless segways that is so great?  Unlike driverless cars, they don&#x27;t seem like they provide much value for their users (you aren&#x27;t going to read a book while your driverless segway takes you to your destination, and though maybe they&#x27;d be a little better when drunk).<p>And, further, we&#x27;re saying that driverless segways are that awesome even if they have to reverse some inertia of cities currently being designed kind of &quot;against&quot; them, and indeed, even if they have to reverse yet more inertia because the FIRST thing that happens in our driverless future is people buy driverless cars and become a constituency for even more city-pandering-to-cars.<p>I don&#x27;t see it.  Maybe if it takes a long time to get to driverless cars, because right now I think that the car domination of the world is getting a bit milder.  Maybe if the current trend continues for a few decades, and then cities have become more hostile to cars, driverless or otherwise, the increased value of cars won&#x27;t be enough that it will get over the inertia.<p>But if we get good driverless cars in the next decade or fifteen years?  In-city rail is just going to die in almost all cities.  And once it&#x27;s dead, it will be dead for a long, long time.",1416001208

The best solution in this case is to either install binary packages via selecting FTP as your source or (better) via ports. Also, I generally avoid installing extra software outside the base packages until after the system is installed, as this was a problem that could crop up when installing earlier versions (not really a <i>problem per se</i> as much as if it&#x27;s something you weren&#x27;t familiar with, it may do unexpected things).<p>If you install some of the tools in ports-mgmt (portupgrade, for instance, which includes portinstall), you can make the ports collection far easier to manage and use, and it might be more approachable for new users. Not that it&#x27;s difficult to do a make && make install from the port you want.<p>I haven&#x27;t touched FreeBSD in years, so I&#x27;d imagine the installer is a bit more forgiving now. That said, my experience with the ports collection was what lead me to select Gentoo for my Linux preferences (later, and more presently, Arch). But, I have <i>very</i> fond memories of using ports, and I think everyone has their preferred methods. The trick is to neither give in or give up and play around with it until you&#x27;re familiar and have picked tools you&#x27;re comfortable with (this holds true for almost anything)! I&#x27;d suggest giving it another shot.<p>Edit: I lied. Apparently I have a FreeBSD 10 vm, so it hasn&#x27;t been years.

This does the &quot;git add --patch&quot; and &quot;git commit&quot; in one step, so you never see any index.<p>Face it, the git index is an exaust manifold bolted on to a bicycle. This can be proven. Any argument you make for how the git index is useful is easily knocked down with a counterargument which shows how it it is redundant, because existing mechanisms uniformly handle that case.<p>Moreover, the index can be shown to complicate git. For instance when viewing differences with &quot;git diff&quot; you have: index to working (&quot;git diff&quot;), HEAD to index (&quot;git diff --cached&quot;) or HEAD to working (&quot;git diff HEAD&quot;).  This cruft all goes away if there is no index: you can just have &quot;git diff&quot; for the usual case of &quot;show me what&#x27;s different between the branch and working copy&quot;, like in virtually every other revision control system on the planet.<p>> <i>I think if people are taught git focusing on the index/staging area, it makes a lot more sense and you have much fewer problems.</i><p>Absolutely no disagreement there. The index <i>is</i> there (complaining won&#x27;t make it go away), and you have to know about it, otherwise you will not understand what is going on in some situations.

For instance, compiled arithmetic that is heavy on large bignums will probably not be much faster than its interpreted version, because cycles are actually spent in processing the arrays of bignum digits (or &quot;limbs&quot;), which is done in some bignum library code.  The code being compiled looks innocuous; it just has formulas like (a+b)*c, but these turn into bignum library calls. Since the bignum library is written in C and compiled, the calls run equally fast whether called by interpreted or compiled code.

The answer to that, for example, is of course not--as the Python folks are finding out (or celebrating, depending on how you feel about that way of thinking).<p>The problem is that the vast majority of languages have some features that you don&#x27;t use, and even if others use them then things still generally work out okay--you can hide it away.<p>C++, via operator overloading, exceptions, <i>backwards compatibility with C and its problems</i>, templates, function overloading, and all manner of other things, is simply too large to be trusted. I assert that it is <i>so difficult as to be practically impossible</i> to ensure that, if you rely on third-party code outside of your direct control or the language spec, you are writing safe, performant, bug-free, and maintainable C++ code. C is magnitudes simpler, and people <i>still</i> manage to fuck that up.<p>Everyone bandies about the performance of C++ and the whole only-pay-for-what-you-use aspects of it, but in the fast majority of cases that&#x27;s simply not important from a business or project standpoint. If you&#x27;re writing numerical code, for example, why not just use the hyper-optimized compilers available for Fortran? If you&#x27;re writing tight embedded control code, why not just use assembly?<p>Sure, I&#x27;ve had a friend that worked on the CMS at Cern and they used some unholy pile of C++ dating back 20 years and that worked well. I&#x27;ve known a bunch of people doing bioinformatics and they all write/copy/paste shitty C++ and get faster results than their semi-legible Python or MATLAB.<p>That said, all of those use cases are academic, which is maybe the last place where performance even matters (arguable in and of itself). You might claim &quot;but but but games!&quot; and then you&#x27;d be wrong <i>again</i>, because a great number of games are written using super-slow scripting engines and terrible C++ codebases. Mike Acton, giving a talk at a conference this year, pointed out that there was no compelling reason to use C++ over C because the OOP features fall on their face in a high-performance environment.<p>It&#x27;s just a bad language. It was useful once, it&#x27;s occasionally useful now (if you must, which you usually don&#x27;t), but we really should just move on to new things.<p>Its OOP features are poorly thought-out, its performance with the standard library is pretty bad without modification for certain use cases, its learning curve is absurd, its growth is unbounded. Just let the thing die.<p>To answer your question about rewriting things:<p>We did write a lot of things from scratch, and spent years battle-hardening them, because we didn&#x27;t want to deal with the (at that time horrid) development overhead and philosophical issues of Boost. STL was fine until it wasn&#x27;t due to some cross-platform issues. QT/POCO are cool in their own right, but didn&#x27;t match our use case.",1415999020

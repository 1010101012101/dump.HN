If you can prove that your program works in the required way, then your proof holds.<p>However, brute force solutions are ugly and shed little (if any) new light on the problem, and in the words of G.H.Hardy - ""There is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics"". With things like this I just can't help but think that an elegant and enlightening proof will unexpectedly pop up some time in the distant future when we're all off researching some sort of new-age hypermaths or something...<p>... well, I suppose a man's got to dream, right?",1245891454

I think those discharge fairly quickly in modern systems but I am not sure.<p>The outputs of the system are fairly innocuous because they are DC at a low enough voltage (max of 12VDC) to not seriously hurt you even if you touch both the positive and the negative of one of the connectors. Now if there was some sort of anomaly and the dc lines were carrying a waveform, then if the wave was a specific frequency to match your body's impedance it could actually affect you.

Wiles' proof was relatively lengthy and involved, but it can be examined and studied by humans in an extremely reasonable amount of time. It only took three days for Wiles to present his original proof. There aren't many people in the world who can understand it, and there are fewer who are knowledgeable enough to confirm its validity, but they exist.<p>Conversely, the proof described in the NYTimes article is of such length that no single mathematician could confirm its validity -- rather than deducing the non-existence of the object in question by a logical argument, it examined a huge number of possible cases. In that respect, it is far more similar to the proof of the four color map theorem. The issue is not so much whether or not we trust the computer's result, but moreso what it means for mathematics to proceed with results that we do not, in a traditional sense, understand.",1245890786

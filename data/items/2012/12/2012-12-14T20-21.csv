Individual customer demographic data should be absolutely secret, but that doesn't just mean that marketing people shouldn't upload it to Dropbox so it's easier to pull into their abominable Access DB. That means that the only people who <i>ever</i> see it are CSRs while they're actually talking to the customer. Then IT can add value by isolating CSR desktops on their own 802.1X-secured wired network, while providing a more open network for their other work, and encouraging a shred-all-post-it-notes policy.<p>I think IT can make legitimate security arguments, but these can't start with ""gosh Dropbox is terrible!""

That can be because the driver slightly errs in seeing the slope or gas, or because of other sources of error (gusts of wind, maybe).  Without that variation, you're right, the system is unidentified.  The larger the variation, the better the identification.  But none of this is news to economists, and none fundamentally requires the econometrician to have better information than the driver (although measurement error can matter in some circumstances, it matters in a different way).<p>As I'm sure you know, these arguments (i.e. mainstream Economics is wrong and ignorant!) are more convincing when they're accompanied by a model.  DSGE models have a lot of limitations, but they're pretty good for demonstrating failure of identification.  Monetary policy is tricky to identify, and I'd be sympathetic to an argument showing that deviations from a Taylor-rule are bad for identifying the effects of monetary policy shocks (lots of people would agree with this, the interesting question is whether they're bad in empirically important ways or just conceptually bad) but your car+driver analogy seems like it's aiming to be broader than that.",1355518016

The advantage would be to start with a program about which you can make strong claims, and then break apply transformations that invalidate those claims, replacing them with weaker claims in a predictable, methodical fashion.<p>Languages like C allow programmers to easily write programs that are hard to reason about mechanically, and the programmer can use that power to hand-tune the program to be very fast. The programmer can also use that power to crank out fragile programs without thinking through all of the edge cases. An ideal compiler working on pure functions could say ""No, listen, write this so I can understand it, and then I'll start using shortcuts to make it run quick"".<p>Of course, even if your compiler is smart enough to actually beat competent hand-optimization, there are some negative side effects. If you have optimized a program by hand, you know what properties your optimizations rely on, and so you'll know when a new feature requires that code to be rewritten at a performance cost. You can take that cost into account making the decision about adding that feature.<p>But if the optimization is done automatically without your involvement, you'll just see a sudden performance hit when you add a feature, and figuring out why will involve arcane knowledge of compiler internals.",1355517950

They are not, shifting the storage elsewere not only opens up another access point publicly to potentual get at your data but the over comfortable attitude it installs will be inclined to make the clients not as secure as they should be.<p>If I was a Administrator and I was responsible for the data and liable to getting legaly shafted if there is a breach and the company used clouds and had a BYOD policy then I'd be very much underpaid and with that googling for some form of disclaimer you got every user to sign and every manager to sign.  Just so I could sleep at night.<p>Remember this, when it comes to IT most users are like children and with that they will find a way to break it if one exists and failing that they will find a way.<p>Block everything website wise and add as an exception, as there realy isn't many websites that companies need you to access.

I have to try to be very sensitive here.<p>There was a certain ethnic group who overwhelmingly aced calculus tests.  I mean, they were machines.  Got it done faster than everyone and just aced the tests.  No contest.<p>The amazing thing was what happened in Physics class, both tests and labs.  They were completely lost.  It was really an odd and unbelievable thing to behold.  Some of them would get tripped-up by the simplest things.<p>I won't venture to guess as to why and how this happens.  I'll just say that, in my experience, mechanical memorization of anything isn't learning at all.  It's just memorization with no value whatsoever beyond that.<p>I am trying to think about a CS example.<p>Let's say that someone memorizes the implementation of a binary GA algorithm or a NN.  Great.  They can type it out in an instant when asked.  Do they really understand what's going on? Do they understand when to apply it, how and why?  Do they understand how to optimize it?  Do they know how to make good chromosome encoding decisions? Or how about dealing with cases where the GA is lost looking for a solution?  Do they know how to fix it?  Or how to deal with it?<p>Or how about the choice between writing a class with a bunch of methods and properties vs. a simple routine with lookup table to solve a problem?  I've seen people who think that every solution requires a class and a bunch of objects.  You end-up with code that is fifty times slower and ten times larger than it needs to be.<p>Some of this only comes from experience, of course.  If available, I like to look at code that the candidate wrote and explore it.  It's hard for someone to bullshit you if it isn't their code.  Another interesting thing to do is to put code in front of them and see how they go about understanding what's going on.  After all, if you are hiring them to plug into an existing project that is precisely what they'll have to do.  Someone who can't code will not ask intelligent questions about the code they are looking at.  They will have a hard time getting into it and understanding what's going on.<p>Now, I do understand from other posts that there seems to be a failure in the system in that schools are graduating people who can't write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100.  I can't figure out how someone can come out of a reputable university with a CS degree and not be able to write that program, but that's besides the point.  If this is true, then, well, I hate to say this, puzzle testing may be a necessary evil.  The problem is that this isn't enough because you don't know if you have a memorization machine in front of you or someone who really understands the topic.<p>EDIT:  I should say that I couldn't imagine being a company like Google or similar and trying to hire large numbers of developers on a regular basis.  I would imagine that at that level you don't really have an option but to apply puzzle type filters as a first line of defense.",1355517807

Buying the first Google result isn't how you shop. Instead, you'd `l amazon` to navigate and then search for ""piracetam"" on Amazon.

Are we going with the simplest theory due to Occam's razor?<p><i>The Minimal Standard Model as described above contains the simplest possible model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field. However, it also is possible to have an extended Higgs sector with additional doublets or triplets. The non-minimal Higgs sector favoured by theory are the two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM), which predict the existence of a quintet of scalar particles: two CP-even neutral Higgs bosons h0 and H0, a CP-odd neutral Higgs boson A0, and two charged Higgs particles H. </i><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson#Alternative_models"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson#Alternative_models</a>",1355516053

4922986,comment,4922304,4922927,1,0,w1ntermute,,,"> Look at 9/11 as an example of how a handful of well trained and highly motivated individuals armed with only box cutters were able to take control of jumbo jets and ram them into buildings and kill thousands.<p>Actually, I see 9/11 as an example of TLAs refusing to share information when doing that could have easily stopped the hijackers long before they could do anything. I also see it as something the US brought upon itself with its dependence on oil and constant meddling in the Middle East. So I don't think it's a very good analogy for mass shootings by (usually insane, or at least disturbed) white US citizens.<p>And just because you can't stop all crime doesn't mean you shouldn't stop any crime. There are simple steps that can be taken. For example, the sales of guns at gun shows needs to be stopped immediately. Ex-felons should not be able to get guns. There are a lot of holes in gun control law that could be easily closed if it weren't for people like you making it political suicide for any politician to even suggest that we need stricter gun control laws.<p>> I think that the better solution is to empower responsible individuals to act in their own self-defense and in the defense of others.<p>How would you propose to ""empower"" elementary school children? How about people in a mall or movie theater were the possession of firearms is not allowed?",1355515393

This is going to still be more expensive than building vertex arrays in place, but nowhere near as expensive as copying the whole vertex buffer each time, and possibly even practical.<p>2) Run with the DrawTriangle frame-buffer passing silliness, but let the compiler perform some kind of fusion operation on drawing commands.<p>But yes, ""don't do that"" in anything production until you've been able to make it work well in a toy.

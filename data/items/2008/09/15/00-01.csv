Accepting and appreciating mystery seems to be a real key to unlocking openness and understanding... maybe because reason, as powerful as it is, often fails to capture all of what is meaningful and valuable in life? So many people seem to put 100% of their faith in a form of ""reason"" that is demonstrably incomplete... they think they're being rational by leaving out mystery, but I think it's the opposite.<p>I've learned that if I hold the belief that ""reason is my only god, and I possess it entirely"" I miss out on a huge chunk of what I actually care about. But when I accept that there's a vast swath of important stuff (relating to people and relationships and meaning-of-life in particular) that I currently have no way of adequately describing my thoughts on, or fully understanding, but that I want to experience and discover -- then I seem to be able to live in a much healthier way.",1221440316

It's one of the most frequently mentioned values in this thread, so obviously it's important to people (and to me)... but it can also cause a lack of self-expression or action based on fear of being seen as egotistical.<p>I prefer to avoid the word ""humble"" and instead use ""pretentious"" to describe its lack (pretending to be someone you're not, to know more than you do, or to be more important than those around you), and ""open-minded, eager to listen to criticism and change your mind"" for its positive side.

304188,comment,303642,303847,0,0,h34t,,,"Hmm. How do you draw a line between respect for standing up for morals vs. pragmatic action that drives results?<p>I'm not criticizing the Tiananmen Square students -- I just spent a year in Beijing and I sympathize with their plight as much as you can imagine. But sometimes I think people are too quick to justify any action so long as it is done for honourable/high purposes, even to the point of setting themselves up to lose. For awhile now I've been wrestling with this balance between standing up for rigid moral codes vs. pragmatic getting-things-done. If you make something big and important happen, almost any means can be justified in retrospect. And if you do something with a high moral purpose, almost any pragmatic failure can also be justified in retrospect. What's more acceptable: justifying poor performance as 'honourable loss', or justifying questionable means with 'I made something important happen'?",1221438813

One thing I've seen in my personality -- something I didn't consciously choose to do, but I've observed enough times to know it's a part of me -- is that I am attracted to people who others typically view as intimidating.

304180,story,,,14,10,vlad,"One week since I quit a Fortune 100 IT Job--and I'm loving it",,"I was working on my shareware app for a few years and making great progress.  My dad was laid off from his job in August 2007 after 12 years, and he was very depressed.  I wasn't sure about my financial situation either.  I tried helping him find a job and thought I should get one as well.  (I went to his first interview with him, and they wanted to interview me instead, and kept asking me to come back.)  He's since found a better job than where he was laid off from.  I sure wish I learned Smalltalk for one of those YC Startups that has since been bought, but I think I needed to get a normal, local job to show my family I care (instead of trying to move to California at that time).<p>Now I've quit after working corporate for a year, and I'm loving this decision. :)  I decided to start (and finish) a B.S. in Computer Science degree, possibly even this Spring (as a transfer student with an A.S. in Engineering and Science, Computer Science option), or next Fall, as a double major with Computer Science and Mathematics.  It's been a week since I quit, and two weeks since classes started, and I don't regret it one bit.<p>The other side of the coin, and just as important, is that I want to have some time to make friends with potential future cofounders.  Having cofounders and a completed degree will be awesome.  I am very excited!<p>One of my classes this semester is in the high 400's, which is an independent project in launching one's own mobile app (if not several.)  That is what I wanted to do this fall, anyway!<p>Paul Graham's articles, the last two Startup School events I've had the pleasure to attend, and the posts and people associated with News YC have been awesome motivators.

304178,comment,303642,303658,0,0,h34t,,,"<i>""All of the people I've known that I consider brilliant have also had an amazing amount of humility about what they didn't know, and have been fast to praise the achievements of others.""</i><p>I agree. I think this has something to do with the fact that a ""learning attitude"" is actually <i>necessary</i> to become brilliant in a field. If you haven't jigged your brain up to be really open and accepting to new ideas, you become too rigid quickly fall behind. By admitting what you don't know & praising achievements of others, you're not just doing the people around you a favour by being pleasant, you're also setting yourself up to become smarter.<p>I like how with this particular quality, ""social"" considerations (ie. being liked) overlap strongly with ""mental/learning"" considerations (ie. you become smarter). You win both ways.<p>I've definitely erred on this one too -- misjudged situations and thought they called for too much forcefulness/rigidity. Leadership and openness aren't mutually exclusive, but sometimes people make them out to be (eg/ ""a good leader doesn't change his mind""). Probably because if you are in politics, you frequently have to abandon your intellectual ideals for pragmatic results.<p>(This is the reason why <i>Meditations</i> by Marcus Aurelius is one of my favorite books. He rose to the greatest position of power in the world of his day, without losing his ability to be thoughtful and aware, at least with himself.)",1221438309

Merrill most definitely has a better balance sheet (given the stockholder's equity section) than Lehman, and also less exposure to the types of risky securities that are failing.<p>I for one wouldn't want to be in ownership of any financial in this market.<p>On a side note, money seems to be going through almost a daily rotation of sectors.  One day tech's up while everything else is down, the next day its biotech, commodities etc.. Tomorrow is going to be a down day for financials, which has meant an up day for techs in recent days.

MBA = useless.\nUnless something like finance, where it teaches hard skills, MBAs are pretty much BS.  I have been reading ""Ahead of the Curve"", by one of the Telegraph's editors, that went to HBS to get his MBA.  Very interesting, but at the end the real goal of an MBA is pure greediness, to make the students rich.<p>For many professions, get a master's degree, might mean maybe going to research, and do something good.  Especially in hard sciences.\nFor MBAs the degree is only used to make more  money, the rest doesn't matter.<p>Just a warning, to those people that are hiring, to really be careful to hire somebody with a shiny degree from a top MBA school.",1221438209

At <i>best</i> this would get them a revenue stream along the lines of what Red Hat or Novell sees, which is a solid order of magnitude lower than what Sun was getting during the boom years.  It's noise.  It's like saying that the Zune (at best, an iPod killer) is going to ""save"" Microsoft.<p>I think there's a lot of confusion about my point here.  I'm not saying Sun's products aren't cool.  I'm saying that in the modern world, they aren't going to produce enough revenue to maintain Sun's position in the industry.

My first computer, the ZX spectrum, had video memory that was laid out in such a way that you could only assign two colours to any 8x8 pixel block. However by changing the colours of that square in sync with the TV raster signal, you could get it to display 8 miraculous stripy colours in the same block. You could use a similar technique to get stripes in the theoretically one-colour border.

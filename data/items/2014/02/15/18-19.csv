Psychology isn&#x27;t a science, and scientific Nobel prizes are awarded for scientific breakthroughs. So I looked it up and discovered that the psychologist Kahneman won the Economics Nobel, which makes more sense (economics isn&#x27;t very scientific, but it&#x27;s certainly more scientific than psychology).<p>A quick search reveals that <i>a psychologist has never won a science Nobel for psychological work</i>. As in the above example, the notable work of some psychologists is recognized by awarding a Nobel in a more scientific field, to avoid polluting the Nobel&#x27;s reputation and opening the door to awards in any number of other pseudoscientific fields.",1392490537

It&#x27;s what and where one is working and how much they value their time. I regularly work and study well over 50+ hours per week but not all of it is on my primary job. I also work on personal projects, small side jobs, learning new skills, etc. This whole concept is like the conversation a few years ago about the 5 o&#x27;clock developer. Our profession demands a great deal of time and dedication but that doesn&#x27;t mean you have to subordinate your life to your employer. ---- For the people who think that chaining yourself to working 80+ hours to an employer is good, you need to step back and ask what do you think you&#x27;re going to own after you finally burnout?

7244808,comment,7244551,7244551,12,0,michaelochurch,,,"I&#x27;m not a fan of Paul Graham, but is Y Combinator worth it? Absolutely. It&#x27;d be worth it to give up <i>30</i> percent of your business to get into The Club, much less then 6-10% YC reportedly takes.<p>Y Combinator is a brilliant idea. Paul Graham was something that would be a rarity now, and probably always has been-- a smart, good, straight-shooter who made it big. That made him a really attractive personality, especially to the young, and the fact that he&#x27;s a good writer didn&#x27;t hurt either.<p>YC enabled him to turn that reputation into gold: because the benefit of a startup being YC-approved turned out to be so vast, he can get an early percentage at a low valuation. To be clear about it, his startups benefit as much as he does. He&#x27;s not screwing them over in any way.<p>This is probably why I have to deal with the rankban/slowban treatment. I&#x27;m a thread. I&#x27;m a smart, good guy, and not a bad writer either, who did the startup thing (twice) and found it utterly worthless. (I&#x27;m PG&#x27;s Antichrist.) There are hundreds like me, in fact, but most people who fail at something slink away in shame, like it was their fault even if the game was totally rigged. Not me. I have to go back and warn the others, no matter how much I am to be punished for the service.<p>Is Y Combinator worth it? Hell yeah. I&#x27;d argue, at this point, that it&#x27;s <i>not</i> worth it to take on the Valley if you&#x27;re not backed by YC. The pipeline has been established, the game is over, the land has been mapped and the good gold mines are known. Whatever is the mid-21st-century&#x27;s engine of innovation, it will be far the fuck away from SillyCon Valley. In the mean time, VC-funded startups are the new I-banking and if you can get the acceleration that comes from the YC stamp of approval, you should absolutely do it. That&#x27;s not how I would like the world to be; but that&#x27;s how it is.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, though, that this subsociety (Silicon Valley) that claims to be advanced and futuristic is still, in truth, a feudalistic reputation economy in which who you know matters a hundred times more than what you know. (&quot;What you know&quot; only matters in terms of the savoir-faire needed to acquire backers.) It&#x27;s not about technical excellence any more and hasn&#x27;t been for some time.",1392490446

Naturally if you have more investors, you will have a lot investors talking about your deal to other investors.  Thus, the people who contact you inbound want to invest.  However, it has nothing to do with the fact that they are inbound, it is just that by the time they are contacting you, your fundraising already was dripping with social proof.<p>Conversely, at the beginning when you have no investors, you likely are going to have to contact some of them.  This is obviously going to have a much lower conversion rate, because you have no social proof!<p>Taken to the logical extreme, if inbound investors are so much more valuable than outbound, when you start fundraising you should just sit next to your telephone and wait for investors to call you.  But of course that won&#x27;t work, because it isn&#x27;t inbound investors that actually matter.

What you said is only true if by &quot;a lot of Rust&#x27;s benefits&quot; you mean &quot;basically none of its benefits&quot;.<p>It sounds like you are unhappy with some of the user interface decisions in Firefox and are trying to use this story as a way to spin this out into some sort of narrative of Mozilla&#x27;s decline and stagnation.",1392490048

However, there is one thing that confuses me so far.  Looks like a lot of links get a link_target attribute that is different from the actual link:<p><pre><code>  {\n   &quot;type&quot; : &quot;LINK&quot;,\n   &quot;text&quot; : &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Letter_Mail_Company&quot;,\n   &quot;link_data&quot; : {\n     &quot;link_target&quot; : &quot;http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2%2F\\\n                      en.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F\\\n                      American_Letter_Mail_Company\\\n                      &sa=D&sntz=1&usg=[alphanumeric token scrubbed]&quot;,\n     &quot;display_url&quot; : &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org\\\n                      /wiki/American_Letter_Mail_Company&quot;\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nHowever, links to Youtube, or Google, or any subdomain of either, have a link_target attribute identical to their display_url.  In-teresting.  I wonder what that alphanumeric token is.  It&#x27;s like how Google search results also have, rather than normal links, links to google.com/url?[a ton of URL parameters].  I assume the latter is so they can gather data about what URLs are clicked in the search results, or possibly pasted elsewhere, and conceivably to discourage scraping.  And as for this?<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s a kludge for Google chat clients, which need to parse URLs (they do something special with Youtube links) and might be thus freed to do it stupidly.  Perhaps Google wants to know what people do with their downloaded Hangout archives.  Perhaps Google wants to know what people do with Hangout history in the browser, and they&#x27;ve changed the links in that archive, and then they just leave it that way in the exported format.  --Turns out Hangout history in the browser has exactly those links... I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the last one.  Well, at any rate, at least it&#x27;s easy to ignore that field.",1392490014

F-yea! I&#x27;m a varsity software jock training for the Career Olympics!<p>Almost 2 decades later, a family to take care of, a little fatter, a little less healthy, a lot more tired, I look back and what difference did it make? There are a bunch of gadgets out there with my software in it. Am I retired? No. Did I change the world? No. Did I invent the next Linux? No. At least for the companies I worked for, my tireless efforts made the shareholders a bit more money, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>Look at it by the numbers. Suppose 1 out of every 10,000 jobs out there offer you the opportunity to reach whatever your goals are (ultra-wealth, change the world, create something awesome, whatever your goal is). I think 1 out of 10,000 is EXTREMELY generous given all those &quot;opportunities&quot; out there to build yet-another CRUD web app or yet another B2B IT portal or yet another crappy plastic consumer product. The career lifespan of a software engineer is (again generously) 40 years. If you&#x27;re an extreme job hopper you can probably try something new once a year. So you have 40 at-bats.<p>So,<p>P(home run) = 0.0001<p>N = 40<p>P = 1 - (1-P(hr))^N = 1 - (1-0.0001)^40 ~0.4%<p>So the likelihood of you lucking into that one life-changing opportunity throughout your entire career as an engineer is minuscule. Unless you really think you can both identify the next Facebook before it happens and land a job there while they&#x27;re tiny. A lot of people think they can do that. A lot of people also think they can pick stocks, predict horse races, or read tea leaves.<p>I&#x27;m not writing this to discourage you, but do understand that the extreme hours you are putting in now are a bet against enormous odds.

Either:<p>* human civilization is unlikely to reach a level of technological maturity capable of producing simulated realities, or<p>* a comparable civilization reaching this technological status will likely not produce a many simulated realities for any of a number of reasons, such as, diversion of computational processing power for other tasks, ethical considerations of holding entities captive in simulated realities, etc., or<p>* any entities with our general set of experiences are almost certainly living in a simulation.<p>Personally I think the biggest prima facie weakness in this argument is that while we will probably reach a point where simulating a human mind is feasible, and we will probably do so when that time comes, it may take a lot of computational mass to simulate a person.

7244652,comment,7243851,7243851,7,0,rk17,,,"Beside the point: I think this google plus problem is a symptom of a larger problem. Google still acts as if it&#x27;s a start-up, but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a company with a userbase that has come to rely on their products. Building integrated platforms - by hijacking existing ones in this case - requires planning, not multiple public iterations of crap. How many times has my Youtube GUI become more cluttered because of some integration they&#x27;re in the process of rolling out? People have really come to rely on these tools, they&#x27;re not the new trendy video-sharing website anymore.<p>Back on point: It&#x27;s just a description of reality that Google&#x27;s attempts at integration through Google Plus is causing a lot of annoyance and friction with its user base, even if the end-goal is more beneficial to both. For a lot of people their plus-accounts were made for them without their consent. There&#x27;s an option in youtube to also publish your comment on google plus, which is opt-out initialy; It remembers the setting of your last post. So you can raise question marks as to how accurate the numbers Google publishes about their Plus-network really are. I&#x27;m pretty sure there aren&#x27;t 500 million+ active users on the plus network in any meaningful way.<p>The real danger exposed in the article is that a lot of unknowing users are having their search results directly influenced by brands and companies that they&#x27;ve added to their circles. It&#x27;s also frustrating that there&#x27;s no option at the moment to turn off this bias. I think this going to come back to bite Google in the ass at some point in the future (I&#x27;m already using duck2go).<p>You add to the above the recent copy-wrong-slip-up and you could even say that there&#x27;s a video-sharing website up for grabs. Because the google plus integration is antagonizing a large share of youtubers and the copy-wrong issue has antagonized the most important part of their user base: Users that upload original quality content, 90% of all uploads is crap, right? I believe the best way to handle managing a platform of this scope is the Apple way. Because when Apple releases something it&#x27;s an event and everybody expects having to relearn some things. But when Google releases something it&#x27;s a YAIP - yet another initiative/project. So it&#x27;s really a succession of stupid moves on Google&#x27;s behalf causing the negative comments, I don&#x27;t think Google bashing comes into play in any way. (^-^)-",1392488035

Some small percentage of people who start out down the path you&#x27;re on make it to the end as true technical experts.<p>All I will do is put in a word that most people who start down that track don&#x27;t finish, but they still get a chance to change the world. Their chance comes through the coworkers they mentor, the spouses whose less-profitable careers their high-paying programming jobs support, and the children who they raise with, hopefully, some psychological balance.<p>Remember that this path is just as hard, requires as much thinking and practice, and is mastered by just as few people.  For now, if you don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re called to, great. But there&#x27;s nothing to be embarrassed about if you find out later that it is.<p>And if you get to that realization, approach the rest of life with the same zeal you poured into becoming a technical expert, plus perhaps a bit of new-found humility. Practice constantly, seek help from books and from people who have thought about the problem extensively (religious leaders, therapists, or trusted friends), and remember that you&#x27;re in training as an excellent person to be.<p>(Edit: I guess I should also say, I&#x27;m not sure the options are exclusive.

7244591,comment,7243757,7244210,21,0,shas3,,,"It is fallacious to say &#x27;just because our ancestors lived that way, it is good&#x27;. There is seldom sufficient evidence to back up such claims. Paleo diets [1] are not necessarily good. Nor are paleo-lifestyles [2]. Even several claims of paleo-enthusiasts like Christopher McDougal (&#x27;Born to Run&#x27;) and Jared Diamond are disputed and contradicted by research [3].<p>A posteriori, there may be &#x27;evolutionary&#x27;-type reasons for say, our body&#x27;s over-eagerness to eat sugary stuff [4]. That doesn&#x27;t mean that you can attribute everything to evolution without sufficient evidence.<p>The truth is what it is: lack of exercise and poor diet both contribute to increased risk of diseases. You can appeal to &#x27;our ancestors&#x27; lifestyle&#x27; as reliably as you can appeal to say, the benefits of &#x27;biblical diet&#x27;. Both are identically fallacious.<p>(As an aside, there are several comments on different posts in HN that wrongly apply evolutionary principles to everything from coding practices to behavioral traits [5]!)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-paleo-diet-half-baked-how-hunter-gatherer-really-eat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-paleo-diet-hal...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/is-barefoot-style-running-best-new-studies-cast-doubt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/is-barefoot-style-r...</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/09/history-society"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/09/history-society</a>\n[4]<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/opinion/evolutions-sweet-tooth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/opinion/evolutions-sweet-t...</a>\n[5]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7050286"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7050286</a>",1392487365

Take fitness for example- I hear guys bragging about how hard their routine is, how they train every day till exhaustion. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean anything. Trying to constantly be busy with something is a form of laziness if you think about it. It means not doing the things that really make the difference- those annoying ones, the ones we always leave for later.",1392487316

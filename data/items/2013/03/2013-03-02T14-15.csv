5309636,comment,5309330,5309592,2,0,lifeisstillgood,,,"Drone strikes against ""terrorists"" are almost exclusively over territory that is actively supportive of the ""freedom fighter"".  This is why there were so many bombings of weddings (if target X's niece is getting married you know he will turn up. So watch the uploads on Facebook or observe from the next hill.  Bomb the whole place when target arrives.  This was such bad PR it got stopped pretty fast)<p>Anyway my point is assassination with drones is hard and always has collateral - but if the target is in an area that is not actively protecting him then the traditional methods of walking up and shooting him is much more viable.  America has no such areas protecting terrorists (unless <i>maybe</i> some areas with the KKK but hardly.  Oh and actual members of go ernment but that's playing with the definition of terrorist too much)<p>I suspect it happens more than we hear about (Litveneko and the polonium being the obvious case)",1362236390

Because Apple puts sufficiently high specs in their machines so the user doesn't have to think about it, because it doesn't stall or perform tasks slowly.<p>Besides, this is HN. It's an objective discussion, not a marketing one.<p>>beauty and slickness and the UX of its software which is where the Pixel does indeed shine<p>I can't speak for the Pixel here, but OSX is the best OS I've ever used so I would be surprised to see a browser-only OS match that.<p>As for hardware, the Air is by far the best-designed laptop I've ever seen. I know people are praising the Pixel in this regard but to me it just looks like another ThinkPad. And as far that grey bar jutting out? Come on.<p>>As for the 32 GB, the Pixel comes with 1TB of google drive<p>I knew this would be brought up but I didn't want to bash Drive in my last reply. But here we go...<p>Somebody shared a single .png imagine with me this morning on Drive. I went into the Drive folder they shared it in, it's empty. I reload the web interface, folder is still empty. I try to search for the file name, it's not there. I reload the page again, still can't see the file in the folder, type the file name in the search box, and it finally appears in the search bar and I can open it. When I'm done I go back out, and it still doesn't appear in the folder it's in. The only way I can access this file is now to memorize the file name and search every time.<p>Not somewhere I'm willing to put hundreds of GBs of data just yet.<p>And something that's not brought up enough: data privacy. Google employees can view hundreds of GBs of your personal files, photos, documents, etc. on Drive.<p>With an SSD you know exactly who can access your files, and you can still choose to back up to a cloud service that actually offers encryption if you so wish (which I do).<p>Drive will most likely never offer encryption because Google makes its money from knowing as much about you as possible.",1362236185

5309594,comment,5309086,5309284,0,0,babarock,,,"The way I look at it the problem is a bit more subtle than that. In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not a US-citizen either.<p>Recent technology is making several business models (of which the RIAA is a great example) obsolete. These businesses are powerful enough not to die the way the typewriter or the analog photo film did. These laws (like the DMCA) are a cry for help, a last resort from a dying industry. This is why their side of the argument has always appealed to emotions and not reason. (""How would the world be without movies?"" - a complete straw man).<p>I don't believe it's a conspiracy to make the rich even richer, it has more to do with the difficulty of renewing oneself when technology makes you obsolete. The problem is that a few (or more) innocent casualties are going to get hurt as the Hollywood Titanic (yay, a metaphor!) goes down, but ultimately this whole ""technological protection measures"" shenanigan is going to disappear. Hollywood is doomed and it knows it.<p>That being said, I think the US is ahead of other countries when it comes to finding a solution to this problem. The effects of the SOPA/PIPA protests had on Congress is the obvious example, but more broadly, the constant ongoing debate looks promising. This debate is always avoided or dismissed as nonesense in France (where I currently live) and it cannot possibly be held in the Middle East (where I'm from).<p>I just wished the judiciary system wasn't so harsh on the scapegoats of this whole mess.

the file goes in <profile directory>/chrome/userContent.css.  On a conventionally installed Firefox on OS X, the profile directory is:<p><pre><code>  ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/<random characters>.default/

You may have to create your own ""chrome"" subfolder in there.  (I did.)  Some poking around reveals that the essays on Paul Graham's website achieve their indentation by sticking all the text in a <td width=455>.  455 pixels, then.  So I tried this CSS file, having spent all of three or so minutes looking at a CSS reference:<p><pre><code>  ~ $ cat heh.css
  p {max-width:455px}
</code></pre>
And installed that as <profile-dir>/chrome/userContent.css. ... This seems to have far-reaching implications.  It does make all the paragraphs on this website, except for the first one, fit in what is presumably a 455px box.  This also goes for Hacker News comments, and it also constricts the paragraphs on a website that pretty certainly has its own CSS.  I suspect the only thing that would override this is a CSS that specifically changed the max-width property of <p> objects.  (I expect a CSS expert would have been able to predict all of the above, except possibly the fact that it seems common for the first paragraph to not be in a <p> tag.)

The important part is that they recognize them and fix them. People can choose not to buy if the outstanding issues are important to them, but they seem to have chosen to buy en-masse instead...<p>Unless you are referring to those issues being, in part, from the non-open nature of some parts of the Pi. If that's so, I only have to point to every other platform where there's a ROM with non-open firmware. Being that on the Pi all firmware is loaded on startup, and on other platforms the firmware is there and all that the OS can do is work around it's bugs...",1362233744

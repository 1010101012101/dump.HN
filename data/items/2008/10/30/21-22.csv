Which I pay off monthly so it never accrues.<p>On the other hand bank transfers do have fees associated, and I'm not even sure how I'd go about initiating one. That does make transferring funds between individuals a pain. Cash and check are standard but each has its drawbacks.<p>PayPal sorta, kinda, addresses these difficulties but they claim their own pound of flesh on the transactions. I suspect it's a great startup opportunity but it's a regulatory minefield, and the entrenched behemoths are very efficient at maintaining the status quo.",1225400916

Once we stopped advertising the boost subsided. We get better kick for the buck directly sponsoring private forums with decent niche traffic.<p>We will probably experiment with higher value keywords at some point. The major issue is mostly conversion rates though - you need to charge a high price to justify spending a significant amount to attract one paying customer.<p>SEO is a much better approach, but it's interesting to see Google getting taken to the cleaners here by some of the more spam-oriented sites out there that really push the keywords into their domain names. Even the market leader in our field is not listed on the first page for the most important keyword related to their product.",1225400880

I remember when I made my first piece of software, and 3 days later someone bought it. I thought to myself - what? The software sucked big time! Then the next day, someone else bought, and so on.<p>A year later, I put up my first > $500 software, not really expecting anything to happen. A week later, a sale came in, a few days later, the same.<p>There was no marketing plan, no competition analysis, no snazzy web designer or any of all that. Just put up the site, list it on download.com.<p>Software is an easy business. The hard part is in learning all that stuff so you can actually make the software (or know how to tell people what to do), afterwards it's pretty easy if you just release your stuff.",1225400757

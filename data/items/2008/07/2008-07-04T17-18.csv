236374,comment,236236,236345,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I think you're missing the point, mainly that all that is programmed. There is no way a computer can truely evolve, only its software can.<p>Evolution is the response to external factors, mainly death, which prevents the spread of genetic material.<p>Now if you were to make an android that had all the risks a human does, like being hit by a car or eaten by a lion, and gave it two ROM sequences of commands that its consciousness is based on and whenever two androids 'reproduce' they only pass on one ROM sequence, then you would end up with genetic selection. Essentially all new androids would end up with the ROM sequences of the most successful andriods.<p>Factor in that there might be write errors and data corruption from radiation turning a 0 into a 1, then they might get true evolution.<p>However, a desktop computer or mainframe cannot evolve as it's one entity. Even thousands of them won't evolve as new computers aren't made through the joining of two hardware parts of two older PCs. It isn't like ""aww he's got your webcamera, honey"" or ""Oh no, he's got a cooling fan defect, one of the heat sinks isn't working properly"".<p>If PCs suddenly started becoming self-aware, every single one would be an alien to each other as it would be fundamentally unique.<p>A large portion of Asian people descend back to Ghengis Khan, Irish descend back to some warlord there. Our genetic tree as a species is illustrated by irregular growth and random dead ends, a computer won't achive that ever until they become so unrecognisably living that they risk being killed or eaten or choose not to have offspring, or conquer a country and have 500 kids with random androids.<p>Then there's things like Founder effect to consider, like a Micronesian islands population has 5% colour blindness and 30% carry it even though it's a 0.003% prevelance in the US. Why? Because everyone but 20 people died after a typhoon and 1 of the survivors had it, and since 1775 1/20th of the population is totally colour blind. If he'd have been killed, they'd have had 0% prevelance of colour blindness.",1215194242

236346,comment,235556,235556,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I'm actually relieved no one has commented on the weight being unsafe, like in the wired comment thread.<p>I'd just like to point out that some titanium alloys have the same strength at only one-eighth the weight of the strongest steel alloys. However the titanium alloy only carries one-eighth the kinetic energy and would greatly increase road safety if used extensively in cars.<p>I mean if a pickup weighs 4,000 lbs, and it can carry 2,000 lbs of materials before it doesn't have enough torque, reducing the trucks weight by 50% and not even changing the engine would mean it could carry 4,000 lbs of materials before it doesn't have enough torque.<p>That's a highly simplified explination, but the general principal is there. Any weight not wasted on the chassis, means the vehicle can tow/carry more at the same fuel consumption rate. What's even better is, like the 1L, if you make your car lighter you increase fuel efficiency greatly.<p>I mean I wonder how many Ford F-150's are out there that spend half their time wasting fuel as they're pulling around 2,000lbs of chassis they could do without, and could do with another 2,000lbs of extra carrying capacity when they are working.",1215191926

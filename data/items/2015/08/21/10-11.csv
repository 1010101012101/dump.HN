I worked for a bank and worked 60+ hrs a week. In fact many weeks were near 80 hours.  Providing credit cards to the poor was not what I considered a meaningful job.  But I was unhappy as well. It still took me 4+ years to figure out what I wanted to do.  It was a complex road and it took a lot of visualization of my ultimate satisfaction (note not happiness) before I was able to leave this very well paying role.<p>I now lead a small web development team at a university.  I scrum coach a broader high performing team, get to write some code (which I love even when I pound my head on the wall trying to figure out that defect) and interact with people that love what they do.<p>Even though I had not been much of a church goer, when I was on the table ahead of my bypass surgery and waiting to be knocked out I said a prayer to God asking if I was going to be alright.  I got a very strong answer that was &quot;You will be fine.  It is not about you but the kids.&quot; Well I thought, at the time, that was about my kids but I later learned it was about other kids.<p>So I came to be at a university. But the drive to help kids also has me mentoring FIRST robots teams, mentoring FIRST robotics coaches, being one of the organizers of a annual maker event (RVA MakerFest).  Speaking to high school students about a variety of topics, mentoring high school students and more.<p>I could probably be happier having a less complex life.  Many days start early working on the volunteer work and end after doing the same in the evening.<p>Getting to this place required an exercise in visualizing my demise. I was asked by someone to write down my obituary and what others would say.  I was not able to come up with much that was positive.  So I choose to find meaning helping K12 students and College Students.  My own kids now tell me how I was a grump before and now they love doing things with me (most of the time when not parenting).<p>As I now start to approach retirement (2 years) I will volunteer more not less.<p>For your pleasure you may find this helpful. I did. <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psy...</a>",1440154742

They&#x27;re just exposing the server-side models via REST interface and the server-side models in turn expose the database&#x27;s tables.

10096799,comment,10095678,10095678,0,0,asgard1024,,,"Regarding what he calls &quot;soft errors&quot; (a better name would be environmental errors, I think), it&#x27;s unfortunate that option 2 (error handlers) is so often neglected by programming language designers (for example Code Complete doesn&#x27;t mention option 2 at all).<p>In my view, just like option 4 (exceptions) is more general than option 3 (return values), also option 2 is more general than option 4. The biggest advantage of 2 compared to 4 is that recovery is much easier. However, more generality also unfortunately means more complexity (both for programmer and runtime). That&#x27;s why many people here prefer 3 to 4 or 2, and neither one of them is really better than the other.<p>Common Lisp is a good example of language that has good support for all three. It can return multiple values which facilitates option 3, it has usual exceptions as option 4, and most importantly, it also has signals and restarts that serve as option 2.<p>I would classify what he calls hard errors into two categories. One is inconsistent input and the other internal (logic) error. This depends on level of view, if you are looking only at one module or a bigger whole (inconsistent input into one module from the other can be considered internal error in the whole).<p>Now, I don&#x27;t think inconsistent input should be dealt with asserts. If it&#x27;s worth checking the inconsistent input at the module boundary, do it and return an error (in any of the three ways mentioned above). The caller should decide whether or not this is a logic error (it may also be bad input from the user), and how to handle the failure.<p>While I agree with the statement that on logic errors one should generally fail hard, sometimes it&#x27;s not desirable, for instance in server you may want to just restart the wrong thread instead of shutting down the whole server.<p>Finally, I think asserts are very much underrated in the current development practices, compared to tests. I wish the effort spent on testing frameworks would be spent on frameworks that would let you add lots of asserts into the code and turn them on/off as needed (for example based on required tradeoff between reliability and performance).",1440154360

If you don&#x27;t check them in your function code, they would add to the list of exceptions that your function can throw. It would basically turn every function you write with return type T into Either<T, ExceptionA, ExceptionC, ExceptionH> with syntax sugar that would transfer exceptions between calls so you don&#x27;t have to spend your time with constant transfering of error properties of your return objects.<p>This would allow you to check stuff on places you desire (sometimes right after function, sometimes in the UI thread) and have tooling support for managing what is left unchecked.<p>Let&#x27;s build something like that for C# using Roslyn! Issues of Java-style checked exceptions can be overcome using proper typing with generics.",1440152587

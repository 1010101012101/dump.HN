The overwhelming majority of people in the world don't get to work in cool offices, on cool problems, with cool co-workers who want to solve difficult problems with them.  The majority of us spend our days under fluorescent lights working on mundane business-intelligence type things.  Not to say that creativity cannot be found in anything, but sitting in my dorm hacking until all hours of the morning because I didn't <i>really</i> have to go to class is certainly more conducive to creativity than working an 8:00-6:00 and going to bed at 10:00 because I have to be up in the morning.<p>While college might not really offer much in the way of knowledge acquisition (at least until grad school), it <i>would</i> does offer the time to work on things you're passionate about, and network with other people of similar inclinations.<p>I dropped out of college when I was 19, and it was one of the dumbest things I've ever done.  For somebody who is already a member of the silicon valley set, this might be good advice, for everybody else this train of thought is parasitic.<p>(I'm not saying that networking and hacking and soforth isn't possible when you're working a ""real"" job [hell, I spend almost every waking second I'm not spending at my job hacking and writing and networking], I'm just saying that college is a better environment for it)",1307130994

This was a buy-out of early shareholders.

2617759,comment,2616773,2617017,1,0,auganov,,,"Well an MMO on average provides far far more content, it's simply a more intense and complete gaming experience. It's more unique. At least it used to be. MMOs are definitely slowly shifting away from the subscription model to the freemium one (some start experiment with ads but I don't think there's anything significant so far). The shift is obviously because  there's more MMOs, they loose their uniqueness factor and it's so much cheaper to develop and then maintain them.
Nowadays if you want to make a significant subscription based MMO it would have to be really cutting edge or very niche (check out WW II online, but keep in mind it's not a financial success, they can just support themselves).<p>Why did I pay for my friends?
Well some were not even friends. I was basically a leader of a ""tribe"" there and made an ""invitation contest"" (every member could invite people to the tribe, top 3 inviters would get the ""premium points from me"".
But let's be honest, the true underlying reason is ""oh look how cool I am, I gave you a gift"", in fact that little contest of mine was somewhat a scam, I made sure the right people won :-)<p>But generally speaking browser games and MMOs are very different in almost all aspects. Revenue models might be getting similar but everything else is fundamentally different. I guess that doesn't need explanation.<p>As for the money making potential I think MMO market is definitely over-saturated, competition is very fierce and barriers to entry big.<p>Web browser market is very saturated too, but mainly with low quality stuff, as in it's no sooo hard to build something better. But the downside is that most games really struggle with profits there.",1307130949

There are numerous companies that have blown hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and ended up with a tiny user base (I can think of a particular MVNO a few years back.) Then you have failed acquisitions such as Cisco buying Flip, where the buyer ends up shutting the company down.<p>Neither Groupon's customer or business acquisition strategy is a coin flip. They know very well what these users and business's are worth and they have all of the tools in place to monetize them.<p>Without an extremely aggressive and hyper growth strategy, Groupon stands little chance against Google or Facebook. If they wanted a path on easy street, the original investors could have sat around pocketing millions of dollars a month for years. Once Groupon decided to go big or go bust their profile was raised to the point that ceased to be an option.<p>The real wild cards here are not so much what Google and Facebook do but rather what the business clients do. There is a very fine balance between delivering great value to both sides of the equation. Tipping too far in one direction destroys their brand. I've heard plenty of complaints from users about the quality of Groupon's deal offerings.<p>If Groupon can continue to demonstrate an ability to successfully overcome these challenges while staying a step ahead of Google and Facebook, they might be around for a while.<p>Will they deliver fantastic returns for shareholders at a mature $20 billion valuation over the long term?

If they don't, the wolf will be at the door in a hurry.<p>Which, by the way, is in marked contrast to the kind of negative buzz Google had at the time of their IPO.  There were legitimate doubts about the sustainability of their business model, in part because they were deliberately concealing the size of their profits as long as they could to avoid attracting competition.  (See Levy, ""In the Plex"".)  But at the time they went public, they were making money, in much larger amounts than anybody outside the company had realized.<p>As to Groupon: if dhh is reading the balance sheet right, they need the proceeds of the IPO just to keep the company going, unless something very dramatic happens soon.   They have only two quarters' worth of cash on hand at the current burn rate.  The $750 million from the IPO will extend that by about two years (if the burn rate doesn't go up!).  But if you invest, then you're counting on management to pull a not-yet-evident rabbit out of a hat within that time.  And you're expecting that from a management team that put most of the roughly $1 billion that they raised off private markets in the last two rounds in their own private pockets (they sold founder shares to the VCs), leaving only $150 million available to the business itself as working capital.<p>Good luck!",1307128892

I don't have access to a newer Dalvik VM for this device. The Dalvik JIT compiler is definitely enabled, because performance gets much worse when I disable it.<p>Here are SciMark scores (HIGHER numbers are better):<p><pre><code>    ARM11    SciMark SMALL | FFT     SOR      MC    SPARSE    LU
    -----------------------+---------------------------------------
    Lua 5.1.4         0.60 |  0.50    0.92    0.36    0.55    0.69
    LuaJIT git        4.34*|  2.61*   6.70*   3.91*   3.13    5.36*
    Dalvik 1.2.0+JIT  3.35 |  2.35    5.65    1.09    3.39*   4.27
</code></pre>
Those are not too relevant, though, since it's a soft-float device. The maximum speedup is limited by the high cost of the soft-float operations (e.g. 62 cycles for a double-precision FP ADD).<p>And here are some simple integer benchmarks, run time in seconds (LOWER numbers are better):<p><pre><code>    ARM11            fannkuch 10   nsieve-bits 8   binary-trees 11
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    LuaJIT git           7.45*          3.04*           2.05*
    Dalvik 1.2.0+JIT    12.83          10.42            4.02

Note that binary-trees is a GC-intensive benchmark where LuaJIT usually loses against Java VMs, since they have a much better GC. Not so for Dalvik it seems.<p>The winner for each benchmark is marked with a '*'. Looks good. ;-)",1307128736

Chaining pipes together in Python with subprocess can get a little wordy, but the power is there to do anything you need to do.<p>It's especially excellent when compared to Ruby. Ruby has a bunch of popen calls, but each one has strange quirks and inflexibility to make it not good for building pipelines.<p><a href=""http://whynotwiki.com/Ruby_/_Process_management#How_do_I_execute_an_external_program.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whynotwiki.com/Ruby_/_Process_management#How_do_I_exe...</a><p>I'm finding myself using a ton more shell (bash) for pipelines, as this is what it was built to do, but when I need to add more logic its Python and subprocess.",1307128116

In that circumstance, there probably wouldn't be any problem giving the iPads to the people and no legal issue would arise.<p>However if we were using the Free iPad offer as a way to promote the organization (ie in advertising, a banner or in our printed promotional material), we might get a cease-and-desist letter asking us to not use their trademark. And they might have a leg to stand on there.<p>edit: added some clarifying details",1307128103

If I understand correctly (the article is very confusingly worded in some places), he is saying that weak passwords are weak.  Anyone who cares about privacy should already be choosing long, complex, strong passwords for this kind of application.<p>Also, I'm confused about one feature of JD.  When I signed up years ago, they allowed me to hold my key privately and it never left the client.  I had the option to upload that key to the server, if I wanted to, or not.  I understand from the article that the client might misbehave and, for example, share my key in ways I don't want it to.  Am I getting this right?<p>When I looked into secure cloud-based storage two years ago, I found that JD was the best mix of privacy and convenience, if for no other reason than it could be deployed on a mix of Windows, Mac and Linux boxes.  It was clear even then that data integrity was the weak link/trade off.<p>I'm interested in hearing about the latest, best solutions for easy, cross-platform, secure backups to cloud services that offer better data integrity.",1307128071

I'll admit there are some, though, especially in software development and literature.<p>""competition rather than collaboration"" - I've actually had classes that graded on a legit curve.  that meant the bottom X% of the class failed, no matter how well they did.  Just because others -in that class- were better.  I've only ever been in 1 group-project class.  (And group-project classes have their own problems.)<p>""regurgitation rather than learning"" - It's incredibly difficult to test for learned knowledge, rather than just memorization.<p>""theory rather than application"" - Colleges don't generally teach enough to get to the 'application' part.  Even medical school has students intern for months before they have enough practical experience to actually do the job.<p>I think the time is rapidly approaching where we are going to have to tailor the education to the subject, instead of the other way around.  Doctors need a tremendous amount of memorization to do their jobs.  The current system can work fairly well for them.  Software developers, on the other hand, need a tremendous amount of practice, and rote memorization is pretty much useless.<p>Existing schools are not prepared for this change.  Most of them will resist it mightily until someone comes along and forces them out of the game because of it.",1307127953

Could share source code, etc.  IMO, most interesting parts are the key scoping, which allow users to selectively publish (""share"") portions of stored data by publishing the appropriately scoped keys.<p>SpiderOak uses AES256 in CFB mode with authentication via HMAC.  The code is careful about unique nonce/counter usage, crypto code is confined to specific modules that rarely change, and reviewed by cryptographers outside SpiderOak.  Client and server have minimal trust relationship.<p>Being paranoid about data integrity (not only because of crypto issues, but also because bitrot happens routinely at petabyte scale) the data authentication happens repetitively at a few different layers.   From all end user devices, we see about one bit error per 4.2tb of upload transactions.",1307127816

I've discovered otherwise now, so the ""hill of beans"" comment is wrong. Sorry.<p><i>:) That's a game of semantics. Gold's current price has little to do with its luxury good status, and everything to do with its scarcity and historical claim to fame as a currency.</i><p>""Semantics"" have nothing to do with it. Commodities [0] != currencies [1], whether you're familiar with the definitions or not. One exists as a medium of exchange, while the other is a good with no differentiation between sources. Currencies are differentiated by the trustworthiness of the governments that issue them (you'd probably accept a US dollar today before accepting a German papiermark [2] in 1924).<p>Also, gold's price is a function of the market's supply and demand for gold as either (a) an investment vehicle or (b) an input in the production of goods. Investors don't give a damn that the US dollar was pegged to gold 200+ years ago--they're simply investing in it to make money.<p>The idea that gold is ""currency"" is ridiculous. Name a first-world country where gold is widely accepted as currency. Some places in some parts of the world might accept gold, but it's not backed by a central body nor does it carry a relatively stable value (unlike fiat money).<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_papiermark"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_papiermark</a>",1307127680

2664005,comment,2663905,2663905,14,0,pseudonym,,,"Getting a server error when I hit the page, so pasting the text of the article below:<p>One of our jobs is to find technologies that will help the wine industry succeed.  We often look outside the wine industry to find incredible solutions that help wineries in any way possible.  Through extensive research, analysis, and lots of white board sessions we try to surface the technologies that seem most helpful.  Fortunately we have only made two mistakes in technologies that we have strongly supported in our three year history.  Our most notable was Scvngr.<p>In the beginning, Scvngr seemed like it had innovated where other platforms had stagnated (Gowalla and Foursquare were struggling to innovate at the time).  They offered a level of interactivity that was not just about checking in but about engagement.  They had fair pricing and a rapidly growing user base.  We loved the way they viewed game theory.  So as a location based service that would work for the wine industry, we chose them.<p>Everything was champagne and roses at first.  Scvngr offered rewards for engagement.  In a hospitality industry, this seemed like a perfect fit.  They had unique features (taking pictures, answering quizes, etc) and fun mapping tools called Treks to tie locations together to earn rewards.  Scvngr loved the wine industry because we represented a use case for regions that could easily overlay a game layer with mass tourism and strong hospitality culture.  For us it also represented an innovative way to engage consumers in both the digital world and the physical world and deepen the engagement when people visit any winery tasting room.<p>Scvngr made us promises to ensure this was a giant success (with the potential that they could roll it out to other tourist/hospitality based locations with our case study like Las Vegas, Disneyland, et al).  This is what they committed:<p>Promise: They promised to give all Napa merchants (restaurants, retailers, hotels, etc) free Scvngr rewards programs and games.  They also promised to support businesses with training and help to understand how to build rewards and more.\nResult: They soon released this feature to all businesses nullifying the value and barely touched anyone who signed up.<p>Promise: They promised to have a Mashable party in Napa to celebrate their new launch with Robert Mondavi Winery and Franciscan winery as part of a major release.  They even talked about it with a strong press initiative.\nResult: We are still waiting.<p>Promise: Setting up multiple Napa treks to make game play in Napa incredibly interesting for Napa tourists.  This was intended to spread to Paso Robles, Sonoma, Walla Walla, and beyond.\nResult: Pretty much the same as above.<p>Promise: They assured us that they would add new game mechanics that would be extraordinarily useful to the wine industry.\nResult: The platform has been stagnant since their VC investment of $15 million dollars and their focus completely changed to a new product called thelevelup.com (yes, another flash in the pan  flash sale site).<p>Our promise: We would share our passion about their innovative product, our time, and our relationships to help the wine industry benefit from this new type of engagement.  We signed a contract for biz dev fees which we waived to give discounts to all wineries that work with us on digital brand management so they could be involved in the treks and more.  Three of our wineries signed up, one pre-paid (and was fortunately refunded but only after threatening legal action).\nI recently saw a Scvngr campaign with the Napa Valley Vintners for the annual auction (I am curious how successful the campaign was) and upon calling Scvngr, their statement was, We dont have the time or resources to dedicate to those previous promises.  If you can find us some resellers . . .  Uh, no.  How about you fulfill your promises made to us and the wine industry as a whole.<p>All indicators pointed to Scvngr becoming a winner and helping wineries deepen their engagement with consumers.  Sorry to all that joined us in this debacle.  We really believed in them and made a rare mistake betting on their horse.  The net net is that we picked a dog.<p>Perhaps it was the money that diluted their focus. Perhaps the VCs shifted direction and the young management didnt have the experience to properly communicate. Perhaps they dont understand the meaning of a partnership or a promise.  Maybe they dont like the wine industry.  Whatever the reason, the lesson for us was make sure vision is supported by execution and find partners that really keep their promises.  In this case, we have ALL deleted Scvngr from our mobile phones and we are back on Foursquare (who has lapped Scvngr times ten in the last six months with awesome functionality) and Gowalla.<p>Visit us anytime at the tank and check in (with Foursquare or Gowalla, that is).",1308275284

2663992,comment,2662617,2663192,2,0,nightski,,,"I hate the tool argument.  Programming languages are as much a tool as mathematics or English.  I think of them more as a method of communication, a way to express your thoughts and ideas.  Not only that but they are executable and unambiguous (most of the time heh).  A programming language not only has the power to allow you to express your thoughts, but even to even shape them.<p>The power of this field is in its infancy.  There will be a day when ""programming"" as we call it is as natural part of the user experience of machines as browsing facebook might be today.  In fact it will be expected, and products that do not allow this rich interaction from the user will be shunned.  Programming will be second nature and humans will not desire it, nay they will demand it.  It is akin to granting freedom to those subjected to slavery.  It really changes ones entire world view.<p>But by dismissing these powerful constructs as mere simple tools this vision will never be realized.<p>This is the flaw in Zed's argument.  Learning new languages may not have been valuable to him (which in reality I doubt) simply because he hasn't expanded enough into the areas less explored.  There is so much room for innovation here that the journey hasn't even begun.  He is writing off something so incredibly powerful and world shaping simply because he lacks the imagination to see it.  The sad part is that he is inflicting this view on those new to the profession that may across his old ""wisdom"".",1308275022

2663989,comment,2661364,2663891,7,0,gjm11,,,"> And yet now we know that the total radiation release was probably as much or more than Chernobyl.<p>We do? Evidence, please.<p>For what I think is the conventional view, see e.g. <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13050228"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13050228</a> which indicates more than 10x more radiation release from Chernobyl. That was a couple of months ago; has the situation changed drastically since then?<p>(On 2011-04-12, when the incident was reclassified at IAEA level 7, a TEPCO spokesman made some comment about the Fukushima disaster having released more radiation than the Chernobyl one. I'm pretty sure that was simply not true.)<p>I think the ""MIT"" response was basically correct and remains so despite scaremongering like that linked to here. The Fukushima plant was hit by an enormous natural disaster; yes, the results were very bad, but they were very much smaller in both human and economic terms than those of the earthquake+tsunami itself and so far the known death toll (due to radiation as opposed to, e.g., things falling on people's heads) from the damage to the nuclear reactors is ... zero.<p>That doesn't mean the damage isn't a problem, it doesn't even mean it's not a disaster. It does, however, mean this: A large, aging nuclear facility was struck by a huge natural disaster, much worse than it was ever designed for (which was, yes, a Bad Thing) -- and the result, so far at least, has not involved death or disease on a large scale.<p>If that's as bad as the downside of nuclear power gets, it's looking pretty good.<p>(What's the downside of the alternative? Well, imagine that the Fukushima reactors hadn't been built and that the energy they provided had come from coal-fired power stations instead. Generating energy from coal costs about 15 deaths per TWh in the US, according to <a href=""http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-so...</a>; Japan is probably similar. The Fukushima plant produced a bit less than 880 TWh of energy over its lifetime. That's about 13,000 deaths. Even with the disaster, there's no way that the Fukushima plant has caused anything near to that many.)",1308274815

But I point out that even if you did the impact wouldn't be that huge.  The impact you point out is to sales, not the actual consumer.<p>There are several reasons why this is the case:<p>1) Your warranty is almost certainly not owned by the company, but rather another company who will continue to fulfill it.<p>2) Service centers will continue to thrive.  In fact sales are often loss leaders so that they can host authorized service centers.<p>3) AAA has almost all of the services provided by most car companies.<p>4) Parts for discontinued cars can still be made, and often/usually are.<p>Most people have virtually no contact with the corporation after they purchse their cars.<p>so yes, going bankrupt will have a huge impact on Ford's bottomline.  But if you bought a Ford car today and tomorrow they went bankrupt, the impact on you, as the average consumer, will be close to zero.",1308274399

There wasn't copy and paste. There was also only EDGE/GPRS support, no multitasking (of any form except for a few built-in apps), no third party apps, no MMS, no SMS forwarding, no group SMS. It was only available in the US and only for AT&T subscribers. In many sense of the term, it is an MVP and it worked. It's just an MVP that was very polished.<p>As it rolled out releases, there were both enhancements and spots where they aren't as polished which was improved in a later release. Push Notifications in 3.0 + the coming Notifications center in 5.0 comes to mind.<p>So, they did an MVP with iPhone, initial features were minimum, but a selected subset of them are extremely polished. In fact if you look at many successful iPhone apps, this seems to be a very successful model.<p>Perhaps this approach only works on Apple's ""target market"". But I'd like to think this is an excellent approach when working with mass market consumers.<p>This link where Steve Jobs commented about Segway's marketing and launch is not totally relevant, but still interesting - <a href=""http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3533.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3533.html</a>",1308274208

This issue is analogous to that of long-running scripts, for which user agents already have safeguards. However, long-running draw calls can cause loss of interactivity for the entire window system, not just the user agent.<p>In the general case it is not possible to impose limits on the structure of incoming shaders to guard against this problem. Experimentation has shown that even very strict structural limits are insufficient to prevent long rendering times, and such limits would prevent shader authors from implementing common algorithms.<p>User agents should implement safeguards to prevent excessively long rendering times and associated loss of interactivity. Suggested safeguards include:<p>Splitting up draw calls with large numbers of elements into smaller draw calls.\nTiming individual draw calls and forbidding further rendering from a page if a certain timeout is exceeded.\nUsing any watchdog facilities available at the user level, graphics API level, or operating system level to limit the duration of draw calls.\nSeparating the graphics rendering of the user agent into a distinct operating system process which can be terminated and restarted without losing application state.\nThe supporting infrastructure at the OS and graphics API layer is expected to improve over time, which is why the exact nature of these safeguards is not specified.""",1308273824

Doing Phd helps because most of the time one gets to work on interesting stuff and get paid by grants. Work at a good place like IBM ( and any other company which provides research based work ) would help me achieve both ( money and good work ). I can try and do routine software work for some company and carry out interesting projects in free time but it will have some limitations. At this stage of my life I cannot sit and do just research. I need someone to pay me for my living.",1308272654

Not better or worse, just different. You may find that people treat you harshly because you can create software, maybe using words like ""nerd"". Maybe you will find that because you can dissect their logic that they hate arguing with you. You may even find that simply knowing how a computer works makes you annoying and weird to them.<p>To this I have one just piece of advice: they can go to hell. The world needs more weird people who know how things work and who love to figure it all out. When they treat you like this, just remember that this is your journey, not theirs. Being different is not a crime, and people who tell you it is are just jealous that you have picked up a skill they never in their wildest dreams could acquire.<p>You can code. They cannot. That is pretty damn cool.""",1308272459

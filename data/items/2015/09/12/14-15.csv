I had a Lumia 620 for a while and it was pretty hard to understand what was going on for some applications (aside from the fact that their back button behavior was something that was completely confusing). It&#x27;s odd too because some of the non-Microsoft WP8 apps were very easy to use by comparison, but the Microsoft designed apps were the worse in terms of usability for me. So, I&#x27;m not sure if its the design aesthetics at play here or maybe just that some developers are better are conveying what certain UI elements do and what to expect from them. Either way, I think there has to be a middle ground between removing clutter from UI and avoiding what amounts to snow blindness for computers. In my opinion, the Material Design spec by Google is closer to the sweet spot than what I&#x27;ve seen so far (I think it needs more UI hinting of some kind and less empty space which makes it harder for me to focus on what&#x27;s going on in an app).",1442069785

The Author&#x27;s Guild, separately, sued a non-profit partner in the Google Books scanning project -- HathiTrust. [1]<p>That lawsuit was not resolved until 2012 -- when, without a settlement, HathiTrust won on fair use.<p>The court decided that scanning books for searching was fair use. While the court did not say the same for displaying full text -- what the OP wants -- it is notable that the court&#x27;s opinion was not primarily based on non-profit status of the organization (as is common in U.S. fair use case law; the non-profit factor has generally dwindled in court decision-making), but on transformativeness.<p>The OP mentions &quot;Others argued that the settlement could create a monopoly in online, out-of-print books,&quot; but gives that opinion rather short shrift. This was a very real concern -- what if Google&#x27;s use really would be fair use? If the court decided that, the opinion would apply as precedent to everyone. But a settlement really does apply only to Google -- no one else even had access to the terms of the settlement. Anyone else trying to do the same would risk being subject to a decade-long lawsuit of their own.<p>The OP should ask, why didn&#x27;t Google go to trial?<p>&quot;If Google was, in truth, motivated by the highest ideals of service to the public....&quot; they should have gone to trial to establish the right for all. As HathiTrust did.<p>The Google Books project still exists, they did not take it down because of legal worries, even in the absence of the settlement. But it has indeed been allowed to languish. While I&#x27;m sure the multi-year lawsuit contributed to this -- Google starting ambitious projects and then allowing them to languish, without improvement, without fulfilling their original promise, slowly degrading and withering away -- is a pretty common Google practice even without multi-year lawsuits.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._HathiTrust"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._HathiTr...</a>",1442069113

In addition to Clojure, this disqualifies Scheme (and its dialects.)<p>Different Lisps (by your definition) take different approaches to things like namespace separation (Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2) and scope (dynamic vs. lexical).

They do not contribute to anyone or anything. For all intents and purposes, they might as well not have existed at all.

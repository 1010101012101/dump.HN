In the case of the USD, the dollar is roughly pegged to CPI. Unbacked commodities that aren't pegged by a central authority tend to be on a highly volatile random walk, with or without futures markets.<p>EDIT: Looks like I mistyped, maybe it looked like I was saying the opposite.",1366210779

If a Ferrari is speeding along at 120 MPH, which might be easily within its capabilities, there will be problems when it encounters the small Hyundai that can only achieve 90 comfortably.<p>Plus there's the issue of driver's ability as well. Can you look in your side mirror and successfully gauge the speed of the car that's a good distance behind you to know whether you can safely change lanes? If the car is going at a known max speed, of which you are probably aware of as you are likely at that speed yourself, then you can change but if the car is going two to three times faster than you I would imagine changing lanes would be a bad idea.<p>Also, how would the police be able to judge the things you describe looking at your car driving by at 120 MPH while everyone else is driving in the 80s? The officer would have to constantly be pulling these people over to check their ""licensed to speed"" status. How would the officer be able to judge the conditions of your car as you breeze by?

It's now possible to develop web applications that offer comparable user experience to say iOS/Android/Windows etc. As with those other platforms, to get the full user experience, the developer usually has to learn and use their native libraries and languages (Object-C for iOS, Java for Android, etc). For the web, the language is JavaScript and the library is HTML5 (the DOM manipulation that is).<p>Unlike those other platforms, plain JavaScript + DOM manipulation can get out of hand pretty quickly. It works when to create 'web application' means adding a few jQuery DOM manipulations here and there, backed by your favourite server framework. But when the amount of JavaScript you have to write grows, you need a way to structure it (design patterns, modules, etc). GWT, if I remember correctly, tried to address the issue of unmanageable JavaScript by allowing you to use Java on the server side and then it will compile and serve JavaScript to the client. This seemed like a good idea but the problem still remained: You're essential writing software in one platform to run in another. There will always be a penalty somewhere (do you remember how long it took to get the first JavaServer Faces framework with HTML5 render?).<p>The basic driving force of MV* JavaScript framework is to address the issue of writing clean, manageable and performing JavaScript code targeting the browser itself and not some intermediate platform. With the end goal being to provide a better user experience.<p>Is this worth learning? Well, do you think applications built using client-side JavaScript provide better user experience? Think Twitter, Gmail and the likes. Do you think your clients will appreciate such kind of applications?",1366210233

They certainly moved from where they were in the first picture, which shows a fairly thinly populated area. My impression is that they hadn't yet chosen their vantage point, perhaps having just arrived. But in the later pictures, they appear to be standing still and watching the runners with everyone else. When I say they don't seem to be moving, I mean they don't appear to be moving relative to the crowd around them, eg departing the area.<p>I'm guessing they're not significant because while they first drew attention for both carrying heavy-looking bags (a black backpack and a blue duffel), that may be a subconscious bias towards the fact that there were two explosions. On the other hand, the two explosions were separated by a city block; so unless one or both of them were spotted a similar distance away from the start point, the fact of the two big bags is probably just coincidence.<p>So many people were taking photos and video that by the time the investigation is done, I imagine there'll be a patchy but contiguous animation of people's movements through the area, at which point it'll be far easier to spot dichotomies in behavior between race viewers and the criminal(s) that carried out the bombing.",1366210138

This saves the attacker half of the PBKDF2 work factor.<p>This is a weakness in PBKDF2 when used to generate key material longer than the underlying hash function output length.

I won't apologize for the agency, we have more than our share of problems, but I also think we get more than our share of criticism for bad patents.<p>The PTO simply has no ability to change patent law. We apply it as it's written by Congress and interpreted by the courts. A few points on the law without getting into criticism of the agency (you can get easily find that elsewhere):<p>1. The burden on patent applicants is too low. There's a presumption that a patent will issue as soon as it's filed. The patent examiner has to prove that whatever is claimed was obvious, didn't work, wouldn't work, etc. If the patent examiner can't meet that burden, the patent issues. The patent applicant doesn't have to tell us about the state of the art prior to the ""invention"", what the improvement is, or why it deserves a patent.<p>2. As discussed upthread, the obviousness standards are too low. If you can't find evidence that each and every aspect of a claim was in the prior art, you have to allow the patent. Even then, a patent attorney can attack the rejection if the different prior art documents wouldn't fit well together. As an examiner, you can't simply say that something would have been obvious, with no supporting evidence. If you try to make such a rejection, the patent attorney will appeal your rejection, you'll get reversed on appeal and the patent will issue anyway.<p>3. The process naturally skews towards patent applicants. Most (nearly all) patent applicants have an attorney who is fighting 100% for as broad a patent as possible. The examiner is supposed to be a neutral arbiter who applies the law in an evenhanded fashion. There's no party fighting for the public, pushing back hard against the patent attorney. It's like a courtroom where only one side of the story is presented.<p>You can find a lot commentary/criticsm of the patent examination process online BTW, but not generally on the tech sites - look more towards legal/academic literature.<p>(Speaking on my own behalf, not the agency's)",1366209090

Ember.js, Angular.js, and other frameworks that offer two-way data binding are great because they take care of the dom manipulation details developers have typically had to manage by hand in the past. It frees people up to worry more about the business logic of their javascript apps. So if you're a javascript developer sick of writing boilerplate DOM manipulation code, Ember.js is definitely worth learning. I'm partial to Angular.js because it was built with testability in mind.<p>> Will it make me a better programmer (like learning Haskell will)?<p>Probably not, but it will make you a more productive programmer.<p>> Will it enable me to get a pay rise from my current 480 per day contracting fees?<p>If you're writing Java on your main contract, probably not. This is a bizarre question anyways and probably the source of your down-votes.

If you aren't, or you are against the idea of building single-page applications, then these frameworks won't really do much for you. Although, you can still get some value out of them.",1366208839

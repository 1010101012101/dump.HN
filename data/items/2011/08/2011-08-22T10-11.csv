For instance, G+ does not use X-Content-Security-Policy (<a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/CSP/Specification"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/CSP/Specification</a>) and uses X-XSS-Protection instead, which is a solution not exactly designed properly. (Noscript is a slightly better implementation, but since its client side, no dice)<p>You can also check this at Wekbit: <a href=""https://bugs.webkit.org/buglist.cgi?keywords=XSSAuditor&resolution=---"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.webkit.org/buglist.cgi?keywords=XSSAuditor&...</a><p>Many G website just disable that filter afaik because sometimes it can be misused by the attacker.<p>I suppose that Chrome will eventually support X-Content-Security-Policy or something similar and then G sites will switch to that.",1314007919

On Linux, you can use 'tc' to simulate that.<p>I had a 384 Kbit, ~100ms-latency crappy SDSL connection until recently (was renting in the Santa Cruz mountains in a location that had poor connection options), and it was pretty amazing how two sites that looked very similar from a fast connection, would load <i>much</i> differently on the slow connection, often for reasons not really inherently connected to the site's needs (it's one thing if it's loading slowly due to streaming video, versus due to having a gigantic background-wallpaper image, or unnecessarily serialized roundtrips).",1314007569

And it used to be false.<p>It used to be that you should develop and test on the newest, fastest hardware available, because PC sales were growing exponentially and by the time your software had sat in a shrink-wrapped box in a shop somewhere for three months, most of your potential customers would have more powerful PCs than you could buy now.<p>This scenario is now wrong in two respects.<p>First, PCs are now a mature market. Sales are flat. People and companies are going longer and longer without upgrading. So a greater proportion of the market is using older hardware.<p>Second, the supply chain is shorter. Obviously in the case of a website, the update is instant. But even in the case of Apple's app store, it takes less than a month to get your app in your customers' hands.",1314007518

Correct tests, fixtures/factories and model as necessary.<p>The controller should be thin, make 1 or 2 calls to the model while mapping or cleaning input, then the response. If your controller actions are thick then your model sucks and isn't encapsulated or you have complicated response logic. Avoid these by writing great encapsulated models. understand the presenter pattern.<p>I've worked in sections of code that doesn't consider my opinion as advice and dechipering wtf was going on was anything but quick, and I probably introduced bugs because I couldn't understand how everything worked.<p>Tldr, controllers are glue code.

Curiously, this can actually take a lawyer more time to review (and, hence, cost more money).  I'd at least consider asking the lawyer for their base form that is the closest starting point for your business and working from that to prepare your first draft for their review.<p>Virtually any lawyer that does the same type of work repeatedly will have a set of base forms they usually start from.  The cost benefit is that they don't have to review things in as much detail because they are already familiar with it (they essentially draft and review documents as diffs from their base form).  If you give them a form they've never seen, they literally have to read (and understand) every word.",1314007324

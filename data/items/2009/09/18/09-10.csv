Your original link read like a blog - of which the first post was about that one form of traffic calming. I think it was an easy mistake to make thinking it was blog spam because that other link posted is apparently the original source of the photo's/story.<p>The fact you had additional content was less clear and probably was missed by some (especially after the blogspam comment was added). According to the guidelines: <i>Please submit the original source. If a blog post reports on something they found on another site, submit the latter.</i><p>If people thought it was not original source they might flag it.<p>The second one is a bit more complicated. It was a somewhat over the top title (and I know it comes straight from the source link). Personally I would have supported editing it - though I do agree the title chosen was somewhat dull and misleading too!<p>With all that said there has been a marked increase in active moderation I noticed since being back from holiday this week. Notably the Eddie Izzard topic was killed off despite being top of the front page for a while (probably rightly killed off but I havent seen that happen much before).<p>New mod? or stricter policies?<p>At the end of the day I dont think it will reflect on you much :) I've found people dont care too much about a feww seeming ""indescretions"" (valid or not)",1253267064

I never realized that it was your work, your life blood, and your property that I was so recklessly and wantonly stealing from. My teachers never even mentioned the word &quot;copyright&quot; and I had no idea I had to ask your permission, individually. Of course, ignorance of the law is no excuse, even for a young child, and now I have to live with the shame and the guilt every day.<p>There are many ways that America&#x27;s schoolchildren have wronged the members of the RIAA and the MPAA. But record companies and the movie industry aren&#x27;t the only ones victimized by school children. Literally millions of school papers are written every year, containing billions of quotations and materials, some quoted at length, and virtually none of those papers asked the original creator for permission.<p>What have we become?",1380484767

6466293,comment,6461936,6465990,1,0,mistercow,,,"I think you&#x27;re conflating latency and bandwidth. The total amount of time spent actually studying a given fact with spaced repetition (to get it in long term memory) is comparable to the amount of time spent studying that fact when cramming for an exam. The difference is that that time is spread over months instead of over a few hours. The bandwidth is roughly equivalent, but the latency is much higher.<p>So if you use SRS effectively, you can actually spend considerably less time studying. If you cram for each test, you&#x27;re essentially crunching a bunch of data into short term memory, forgetting it, and then having to crunch a lot of it back in for the next exam. Then, for the final, you end up having to cram all of it in. Essentially, you&#x27;re paying the cost of short term memorization over and over again, every time you have an exam.<p>If you use SRS and use it daily over the course of the entire semester, you&#x27;ll only pay that cost once. And since you&#x27;ll still have the information in your brain in between exams, your mind will be able to more effectively connect new information to old than if you cram and forget.",1380484678

6466289,comment,6461936,6461936,2,0,espeed,,,"Rethinking the exam structure in US schools to better accommodate and motivate spaced learning would be a significant step toward improving education quality.<p>&#x27;cperciva noted this effect from his time at Oxford...<p>&quot;When I tell North Americans about my time at Oxford University, one aspect of its undergraduate program inevitably surprises them: Final examinations. Rather than writing examinations at the end of each term, students in most subjects write a single set of examinations at the end of their final year, on which their entire degree performance is measured. (In recent years, some subjects have switched to annual examinations.) As terrifying as this might sound, the system has some merits: Whereas many students at institutions with termly examinations study the day before an exam and forget the material the day after the exam, attempting to &#x27;cram&#x27; three years worth of material at once is largely an exercise in futility; as such, Oxford&#x27;s examinations often provide a better measure of how much material a student has learned and retained. Given some of the conversations I&#x27;ve had with  and code I&#x27;ve seen from  people who have received computer science degrees from major universities and are actively working as software developers, I think that last part is very important: There&#x27;s a lot of people out there who have forgotten some very basic  and very important  material&quot; (<a href=""http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2012-10-08-software-development-final-exam.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2012-10-08-software-developm...</a>).<p>You can obviously practice spaced repetition regardless of your school&#x27;s exam structure, and Cal Newport specifies a method for doing this in &quot;The Art of Stealth Studying: How To Earn a 4.0 With Only 1.0 Hours of Work&quot; (<a href=""http://calnewport.com/blog/2007/10/03/the-art-of-stealth-studying-how-to-earn-a-40-with-only-10-hours-of-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calnewport.com/blog/2007/10/03/the-art-of-stealth-stu...</a>).<p>However, most students are unaware of this method nor have the disciple to follow it on their own so to realize its benefits on a mass scale, we would need to revamp the education system around these principles.<p>And as &#x27;qwern noted, sleep is a key factor in spaced repetition learning. Research shows sleep is when the brain prunes itself by separating signal from noise...<p>&quot;Sleep researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health believe it is more evidence for their theory of &#x27;synaptic homeostasis.&#x27; This is the idea that synapses grow stronger when we&#x27;re awake as we learn and adapt to an ever-changing the environment, that sleep refreshes the brain by bringing synapses back to a lower level of strength. This is important because larger synapses consume a lot of energy, occupy more space and require more supplies, including the proteins examined in this study.&quot;<p>&quot;Sleep  by allowing synaptic downscaling  saves energy, space and material, and clears away unnecessary &#x27;noise&#x27; from the previous day, the researchers believe. The fresh brain is then ready to learn again in the morning&quot; (<a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090402143455.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090402143455.ht...</a>).",1380484634

Some of the managers decided that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week. They devised a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.<p>Bill Atkinson, the author of Quickdraw and the main user interface designer, who was by far the most important Lisa implementor, thought that lines of code was a silly measure of software productivity. He thought his goal was to write as small and fast a program as possible, and that the lines of code metric only encouraged writing sloppy, bloated, broken code.<p>He recently was working on optimizing Quickdraw&#x27;s region calculation machinery, and had completely rewritten the region engine using a simpler, more general algorithm which, after some tweaking, made region operations almost six times faster. As a by-product, the rewrite also saved around 2,000 lines of code.<p>He was just putting the finishing touches on the optimization when it was time to fill out the management form for the first time. When he got to the lines of code part, he thought about it for a second, and then wrote in the number: -2000.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how the managers reacted to that, but I do know that after a couple more weeks, they stopped asking Bill to fill out the form, and he gladly complied.&quot;</i>",1380483329

Lots of shut downs, fundraises, acquisitions and chaos that is consolidating user bases in one of the most fragmented industries around.<p>I&#x27;m writing an essay on the subject right now, and I think the biggest problems with productivity software come down to these three things:<p>1) It&#x27;s not just your to do list. Most tools try to make arbitrary distinctions between what is a &quot;to do&quot; vs. what is not when the way that most people operate  and this is often a shocker to people that are into productivity  is just &quot;I need to write SOME thought down for SOME reason LATER.&quot; For example, people might make a &quot;note&quot; that is just &quot;Local Natives&quot; - the name of a band. But isn&#x27;t that representative of a task, &quot;Check out Local Natives&quot;? The lines are blurry, and while most people keep track of tasks in some way, they don&#x27;t really &quot;do&quot; task management consciously.<p>2) No one is getting social right. On the one hand, there&#x27;s Evernote, which deliberately ignores social, and then there&#x27;s email, which is a great way to send things to people but a terrible way to keep track of things for the recipient. In the middle there are collaboration tools, but any project manager can tell you getting everyone to adopt a new system is heinous. IMO, you need to start with and build around the individual first (like Evernote), but tightly integrate a social layer to get those notes and to do&#x27;s to other people on top of it.<p>3) Now what? The author makes an important point about context. Note-taking apps and to do lists have incredibly rich data about people that can be leveraged to actually help deliver that context and guide people through the next step. The next generation of productivity software will be less about helping people stay organized and more about actually helping them execute and get things done.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m the co-founder and CEO of a company in this space called Fetchnotes.

This District has experienced an increase \n  in the number of patent cases filed and tried, notably in the courts of Judge T. John \n  Ward in the Marshall Division, Judge Leonard Davis in the Tyler Division, and Judge \n  David Folsom in the Texarkana Division. Perhaps because the district has a set of \n  local rules for patent cases and relatively fast trial settings, patent plaintiffs \n  have flocked to this small venue. In addition the proximity to larger cities (such \n  as Dallas and Houston) along with an aging jury pool interested in protecting \n  property rights, may attract patent cases to Marshall, Tyler, and Texarkana. [1]\n</code></pre>\nBasically, the judges tend to be friendly to plaintiffs (as is their right as duly appointed federal judges) and the jury pool tend to be in favor of patents and strong property rights.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Texas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_fo...</a>",1380482342

What you&#x27;re suggesting is some <i>additional</i> influence at microscopic scales, and that seems quite implausible to me. (Just how strict are you imagining this rule would be? If two states had phase space volumes in a 51/49 ratio, are you suggesting that the system would <i>always</i> pick the 51?)<p>It&#x27;s hard to list intuitive counterexamples to your suggestion here, since anything intuitive is by definition part of a macroscopic system that would obey the 2nd law anyway.

If no molecular interaction could ever take a system from a larger to a smaller total phase space, then every molecule in an ideal gas should eventually converge to the RMS speed.

These people don&#x27;t have some sense that big bad companies are beating up on little old inventors trying to protect themselves with patents as has been portrayed in the media. These people are generally small minded Jesus followers who can&#x27;t name 20 states outside of Texas and would be hard pressed to remember the name of the Vice President.&quot;<p>Grow up.

8024344,comment,8024241,8024241,5,0,st3fan,,,"Same kind of problems here. I have two VMs. Grabbed them early on, expected them to improve. They did not. Packet loss, slow speed, reboots, kernel panics, filesystems mounted read-only.<p>They made (and are making) lots of other really stupid beginner mistakes too. For example they planted an rc.local script to tune some kernel params to deal with panic regarding filesystem timeouts. Unfortunately that script contained a typo on the very first line and thus was never executed.<p>Combine that with possibly the worst support and messaging int he industry ... still not sure if CloudAtCost is a total scam or just very incompetent.<p>I really wish we had a really awesome VPS provider in Canada. CloudAtCost is not that company.<p>Avoid them.",1405166373

Lack of side effects and lack of low-level mutable shared state protected by locks everywhere are two of the many reasons.<p>Of course, you can write terribly unreadable code in any language, and probably those academic languages with rich functionality and expressiveness make it a little easier to abuse features, or to choose right features for the job.

8024246,comment,8024067,8024067,16,0,Argorak,,,"The about page gives me no idea of what it is, especially as someone who knows TeX quite well. It starts with the single mistake all of those pages do: &quot;It&#x27;s like A, but with B!&quot; On top of that, B is already in A. Typesetting with scripting? LuaTex (actually quite easy, if you know the typesetting surroundings). More layout control? ConTeXt.<p>The biggest hurdle in all those systems is understanding what typesetting actually is (in contrast to content editing or especially programming). It comes with a completely different vocabulary. What&#x27;s a strut?[1] What&#x27;s a quad?[2] What are the standard elements of typography and page layout? How are fonts measured?<p>Finally: how does the system manage forward compatibility (can I still compile my document from 5 years ago?) - scripting and modularity are features that have to be evaluated under all those regards.<p>Also, I am very surprised that code examples in the reference documentation look horrible. Isn&#x27;t that what the system is there for?<p>That said: I love that there is competition in that space. TeX is great and will be around for a few decades, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there can&#x27;t be others.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strut_%28typesetting%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strut_%28typesetting%29</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_%28typography%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_%28typography%29</a>",1405163317

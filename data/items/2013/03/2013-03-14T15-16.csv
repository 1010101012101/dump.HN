My inchoate thoughts:<p>When you study, say, biology, you'll probably learn about all the wrong turns that very smart people made along the road to where we currently stand: self-moving principles in Aristotle; vitalism; spontaneous generation; enzymes as living organism; and many many more. That background gives you a sense of how hard it is to be right, and the importance of modesty and self-doubt.<p>Whereas with computer science, what you learn about is the (relatively short, historically speaking) string of amazing successes in the field. And the more practical side of it (e.g., what software we produce for consumers) is even more unique in having this underlying exponential growth (Moore's law) foisting it up, and drastically changing at every moment what is possible, so that in fact there are very many opportunities that no one thought about simply because they weren't opportunities three years earlier.<p>And then programmers start thinking that, not only is improvement easy in all fields, but also the fact that other fields don't have as much to show for themselves by way of these improvements (whereas they do) just indicates how much better and smarter and innovative they are, and how in light of this it really isn't surprising at all that they may, even as outsiders, have a lot to contribute to any given field.",1363276389

All of them support most or all of the C11 language features.<p>For commercial unixes, it's hard to find documentation on C versions supported by Oracle Solaris Studio, but it was last released in 2011. HPUX ACC was last released in 2010, so I would be very surprised if it supported the 2011 C standard already. That doesn't meant it won't, but it does mean that it moves slowly. Not surprising, since large unix vendors operate in a market where stability is valued above most other things. IBM XLC already supports C11.<p>The embedded market tends to use GCC, from what I can tell, although it may vary widely by company. ArmCC <i>is</i> around, but the last major looks like it was in 2011 (minor updates since).

Whether it was the Higgs mechanism, or some technicolor (strongly-coupled, QCD-like) theory, or something else entirely was not well constrained before the machine turned on.

So the code can look quite pedestrian (e.g. for { } loops where other languages might have other constructs).<p>I believe this to be a win because learning and writing the language are fast. There are some nice 'a ha' moments (such as when you understand interfaces), but mostly the code is (in a good way) boring.<p>It's also a small language. I think it was designed for people who want to get things done, not for people who want to find the cleverest (i.e. least-number-of-characters) way of doing it.<p>The way concurrency is built into the language (based on sequential programming with channel based communication) further reduces the potential complexity. You just write sequential code and let the Go runtime handle the rest.",1363274140

In your case, you are going overboard to show that Protestantism was <i>the</i> driving force behind much of the renaissance (which started well over a century prior the Reformation) and later, the enlightenment, all to support what I find to be a flawed theory on power dynamics.<p>The only argument that will find any support in the sources is that enlightenment-era political and philosophical thought was in some way made possible by a split in the Church. But Descartes and others were highly influential and have little relationship with this. Religious schism had little to no bearing on the sudden development of trade and exploration in the renaissance, both of which opened the New World. And if there was a watershed moment that enabled what would follow, it was clearly the discovery of the Americas, not what Luther had to say.<p>I don't know who you think you are fooling by typing walls of text that subtly, and later overtly, alter your original thesis. I often see these long threads end with ""oh, we really agree!"" and ASCII smiley faces. Abusing history to support some jaded idea you have about the startup scene earns no sympathy from me.",1363273587

I'm a front-end dev -- I write vanilla JavaScript, Backbone, jQuery, as well as CSS3 and semantic HTML (some HTML5). I'm also comfortable with LESS and CoffeeScript. I was recently hired by a SF-based tech company (around 70 employees; $10+ million raised) for a 6-month internship (would become full-time if I chose), and decided to leave because I didn't feel it was the right product for me to be working on right now.<p>Anyway, I'm having a really hard time finding any internships. Start dates don't matter, I'm in SF right now but low on cash because I expected to stay in the job. Heck, the company that hired me didn't even list internships, I just asked the recruiter because he kept bothering me on LinkedIn.<p>So I come to you HN, to ask if any of you would have leads for me. I'm looking for a position that I can grow into and feel comfortable asking questions when I'm stuck. My email address is on my profile if you'd like to contact me privately, and I can send my GitHub profile along with other sample work and a resume.",1363273433

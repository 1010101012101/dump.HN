It's not on the main page, and it's not on the ""Learn more"". This is something very interesting to know though...<p>Also, due to how the web looks in recent years, my mind is trained to ignore anything containing Facebook, Twitter, etc... at the bottom of webpages because it's usually meaningless footer content. However the ""Ratings"" part on your site looks exactly like that. I only discovered the second time that it is content.<p>If more people unconsciously ignore such stuff, you may want to present it in a different way.",1361095159

If your are not yet in a state to write this level of a directive yourself, you still have a few options.

I don't understand how a car traveling 0 mph can have a finite value on that graph if the y-axis is [energy]/[distance].<p>The car expends energy just sitting at zero MPH -- the computer and lights, air conditioning and heating, things like that. So the graph is correct -- there is an energy expenditure to ""go"" zero miles per hour.<p>> I was hoping the units were [Watts][hours]/[minutes] or something to make everything better.<p>When the speed is zero, it stops mattering which units it's expressed in. :)",1361094716

5234743,comment,5234375,5234724,3,0,lutusp,,,"> Not sure how Tesla does that (if it does 'engine braking')<p>Tesla uses the electric motors that normally propel the car by expending battery energy, but ""in reverse"" to generate a small amount of power while decelerating. It's better than nothing, but it's not as efficient as many people seem to believe.<p>> And of course that's negated by the fact that you'll be going uphill in the way back, using more energy<p>Good example -- going downhill with your foot on the brake, recovers 20% of the car's kinetic energy lost by descending the hill. Going uphill again requires 100%$ of the required energy from the battery. So it's a net loss of 80% of the total energy represented by climbing and then descending the hill.",1361094315

I think the OP is making a valid point, and I'd like to throw my $0.02 in support.<p>Look, there are two crowds in Silicon Valley. First are the people who seem to collect connections almost as if it was some sort of competetive sport. They know everyone, they join every social network and have thousands of friends, they go through a full box of business cards in three days, attend every networking event imaginable,  entrepreneurship seminars, startup parties, meetups, hackathons, you name it... I admire their social skills, but I'm barely aware of what they actually do outside of growing their networks - all they talk about are the events they've been to and people they've met.<p>The second crowd actually builds things. They are of course doing some networking, but they seem to stick to the essential minimum and don't play the ""who's got the fattest rolodex"" game. They also seem to somehow know each other, but not the people from the first group :)<p>Of course connections are valuable. But not so much if the only thing you build is your network!",1361094283

Being able to process more than one request at a time on each node should alleviate wait times and bottle-necks, even with a simple e.g. round-robin routing layer. It might not be the absolute optimum, but it could still provide a pretty good / good enough balance.<p>As a side note about the overload scenario you mentioned - It's very interesting to consider, but we can easily get dragged into Denial-of-Service territory, and designing against DoS is an even harder problem in my opinion (until you considered handling 'normal' load anyway).",1361094099

At least when I was studying it was all about, ""Get your kid to do Engineering/Medicine and then every thing will take care of itself"".<p>There is a big reason for this. Uneducated people get played for easily and there is that huge disadvantage in non-knowledge driven based jobs. Take for example the job of a cab/bus driver. Or some body like mason, the problem the money you earn is directly related to number or hours/quantity of work you get delivered. And since quantity is largely related to a physical activity in this case. It means you will do a lot of physical labor to earn more money. This is not scalable and becomes blatantly clear to a lot of people involved in this. Add to this that these kinds of jobs don't get much social respect.<p>My dad was a bus driver. And I know what it was for me as a kid. It was always to study my ass off or be doomed. And yes all other standard social problems apply. You are always considered poor and assumed to remain such till eternity. No one likes knowing that he being a educated white collar knowledge worker, his kids and the kids of a bus driver ultimately get the same destiny. I even had problems getting married. Coming from a low financial background creates big problems. People find it hard to accept if you win, and pass sympathies if you don't.<p>So the only way remains: Study and fight your way out of the situation.<p>My teenage through early 20's was the most stressful phase of my life. Because failure was not an option. No money to do business, So if I fail it will going back to same life.<p>I'm not saying life is rosy as a programmer. It has its own problems both financial and in other aspects of life. But yet its far better than what I saw in early parts of my life(Nothing I will tell you, can explain you what it feels to be in that place- I only hope no other kid goes through that). I don't feel sad that I can't buy an iPhone. But rather its satisfying to know I don't have break my back just to eat, wear clothes and live under a roof.<p>Its still same here in India for a large number of people. Education and a white collar job doesn't fix all problems. But it does fix enough problems in your life to make it livable.",1361093188

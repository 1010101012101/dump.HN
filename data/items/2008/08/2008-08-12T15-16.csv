You have a lot of different slots, you pour water into each one, and then you put it away in the freezer. A little while later you come back, and some of the ice cubes are frozen all the way through. Some are still full of water. You get both kinds of cubes. The real trick is telling the difference between them. On the surface they both look like fully frozen ice cubes. But the improperly frozen ones have bubbles that move, and the fully frozen ones have bubbles that stay still. You can't tell just by looking at them. The only way to tell the difference is to shake the tray.<p>Shake the tray. Find the fully frozen cubes.",1218556767

If it gratifies my intellectual curiosity then maybe it will other users' as well. That said, I think it's personally important to use votes as community feedback for my future posts.<p>If anything, I worry about a community that becomes too homogeneous because interestingness involves variability. All I can do here is submit links. Whether it's interesting to the community is up to the community to decide (expressed in votes and comments). For instance, I'm often provoked by David Brooks (NY Times columnist). But he doesn't ever really talk about computers or business. Initially, I was skeptical about posting one of his columns. But it was received well and so I posted more.<p>This article was borderline for me. But what's the worst that can happen? It doesn't get votes? So I'd rather shade toward posting than not while still keeping the guidelines firmly in mind. I've often been surprised that the community appreciates some links that don't ""belong"" on a superficial analysis. Similarly, I've enjoyed science, law, art, and even political articles linked here (the last in small doses). I think that's a good thing. A uniform community is a boring one.",1218556639

In the effort to get the product to market, they neglected documenting the requirements of the billing portion.  Over time, because of the requirements of our each of customers were different (depending on what entity they billed, the rules for the billing were different), the application turned into a mess of stuff that was never well-documented (fortunately, I didn't work on the billing app).

He doesn't even lay down rules about how you should build <i>any</i> site. He's all about carrying out user testing. He suggests techniques that he thinks are likely to work, but he always qualifies these opinions.<p>What I find particularly irritating about Hank's blog post is that he seems to me to be saying ""useit is ugly"" rather more than he is saying ""useit is unusable"" - the latter if provable is relevant, but Jakob's articles are not about beauty - only usability.",1218553608

Was it all mediocre and ""not entirely what they wanted""?<p>This is the entire reason for systems analysis and requirements specification.  You don't need to do any of this for the software you're writing for yourself.  You must do all of it and do it well when writing software for others; that's how you <i>insure</i> that it's exactly what they want.",1218553420

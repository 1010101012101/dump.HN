You could have hypothesized a ""dark"" force that moved the planets. Or you could hypothesize that a force you already know exists (gravity near the Earth's surface) also exists for each body of the solar system, has unlimited range, and follows an inverse square law.",1313348340

Yes, the lines may be shorter, and the store needs fewer checkers (one can cover multiple self-check lanes), so the store is saving money. But I feel a loss in service quality and am not convinced my checkout time (waiting + service) has been shortened.<p>So, yes, it's more efficient for the _store_, but not for _me_ as a customer.<p>Maybe that's what you're sayingthere are two sides to efficiency. Corporations maximize it for themselves, sometimes at the expense of customers.

It starts out by talking about the Pentagon's refocusing on the Pacific rim and why such a refocusing is necessary. It says that Beijing identifies the US as a threat, rather than a partner.  Right after that, however, the article contradicts itself. It says that Beijing is <i>not</i> a threat; Beijing's pronouncements regarding the South China Sea have been misinterpreted and in reality they mean us no harm.<p>So which is it? Is Beijing a real threat to the freedom of the seas in the South China Sea? Or is Washington overreacting to innocuous statements?

We focused on absolute excellence and did pretty well.  I thought I knew what I was doing on the business side.<p>But then 2008 arrived and suddenly all that discretionary money just evaporated (in our market, anyway).  It was humbling. We were not prepared, we didn't really understand our business model nor our market. What we thought was business savvy and prosperity was actually just dumb luck and it ran out.<p>In the years afterward, I discovered books like ""The Four Steps to the Epiphany"" and feel much better positioned.

2884168,comment,2883421,2884110,4,0,wzdd,,,"Thank you for the response! I was quite disappointed with the downvotes.<p>The examples you give do not convince me that my statement, ""this only works because it is novel"", is not correct. People obey traffic signals out of habit and / or fear that there may in fact be someone around (and even if they didn't, it would be out of concern for safety, nothing to do with this give-some-get-some principle); the ""pay what you want"" restaurant in London was a month-long promotion (and it now charges again), and many other incarnations struggle (see this NY Times article for information on several failed versions of the scheme: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/us/21free.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/us/21free.html</a>); the vast majority of church funding (millions of dollars!) does not come from collection plates, and, even if it did, collection plates are dissimilar to this example because everybody watches what you do with the plate -- the social cost of stealing is far more obvious and pronounced (and, unlike Jonathan's Card, taking from a collection plate is unequivocally stealing, making the example even less relevant); and, finally, if there are musicians who make ""a decent living"" out of selling free music (as opposed to a profitable sideline) then I don't know of any. One counter example is Radiohead's ""In Rainbows"", where 62% of the people downloading paid nothing at all (see: <a href=""http://www.globalnerdy.com/2008/10/16/radioheads-in-rainbows-experiment-was-a-success/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalnerdy.com/2008/10/16/radioheads-in-rainbows...</a>). The album still made money, due to Radiohead's brand power, but they have not continued the experiment with new albums.<p>There are no good examples of a Jonathan's Card-type scheme working for any length of time in the real world.<p>The problem with the response in general, and I think your response in particular as well, is this quote from you:<p>> If the idea isn't strangled in its crib by a wise-ass.<p>The very fact that the idea <i>was</i> strangled in its crib by a wise-ass, coupled with the dearth of similar ideas out there in the real world, seems to demonstrate fairly well that this is not a good idea.<p>You then give a bunch of examples of <i>expensive technology</i> which eventually became cheap technology (stockings, the Internet, cars, etc). This is a completely unrelated to Jonathan's card -- nobody is going to deny that expensive technologies become cheaper and, in doing so, benefit more people! However, Jonathan's card doesn't rely on expensive technology -- it relies on all participants being altruistic. And in the real world, given a sufficiently large number of participants, not all of them will be altruistic. Jonathan's Card is particularly bad in this respect because one ""wise-ass"" can take so much value from the system -- contrast this with a hypothetical successful musician putting her album online, where the worst that a single defector can do is take the album for free.",1313347696

It's that ideas are very powerful.<p>Actually what we should learn is that ideas are powerful and especially dangerous if they are combined with a general lack of information and alternative viewpoints as was the case in the first half of the 20th century.<p>You are incorrect in stating that Nazism was not primarily idea driven. The whole ""nationalism"" thing started off as a powerful idea in the early 19th century spearheaded by the Romanticist zeitgeist. Previously, people imagined their ""tribes"" as consisting of their immediate family, relatives, and perhaps friendly neighbors. Europe consisted of multiethnic empires at the time. With the rise of nationalist ideas, people started to imagine their tribes as all people speaking the same language and being of the same ""race"". Also, don't forget the ""socialist"" part in Nazism, which was also idea-driven. I recommend watching ""The Goebbels Experiment"" (IMDB: <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458375/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458375/</a>) to get a hint on how significant the idea-driven propaganda/brainwashing was in the rise of Nazism.<p>The nationalist wave started off somewhere in Central Europe and reached other parts of the continent much later -- it is still causing trouble in Russia (the surprising rise of neo-Nazi skinheads there with the fall of the USSR), Northern Ireland, the Balkans, and the Basque Country in Spain, for example.",1313347367

There are restaurants that let you ""pay whatever you want""; there are musicians that make a decent living selling music that one can get for free either from them or from third parties. People obey traffic signals even when nobody is around to enforce them. Churches survive despite the option of stealing from the collection plate as it goes by. So this sort of thing <i>can</i> work and in many places <i>does</i> work. The main question here is whether one can establish a social norm that encourages more cooperation than defection. For that to work, defection has to garner shame and social disapproval. Hence the reaction you see here.<p>> about a card that lets rich people buy overpriced coffee for other rich people! (And let's be completely clear, if you are in the position either to use Jonathan's card or have it used for you, you are almost certainly quite well-off.)<p>The exact thing being shared is irrelevant to the principles involved because if you got it work, it could <i>scale</i>. Something that <i>starts</i> by providing the public good of coffee-sharing might grow to provide other public goods. If the idea isn't strangled in its crib by a wise-ass.<p>Related analogy: <i>the internet</i> might once have best been described as something that <i>""lets overeducated rich people talk to other overeducated rich people!

But because the people who used it benefited back then, <i>everyone</i> benefits today. Almost <i>every</i> new innovation helps ""the rich"" or well-connected before it helps the masses. At the time silk stockings were invented, the queen of england was among the few who could afford them. TVs were only for rich people when they were invented; ditto VCRs, radios, microwave ovens, cars...

USPS does it cheaply, so bulk mailers use them.  I don't know the rules and regs, I'm not actually sure the USPS has it within their control to white list actual mail.<p>I'm proposing a different service -- my main point being that because of who the USPS is, they'd have an enormous natural advantage to offer that type of whitelisted new service. The fact that its a no brainer and that nobody has done it probably means it is hard, more than anything. But it seems it would be easier for someone with the reach and institutional trust of a quasi govt organization (compared to a startup).<p>Perhaps the USPS would be more likely to do a better job in curtailing their reliance on bulk mailings if they had an exploding, high margin revenue base around ecommerce payment and being a more trusted, secure form of business communications channels.  Mail spam sucks, but that is their revenue base.  From their point of view, as an institution, they of course would like to see it replaced, institutions don't themselves like to generally just commit suicide.<p>Tech is what is going to replace them, at least attempting to transition to tech while leveraging what advantages they do have isn't a terrible idea -- because there quite possibly are some things they are able to uniquely bring to the table.",1313344825

Python&#x27;s CSV module supports a &quot;strict&quot; mode that will yell at you more often, but by default, it is disabled. When disabled, the parser will greatly prefer <i>a parse</i> over a <i>correct</i> parse. I took the same route with my CSV parser in Rust (with the intention of adding a strict mode later), because that&#x27;s by far the most useful implementation. There&#x27;s nothing more annoying then trying to slurp in a CSV file from somewhere and having your CSV library choke on it.",1412160588

Both of those are every day events that happen to everyone.   Until phones get to the point at which they can routinely handle both (neither of which any iPhone has ever been able to do), they come up lacking.<p>In addition, a phone should certainly not deform that much if it sits in a reasonable pocket.<p>On the flip side - I&#x27;m not expecting my phone to handle 200 pounds of force by me sitting on it on a hard surface repeatedly, particularly if there is hard edge/corner involved (which greatly increases the PSI the device has to handle).

Business logic isolated from external systems can run <i>incredibly</i> fast, so ten seconds worth of testing can mean an awful lot in that case.

Nobody&#x27;s packets are dropped at that time of day.<p>The problem with QoS is that the window where it&#x27;s actually useful is miniscule. If, on the one hand, it&#x27;s 2AM and nobody is using the network, QoS does nothing because all the packets are delivered and none are dropped. On the other hand, if everybody is trying to watch the Superbowl at the same time and $STREAM_BPS * $NUM_USERS > $TOTAL_BANDWIDTH, QoS can&#x27;t save you. You have more time-sensitive traffic than you have pipe to put it in, so at least some of your customers are going to see choppy video (or no video).<p>In the middle of that you have this tiny slice where the network is saturated &quot;just right&quot; for QoS to actually do something. You have only just enough bandwidth to handle all of the active streams, so that when some bursty thing (like loading a large web page) comes along, you can drop some packets from a stream and have just enough bandwidth available two seconds later to let the stream catch up before the client&#x27;s buffer is exhausted.<p>To skip to the punch line, that never happens. Networks that hit 100% utilization on a regular basis are under-provisioned. If you&#x27;re at the point where QoS helps you do something, your network is broken, because tomorrow&#x27;s peak usage could be higher than today&#x27;s which means you needed to start upgrading yesterday. QoS on the Internet is useless.<p>And that&#x27;s before you get to the whole trouble with what to do about ssh tunnels and TLS connections and otherwise unclassifiable traffic.",1398790483

7668231,comment,7667068,7667918,3,0,saurik,,,"Earth Class Mail does this. They offer real street addresses as opposed to &quot;PO boxes&quot;, so you don&#x27;t run into a lot of the issues you are describing. The only thing that occasionally is a problem (but like, once in a blue moon, and usually related to buying a new iPhone) is the issue with &quot;having a physical good sent to an address other than my billing address&quot;. However, while I&#x27;ve usually been able to just temporarily change my upstream AT&T address for just the day to make my order, ECM also solves this problem: you can have physical packages delivered to your ECM street address and then have the product forwarded or even go pick it up in person the same day (I live two hours away from ECM, so I&#x27;m unlikely to do this often, but I technically can in a pinch).<p>I have my ECM address on my drivers license (I didn&#x27;t even ask the DMV to do this for me: I simply listed ECM as my mailing address, and that&#x27;s the address that their policy puts on the card; I verified with them afterwards there was no mistake or misunderstanding), and have had no issues with moving my bank accounts and credit cards to my ECM service. The only people who know my physical address are utilities (though my bills actually do get sent correctly to ECM), health insurance (as the pricing is dependent on your location), and the US government (voting registration and DMV filing, though neither ever sends mail to anything but ECM).<p>That all said, your specific use case is somewhat different: you need the utilities to also send you bills, and they are some of the few people who actually care about having your physical address. But it isn&#x27;t like Outbox could really solve this in a sane way for you either... that would involve them going through the mail of the people who are renting from you, only once every three days (so assuming your renters didn&#x27;t reap the mail first), and pulling just the mail being delivered to &quot;you&quot; as opposed to them. If I were renting from you I&#x27;d frankly find that kind of sketch. For what misterbwong and forgottenpass are talking about, however: ECM is specifically the service they are looking for ;P.",1398790297
7668230,comment,7667976,7667976,52,0,birken,,,"Let&#x27;s think about this logically.  Google takes 32% of every adsense click [1], so assuming an account makes $5,000/month, Google is making $2,352/month from that account.  So by banning the account, they are making $5,000 one-time, and losing $2,352/month forever.  No company is stupid enough to do that.<p>However, considering a site making $5,000 or $10,000/month is generating quite a few clicks, I think it makes perfect sense for any account reaching these thresholds to be manually reviewed to ensure they are valid sites.  The quality of Google&#x27;s clicks is one of its main selling points, and by cutting out spammy sites at the source it both improves the quality of its own program and at the same time removes a lot of the financial incentive to run a scummy site.<p>So my guess is these policies (or similar policies that involve manual reviews of sites) make perfect sense, are not illegal in any way, and this whole posting is as bogus as it looks.<p>1: <a href=""https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/180195?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/180195?hl=en</a>",1398790294

If the same exact study is done 100 times, but only the best 50 results get included in your study, a meta analysis of those results is going to show a strong statistical bias.  No amount of waving around the word &quot;Bayesian&quot; can fix this - the only way to fix it is pre-registration of honest results.<p>Why am I so certain of this?  Because of the following passage:<p><i>By my count, Bem follows all of the commandments except [6] and [10]. He apologizes for not using pre-registration, but says it’s okay because the studies were exact replications of a previous study that makes it impossible for an unsavory researcher to change the parameters halfway through and does pretty much the same thing.</i><p>But that misses the whole point.  Whether the studies had the same or different parameters is irrelevant - the fact that you see the ones that worked out and don&#x27;t see the ones that didn&#x27;t is the only thing that matters.

Would it be &quot;fair&quot; for roommate A to to pay no more than $215 - $135 =  $80/month more than the others, when their ability to pay is so much greater?<p>That&#x27;s obviously a contrived example, but not too different from my own situation. I&#x27;m a consultant / business owner whose income is not extravagant, but is reasonably above the UK mean. I have a flatmate -- who is fact a student artist -- who contributes roughly 20% of the total costs to the household, including utility & council taxes and whatnot. An 80/20 split may sound terribly inequitable, but we&#x27;re both paying a similar percentage of our earnings for rent, so it&#x27;s quite equitable from that perspective.<p>Absent this arrangement, I could still afford to live on my own, but I&#x27;d be left with less cash at the end of the month, and my place would seem a bit empty. My flatmate, in turn, could probably only afford to live in some tiny squalid place far from the city centre. If we were to insist on a 50/50 split which is &quot;fair&quot; from the perspective of the space & utilities (rather than from the perspective our respective pocketbooks), then no accommodation could be found: my flatmate could never afford to pay half the rent. But by optimising around a <i>subjectively</i> fair allocation of our personal resources and preferences, I get an excellent flatmate and more spending money, and they get a much nicer place in London than they could otherwise afford. This is a far better outcome for both of us than we could achieve by insisting on an &quot;objectively fair&quot; split.<p>As for your chores dilemma: just have a basic rule about not leaving one&#x27;s personal crap in the common areas. Then for the routine tasks (vacuuming, mopping, etc.), collect an extra $5/week from everybody, and use that money to hire a professional cleaner (or if one of the flatmates is short of cash and particularly good at / enthusiastic about cleaning, pay them to do it). Seriously, it&#x27;s worth it. People have vastly different capabilities and preferences when it comes to cleaning, and trying to make everybody equal in this respect is an un-winnable game. Don&#x27;t even try.<p>tl;dr: the less you strive for egalitarianism through uniformity, and the more you accommodate the divergent abilities and subjective viewpoints of your flatmates, the better you&#x27;ll be able to find win/win scenarios in shared-living situations.",1398789689
7668152,comment,7662190,7667944,3,0,deveac,,,"<i>>Feminism was originally about equality (e.g. suffragettes for voting law, domestic violence law) but it has exceeded its mandate long ago and become primarily a tool to secure legal advantages for women.</i><p>Again, that is not what feminism is or means. That&#x27;s more of a re-definition of the word to support a personal assertion.<p><i>>A true &quot;humanism&quot; or &quot;equalism&quot; would seem to keep things fair for both men and women.</i><p>You&#x27;re absolutely right here. This is why you see fewer and fewer colleges offering classes in &#x27;feminism&#x27; anymore. Of course, the classes are still being offered and the content is the same, but the programs are now called &#x27;Gender Studies&#x27; increasingly, to reflect the very notion you are describing.<p>A close friend of mine is a got her PhD from Rutgers and has taught gender studies at a variety of universities over the decades. Looking at the entire body of feminist philosophy and output over the years, a central truth that her work and the work of many of her peers seems to reveal in talking with them over the years is that when you abstract their philosophy to its very core, all that you are left with is equality. And it goes beyond equality for both men and women as you say, but for all genders and eccentricities as well. If I had a dollar for each time I&#x27;ve heard a feminist talk about how there was not much difference between their discipline and say, African American studies, or Native American studies I&#x27;d be rich, because at the core of each of these disciplines is a quest for tolerance and equity.<p>But wrapped around this core is the study of the <i>history</i> of the treatment of these classes over time. There are attempts to measure the degree to which equality was present. And based off of that, there is <i>activism to achieve</i> equality where common sense and/or measured study revealed it to be lacking.<p>It is this last part, the <i>action</i> or <i>activism</i> that gives people the most problems I think. The setting out to &#x27;set things right&#x27;. It is here that tempers flare, lines are crossed, and toes get stepped on. Here is where people disagree where the lines should be, and here is where <i>some</i> people make the claim that feminism has gone too far and isn&#x27;t about equality but actually about grabbing special treatment and privilege. They&#x27;ve achieved equality in their past efforts and now they want <i>more than that</i>.<p>I get why people feel that way. The activism is the hardest because society doesn&#x27;t agree on what victory through equality looks like. You see it with women&#x27;s rights, minority rights, and religious rights every single day in my country.<p>But any feminist who deserves the name will tell you that it&#x27;s a big umbrella, and activism is only one part of it, and it is really the <i>result</i> of the study of gender and it affects people&#x27;s place in our society. Make no mistake, -feminism IS about equality, both by definition of the word and in practice in the field of study when you look at it as a whole. Don&#x27;t get too hung up on its application by some actors under a large umbrella. Most feminists I know would be right on board with your definition of humanism and equalism, again, it&#x27;s the very reason the names of the programs have been changing over time.",1398789687

Apparently conflicting results without a methodological error in either imply that the explanatory model that appears to be supported by at least one of the results (if not both) is, while useful within its own domain, in some way incorrect.<p>The whole idea that the models validated by scientific experimentation are binarily true of false is, well, missing the point badly.

There&#x27;s a lot of hypotheses without models and some experiments testing them, which (concerns about methodology aside, for the moment) might raise interesting questions and serve as inspiration for developing and then testing theoretical models to explain the effects, but very little has been done there -- which makes &quot;parapsychology&quot; more a collection of potentially unexplained phenomena more than a branch of science that provides an explanatory model for some set of phenomena.<p>Which is <i>very</i> different from most of the social sciences.",1398788543

This has been demonstrated throughout history in human interactions with each other (via religion, politics, legal systems), the development of science and technology (see Galileo, Copernicus, the 19th century US doctors ignoring germ theory and killing a president).<p>Sometimes we create dogmas to try and move things away from bad ideas towards better ideas. Dijkstra&#x27;s &quot;Go To Considered Harmful&quot; was one such effort. Gotos, as used at the time, were fucking terrible. They were used instead of higher level expressions like if/then/else, for, do/while, function calls. But the (at the time I was in college, early 2000s) refrain was tired and wrong (or misapplied). Sometimes, in some languages gotos can, in fact, be very useful, so long as their use is chosen deliberately and with care (see the C idiom of using gotos to jump to error handling/reporting code in functions).<p>In the end, nearly every development process runs the risk of becoming a dogma.

So why can&#x27;t we draw the conclusion that parapsychology is as legitimate as other branches of science? What is to separate it?<p>I would offer a pseudo-Bayesian[1] answer to that question. Parapsychology aims to prove hypotheses that lacks theoretical foundations. Our current understanding of physics and biology weigh strongly against the existence of psychic phenomena. Even before any experiment is conducted, we must admit that psychic phenomena are unlikely to exist. Our experimental results must be evaluated in light of that prior probability.<p>Thus, parapsychology is and should be held to a higher burden of proof than other branches of science. We should demand more rigorous experimental designs, stronger effects, and smaller p values.

7667942,comment,7667068,7667068,62,0,saurik,,,"If someone wants a service like this, in my opinion Earth Class Mail is a better alternative. They are not in any way &quot;hip&quot; or &quot;web 2.0&quot; and they would never in a million years talk about &quot;disrupting&quot; some established legal regime: but frankly, I&#x27;m not just &quot;ok&quot; with that, that makes me ecstatic. I thereby see this &quot;how the post office killed digital mail&quot;, a dream I&#x27;ve been successfully living now for years through one of their &quot;less disruptive&quot; competitors, and can do nothing but laugh.<p>Instead, Earth Class Mail is a service that has been in business since 2006 and they operate within the existing legal framework of mail: they are effectively the kind of service that is required to live in an RV, where a third-party receives your mail on your behalf. To make this work, you sign forms <i>from the post office</i> that you send to Earth Class Mail, which are then kept on file to demonstrate they can legally open your mail. Maybe Outbox used the same process, maybe they didn&#x27;t, but this article made it sound like Outbox is responsible for this legal framework: wrong, the ability to assign &quot;open my mail&quot; rights has existed for a long time.<p>Rather than having to have cars driving around attempting to &quot;undeliver&quot; your mail with some ludicrous three-day delay as Outbox did (at extreme cost to the service that calls into question whether their business model would even succeed, a fact mentioned in this article linked today, and limiting them to only even being able to think about operating in high-density regions of the country), you simply have your mail delivered to them. You can initially set this up with your local post office as you work on &quot;moving&quot; to ECM, and you can even do it temporarily if you just want to try it out (the post office will happily forward mail for as little as 15 days: again, this is a use case they actively support).<p>But frankly it is so amazingly relaxing once you &quot;commit&quot; and outsource your physical address. I have a lot of friends that move every couple years, and the idea that they have to change their address at the same time is silly: that is the most stressful moment to be trying to move mail delivery and you can&#x27;t usually overlap the old and new addresses to buffer mistakes. In the most extreme situations, people who are traveling a lot (for whatever reason; maybe they have a job that requires them to be in random locations for weeks on end a lot, or maybe they are just kind of nomadic and stay with friends a lot as they travel the country) will tell you to send things to their current location. Outbox sort of helped with this, but the three-day delay sounded really irritating: ECM just solves this problem outright; you don&#x27;t even need a real physical address at all.<p>Indeed, I seriously have now switched to using my Earth Class Mail address for everything: my drivers license even has that address on it (and yes, I verified with the people at the California DMV that there was no issue with this, and they technically do have my physical address on file; but their policy is to print the mailing address of the driver on the card), which makes it really easy for me to never get into an argument with anyone about what my address is: I effectively now live at Earth Class Mail in Los Angeles. The only people who know my real address are the US government (DMV and voting registration, though they happily send my voting materials to ECM), the power/cable/phone services to my apartment (again, bills go to ECM), and my health insurance company (they base pricing on where you physically reside).<p>They offer multiple locations around the country, so you can get an address vaguely near you or opt for one that &quot;looks good&quot; for your purpose (maybe you want your startup to look like it has an office in San Francisco, for example). With some of the addresses they are legitimate &quot;street addresses&quot; that can receive packages on your behalf, and you can either have the package forwarded to you or you can go pick it up from them if you need it <i>now</i> and live near enough to the location. (Though, with packages, I normally just one-off deliver those to my apartment.) (I wonder if you can have them open the package and take a picture of the contents... I never asked ;P.)",1398787784

And that may very well be the case - anecdotally, you&#x27;ll have more eyeball-time on that colorful supermarket ad lying on your counter than you will on an email-like message that you&#x27;ll immediately delete. And additionally, there&#x27;s the coupon use case which allocates existing customers&#x27; interest to overstocked items. Coupons can go digital, of course, and you can surface ads in a Gmail-like interface, but there&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg problem: until the average shopper replaces their entire remember-to-go-shopping workflow with a digital one, there will still be utility from physically delivered coupons and advertisements. I&#x27;d even argue that at a national scale, junk mail promotes consumer spending (vs. saving) in an economically significant way by alerting people to limited-time offers.<p>So even if the Post Office were to operate digitization and digital delivery themselves, and access all of the revenue from hosting digital advertisements, if the assumptions above are correct, it would be the &quot;same slice of a smaller pie,&quot; since conversions could drop in aggregate.

10104376,comment,10103468,10103596,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> in terms of science, technology and programming , civil liberties<p>Well if you look at nobel prize winners (scientific, too), most are from the EU, not the US. Based on population levels they&#x27;re roughly the same. If you look at top internet companies then yes, Google, Apple etc are in the US. But I think we have to consider that a lot of that is because of network effects.<p>For example, some of the best football in the world is in Spain right now. But on the pitch at Barcelona the top 3 players (of arguably the most successful team the past decade) you find one player from Argentine, a player from Brazil and a player from Uruguay, playing a style of football introduced by a Dutch player and trainer, and it&#x27;s not exceptional in this regard. If you look at the world cup however (teams of native players) you find that Spain won only once and very recently, while Brazil won 5 times. Yet all the top players from Brazil come to Europe. The net result is that Spain has terrific football, yet isn&#x27;t responsible for the majority of the talent or tactics, and other countries like Brazil or the Netherlands are net suppliers of talent to countries like Spain.<p>I feel the US, Silicon Valley mostly, is very similar, it attracts all the talent, but that&#x27;s different from saying that it&#x27;s responsible for it. (just like in the above example with Spain who is a net receiver of talent, and becomes the talent capital of the world within football, without doing anything particularly special outside of network effects).<p>For example, look at the CEO of Microsoft and Google, both India born, partially India educated. SV attracts them, but isn&#x27;t necessarily responsible for them. You may use that as an argument that SV somehow is geared towards innovation better. But I think you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to identify any big forces outside of network effects. In very direct ways we can see it with e.g. Skype being bought by Microsoft (a swedish company), or a guy like Linus Torvalds doing the vast majority of his work from his native Finland and deciding in his 40s only a few years ago to move to the US.<p>Beyond that I think we fail to sometimes put the achievements in perspective. You mentioned Google and Apple etc, but if you look at the fortune 500 for example you find in 2015 that China had 3 companies in the top 10, the US had 2. In the Fortune 500 all together the US had 128 companies, China 106 and rapidly growing (they had just 10 in 2000 when the US had 180). UK-France-Germany, a combined population of just 210 million people, has almost 100 places in the Fortune 500. Add Japan to get to a population of the US, and you&#x27;re ahead of the US in spots on the fortune 500.<p>I mean you mention Apple and it&#x27;s an absolutely wonderful company on whose hardware I&#x27;m typing now, but my machine is loaded with parts from third parties who drive a ton of the innovation, too, like Samsung parts, a company whose revenue is much bigger than that of Apple. And we&#x27;re seeing genuine innovation from China, too, like WeChat (there was a thread on this recently).<p>Anyway I&#x27;m rambling on with lots of examples and anecdotal evidence. I don&#x27;t really like it as there&#x27;s a lot of counter anecdotes to present. But I think there&#x27;s a case to be made that the US isn&#x27;t any better or better structured or more competitive, but benefits from tremendous network effects still, and that this is more and more being contested by the rest of the world. We&#x27;re seeing a wave of new companies that don&#x27;t feel the need to move to the US to commercialise the product, or to find themselves in a startup hub, or to be able to network with financiers. From startups like Spotify who&#x27;re comfortable staying in Sweden or like WeChat in China, to the biggest companies in the world, both the traditional (e.g. utilities) to the more innovative (e.g. Samsung). Sure I pick Apple any day, but I can easily pick a load of non-US companies that innovate more than say Yahoo. Not to mention it depends on the industry, too. A ton of innovation in e.g. automotive or renewables is in Europe or Asia. And we&#x27;re seeing markets being addressed that I don&#x27;t think the US is geared to address, like Xiaomi in China and India, which are becoming increasingly more important.<p>As for civil liberties, a loooong road to go for China, but no big deal in e.g. the European Union. The US doesn&#x27;t lead the world in civil liberties. For example the Economist intelligence unit does an annual ranking, the US came in 19th last year. But better than 2010 it came in last place of all &#x27;full democracies&#x27; in place 46.",1440291325

First, we&#x27;ve come to a crossroads in cosmology [0] where some heavy hitters are rebelling and saying time is real and mathematics is a too-comfortable approximation. Second is a new foundation for mathematics that moves away from set theory to a fusion of type theory and homotopy theory called univalence [1].<p>It is these kinds of events that permit the scales to fall from our eyes and show us more of the things we didn&#x27;t know we didn&#x27;t know.

It&#x27;s very difficult to move from note to note, and extremely difficult to stay in tune, especially in a setting with large numbers of people around, who, when they move, will change the tuning. Yet it is primarily played by people who see it as a fun toy, or simply don&#x27;t practice much. For some reason, with the theremin, perhaps because it&#x27;s an interesting instrument in itself, people find it alright to perform on it while completely unqualified to do so.<p>No one&#x27;s going to go toy around with a violin for a few weeks and then insist on performing. Or at least, if they do, no one is going to blame the violin for the results.<p>Nonetheless, as some examples, people like Clara Rockmore, Lydia Kavina, and Carolina Eyck all perform very well for technical, difficult pieces, and Randy George does a good job with more modern, popular pieces.",1440291073

Since everything is in Python, data can be generated easily, results can be plotted using well known Python tools which simplified debugging.

Stress is completely subjective, and so is its effect on mental health. Lots of animals in the wild have a much more supposedly stressful life but curl up and die in captivity where everything is provided for. I would say the experience that we have with work is similar subjectively regardless of modern convenience.

Even most plane flights are auto-piloted and even auto-land, so I believe that drones are a lot closer in terms of implementation than self-driving cars.<p>If there is a business case that determines that drones, while being potentially more energy-intensive, can save a company money due to speed, I believe it will win.

The economy was reasonable, and the kids learned a lot of very basic economic ideas.  Neopets was pretty good, &quot;do Internet with the kids&quot; time.  We would figure the site out, make plans, do stuff, make friends.  Honestly, for a family experience, it was damn tough to beat Neopets!  And the marketing worked.  We bought a fair number of these damn pets, which the cats would shred, and we would buy more, etc...  pure gold for somebody, somewhere.<p>Then something happened.<p>We were running shops.  Everybody did.  You put stuff in your shop and you try and sell it for more than you paid for it.  A common item was lottery tickets.  Get one, don&#x27;t scratch it off, and sell it.<p>People really liked scratching these to win, and distribution was limited enough that they were always in demand.  For a good price somewhere between ticket cost and the potential pay off, they sold quick!<p>The competition for neopoints reached a peak, and we were all going for it.  So then I did something I still feel bad about...<p>Turns out, there was some latency in pricing updates in the shops.  Mostly didn&#x27;t matter, but on a high demand item that would sell quickly, it did matter.  It could matter a lot.<p>I put a lottery ticket in the shop for 1800 neopoints, say.  It gets purchased in seconds.  Cool.  Paid 600.<p>I do another one, decide to change my mind, and I changed the price.  It also sold, and in fact was sold before I could get the page refresh to even confirm the edit, but it sold for the edited price, and the buyer never would know, until after the transaction completed.<p>The question became, &quot;just how many neopoints are people walking around with?&quot;<p>There were banks, with interest, etc...  People who used them could get a nice income stream going, but I noticed not too many people used them, so...<p>I list a lottery ticket for the low price of 888!  Going rate was about double that, and the cost of the ticket was 600.  Sure sale.  Won&#x27;t last 10 seconds.<p>Right after listing it, I edit the price to 8888.<p>SOLD!<p>Did it again:  88888.<p>SOLD!  What?  No worries!<p>I had visions of completely, totally dominating my kids on this neopoints thing.  It would only take one more successful transaction...<p>Listed the ticket for 1020, or something like that.  I worried about the 888 thing and word getting around.<p>The edit?  1020000.  Surely there was no way.<p>And there wasn&#x27;t.  It didn&#x27;t sell.  So I toggled it back and forth.  1020, 1020000, etc...<p>SOLD!<p>Just like that, I was RICH!!<p>Then I got an ominous message:  &quot;If you don&#x27;t give me my points back, I&#x27;m gonna tell.&quot;  Then a few more, most along the lines of it took me X to get all those points, cheater, you suck, etc...<p>I felt completely terrible.<p>Of course, I returned the points and then some.

The language is much cleaner, provides declarative graph pattern matching constructs, and it supports both OLTP graph databases (e.g. Titan, Neo4j, OrientDB) and OLAP graph processors (e.g. Spark, Giraph). With most every graph vendor providing TinkerPop-connectivity, this should make it easier for developers as they don&#x27;t have to learn a new query language for each graph system and developers are less prone to experience vendor lock-in as their code (like JDBC/SQL) can just move to another underlying graph system.",1440288624

There are other algorithms, but I&#x27;m unclear what a good choice is right now. I&#x27;m also unclear if larger key sizes are actually helpful.
(B) For symmetric algorithms, AES, use AES-256. In the quantum case, it might be equivalent to ~127-128 bit AES, which is pretty decent.
(C) For hashing, use SHA-512. It uses 64-bit words, and might be similar in strength to SHA-256 today.
(D) A lot of hash algorithms can actually be used as signature schemes, especially if you combine them with Merkle tree like structures.",1440288395

After all, expensive things that get popular generally become cheaper (or have cheaper versions released).<p>I think performance was a huge problem (I did mention it in passing). But you have to remember that just getting your hands on Smalltalk was difficult back then. There were no free versions, and the commercial versions were expensive. At least with Unix, most university workstations in the 80s had a copy, unlike VMS. The result: a proliferation of free Unix-like OSes while the less accessible VMS slowly fades into obscurity.<p>> I&#x27;m pretty sure that Rubyists are no more ignorant of Smalltalk than Smalltalkers are of Simula.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the analogy. Ruby is an unoriginal Smalltalk knock-off that compromises its purity, simplicity, and dynamicity. Rubyists should therefore express deep admiration for Smalltalk in the same way Smalltalkers do Lisp, but they don&#x27;t. Simula was an ALGOL-60 derivative that had classes and co-routines; by comparison, Smalltalk was nothing short of revolutionary, yet I&#x27;ve never seen a Smalltalker attack it.",1440288109

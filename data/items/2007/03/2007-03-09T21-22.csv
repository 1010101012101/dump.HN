While competition in the seed/angel space is fine and dandy, having a VC firm headed by someone has hacker-aware as Tim O'Reilly seems like a definite win.",1173477158

3278,comment,3172,3256,0,0,notabel,,,"You're right, of course (and I need not point out the irony that DH was in deep with AI), but I'm holding out hope (and not just because I'm bitter that the Connection Machine failed!).  The main reason (in my opinion) that the semantic web has failed so far is the reliance on 1) predefined, very limited ontologies, and 2) creator-generated rich metadata.  Freebase seems to me like, if not the solution, at least a good step in the right direction in terms of addressing these.  The real question, of course, will be whether a userbase springs up to keep it up to date, and whether the logic behind it can keep it reasonably self-consistent.<p>Here's to hoping.",1173475753

If it takes off, it will be not so much a useful product in itself, but an enabling technology for an entirely new class of products. Imagine the possibilities that arise from having a relatively complete, constantly evolving ontology of everything. All of those nifty tricks that computational linguists and proof theoreticians can do over finite domains, using very limited ontologies, become possible for all sorts of other applications. Armed with an ontology that closely matches the real world, it is finally possible to write code that can reason about the real world, rather than just throw Bayes law at it and hope something useful falls out.",1173475546

3273,comment,363,363,0,0,notabel,,,"From an HCI standpoint this would be tricky, but it would be great to have a system for handling dupes and near-dupes by merging their comment pages.  For instance, right now there are two articles about the recent demo of Metaweb/freebase.  I commented on one of them, returned to the mainpage, and realized that the other (which also had no comments) was now higher ranked.<p>This raises a quandry as to whether I should cross-post, or just move on and hope that the discussion happens in the one I picked.<p>(Note, this is the harder case, of near-dupes:  the two articles are different, but \begin{precog} most of the discussion will be about the product they reference.\end{precog}  Hence it is semantically reasonable to merge their comment threads.)<p>So, as a oneliner: add a way to merge duplicate articles.",1173475470

3268,comment,3171,3258,0,0,arasakik,,,"What about providing a way for YC news to identify other users who potentially share the same interests as me? Basically, the set of links which I have upmodded provides YC news with a set of potential topics that I am interested in. Naively comparing this group of links that I have upmodded with that of another user may potentially provide a non-null intersection and show possible common interests; thus, that other user may be someone I am interested in collaborating with. <p>Now that I think about it, another benefit of this is that more relevant news may be surfaced to me - if person X and person Y have a largely overlapping set of upmodded links, then perhaps the set (X-Y) may also be interesting to person Y, and vice versa. Perhaps this could be a way to deal with the perceived quality of news degrading as a site gets more popular as well, as it would allow the system to break off into smaller clusters of news items/people, where each item may be highly relevant to those who belong to the cluster.<p>Sorry to ramble on like that - I don't expect (or necessarily want) such a complicated feature to be a part of the obviously minimal YC news site...just thought I'd bring it up for discussion.<p>Edit: Used in combination with jwrecker's idea of having a more personal space, this could be a great startup idea - instead of YC News determining your set of links, it could simply be the set of links you post to your personal space :D",1173474935

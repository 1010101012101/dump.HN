Then the screen go dark and we remember who we are and go back to our real life. Our mind is like a movie screen and we laugh, cry, feel happy or sad based on the thoughts we ""see"" and immedesimate in. If we could turn the mind off we could remember who we are and go back to our real life",1295693663

2130258,comment,2128009,2128009,0,0,guynamedloren,,,"Like you, I've been searching for a solution that works for a long, long time (and also a college student).  For some reason, to-do lists never felt right to me.  I'm not sure if it has to do with the inherent structure or design of to-do lists (and similar web-based concepts), but they just never clicked.  When searching for the perfect solution I always ended up resorting to scribbling thoughts in tiny notebooks and on whiteboards - something that felt more natural and unstructured than to-do lists.  As I would get things done, I would scratch them off.  The things I wrote down were usually just thoughts (as opposed to ""tasks"") and never had associated numbering systems (for priority) or deadlines.<p>Eventually, I decided to scratch this itch with my first web-based app, Pocket.  I released an MVP a few days ago and it gained quite a bit of traction here on HN, receiving thousands of hits and nothing but positive feedback.  While building Pocket, I translated much of my experiences with physical note-taking to make the app feel as natural as possible, and I'm really pleased with what I have accomplished thus far.  Over the past month or so, I've recorded hundreds of thoughts - everything from new Pocket features to songs I want to download to little miscellaneous reminders, etc.  If you're interested, check it out at <a href=""http://letspocket.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://letspocket.com</a>.  I'd love to hear what you think and whether or not it suits your needs.",1295692064

Think about it.. how many other VC/Angel firms do you know that are generating the kind of buzz that YC has?<p>Wow.. I just realized that's us. We're the fanboys for YC.\n",1177109367
15231,comment,15163,15223,0,0,__,,,"""People start companies because they want to have control and impact and work on interesting things and have more ownership.""<p>That's true.  If these are the founders' main goals, they'll be less averse to raising the acquisition price or working in bigger teams.  They don't even need to be a startup -- they could also be happy as an autonomous research project under the wing of a big company.<p>I was talking about founders hoping to get rich by selling their companies after a few years.  In this case, they want the company to be small, inexpensive, and have few strings attached, to attract as many acquirers as possible.<p>Occasionally, two startups might be a perfect match for each other -- their combined product is far greater than the sum of the parts.  In these cases, it makes sense to merge.  It sounds like this is what you mean.",1177109325

So it seems that there are three options for a company: <p>a) it is already making enough money to pay the devlopers a good salary\nb) it is not making enough money and takes outside investments to pay the developers a good salary = some outsider gets the equity\nc) they pay the developers with the equity they would have given to the outsiders in b)<p>Seems simple enough - in all cases but a equity has to be given away, so why not give it to the developers to begin with.",1177109021

But the button was fake. What really moved the slide was a motor potential building in the brain before they were aware of the desire to move it. It unnerved the patients, because it seemed to them as if the projector was always advancing just before they'd consciously decided to advance it.""",1177108840

I've seen them cheerlead beyond all rational basis for other companies, and I think having much of anything to do with them can give you a very warped perspective.

The company did have board meetings, though, so it sounds like something you'd do re: business more than re: development at an early stage.\n",1177108074

People start companies because they want to have control and impact and work on interesting things and have more ownership. <p>I just wonder if it might be interesting to combine a team that's working on online collaboration, for instance, with another that's working on video sharing and a third that is building a community of some sort. Think 37Signals but from the bottom up. ",1177107844

If you look at these models closely, you realize they resemble various principles employed by mechanical/civil engineering. <p>So what we have here is the attempt by non-technical managers, to bring some ""feel"" of control over something inherently complex (software development), modeled by their semi-successful methods of management employed in traditional industries (read companies like GE).<p>What those guys fail to realize is that software engineering is fundamentally more complex and, therefore, unpredictable than manufacturing industry they're used to (from their business school books).<p>Pathetic.\n",1177107234

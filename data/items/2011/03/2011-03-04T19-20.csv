Why did we make this change? To speak bluntly, the competitive landscape has changed. Our competitors in the Enterprise Linux market have changed their commercial approach from building and competing on their own customized Linux distributions, to one where they directly approach our customers offering to support RHEL.<p>Frankly, our response is to compete. Essential knowledge that our customers have relied on to support their RHEL environments will increasingly only be available under subscription. The itemization of kernel patches that correlate with articles in our knowledge base is no longer available to our competitors, but rather only to our customers who have recognized the value of RHEL and have thus indirectly funded Red Hat’s contributions to open source that will advance their business now and in the future.</i><p>TL;DR: Competition is hard, especially when we are ""open"" and everyone else is not, so we adopted our competitors' tactics.",1299268302

He spends thousands of words discussing that, according to the traditional calorie counting theory (which he is attempting to refute), the difference between a fat person and a thin person is ""only"" 20 calories above their respective maintenance levels. He then argues this must be absurd and incorrect, because how can ""only a cube of sugar in your coffee"" make you fat. This is an attempt at reducto ad absurdum.<p>He never, in his entire blog post, mentions the fact that the fat person is also eating 7 extra strips of bacon each day.

2289457,comment,2288550,2288735,0,0,dspillett,,,"XP is <i>that much</i> less secure than Vista or 7, OK so it has a less capable firewall but my XP installs (and most corporate ones) are sat behind better firewall and other filters than 7 provides. XP is set to get security patches in the same timescales (i.e. not as fast as I'd like in some cases) as Windows 7 until its official EOL in Q2 2014. I will upgrade from XP to 7 some time in 2013, or when there is a compelling reason for me to do so other then XP is due to lose security update support.<p>Sticking with XP does not mean I don't want (or can't have) a modern browser. FF and Chrome both happily support XP, I'll get my modern browsing experience that way if MS is incapable of supporting its own OS. The problem with XP not being supported by IE9 is that corporates (or home users) who have (or think they have) some reason not to use something other than IE (or use something else in conjunction with IE) are stuck with IE8.<p>Upgrading from XP to something newer is not a five minute task. Corporate environments require a lot of testing before a simple update goes out sometimes, so a whole OS change is not a small job. Even for me as a home user it is significant hassle: you can't do an in-place upgrade so I'd have to completely reinstall the OS, re-install and reconfigure all my apps, restore all my data from backups, and so forth. Why would I volunteer for all that work if there wasn't a compelling reason? My work time is quite costly and my personal time, while having no monetary value associated with it, is valuable to me in a number other significant ways. And that is without mentioning I'd have to pay for that upgrade I don't particularly need (and hey, that money is needed, there is vodka and cake to buy!).<p>I know there are reasons for upgrading but they are not compelling reasons for me. Better firewall? I've got one thanks. Better browser? I've got two of those. DX10/DX11? I'm not that much of a gamer that the difference matters and if a game turns up that doesn't support DX9 I'll just not buy it until I have other reason to install a newer Windows (by which time it'll be in a bargain bucket instead of costing £30+£100 for the game plus Windows) if I ever buy it at all. Interface improvements? Nice as they may be, I can certainly live without them.<p>To add my own bad analogy to the collection in this thread: upgrading from XP just to be able to run a better browser then IE8 is like saving 2p per gallon of petrol by taking a 1000 mile round trip to get to the cheapest pump in the country.",1299267526

The primary cost of fast food is not the cost of the raw ingredients, it is the time and effort to make the fast food.  Furthermore many of the customers there see large portions as a value.  Therefore fast food places have found it worth their while to offer large portions at a low price, and to inflate those portions with the cheapest foods that they can - french fries and soft drinks.<p>As long as fast food places do that, there is no real cost difference between 2500 calories and 3500 calories.  Given how addictive most people find food that is high in sugar, fat and salt (which describes soft drink + fries), people tend to finish the portions that they are given.  That will make you obese fairly fast, even if you don't ""supersize"" your portions.<p>Food banks often offer similar foods to fast food places because it is cheap and what their clientele is used to.  This causes similar consequences.  So in the USA even if you have no money at all, it is easy to get fat.<p>If there were cheap, convenient places to eat that made you pay according to calories and were willing to give realistic but smaller portions for significantly lower prices, then your reasoning would be absolutely correct in the USA.<p>Now you can argue that the underlying cause that makes this possible is that the country is rich enough that we can afford to be wasteful even on poor people.  This is absolutely correct.  But for practical purposes that detail doesn't matter.  If you personally have little money and live in the USA, it is really easy to become fat.<p>An incidental note on exercise.  Exercise burns calories.  Obviously.  However it takes very little extra food to offset the calorie expenditure from moderate amounts of additional exercise.  Luckily exercise also affects appetite for many people, and muscle mass increases your basal metabolism.  Therefore exercise is a win, but for moderate amounts of exercise not mainly because it directly burns off calories.",1299265316

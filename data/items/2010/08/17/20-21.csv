First it presents studies that demonstrate how ""people give authority to people that they genuinely like"", then they wonder why ""when you give people power, they basically start acting like fools.""<p>The subtle flaw here is the assumption is that people are given power in the same democratic way as in those studies.<p>When we have any power to hand over directly -- and the inclination to hand it over -- we will tend to hand it over to someone we like, true.

The fact that most of them don't make that\n> effort does not mean they're in the clear.<p>Well, Jacques, once again, that's actually precisely their argument: that they are ""making their best effort"" to preserve the user experience. You say they're not providing what you pay for and tell them why, and then they spin around and tell you that they are providing exactly that, <i>because</i> they are doing what you don't like.<p>And on top of that, they're not promising what you tell them you were sold: there is no bandwidth guarantee. It's like if you showed up to someone's house and bought a stereo, and then after you paid, loudly proclaimed that you actually bought their wife. Saying doesn't make it so, and since this is not a promise they have actually given you, it's a bit unfair to expect that they be held to it.<p>Remember, though before you head down that hole, that I'm not supporting them. I love net neutrality. It think it's great. I'm just saying that your buying bandwidth is <i>not</i> a good basis for argument of the position you elected.<p>>> If you are buying a strict guaranteed bandwidth, do tell me why it is that the ISPs don't actually say that themselves?\n> Because it is to their advantage.\nYou're right.

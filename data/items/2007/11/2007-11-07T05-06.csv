Finally, pagecaching individual pages per user is mostly useless since your cache hit ratio is so low (i.e., it takes very little load off your Rails app).<p>Pagecaching does not kill the point of Rails--Rails is about getting apps done quickly and beautifully. You still use Rails to render pages, and you still use Rails to do all write operations. Caching just means rails doesn't have to constantly recompute data that doesn't change!<p>(disclosure: I'm the author) ",1194415086

Just don't quit.  <p>Also - another reason have a co-founder is a must - someone to make it fun, someone to show your latest coding exploit until the millions of users figure out how cool it is.  Having someone else around makes it alot easier to keep going.  <p>Also - I've found taking an investment from friends and family, even if its a small one, makes it much harder to quit.  You don't want to let them down/embarrass yourself/pay them back :)",1194413253

The likelihood of a start-up succeeding is the product of two unlikely circumstances.<p>So I suppose it is as easy as being exceptional and lucky. <p>Don't sell your house.",1194412566

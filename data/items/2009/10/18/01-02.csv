887765,comment,887765,887428,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"I have a different perspective on this, having built a product company (Zoho Corp) in India for the past 13+ years. Basically India's emerging IT industry coincided with the global credit bubble of the past 2 decades, which simply inflated the IT services industry to monster proportions, in the process sucking the oxygen of talent out of the system. So product start-ups that could have been never got off the ground.<p>This is the mirror image of the process in the US that funneled talent towards the financial complex, which meant the IT industry had to import talent or outsource the work. A good percentage of the talent came from India, and a lot of the outsourced work went to India. In that environment of easy money flowing into services, product companies found it hard to recruit talent (which the author of the post also alludes to).<p>This process basically derailed the emergence of product-based IT industry in India. Some of the Indian services giants of today (Wipro and HCL in particular) were product companies originally. They built some innovative products in India (an x86 based Unix well ahead of Linux, an IP concentrator/router for ISPs in early, to quote two examples) in the late 80s/early 90s. But once the 90's boom got underway, they found it far more lucrative to rent out the talent than to build products.<p>In Economics, it is impossible to argue ""what might have been"", but I believe the configuration of IT industry in India points to how the bubble massively distorted an industry.",1255830108

887758,comment,887668,887746,0,0,silencio,,,"I particularly like the idea, especially after the first payment-processing apps started showing up on the App Store but without any sort of accompanying hardware or ability to capture the credit card number. Just because you need external hardware to read credit cards doesn't mean the hardware isn't feasible for use. Neither does it mean this service needs to require that you swipe a card or only accept credit cards.<p>I for one would love to have a garage sale with such a device, or to go sell my knitted or baked goods at some gathering somewhere where people without such a mobile device might be at a disadvantage payment-wise. I could also, depending on how durable the external hardware is, see using this in a retail setting to accept credit cards in a convenient manner, like at the Apple Store.<p>I know my AmEx card has expresspay (pretty much just rfid on your card) so I can just wave my card near a reader instead of swiping, but I can't see that being standardized for all cards, nor can I see that really working out for consumer devices like the iPhone. I could sort of maybe see cameras, but that ends up taking more time than a simple swipe. So why complicate things?",1255829830

887755,comment,887605,887676,0,0,timwiseman,,,"Yes, but this is normally a bad trade off.  For one thing, if you are in a large organization your DBA (or at least your lead DBA) is often a senior person with a lot of experience and was normally a developer before becoming a DBA.  Part of the DBA's job is to protect the database, and data integrity, from developer mistakes.  In said large organization most of your developers are younger and less experienced and may not always remember to put in the checks in the application.  Code review will certainly help, but even there you often have to validate input in a lot of places where you define database types once.<p>This relationship changes somewhat in smaller organization with a more hand-picked team of course, but even there it is <i>normally</i> less work to set up the schema properly then to make sure every application that ever touches it properly validates every single piece of data for proper type.<p>There are times when a dynamically typed database makes sense, for instance when it is primarily an object store for an object oriented program.  But if you want a relational database with the data integrity and data analysis capabilities it brings to bear, then it probably makes more sense to use a statically typed database.",1255829693

887753,comment,887605,887605,0,0,seldo,,,"(I also commented on the article, but nobody seems to be commenting over there, so reposting...)<p>The advantage of statically typed RDBMS that he's leaving out here are (a) storage optimization (b) query optimization (as jawngee has already noted).<p>You could get halfway to simulating a dynamically-typed RDBMS by declaring all your columns as, say, VARCHAR(5000). You could store strings, integers, floats, dates, etc. all in there pretty simply. However, they would use a lot more storage space as strings than they would as native data types (e.g. integer 1000 is one byte, string '1000' is 4). Over a large data set that would really add up.<p>Secondly, when doing queries, your comparison operators (e.g. WHERE date > 2009-07-06) would be way less efficient as string comparisons than native type comparisons.<p>I don't want to be dismissive and curmudgeonly about this, but over and over what I hear from people enthusiastic about NoSQL solutions is that they solve the current problems of RDBMS, while forgetting all the great features that we have spent the last 30 years building <i>into</i> database systems.<p>The current ""limitations"" of SQL-based systems are often in fact age-old trade-offs that we made, but people have forgotten the positive benefits of those trade-offs. The reason databases are statically typed is because that saves storage space and processing time. The reason there's a standardized, domain-specific language that you have to learn is because having to learn a completely new API and mental model every time you want to access a data store from a new vendor is inefficient. Oh, and the reason SQL is so complicated is because <i>relational algebra is complicated</i>.<p>Sure, SQL and RDBMS have their limitations. They're not the right tool for every job, and they are not even 100% perfect at the jobs where they are the right tool. But too often I hear people saying ""fuck SQL!"" simply because they don't want to learn it, and because they're too early on in their little pet project to realize the scalability problems a NoSQL system is going to run into that RDBMS solved 20+ years ago.",1255829496

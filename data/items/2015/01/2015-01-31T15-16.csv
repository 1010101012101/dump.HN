It didn&#x27;t take long to see that their consistent efforts yielded progress in excess of what the rest of us &quot;self-motivators&quot; were making. I don&#x27;t know why that came as a surprise. After all, my Dad, who was a staff sergeant, raised three boys by himself-our mother died when we were 3, 2, 6 mos-while running an architecture firm.<p>Some may say we need a holistic approach in how we get ourselves to do what can be unpleasant but also life and career enhancing tasks; I think that makes things more complicated than they need to be.

For example, is there one thing you always do first at work? Make coffee, open email? Then choose a tiny habit you would like to form (it should take less than 30 seconds) and do it right after that normal routine habit. (I don&#x27;t know, maybe write down one task you promised someone you would do and pin it on your monitor). Then after you have done the tiny habit, give yourself a small celebratory high-five. (Cheesy as it sounds, the tiny habit where I didn&#x27;t do this little celebration didn&#x27;t stick after the week long program).<p>Check out and sign up for his 1 week program (its free).",1422719838

And for my luck, of the 2 large companies where I worked there was no chance of flex-time, or remote - or any kind of non- 9-5 schedule even for devs.  On the other hand  at 1 of them everyone left at 5 on the dot cause no one cared about their jobs - and a strict 40 a week feels like vacation a lot.<p>I think regardless of where you go you have to pick wisely (and I only picked large because my options where limited and the salaries where good.).<p>But as a rule small - not just startup, means you have more power and control over yourself and your fiefdom.  And that freedom is what you like that&#x27;s where you should go.  (Or research - there&#x27;s a lot more paperwork with research teams, but there&#x27;s a lot of freedom as well.)<p>And yes - if you like writing good code you are proud of years later a big co is good place to do it.

8976990,comment,8973023,8976884,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I tend to agree with you in that I do not weigh a decision based on the amount of equity they are offering. A little side story as to why I do not weigh equity as I used to. Back in the first bubble (1998-2000) I went to work for a startup that had good leadership, big investors, and really came to define the SaaS model (although we called it an Application Service Provider at the time). I took a slight pay cut to come to work there, but I saw upside and they offered me a great equity package. A year and half down the road we were growing and planning to go public. They had not planned well and given out too much equity. Prior to the IPO we had to do an 8 to 1 reverse split, meaning that for every 8 shares you had you now had 1. Although the IPO was fairly successful out of the gate, moral was destroyed by the reverse split.<p>However, with that in mind, I will still give up salary in return for equity if I am (a) passionate about the business idea, (b) believe that there is a good chance that the business will succeed, (c) believe in the founders and team that is already in place, including any investors. And looking back (I am in my 40s now) the younger you are the more risk you can absorb in terms of equity. I enjoy the startup world and am willing to take risks. Plus, like any other job if it doesn&#x27;t look like it is panning out or you are unhappy there is nothing holding you there.",1422719571

When I changed my focus from goal or product orientation to simply discipline/process orientation, I started achieving more.<p>Somehow there is an emotional weight to thinking about results. To push this burden off, I felt I needed motivation. Ironically I started seeing much better results, when I aligned myself to disciplined execution with a certain detachment to results.

8976986,comment,8973204,8976445,0,0,pwang,,,"> If your hadoop cluster is slow...<p>You&#x27;re right, there is a lot of misinformation and hope about Hadoop out there, and I think there is a lot of value in Hadoop as a cheap data integration archive.  But I think the parent poster&#x27;s point still stands.  A Hadoop-based infrastructure currently has a lot of impedance mismatch for full end-to-end advanced analytics with a bunch of stats, linear algebra, or graph stuff from native code which are not Java-based.<p>I would love to see a TCO analysis on Hadoop+analytics versus buying a more traditional &quot;supercomputer&quot; stack with infiniband or one of the nifty Cray/SGI NUMA systems.  Current data warehouse and BI folks are fixated on cost per PB of storage, and Hadoop is very cheap based on that single metric.  I suspect that if enough human factors and accuracy/agility of modeling results are considered, the latter may be quite cost effective.  It&#x27;s just that the &quot;big iron&quot; vendors are still in the middle of retooling their marketing for the BI/DW/ETL crowd.  When they finally figure it out, it&#x27;s going to be a bloodbath.<p>For instance, SGI UVs can give me 24TB-64TB of RAM in a single &quot;system&quot;. I still have to make sure I do multithreading/multiprocessing well, but the interconnects are lower latency than 40GBe.  <a href=""https://www.sgi.com/products/servers/uv/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sgi.com/products/servers/uv/</a><p>HP ProLiants now can fit 48-60 cores and 6TB in a single 4U system: <a href=""http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/servers/proliant-servers.html?compURI=1479235#.VMz3SWTF-Yo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/servers/proliant-servers.h...</a><p>Buying a few of these scale-up systems is a LOT cheaper than hundreds of nodes of Hadoop sitting around maxing out I/O while their expensive Xeons have 10% CPU load.

I find it very helpful to write down all these things as a list, because trying to remember them is subconsciously a source of stress. Not to do anything about them then, but just writing them down to get them out of your head.<p>This is one of the real gems of understanding that I got from reading David Allen&#x27;s &quot;Getting Things Done&quot;. Having these things written down on a list frees your mind from having to try and remember them and also makes it much easier to go through the list and sort it in terms of importance or even get rid of some items altogether!

She&#x27;s apparently not happy with it right now, haha.<p>I don&#x27;t see what you mean about Magma. This is what I&#x27;ve found for Magma: <a href=""http://www.math.harvard.edu/computing/magma/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.harvard.edu/computing/magma/</a>. It looks like Pascal with Python list comprehensions and sets as a first-class type.<p>Source code in most languages is a one-dimensional construct. Every source file in the project could be concatenated, the newline characters removed, and it would still compile to the same program (assuming the right ordering, barring white-space significant languages, etc.).<p>Is that because we are linear? Is that because our computers are linear? I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re ever going to get away from written language as the abstraction of source code. Most (all?) people think in words. But how that language is presented might change. Literal lines and connectors between code elements has <i>sucked</i> in 2D because it just gets too dense for 2D space. Is that because linear things &quot;want&quot; to stay linear? Or is it because we have had to deal with 2D interfaces and it&#x27;s easier to work in N-1 dimensions when using an N-dimensional interface?<p>And while I think I&#x27;ve seen attempts at this in 3D, then we have the other issue of 3D interfaces being terrible on 2D IO devices. Never have the two been put together.<p>But I think that&#x27;s going to change very soon. A lot more people are experimenting with this sort of stuff these days. Good-enough stereo displays are accessible to everyone (slap your phone in the cardboard box you ordered a set  of $5 lenses in). Language design is more accessible to everyone. Editor development is, too (I couldn&#x27;t imagine doing this project 5 years ago, and even 3 years ago it would have been a very poor experience). There is just a culmination of different technologies that make it possible for just about anyone to hack on all of this stuff.<p>Somehow, there seems to be a lot of discouragement lately to do so, but that&#x27;s a different story entirely. I&#x27;ll just leave it at saying, I hate the phrase, &quot;don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel&quot;.",1422719363

In that scenario there is no alternative to SSHFP + DNSSEC, and it&#x27;s  available to use today.<p>Given that the original concept proposed for HTTP auth over SSH is accepted as ridiculous, the number of use-cases for opening a SSH session from a browser is still minimal, and even then, those clients can also get the benefits of SSHFP + DNSSEC the same as regular sessions.<p>> That sshd that runs on that port is customized and might create, like you mentioned earlier, a dynamically-created remote environment for the user.<p>That wasn&#x27;t at all what I meant - I meant that you might offer a web UI to create a new remote environment for a person to use, and then provide a shortcut &quot;login with SSH&quot; button - just a regular sshd process on a regular *nix box. A more common option might be a button in a VPS provider&#x27;s control panel, to quickly launch an SSH session to an instance (particularly if the hostnames are reasonably long and hard to type)<p>> Basically, since the browser can understand the rest of the HTML/HTTP on the trusted page along with the ssh://name?fingerprint link, I think it makes sense to leverage it when wanting to open a connection to the same name, rather requiring the name to be a domain name and using DNS to get those values.<p>That implies a heavy tie between the browser and SSH. Technically, if you wanted to do this, one could write a small script/app that gets registered as the default ssh:// handler, parses out the FP and adds it to the known_hosts file before calling the regular ssh. But for obvious reasons this is dangerous without knowing the source of the FP. Which brings us back to a browser having to understand and integrate with SSH.<p>Im sorry but I just don&#x27;t see the problem you have with using SSHFP records for this, or the specific desire to integrate with a browser and HTML of all things.<p>At best, you&#x27;d still have to have your fingerprints in both places (DNS and markup) to support a) connections initiated manually and b) browser/ssh combinations that don&#x27;t support manually specifying a fingerprint but do support SSHFP records (which currently, is all browsers and any reasonably recent version of OpenSSH)<p>Frankly a better endeavour than getting a browser to understand SSH, would be to a) get more people using VerifyHostKeyDNS and SSHFP records and b) get more people using DNSSEC. Those are actual, real world things that are simply lacking adoption/usage, but do very much work.",1422717583

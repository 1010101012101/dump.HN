297574,comment,297297,297347,0,0,goodness,,,"In the case of the linux desktop, I have to say that I think it is a lot closer than 8 years ago.  I have tried installing Linux at many points over the last 8 years or so.  I have always abandoned it because configuring hardware took too much work.  I recently installed Ubuntu 8.04 on 3 different machines, including a brand new Dell laptop, and the install worked flawlessly on each.  Most importantly, every piece of hardware I've tried worked with basically no configuration - sound card, internal microphone, wireless, and graphics card.  I did install a new driver for the Nvidia graphics card, but this was mostly optional.  Also, when I've needed to tweak settings or install the new driver for the video card, I've done it through a GUI rather than the command line and various cryptic config files.<p>Installing software through Synaptic is also awesome.  This is one place where Linux now actually excels over Windows.  Of course, I haven't actually needed to install anything that's not in synaptic yet.",1220806251

I started climbing mountains not long ago, and, having lifted weights for many years, was able to go further and faster than most experienced climbers.  (Though of course in mountaineering your brain is more important than your legs.)  Same with skiing, trail running, backpacking... strength helps with everything.<p>Your biceps and triceps must work against each other or you will have no control over what you're doing.<p>Sounds like you've fallen under the influence of quacks.",1220805555

Far from running scared from this kind of thing I'm constantly trying to get the rest of the business to except off the self software for all the little tools that they ask for so that we can focus on the key business differentiators.<p>Problem is, they're a big company and they want slick corporate branded stuff that integrates with our ActiveDirectory and where the drop downs have sucked values in from other apps so it all just works. Which is fine, only, it costs loads and its in most cases it's not worth it.<p>I think it'll be hard for a lot of big corporates to accept that it's better (for example) to adjust their business to  Zoho CRM than to hire people to adjust SAP CRM to their business. I think a few startups will have to adopt things like Zoho and then grow big, before the incumbents change.",1220805354

In radio, payola was wrong becaue the radio stations claimed to be playing the most popular music as measured by sales or fan requests or whatever, when in reality they were playing what they were paid to play.<p>DEMO may be charging $18,500, but they disclose that up front. It may not be to their competitor's taste, but it isn't Payola.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola</a><p>""Payola, in the American music industry, is the illegal practice of payment or other inducement by record companies for the broadcast of recordings on music radio, in which the song is presented as being part of the normal day's broadcast. Under US law, 47 U.S.C. ยง 317, a radio station can play a specific song in exchange for money, but this must be disclosed on the air as being sponsored airtime, and that play of the song should not be counted as a ""regular airplay."" The term has come to refer to any secret payment made to cast a product in a positive light (such as obtaining positive reviews).""",1220803284

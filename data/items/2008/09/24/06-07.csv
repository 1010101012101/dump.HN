313252,comment,312378,312378,0,0,jawngee,,,"Weird, I use my iPhone for everything but a phone, because, frankly, it sucks as a phone.  Which is good, because I let it disrupt me less and am less likely to disrupt other people because I don't want to wait for it to unfreeze and then another 30 seconds it takes me to scroll through my contacts list and then thumb the fucking thing and then click on call.<p>And, shit, I don't even use it for email because it sucks for that too.  I can't search.  I have 5 email accounts for various things and I have to click 15 times to check them all, instead of a single view like the blackberry.  Oh and I can't search.  I mentioned that.  Did I mention that?  Yeah, I can't search.  And when I click on a message I have to wait for the fucking webkit view to load before I can read it.  I can't copy and paste addresses, I can't forward emails as sms's, I can't save attachments.  SO awesome.<p>So yeah I use it for everything but email and the phone.  And maybe SMS messaging too I do a lot less of because it's another slow cumbersome process that zaps the joy out of semi-realtime conversation.  I love it when it craps out, and how it can't send in the background and those wonderfully stupid chat bubbles.  I am not 12 years old.<p>So I don't really use it for anything other than browsing the web, tracking poker stats and playing Wurdle.  I love Wurdle.  I can play it until my thumbs cramp.  I hope those guys make millions.",1222239404
313250,comment,312872,312872,0,0,kamme,,,"I have it installed and it works great but I must admit I didn't make the switch, partially because of the lack of extensions (I'm a web developer so I use firebug, webdev toolbar, etc a lot).<p>But it also made me think about what I like about chrome. Then I went looking for extensions to install on Firefox and I must admit I don't miss chrome because I have most of the good stuff in Firefox now!",1222239331
313248,comment,312025,313000,0,0,litewulf,,,"What I was saying is that for regular Google search I'm pretty sure they use regular web search algorithms.<p>Also, I really think the fixation on Pagerank is quite a devious thing Google has done, because it completely obscures all the other complexity of a search engine. Be it stemming, synonyms, inferring search intent, etc, most of that stuff doesn't really come out of Pagerank. There are ""thousands of signals"" or whatever it is that the Keepers of the Search have, and they all play varying roles in the actual ranking process. Could knol articles be more effectively winnowed than by web search? Yes. Would it be appropriate do treat knol articles specially in web search? Probably not (imagine user backlash).<p>Within Knol, they also have the advantage of ratings and other stuff though. What really bothered me about your initial comment was the ""maybe they use some social news site style voting""... you could have actually looked and said ""oh! they have ratings"", instead of just blindly pontificating.",1222238735
313247,comment,312548,312548,0,0,s3graham,,,"Basic functionality works really well.<p>I find it a bit unsatisfying that when I search for an artist, that's not what I hear because the station's likely moved to the next thing. I understand what's happening, but I don't get what I want.<p>Do you do any clustering yet? The list of results is sort of a ""big pile"", and after I pick one, I'd like expect to see related/also-would-like stations. Especially if it's not immediately ""good"".<p>Also, need to fix the Back button.",1222238726
313246,comment,312807,313214,0,0,aneesh,,,"Definitely, Paulson knows more about this than Congress.  But Paulson has the perspective that comes with being a former Goldman Sachs CEO, so he might (knowingly or unknowingly) be biased towards helping out the banks too much.",1222238623
313245,comment,312827,313182,0,0,litewulf,,,"Er rather, I meant a different selection bias. The one where you selectively remember friends that fit your hypothesis.<p>Also, the thing with quite a few statistics is that the risk is say 1/1000, and I honestly have closer to 50 people who I interact with in a month.",1222238531
313244,comment,312927,313165,0,0,timr,,,"Don't sweat it.  Not that long ago, you didn't have a <i>prayer</i> of starting a successful business before the age of 30.  The 20-year-old founder is a very recent fad.<p>The demographics may be shifting, but it isn't your fault.",1222238486

313241,comment,313140,313212,0,0,gscott,,,"Sure but if you are transfering terabytes of data around I am not sure if that is the right system to use.  Better to have a dedicated line and a SAN.<p>But then again I live 10 years behind the times.  One day I will stop using font tags, center tags, tables, Windows 2000, and ASP 3.0.  But then again no need to change what works.",1222238255
313240,comment,313025,313070,0,0,davidw,,,"> But there's certainly years of material left after that, if you want it. After eight years off and on I still haven't touched a sizeable number of emacs features.<p>Precisely.  You can get productive with emacs after a relatively short period of time, but you will have a lifetime of learning afterwards.  After 10 years, I'm still discovering new things.",1222238193
313239,comment,313025,313133,0,0,johnm,,,"That makes sense if you're using Emacs on a laptop.<p>However, when you're at your desk, the most awesome Emacs upgrade is to buy a Kinesis Ergo ""Contoured"" keyboard (<a href=""http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/</a>).  It moves all of the control/alt/Apple/Meta keys from all of the random locations to your thumbs and so once you get used to it, it's way, way better than anything else.<p>The only downside is that it only comes in one size so if you have large hands / long fingers it might be too cramped.<p>For the skeptics, once you get used to it, it's actually quite easy to go back and forth between the laptop keyboard and the Kinesis.  I.e., very little mental dissonance.",1222238169

313233,comment,312827,313185,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"taking into account emotions (which are an antiquated reaction system based on choosing a course of action with incomplete information in a hunter-gatherer tribe setting) is an important part of reason.  And the term rational has an extremely solid foundation: a set of self-consistent rules that allow you to accurately predict reality.  If it doesn't predict reality, throw it out and go back to deductive experiments until you come up with something better. Rationalism is inductive.  that's the whole point.",1222237245
313232,comment,312849,312849,0,0,slater,,,"What I don't understand is, why haven't all these clever people, kicked out of the app store on spurious grounds (Apple: ""it kinda sorta almost looks like something we've already done or are about to unveil""), banded together to make a simple installer for their apps, something like a jailbreaking wrapper for their app: \nYou make your ""illegal"" iPhone app, stuff it thru the wrapper which then creates a .dmg installer file. Users then double-click the .dmg, the wrapper searches for your iPhone, if its not jailbroken it asks you whether you want to jailbreak it (with an option to download the latest jailbreak version), then installs the app.",1222236986

313228,comment,312807,313125,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Depends on whether you believe this'll be inflationary or deflationary.<p>If the government decides to inflate to pay off the bailout, then it sucks for savers and is awesome for mortgagees.  But if their intervention isn't enough to halt the deflationary pressure of all these financial institutions failing, then it'll be catastrophic for debtors and good for savers.<p>People who held cash in the depression (and didn't see it wiped out by a bank run) gained close to 4x their money in about 2 years, which is as good or better than most other bubbles in history.  That's relative to consumer prices: relative to asset prices (like stocks), it was nearly a 10x return.",1222236723

313225,comment,312849,313142,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"No, I appreciate it, I wasn't aware of that.  I think that it makes my point even clearer, however.  The only reason that Apple doesn't want to allow a VM of OSX to be able to run on top of Linux, BSD, Solaris or Windows is because they want a locked down system.  They want to make more money selling the associated hardware.  And, while that is certainly a choice they are entitled to make, it speaks fairly loudly to a culture of being closed and locked down.<p>Even Microsoft is releasing Open Source licensed software these days.  Isn't OSX built on top of a Darwin Kernel?  Any one know of Open Source releases the Apple has done?  It would be nice if they returned the favor to the community.<p></rant>",1222236433

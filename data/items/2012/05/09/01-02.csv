3946745,comment,3945353,3946476,2,0,soundslikeneon,,,"> The article shows that the site works in IE9 and IE10.<p>To return to the analogy, a closed store will have stocked shelves and a cash register on sundays. The problem is that the store owner doesn't want to pay someone to work sundays making sure things are ok and stay that way. Likewise, supporting IE is not just a process of running through a site once and saying, ""looks good."" It requires continual testing, and this testing happens every time the site changes.<p>Also, Chick-fil-a is closed on Sundays and they claim it is a feature. And some people are religious about browsers too.",1336528634

3946739,comment,3945353,3946118,5,0,gebe,,,"I am an Opera user as well but I really tried to do the Chrome switch when I got a new laptop and decided on a fresh install of everything. I was thinking that it might be time to begin a new chapter in my personal browser-history-life and hop on the Chrome bandwagon. It didn't take more than a day or two until I got drawn back to Opera though.<p>I know it's just mostly/only about ""old habits die hard"" but I just feel that so much is amiss in Chrome. From small things like that I have to get an app to get a dropdown address bar list (I mean really?) or the lack of intuitive hotkeys (my favourite is Opera's ctrl + z for undoing a closed tab) to bigger things like that I have to put up with Google's constant nagging about logging in to this or that or the lack of features that Opera has out the box (like Opera Turbo and such).<p>An old usage case before I got a no-limit data package plan was trying to save bandwidth while tethering from my phone. In Opera I could first put on Opera Turbo (like a proxy compressing service) and with another two clicks control what elements I want shown. I could easily and intuitively turn off pictures for example and only choose show those that I may want to look at. It was great for surfing light!<p>I am no rockstar web developer nor am I interested in figuring out what plugins/apps I need. I just want stuff to work, out of the box, while still having access to some cool stuff. And for that Opera works wonders for me (even though the support for it ain't that great ;) )!",1336528422

Lots of Mark's friends, including myself, suggested using one of the screen corners as a hot-zone. But since most people usually have other actions associated with the corners and the extra distance required to drag the icon far from the center makes the movement tedious, Mark kept looking for a better way to handle it.<p>He spent weeks & months trying out different UI and actions, finally coming up with the 'shake-your-cursor' action. It seems trivial now that you see it but it was something none of his potential users could imagine. And since then, he's been refining the app constantly to get it to its current state, including the rotating background and optimal thumbnail for a variety of mimetypes.

As what is essentially an introductory course for this subject, it should not be aiming to really challenge the top quartile of the class (or whatever). It should aim to provide the best possible foundation for the next course for as many people as reasonable.<p>The fact that the course has managed to reach out to all sorts of people (including someone like you) is something that should be celebrated. That it was designed so that someone who isn't 'good at math' (whatever that means) struggled a bit, but still got through it all is amazing.

It's not just ""Bill gates offered me more money, so I want out.""<p>A ""claim"" is something like--the producers let loose a pack of wolves in the studio and now I am disfigured, or they broadcast on TV that I am a cannibal and eat live children on Thursday nights, and my reputation is ruined.  A ""claim"" is something that you can (normatively) sue ABC about.  Bill Gates offering you $8 billion dollars is not a tort committed by ABC.  ""If I had known X, I wouldn't have done the deal"" is not a <i>claim</i>.  (Deliberately lying might be a claim, but that's a topic for another day...)<p>It's a convention in contract law (see meeting of the minds, unconscionability) that you have to have some idea of what you are signing for a contract to be valid, and there's a lot of arguing about what that means state-by-state, etc.  California has specifically (attempted to) codify in Section 1542 that if a claim is ""unknown"" to you it doesn't meet that test.  So if you are signing a waiver of liability of injury thinking about things like falling off a ladder, but not considering that the producers deliberately attack you with a pack of wolves, the latter might be an ""unknown"" claim that you didn't consider when signing the release.  Under Section 1542, you could argue that even though you have signed a waiver, the waiver only covered things you would have reasonably considered, which do not include being deliberately attacked by wolves.<p>What this section does (IANAL) is say ""Even though contract law doesn't let you waive a right you don't understand, and even though California has specifically exempted you from being responsible in this instance, fuck that, you're responsible.""  Which, I don't know if it is an enforceable clause or not, but it's <i></i>certainly not moral<i></i>, and it has nothing to do with ""got a better deal, now I want out.""",1336525502

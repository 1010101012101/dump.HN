263925,comment,263648,263648,0,0,ars,,,"OK, I tried. I really tried to give them the benefit of the doubt - I mean it's mit.edu, but seriously what they wrote there and what I know of physics have little to do with one another.<p>I fell like I'm missing a joke somewhere.<p>First off: what does electrolysis have to do with photosynthesis? If you want to store energy it's just as important with wind, or any other.<p>Second: photosynthesis and photovoltaics are not the same thing. They seem to confuse them quite a bit. And on top of that, this seems to have nothing to do with either of them - it's all about electrolysis.<p>Third: ""Currently available electrolyzers, which split water with electricity and are often used industrially, are not suited for artificial photosynthesis because they are very expensive and require a highly basic (non-benign) environment that has little to do with the conditions under which photosynthesis operates.""<p>Has so many errors I don't even know where to start.<p>a: electrolysis does not require a basic environment, it requires a salty one.<p>b: again mixing up photosynthesis and photovoltaics<p>c: there is no such a thing as artificial photosynthesis. Only plants know how to make hydrocarbons from water CO2 and light.<p>If someone actually did manage to create artificial photosynthesis that would be massive. Which is what I hoped to read about here, and then I didn't.<p>Fourth: they start off saying something about advances in solar power, and well? Where was the advance? All I see is something about electrolysis.<p>Fifth: ""[plants] storing energy for use when the sun doesn't shine."" Most plants don't actually do that. They don't store energy, they make hydrocarbons, which are not an energy source for them, they are the final product. (For us the hydrocarbon is energy storage.) There is the CAM photosynthesis cycle used by pineapples, which does actually store energy for later. But the only reason the pineapple does that is so that it doesn't dry out during the hot day, so rather it collects it's CO2 at night. This does not seem to apply here.<p>Someone: please tell me if I missed something massive, but this really looks like the kind of nonsense energy inventions you read about all the time. But, but, but it's on mit.edu!",1217590740

Reframe as ""Make new friends"" and you'll do well.<p>When meeting someone new: \n - Give yourselves an ""official"" reason to talk again, e.g. something to follow up on. It can be small like a exchanging a link or two.\n - Give them an ""unofficial"" reason to talk again, e.g. they should want to talk to you again. Be funny/interesting/poised for success.",1217590473

I had always thought electrolysis was a non starter for large scale production because of the inefficiencies involved.<p>Even th article seems to focus on how they invented non-toxic catalysts.  It mentions nothing about improving the efficiency of the reaction.",1217589376

But, these trollers are lying when they say ""look, because we did this, it shows that you should be more alert to people who can also do it but actually intend harm."" Or, ""we've hurt your feelings, maybe you need to toughen up cupcakes, next time it could concern something that actually mattered."" To me, the serious trollers do intend harm for the most part and they say it in this interview. Their excuses are a lie. They are the practical jokers that go overboard, placing white hats over their black hats when things go bad.<p>I saw a documentary once of a team of people boarding a plane during its refueling and restocking at an airport. They ran down the aisles jumping around. Their message of ""look what we can do and no one can stop us"" should be taken seriously, and they had then intent to help.<p>If someone wants to do some white-hat cracking for real benefit, why not announce it before the act has taken place and do it in a way where the recipient can at least first respond and say, ""no, we'll do it ourselves"" or thanks go ahead. If they ignore such a warning, the cracker can go ahead and at least have some form of recourse. I can't see many crackers doing that anyway, and the whole area's shady. White-hat crackers are usually treated like criminals.",1217588789

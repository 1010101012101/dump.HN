It&#x27;s pretty well known that if you put good stuff on the internet, people will find it, including through google.<p>>And when you have 1200 visitors (say a year from now) per day and you lose half your visitors per day (because they are search engine traffic) and you&#x27;re back to 600 you could still argue that you lost your motivation.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s always true that it hurts to lose a source of traffic. I don&#x27;t follow your point.<p>>How many visitors come to your site is just a number. What you get out of th engagement is the key imo, and in that sense 50 people that you engage with are worth 500 that just visit and look at what you write.<p>This is true, but you seem to be assuming that google visitors are less engaged.

I do feel I have a strong grasp on the metaphors contained within religious practices.<p>In my opinion religion exists for both good and evil. It helps certain humans who are unable to cope with the reality of permanent death and loss. It helps people who have become unfocused or destitute to dedicate their lives to something they feel is larger than their own issues.<p>The evil it serves is obvious. People are robbed of time, money, creativity and hope. Wars are started over it and scientific progress is halted due to it.<p>Not all religions / religious practices / beliefs are good or evil of course. That would be too broad a statement, but even some seemingly harmless religions such as buddhism lead to violence and oppression.<p>I personally stand to gain nothing from committing to a religion or conforming to a belief system, but there are others who need to be told what to do by men who claim a higher authority.

This being science, when has the truth ever been precisely one end of the spectrum or the other? I&#x27;m naturally skeptical of pundits, advocating science, who point out that developers with their own office perform better than developer who share an open space with the call center and then claim that this demonstrates that private offices are the best solution.<p>The key quote from the article is &quot;quieter and more private&quot;.<p>Maybe in the days when The Architect wrote a design doc and The Engineers went into their offices for six months, then a private office was a great way to get to the &quot;Oh fuck this thing will never work&quot; moment faster.<p>In contrast most teams I work with collaborate at the feature level: engineers work on the same feature, implementing different pieces together, before moving on to the next feature. We have other teams where individual developers take a feature and go off and work on it for a few days. The &quot;individuals&quot; are &quot;faster&quot; claiming work is complete, but the &quot;teams&quot; are faster at producing work that is accepted.<p>I should also add that while the team environment works for most engineers, we have some that absolutely require a private space, and we try to accommodate them. Individuals work differently and when we find someone good we try to make the environment work for them.<p>YMMV.",1403107430

So that limits the number of domains per cert to ~20 (since we include 2 SANs per domain, root.com & *.root.com).<p>Answer to the free question: SNI + IPv6. Hopefully one more reason for people to adopt IPv6. And limited IPv4 space is a much bigger factor for us than the CA cost.",1403107419

7910842,comment,7909806,7909806,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"OP is a generally good post. Two minor comments.<p><i>Open plan has the advantages of being familiar, allowing more people to fit into the same space, and being more egalitarian. I.e., since offices are viewed as status symbols, providing them to developers and not to other groups could have a significant negative impact on morale among non-developers.</i><p>Open-plan <i>seems</i> egalitarian, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s the opposite. If you&#x27;re a manager and your boss is on another floor, you don&#x27;t have to worry about what&#x27;s on your screen, how often you go to the bathroom, and people coming up behind you (only interns will do that) when you&#x27;re obviously not receptive. It&#x27;s subordinates who end up feeling like caged animals.<p>When you work in an open-plan office, power relationships are shoved in your face 8 hours per day. If you&#x27;re the rare sadistic middle manager who enjoys watching people squirm, you can do &quot;the Boss Walk&quot; all day and enjoy it. Everyone else (even decent managers) is miserable. If I were a manager, I wouldn&#x27;t want this: I <i>don&#x27;t want</i> people to feel threatened and anxious (or a need to change what&#x27;s on their screen) every time I walk by their desk on the way to take a piss.<p><i>That the engineers at your company are more productive, or more in tune with the needs of the business because of the constant natural interaction with their coworkers.</i><p>I worked for an R&D think-tank during a summer internship. Everyone had an office, but at 3:00 there was &quot;tea&quot; and people got together for snacks and board games for an hour. They naturally ended up having this kind of conversation.<p>There are better ways to achieve this. Open-plan offices may populate the social graph, but they flood it with antagonistic edges. What the fuck good is that? None.",1403107310

Just guessing - in any case there might be effects that offset the lower productivity.<p>Otoh I was floored to read today that Amazon apparently has lots of dogs in their offices because it is supposedly good for the atmosphere, lower stress levels and whatnot. I heard Google has lots of office dogs, too. I hope this is not a case of pseudoscientific superstition, because for me office dogs would be an absolute deal breaker.

So, where your site states,\n&quot;Lots of outdoor space and fresh air&quot;\n&quot;Encouragement of normal animal behaviour&quot;\nI wonder if that is translated the same as the United States:\n&quot;Provide access to the outdoors so that animals can exercise their natural behaviors&quot;\n&quot;Support animal health and welfare&quot;<p>If it is, I really wonder if they&#x27;re being applied the same, or if yours are as open for interpretation as ours. My experience with US organic farming is dairy and chicken. I work with farmers quite a bit through the extension office of my college employer. The organic farmers in my area practice (in my opinion) very loose organic practices.<p>For example, access to outdoors was available, but in an enclosed area (run for chickens, small pasture for cattle). This, by no means allowed the animals to &quot;exercise their natural behaviors,&quot; and yet was within the legal definition of organic, and allowed them to sell their products to grocery stores and markets as &#x27;certified organic&#x27;.<p>The health and welfare laws mentioned in the second portion apply to all farmers, regardless of  organic certification or not.<p>Is the interpretation similar in Europe?",1403107248

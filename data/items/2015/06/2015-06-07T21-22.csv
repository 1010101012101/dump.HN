I just don&#x27;t see myself getting good enough at those to be anywhere competitive with other people and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it.<p>So if those were the main areas where there&#x27;s decent money to be made, best I could hope for is get a mediocre position to earn some money to hopefully pay back my student loans while definitely being unhappy doing something I don&#x27;t enjoy. The alternative would be to go into some field that pays shit, let&#x27;s say CS in this scenario, where I might be excellent at but even earn less than being a mediocre painter, and hope to still make it there and at least be happy.

9676454,comment,9675783,9676406,0,0,VLM,,,"Both the romans and greeks have a lot of documentation from multiple sources from the &quot;empire era onward&quot; about them being a major trading center, but there is a lack of documentation before the empire era.  Note that doesn&#x27;t prove no trade was happening, just no one wrote it down.  Their economic linkage with rome pretty much began with the empire and grew more or less continuously till the empire fell apart.<p>From memory there was nothing documented about the Aksumite kingdom in greco-roman writing until 0100 AD and it was a greek who&#x27;s name I forget who had some flowery prose about it being a major ivory trading hub at that time.  Also the Aksumites didn&#x27;t have their stuff together as a kingdom until 0100 or so.  Although I also remember some roman writing about it being an iron hub much later.  It was a major trading partner of rome... if the land route wasn&#x27;t nuts they&#x27;d probably have ended up a province.  They grew close, really close.<p>I suspect what happened is the journalist filter input something like &quot;artefacts dating from 150 BCE&quot; and output &quot;artefacts dating from the first and second centuries.&quot;  To take out the technical stuff, make it more mass market, simpler, more least common denominator.  However most people assume a date like 2015 or &quot;2nd century&quot; means AD/CE and this is extremely important in context..  Trade with the romans in 200AD when the kingdom was flourishing would be the most boring story ever, but proven trade going back to 200BC before there was an organized Aksumite nation is a pretty cool story.<p>Being a really likely sounding narrative doesn&#x27;t prove its true; could be some kind of proto-Aksumite site in 90 AD before they got their stuff together as a kingdom.  That might make an interesting story of its own.  I always figured the Aksumites got their stuff together and then started trading with the Romans some time later, once their economy stabilized and they had the basics down and some surplus to trade.  The actual story might be the romans helped them get their stuff together by injecting trade goods so the cause and effect are flipped.  That is a pretty cool story, but again, sounding likely or cool has little to do with truth.  Still, if true, it would be a heck of a story.<p>Someday when it all settles down and gets documented, it probably will be a cool story.  We&#x27;re just not going to get the cool story from mass market journalism.",1433713955

This is because logical equality in ZF can be forced to be be any equivalence relation, without any additional restriction on the logical constructions. This forces us to add extra axioms saying which sets are ok: countable choice, dependent choice etc. At the extreme end there is the axiom saying all sets have this property, with consequences such as Banach-Tarski and Diaconescu&#x27;s theorem.<p>Type theory introduces nuances, which may not be appreciated by the non-logician (constructiveness, intensionality…). Homotopy type theory goes some way in mitigating this by allowing quotients (but the logical constructions are suitably restricted to preserve choice), and adding function extensionality (not to mention univalence).",1433713484

9676424,comment,9674662,9674662,0,0,Animats,,,"I get the feeling that nobody responding here watched the competition.  Is there a forum where anyone is discussing this subject?<p>Notes:<p>- Everybody using the Atlas robot had stability problems. Nobody seemed to be outside of static stability (base of support under CG) let alone outside of ZMP stability (base of support under CG modified to account for momentum.) Any loss of balance meant a fall. They&#x27;re probably using the basic DLL that Boston Dynamics provided to get teams going.  (One team admitted this.) That has functions &quot;walk slowly&quot;, and &quot;stand maintaining balance using only joints from the hip and below&quot;, plus direct control of joints.  Boston Dynamics has demonstrated much better locomotion control than that, but the teams didn&#x27;t have access to it. (Boston Dynamics supplied the Atlas robots and thus could not compete.) IHMC was working on balance recovery [4] but didn&#x27;t have it working in time.<p>- This is the new Atlas robot, unveiled in January 2015. It&#x27;s still mostly hydraulic, but it&#x27;s now self-powered, with a big battery backpack.  I think there&#x27;s also a hydraulic accumulator in there, so they can recover some energy when running, but nobody at the event went fast enough to gain from that.  Mechanically, that machine is far more capable than it appeared to be in the competition.  It&#x27;s quite capable of picking up objects from the ground, and getting up if it falls. Nobody did either in the competition.  The teams only got these new robots around February, so they really haven&#x27;t had the time to develop software to use them effectively. Right now, the hardware is much better than the software.<p>- Everybody was doing their manipulation by almost pure teleoperation. As soon as DARPA introduced delays into the data links (which they do to penalize teleoperation), the robots spent most of their time stopped. The operators were stuck waiting for enough data to get through to update their screens.  Not much autonomous operation here.  Here&#x27;s the winning team video, sped up about 30x.[2]  Note that although it&#x27;s capable of walking, it was run in kneeling wheel mode almost all the time.  Only for the stair climbing did it walk.<p>- Nobody had combined manipulation and locomotion working at all. That&#x27;s why getting out of the vehicle was so hard - it takes coordinated leg and arm movements.<p>- The CMU team had a partially tracked base, and the NASA/JPL team had a &quot;monkey&quot; robot with rollers at knees and elbows. They both did reasonably well. If you&#x27;re going to teleoperate, a dumber, statically stable robot is easier to deal with. Of the top 3 finishers, only one used an non-wheeled robot, an Atlas. Here&#x27;s their first run, with two falls.[3] Again, this is a 30x speedup. The penalty for a fall or a need for repair was only a 10 minute penalty, not disqualification.<p>- The tasks were dumbed down twice during the project. The original specs called for the robots to have to replace a pump. The final competition only required turning a valve and cutting a hole in very soft material with a power drill.  Basically, the tasks were reduced to the point that they were hard, but not so hard as to lead to total fail.<p>- Schaft did better in the first round back in 2013, but after Google bought them, they were pulled from the competition. Google, remember, now owns Schaft, Boston Dynamics, and several other robotics companies.<p>I look forward to the next competition. If work continues, in a year or two the results should be far better.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27HkxMo6qK0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27HkxMo6qK0</a>

Since he does those things, then he&#x27;s obviously not convinced that human activity affects climate. Interestingly, if he donated the billions in profits he has made from his climate change &quot;investments&quot; then perhaps he could be taken more seriously. Al Gore invests in &quot;green&quot; companies. He uses his platform to scare the world. He becomes a billionaire. He continues living his life exactly as he did before. Anyone that attempts to give Al Gore any credibility whatsoever has none themselves.<p>It&#x27;s interesting because Warren Buffet is often cited by leftists because Buffet supports raising income taxes. See the Buffet secretary story from 2011 where he complained that his secretary pays a higher income tax rate than he does. Interestingly, Buffet did not call for a raising of the capital gains tax -- the form of income from which Buffet derives his wealth. The relevance of this example is that these marquee people that try and influence public policy ALWAYS act rationally towards their own best interests. Al Gore promotes AGW and becomes a billionaire. Buffet suggests raising income taxes to potentially deflect calls to raise capital gains taxes.<p>This &quot;settled science&quot; bullshit is exactly that. No science is &quot;settled,&quot; yet there are those that want to fundamentally alter civilization based on politically-influenced mathematical models. Interestingly, even the IPCC admits that &quot;we redistribute world&#x27;s wealth by climate policy.&quot; Looking at the AGW issue objectively, given all of the scandal, the misrepresentations, the outright lies (i.e. the polar ice cap will be completely gone by 2016,) and the Chicken Little aspects, a person with no political opinions at all would be suspicious. The idea of human-caused global warming has been trumpeted with a zeal equal to that of the Eugenics movement -- and we all know how that turned out.<p>As an example, Charles Davenport had a PhD in biology from Harvard and later was a Harvard professor. He also was the director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. At the time, one could say his scientific credentials were beyond reproach. One of his statements (among others) was, &quot;I believe in such a selection of immigrants as shall not tend to adulterate our national germ plasm with socially unfit traits.&quot; This highly respected scientist helped and supported the Nazis, their scientific programs were based on much of Davenport&#x27;s work. Yet, in 1911, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences because of his eugenics work. Eugenics inspired Margaret Sanger to found Planned Parenthood, not to save society from unwanted pregnancies, but to prevent immigrant &quot;inferiors&quot; from breeding. A member of the National Academy of Sciences who laid the groundwork for the extermination of millions of people. All based on &quot;settled science.&quot;<p>So pardon me if I&#x27;m a bit skeptical when a billionaire politician like Al Gore tries to sell the world a bill of goods. We could argue that divestiture or the elimination of fossil fuels might be &quot;good,&quot; but then again similar arguments for &quot;goodness&quot; were made in the justification eugenics.

However, the centralized Dispatcher is imperatively controlled by Actions, rather than taking the responsibility to observe Actions.<p>This can definitely be disorienting since by default you use imperative APIs to create the actions, and then switch to working with events and subscribers from the dispatcher up until the re-render. I&#x27;ve not had too much difficulty with this, at least after some initial confusion.<p>> Flux dictates that inter-model dependency should live in the Dispatcher, but in MVI, those dependencies are defined inside each Model.<p>Maybe this should be edited. Flux stores are the analog of models, and each store can define which other stores have to finish updating before it responds to a given action (in that big case statement where it registers with the dispatcher).<p>The arguments for RxJS, testable view functions, and avoiding internal component state are important. The dispatcher being a singleton doesn&#x27;t seem to affect much in practice, since that code is never really touched. Looks like performance could be better with virtual-dom but I&#x27;d be interested to see the different optimization strategies for each architecture and how they affect performance.

If you use reserve() incorrectly, you can actually trigger quadratic complexity (as I&#x27;ve done in the past when I didn&#x27;t know any better). Even with unused capacity, vector is quite space-efficient. For example, with GCC&#x27;s 2x growth, on average a vector will be using 33% extra space (that&#x27;s 0.5/1.5). With VC&#x27;s 1.5x growth, on average a vector will be using 20% extra space (that&#x27;s 0.25/1.25). That&#x27;s a pretty small cost to pay for vector&#x27;s optimal locality.

But it&#x27;s important to remember that the vast majority of people (a number around 90%) who go to university (even expensive private ones) here in the U.S. manage to navigate this system and go on to productive, non-bankrupt lives after graduation.<p>It would be better if it was 100% of course, but it&#x27;s not like most people leave school and have to fight a desperate battle against debtors. For most people it&#x27;s just a temporary drag on their income that gets paid off relatively quickly if they earn enough to pay over the minimum.<p>The reason it sort of quasi-works in the U.S., but seems inconceivable in Europe, is likely the differences in the labor markets. In general the U.S. doesn&#x27;t have the same kinds of problems (or as severe) with youth employment and underemployment.

To categorize circumstances like student loan default in to these buckets -- sole victim vs sole culpability -- is to create a false dichotomy. Not saying you are, but arguments like these tend to polarize to these two endpoints quickly.<p>At one point in my career, I worked for a bankruptcy trustee. During that time, I learned some very valuable lessons about creditors and the importance of bankruptcy/default on lending practices. If a lender knows that a debt cannot be defaulted upon and absolved through bankruptcy, their risks are substantially mitigated. They&#x27;re not eliminated, but again, this about understanding the scales of risk and fault as it relates to credit.<p>Outside of student loans, most credit is obtained through a process that involves the lending institution weighing the risk that the debtor will be unable to pay. The ultimate risk being that the debtor will file bankruptcy, and the creditor will take a serious haircut on their principal.<p>With student loans, our policy is guided by the principal that higher education is of monumental importance. Rather than simply make universities part of our public education system -- because government = bad, amirite? -- a set of policies and law making resulted in a system of federally sanctioned/backed lending institutions which were granted special status within the context of the creditor/debtor relationship. Over time, these special affordances have been extended to private lenders who adhere to regulations.<p>And here we are today. Capital has identified this loophole and is leveraging student debtors&#x27; future in ways that is clearly predatory. With no risk of bankruptcy, student loan creditors are empowered to garnish wages at rates up to 25%. What lender wouldn&#x27;t take that deal? How much would you loan someone if you knew you could take a quarter of their paycheck every week for the rest of their life?<p>Clearly the debtor holds responsibility to use credit responsibly, but you can&#x27;t create circumstances like the ones we have today and fall back to &quot;Well, everyone really should just be more responsible.&quot; No, we all hold responsibility for the system that we&#x27;ve created, and until it changes, things will only get worse.",1433711556

What differentiates it from the 37 other semi-premium burger joints that have boomed in the last decade, like Five Guys.<p>Here&#x27;s the answer: they&#x27;re not all that special. They&#x27;re providing a quality service, and people get bored of the same-old same-old Starbucks & Co. or typical fast-food burger (even the nicer ones).<p>These are massive physical industries. The physical services world doesn&#x27;t lend itself to the easy monopolization that you see in software / Internet. Meaning, there is a lot of space for other competitors. Starbucks owns 25%-30% of their segment depending on which metrics you use, after all of these years and their vast success. Dunkin has another ~15% or so. I&#x27;d say 60% of the market is available to be fought over (much like in burgers, start-ups can absolutely steal back share from Starbucks).<p>Companies like Shake Shack, Blue Bottle, Pinkberry, and a zillion others, also play to the human desire to find new, trendy things to experience; the desire to not do what everyone else is doing; to seek out a different culture, or simply a slightly different tasting cup of coffee. That desire is perpetual, it will never cease, and that will also constantly break down dominant players over time (eg: McDonald&#x27;s is rotting).",1433711165

Welcome to the 21st century, where it usually takes some effort to find the truth in controversial issues.<p>One thing to keep in mind while digging in, we know there is a financial incentive behind pro-fluoridation studies (it is expensive for business to dispose of it). As far as I know, there isn&#x27;t much financial incentive in being against fluoridation, save for some boutique toothpaste brands that would probably lack the resources to conduct peer reviewed studies.",1433711029

Initial thoughts would be that we could get some free community translations from people who are watching it via sites like subscene.com and opensubtitle.org. Another idea would be to actually join the pirate bay and ask that if you&#x27;re not going to buy the movie could you at least spread the word, and hope for a sale through word of mouth to friends and family.

8044573,comment,8044029,8044478,3,0,randomdata,,,"Definitely. We looked into adding RTK autosteer to our tractors a few years ago. It was about $10,000 to get into a full autosteer system per machine, plus recurring costs for the correction data, which seems to be the preferred way to go. That just to drive straight. The systems that can handle turning on the headlands or synchronize between machines run even higher, at least at the time. We decided it wasn&#x27;t feasible for our operation and haven&#x27;t reevaluated.<p>However, if you can completely replace an operator as a tiny autonomous combine could, costs of that magnitude become negligible.",1405544812

Often there is a one hour default in order to be reasonably nice to the server. Basically, a Craigslist RSS item is just a URL with the search parameters embedded. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but I suspect that whenever you fetch this URL, the server executes the search and produces the results as RSS XML items, so the fetch rate is controlled by you (your reader).  Or are you saying there is some additional throttling on the server side, so that RSS-based searches do not see up-to-the-second updates that are visible through the Web interface? So that no matter how often you refresh the RSS feed, you don&#x27;t see new items that are already visible via HTML?",1405544459

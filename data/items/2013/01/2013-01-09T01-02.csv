I can say unequivocally that despite its problems, socialized medicine (the Canadian system) is far superior to what I experienced in the U.S.. In Canada, I need health services, I go get it. Period. In the U.S., I have to make sure I go to the right doctor, deal with the insurance company, worry about weather the insurance company will actually pay, pick the right health plan in advance when I have little idea what I will need, et cetera. All of this when I am sick or injured and have bigger things to be worrying about.<p>I am not absolutely certain that socialized medicine is better than free market medicine, but the U.S. does not have a free market, they have a complex socialized system run by private insurance companies. The easiest thing to do would be to cut out the insurance companies and fund health care on a state or federal level (i.e. make a state run insurance company the single payer). Yes, taxes will go up, but again, in my experience, the percentage of my paycheque that was withheld was exactly the same in Canada and the U.S.. In Canada, it was called taxes while in the U.S., it was called an insurance premium. There was effectively no difference. Now, I know this solution is politically difficult as it puts private companies out of business, but it is far better for the people both individually and collectively to just plain not have to worry about healthcare.",1357695015

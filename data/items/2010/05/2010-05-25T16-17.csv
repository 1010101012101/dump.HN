Are we to protect people from the dangers of superficial levels of knowledge by keeping them ignorant?  Teach them, and if that's not enough, then teach them more:<p>""Mispredicted branches can cause a conditional itself to run about 10 times slower.  In very tight loops, this can be a problem, but most of the time this effect isn't even measurable.

1377784,comment,1376911,1377387,0,0,yellowbkpk,,,"> You can thank me for subsidizing that low cost with my Boston - NYC trips which cost well over $100 each way. Often you can fly from Boston to LaGuardia for less than the train. High fares on the east coast routes subsidize those cheap cross country ""named"" trains.<p>Thanks, but federal and state tax dollars are also a major subsidy source (especially on the Empire Builder which is one of the main sources of tourists for Idaho/Wyoming/etc.).<p>> Pro tip: Never buy a ticket on a named train i.e. ""Empire Builder"", ""Vermonter"" when just trying to get between cities - they are frequently many hours late.<p>You're right, but they've been getting better. Especially since winter, when the weather wreaked havoc on the system. See <a href=""http://www.trainweb.org/capt/AmtrakMapsForward.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trainweb.org/capt/AmtrakMapsForward.html</a> for ""real time"" calculated location of the trains and how late they are.<p>> Oh, and that Verizon wireless commercial that shows a guy spotting a good looking girl already on a train and he quickly changes his ticket using his smart phone; that can't be done, not even with a voice call. To change an Amtrak ticket you have to physically take the ticket to a ticket window.<p>I've changed tickets several times over the phone and online. They ask you to go to the counter to verify ID, but if you swipe your card at the FasTrak station you can get the new ticket printed just fine.<p>> Just about every time I take Amtrak I get pissed-off by the high cost and indifferent service.<p>I've had the exact opposite experience. On the Empire Builder, the staff is always courteous (even to unruly passengers) and is genuinely interested in the wellbeing of the passengers. I've made friends with some of the workers at the smaller Amtrak stations along the EB route -- they make for great conversation when you're waiting for the train.",1274804190

I was in Atlanta last weekend, staying near the Cumberland Mall while going to a conference in Midtown, and didn't know about Cobb County Transit until I saw a bus. It wasn't on GMaps, while MARTA was. Now I know that when I visit a city I haven't been to, I ought to check more than just GMaps.<p>Of course, that wasn't the only mistake I made while planning. If I'd booked my hotel sooner, I could have got a nice place, within walking distance to the conference, at a reasonable price.<p>I like this article because it reminds me that planning can be fun, isn't really that hard, and can help a great deal. It sounds like Stammy got a much nicer place than he would have if he didn't reply to new listings. It was also smart to get in-building laundry. My current place in Boulder has me going to the laundromat, and it's much more of a distraction than I thought it would be, even if I pay them to do my laundry. It makes me take my car on days when I'd much rather be on foot or on a bike.<p>...and I concur about grocery stores being important. Boulder has three stores I like to frequent really close to each other: Whole Foods, Vitamin Cottage, and Sunflower Market. Each has their strong points. Whole Foods has <i>everything</i> and a great salad bar and deli; Vitamin Cottage has only organic produce, with better prices than Whole Foods, and Sunflower often has the best prices town on both organic and non-organic produce.",1274803984

If users were the customers Facebook would have avoided this whole mess. Assuming a reasonable $10/month per power user, a conversion rate of 2-3%, at 500 million users they'd be generating $1.2-$1.8 billion in high-margin revenue. Instead, users are the product. Advertisers are the customers. And Facebook is generating maybe $1B in lower-margin revs. Admittedly the growth prospects of being the big display advertising/lead gen platform are better than being the leading social network.<p>On the other hand, isn't this great for HN users?

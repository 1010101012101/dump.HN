But, I really don't get the appeal of Facebook (this is probably why I do systems management apps instead of social network thingies).<p>I do know, however, that many large companies have historically paid very large amounts of money to know as much about people as Facebook got people to volunteer to give them.  There probably is significant value in this information.  It's stupid to think that the #2 social network is worth 30 times the #1 social network, but it'd also be dumb to wholly discount the value of all of that data.",1208853986

And, you stated that 80% of Windows systems are running entirely pirated software, which is, frankly, a ridiculous claim.<p>Paint Shop Pro isn't b2b.  It's the epitome of consumer software.  Businesses buy Photoshop.<p>I'm not arguing piracy doesn't exist among Windows users, I'm arguing that you're being smug about being an exalted and holy Mac user which makes you uniquely capable of judging quality and uniquely honest enough to pay for the software you use--unlike the riff raff using other operating systems.  Sorry you don't like the term...but that's smug.<p>I'll admit to being smug and thinking, like you, that Windows users are idiots.  But, I take it one further and think that Mac users are idiots, too (and they paid too damned much for their computer to boot).  Likewise for most Linux users.  Users, in general, are idiots.",1208852844

If you are already 50, you obviously haven't died from some disease in your 30ies, like inheritable cancer.<p>The reason it doesn't work the other way round could be that for men, the quality of the genes of their mates don't matter so much: just get as many children out there as possible, some are bound to be OK (it is not as high an investment as it is for women).<p>Still puzzling why women can't bear children up to a higher age - forgot why that was.

While it would be great if Facebook users were interested in education themed apps, they are not. Just have them make apps based on things they wish they could do on Facebook. Crazy and stupid ideas can actually work, so mind as well not focus them in the wrong direction. The more times they get to try these ideas, the more they will learn what works and what does not.<p>Successful apps so far are all about connecting people in different ways and allowing self-expression, so that should be emphasized. Multi-player games are also getting big. From what I've seen, tools have not been so successful.<p>Since presumably not all the users will be adept at design, giving them a run through of various interface/design elements of Facebook's design would help in making better apps that users become comfortable with faster.<p>Facebook's platform has a number of different bugs and quirks (like its crazy implementation of Javascript) which merit discussion.<p>Don't forget to talk about other services like OpenSocial, even if it's a Facebook class.",1208852718

170408,comment,168636,170336,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My understanding of what you considered the benevolence of Microsoft was that they allowed a low-cost IBM PC compatible computer market to develop, which allowed people who wouldn't have been able to afford a PC to do so.  Apple has never been accused of being a low-cost, or even affordable, computer supplier (and the existence of a used market doesn't invalidate that--a used PC running Windows XP or, better in my opinion, Linux is going to be even cheaper and within reach of more people).  If the dramatically lowered price point for a personal computer was not the benevolence of Microsoft, according to your argument, and the price of a personal computer doesn't matter to your argument, then I will humbly stand corrected.  Though I think I'll need some clarification about what the benevolence of Microsoft was, if not that, as I'm drawing a blank on anything else good that came out of Redmond.<p>But, all that I actually <i>said</i> to start with was that I was amused that you praised Apple...the earlier criticism of IBMs abuse of power and the benevolence of Microsoft in breaking down the IBM monopoly made for an amusing contrast to me, an outsider who generally uses neither Apple nor Microsoft products and doesn't really consider Mac OS X a significantly superior OS to Windows Vista or XP.  I don't really care which is ""better"" in this discussion, as ""better"" wasn't a qualification for Microsoft's benevolence.<p>I found it amusing, that's all.  I really didn't mean to stir up so much argument about it.  If I were the type that used smileys, I would have included one in my first post...but I figured ""amusing"" would cover it.  ;-)",1208852215

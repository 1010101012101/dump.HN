4821003,comment,4820599,4820914,6,0,WildUtah,,,"Yes, I have been in taxis in Mexico City at night. Many times in many different parts of the city I have procured the services of taxis of all kinds for decades. All of my experiences have been fine and I've never been terrified, scared, concerned, attacked, robbed, worried, or kidnapped in any way.<p>I have been overcharged, though. It happens less now that I speak the language fluently but I can't change the fact that I'm an obvious foreigner. The city does not regulate nighttime fares.<p>If you are concerned, get a ""sitio"" taxi from one of the thousands of convenient taxi stands that check on and track their drivers and cars. It costs a little more but provides rock solid security.<p>You should never have any trouble with Mexico City transit of any kind except personal cars; driving yourself is insane in a city of 24 million. The transit system, from taxis to subways, is clean, cheap, innovative, reliable, and efficient with an excellent worldwide reputation.<p>That is accomplished with a network of private regulations (taxi sitios), fully public systems (subway, bus rapid transit), minimal public regulation (taxi licensing), cooperatives of private contractors (minibuses), privatized toll roads, and public streets. As an operators, you can choose the level of regulation you want to operate under and then operate the corresponding kind of transit you want your business or career to involve. Diversity works much better than monopoly of the type being mandated in Vancouver or NYC.",1353646125

But the status quo's long term experience with enforcing a monopoly through laws/regulations, etc, will make it really hard for Uber.  Uber will need to spend a great deal of time and energy trying to get those laws to change, which will likely be at a glacial pace, if ever.<p>I'm sure there's a huge amount of interest for this in SF, and taxi service is so bad, you might even be able to make this an election issue.

Certainly worse than the bloody alternative you paint, yes. Americans who agree with their own founding principles certainly should think so. The argument in favour of the Saudi regime is that there would be too much violence if the people were not repressed by a totalitarian feudal theocracy? Stability over liberty? Which side you would have been on in the revolutionary war?<p>You are also completely glossing over the fact that the majority of the anti-american sentiment in the middle east is strongly tied to the fact that the US has military bases in Holy Land specifically to defend a feudal theocracy that oppresses the very people who are angry. No need for the bases if you stop supporting them. It's a few too many CIA backed oppressive regimes to expect things to change overnight but if you actually care about the amount of anti-western hate in the middle east the first step is probably to stop siding with the people oppressing them.<p>I'm not convinced by the holiest sites in Islam under threat to ""western-backed"" fighters narrative. They are currently not under threat, but under the literal control of western backed armies. Between the Saudi's and Israel and the current american controlled government in Iraq <i>all</i> major holy sites in Islam (Sunni and Shia) <i>are</i> controlled by American backed powers. ""Under threat"" would be an <i>improvement</i>.<p>Also the current policy is unapologetically expansionist, not stonewalling at all.",1353645616

Schools in India have generally a 75% attendance norm.<p>I used to work in an office with a headcount of 20000.

The point that we didn't have nearly the observational capacity a couple of hundred years ago that we have today is well made, we certainly might have dodged a bullet, we have seen two comments hit the bigger planets (Jupiter and Saturn) but we only noticed because we were looking.<p>So I share the skepticism that this was a Comet in 1883 but I don't doubt for a moment comets have come that close to the planet.",1353644225

I wonder how much convincing insurance companies would need to offer this to consumers.  Maybe there is some reason they don't think it would be a very good deal for them, or maybe they simply haven't perceived a demand and haven't bothered offering/advertising it as a result.  Perhaps worth looking into, if you have enough assets already that a lawsuit would present a large concern.",1353644031

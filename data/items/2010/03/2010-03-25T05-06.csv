I don't find anything unreasonable about that; I occasionally run into situations where it's just not possible to get the performance needed while <i>only</i> using the DB, as does probably anyone who's worked enough with databases.<p>The specific case -- IIRC -- Digg mentioned was a query which required MySQL to generate a temporary table too large to sit in memory, so it ended up being done on disk. Moving some of the processing out of the DB query and into PHP avoided that, understandably resulting in a huge performance difference (in-memory versus on-disk has a way of doing that...).",1269496770

In October of 2009 AT&T unilaterally (maybe after seeing how the FCC was thinking) amended their customer agreements to allow VOIP over the cellular network. Once that camel nose came under the tent the difference between VOIP phones and the builtin phone started to go away. Now in March of 2010 Line2 has been altered and accepted to deliver VOIP on the cellular network.<p>As submitted, Google Voice had several problems, including a massive privacy violation that would have held up any app. It is reasonable to think that they could have worked through those. The ""duplicates the dialer, voicemail, and SMS"" seems to be the key objection that Google could not, or chose not, to work around, but at least for voice calls that is changing as evidenced by Line2.

It's not that you could die at any moment over extended periods...I came to grips with my own mortality on the flight to my first combat deployment.  It's not seeing people die, most times we weren't sure if the lack of shooting was because they were dead, out of bullets, or trying to draw us out.  It's not the sickening, overwhelming, stomach churning smell of the pools of blood.  It's not that you are taking another life.  For me, the biggest impact was the realization that I had to do my job, perfectly, or someone else would needlessly die.  And my own life relied upon another person doing their job perfectly.  You don't pull the trigger to stay alive, you pull the trigger so that the people keeping you alive stay alive.  You don't question if the fight needs to happen...it just is happening, and your options is you and your squad dies or the enemy and their squad dies.  There's no higher purpose, no moral agenda, no feelings, no dreaming of home.  Eventually, the adrenaline wears off, but you can't even tell because you're basically numb to its affects.<p>And when you get back, even years later, people ask you about it.  And you think up a couple of cheeky stories, but don't even try to tell most people what it's like because words can't accurately communicate the experience.  You just continue on enjoying things in life everyone else discards as annoyances or commonplace.<p>Note:  It's been a few years since I got out and I'm perfectly fine, well adjusted, no related problems, no PTSD, no nightmares, minor paranoia occassionally.

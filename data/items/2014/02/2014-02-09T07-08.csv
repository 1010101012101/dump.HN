7204794,comment,7204419,7204760,10,0,patio11,,,"There exists a lot of literature about class, which is a very fluid term.  I think to the extent that people react really negatively when you suggest $100k is upper class, they&#x27;re reacting to other associations they have with that term.  For example, educational attainment or social advantage are also class markers, and many people at $100k won&#x27;t particularly have them.  For another, material advantages of being wealthy are, at many locales, absolutely unobtainable at only $100k a year.  House ownership is a major one.  International travel is another one that is high on the SWPL list, which many people who are doing well for themselves at $100k a year will not find themselves able to consume.  (Chiefly, because in return for that $100k they&#x27;ve committed themselves to a career track which doesn&#x27;t tolerate 2 week vacations very well.)<p>FWIW, there&#x27;s a lot of talk in the United States since about 1970 or so of there being a &quot;professional class&quot;, which has education and income markedly higher than the traditional middle class but which has lifestyles which resemble middle class more than the traditional upper classes.  It was traditionally filled full of doctors, lawyers, and accountants.  Engineers are entering the professional class, which discomfits a lot of people.",1391932470

In 2012 it was already $560K.<p>And the definition for upper class as being top 1% is arbitrary, it is in fact invented by Obama during his first presidential campaign, solely for finger-pointing (he could safely say 1% is not many people so they won&#x27;t impact election results enough and safe to be finger-pointed).<p>Upper class are ought to be people who don&#x27;t derive their income from work, but from their property - business profits, stock dividends, rent etc. - in all societies upper class are those who DON&#x27;T depend on salary, and many of them don&#x27;t work at all. So it is natural to define upper class income threshold as a point above which less than 50% of income comes from employment. In the present United States, this is about 3-4 million bucks a year per household. This will be economically defined upper class, not just some &#x27;people rich enough to hate them&#x27;. So McCain was closer to reality back in 2008 is his upper class definition.<p>I personally don&#x27;t know anyone making that much, but i can safely say that all people i know making 150-1000k a year will be broke months or at most, a year or two if they stop working, with one exception (a guy living in East Asia with about 400k of annual income, who never married or had kids). So they are not upper class. And i am speaking of the places which are cheaper and have lower living standards than USA.",1391932146

I think a takeaway from the whole Flappy Bird saga is that delivering on the MVP is what matters, not necessarily how polished it is. Flappy Bird simply had a lot more latitude to be unpolished due to cost and what it was promising.

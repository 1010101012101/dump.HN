Samuel H. Preston & Jessica Ho<p>Abstract: ""Life expectancy in the United States fares poorly in international comparisons, primarily because of high mortality rates above age 50. Its low ranking is often blamed on a poor performance by the health care system rather than on behavioral or social factors. This paper presents evidence on the relative performance of the US health care system using death avoidance as the sole criterion. We find that, by standards of OECD countries, the US does well in terms of screening for cancer, survival rates from cancer, survival rates after heart attacks and strokes, and medication of individuals with high levels of blood pressure or cholesterol. We consider in greater depth mortality from prostate cancer and breast cancer, diseases for which effective methods of identification and treatment have been developed and where behavioral factors do not play a dominant role. We show that the US has had significantly faster declines in mortality from these two diseases than comparison countries. We conclude that the low longevity ranking of the United States is not likely to be a result of a poorly functioning health care system.""",1262476146

February 17, 2009<p>ABSTRACT<p>When I first visited the Palestinian territories, I was afraid I would have to hide my identity as an American and possibly wear a headscarf. To my surprise, I was warmly welcomed exactly as I was, and after more than two years living and working there, it remains one of my favorite spots on earth. The people are charming and generous, the landscape is gorgeous, and the parties, concerts, and beer gardens in Ramallah are world-class.<p>But behind all this looms the conflict, the occupation, and violence. Since September 2000, more than 5,500 Palestinians and 1,100 Israelis have been killed. A series of walls, fences, roadblocks, checkpoints, army bases, and settlements keep the Palestinians in the West Bank under an almost constant state of siege and strangle the economy of many towns and villages, including Bethlehem. Gaza has been turned into an open-air prison whose desperate inmates can only get vital supplies through smuggling tunnels -- which also transport weapons that Palestinian militants use to target Israeli civilians.<p>Using photographs, stories, and statistics, this presentation colors in the Palestinian experience, with all its complexity and contradictions, as it is rarely shown on the news or in books. It is a fascinating world of beauty and terror, of hospitality and homicide, of the absurd and the sublime constantly together -- a microcosmic view of a little-understood human story with global implications.<p>Speaker: Pamela Olson
Pamela Olson graduated from Stanford in 2002 with a major in physics. She lived in Ramallah, West Bank, for a year and a half beginning in the summer of 2004 and worked as a journalist for the Palestine Monitor. She interviewed the first elected female mayor in the West Bank, witnessed the 2005 Disengagement from inside the Gaza Strip, and served as the foreign press coordinator for Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi's Presidential campaign against Mahmoud Abbas in January 2005. She later worked for a year at the Institute for Defense Analyses in Washington, DC. She is now writing a book about her time in the West Bank called Fast Times in Palestine.",1262475949

That is a position I cannot agree with. There are practical concerns about the sustainability of the GPL model in terms of economics.<p>Programmers can not work for free. The usual claim that GPL proponents make is either ""sell service, not software"" or the ransom model where you GPL source only after you collect X amount for the production of it. They are interesting claims, but far from proven on a large scale.<p>When I write code and wish to give it out for free, I want it to be available for all times and all models of work. What happens if it is one day determined that having all source under a GPL model is simply not sustainable in a realistic setting? That code is now locked forever into that model. For larger projects, it is impractical to track down every single committer in order to change the license.<p>I even question the idea in terms of attracting new developers. How many people really start writing GPL code because of the existing base of software rather than because they agree with the idea of the GPL?

So if you buy your own penicillin, it's with after tax money, but if your insurance company buys it, it's pre-tax money. That's one of the reasons that health insurance is so widespred in America even for routine medicine like antibiotics and checkups. That's a major contributing factor in why the administrative costs are so high.<p>2. There's a shortage of doctors in America, and qualified doctors from other countries are not allowed to practice medicine in the United States. So there's good doctors from Canada, England, Japan, wherever that'd love to practice in the USA, but can't. This artificially inflates doctor's wages by restricting supply.<p>3. American doctors are typically required to get an undergraduate degree, medical degree, and do a below market, crazy hours residency in order to be able to practice medicine. That's 8-10 years of study and below market working to practice medicine. Now, medicine is very important and needs to be done right, but I don't believe for a second that a focused apprenceship couldn't teach a very specific kind of medicine - say arithscopic surgery - in just 2-4 years under a highly trained doctor, but this isn't an option.<p>4. The Food and Drug Administration requires new drugs to be proven not only for safety, but also efficacy. That's an incredibly high and expensive burden to meet - that means that drugs need to be proven to work to a certain standard, instead of just not harm. This adds years of development time and millions of dollars in cost to the new drug development cycle.<p>Those are all legislated reasons that increase the cost of medical insurance, doctors, and drugs. They'd be fairly easy to remove -<p>1. All medical and health expenses can be written off taxes regardless of insurance. Employees can choose to convert som of their wages to a medical or health plan tax free to both the employer and employee. (Currently, under most circumstances, only employer-provided health insurance can is tax free)<p>2. Allow any doctor in a country with reasonably competent medical standards to practice in the United States.<p>3. Require that doctors be able to demonstrate that they can practice their area of medicine capably. Be flexible in how they demonstrate that. Note: This will incur high opposition from medical schools and current doctors who are currently enjoying the wage premium and had to go through the very long, difficult, and expensive system.<p>4. Change the drug standard from ""safety and efficacy"" to only safety. Drugs will come to market much faster and cheaper. There's plenty of people and organizations that will test proven safe drugs for efficacy for free or nominal cost once drugs hit market, and efficacy will get understood with time. Put this way - a proven safe but questionably effective treatment against heart disease being held off the market for five years and costing much more to get to market is not a good thing. If it's certainly safe, then let people make the decisions with their physicians, instead of having the FDA take such a strong gatekeeping stance.<p>Technology has progressed such that we don't need government protection from ourselves as much any more. The current set of legislation has greatly increased the costs of doctors and medicine. Regardless of political position, and regardless of stance on other health issues, addressing these four points will make the medical system fairer, more effective, and and less expensive with relative ease.<p>Admittedly, there's some powerful entrenched interests that are winning in the current arrangement, and will oppose these simple improvements.",1262474401

It probably cost you quite a bit, but that's the name of the game. You can't know until you try (well that's what I keep telling myself these days).<p>You're right that the combination of friends and work especially is a delicate one, something that I did not foresee either (working on my first big project).<p>Also I agree with your advice, about needing co-founders that are as engaged as you are. However this is a very hard thing to achieve. Not everyone is as crazy as we are. And communicating a vision is a very hard thing to do as well.<p>Although it might not seem so for someone with not much prior experience with coding, the simplest thing to do is still to have a go at it alone, at least in a first stage. It's probably easier and less risky than managing a team to execute your crazy idea for you.<p>Anyway, don't leave us hanging! What is the url of your website?",1262474308

(2) The lifestyles of Americans that may have nothing at all to do with healthcare implementation (<a href=""http://www.usnews.com/health/family-health/articles/2008/04/22/obesitys-link-to-life-expectancy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/health/family-health/articles/2008/04/...</a>) - ie this could very well mean that if the US miraculously grew an entirely public and universal healthcare system as modeled against XYZ country, US life expectancy might not necessarily get any cheaper or better - it is entirely possible that it would become more expensive and worse.",1262473820

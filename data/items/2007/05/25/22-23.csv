24710,comment,24664,24664,0,0,sabat,,,"Sigh. Maybe I just don't get it [tm]. Everything on the Google side sounded way more appealing than everything on the Meetup side. Maybe it's just the way I'm drawn.<p>Oh, and especially that thing about how having a view of three (ugly) bridges from some skyscraper is way cooler than playing hackeysack in the googleplex. Uh, ok, dude has apparently never actually been to California. For me, I'll take beautiful year-round weather with fun-loving googlers over crappy weather with hard-nosed, fast-talking meetup stress cases who get to look out over some ... um ... bridges.",1180133540

But it seems like the rate of new frontpage-worthy stories has slowed down.  This might be because those who visited for YC's winter cycle left, since posting on News.YC was an incentive to get accepted.<p>If it has slowed down then that's very odd.  This is a great community.  I'd be interested to see the daily page view counts / submission counts over the last month or two.<p>Shawn",1180130838

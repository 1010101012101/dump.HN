We did manage to get it to 3% of each order + $10k balance, ""PayPal will retain in your PayPal account a minimum balance of $10,000 USD and 3% of the net proceeds of each payment received into your account for a rolling period of 90 days ending on the current date.""<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who refuse to pay without paypal, so we were forced to accept this in order to stay in business.<p>It utterly sucks because it takes any kind of risk from paypals back and puts it in the sellers.<p>P.S: it doesn't have anything to do with accepting credit cards, they do this every time you hit a large sales volume aka when they assign a 'dedicated paypal manager' to you.<p>Update: i remember at the time they put a reserve on us we digged in and calculated, figured out paypal holds about $300 mil for 90 days with it's new system, they probably get serious interest from that money, yet we see none, what if the currency goes down in those 90 days and i get to lose a large amount?

A merchant processing through them still needs to obtain a traditional merchant account, and therefore exposes their business to the same risk of having a reserve assessed on their account. If Feefighters is acting as an ISO (merchant account servicer / reseller), they can perhaps cushion the blow delivered to merchants in these cases, but likely not by much.<p>Stripe allows businesses to process on their merchant account, similar to how PayPal works. This removes the direct impact of a reserve, but if Stripe observes behavior that could increase their exposure to risk, I'm sure they will take action.

Similar things in the world are stored with similar representations, so that the brain can generalize, and see commonalities. This is not a graph - graphs are discretized - this is much more flexible.<p>- Even the acts of storage and retrieval are themselves a kind of computation, a transformation, a compression and a learning experience.<p>- Memories are not clean silos. Storing a new memory can subtly (and not so subtly) affect other nearby or related memories<p>- Different parts of the brain use different storage parameters. For instance, the hippocampus is like a hash table, storing each memory relatively cleanly and in isolation, but can only be accessed with exactly the cue. In contrast, the cortex stores memories in a much more content-addressable, overlapping way that's invariant to many small differences (e.g. we can recognize a face whether it's rotated, sunny, tanned, close up, obscured).",1318080912

There's quite a bit of varied experience on the same root(& their storage) happening multiple times and layers within.<p>Content that gets shared/liked more, gets replicated, re-iterated on, transformed, re-tagged.
As time progresses, you'll find more content similar to the parent, being generated -- re-experienced via dreams and the subconscious.<p>Eventually, when its necessary to dig out the piece of content using tags or searches, it'll end up finding the most 'linked-to' piece. Possibly one that was associated with a explosion of favorable chemicals.<p>-----<p>There's some evidence to suggest that the same experience, isn't stored as a single piece of memory. During the process of consolidation [when a long term memory gets etched], the 'experience' being transcribed goes through iterations. With variations being stored as well, some of them decaying almost instantly.<p>It's possible the brain applies 'instagram' like filters while etching these memories.

I'd hear someone talking and first hear it as unintelligible sound, then I'd be aware of the sounds being broken down into separate sound units, and then recognized as English words, and then the relationships between the words being recognized, and then I'd become aware of the meaning of what I'd heard.<p>I also had a time during that trip where I was watching visual processing. I'd be aware of how my mind was noticing things in the scene I was looking at, recognizing objects and remembering what they were, and combining that to build an understanding of the scene.<p>Now I have no way of knowing how much of this was just hallucinations shaped by my knowledge of computers, and how much really was the LSD actually letting me observe consciously mental processes that normally operate as black boxes to the conscious.<p>It's too bad research using LSD was greatly curtailed when the drug was banned. My suspicion is that what I perceived on that trip was a mix of reality and hallucinations driven by my computer knowledge.

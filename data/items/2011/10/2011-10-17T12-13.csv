The cost of housing, health care, and education has certainly skyrocketed.

At a previous company I worked for, each executive had his/her own scheduling and appointment secretary. While that may have been necessary back in the day before easy-to-use, syncable-with-your-mobile-device calendars were developed, the jobs that managed such tasks were the first on the chopping block. In fact, those jobs only continued to exist because it was more of a (emotional/sentimental) cost to cut them than to just keep them.<p>After the company trimmed heavily during recession and bosses got used to doing their own calendars there was no justifying hiring for these secretarial positions again.

How come 50 million americans are without jobs?<p>Is it not, perhaps, the case that the situation was such that these jobs would have been created anyway? My complaint is this.<p>There are 400 rich people. There are jobs. You attribute a causal relationship.<p>I say, you could have killed every one of these 400 at birth, and we would still have the jobs (and to be clear I am not advocating doing that at all, I'm just making a hypothetical argument)<p>Now you might say that it is not these 400 individuals that matter, but that in any system with jobs, there would be 400 people at the top, and these people would have more wealth.<p>However, it is the ""how much more wealth"" that is the complaint. Not that there are 400 of them. The complaint is not that these specific 400 people are the problem. Nor that any such 400 would be the problem. The complaint is that a system that allows for the top 400 people to have such a disparate amount of wealth compared to the other 300 million is a fucked system.<p>To argue that without these 400 people, or any such 400 people, there would be higher unemployment is rubbish. That ""we are better off because they existed"".<p>Fuck you, frankly.<p>Indeed, its more likely that the richest 400 actively act to prevent individuals from gaining wealth and power that can threaten their own. As the feudal system collapsed, small businesses flourished. In order to maintain control, the ruling classes established laws requiring tradesmen to join guilds and pay fees. In the UK for example, guilds had to be recognized by the monarch.<p>In modern times, these guilds have been replaced by rules and regulations that have the same effect, but their justification is the same: ""its in the public interest"". Just as you couldn't buy cloth from a non-guild weaver in the 15th century - because it might not be good quality - so now you can't buy a car from Tesla unless Tesla pays millions of dollars for crash testing, or buys a design from an incumbent.<p>Similarly, patent lawyers. Accountants. That new iPhone app that records your heart rate? Want FDA approval for that? Want to be hit with a lawsuit for a covered medical device that you released without FDA approval? (because they are covered).<p>I'm not saying that a capitalist world run by a species that is happy to bomb its own offspring could be any different. I'm just saying don't fucking pretend that we owe them any praise. They get away with as much as they can just short of us rising up and killing them.",1318855332

They steal money from publishers!!",,"If you want to see my open letter to Google about jump down to last page read that..<p>I am speaking not only for myself but also for others..This is all about Google Adsense's banning of publishers and poor customer support..<p>About myself: I am a small adsense publishers for 5 years,Only during the last 4 months I have started earning about $100 per month and when the account was disabled it had already $95+$30.
Two of my sites had page views of over 100,000 with some 25000 unique visitors per month (Most of the visitors are from Google)<p>""On Saturday all of a sudden,I got  a  mail from Google stating that your adsense account has been disabled as your Adsense account poses a risk of generating a invalid activity""<p>Stop? invalid activity? me? I always believe there is little chance for invalid activity on my site as most of the visitors are from Google search.So whether Adsense thinks that most of the visitors from Google search are bots? It prompts me to think whether Google itself has bots to click on the ads or inflate the visitor count for a site and get them banned..???Because almost all my visitors are genuine visitors ..<p>How come google knows my account poses a risk of generating a invalid activity? How they deduce it?Whether they are spying on me to  know that ""I am planning some click fraud/invalid activity  with my friends?""
How all of a sudden they conclude that my account poses a  risk when they didn't found that during last 5 years..?<p>What is the risk of invalid activity? I wish to know why they are hiding something from the publishers? They are also banning publishers like me without any reason giving some lame excuses like the one above..when there is no invalid activity.??? What is the invalid activity they are speaking about? I think they are just banning publishers randomly to acheive their monthly target and I think they won't be refunding the money to advertises (Most of the publishers are banned only between 15-20 of a month because that's when they finalize the checks that are being sent to the publishers..)<p>They say that once the account is disabled the money is returned to the advertisers.. Whether anyone has bothered to check whether Google actually refunds all the money to advertisers? I think Google is 
inflating their revenue by keeping the money to themselves..they may be returning only a part of money back to advertisers as an eyewash to prevent any kind of investigation into that..(No one has done some kind of investigation to find out how exactly this is true..)<p>Support of Adsense Publishers
As all you know Google is big giant with billions of revenues on every quarter..but why they are not having some sort of 24X7 support for Adsense publishers who give them 30% of their revenue? Every quarter they are earning more than 2 billion in revenues from Adsense partner sites..But surprisingly they don't have a 24X7 support for  Adsense publishers even a bank which earns less than $10 million has a 24X7 customer support with a phone line but Google has none....<p>All we get from Adsense is 
	a) A crap support team who take years to reply
	b) Doesn't care about us even if we send multiple questions
	c) No proper forum
	d) No 24X7 support<p>What is preventing them to have a 24X7 customer call centre to support Adsense publishers? When they are afraid that having a customer call centre which would expose their unethical practices as they would be peppered  with endless questions from publishers regarding banning of their account?<p>Regarding my appeal:
Already I have filed a appeal for my adsense,saturday I got a mail stating that they are looking into it..but still I am yet to any kind of valid reply from them..2 days is enough for big organisation to reply  q query..It<p>shows how crappy is their support for Adsense publishers..I think Larry,Sergey and Eric are happy to do/follow/encourage these kind of un ethical practices as it brings them more revenue..<p>I think this is what they are doing inside the Adsense as a unit..I don't think they are not caring about publishers..Google should realise sooner or later that if they are going to care about publishers they are going to<p>dump them sooner or later for other publishers..They may think there can be no alternative to Adsense  but it all takes 5 or 10 years to build a credible atlernative..Back in 2006..Apple's networth for just $70 billion but now it's nearly 390 billion<p>To Dear Google ,
Don't be just over confident and ignore publishers like us..because we bring in more than 25% of your revenues each year and with Facebook breathing down Google, you may not get the same amount of revenue from your Google owned sites 5 years down the line..So it's time for you to change Google and be more responsive to publishers who give atleast 30% of their hard earned money to you..<p>It's time to have a strong support for publishers to give them genuine reasons about why they are taking down publishers account..It's good to warn them about invalid activity and wait for their response before banning them..<p>Whenever you are banning any publishers give them a detailed response instead of some vague reasons because that would make them to correct their mistakes",1318854757

A few other thoughts about OP:<p><i>Its easy to think that its too late, because look at those people who spent four years in college learning to code!</i><p>Don't look at anyone else. That's your problem. Just look at the problem at hand and your approach and solution. It's just you and your computer, mano-a-mano. Pretty primitive. That's when you stop worrying about the negatives and just go ahead and build something. And that's when you know nothing else really matters.<p><i>It is difficult!</i><p>Not really. Difficulty is relative. Start out by copying a ""Hello World"" program and getting it to run. Then add one new capability and get that to run. Then another. Then another. Always saving your last good version so that you can go back and start each step over, just in case you really fudge things up. Hey, you're programming! It wasn't that hard, was it?<p><i>I used to think I was cursed, because every time I tried to setup something new (new development environment, tool, library, etc), something would always go wrong.</i><p>There's a difference between systems administration (which all of this is) and programming. I hate the former (which I view as a necessary evil and takes 1% of my time) and love the latter (takes the other 99%).<p><i>Do you like it? ...do you feel a rush of excitement?</i><p>Yes! Nothing else I've ever done gives quite the same feeling as experiencing something I've built working for the first time ever. Happy dance!",1318853613

3120132,comment,3118888,3118888,21,0,acabal,,,"I've been reading about the imminent death of publishers for a while now, but I don't think they're ever going to disappear completely.  And I run a site for writers that processes hundreds of manuscripts daily.<p>People like to make the comparison of the inevitable democratization of books to how the internet changed the music industry, but that's just not an apt comparison.<p>Books cannot be consumed in the same way as music.  Pop songs are usually 2-3 minutes long, and an entire album clocks in at half an hour to an hour.  Generally you can listen to a few songs from a band and make a decision as to whether you like their style and want to buy the album on the spot.  Books aren't like that.  A reader must often invest a significant amount of time--days--before it becomes clear that a book is or isn't good.  Publishers provide the extremely valuable service of <i>validation</i>.  If you get your book published up by Random House, then the reader at the store can say, if absolutely nothing else, that a group of well-read professionals thought your book was good enough to warrant stamping with their brand and spending money polishing and marketing.  You just can't say that about 99% of self-published material, and when it can take days for a reader to determine quality, that distinction becomes important.<p>And, despite what many would lead you to believe, publishers provide a valuable service besides validation.  They take a raw manuscript and polish it up to professional standards.  The manuscript is only part of the finished product that we call a book.  You also need cover art, which is your book's first impression and incredibly important--not something you want to leave to your 18-year-old nephew with a cracked copy of Photoshop. You need typesetting, which is still important in the digital world: how many middle-aged writers know--or want to learn--HTML/CSS?  You need editing.  Having run a site for writers I can guarantee you that an author's perfect final manuscript is still filled with typos, mistakes, and ripe for polishing from a trained professional.  You need marketing: the best book in the world won't get read if nobody knows it exists.  The truth is that writers are good at writing, but often not that good at all of the other aspects of publishing a book.  A big publisher takes that off their hands and handles it in a professional way.<p>I suspect that the people who say publishers are dead have themselves never picked up a random indie author's book from Amazon.  If they had, they'd realize that not every author is Amanda Hocking or Scott Sigler.  In fact they'd probably realize that what they just read was filled with typos, had shitty cover art, maybe had greater structural problems like weak characterization, and likely was priced just about right at 99 cents.<p>If anything, the death of publishers could be very dangerous, because when young new readers start getting burned by crappy self-published books, they'll get turned off to reading and we'll have lost yet another generation to TV and fast media.",1318853596

3120130,comment,3119959,3120057,6,0,iqster,,,"Bump. In the past, I've been through Stanford's IOS dev course and ML course (via iTunes). Currently, I'm doing the AI course. It is truly amazing that Stanford is giving away this content for free.<p>As an academic, it makes me wondering how education will change over the next 10 years. If a prof gives a fantastic lecture in the Fall of 2010, does he need to repeat himself in 2011? I had the experience of lecturing an undergrad course in Programming Languages many years ago. Honestly, the content didn't change much (I was teaching Scheme, ML and Prolog). I did get a bit better answering and anticipating student questions. I'll admit that in some cases, content must be updated fairly frequently. For instance, Prof. Ousterhaut's web app course on the site seems to be covering Rails 2.x.x. Teaching it today, perhaps 3.x or 3.1 would be used.<p>However, when I look at how well the community can improve the quality of a lecture, it blows my mind. In the Stanford AI class, for instance, the lecturer made a slight error where he defined the admissibility criteria of the h function (estimated cost) in A* search as less than the true cost rather than less than or equal to the true cost. Well ... this was quickly spotted by students and a correction was promptly issued. This blows my mind!<p>This also has the potential of making things worse on the supply side of education. In the last decade, it has undoubtedly gotten harder to get a faculty position in Computer Science. Will the advent of online education make that situation worse? As someone who has been an educator in the past, my personal opinion is that education should be available for free. But, I worry that it might not be sustainable.",1318853474

3120123,comment,3119518,3119518,13,0,ppereira,,,"There is a lot of interesting research on wealth inequality in the US and around the world. For those interested in looking at data, I suggest the following as a starting point:<p>A historical database of top incomes in several countries: <a href=""http://184.168.89.58/sketch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://184.168.89.58/sketch/</a><p>A nice theoretical starting point on taxation and inequality: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0002374"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0002374</a>
Note that the term used to express trade in the first section of the paper could also be used to model progressive/negative tax rates.<p>Plots of the income going to the top 0.1% above a plot of the US top marginal tax rate (a proxy for the progressivity of the tax scheme):
<a href=""http://visualecon.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/percent_income_top_0_1.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visualecon.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads...</a><p>The top 5-10% of incomes tend to follow a pareto distribution which has a very fat tail. If the share owned by the top 0.01% increases, so will the share of the top 0.1% and the top 1%. Conversely, the share of the bottom 90% will decrease. In comparison to the 1970s, the take home pay of the bottom 90% is probably 30% lower just because of these distributional effects, while the relative income of the top 0.1% has increased 5 or 6 times. The next time you see an exorbitantly high CEO salary, it might be worth wondering how it affects you. Likely, many readers here are in the top 95-99% for whom the effect is somewhat neutral.<p>Some argue that inequality is good for growth, and that a rising tide raises all boats, etc. But the literature regarding the correlation between GINI coefficients and long-term growth is weak and not conclusive. When I looked at the data from the income database cited above, I could see little correlation for developed and undeveloped countries. I seem to remember reading an MIT thesis to the same effect.<p>Perfect redistribution and equality would obviously eliminate economic incentives for growth. Near-perfect inequality, might have the same result. The very small fraction of the population in which wealth has condensed would be economically motivated, but the rest of the population that is living on the welfare state (e.g. welfare, minimum wage + EITC) would have a reduced incentive to earn more. A detailed analysis of the EITC is interesting, but peripheral to my point.<p>Furthermore, when inequality varies like a power law, it is easy to see that a rising tide with reduced Pareto coefficient (increased inequality) could lead to a worse outcome for the majority.<p>The obvious way to address inequality is through progressive or redistributive taxation. The theoretical paper linked above shows how increasing progressivity reduces inequality, but this result is also intuitive. With a 100% redistributive tax, one would have perfect equality.<p>Increasing income tax progressivity alters financial incentives and creates incentives for small business and corporations that target the (more affluent) majority. By contrast, flat or regressive taxes alter the economics to favour larger customers. There is a related but much more complex story for international taxation. When corporations accumulate their income in corporate tax havens and then repatriate that income during a ""tax holiday"", the result is a highly regressive tax system.<p>Many argue about addressing inequality through ""job creation"" and ""big government projects"". I don't have a story related to this, but the Canadian data I have looked at makes me a little suspicious. I guess when you inject funds at a single point in the economy (e.g. corporation) and then allow it to trickle down to employees, portions of those funds would be funnelled off at every level of the corporation and the net result may be an increase in inequality. However, if that corporation is performing a valuable social service to the public, then that may mitigate the inequality.<p>I guess my main point is that the story of income inequality is a complex one that is closely related to taxation. As such, it is a policy choice of the government and the people who elect them. If the ""99%"" feel that they are not satisfied with the deal that has been struck, then they can voice their opinion in the hope that the government will alter that deal.",1318853219

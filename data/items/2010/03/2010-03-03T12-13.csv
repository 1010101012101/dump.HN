1163957,comment,1163625,1163866,0,0,toothcomb,,,"I think the article is fascinating.<p>It shows you how big operations can go wrong, if safeguards are not put in place. The numbers here are mind numbing, this is collossal murder.<p>There has been a series of programmes on industrial modern farming on the bbc recently in the UK.  Which focussed on the best parts of technological innovation in farming.  Whereas this article exposes all that's wrong with factory farming.<p>As an Englishman I find it hard to comprehend the scale of things in the states. It horrifies me.  The London circular felt huge to me, until I witnessed a freeway. Now it appears small and the cars look like toys.<p>We had the BSE outbreak in the UK, which has led to a change in consumer opinion. BSE was reportedly a result of canibalism.  Recyling your outputs to inputs is a nice idea, but it's risky practice.<p>There's no mention of the quality of life these pigs are living.  My uncle used to run a small factory pig farm in the UK and that was horrendous enough.  That put me off of pork. Later working at an egg farm ensured that, I no longer ate eggs or chicken.  There is something incredibly powerful about seeing things first hand.  Animals deserve a better life than that, they surely deserve to see daylight.<p>The computer industry, has it's own issues with energy usage and pollution.  The silicon valleys are known for poisoning rivers.  There are parallels here.  Consumeres need to be aware, to put pressure on industry.  We can be ethical consumers, we can vote with our wallets.  We can speak out, against injustices and barbaric practices.<p>Hacker news is full of talk about start ups and web entrapaneurs.  Money is not the be all and end all.  There is a social and environmental dimension to every business.<p>If the article does not shock you, or fill you with bile, then alas I feel there is something inherently wrong with you.<p>I do not delight in discovering injustices, whether it's Ethiopian farmers getting ripped off for the price of coffee or animals suffering.  And I have a compulsion to put these injustices right, if I can. Though sometimes our impulses can blind our moral judgement.<p>I read a book that was published over a decade ago, that reported that every one of North America's great lakes had been overly polluted.  A lot of the world's seas have been overfished, there are many dead zones, look on Google Earth.<p>You'd hope that with the advancement of science and the freedom of knowledge we could become a better race of people.  This really saddens me. I believe the hacker spirit, is one that aims for solutions (possibly perfection), and I hope that that same spirit is well concidered and respectful.",1267620725
1163956,comment,1163841,1163937,0,0,lpolovets,,,"Let's say you plan to keep 2 bytes/16 bits of metadata for each string in the corpus. You can use these 16 bits to store five 3-bit counters for the number of characters in a string whose ascii values are 0, 1, ... 4 mod 5. Each counter can go up to 7 (0x111), at which point further increments are no-ops (so a string with 7 characters that have an ascii value of 0 mod 5 will have the same value in the first counter as a string with 20 characters that have an ascii value of 0 mod 5).<p>When you want to see if the Levenshtein distance between two strings is less than some threshold (say 2), you first compare the two sets of 5 counters. The difference in values for corresponding counters can help you determine a lower bound on the Levenshtein distance. For example, if the first string has six characters that are 1 mod 5, and the second string has 2 characters that are 1 mod 5, then your edit distance will be at least 2, so if you were only looking for strings that are within a distance of 1, you no longer need to bother computing Levenshtein for your two strings. Comparing counters is just a few bit operations, so it's super fast.",1267620713

1163946,comment,1163625,1163753,0,0,bmj,,,"I'm not sure it's possible for factory farms to change, especially when raising animals.  If you talk to someone who raises animals in a sustainable way (if you don't personally know a farmer, read Joel Salatin), they will tell you there is absolutely an upper limit to what can be produced sustainably.    I purchase all of the meat my family eats from a local farmer (who only sells directly to consumers) and he said while he could easily double the number of customers, he wouldn't be able to maintain the same practices (this includes everything to what the animals eat--grass only in the case of ruminants--to where the animals actually lived--all are pastured in the style popularized by Salatin).<p>I could be old-fashioned and myopic, though.  Maybe someone can figure out a way to have the best of both worlds.<p>Regarding cost, I no longer worry about the amount of money my family spends on groceries.  Yes, we spend $5/pound for beef, and $2.50/pound for chicken, but this is stuff we are putting in our bodies--it's what keeps us alive.  I feel that price shouldn't be the driving factor in what we eat.",1267620115

Because most of it <i>is</i> bribery, of an indirect sort.<p>In this industry, people are allowed to fly journalists to exotic locations, throw them massively expensive parties, comp them entry to conferences, entertain them, take them out to fabulous restaurants, give them enormous amounts of their valuable time, allow them sneak previews, team t-shirts and other tchotchkes, etc. etc. etc. And that's the stuff that's <i>on</i> the books.<p>If you look at it as a simple ROI calculation, bribing a journalist seems like a good deal, and not tremendously different from all the other stuff you would have had to do anyway.<p>I'm not sure that it's simple ethics that makes us all recoil from bribery. Because we're obviously okay with all the other indirect, soft bribery.<p>I think, at a deeper level, people realize that once journalists offer direct quid pro quos, then there will be no end to their demands.

(Moving up the value chain means you offer more complicated and valuable services of the level of the people who were previously buying your services.  For example, right now you're doing something fairly unsophisticated -- making ""websites"" -- on the behalf of affiliates who are not very sophisticated.  One step up the value chain is making websites for yourself and being an affiliate.  Another possible step after that is selling whatever the affiliate is marketing, for yourself.  It is not unusual on the Internet to have chains which go half a dozen or a dozen stages deep, and your competitive position gets better for each stage you climb out of.)<p>The kind of people who buy websites for less than $1,000 are disproportionately going to be very, very difficult clients for you to work with.  If you're capable of operating a website in a commercial or semi-commercial niche, just go ahead and <i>do</i> that -- you'll make far more money and won't have to spend time grinding out more websites to flip every month.<p>This requires transitioning your focus from ""I make websites!"" to ""I have a business which happens to be based on the Internet.""  That has been a rather jarring transition for a lot of newer SEOs and software developers I've known in my day.  Best of luck with it.<p>Incidentally, just because you are from Eastern Europe does not mean you need to charge your customers cheap prices.  Charge based on the value you provide them.  You are able to live on probably a third of what I can, but if you and I are able to do the same thing for some American customer (who is an ocean away from either of us), then we're able to charge the same amount of money.

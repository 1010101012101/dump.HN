The better questions are:<p><pre><code>    1. What do these equations represent?\n    2. Why do we care about what they represent?\n    3. What does &quot;solving them&quot; mean for the things they represent?\n</code></pre>\nSo, maybe a more important muscle to exercise is the one that lets us go up and down the ladder of abstraction.  A huge part of mathematics is seeing a class of (relatively) concrete things, finding commonalities and drawing out abstractions, reasoning about the abstractions, and then drawing conclusions about the more concrete things.<p>You can do so much of this without the formalisms of classroom mathematics and, honestly, it&#x27;s what &quot;real&quot; mathematicians do.  The formalisms are just a high-bandwidth way of communicating these ideas between mathematicians.  They&#x27;re just a highly technical map of the terrain, not the terrain itself.<p>In fact, if I was teaching someone and they invented their own bizarro syntax for &quot;solving&quot; equations I&#x27;d be ecstatic.  Whatever it was that happened in their head that made them<p>> but the effort to get there will be a power of that needed by a &quot;math-inclined&quot; person.<p>This is fine and true, perhaps, but if so it&#x27;s true of all things, not just mathematics.

That&#x27;s just a heinous law. What&#x27;s the next step? Repossessing kidneys for small unpaid medical bills?<p>Many countries have land taxes which work reasonably well. There can be some proscribed formula (based on a regression on nearby property). Or they can do valuations. There&#x27;ll always be problems, but it&#x27;s not more evil than many other taxes (unless they enforce it by stealing property).<p>Maybe the government will send in SWAT teams to collect unpaid land tax bills from poor people, and a friendly note to rich people; but that&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s a land tax. How do you think they treat unpaid parking tickets?<p>The advantage of taxing the use or consumption of a scare resource (land) instead of income should be obvious. If Bill Gates wants a mansion, he&#x27;s making it harder for normal people to buy a home. If Bill Gates makes a billion dollars selling some operation system, he&#x27;s presumably creating jobs, and making a lot of people happy (since they can get on the internet without buying an expensive Mac, or having to figure out how to configure their modem using Linux). (Note - some rich people make their money by being parasites, but capitalism works because this usually isn&#x27;t the case).<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the stabilising effect that a land tax has. Property is a huge investment, driven by unsophisticated retail investors (who may be putting most of their life&#x27;s savings into a single home), prone to stupid fluctuations, which can destroy the lives of normal people when it does something funny. Taxing it helps keep it a little rational (as the taxes will encourage people to avoid it when it starts heating up).",1378683737

Foreclosure means the lien holder takes title to the property, and the current owner, the one who owes the debt that the lien holder was unable to collect, loses title. Then the lien holder, who now has title to the property, sells it for whatever the market will bear, and pockets the sale price minus whatever costs he has to pay. That effectively means the lien holder gets whatever equity is in the property once he has foreclosed on it and sold it.<p><i>This article talks about DC tax lien sales, and doesn&#x27;t mention keeping equity</i><p>Well, of course not, since it only talks about buying the tax lien and foreclosing on it; it doesn&#x27;t talk about the part where once you&#x27;ve foreclosed, you sell the property and pocket the money.<p>The article does describe the foreclosure process the same way I did above:<p>&quot;The District of Columbia statutes require that you file a judicial foreclosure on your lien.  This means that your attorney will run title, notice all the parties on title and file a foreclosure action in the court to get a judge to issue a final judgment.  Once the judge rules in your favor, you can go to the DC Office of Tax and Revenue, pay any outstanding taxes and bills that may be due, and get issued the tax deed.&quot;<p>So you buy the tax lien, and if the tax isn&#x27;t paid, you foreclose, you pay off the outstanding taxes and bills, and you get the property.

The set of laws that allow this insanity are almost certainly the result of lobbying efforts by tax lien buyers.  Lobbying rules at the local and state level range from non-existent to very lax.  As a result, getting a law or ordinance passed to benefit your company or industry at the local level is a relatively inexpensive and simple affair.  People need to monitor laws and ordinances in their local jurisdictions, and speak up when they see things that don&#x27;t pass the smell test.  Otherwise, we&#x27;ll continue to drown in this type of stuff.",1378683177

(Invariably, someone likes to point out that it offends everyone, and conclude therefore that it can&#x27;t be misogynistic)<p>2) Yes, people differ in their tolerances for crudeness in their humor. First, I think most people can agree that none of this was actually even funny -- as in, these presentations did not successfully execute the elements of humor. Second, a hackathon is not the place to get up on stage and pretend to come on the audience. There&#x27;s audacity -- which, when coupled with other necessary elements can make for a great presentation -- and there&#x27;s poor taste.<p>3) Yes, some women will take particular offense to these presentations and they are justified.<p>Allowing a couple of dumbasses to get up and laugh about staring at breasts and dropping terrible puns -- even when their presentation is self-deprecating and they hint that they know how crass they are being -- sends the message that the organizers and the audience accept the premise of the presentation: that leering at women&#x27;s bodies in a completely unaware manner, is acceptable. It&#x27;s not -- please let there be nobody who contests that point.<p>(Aside: a woman in a low-cut shirt is not putting her breasts on display for public consumption. And leering is different than looking -- nobody is saying that you aren&#x27;t allowed to notice the attractiveness of a woman.)<p>Getting up and pretending to inseminate the audience is just gross, and as an act, it is at the same level as the guy in my seventh grade class who drew a full-page phallus in my yearbook. His excuse is that he was thirteen, and assumed that everyone else was as obsessed with his genitals as he was. That people are laughing about this sends another message, and I can understand if women are more sensitive to that message than men -- who were themselves thirteen y/o males at one time.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve demonstrated why things like this create an environment where it&#x27;s hard to say, seriously, that women should get into tech.",1378683123

I am someone who comes from a background of hardware that had to learn software, but then when Verilog came along, oh man, was I in heaven. Do not think of VHDL or Verilog as a language, think of it more in terms of HTML, HTML is a mark up language for type setting, HDL is a mark up language for hardware. Hardware is not sequential, everything will happen at the same time unless you prevent that with a state machine. With sequential languages like C or Pascal etc., everything happens sequentially unless you go out of you want to try to make things happen seemingly at once. With HDL, you have the opposite problem, everything will happen at once on each clock cycle, unless you make a state maching to make things sequential.

Cancer is a medical condition. ADHD is not. Psychologists are not doctors and cannot treat medial conditions -- they are neither trained or licensed to do that.<p>Psychiatrists are psychologists with an M.D. degree. When you call a psychiatrist &quot;doctor&quot; , you are acknowledging his medical training, not his psychological training. There is no mental doctor, and there is no mental specialty in medicine.<p>The reason? Modern medicine is evidence based, and psychological treatments are not evidence-based.<p>> Psychological malpractice cases aren&#x27;t that rare.<p>They are very rare. Public records show that, when something goes wrong in psychological treatment of children, the parents are more likely to face charges than the psychologist or psychiatrist, and I already gave one well-known example of a psychiatrist still practicing after being involved in a case that led to murder charges against the parents, who administered the drugs the psychiatrist prescribed.<p>> Psychiatrists are no different.<p>The public record shows that this is false. There are cases, but they represent a small fraction of those in medical fields, and the behaviors tend to be more egregious -- sexual abuse, damage to the patient through outright incompetence or prescribing the wrong drug. There are fewer cases such as one sees in medical specialties that have established procedures based on long clinical experience -- and scientific evidence to support clinical practice.<p>> Psychiatry isn&#x27;t clinical psychology, it is medicine<p>A psychiatrist is a psychologist with an M.D. degree. The M.D. degree is acquired before the person begins psychiatric training, for a number of reasons including the fact that psychiatry is not a medical field in the modern sense of the word -- fields based on science, and on evidence.<p>The only reason psychiatry exists is to confer an unearned status on psychologists and psychology. And recent changes will make this obvious even to those who have been avoiding reality. One of those changes is the NIMH&#x27;s recent decision to abandon the DSM, psychiatry&#x27;s &quot;Bible&quot; and primary diagnostic guide. The reason? It&#x27;s not reliable enough to be useful in research. About this decision, NIMH director Thomas Insel said &quot;While DSM has been described as a Bible for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been reliability  each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity.</i>&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>Now - imagine someone in authority deciding to throw out an influential oncology textbook on the ground that it&#x27;s not valid. Imagine the uproar. But in this case, it caused some comment but no great surprise -- most people in the field saw this coming. The reason for that muted reaction is that psychiatry isn&#x27;t evidence-based and <i>it is not medicine</i>, all public claims to the contrary.<p>> Making up your own non-standard definitions of terms to justify your completely inaccurate rants isn&#x27;t helpful.<p>Shall I give you Insel&#x27;s email address so you can complain to the source of my views about how inaccurate he is?",1378682479

I think there are two big use cases.<p>The first would be learning/demo purposes where the data you store should essentially be ephemeral (imagine training sessions, interactive online tutorials, etc). In these cases it&#x27;s more about experimenting with the query language and data model than anything else. RethinkDB has used Docker for this purpose to great success.<p>The other would involve mounting an external volume in order to persist the data and would allow you to isolate and limit the process which would otherwise monopolize the available resources of system (usually memory in MongoDB&#x27;s case).",1378681686

You could argue that a literally tone-deaf person isn&#x27;t, but not that !musical_inclination == tone_deafness; so how would you define it? The simplest definition that would catch the most cases here would just be the <i>lack of interest</i>.

The finger-prick is a distraction; phlebotomy is not a huge deal.<p>Instead, the important things are the turn-around-time and billed cost. If Theranos can offer 4 hour turnaround and a clinic/hospital cannot (or even get close), they will pay for it because it is good for doctor productivity and patient outcomes. If Theranos can maintain a half-medicare cost structure, that&#x27;s also good for the provider because they can expand their margins.<p>Additionally, Theranos might do deals with insurance companies such that they reduce their reimbursements/push providers to use Theranos, which reduces the insurer&#x27;s costs. The outcomes-case is even more pressing for an insurer these days.<p>Now, none of these directly translate to lower insurance premiums, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t economic reasons to adopt the service.<p>> From the outside, it seems like the entire healthcare industry is built on being purposefully inefficient so as to create large costs that they can in turn mark up.<p>This is generally untrue, as much as it is a public perception.

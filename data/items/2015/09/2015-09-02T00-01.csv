These things are as old as the hills. A certain amount of genetic turnover is, as you point out, just the fitness function making its judgements.<p>The trouble we have is the <i>rate</i> of extinction and invasion. A typical ecology can support a certain rate of species loss... A single species will be replaced by other organisms that can occupy the same niche. They will fill in the gaps and the same level of biodiversity can be maintained.<p>However these things take time. And if, while the replacement species is adapting to fit the old niche, another several extinctions happens, we start to have problems. Organisms that could&#x27;ve adapted to fill out the niche are themselves under stress. Once you have several key species under stress simultaneously, you run the risk that an entire segment of the food chain... possibly double digit percentages of the metabolic chain, will collapse simultaneously.<p>With a slow enough rate of extinction, you can just keep filling in the holes, but once you cross a certain threshold, you can trigger a regression to a more primordial state. Like desert. You end up with orders of magnitude less complex of an ecology.<p>If think we can get by on a planet with an ecology that is an order of magnitude less complex, with an order of magnitude (or two) fewer species, then none of what I&#x27;m saying is a problem for you.<p>I am scared of dramatically decreasing the number of species just because it seems really hard to predict the effects of that. So I&#x27;d like to delete the species as slowly as possible to mitigate our risk.",1441155300

When you come down to it, there isn&#x27;t much difference among Zen (Chan), Vipassana, Insight, Taoist shengong meditations, etc. This is because they all touch on the same ground of being (emptiness). (And yes, you&#x27;ll find this in Western traditions and indigenous tribal traditions).<p>The exercises that will have the most variants are concentration exercises, usually some sort of one-point concentration on a sensory object -- sight, sound, touch, kinesthetics, taste, smell, etc., tangible or untangible in varying forms of abstractions. Journeying methods (where you visualize a space, or say, in Gestalt therapy where you allow fragments of your persona to embody) are variations on concentration techniques. Despite the emotional connotation of the word &#x27;concentration&#x27; (which usually mean, some sort of pressure, stress, or force), skill in concentration has more to do with relaxing than stressing.<p>Kundalini yoga is interesting because you&#x27;d have to distinguish between Kundalini Yoga (tm) (the specific lineage of Kundalini yoga promoted by a genius in marketing) and kundalini yoga (the class of practices or yoga designed to awaken shakti and kickstart the Kundalini process). I don&#x27;t know the details of your practice, but I wouldn&#x27;t doubt that you would find them helpful. If you are arousing energy, then you will start surfacing up buried emotions, memories, habits, etc. and a complete system will also include methods on dealing with it. If nothing else, there is simply &quot;sitting through it&quot;, and that is where it intersects the mindfulness practices like vipassana or insight.<p>Does this help?",1441154272

Samuel Gompers, maybe the most conservative labor leader of his time, said &quot;You cannot weigh the human soul on the same scales as piece of pork.&quot; And working people, along with the management class for the most part, understood this to be an undeniable truth. In fact, this piece of common sense was enshrined into US law with the Clayton Act of 1914, which stated &quot;The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.&quot; But in the last 20 years, as capital has gained the firm upper hand, the common sense understanding has shifted towards the idea that labor is in fact a commodity.<p>The ideas behind the so-called &quot;on-demand workforce&quot; further solidify the notion that labor is a commodity. After all, you can order an uber ride just as easily as you can order vitamins online.<p>It&#x27;s so pervasive that even I, someone born into a union family and a firm believer in the idea of worker solidarity, have to force myself to believe that labor is not a commodity. Why? The business class treated labor as expendable in 1915, just as they do in 2015. Why did working people understand this truth in 1915 but not today? I don&#x27;t know.<p>I read a recently released sociology book earlier this year (going crazy looking for the title/author, can&#x27;t find it), that posits millennials are far more likely than any recent generation to blame themselves for the problems they face. It&#x27;s part of the reason that the self-help industry is bigger business than it&#x27;s ever been. It&#x27;s not always your fault. Our modern economy is built on rotten ideas like labor = commodity. If we want to do something about inequality, it&#x27;s time that we subject fundamentally unjust ideas like these to a serious critique.</i><p>[1] Thank you maceo: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9502757"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9502757</a>",1441152749

Rather, if you are practicing meditation correctly and stripping away self-deceptions, then you will eventually start surfacing up the things that lead to avoiding things that are important or urgent.<p>And it can go the other way too: people who are busy doing stuff may well also be procrastinating the really big, important issues in their life. Doing things that are urgent but not important becomes another procrastination tool, and helps with the self-deception that &quot;you are doing something about it&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also been my experience that trying to face procrastination face on, takes on the quality of the emotions involved.<p>For example, if you were to attempt to rest your awareness on anxiety, the way you would go about it will be skittish, and avoid it. If you were to attempt to rest your awareness on anger, you will start to get aggressive towards your anger.

This makes your intuition non-transferrable to other semantics (lacking a clear CS example off the top of my head, I&#x27;ll just throw out the usual trick of asking: does this work the same on a GPU? I&#x27;m confident there&#x27;s a Yoneda analogue there).<p>Studying CT is completely extra-curricular as far as I&#x27;m concerned and I could never recommend it as a way to implement or use CPS, but <i>understanding</i>, for certain rather aggressive values of &quot;understand&quot; I feel comes from nearly no other pathway. It&#x27;s entirely too beautiful and <i>simple</i> (for certain mathematical values of &quot;simple&quot;) to escape.<p>Also the commutative diagrams are pretty much exactly the same as the chemistry ones you&#x27;re talking about.

The point of this case is that Uber controlled their workers to the point where their relationship with the company should be considered an employer / employee relationship, and thus the workers are entitled to benefits they did not receive.

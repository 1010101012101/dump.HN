What you have is basically a cross disciplinary collaboration where you just don&#x27;t have the educational background nor the expertise to do the engineering yourself.<p>The resentment your describing is really the same resentment you can feel towards your boss -&quot;All he does is tell us what to do. He&#x27;s not in the trenches like us!&quot; - and it&#x27;s directly related to the amount of mutual respect. In essence, how hard do you feel the other person is working relative to you.<p>Your description of your coworkers seems to indicate that you didn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re pulling their weight, and that&#x27;s definitely a big problem.<p>I&#x27;ve heard second hand that in the valley there are a <i>lot</i> of incompetent PhDs that use their educational background as leverage to slack off. People will often hire graduates solely based on a degree thinking that if someone has a Math PhD &quot;they&#x27;re smart, they can learn on the job, and they&#x27;ll contribute in some magical way just by being there&quot;. But actually these guys have just spent 5 years in poverty getting an advanced degree and don&#x27;t want to be a code monkeys with a bunch of fresh out of college 21 year-olds. And, oh yeah - reality check, no one cares about their degree in abstract algebra.<p>9/10 of these PhDs are crappy engineers and 9/10 times they are thrown at problems they don&#x27;t really have a background in (so they can&#x27;t even be crappy and regurgitate equations they&#x27;re memorized).",1391475534

(The old trace caches of the P4 chips are different than the u-op caches of the new architectures, since the trace cache actually encoded branch predictions into the actual cache line lookup, which was always pretty wild.)",1391475453

You&#x27;ll take ownership of our crawl & data pipeline, keeping them running with high uptime, scaling them up to handle load, and adding new data sources and new features to help our customers make even better decisions. Experience with distributed systems and/or big data is a huge bonus - we&#x27;re looking for people that have a good intuition about what good architecture looks like, and who can grow into leadership roles.<p>Our current tech stack is mostly Python, Linux, AWS (EC2, S3, & EMR mostly), MongoDB, Celery and Redis.

We practice peer code review and continuous deployment on all our code and systems.<p>Our entire team works remotely. We&#x27;re very flexible about where and when you work, as long as you ship code, keep systems online, and are reachable by other team members for part of the day. We stay in touch via a team chatroom and weekly team video chats, with impromptu 1-on-1 video chats whenever there&#x27;s a detailed issue to discuss. To make this work, you&#x27;ll need to be in a compatible timezone (between PDT(UTC-08) and CET(UTC+1)), and be very fluent writing and speaking English. Like getting out of the house to work? Ask about our mobile Internet subsidy:)<p>This is a full time, longterm opportunity.

But instructions which would be affected by RAW hazards will slow down execution if those instructions are on the critical path.  So paying close attention to instruction-level dependencies <i>will</i> produce better results in both since you can increase the ILP possible in the instruction sequence.

The point is that copyright was intended to promote the progress of science/arts/knowledge and there are a lot of things right now that don&#x27;t fall into fair use and hinders progress.<p>Here are some other examples. Many years ago when the Internet was first going mainstream, fan websites of TVs and movies were getting cease and desist letters because they had pictures of the actors in their roles on their websites. Technically this is still a violation, but most companies now at least have the sense to turn a blind eye. You&#x27;ll see even on Wikipedia, there are a lot of reservations of posting a screenshot of a tv show, movie, or video game because of this.<p>Another random example is fan fiction. This seems like it would be a good candidate for rules to relax over time. At first, fan fiction may more restricted because the original authors may in fact want to write their own sequels. But over the course of time the work enters the public stream of consciousness and progress via things like fan fiction should be allowed instead of hunted down and destroyed.<p>Another example comes from an actual case law I can&#x27;t remember the details from, but a book essentially about &#x27;The most important things you should know when dating a Trekkie&#x27;. It made references to episodes in Star Trek so they got sued. Because it didn&#x27;t directly parody Star Trek, it didn&#x27;t fall under fair use. If I recall, the book lost the case. Again, since Star Trek has been deeply absorbed into the culture, it makes sense that copyright protection needs to weaken over time to allow more ideas/expression instead of hinder them. (A related topic might be the subtle distinction between parody and satire which is also currently a problem in current copyright law.)",1391473570

We set up an arbitrary restriction saying people can&#x27;t reproduce it, and that is the only reason this artificially created business exists.

It is more broken than it is working, it is a giant mess.<p>I&#x27;m glad your time-machine is working and you&#x27;ve experienced the 2015 ecosystem.<p>>You&#x27;re strangely contradicting yourself. First you acknowledge that tab casting is a thing,then you pretend that tab casting isn&#x27;t something it does and use that as justification for Miracast&#x27;s superiority? Very confusing.<p>I&#x27;m not pretending tab casting isn&#x27;t a thing. What I mean by &quot;sink&quot; is a device that receives the stream. Chromecast can do this because it controls both ends, the software you install on Chrome and the Chromecast device (the sink). Your surface area for testing and coverage is much smaller, vs a standard that is in hundreds of devices. Even then the feature is still not on mobile devices officially and is experimental.<p>>PS - Chromecast works with other devices. It isn&#x27;t just desktops. People already made apps that could send a full Android &quot;desktop&quot; to the Chromecast back in the early days before Google killed it with an update. I&#x27;m sure it will return with the release of this SDK.<p>Yes, I&#x27;ve used Koush&#x27;s Allcast app and it is nice. I&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t happen (Android to Chromecast) - it will. But still you aren&#x27;t getting what I&#x27;m saying here - there is only one target device you have to build for (Chromecast) not hundreds of TVs, BluRay players, and dongles.<p>>It is an identical surface area between the two.<p>I mean test and interop surface area. It is surely not identical. Your test matrix for Chromecast is n. For Miracast it is n^2. That is the real problem. Not your straw man about &quot;DRM&quot;",1391473496

That&#x27;s the nature of javascript.<p>As for the question is there too many frameworks, I disagree. devs will mostly use frameworks that are well documented and maintained. If the last commit in your project was 2 years ago, if you dont have an issue tracker set up or you dont fix bugs, if there is no test other devs aint gona use your library that&#x27;s a fact.<p>But again , open source projects are basically free work,so let&#x27;s not complain.

It&#x27;s a big deal.<p>As far as agriculture, crops have evolved to certain soil types and climactic conditions.  For examples, yield rates are going down for grains like wheat due to warmer nights, and the soil in Iowa in 2012 was too hot for seeding corn!

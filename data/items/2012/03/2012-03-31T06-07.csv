3779630,comment,3778999,3778999,2,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"Linux distributions (and GNU, and BSDs) don't have to ""win"" the desktop. They already have, with one important qualification: you have to care.<p>Mind you, if you are looking for one-size-fits-all, Windows fits the bill perfectly. All the choices have been made. But if you value customization, Linux and BSDs are your only choices.<p>(I mean, for Pete's sake, you can boot a room full of machines from a KNOPPIX terminal server, running out of a virtual machine, and then migrate that running VM to a system you just booted FROM it... And shut down the original! We're not in Kansas anymore!)<p>Linux is certainly less appealing as a dogfood, despite concerted efforts, in part because people can't take the brands they paid money for, along with them. That's why ""free is not cheap enough"" for many people and efforts to make Linux ""sexy"" can only go so far without this.<p>Commercial games are the epitomy of this and Linux doesn't get big commercial games. (Maybe that's because Linux users are mostly zealots who haven't bought a game in over a decade, because they are against DRM, etc... But that's a tangent.)<p>I'm not sure winning the dogfood market is even a worthwhile goal.<p>There is actually a LOT of duplication of effort happening right now with so many distributions trying make the Linux desktop ""sexier,"" simpler, and more like Windows. Maybe it's just me, but that feels like the wrong solution. When I need Windows for ""legacy"" reasons (to run that proprietary accounting software, because that's what my accountant accepts), I just fire up KVM or Wine.<p>I don't think the Linux (BSD, etc) camp needs to take competing with Windows so seriously. They've already won. There is simply nothing better, if you care about code. You don't have to know everything, but you have to -- ehem -- RTFM. Non-coders simply aren't the primary audience. I know there are some who would disagree.<p>If you run a shop that doesn't allow the user the option of installing Windows software, or can standardize on document formats, Linux distributions (etc) are an easy choice today. That's how dogfood works. People eat what's in front of them.<p>Trying to sell Linux on the desktop without also being a fascist in this way, will only cause people to compare things to Windows. It's a recipe for complaints, in which case you might as well just feed them what they're really asking for.<p>That said, I agree with the author's point about rolling upgrades. If, for example, I'm working within a single package management framework (like APT or RPM, etc) exclusively, I should be able to upgrade, down-grade, side-grade, and any other grade imaginable. Reinstalls could and should be rare.<p>Ubuntu is 70 to 80% Debian packages, so why can't I ""upgrade"" (or downgrade) from Debian to Ubuntu, or from Mint to Debian (or any other package system to any other)?<p>I very much wish distribution projects 1) held onto a stronger sense of individuality while also 2) cooperating more to allow this level of interoperability. Simultaneous specialization and integration are not mutually exclusive: it's what modular software design is all about.",1333176691

Much slower is figuring out what a whole thought is saying, figuring out how it fits into the fabric of the text, figuring out whether it’s right, what it says about the author’s agenda, what news ideas it provokes, etc.<p>There’s certainly some marginal advantage to come from improving word parsing speed, but just like any speed reading technique, that advantage goes only so far, I would guess. (For instance, if I’m only trying to recognize words & nominally parse the grammar, I can move my eyes much faster and cover text extremely quickly, but when I’m doing that, I’ll typically realize at the end of a paragraph or page that I don’t fully understand what’s being said because I haven’t taken the time to think through all the implications.)",1333175421

We can't change that, but we can save you lots of time by making sure that's the lowest price. Of course, we do save a lot of people money on short trips, but the longer the better.<p>2. Yes, absolutely. Just describe your requirements in the comments section and make sure you work with the experts to keep them on the right track. This is really where we can save the most for you.<p>3. No, not at all. This is a global service. It works best when you're flying to lesser know places because our experts may have local knowledge that helps get better prices than you know.<p>4. Only a very small percentage of winning flights use loopholes. But yes, they can and do disappear. Luckily, because we're ""human-powered"" and because these loopholes are discovered by humans, it's more likely you'll get access to loophole savings on Flightfox.<p>5. Yes, maybe, probably, not sure :)<p>6. We need to reach critical mass to really leverage the power of frequent flyer points. We'll get there soon :)<p>7. At this stage, it's all human powered. We're only a few weeks old, so we hope to evolve. Some of our experts claim to use custom software. There are definitely lots of manual tricks and tips too.<p>All the best and thanks for the kind words.",1333174911

It's possible that there's been some glitch with Murmur -- maybe a server crash that was improperly recovered and ended up corrupting some files.

But Perl 6 is designed such that without many of those failures we couldn't have figured it out earlier what it would take to build Perl 6. Perl 6 has a mutable grammar, which means it should be written in itself. And this created a huge problem, because you don't have ready tools in hand to build such a thing. Many of them had to be built from scratch. And people failed many times exploring strategies doing that. Some people got ill, some people lost jobs, and projects like this which span a lot of time and require volunteer effort without much funding takes toll on people.<p>In many ways there was a lead, Lisp is so extensible because its written in itself. We really should have understood this from history. But achieving that in a non homoiconic language was difficult and required thinking in direction totally new to C based languages.<p>But great things have come out of it. Audrey's Pugs taught us so many things. And as she says, the 'Perl 6 on CPAN' thing started long back. Moose has become a very awesome tool for OO programming. Other things borrowed from Perl 6, things like given/when have shown a way to Perl 5 for evolution. Devel::Declare showed a new way to do syntax experiments outside core without using source filters. And many great things have come out of it. Its difficult to imagine how Perl 5 will likely evolve over time.<p>A few years back none of us could have seen Devel::Declare or even Moose coming. I can only imagine how Perl 5 is going to evolve over time.<p>Lastly I would say Rome was not built in a day. Perl 6 will take time, but it will come out in some years to come.",1333173881

The funny thing though, is that she was saying the other day she feels so much more able to fight it now that she's off chemo and not feeling sick all the time. She's feeling like a million bucks, I hope it stays that way...\nThe other instance is myself; I am currently recovering from my second go with postpartum depression. I am ok now, I actually feel like dynamite too :) but I did have to go on meds for it. It's unreal how it affects you physically.

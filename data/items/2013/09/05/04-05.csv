Measure the slope of a curve, measure the area under a curve. No big whoop. Sure, the details get fiddly but 90% of  anxiety over calculus comes from its arbitrary place as the capstone of a suffocatingly rigid elementary math sequence, not its inherent difficulty or magisterial importance.<p>Stats and discrete math are harder imho, and people teach themselves those all the time.

Most of the scenarios I&#x27;ve had where the precise same timestamp was at all likely, the updates would also have been identical. If you want to have overlapping cells resolving highly concurrent writes (not even using wide rows to make precisely concurrent writes go to different cells anyway), Cassandra is probably not the right tool to you.<p>Of course, if that were considered a likely scenario (generally microsecond collisions at the row level would only be at high probability if you had high concurrency on a record), you have a number of paths open for resolving it, the  one that I&#x27;ve usually ended up with is that the two concurrent updates actually should be to two different records ANYWAY (usually you add a client ID to the key, for example) because you want to have a record of them which is later resolved when any partitioning issues are addressed (so, you write with ANY consistency to a log, have sloppy real-time reads that are consistency ONE, but then have another process which does ALL consistency reads on the log and then resolves any conflicts using application logic, before writing with QUORUM consistency to the &quot;source of truth&quot;.<p>Alternatively, you can simply provide a client generated timestamp which has a different scale/resolution with a lower order bits being truly random values. For example, if you have that kind of high-concurrency, you probably don&#x27;t need to handle a range of timestamps beyond ~50 days. You can then use a client generated timestamp which is a combination of 32 high order bits for milliseconds since the epoch and then a random 32-bit value for the low order bits, which makes the odds of a collision on the timestamp pretty good even for highly concurrent cases.<p>I&#x27;m curious about the use case where you&#x27;d have all the concurrency with different but overlapping values, but you&#x27;d not want to record them separately and then have some custom app logic for resolving them.",1378353607

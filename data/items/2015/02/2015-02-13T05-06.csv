9043064,comment,9042514,9042514,0,0,comex,,,"> In the strange world of OccupyGPL, that’s a “restriction”, I guess because it… restricts you from placing restrictions on someone else? But that’s as silly as saying that outlawing slavery reduces freedom, because it takes away some people’s freedom to own slaves. Hey, the analogy may be inflammatory, but the logic is the same, and it doesn’t make sense in either case. The freedom to take away others’ freedom is not a meaningful freedom to have — the proper word for that is not “freedom” but “power”.<p>A more pragmatic way to put it is that it restricts you from using the code in the many real-life situations in which GPLing your entire program is simply not an option.  The ideology behind the GPL is fundamentally utopian: it starts with a result - that users of software should have the freedoms to use, modify, share, etc. - and reverse engineers the rest of the world from there, including business models that are very different from the way most companies operated at the time of its creation and now, and which are not always practical.  This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, as it leads to a quite firm and well-defined set of principles, and can serve as a lighthouse for real businesses to try to navigate towards.  But it means that individual developers often find themselves in situations where the GNU philosophy is irrelevant - while it&#x27;s talking about the choice of whether to write free or proprietary software, or this blog post is considering marginal issues like the physical difficulty of distributing source code, they have, for various reasons, already found free software unacceptable as a premise, and are faced with the choice of what software to use.  By virtue of their employment or business situation, they are not in the &quot;club&quot;, and certain software only available to the &quot;club&quot; is therefore unavailable.  From this standpoint, it&#x27;s easy to see why the GPL feels like a restriction of freedom.<p>Sometimes the premise is more mutable than it originally seems.  See &quot;Why CLISP is under GPL&quot;[1] (an email thread barely younger than I am at 22), the old Apple Objective-C thing, and probably a lot of other cases; or look at the case of the Linux kernel, where the utter technical dominance of a GPLed program over all alternatives in certain spaces (particularly embedded) has made a lot of companies who clearly want absolutely nothing to do with free software put up source release webpages.  Such examples are often cited as benefits of the copyleft strategy, and rightly so.  But for better or worse, they&#x27;re the exception rather than the rule.<p>[1] <a href=""http://clisp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/clisp/clisp/doc/Why-CLISP-is-under-GPL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clisp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/clisp/clisp/doc/Why-...</a>",1423805697

9043061,comment,9039039,9039039,0,0,geographomics,,,"Puts me in mind of a study a few years back where they had socially housed monkeys self-administer cocaine [1]. Like all primates, each group of monkeys ended up with a dominance hierarchy. The most dominant had a relatively nice life compared with the subordinates: more grooming from others, more play, more attention in general.<p>It turned out that the subordinate monkeys were much more susceptible to the temptations of cocaine. In contrast, the dominant ones were able to resist its allure a lot more effectively.<p>The researchers also looked at the neurobiology of the monkeys. Before being socially housed, they were kept in individual cages for a couple of years. They looked at the main pleasure centre of the brain and measured the level of dopamine receptors (of the D2 type) present there. These receptors are directly stimulated by naturally occurring rewards like social activity, food, sex, and so on - but also stimulant drugs like cocaine.<p>All the monkeys had pretty much the same D2 receptor level when they were cooped up in single cages, with little variation. But when they were socially housed, the D2 levels of the dominant monkeys rose significantly higher; this too was associated with their lessened vulnerability to cocaine.<p>So it seemed that social environment can have quite the effect on the neurobiology of one&#x27;s reward pathway, and potential for drug abuse (as the Rat Park experiment suggested).<p>On reward pathways - in human stimulant addicts you also see lower D2 receptor levels than in non-addicts [2], although this is lacking a comparative reading from before they were addicted, so we don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s near the state they were in when they started abusing the drug. Having said that, in non-addicts there is a natural variation in D2 receptor levels, and those with less D2 enjoy stimulants a lot more [3], just like the subordinate, lower D2 receptor monkeys.<p>Unlike Rat Park, however, all the above is based on stimulants, which directly affect the aforementioned receptors. Whereas morphine takes a more indirect route, with different receptor types, so it&#x27;s not quite comparable. Still, interesting to think about how much we may be slaves to our neurobiology, and our social surroundings.<p>[1] doi:10.1038/nn798<p>[2] doi:10.1177/026988119901300406<p>[3] doi:10.1176/ajp.156.9.1440",1423805663

-> Yes, that sounds super sketchy. The actual testimony doesn&#x27;t, though it&#x27;s one sided (below).<p>The redactions are not surprising to me. The FDA is a regulatory agency that deals with very sensitive and confidential information. They are not a criminal agency, and this isn&#x27;t some district attorney asking for the information.<p>The testimony:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
After considering the fact that the investigation results 
were preliminary and we had not received formal recommendations 
about how to take the results into account in review of the 
application, and the fact that only in very rare cases do 
inspection results from individual sites lead to the exclusion 
of an entire large clinical trial, FDA decided to hold the 
Advisory Committee meeting as planned. The Agency made this 
decision, knowing that any advice from the Committee would have 
to be later taken into account in the context of additional 
information about the integrity of data from Study 3014. It is 
not unusual for more information to come to FDA for review 
after an Advisory Committee meeting is held about an 
application. The Advisory Committee voted that the safety and 
efficacy of the requested indications had been demonstrated, 
based on the information it was provided, including Study 3014, 
and limited international post-marketing data provided at the 
meeting.
    Although the Advisory Committee recommended approval, on 
January 23, 2003, (two weeks after the Advisory Committee 
meeting) FDA issued another approvable letter to the sponsor 
because of the remaining questions about the safety of Ketek. 
The letter specifically noted the unresolved data integrity 
issues associated with Study 3014 (issues confirmed in the 
final clinical inspection summary of the Agency&#x27;s audits of the 
first three clinical trial sites) and the incomplete post-
marketing safety data from foreign countries. FDA noted that 
the final decision regarding approval of each indication would 
be made after a review of the information and analyses 
requested in this letter.
    On March 3, 2003, during a closed session of the Advisory 
Committee convened to discuss other matters, FDA briefly 
explained that an approvable letter was issued because the 
Agency wanted to see more information about data from Europe 
and Latin America. With regard to Study 3014, FDA explained 
that there were unresolved inspectional issues.
    Third Cycle. The sponsor submitted a complete response to 
the approvable letter in October 2003. The October 2003 
submission addressed issues of Study 3014 and included post-
marketing reports for spontaneous adverse events for 
approximately four million prescriptions for patients in other 
countries where Ketek had already been approved. Upon 
completing the review of the sponsor&#x27;s October submission, 
including the findings from the additional audits of clinical 
trial sites summarized in a March 2004 memorandum from the 
Division of Scientific Investigations, the Agency decided that 
it could not rely on Study 3014 to support approval of Ketek 
because of the systemic failure of the sponsor&#x27;s monitoring of 
the clinical trial to detect clearly existing data integrity 
problems. Accordingly, Study 3014 was dropped for consideration 
in making the decision whether to approve Ketek. The Agency 
considered data from other clinical trials and the 
international post-marketing experience to conclude there was 
adequate evidence of safety.

In 2011, a study conducted by six anthropologists reanalyzed Gould&#x27;s claim that Samuel Morton unconsciously manipulated his skull measurements,[82] and concluded that Gould&#x27;s analysis was poorly supported and incorrect. They praised Gould for his &quot;staunch opposition to racism&quot; but concluded, &quot;we find that Morton&#x27;s initial reputation as the objectivist of his era was well-deserved.&quot;[83] Ralph Holloway, one of the co-authors of the study, commented, &quot;I just didn&#x27;t trust Gould. ... I had the feeling that his ideological stance was supreme. When the 1996 version of &#x27;The Mismeasure of Man&#x27; came and he never even bothered to mention Michael&#x27;s study, I just felt he was a charlatan.&quot;[84] The group&#x27;s paper was reviewed in the journal Nature, which recommended a degree of caution, stating &quot;the critique leaves the majority of Gould&#x27;s work unscathed,&quot; and notes that &quot;because they couldn&#x27;t measure all the skulls, they do not know whether the average cranial capacities that Morton reported represent his sample accurately.&quot;[85] The journal stated that Gould&#x27;s opposition to racism may have biased his interpretation of Morton&#x27;s data, but also noted that &quot;Lewis and his colleagues have their own motivations. Several in the group have an association with the University of Pennsylvania, and have an interest in seeing the valuable but understudied skull collection freed from the stigma of bias.&quot;",1423804990

They have options if they choose not to follow the laws.<p>> Please explain how it&#x27;s fair that the plaintiffs would rather that everyone lose access to this educational material than deal with the fact that maybe not everyone will be able to use it.<p>They do not want everyone to lose access. Instead, what they want, is for everyone to be able to use the content.  Regardless, they do not want everyone to lose access.  Your question is merely based on ignorance of the desires of the plaintiffs.<p>> Please explain how it&#x27;s fair to act like a petulant child, screaming that if they can&#x27;t have it, nobody can.<p>Because when someone breaks the law and it harms you, you have the right to seek redress in our system.<p>I&#x27;ve answered your questions.  Now, please answer mine, which are written with the same care that you wrote yours.<p>Please explain why you feel it&#x27;s okay that organizations should be able to ignore and back out of laws they don&#x27;t agree with.<p>Please explain why you feel you have more right to the material than others.<p>Please explain what it&#x27;s like being a petulant, self-entitled child?<p>I look forward to your reply.",1423803714

I&#x27;d do what any civilized person would do and avail myself the tools at hand, vote, in the case of president/PM/Chancellor.

Live in another era, in greek times or babylonian times, their idea of what was right and wrong were different due to their frameworks.  People who believe that when they are old and frail should go out to pasture to be consumed by nature are no less right than the person who believes in life prolonging drugs, euthanasia or hospice care.<p>I&#x27;m also not saying we&#x27;re insignificant beings and nothing really matters in the face of the universe.  Just that with few exceptions, like murder, etc.  we can&#x27;t say &#x27;this is the righteous way&#x27;, the enlightened way.<p>When I work for someone, when I buy something, there is no further symbolism  -it&#x27;s unconditional.

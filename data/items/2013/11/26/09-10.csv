My best guess is that you send a message with a really obvious pattern to it, then use that pattern as a basis for sending more information.<p>For example, send a ton of examples of simple code in a simple programming language, and their output. They can figure out what it means. Then encode your messages in the programming language somehow. Send a simulation of 3 dimensional space and little objects in it interacting, for example.<p>Somewhat related: <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/</a>",1385459338

That&#x27;s the way companies make money when they segment their market and have an OS offering and a commercial one. Nothing wrong with that. If you don&#x27;t like the rules set by the creators, don&#x27;t use it; write your own software or use other software. If they had retrospectively retired features and put them into the paid version, perhaps he&#x27;d have a point, but as far as I&#x27;m aware they haven&#x27;t.<p>But what they have done is made a pretty basic marketing mistake. They decided to charge for something that has been &#x27;solved&#x27; by apache and hundreds of other pieces of software many years ago. People don&#x27;t want to pay for something that&#x27;s not new in the field.<p>>Issuing a call to arms over this is pretty obnoxious behaviour, because it implies the nginx people have done something wrong or antisocial in wanting to be paid for some of their work. How outrageous!<p>You say that like all approaches to making money are the same and it&#x27;s disingenuous. How about some document editing software that works for free for 30 days and then encrypts all of your files until you pay up? The developers just want to get paid, right? How outrageous!<p>>If you don&#x27;t like the rules set by the creators, don&#x27;t use it; write your own software or use other software.<p>That&#x27;s what he&#x27;s advocating...<p>>Ending with the exhortation &#x27;Fork it&#x27; sums up his position perfectly - someone else should fork this software, add the features I need, and then continue to work for free for me. He&#x27;s asking &#x27;Who will pick up the mantle&#x27;, because clearly it won&#x27;t be him; he&#x27;s not a sucker after all.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what good open source foundations do.

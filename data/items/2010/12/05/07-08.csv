I was 20/20 after the surgery, not quite as good now.<p>Here's how I found the doctor: I asked a bunch of other doctors who'd done theirs. Most of them had gone to the same guy. I booked him, paid a bit more than I might have paid to someone else, but I went it in with confidence.<p>Overall highly recommended.",1291535242

""For the first time, youâ€™re consciously interacting with your own brain.""</i><p>So I was at WonderWorks < <a href=""http://wonderworkspcb.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wonderworkspcb.com/index.php</a> > in early November, and they have a litle game that works based on your brain waves. You put a headband with metal nodes on your head, and it moves a ball forward based on how calm you are. You sit down across from someone and relax as much as possible, and whoever is the calmest gets the ball closer to the goal.<p>(edit: I found the page for the ""mindball"" game here: <a href=""http://wonderworkspcb.com/Content/37/Mindball_Mental_Challenge_Wonders_Panama_City_Beach_FL__"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wonderworkspcb.com/Content/37/Mindball_Mental_Challen...</a>)<p>I have to say, it was very cool. There wasn't as much shock and awe as I'm sure the headsets in this article must inspire, but you can put that down to the primitive interface I was using. It was still <i>extremely</i> interesting, because I really felt like I was ""consciously interacting with my own brain"". Making something happen just based on how calm you are... I couldn't get the smile off my face afterwards.<p>(If you're curious, I won every time.)",1291534715

1971195,comment,1970554,1970984,0,0,lockem,,,"The difference between PRK and Lasik is in the way they reshape your cornea.<p>In Lasik they create a flap by cutting the cornea and then they use a laser to reshape it, then they reposition the flap back in place.This way the flap acts as a bandage on the wound and reconnects with the cornea. The Flap is never actually healed and may be dislodged even years after the surgery - Although will need significant force like a direct poke in the eye, severe car accident etc.<p>In PRK a flap isn't created, the laser reshapes the cornea directly (After removing a small epithelial layer) and then a special bandage contact lens is applied to the wound. This is generally considered safer (Nothing to be dislodged), But the healing process is much slower and the time it takes until your eyes are at their best capacity is much longer.\nAs i previously wrote, I was back at work the next day and my sight was almost perfect after 3 days. \nMy cousin had PRK, the total healing time was around 2-3 weeks, and in the first week she could barely open her eyes.<p>PRK is also considered a little less accurate, but i am not sure why... \nFor a nice comparison see: <a href=""http://www.lasereyefacts.com/prk-vs-lasik.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lasereyefacts.com/prk-vs-lasik.html</a>",1291534612

They shut down your custom resolver, and they shut down your custom naming system. Also this proposal fails in terms of availability and resilience.<p>Also it's hierarchical P2P, so if you control the root servers, you control the naming system.

For all intents and purposes, your founders have blown through their savings and are watching as their former (regularly employed) friends are buying houses (at least putting down large down-payments) and driving nice cars while he/she is living in some crappy apartment to keep costs down.<p>In this scenario, the sane thing in my mind is to help out the entrepreneur so that he can focus on making the company huge instead of quitting the startup so he can get a job paying $300K which would let him buy a decent house for his kids.<p>Everything in life is negotiable.

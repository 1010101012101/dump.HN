3779283,comment,3778958,3778958,12,0,Cushman,,,"This seems like it could actually be a real improvement on written Latin if it adopted a real phonetic alphabet. Just transposing all of my existing graphemes for new, smaller ones seems a little silly.<p>(And since what you're really asking is not for people to learn a new alphabet, but to learn a new symbol for every word in their lexicon, it wouldn't be that much more of a leap. Think about it.)<p>Thinking about it-- you increase your bandwidth immediately. You can knock out /c/, /q/ and /x/ right off-- maybe a couple other consonants (/j/?) with creative digraphs (/gi/?). Use the extra bits to add in the more confusing vowels sounds, and appropriate current digraphs where they aren't confusing.<p>Chording becomes your standard input device; just press every sound that's in the word at once and move on. Anyone would be able to type as fast as they could talk, at least, and read far faster. Text to speech and vice versa would be much easier. Machine translation would make you perfectly legible to the non-phonetically-literate, and the vastly improved typing speed would more than make up for any minor hiccups. It would be much, much easier to teach English to children and non-natives, so much so that we'd stop using letters for everyday writing. Alphabetic English would be bizarrely unintelligible within a couple generations, but again, thanks to machine translation, perfectly readable.<p>Of course you get all of this just from having a phonetic alphabet; a concise binary representation is just icing on the cake. If your goal is to get people to read different, why not go for the grand prize?",1333165774

I ask these questions because I've noticed that astonishingly often, people online will write a definitive refutation of some scientific position or new study, which took them only a few seconds to think of and which is wrong; but <i>why</i> do they do this?<p>I can think of many possibilities, and I'm never sure what it is: do they think so poorly of the scientists conducting the study (anti-intellectualism)? do they think so highly of their own thoughts (Dunning-Krueger)? are they too stupid to realize any of this (low IQ)? are they too lazy to look up the answers in Wikipedia or Google Scholar? or is it a cynical ploy for getting upvoted comments where they count on their fellows not being knowledgeable enough to call them on it?<p>Hence, I ask questions to try to isolate what might be the issue and incidentally point out to the more reflective readers why comments like yours are fundamentally bad ideas.<p>Sometimes the spectacle is just horrifying; on a mailing list with a fairly high level of discussion of cutting-edge research on working memory and dual n-back, someone posted proudly about how they thought IQ tests were biased against Africans, and though I point out that this was obvious to him and me, even more obvious to psychometricians, he never once looked up how the tests might have been defended against or corrected for cultural biases, despite me sometimes explicitly naming the names he could punch into Google or Wikipedia.",1333164362

This doesn't show that the developers make more from Amazon app store than they make from the Play Store. That would be very hard to believe, considering there are around 60 times more ""Android"" users than Kindle Fire users.<p>But it does measure app store ""efficiency"" in relation to the iTunes store - with the Play Store being 4x less efficient (believe it or not, it used to be 50x less efficient in the past) than the iTunes store, and the Amazon store being only 11% less efficient.<p>Google's problem is their lack of a ""popular payment method"". They slacked for years with Google Checkout, and now when they need it most for Android, (almost) nobody uses it. This brings huge friction in the buying process for most Android users. Compare this to iTunes and the Amazon app store, where pretty much anyone in the Apple ecosystem had an iTunes account that they could already use to pay for stuff, and the same goes for Amazon/Kindle Fire users.<p>There are probably other factors which lower the Play Store monetization efficiency, too, but I believe that's the biggest one by far - so if Google wants to help developers make as much money from Android as they do from iOS, they need to either make Google Checkout very popular for other purposes/services <i>fast</i>, or they need to allow Paypal as a default payment method.",1333163885

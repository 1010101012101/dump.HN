You can't just dump a child like you can dump a bad startup.  I agree that many people underestimate how much you have to commit to your startup, but you there probably is a scenario in which it would be wise to give up.  It's a lot easier to think of a scenario like this for a startup (pets.com) than it is for a kid (...?...).<p>The timeframes are different.  2 years is not that much time compared to the time it takes to raise a kid.  But 2 years is a long time for a startup.",1200963001

I agree that widespread depression is a social problem, but those anecdotes about ""reason"" amount to little. Mental disorders are overdiagnosed in USA, but ""their lives suck""? Not that I dispute this entirely, but it's still quite a preposterous assumption.<p>If one can readily identify a reason for depression then they already fall into a different group of people than those who get depressed for no apparent reason.

Oh and we're not sure exactly what the business problem is, we'll need to see a few prototypes before we are able to figure it out.""<p>The amazing thing about rails is not how good it is. The amazing thing is how much better it is than most solutions in spite of how bad it is.<p>Rails is a success because it was created by someone who  has a real understanding of economics, business value, and resource limitations.

101908,comment,101888,101888,0,0,neilc,,,"What a terrible article. Leaving aside the grammar and spelling mistakes, the quote from Stonebraker is taken <i>completely</i> out of context (in the interview, he is talking about the architecture of systems for doing algorithmic trading, not relational databases in general: latency is indeed critical for algorithmic trading, but far less so for typical database applications and web apps). Then there are content-free statements like:<p>""This means you should be paying attention to your code quality, optimization ... There are built in limitations as dictated by clear and proven underlying mechanisms that prohibit current modern database and application technology from scaling much further.""<p>More broadly, I don't agree with the idea that if something makes sense for the Amazons and Googles of the world, it should be adopted for run-of-the-mill web applications. Amazon and Google can afford to write tons of infrastructure from scratch and hand-tune it to match their performance and scalability requirements; the typical web app developer cannot, but then again, the typical web app has totally different requirements. Simply generalizing from the top end of the cost vs. scalability tradeoff downward doesn't make a lot of sense. Doing joins and referential integrity in the application layer has real costs -- discarding 30 years of technology overnight has real tradeoffs that the article doesn't even bother considering.<p>The article does have one redeeming feature: the linked-to interview with Stonebraker and Margo Seltzer is worth reading. <a href=""http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1260000/1255430/p16-stanik.htm?key1=1255430&key2=3880943811&coll=&dl=ACM&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1260000/1255430/p16-stanik.h...</a>",1200961848
101907,comment,101831,101831,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"My hypothesis:  Happiness is a response your body gives you when you do something right.  Because it's somewhat outdated, it rewards hunting, eating and mating than studying or doing a desk job.  It's basically a way your genes judge how well you're doing their bidding, and it is often way off.  I see it as a byproduct of achieving other, more worthwhile goals, and not something worth pursuing for its own sake.  Your nucleus accumbens is an outdated, selfish judge of success that has too much control over your brain.  It's a bad judge.<p>I ignore it as much as I can.  Obviously, I run the risk of being unhappy.  It's probably a bad decision, and I might have to give in eventually.  I'll see how it goes.",1200961803

101904,comment,101506,101506,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"This subject is a huge can of worms.<p>On the one hand you'll have members of a largely-male audience say that there should be more women in CS and that the industry is extremely sexist.  They'll say women are wonderful.<p>Then you have the people who agree and say women are great and sexually attractive.<p>You have the people who complains at this objectification and say that it's people like these that are responsible for gross gender inequalities.<p>Then you have the people who point at IQ research.<p>Then you have people that question the validity and conclusions of the research.<p>You then have extreme self-righteousness.  Then there's blatant sexism.<p>Then someone mentions Carla Fiorina as a good example, but someone says she didn't deserve her success.<p>You get people trying really hard to put a finger on why they think men are better hackers without sounding like bigots.  They can lie on either sides of the spectrum of intellectual honesty. When scientific studies are mentioned, they can be rationalizations of bigotry or attempts at honesty and open-mindedness.<p>I hope I didn't overrepresent the point of view of any of the many sides of the argument.  I've looked over this post and alternated the order of the points of view in the sentences and paragraphs above.  However, I feel really weird about this discussion.  I suspect that no matter how hard I try to talk about these issues without taking a stand with regard to politically incorrect subjects, I'm going to look like an asshole if I don't ultimately rule in favor of the politically correct viewpoint.  But if you go so far as lying about your viewpoints in order to look politically correct, you're a bullshitter, and no less of a bigot.  On the other hand, being too concerned about the dangers of political correctness might actually make me more prejudiced.  What worries me is that there might not even be a safe zone between being a bullshitter and being a bigot.  It might be impossible to add to this topic without being either a bullshitter, a bigot, or a little of both.  But then, every person with an opinion on the subject would be an asshole in some shape or form, and that doesn't seem reasonable.  There should be a safe zone.  Of course, if you believed every politically correct statement, and you expressed those views, you'd be fine.  But how common is this?  Who can say they're totally unbiased?  Should we only let he (or she) who is without sin cast the first stone?  If we did things this way, though, guilty parties would avoid getting a stoning they may deserve.<p>It's a can of worms.  There's not a lot you can say without someone going ad hominem on you.<p>It is not a bad idea to put this kind of question on Hacker News; it is supposed to be an open forum about what things interesting to hackers.  But because it is an open forum, try not to wantonly go around chastising other posters.<p>As a reader, you should know what you're in for when you choose to read this link.  People can say whatever they want, and they will.  Sometimes they'll be too politically correct, sometimes they won't be politically correct enough.  On top of that, there's the bullshit from both sides.  You might end up reading something you'll find personally hurtful.  But then, this is a forum.  People have been asked not to be mean, and for the most part they'll try not to be. But if you don't want to risk being hurt, don't go into the forum.<p>I didn't write this very well.  I apologize.  I wound up being pedantic, too.  And I said some things that might cost me.  But I can't keep rewriting this and make semantic barricades that I can later hide behind.  I can't censor myself based on what future employers and people like that might think when they google me.",1200961185

9940305,comment,9938547,9940127,0,0,fbrusch,,,"Claiming there&#x27;s no difference between prediction and understanding reminds me to what philosophers of science call  &quot;instrumentalism&quot;: theories are only to be judged by how well they work in predicting facts. But imagine a world in which Newton, instead of formulating the law of universal gravitation and the laws of motion, built a complex machine that, given the relative positions of a set of planets, could work out their subsequent trajectories, with astonishing precision. Nobody would be able to explain why it works in any &quot;deeper&quot; way. Would that world be undistinguishable by ours? If anything, would have Einstein had the same chances of devising general relativity? And Schwarzschild of deriving from it that black holes should exist? Doesn&#x27;t the fact that we care whether black holes exist, despite how little they admittedly influence the set of mundane phenomena we observe everyday, imply that this world is distinguishably different from that with the accurate, hypothetical Newton black box?",1437717558

The formations get complex with higher levels. I prefer to keep the game simple with no flashy backgrounds and shiny objects. The players can choose between two background colors (black/white) depending on the color contrast they prefer.<p>Currently, it has 10 levels and I plan to add more levels. I plan to keep it ad free.

I forget the name (kinda telling) but it was an all star team of physicists and nobel prize winners doing some triangular arbitrage (?) and then blowing up spectacularly. Apart from HFT, lot of quant or algorithm based funds never seems to last longer than the market will let them. You see successful money managers but rarely are they quant based strategists. It never made sense as to why you would need so much science in a field where investing and trading is an art half of the time.

9940278,comment,9935471,9940069,0,0,epidemian,,,"> I feel that requiring the `()` to invoke it as a function at least hints that &quot;this does stuff&quot; rather than hiding the implementation in a getter. Does that make sense?<p>It does. But don&#x27;t you feel that making that distinction makes the code more inflexible for (arguably) little gain?<p>To put a concrete example, let&#x27;s consider an &quot;items left&quot; property of a TODO list:<p><pre><code>  class TodoList {\n    // ...\n    itemsLeft() {\n      return _.count(this.todos, todo => !todo.done)\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nitemsLeft was defined as method because it&#x27;s computed by iterating a list, so we deem it non-trivial. But let&#x27;s say that later on we discover that a better internal structure for our TodoList is to have the unfinished and finished todo&#x27;s in different lists, so our itemsLeft becomes &quot;trivial&quot;:<p><pre><code>  class TodoList {\n    // ...\n    itemsLeft() {\n      return this.unfinishedTodos.length\n    }\n  } \n</code></pre>\nIf using getters is preferable for trivial properties, should we then change itemsLeft to be a getter and refactor the existing code that uses it?<p>Besides, there&#x27;s the problem of having to draw a line between trivial and non-trivial code (e.g., &quot;is string concatenation trivial?&quot;, &quot;but it&#x27;s O(n+m) on the lengths of the strings!&quot;, etc). Using always the same style for accessors (either plain-old methods or getters), regardless of how complex the underneath code is, frees us from having to make this consideration in the first place and also leaves the door open for changing an object&#x27;s implementation without changing its public interface.<p>---<p>I feel this perception probably depends on the language background tough. E.g., in languages like Ruby you always interact with objects via messages, so you never have this distinction of whether something is computed or not from a the caller&#x27;s perspective (or at least not in a syntactic level).<p>But it&#x27;s weird that this distinction is made in JS though, as many of the classic JS APIs have computed properties that &quot;do stuff&quot;, and quite a lot! (e.g., Node#textContent). My guess is that most likely it&#x27;s a result of the language lacking user-definable getters and setters for such a long time.",1437716956

Valve&#x27;s Steam Controller prototypes were done using 3D printers and interesting discussions of how expensive a mass production mold system surfaced suggesting the kinds of numbers that were needed to make it viable.<p>There was an interesting article I saw in the past week dispelling myths about &#x27;you&#x27; and manufacturing, emphasizing that Chinese factories are generally not desperate for your small orders.

All this customization weakens the ability of mass production to win out. Now you start looking like the specialized PC market like the gamer laptops which charge premiums for their niche. Then the &quot;Linux enthusiasts&quot; have even more pressure to buy a more mainstream laptop because of the price differential. And unlike the gamer market (or the Apple market), there isn&#x27;t a clear history of &quot;Linux enthusiasts&quot; willing to pay a premium for stuff.<p>Finally, the current profit numbers for the PC industry look bleak for the long term.

The whole point was that it WASN'T about the technology - it was that he's so in touch with his audience that within 4 hours of it coming to his attention, he was able to do two iterations, get feedback on both, and fix a bug. It took 4 hours because we were communicating asynchronously on a message board, but I'm pretty sure he could have done it live if I had him on the phone. Simply put, I was more impressed that he gave a crap than that he could push a code change.<p>I am at one of those ""average"" shops, as are most people (by definition, although maybe not in the HN community).  I know this stuff is possible but we can't do it here, and neither can most sites.<p>To put it in perspective, if you found a bug in your bank's website and told them about it, how long would it take for them to fix it? Even worse, what if you suggested a way to make the site work better? Would anyone with decision making power ever even see the suggestion? Just try telling someone WHO'S NOT A GEEK this story and see what they say.  I wrote the article because when I told my wife what happened, her jaw hit the floor.",1200581790

    With a lot of java experience, I can say that it is more elaborate and laborious in Java than python or ruby.

Using Lisp just makes it a breeze.",1200581097

99782,comment,99520,99520,0,0,mixmax,,,"the idea is great but the implementation not so. Certainly there is a correlation between where the user points his mouse and where he looks - but it is pretty small. Especially when pictures and multimedia are involved people tend to move their mouse out of the way.<p>With a high enough quality webcam and flash (which will allow you to stream from the cam) it should be possible, not easy but possible, to get pictures of the eyes and track their movement. The cons of this approach are:<p>1) you need to get the users permission to view captures from their cam - major irritation and bad usability.<p>2) the software to anslyse the pictures is quite complex<p>3) the cam needs to be of a pretty good quality<p>4) It will be hard to determine the coordinates of the cam in relation to the monitor, though it is probably possible to approximate it, since you can assume that the user is staring at the screen his eye movement will be confined to a square of space somewhere in front of him (the monitor). If data is gathered for a while it should be possible to approximate where the screen is in relation to the cam.",1200579547

Backup of portables was always tricky, because a wire had to be connected first. Thus it was forgotten most of the time.<p>For the MacBook air, it looks nice, no doubt, but it is either dependend on another machine (optical drive) or needs a table full of accessories (optical drive, usb hub). We already left this behind 10 years ago, didn't we? Anyone who wants back a table full of cables and clutter?",1200578673

6992813,comment,6991590,6992601,1,0,001sky,,,"This would work with anything that can be budgeted reasonably well in advance. The US has had things like health-savings accounts where you stash some pre-tax cash away to pay out of pocket medical costs. This requires some estimation, and from this amount you draw down every year. If you messed up the estimation you would lose your cash or would have to use after-tax cash (payment penalty). So, if this type of risk profile works for healthcare payments, it could easly work for certain amounts and types of online payments. at least in terms of the transaction cost part. Managing fraud and risk of theft of the coin wallets would be the next step, but these don&#x27;t seem insurmountable. Whatever entropy is lost in the system is likeley worth the losses, in the eyes of certain users. Certainly, the economics are better than...money laundering! and the anonymity value even for &#x27;normal&#x27; people may be worth a certain amount, when the downside risks (eg, of political activity) may have such severe reprocussions that are dis-proportionate to the actual usages. The main problem with this is that the FBI and the NSA basically equate valid reasons for anonymity with kiddie-porn and the boogie-man, so that will be interesting to see how it plays out. Also, the international transaction fees on credit cards can be pretty substantial (you are converting currencies...), and this might also be a classic case of efficient use. Notwithstanding the current asset volatility, which makes bitcoin a poor currency-substitute at the moment.",1388523597

Employer-provided healthcare is one of the key obfuscators of the cost of healthcare as far as patients are concerned.<p>It also has secondary effects in employment markets:<p>* employers should not be encouraged to replace full-time workers with part-time workers because of health insurance costs<p>* employees shouldn&#x27;t be making decisions about careers and jobs based on what health insurance costs will be<p>* the actual compensation levels between jobs is harder to evaluate since health benefits can be a huge chunk of compensation these days",1388523589

The second one is a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) overlay network providing key/value storage for user resources and tracker location for the third network.

I can do that, but it takes time and effort to maintain secure systems.  The real kicker is if something goes wrong, its my problem. If someone hacks my netbanking details the bank will cover my losses.<p>So what does Bitcoin offer? it opens up transactions that would have otherwise been too risky. Irreversible electronic transactions are Bitcoins niche.  However that fact makes it very difficult to acquire Bitcoins with reversible payment methods.  This slows down the process of entering and exiting the Bitcoin market leaving you vulnerable to the volatile exchange rate.<p>I really want Bitcoin to succeed but at this stage there is no way I would use Bitcoin for a transaction unless it was the only option.",1388523457

Unlike the federal law, however, New York does not require consumers to purchase coverage, so over time, mainly older, sicker people, have purchased coverage. That drove up prices and discouraged younger, healthier people from buying policies, as did a requirement that insurers charge the same rates regardless of age or health status.<p>As a result, premium prices listed for individuals often top $1,000 a month for some New Yorkers buying their own coverage, making the state&#x27;s rates among most expensive in the nation.</i><p><a href""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/20/kaiser-new-york-insurance-premiums/2570873"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/20/kaise...</a><p>And the old New York model of a lousy risk pool with unaffordable premiums is where ACA is potentially headed if the individual mandate &quot;tax&quot; isn&#x27;t given much teeth.",1388523408

Find an exploit in the iPhone&#x27;s mail, sms, browser, or any other app, and you could too install malware. Of course this is not easy with the security of the iPhone, but with NSA like resources there is no such thing as bulletproof security.",1388522870

It&#x27;s worth knowing why a company might quote you, $10K for some work versus another $50K. Is one company using PHP or ASP.NET? Does one company&#x27;s quote include all tasks such as requirement&#x27;s gathering, mock-ups, development and production deployment. Where does system testing and end user testing fit into all of it? What&#x27;s the hosting costs after the fact. Are they using Rackspace, AWS or their own provider and charging $300 a month for it.<p>I think a smart person can take a good 30-50 hours and read up on all this and get a good grounding as there is no lack of materials to get this knowledge from. I don&#x27;t need to know the intricate details of how to build a car to appreciate the manufacturing process for a car. We all know there are many makes and models of cars but the design and manufacturing, distribution and sales of cars follow similar patterns (not taking into account the new entrants such as Tesla).<p>As an added check, a non-technical founder should find a trusted technical person that can help guide the development of the product even if the technical person themselves won&#x27;t build it.<p>I think doing this would go a long way to get something built and off the ground. It&#x27;s easy for a lot of us who have grown up with technology and understand computers, the internet, programming languages, algorithms, software development etc. but for the non-technical person who grew up as a user of the tech not but not a tinkerer its hard to catch up and go beyond and build a product (even an MVP).",1388522232

Hoffmann<p>Just an amazing book giving what seems like the secret details how of the world works at a physical level.<p>&quot;Thus, the nanoscale is truly special. Only at the nanoscale is the thermal energy of the right magnitude to allow the formation of complex molecular structures and assist the spontaneous transformation of different energy forms (mechanical, electrical, chemical) into one another. Moreover, the conjunction of energy scales allows for the self-assembly, adaptability, and spontaneous motion needed to make a living being. The nanoscale is the only scale at which machines can work completely autonomously. To jump into action, nanoscale machines just need a little push. And this push is provided by thermal energy of the molecular storm.&quot;<p>&quot;At the nanoscale, nothing can escape the molecular storm. As Astumian and Hänggi point out, every molecular machine in our bodies is hit by a fast-moving water molecule about every 10−13 seconds. Each collision delivers on average 4.3 × 10−21 joules of energy (the energy is determined by the product of Boltzmann’s constant and body temperature measured in degree Kelvin). This translates into an average power input of more than 10−8 watts. Remember that a molecular machine generates only about 10−16 watts in power.&quot;<p>&quot;Where do molecules obtain the needed activation energy? From the molecular storm! The impetus needed to make it across the transition state is provided by small, fast molecules (typically water molecules) fortuitously colliding with the reacting molecules to give them the right push. If lucky, the push causes the molecules to snap into their new shapes. Of course, not every colliding water molecule will have enough energy or hit the reacting molecules in the right way. Chemical reactions take time— we have to wait for the right push to come along, and the higher the activation energy needed, the more time it takes, as higher-energy collisions are much less frequent than low-energy collisions.&quot;",1388522118

The other phone manufacturers didn&#x27;t come out with relevant, equivalently capable competitors to the iPhone in 2008 because it was physically impossible for anyone do so, even for a platform company with deep pockets like Microsoft, in that time frame. Even Android took years to redevelop so it could get even close.<p>There was nothing lazy about adopting Android, the handset manufacturers had no other viable choice. The advantage Apple had opened up was wide enough that even WebOS, which was arguably even closer to catching up than Android, failed because it didn&#x27;t have the same level of long term investment and support from an experienced software company that Google gave to Android.

Selection criteria that expects someone to have ~10 years “hacking” experience prior to choosing YC is biased heavily in favour of people who already have accumulated advantages that permit them that exploration time (and are encouraged to do so in that particular direction) and against people who do not. This means that women are underrepresented because technical/engineering disciplines are not seen as “acceptable” for girls to do; certain visible minorities are underrepresented because, at least in America, race is strongly correlated to income and corresponding free time.

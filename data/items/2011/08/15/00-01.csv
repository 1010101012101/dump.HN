I might have to buy one so I can develop stuff like this.<p>For those who are interested, if you have a laptop with an intel based graphics card, you are probably using something called Mesa. After researching for a long time, Mesa is some sort of a graphics driver that works on Linux. Apparently, if you have Mesa 7.10+ and Firefox 6 webgl works, though I haven't figured out how to upgrade Mesa. The default on Ubuntu 10.04 is 7.4 or something like that. Apparently, Mesa is pretty buggy and can crash a lot.<p>If anyone has more info about this subject, I would appreciate it.",1313369866

In fact, I take pride if I can add 700 lines but remove 1500 (C++).<p>This is because writing code is relatively simple, whereas understanding it and ultimately maintaining it is very hard.  So aiming to write more code is a very poor objective, you should be aiming to keep a project maintainable so that your costs are low (in terms of time, bug frequency, etc.).<p>That doesn't mean new features won't require lots of code, but there should be some way to prune old code on the same schedule.",1313369823

2884953,story,,,2,8,pierreminik,"Ask HN: Is your super market picking on you too?",,"I know this is gonna come off like I'm completely paranoid but I think my super market is picking on me. I think they are deliberately trying to annoy me by teasing me with all sorts of random stuff. It's like they don't like me, even though I've never done anything but pay them for their products, and it's like they are trying to get rid of me by annoying me so much I just won't come back. It's gonna sound ridiculous but try to bare with me and hear what I have to say.<p>The thing is they're always moving around the stuff I need, putting it in places I wouldn't think off when trying to find them. When I give up and want to ask staff for help, they first will hide from me even though when I don't need them they are always getting in the way. Then they act as if if they don't know what I'm speaking about or that they never sold the items I want to buy.<p>They put so many products in there I'm completely unable to choose and it's not even like I actually have a choice because the products are the same in different packages and brands. Like they have 9 different licorice but they're all soft salty salmiak.<p>They wear uniforms to confuse me. At first I can't tell if I've spoken with the person before and if I can save some time by not having to explain the whole situation. After a while it comes clear to me that it's the exact same person. Always smiling, pleasant and answering the questions in the same unhelpful way: ""Try the fridge room, I'm sorry I can't help you further but that's not my area."" That would've been great direction advice if only the fridge room wasn't over 9.000 square meters while the product I want is tiny.\nThe staff loves to mess with me as well. When I've realized it's the same person as previously and I try to make some benefit from our history, they'll get all weird.<p>Then there's the labeling. They put them on the shelf but not near the products I want so I have to figure out what the item is called only to realize that knowing the name is not even enough to determine the price because I have to know which amount it is. And it's not like they just have a small and large version, they use illogical amounts and put the amount declaration on on the package in hard to discover places.<p>Sometimes they claim they are out of stock of the product I want. This is after I've spent long time searching for it because they fill up the shelfs with the products they <i>do</i> have in stock so I can't tell what happened to my product. Combining the moving my products around and filling up the shelfs and displacing labels makes it very hard for me to find my product.\nThey even pretend not knowing if they discontinued selling the stuff I want. Sometimes they haven't had my stuff for a long time and the place they had it in last still has the label on the shelf but the products nearby has nothing to do with what I want.<p>And they are constantly coming up with new ways to pick on me. The newest approach is having this ""buy more""-discount. They put large attention demanding labels on random products. They know I'm all for saving some pennies so they find the things I could be attracted to and write ""Buy 2 for 9.99"" while a single unit is priced 8.99. That might sound nice if it wasn't because they'd only put a single product of that kind in sight so I have to search the entire store for the second companion.<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg and I think you're getting what I'm saying. So what I want to know if they are picking on you too?",1313369310

2884918,comment,2883820,2884665,2,0,bluekeybox,,,"> Your basic argument is that if X sometimes causes problems, we should be glad to see X gone.<p>That's not my basic argument. My basic argument is that the very concept of ""big"" ideas as defined by Gabler is fundamentally flawed because: (1) the ""bigness"" factor of an idea he uses is a measure of how influential the idea is; (2) ill-informed people (think children, some rural communities etc) are much, much easier to influence than well-informed ones; and finally (3) there were proportionally many more ill-informed people in the past than there are today.<p>So we might as well be in the golden age of ideas but neither one of them ever becomes ""big"" because they are all in fierce competition with each other. Or perhaps not -- but the basic point is that the way we measure this ""bigness"" is flawed.<p>> American nationalism isn't the same idea as Chinese nationalism or Indian nationalism.<p>Of course it isn't. America was founded before the wave of nationalism took over Europe. American nationalism is to European nationalism as ham is to hamster -- only the name is similar. Nationalism in most countries in the world was modeled on European nationalism. Examples: Lebanese nationalist Kataeb party was modeled on Spanish and Italian Fascist parties (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kataeb_Party"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kataeb_Party</a>). Pakistani nationalism stems from utopian visions of Muhammad Iqbal, an idealist poet influenced by Romanticism (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal</a>). Ukrainian nationalism holds as holy  populist-Romanticist ideas of Taras Shevchenko (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko</a>) and owes its ideologic form to Dmytro Dontsov (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmytro_Dontsov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmytro_Dontsov</a>).<p>One of my biggest realization in the past years has been that nationalism isn't some ""natural"" tribal tendency but an ideology like any other that only uses (""perverts"") the tribal tendencies for its own purpose and which was built and formulated nearly exclusively on a populist form of Romanticism that spread throughout Europe in the middle of 19th century (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_nationalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_nationalism</a>).",1313368010

I worry especially regarding point 2) that Scrivener lets people work in parallel when they should be working in serial, with one event driving another organically. Too much amateur writing I see is, for lack of a better term, plotless: meandering around feelings, or random encounters, or designed to show how <i>deep</i> the author isinstead of telling a story.<p>Scrivener will help with some things, as I've written elsewhere, but I'm not sure it's really enough for the vast majority of what writers and would-be writers are working on.",1313368002

I still find myself placing far too much importance in it when judging people, can only imagine how big headed I would be about it if she hadn't constantly reminded me how little IQ really means.<p>Stephen Fry made a similar, though briefer, point (I think in one of his auto-biographies, though I could be wrong)... Actually instead of quoting from memory I googled, it is indeed from his first auto-biography, and here it is:<p><i>""I actually went so tragically far as to send off for and complete a Mensa application test...It was only then I realised the kind of intelligence that wants to get into Mensa and succeeds in getting into Mensa and then runs Mensa and the kind of intelligence that I thought worth possessing were so astronomically distant from each other that the icing fell off the cake with a great squelch.It is occasions like this I thank God for my criminal tendencies, my homosexuality, my jewishness and loathing of the bourgeois, the conventional and respectable that these seem to have inculcated me.

6752,comment,6716,6718,0,0,brezina,,,"In my mind there is no question that the limiting factor is Paul's time.  The amount of time Paul spends with his portfolio of companies is the integral of the number of companies he funds with 50% decay to account for companies that quit.  There is obviously a physical limit at 24 hrs/day.",1175043113

6750,comment,6716,6716,0,0,staunch,,,"I think PG's essays and YCN can be a huge boost to scaling YC itself. He wrote of attempting of Huffman coding in the ""hardest lessons"" essay, perhaps he could also reference comment IDs as well. Maybe something more forum-like is necessary though, where topics can be marked ""sticky"" forever.<p>If each group of founders leaves behind their answers in a permanent form it seems like that would help with most of the common questions, leaving only the tricky new questions to be answered.",1175042662

6742,comment,6668,6668,0,0,domp,,,"Paul, I really liked your point about the change in the business world. I also feel that the current model is shifting into a more favorable situation for individuals.<p>I think it might be the change in perception. My parents, and people around their age, seem to have a different perspective on what a job means. They see work as a smaller role in their life. ""Work just pays the bills"". But most younger generations seem to put more of an emphasis on their careers. They see work as the main part of their life. It could be due to the amount of money that we pay for college tuition. I know I don't want to waste my degree and years of my life doing someone else's work. I'd rather have the comfort and responsibility to be left alone to do my own work. Maybe I'm just speaking about my own situation.<p>

Unless I missed it, PG never mentions good product ideas targeted at businesses, so I am unclear as to where there is a contradicition. His mantra is to go for a wide user base, which typically requires mainstream business ideas, i.e., business-to-consumer, not business-to-business.",1175041327
6740,comment,6668,6708,0,0,pg,,,"Part of the reason the number of applications isn't that much higher than it was the first time is that we've changed our approach to founders. Initially we pitched YC as a substitute for a summer job for students.  Then we realized that we wanted people more committed than that-- that it was actually bad to fund people still in school, in fact, because it's so easy for them to give up.  <p>We will fund people still in school.  (The founders of Weebly were.) But they have to be serious about starting a company.",1175041275

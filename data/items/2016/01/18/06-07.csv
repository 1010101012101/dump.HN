I got an email that my credit card had expired, so I put in the details for the new credit card. I hadn&#x27;t even realized I was still paying for Adobe CC, so I then called to cancel the service. Support agent went through this same script, I was forced to pay the absurd termination fee and thought that was the end of it.<p>I got an email the next day thanking me for updating my Credit Card information and that my Adobe Creative Cloud subscription  had been renewed because the charge on the new credit card info went through.

10922985,comment,10922527,10922716,0,0,asuffield,,,"Where did you find that 2.7m number? The most recent data is the Credit Suisse 2015 set, which you can see here:<p><a href=""https://www.credit-suisse.com/uk/en/about-us/research/research-institute/news-and-videos/articles/news-and-expertise/2015/10/en/global-wealth-in-2015-underlying-trends-remain-positive.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.credit-suisse.com/uk/en/about-us/research/resear...</a><p>They put the 1% line at $760k, and that&#x27;s net worth: include the value of your home, subtract your debts.<p>I&#x27;m pretty unhappy about this oxfam article. It talks about &quot;the richest 1%&quot; and &quot;the billionaires&quot; alongside each other as if these groups were even remotely similar. This is furthering the myth of some kind of group of &quot;shady rich people&quot; who are behind the global financial conspiracy. Reality check: if you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re almost certainly in the top 10% ($68,845 in total assets). According to the same data set, the median wealth in the US is $50k, so about half the population is in the top ten percent. You are the rich people this article is talking about.<p>Comparing the &quot;richest 80 billionaires&quot; to the bottom 50% is similarly misleading, because the bottom 50% has about 0.5% of the global wealth (which I think roughly answers your question about the top 0.001%). If you lined up the top 80 billionaires, shot them all, and redistributed all their wealth to the bottom 50%, then those people would still be in extreme poverty.<p>There are serious global wealth inequality problems, and this oxfam article doesn&#x27;t really talk about them at all, and instead tries to perpetuate a popular meme. I strongly suggest that people skip it and read the Credit Suisse report instead - the data tells a much more interesting story.<p>Here are the numbers which the oxfam article doesn&#x27;t mention, and should:<p>85.65% of the global wealth is held by the top 10% of the population, which is 477m people, of which 113m are in the US, with second place going to Japan at 58m.<p>32.3% of global wealth is held by the middle class (defined as $50k to $500k wealth); 92.4% is held by the middle class or above. 37% is in the US. Africa, India, and Latin America together represent about 4%.",1453100341

Peru is not a flavor. It&#x27;s an origin. This is going to turn off anyone that knows anything about coffee.<p>Your coffee flavor page states &quot;Learn about all our delicious coffee flavors:&quot; But there is nothing on that page that teaches you anything. There is no information. What&#x27;s a &quot;viennese roast&quot;, for example? (I know, you don&#x27;t need to explain). What towns in Peru did that coffee come from? Who&#x27;s the farmer? What&#x27;s the difference between various South American origin coffees? There is no information on this page.<p>The descriptions of the coffees all sound the same. One has a &quot;rich finish&quot;, the next has a &quot;rich flavors and a smooth finish&quot;, and the other a &quot;rich, smooth finish&quot;.<p>As a point of contrast, go to Sweet Marias and read their descriptions. I&#x27;m not saying you need to go to their level, but &quot;rich&quot; is not descriptive. At most its evocative. And it means nothing when all your choices say &quot;rich&quot;. Are their fruit notes? If so, which fruits? Are there cacao flavors? Is there sweetness, or funk? Are they wet or dry processed?<p>Next, go here: <a href=""http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/products/coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/products/coffee</a>\nThat&#x27;s informative. There prices are in line with yours, but they are offering single origin, sourced coffee - you are buying coffee from one collective or even one farmer, and a specific harvest date. You know what friggin altitude the coffee was grown at. If you want your coffee ground, you get 14 grind choices.<p>It&#x27;s places like Sweet Maria&#x27;s and Intelligentsia that are doing good in the world. They form relationships with the farmers, they help educate them on what the market wants from coffee, they offer a dependable demand so that the farmer can trust that if they make an investment that the product will find a market, and they help raise support premium prices so the farmer can make a good wage and justify growing premium coffee (as opposed to pumping out mid grade, forgettable beans to be sold by Starbuck and the like). In contrast, I read your faq. You sell &quot;fair trade&quot; coffee. That&#x27;s a pretty meaningless term. Are you associated with Fair Trade USA (note the capital letters), the non profit that certifies transactions? Or what? Fair trade is pretty well considered a scam - for a farmer to get certification often costs more than the increased bean price yields him. Direct trade is far more beneficial to the farmer.<p>I just don&#x27;t get the impression (from the site) that you know anything about coffee. And you only have 3 choices. Why would I buy from you? I guess the causes? Of the $20 you want for 12 ounces of coffee (ouch), 2 goes to a cause. I click on animal cause. Nothing there but coming soon.<p>Why would I choose you over, say, blue bottle (I&#x27;m going to guess they are your roaster)? I can get that 12 oz bag for $14 from them, there are far more choices, I can get single origins instead of blends, I can get equipment, etc. You can cancel a subscription at any time with them. With you, tough luck, you&#x27;re paying for, and getting coffee for a year no matter what.<p>Your subscription choices are extremely limited. Who is into coffee enough to pay $26 dollars (with shipping) for 12oz of coffee, and then only drink 12oz in a month? That&#x27;s one week of coffee, maybe two, depending on the person.<p>I try to place an order, just to see all the info. Earlier, when I clicked on &#x27;animal causes&#x27; it just said coming soon. So, being a bastard, when you ask me to specify a cause I choose animal causes, because I wanted to see what error you pop up. Nope, you take it. Hmm. Are you just taking my money too, or are going to use that $2 &quot;at some point&quot;?  You tell me &quot;local nonprofits&quot;, but the animal link I clicked showed an elephant. It&#x27;s not adding up. I clicked around some more, it looks like you sent $50 to Muira Village. That ain&#x27;t local. The last progress report was in October! No way I&#x27;d ever send money to a website like this, the information is mostly nonexistent, and the info that does exist contradicts itself.<p>Anyway, there is nothing on your site to create a customer, so I&#x27;m not surprised your customer acquisitions costs are exorbitant. You must have to make the sale elsewhere, because you aren&#x27;t doing it on your site.<p>Are you into coffee? Do you enjoy coffee? Do you know coffee? What&#x27;s the game plan here? To me it seems like you are buying beans from somebody else, and don&#x27;t understand coffee terms or consumption patterns. If true, is this the right business for you? If you are knowledgeable and passionate about coffee, then please show it on your site.<p>Probably not a fun thing to read, but bottom line, why would a customer choose you over Intelligencia, Espresso Vivace, Counter Culture, Terroir, Klatch, etc? Because they are your competitors; there is no extra friction for me to click on their link instead of yours, and the prices are the same. Give me lower costs, give me more selections, give me a better education, give me better ordering choices, give me <i>something</i> to choose you over award winning, well known brands with strong roots in making the lives of coffee farmers better (trying to tie in the non-profit, help the world angle you have).",1453100158

The latter says that the efficacy of the former grants those people a moral <i>right</i> to those fruits.<p>The former is almost certainly true - capitalism is much more effective at accelerating efficiency and innovation than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.

I&#x27;m positively surprised, constructive discussion on internet!<p>There&#x27;s been some discussion about using Rust.<p>Rust is an interesting language, and has definitely potential substituting C and C++ in some domains. The main reason I&#x27;m not so interested in using it is for game development, is because it&#x27;s more complicated than C (like C++), and the complications are a bit off from what I&#x27;d want (like in C++). Just a quick googling reveals that rust mangles names by default, and doesn&#x27;t have reflection, so I&#x27;d probably be in for a lot of negative surprises. Add that with being indifferent about the absolute security, and soon my code is mostly inside unsafe blocks so that I don&#x27;t have to spend time convincing the compiler my pointers are safe. Maybe. I haven&#x27;t done much programming in Rust. There are some nice convenience features though, when comparing to C, but they seem to be rather minor things.<p>It comes down to choosing between two non-ideal solutions. I value simplicity more than some, so favoring the simpler one feels more natural to me. Sure, when you need the safety then Rust seems like a decent choice.",1453100060

This is the flaw in our money that makes our political system degrade from democracy to capitalism. Votes can be bought, so counting votes is a charade that disguises the fact that the tally of money on each side of an issue matters most.<p>To fix this, we must fix our money. When someone spends money they got from wealthy people for manipulating our politics, the person who accepts it is fulfilling the promise the money held in the first place. We must refuse to empower money used in this way. As individuals, we must reject money in our own lives when it came from political manipulation so we can remove the incentive to participate in political manipulation.<p>This is merit capitalism. The technology to make it work exists today, and it doesn&#x27;t require the impossible task of winning votes in a Congress we can&#x27;t afford to buy back from the rich. It requires tools to make it easy to reject dirty money and spreading the knowledge that rejecting dirty money is even possible. These are things that we can do.

That said, you <i>might</i> be able to write a cross-platform game through open source Foundation/AppKit implementations like GNUStep and Cocotron, but keep in mind that they implement a version of Foundation that’s several versions behind now.<p>The next closest thing is probably Swift alongside Apple’s FOSS reimplementation of Foundation for Swift, though I don’t know how well Swift works for development with OpenGL and such.",1453096873

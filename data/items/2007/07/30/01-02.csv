Up until last year, mine was running on a 586 with 32 MB of EDO-RAM (remember that stuff?), from my parents' house.<p>I think you'd have to stick to myspace pages, and, well, I think we both know that's a bad idea.",1185760513

We applied to ycombinator, got the in-person interview, but didn't make the summer program. You can't win them all.<p>I made this because I felt there's really no simple & fast way to take down short notes (meeting/class notes, todos, brainstorming, random links) online. I don't know about you, but I've been using Gmail drafts, writely, and 37signals stuff for some time and it's not really designed for this use case. I find myself thinking ""just show me my notes -- don't make me click on a link to see each one"" when I use products like Gmail drafts. <p>So here's our stab at this market. It follows the same design philosophy I try to use everywhere -- simple, lean, focused. If you've ever watched a casual computer user flounder when trying a new web2.0 app, you'll know the value of being brutally straight-forward and obvious. Jjot is obvious: you've got a bunch of boxes that look like paper notes, and you can type in them. There's a lot more to it, but that's the gist.<p>We launched recently and the reception has been pretty good. We were on delicious popular over the weekend, and were (inexplicably) moved from that list to web2.0 popular-\n<a href=""http://del.icio.us/popular/web2.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://del.icio.us/popular/web2.0</a><p>There's been a few posts about Jjot on the web, including one from lifehacker. Now that we've got a few users to get feedback from and improve the service, we can really work on getting some more traction. Running a service with users is 5x as fun as the building stage. All of a sudden, a lot of people care about and take notice of each change you make.<p>I'd love to hear any comments/ideas/criticisms; news.yc always has good product feedback. If anyone is curious as to how this thing is built (it uses some fancy client-side coding), I'd be happy to talk about it.",1185760115

37536,comment,37246,37371,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I for one don't like the idea that the only way to ""give something back"" is to do philanthropy. Any gain in happiness and productivity is a good thing. If you have had success, continuing to be successful probably means giving people both. Keep working.<p>An example of comparative advantage: it doesn't make sense for a $500/hr lawyer to do pro-bono work for the poor. It would make more sense to work for that hour and use the income to fund 10 $50/hr lawyers. The benefit would be much higher for those in need.<p>So my point is that charity isn't necessarily the best way to give back to society. ",1185757618

Reply to: see below<p>We're not looking to stick cogs in a big machine, we need people who can do pretty much everything and immediately learn how to do the rest. Before even thinking about the skills, we're looking for you to be:<p>An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all - we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. We need you to buck up and grind through random tasks, server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.
A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?
Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. Everyone helps with tech support, schmoozing at swank parties, hosting events, coming up with new and ever-more-ridiculous marketing stunts, etc. And if you code, you'll code everything: you might do mobile one day, front-end design, back-end optimization, low-level debugging, the works. This is not a monkey job - you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.
Even more talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL -- not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what we mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.
Basically, we're looking for people who want to do amazing things with their careers, and who are searching for a way to get started or take the next incredible step. Does this sound like you? If so, applying is easy, but it takes some time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:<p>Note: Be verbose! There are no time or word limits; tell us your story in as much detail as you can. Provide links, photos, videos -- whatever you've got. Before sending, ask yourself: ""Knowing nothing else but what's said here, would I hire this guy/gal?"" If not, rewrite it. This is your time to shine; make the most of it!<p>What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?
What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?
What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?
Please forward this application to three people you think we should hire, cc'ing jobs@expensify.com. (Don't worry, we're eager to hire you and them. Indeed, good people have good friends: solid referrals here increase the odds we'll hire you.)
How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.
That's it. Email answers to the above to jobs@expensify.com. If you make an honest attempt to answer all the questions, we'll make an honest attempt to reply in a timely fashion. We can't wait to hear from you soon!<p>More info here, including pictures, videos, stories, and more! https://www.expensify.com",1312829857

All for output of 800 lumens.<p>A recent LED flashlight can produce 800 lumens with just 1 (CREE XM-L) LED.  For example, <a href=""http://www.fenixlight.com/viewproduct.asp?id=141"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fenixlight.com/viewproduct.asp?id=141</a>  If you want a warmer white tint, it's a little less lumens, but you can always use 2 LEDs..<p>LEDs have come a long way in the last couple of years.  It's just unfortunate that light bulb manufacturers do not make and sell new models as quickly as flashlight companies.  There seems to be a new model every week with the latest LED for crazy light output.<p>Another example, <a href=""http://www.fenixlight.com/viewproduct.asp?id=149"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fenixlight.com/viewproduct.asp?id=149</a>  It does over 2,000 lumens with 3 LEDs!!  This is just one company.  There are many more that also have crazy flashlights.<p>If you want to learn more about LEDs or flashlights, head over to <a href=""http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/forum.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/forum.php</a>",1312829055

Definitely, it helped refine my grammar and composition skills.<p>But the creative writing courses really provided a lot of other valuable experience too.  Having to put together a creative work involves parts of my brain I never really used while coding -- it was sort of a challenge to put aside the methodical, linear path I live in while programming and have to imagine a world, then put someone in it, and have them do things that people might want to know about.<p>The other nice thing about workshop-based writing courses is that you generally read and comment on works written by your fellow students.  You learn new craft skills from reading their work for sure, but you also learn how to give constructive criticism where it needs to be given.<p>This sort of diplomacy is something you need to practice in order to be good at it.  It will help you later when you're in a code review meeting at work and you are the guy who can step up and say something more useful than ""you're doing it all wrong, that code sucks, and so do you.""",1312829031

Gestures work just fine, as long as you do them on the screen itself and make them tightly correspond to real-world behavior. The usability problem occurs when the display and the touch interface are decoupled. The intuitive aspect of direct manipulation hinges on the manipulation actually being direct.<p>The trouble with mice is that they are a double proxy. You move the mouse in absolute terms, the mouse moves relative to a surface, and that relative movement is translated to the screen. The mind after a while abstracts away the mouse into a piece of your hand, so touchpads aren't really an improvement over mice, because you're just making relative movements on a proxied surface in both cases. In my experience the big usability issue with touchpads vs mice is that the area for relative movement is too small, requiring frequent repositioning. Apple gets it right by making the touchpad surface huge, so that you reposition your fingers less.<p>I expect that the current form factor is just an in-between until most computing devices look like ipads with external keyboards, with the mouse reserved for precision work (or perhaps we'll have dual finger/pen touchscreens).",1312828861

If you feel its missing 4g, send your impl to the team and it will be open sourced with everything else, if you feel it's missing stylus support, send that too. Etc. This way any phone supporting the hardware reqs will be able to take advantage of it.<p>Instead HTC is taking many many months to port their POS software to the new Android version.

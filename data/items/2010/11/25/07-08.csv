So they have the context, they may just want a refresher later.  Or maybe they saw something on a slide they couldn't make out before you advanced.<p>Besides, what do you care?  What's the real reason you're refusing?<p>Here's the logical extension of the suggested alternative: don't bother to give a talk.  Just send copies of your papers.<p>But that sounds silly to me.  I think there's probably a reason people both give talks and write papers.  So here's my suggestion: if your slides aren't worth giving out, don't show them when you speak.",1290669320

If the first paragraph I quoted had been standalone, or better as a short comment, I would have been in full approval.<p>Anyway, I appreciate your response.  It's good try to appreciate what others see that I do not.  Yes, if you ignore the details of the code and the explanations, there are some good parts.  If you look _only_ at the big picture, it's probably a fine book.  And I love his clearly prefixed naming conventions.   But I think you'd do a lot better reading something like the SQLite source code rather than this book if you want to see examples of good C.<p>I guess I have to ask:  do you feel that chapter 4 on using  setjmp() and longjmp() plus some brittle macros for error handling is also good for learners?

8375918,comment,8374810,8375760,11,0,tryp,,,"I totally agree about micros. They are wonderfully nice and tidy for small, well defined problems. I&#x27;ve had extremely satisfying success using them for communications glue, motor controllers and thermoelectric cooler controllers.<p>I&#x27;m in a chatty mood tonight, so I hope you&#x27;ll excuse my indulgence of another few &#x27;graphs on modern memory bus stuff I think is cool that I had to learn under product ship-date duress: Dynamic Termination.<p>Remember the high-school physics demonstration of the &quot;reflected wave&quot; where you grab one end of a rope that&#x27;s tied off at the other end, give it a flick, watch the wave travel from your hand to the knot, then reflect back? Well kind of the same thing happens with voltage level on high speed data signals.<p>If your high school was fortunate enough in these (or those) fiscally troubled times to afford the equipment, the next demonstration tied off the same rope to some sort of damping spring that absorbed your wave&#x27;s energy and didn&#x27;t reflect it back at you. Those springs translate to &quot;termination impedance&quot; in electrical circuits.<p>So in order to avoid reflections, the address/control/clock lines of the memory bus &quot;fly by&quot; each and every DRAM IC until they reach the end of their path, where they &quot;terminate&quot; via resistors that prevent reflection to a voltage potential (half-way between 1- or 0- value potentials so that it&#x27;s no more work to drive a 1 that 0 or vice-versa).<p>The data lines are wired directly from the memory controller to the DRAM chips so the DRAM chips have termination built-in to absorb the energy at the end of the line and prevent reflections.<p>Except that maybe there&#x27;s more than one DIMM. DDR3 chips let you command them to connect or disconnect their termination resistors. So when you are accessing the closer-to-the-controller DIMM, the next one that&#x27;s further out can apply termination. And when addressing the one that&#x27;s furthest out, you disable on-die termination and rely on the actual resistor on the motherboard at the end of the bus.<p>My hard-learned lesson: the signals don&#x27;t so so well when you get confused about which rank of chips are closer and which are further away.",1411786651
8375917,comment,8374345,8374345,2,0,darylteo,,,"Seems like everyone misreading the intent of the post. He is NOT advocating inlining code in this post. He is suggesting that FP is better at solving the same problems in a more sensible way.<p>The email was written in 2007. In there, he advocates the inlining of single-use functions into god functions as it reduces the risk of these functions being opted into other routines, especially when they all deal with shared mutable data.<p>Single-use functions are explicitly singled out in his email; he mentions that he does not encourage duplicating code to avoid functions.<p>| &quot;In almost all cases, code duplication is a greater evil than whatever second order problems arise from functions being called in different circumstances, so I would rarely advocate duplicating code to avoid a function&quot;<p>The blurb at the front indicates the intent of his post. Since then he has favoured a functional-programming approach - don&#x27;t inline your functions, but avoid making your functions rely on mutable/larger scope states. Pass in everything that is needed by the function through parameters. Avoid functions with side-effects, encourage idempotence. That way, reusing the function does not lead to unintentional side-effects.<p>He also mentions that should you still decide to inline, &quot; you should be made constantly aware of the full horror of what you are doing.&quot;.<p>A lot of things change within a decade. =)",1411786611

8375910,comment,8374345,8374780,6,0,ANTSANTS,,,">Blasphemous as it may seem, a switch statement does the equivalent of simple polymorphism and can be kept inline.<p>In the statically compiled languages that most people think of when they hear &quot;OO&quot; (C++ and Java), yeah, switch statements vs. virtual methods (performance differences aside) is basically a matter of code style (do you want to organize by function/method, or by type/object?)<p>However, the original proponents of OO intended it to be used in dynamically compiled languages where it could be used as a way to implement open/extensible systems. For instance, if a game entity has true update, animate, etc. methods, then anyone can implement new entities at run time; level designers can create one-off entities for certain levels, modders can pervasively modify behaviors without needing the full source code, programmers trying to debug some code can easily update methods while the game is still running, etc. You can get a similar effect in C or C++ with dynamic linking (Quake 2 did this for some large subsystems), but it&#x27;s a pain and kinda breaks down at fine (entity-level) granularity.<p>The other, &quot;dual&quot; (I think I&#x27;m using that word correctly?) approach famously used by emacs is to create hooks that users can register their own functions with, and extend the program that way. Like switch statements, it basically amounts to storing functions at the call site instead of inside the object, except with an extensible data structure rather than burning everything directly into the machine code.<p>Obviously you can&#x27;t really take advantage of any of this if you&#x27;re writing some state of the art hyper-optimized rendering code or whatever like Carmack, I&#x27;m just saying that OO&#x27;s defining characteristics make a lot more sense when you drift away from C++ back to its early days at Xerox PARC.",1411786337

Outside of various performance issues, the idea that you can have one master model of your problem to solve everything is an idea that hopefully seems to be running out of steam.<p>In the area I&#x27;ve worked in, I&#x27;ve seen numerous semantic systems come and go, all built around essentially one giant model of the slice of the world it&#x27;s supposed to represent, and the projects all end up dead after a couple years because:<p>a) the model does a poor job representing the world<p>b) nobody seems to have a use-case that lines up perfectly with the model (everybody needs some slightly different version of the model to work with)<p>c) attempts to rectify b by just adding in more and more to the model just leaves you with an unusable messy model.<p>More recent systems seems to be working at a meta-model level, with fewer abstract concepts and links, rather than getting down into the weeds with such specificity, and letting people muck around in the details as they see fit. But lots of the aggregate knowledge that large-scale semantic systems are supposed to offer gets lost in this kind of approach.<p>I think OOP at its heart is just another case of this -- it&#x27;s managed to turn a programming problem into an ontology problem. You can define great models for your software that mostly make sense, but then the promise of code-reuse means your suddenly trying to shoehorn in a model meant for a different purpose into this new project. The result is code that either tries to ignore &quot;good&quot; OOP practices to just get the damn job done, or over specified models that end up so complicated nobody can really work with them and introduce unbelievable organizational and software overhead.<p>It&#x27;s not to say that OOP and other semantic modeling approach don&#x27;t have merit. They&#x27;re very useful tools. I think the answer might be separate models on the same problem/data, each representing a facet on the problem. But I haven&#x27;t quite gotten the impression that anybody else has arrived at this in industry and are instead just going for higher levels of abstraction or dumping the models all together.<p>Again, OOP manages to turn programming problems into ontology problems -- which is hardly a field that&#x27;s well understood, while the goal is and always has been to turn programming problems into engineering problems -- which are much more readily understood.",1411784904

This test is a bastardization of the three point bending test that is commonly performed for peak bending strength analysis of materials.<p>Bending is a result of moments and moments are driven by moment arms.  These tests should not be looking at point load required to induce deformation but rather the moment required to induce deformation.  Each of these should have been converted into equivalent moments based on the size of the phone.<p>For example, the M8 is shown as 146.3 mm (5.76 in) H; 70.6 mm (2.78 in) W; 9.4 mm (0.37 in) D and the iPhone 6 is 138.1 x 67 x 6.9 mm (5.44 x 2.64 x 0.27 in) and both are shown to &quot;deform&quot; at 70 lbs.<p>The M8 has an induced moment of 100 lb-in while the iPhone 6 has an induced moment of 95 lb-in.  The resultant bending stress by assuming a linear stress distribution across the section is then 1575 psi for the M8 and 2950 psi for the iPhone 6.<p>Similar analyses should be undertaken for each of the other phones.<p>A more accurate test for the failure mode of concern would be a four point load test in which moment is constant across a portion of the phone.  The three point load test induces a moment that is maximum at the point of load application.  The four point load test is more likely to show you where the point of weakness in the phone is.",1411784451

For these kind of high-touch clients, speaking/moderating at conferences is the best way we&#x27;ve found to source new deal flow, investors (our customers), and potential channel partners outside of having major media coverage. Our deal team gets crushed when I return from a run of back-to-back conferences. I could imagine it would be the same thing for enterprise sales and healthcare IT.<p>In cases like ours, if you can speak/moderate at a conference you have the social proof to pitch to your customers horizontally rather than pitching up. Moreover, once you get one or two speaking/moderating gigs under your belt it&#x27;s really easy to get more (Point to previous track record) as conference organizers are typically sourcing speakers/moderators from previous conferences. I also watch for new conferences like a hawk, and fire off emails offering to speak/moderate for anything that looks like it will have our audience. And the best thing about it is that you won&#x27;t have to pay.

When I do end up refactoring, it&#x27;s often hard to switch to a functional style. There are complex dependencies between the different &quot;minor&quot; functions, and the easiest route forward seems to be to replace the function with a class: minor functions become methods, and the function-level local variables become instance variables, etc.  Also, this is a small issue, but how do you deal with minor functions that &quot;return&quot; variables?

The programmer&#x27;s understanding and expectation of what the function does isn&#x27;t in that it affects state in a way the programmer didn&#x27;t know or expect. What the function does becomes much more obvious and controllable when you inline the function&#x27;s body.",1411783452

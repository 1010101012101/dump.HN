10881063,comment,10880694,10880694,0,0,tokenadult,,,"It&#x27;s useful in this context, after reading the BBC story kindly submitted here, to go to a webpage by a biology professor, Jerry Coyne, who literally wrote the book on speciation and definitions of species.[1] He wrote, in his webpage follow-up to a professional lecture for other biologists,[2]<p>&quot;But I want to discuss briefly a shorter second piece by Gibbons in the same issue of Science, &#x27;The species problem.&#x27; Here she brings up the controversy about whether modern humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans were members of different species or the same species. This question is far more important in dealing with humans than, say, with fruit flies, simply because there were far fewer types of hominins, and anthropologists’ careers depend on whether or not they name a new species. That’s why there are so many species names in the hominin family tree—names that turn on characters as tiny as a few millimeters in the measurement of a tooth.  It’s likely that, several million years ago, three or four species of hominin did exist at the same time—and maybe at the same place—giving rise to fanciful scenarios about war and (especially) inter-group mating. . . .<p>&quot;But that was more than a million years ago.  What about the more modern groups of <i>Homo</i>, like Neandertals? According to Ernst Mayr’s biological species concept, which Gibbons describes, individuals are members of the same species if they can mate with each other when they encounter each other in nature, and, critically, produce fertile, viable hybrids. If they can’t, then there must exist genetic barriers to mixing of genes, the so-called &#x27;reproductive isolating barriers&#x27; that maintain the integrity of species.&quot;<p>With that issue clarified, we see that anthropologists who find bones in the ground will always have incentive to be &quot;splitters,&quot; identifying more rather than fewer species, and the only way to resolve how many species there were is to figure out which ancient hominids could mate and produce viable offspring who in turn could mate again and again produce viable offspring for more generations.<p>Studies of ancient DNA used to be impossible. It was a big breakthrough the first time an Egyptian mummy (plainly a modern human) had its DNA sequenced. The DNA sequencing of a Neanderthal[3] was a further breakthrough. It&#x27;s plain now that Neanderthals and &quot;modern humans&quot; were part of the same biological species. The usual reckoning is that any modern human with traceable ancestry to Europe or to Asia probably has genes and gene combinations characteristic of Neanderthals, which have since spread further all over the world.<p>We are all closely related, and we are related to a great variety of ancient human fossil samples. Where human artifacts and cultural ideas travel, human genes travel, and we are all much more &quot;mixed&quot; and interrelated than people imagined even a decade ago.[4]<p>[1] <i>Speciation</i> by Jerry A.

10881056,comment,10880652,10880953,0,0,vidarh,,,"I like approaches like this too. Largely because it tends to make you think about <i>why</i> you need consistency, more durability, better query abilities etc. for specific subsets of the data if/when it comes up, and what the specific requirements are.<p>When people throw everything into a database, in my experience the specific requirements for specific subsets of the data are often lost in the fog of history as people often don&#x27;t document <i>why</i> they need to be in the database.<p>Then it turns out the database is used for everything from a short term cache which could just as well have been in memory, to logs which are of limited utility over long term and &quot;just&quot; need to be indexed for short term querying, to vital financial transactional data which needs to be kept for X number of years, to per-user data which is never, ever looked up other than when that specific user is logged in, and so would be ideal to shard, and so on.<p>Grabbing for the RDBMS right away is then the lazy way out where you can often get away with not seriously evaluating what is best, because it is &quot;good enough&quot;. Then it&#x27;s nice to start out with something that is sufficiently limited that you&#x27;re forced to take it into consideration sooner rather than later.",1452524282

The higher-up has the same incentive before his higher-up.<p>If you fall from grace with your higher-up (by not being able to achieve the numbers planned by the party), then your career is over (and possibly that of your family and business partners too).\nSo you <i>have to</i> give him those numbers. If you do, he will take care of you and with time, you will grow.<p>Then there&#x27;s another property of communism: people steal.<p>Not only you have to report higher productivity than the set goal, you also have to cover up for all the stealing that took place below you and the &quot;favors&quot; you make to the higher-ups.<p>Of course this is illegal, but when people start doing this, they become partners in crime and now it&#x27;s about life an death.\nFalling from grace can actually mean doing hard time in jail or even getting the capital punishment.<p>This system works well when the economy grows - the pressure to perform beyond expectations is increased with each layer of bureaucracy and is more than just about &quot;job security&quot; - it&#x27;s about survival - so people <i>have to</i> produce those numbers.. even if it means lying.<p>Of course the hard work is done by the same oppressed &quot;working class&quot; that the system was supposed to help in the first place.<p>Now, I have <i>no idea</i> what&#x27;s going on in China and if these properties apply to their particular flavor of communism, but I suspect they do, because this is how human  beings have to behave in that game to win.<p>And that means that the numbers reported by the government are probably off by quite a bit and it&#x27;s possible that even they have no idea what the real situation is.",1452523067

In other words, Torque lets you access and manipulate data in a relational database using java objects. Unlike most other object-relational mappers, Torque does not use reflection to access user-provided classes, but it generates the necessary classes (including the Data Objects) from an XML schema describing the database layout. The XML file can either be written by hand or a starting point can be generated from an existing database. The XML schema can also be used to generate and execute a SQL script which creates all the tables in the database.<p>As Torque hides database-specific implementation details, Torque makes an application independent of a specific database if no exotic features of the database are used.<p>Usage of code generation eases the customization of the database layer, as you can override the generated methods and thus easily change their behavior. A modularized template structure allows inclusion of your own code generation templates during the code generation process.",1452522923

The guide is long, but worthwhile if you&#x27;re going to be in this situation.<p>The employer-employee relationship is generally relatively straightforward if you&#x27;re being paid in regular income/on contract: It&#x27;s easy to put a value on what you&#x27;re being paid because that is part of the contract. When you&#x27;re being granted equity, things get complicated because now you have an ownership interest or something that&#x27;s economically similar to this.<p>In order to value this, you have to understand the capital structure and corporate structure of your company. This can get complex, as the guide shows.<p>Of course, even if you fully understand these principles, the value of your equity stake may not be certain because the value of your company is not certain; but it will help you answer the question: <i>How much will my equity stake be worth if my company is sold for X dollars?</i><p>If you don&#x27;t fully understand how your equity value ties to the company&#x27;s value, you could end up like the employees of Good Technology:<p><a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-12-23/good-technology-wasn-t-so-good-for-employees"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-12-23/good-techno...</a>",1452522390

98834,comment,98244,98244,0,0,viergroupie,,,"It's pretty well established in the psychology literature that the effects of money on happiness are relative. You're happy (for some short time) if you make more than you expected, and you're (often) happy if you make more than your peers. Absolute quantity of money doesn't really do much for us humans, and I think the ""irrational"" test subjects were aware of that.",1200430709

98831,comment,98768,98805,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"Yes, it's portable, but I'm kinda curious about how it would be to work with it over long periods of time.  Considering how thin it is, I would think that there would be a pretty serious learning curve when it comes to typing.  If, in fact, the keyboard is implemented so that you don't feel like you're typing on the tabletop, this will probably be a winner due to the weight savings.  I could care less if they make it any smaller, if the regular MacBook only weighed a couple pounds, I would probably own one right now.",1200429911

Lots of people fantasize about these things.<p>I used to have two 24"" monitors with a pansy dell laptop to power them.<p>Now I have just a 17"" MacBookPro. It's excellent, but I could use more pixels.<p>The ideal setup would be a MacPro with 2 30"" screens, with something like MacBook Air setup to mirror my configuration.<p>It would be docked like my iPhone, auto-install software that I install on the desktop, auto-configure to match the relevant system settings, auto-update the local repository that I'm developing, etc.<p>Any time, when you need portability, you could take the Air.<p>I'm sure a simple script could get most of this done on a local wireless network. Too bad I don't have $13K to spend on it ... yet.",1200428849

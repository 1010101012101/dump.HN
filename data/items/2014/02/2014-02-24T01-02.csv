When the relationship gets bigger or needs to serve a large portion of our base, we typically either peer with that provider (in the case of big cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, etc) or establish dedicated connectivity between our networks.<p>I think Comcast, Verizon, TWC, etc has a point here -- as a relationship grows with another party, you should have a more robust connection. Netflix hasn&#x27;t wanted to do that -- it prefers to use a shitty ISP (Cogent) for cheap, and augment it by co-locating content on end-user ISP networks for free. Services like Netflix and Youtube stretch the net-neutrality argument, because they aren&#x27;t good citizens.<p>That said, the end-user ISPs cannot be allowed to discriminate, which their monopoly power will almost certainly enable them to do.",1393207134

Here&#x27;s an intro &quot;crib sheet&quot;<p>Your application believes that it has all the RAM to itself. This is a lie that the operating system and hardware tell your application to decouple the physical RAM addresses and the ones your application uses (virtual RAM addresses). Learn more about virtual memory here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory</a><p>In order to keep this mirage working, the computer needs to map from virtual address to physical address.  Instead of tracking every single address, it tracks  spans of addresses.  So, the address your application sees as 0 to 4096 will map to physical address 5000 to 9096. Keeping this map using fixed-size spans keeps the size of the mapping down and the performance fast.<p>This article is about using bigger spans (0 to about 1 billion) instead of the standard 4kb.  The advantage of this is that the mapping from virtual to physical is stored in memory as a tree and bigger spans mean you need fewer nodes in the tree. Fewer nodes means you have less traversals/indirection to find the node you are looking for. Less work means faster performance.<p>The details about the caching and the counts of TLB in the processor has to do with how much dedicated space is in different parts of the CPU for this mapping information.<p>The details about offsets and changing how the memory was accessed in order get positive / negative performance in the tradeoff of 4kb vs 1gb have to do with wether the mapping information was in the cache or not. it is similar to alignment: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment</a><p>A lot of the obscure parts of the code are just how the author is calculating addresses to read using pointer arithmatic <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)#C_and_C.2B.2B"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)#...</a> and bit-shifting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation</a><p>Finally, in order to use these 1gb maps instead of 4kb maps, the programmer has to leverage special way of allocating memory from the operating system called mmap <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap</a>",1393206668

Half of the &quot;tech&quot; in the HTTP/1.X spec is to allow for caching of resources and responses by proxies, allowing anyone between the client and server (e.g. your ISP) to act as a CDN.<p>HTTPS/1.X effectively throws that away by doing end-to-end encryption. It&#x27;s a trade-off: we gain the surety that all the responses are coming directly from the peer, rather than anyone else... but the web becomes 90% less cacheable, because the only places things can end up cached are between the client and the HTTPS pipe (i.e. the browser cache), or between the HTTPS pipe and the server (i.e. &quot;reverse proxies&quot; like Nginx.)<p>The current workaround for this, when you <i>need</i> caching for your Big Traffic on either ingress or egress, is to do what amounts to purposeful self-MITMing of your HTTPS session: to terminate HTTPS <i>on a caching proxy</i>, that holds the certificate of your client/server, and acts as if it were you, while itself doing another HTTPS session for &quot;the last mile&quot; to connect to you. This is what companies do when they deploy their own CA-cert to their networks, so everyone&#x27;s access can be proxied through their own system; and this is what services like Cloudflare do when they sit &quot;in front of&quot; your server while not being a part of your company&#x27;s VPN at all.<p>Basically, HTTP2 codifies this workaround, and calls it HTTP.",1393206350

This rejection at best speaks to inadequacy of the interview processes.<p>>> “The best founders are relatively young.” The WhatsApp founders were in their mid to late thirties.<p>Let&#x27;s say there is a probability distribution relating startup success with the age of the founders.  You sample this distribution a very large number of times and find that for a very rare event, the founders are in mid to late thirties.  Can you really draw any significant conclusions about the shape of this probability distribution from it?<p>>> “The center of gravity for consumer products has moved north from the Valley to San Francisco.” Well, that’s largely true, but WhatsApp remained headquartered deep in Silicon Valley.<p>I would assume that WhatsApp&#x27;s location was not a criteria for the acquisition given that the locations considered here are relatively close by.  Surely there would be correlations between a startup success and location within Silicon Valley based on talent pool available, startup atmosphere, etc., but again, the estimated probability distributions would not see a significant change from the new knowledge of this event.<p>>> “Mobile products should be delightful, beautiful.” ... apps should look nice, but at minimum, they should work to solve some problem ...<p>I wonder if the conclusion really needs this specific event to be seen as generally valid.  It is quite obvious that the app should solve some problem, most probably even if it is a beauty product.<p>>> “Don’t worry about making money, just grow big.”<p>This one was an eye-opener for me given the scale of this acquisition, under the assumptions that this high a valuation was sensible and that this event is not actually astronomically rare.\nFounders and VCs always ask themselves questions on how to monetize.  Unless we are in an acquisition bubble, the relevance of this question partly comes under question.",1393205956

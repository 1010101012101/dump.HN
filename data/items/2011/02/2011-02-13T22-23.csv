In fact I used to communicate with others on a regular basis but that ceased awhile ago.

2214278,comment,2213208,2213403,0,0,philwelch,,,"By definition, the position that there are significant differences between different races is racism. Likewise, Sailer appears to be a racist and VDARE appears to be a racist web site. I don't know where either Sailer or VDARE has ever expressed actual outright <i>hatred</i>, per se, but ""hate group"" seems to be one of those non-literal political buzzwords nowadays. I think it would be better if everyone were to speak plainly and literally rather than using ill-fitting political cliches. (See: Orwell, ""Politics and the English Language"": <a href=""http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm</a>)<p>I hope all people everywhere know better than to accept anyone's conclusions without serious corroboration or fact-checking. Yes, Sailer's conclusions are racist--but the question is whether they're <i>true</i> or not. And if you're willing to stop short at identifying them as racist without even asking that question, perhaps Sailer isn't the only one with a clear, ideological bias.<p>Ideological biases usually manifest themselves as flawed arguments that some conclusion or other is true. This is the type of bias you accuse Sailer of; I think your accusation is perfectly reasonable. Sometimes, though, ideological biases manifest themselves as social taboos.

To say tobacco has nothing to do with controlled substances is objectively false.<p><i>I won't even address the assertion that ""addiction has nothing to do with the molecule"". Since a drug consists entirely of molecules, your claim doesn't make semantic sense.</i><p>I'll address this for you. When people refer to something as addictive, they either mean a psychologically habit forming activity (psychological addiction) or a substance that causes withdrawal symptoms when the body abruptly stops receiving it (physical addiction).<p>Most of US drug policy, in particular the Controlled Substances Act, is designed to curb the abuse of recreational drugs. Does this sound like its addressing psychological addiction or physical addiction? Keep in mind that not only tobacco, but also alcohol, the <i>only recreational drug those withdrawal symptoms are lethal</i>, are deferred to other policies in the Controlled Substances Act.<p>So clearly, the statement ""addiction has nothing to do with the molecule"" is referring to psychological addiction. You assert this statement is false. You are saying that psychological addiction is directly related to the composition of the elements used in the addictive activity. To be consistent with this logic, you must also reject the following claims:<p>""gambling addiction has nothing to do with decks of playing cards""<p>""video game addiction has nothing to do with executable code""<p>""sex addiction has nothing to do with penises or vaginas""<p>Surely you <i>must</i> realize that the majority of people who try physically addictive substances do not end up addicted.

That is good because you know nobody's going to suddenly dump 21 million more bitcoins in circulation, and halve the value of your coinage.<p>That's what's happening with USD. They keep dumping trillions of new dollars in the money supply, something I really wouldn't like if I had dollars in my bank account. Just ask Zimbabwe, where they need a cartwheel of money to buy dinner at a restaurant.<p>So what if demand keeps growing and we need more than 21 million coins?

You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode's office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?'' He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, ``You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.'' I simply slunk out of the office!</i><p>> <i>What Bode was saying was this: ``Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.'' Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don't want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode's remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don't like to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.

It's more of a scare tactic than something tangible and certainly not very enforceable (at least in California) and most people wouldn't find it worthwhile to do so. That said, there is less and less value in an NDA among several different parties, depending who you talk to.<p>The correct answer should be, assuming you already have your company entity formed, is to get an attorney to draft up what is called a Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement. This agreement basically states that any and all work done for the company belongs to the company. The draft is different for employees vs contractors but can be made for each type of person you are hiring. In it, you can detail what exactly is being done to avoid it being stolen (IP and all). It basically has a built in NDA but goes further in length to protect what you need.<p>I do agree execution is where its all at but don't worry too much about your idea getting stolen. If it's easily ripped and you can't defend it better than the people who steal it from you, you got bigger problems. I find that sharing ideas to the public are often better than hiding them. I can't keep count of the number of people and number of times I've received valuable feedback, resources, etc... for sharing what I'm working on with random people I've met at networking events, etc... only to gain more insight than before. Learn to let go of the fear of sharing what you're doing to some degree. Only some things are worth keeping private. The general premise of the idea however, is not one of those things and you certainly don't need to map everything out to your developer you are hiring up front to get them to build a prototype.<p>As for abroad, you might as well forget it. International legal battles are fruitless unless you're talking about monumental amount of money involved and high power. Chances are, you're definitely neither of those and you're not going to be suing someone overseas. If you're that worried about your idea being stolen, you got bigger issues than it actually happening.",1297636292

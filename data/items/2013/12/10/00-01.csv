In general you shouldn&#x27;t hire people until the company is already successful, i.e. people want what you&#x27;re building faster than you can build it.  If you do, you introduce a whole lot of other problems (having to pay them, having to convince them to pivot when you realize you&#x27;re not succeeding, having to communicate the new company vision to them, having to keep them from getting disenchanted and bringing morale down) that you wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with if you just didn&#x27;t hire them in the first place.<p>I&#x27;ve found the biggest cause of failure of software projects (in general, not just startups) is staffing up too quickly.

If I want to open an image, I use an image viewer - or increasingly, a web browser.<p>A text editor for programming is different. It swims best in a sea of programmable components that can be recombined endlessly. Elisp is one part of that; the shell is another.<p>I&#x27;ve increasingly isolated my dependency on OSes down to two things, the web browser and the terminal window, both because those are the two things that are consistent and available across all platforms I use - from production servers down to my phone - and because they&#x27;re the best platforms for what I do.<p>I know UIs will improve over the next 20 years as they have over the past 20 years. But I also know that I spent a good 18 of the past years using one GUI IDE and editor after the next, and had little compounded return on each iterated investment. Meanwhile, the parallel investment I made in the terminal and the shell has paid off handsomely. I&#x27;m no longer pissed off at the crap Apple and MS pull with their OSes, because I&#x27;m no longer dependent on them. I spend more and more time in the terminal. Using a world-class editor in the terminal is just another extension of that.<p>Another thing. I transitioned to using Linux on the desktop fulltime at work last February. That transition would have been much more painful if I hadn&#x27;t lived inside Cygwin on Windows since 1998 or so. If I had to live with the horrific car crash that is X userland, I doubt I could have lasted as long as I have. I want to have little to do with X as possible. It&#x27;s a colossal pile of crap. Every app beyond a web browser and terminal emulator is an app too many.",1386637132

Taking MOOC classes and reading textbooks is a great way to learn, but they tend to focus on a lot on the mathematical principle and not the start-from-nothing practical considerations.<p>Machine learning is almost like learning chess in that there are certain obvious mistakes that noobs continue to make. And like chess there are multiple levels of thinking and understanding that are almost impossible to teach to someone that doesn&#x27;t have lots of experience. Hopefully more blog posts like this will help people get past the novice level.<p>Regarding technical content:<p>N-fold Cross validation [1] can be a more effective approach to having a single held out or validation set. You split your data into N groups, say N = 10. Then you use groups 2-10 as a training set to make predictions on group 1, then groups 1,3-10 to make predictions on group 2, etc. Recombine the prediction output files and use the measured error to tune and tweak your predictor. It&#x27;s more work and can still lead to overfitting, but it&#x27;s generally better to overfit the entire training set than it is to overfit one held out sample.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_%28statistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_%28statistics%...</a>",1386636759

6878241,comment,6875942,6877980,2,0,contingencies,,,"Right. The move to create specific legislation around Bitcoin could be construed as a move to denature the present Bitcoin economy and pull it closer to conventional financial regulation. This seems ultimately pretty pointless from a government perspective, however, since the move will happen anyway and there are already popular alternatives that would remain unaffected. Essentially it could weight development investment towards Bitcoin instead of towards financial innovation in general. Such a strategy, if properly considered and so motivated, would be an act of resistance - stalling the inevitable - rather than one of any real efficacy. I think this is really just some people trying to get recognition for Bitcoin: the full story may only be available by speaking to them or reading German.<p>The potential significance of Switzerland in Bitcoin recognition this should be clarified. SIX Interbank Clearing, the organization that act as registrar for ISO4217-A3 currency codes (ie. codes like &#x27;USD&#x27;, &#x27;EUR&#x27;, etc.) on behalf of the ISO, and also SWIFT BIC codes (IIRC), is based in Switzerland. Jon Matonis from the Bitcoin Foundation approached them earlier this year about issuing an official XBT codepoint for Bitcoin, but they denied the request claiming that requests for codepoints much be made in writing from an existing national bank (subtext: from a UN-recognized country in that other ISO list).<p>My own proposal is to sidestep the ISO entirely and use IANA to register currencies or currency-like commodities as a means to achieve the unambiguous identification of such within multi-currency financial transfer systems, such as present era math based currency exchange businesses like my employer (Payward/Kraken). More details on that over here:\n<a href=\"http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/x-iso4217-a3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/x-iso4217-a3</a><p>Ultimately even if the Bitcoin Foundation doesn&#x27;t support such standardization (and it probably will; I literally have a draft in my inbox to Jon since Friday) I am fairly confident that the new self regulating industry body we have founded, DATA, will. <a href=\"http://info.datauthority.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://info.datauthority.org/</a><p>We live in interesting times, and the goal is clear. As Iain Coke, Head of Financial Services Faculty, Institute of Chartered Accountants (UK) said so eloquently in <i>The Telegraph</i> last year: <i>In order to regain trust in banking, what is needed is a real change in culture, embedding integrity and eradicating the &#x27;what can I get away with&#x27; attitude.</i>",1386636645

And this is just one of many &quot;forgotten&quot; operating systems with features that have been left behind.<p>Consider pervasive scripting of applications (yes, I know about Apple Script, but having spent 5 years in an office full of Mac users, I&#x27;ve yet to see anyone <i>use it</i>; on the Amiga AREXX was something almost everyone used in some form or another; and no, shell scripting is not comparable); consider componentized systems where users regularly install new components that enhance &quot;all&quot; their applications (e.g. need support for 7z? on the Amiga you&#x27;d install a new XPK library if you want to support a new compression algorithm, and all programs that want to compress data will support it; need support for an archival format? Install the right XAD library; want your paint program to read WebP? Install a suitable DataType library, and any application that knows how to use DataTypes to load images will be able to load it); consider if end users can replace dialog boxes or other GUI components wholesale in almost all their applications - AmigaOS has a few different alternatives: ARP, ASL and ReqTools that provide things like file-requesters. Because of the nature of AmigaOS, there were quickly apps that would act as shims from e.g. ASL to ReqTools, allowing users to pick and choose the file requester they want without relying on application developers choices.<p>We took giant steps back when Windows snuffed out most of the competition and with it a huge amount of innovative ideas that current mainstream computer users have never even experienced.<p>Even the stuff that made it into systems like AmigaOS and many others in the 80&#x27;s to early 90&#x27;s were mere shades of many of the visions coming out of the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, but the features in OS&#x27;s like AmigaOS, OS/2, BeOS and many others were <i>there</i> - many of them are <i>not</i> hard work, but a matter of culture and support for the ideas.",1386636412

It would help to distinguish the not extremely big companies. I’m not sure if this feature will be very usefully for the general public.<p>* In other graph, the axis doesn’t start at 0. I consider this a feature, but some people would claim that it’s misleading.

6878152,comment,6877511,6877511,2,0,actsasbuffoon,,,">  Not many languages manage to implement map in a way that [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;].map(parseInt) would result in [1, NaN, NaN]<p>It may seem counterintuitive at first, but it makes sense when you consider the function signatures. The map function passes two arguments; the element, and its index. The index ends up being used as the radix, which causes this sequence of calls:<p><pre><code>  parseInt(&quot;1&quot;, 0);\n  parseInt(&quot;2&quot;, 1);\n  parseInt(&quot;3&quot;, 2);\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d recommend creating a higher-order function that takes a function and returns a unary version:<p><pre><code>  function unary(fn) {\n    return function(arg) {\n      return fn(arg);\n    };\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThen you could use it like this:<p><pre><code>  [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;].map(unary(parseInt));\n  // => [1, 2, 3]\n</code></pre>\nI think the problem is that you assumed (not unreasonably) that [...].map(parseInt) was an eta reduction of [...].map(function(e) {return parseInt(e);}). Unfortunately it&#x27;s not, which caused some unexpected results. This would happen in any language where the map function passes two arguments and the string-to-integer function has an optional second argument.<p>Consider the following Ruby (this is a really weird way to do it in Ruby, but I&#x27;m trying to make the method signatures match):<p><pre><code>  # This lambda has the same type signature as JavaScript&#x27;s parseInt\n  parse_int = ->(str, radix = 10) { str.to_i radix }\n\n  # This converts the lambda to a block and calls it with each element\n  # from the array, along with its index.\n  %w[1 2 3].map.with_index &parse_int\n  # => ArgumentError: invalid radix 1\n</code></pre>\nAs an aside, I&#x27;m a recovering JavaScript hater as well. I&#x27;ve mostly made peace with JS, though there are still parts of the language that make my skin crawl (See this gist for my favorite example: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/actsasbuffoon/7323667\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/actsasbuffoon/7323667</a>).

There are indeed some wealthy people with low income, and high-income people with low wealth, but it isn&#x27;t the norm. See table 5 (pg. 36) in this whitepaper, which shows both net worth by income percentile, and income by net worth percentile: <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2009/200913/200913pap.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2009/200913/200913pa...</a><p>Example numbers: the top 1% of 2007 income-earners held 26% of U.S. wealth, and the top 1% of households by net worth in 2006 earned 16% of the year&#x27;s income. Meanwhile, the bottom 50% of income-earners held only 14% of U.S. wealth, and the bottom 50% by net worth earned only 22% of U.S. income. The general trend holds in the in-between categories as well: the 95-99th percentile of incomes hold about twice as much wealth as the 90-95th percentile, etc.<p>So the relationship is not perfect, but taking the groups in aggregate, higher-income-earners control considerably more wealth than lower-income-earners. Some of the later figures in the document explicitly plot some ratios.<p>Progressive taxation also has relatively little impact here. If you converted the income tax to an implied wealth tax (i.e. take tax paid in a year divided by wealth held at that time), U.S. income taxes are in aggregate roughly equivalent to a flat tax on wealth.",1386635295

I would say for bulk throughput oriented transfer from disk to socket via sendfile(), I&#x27;d say the costs of using Java are not noticeable at all.<p>Re: Google. MapReduce paper was published in 2004, only a few years after Java 1.4 was released. The infrastructure it is built on top of -- and like M/R itself -- were most certainly written before Java 1.4 was released and likely at a time where running Java on Linux meant using Blackdown -- which had its own issues. Java 1.4 is when java.util.concurrent and non-blocking I/O were introduced; prior to this, writing scalable socket in Java was far more difficult. It would also be until Java 1.6 that epoll() would be supported by Java on Linux, etc...<p>The other big part is that Map/Reduce is not in a vacuum: while Map/Reduce workloads are mostly I/O dominated, other pieces of infrastructure built on those working blocks are very memory intensive. Google &quot;Java GC&quot; to why that is still an issue with Java (despite having an extremely advanced concurrent garbage collector) In addition, I&#x27;d machine in the case of Google the performance advantages of C++ (more about things like being able to lay memory out in precise ways and being friendly to the CPU caches, rather than about pure performance) really do matter -- as Joshua Bloch put it &quot;inner loops of indexers would likely stay in C++&quot;.<p>Finally Google does have at least some infrastructural pieces that in Java: I do know that there are first-class supported APIs for BigTable/Spanner and Map/Reduce in Java, there is also the FlumeJava paper (an EDSL for Map/Reduce in Java), and while I believe C++ infrastructure has superseded MegaStore it is one piece of Java being used for Google&#x27;s core infrastructure.<p>That&#x27;s not to even mention Google&#x27;s well known exteandnsive use of Java for web-applications/middle-ware including AdSense/AdWords billing and management and gmail.<p>In the end, you can certainly write I/O intensive applications with Java, but with some caveats: be sure it&#x27;s actually I/O intensive and the non-I/O intensive parts perform fine in Java, be wary of GC hell, know how to avoid excess/implicit copying (pretty much a case in any languages), and be sure that the APIs you plan to use are available.<p>In the end, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an either/or answer: given (hate to use a buzzword, but it certainly applies) service oriented architecture, you can implement various pieces of a system in languages best suited for that task.

That&#x27;s the advantage of having a standard.<p>I personally find this entire thread extremely interesting, and enjo&#x27;s comment gets to the heart of it.  <Reader alert - I work for SIF><p>Now here&#x27;s my source of confusion.  We are an non-profit standards organization with an open standard (written and approved by our members) that can be used without cost by all K-12 end users and vendors (members or not), and with no IP agreement to sign.  True there is an optional product certification program, but that involves only a nominal fee to cover our costs.  The SIF Certification program was created to support our end users who often demand products undergo SIF certification to ensure they will seamlessly interoperate (ideally out of the box - but there are a LOT of reasons including optional data elements, why things are often not that simple).  The Clever folks know what I’m talking about ... or they will soon.<p>In earlier SIF releases, when the infrastructure was basically home grown, several integrators wrote what we call “agents” which allowed vendors (including vendors of SIS, Library, Transportation and more recently Assessment  and LMS related systems) to essentially enable their applications run in SIF interoperability Zones without changing a line of code.  For example some agents use internal application database triggers to detect data changes the application publishes.  There are several free open source SIF Agent toolkits available today for SIF 2 and we expect the same for SIF 3 where the fact that the infrastructure is now based on REST will make things a lot easier.<p>So we finally reach my question. Some very smart people have invested $10 million dollars in Clever, but the stated business model seems (in SIF terms) to be to:<p>•\tCreate and establish an API to retrieve data from SIS applications and<p>•\tSell SIS vendors the agent software to allow them to utilize that API.<p>If that’s essentially correct (and if not, I would ask a Clever representative to correct me) than given our own experiences I just don’t understand how such a strategy can be effectively monetized to provide an acceptable return on such a large initial investment.

Now that will be much higher for some people, particularly lots of people on the higher end of the income scale (doctors, surgeons, etc), but if we are talking about the 30-60+ age bracket then their school debt straight out of school will likely be lower than you could expect for the same school/program today.<p>What I am getting at is that I doubt student loans are a significant consideration for most people in the age ranges the article is talking about (from what I understand they are for doctors).<p>Also, most young people in the SF/tech scene sort of deal are likely looking at the typical school debt (~30k), but are looking at the low range of these salaries (100k+) starting at a much younger age.  I know people that are obliterating their student loans with the starting bonuses from their first jobs out of college.  <i>(That&#x27;s what I did, albeit several years ago, and only 5 years worth of tuition.)</i><p>These sort of scenarios won&#x27;t get you &quot;country-club rich&quot;, but will certainly get you into the elusive &quot;traditional middle-class security&quot; range.  The kind of wealthy where you can tell your kid they can go to any college accepts them, can take your whole family on 1-2 week long holidays every year as a tradition, buy your kids a shitty car when they turn 16, etc.  It is this sort of wealth that can prove troublesome politically.  People in this range are relatively isolated from true hardship; they don&#x27;t have to worry about making rent or worry about how to feed their family.  They are much more susceptible to pseudo-concerns like <i>&quot;is my corporate chain coffee fair trade&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;what if I become properly rich, then get taxed a lot?&quot;</i>.<p>Remember that HN is an echo chamber.  While we can talk about 250k and pretend like it is normal, the median household income is in the general neighborhood of 50k.  Most Americans will never see this sort of income.  For most Americans, 250k <i>is</i> wealth.<p>I think we have the tendency to define <i>&quot;wealth&quot;</i> as <i>&quot;something that is beyond our grasp&quot;</i>.

Google and Facebook have a problem that their offices are in FUCKING BORING monoculture suburbs which young, smart, energetic people do not typically want to live in.

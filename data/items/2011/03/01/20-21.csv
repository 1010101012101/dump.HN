2277173,comment,2274926,2276684,0,0,jokermatt999,,,"I think the reason to the strong reaction against the term ""potential lost sale"" is because this is often used by the *IAA to then massively overstate the losses from piracy. It has the potential to be a lost sale, but the question is how likely was that person to buy the product if an illegal version had not existed?<p>For example, without piracy, many of my friends (young twenties/teens, so we grew up with piracy) wouldn't have the same taste in music or movies without piracy because we simply would have never found a lot of the stuff we now greatly enjoy. The chances they would have purchased a good deal of their favorite media without piracy existing are utterly minuscule, and to say it's a possible lost sale somewhat glosses over the details, although it is technically correct. That's not to say all piracy would never be purchased, but I think that's the case for a lot of piracy. This is just my personal opinion, but I believe I've seen more statistics that point this way than.",1299013191

I lack enough applied C/C++ experience for this recommendation to have much weight.<p>Regarding SQL optimization - I suspect most people would be best served to work through Celko's books to have the most thorough grounding in applied SQL and then refer to the docs included with their RDBMs of choice that deal with access plans, performance monitoring, and general engine tuning.  The problem is that there are just too many knobs built into the different RDBMs products for it to be a general topic.

In particular, there is no way of doing I/O in JavaScript's traditional browser environment without providing a callback argument (I'm not counting interacting with the DOM as I/O here, and a couple of pedantic exceptions pointed out by judofyr below), and for the way in which the browser guarantees that only one callback will be executed at a time.<p>I think this idea of a constrained environment is very important.  If blocking I/O functions are strewn about the APIs you have at your disposal, then programmers tend to default to using them.<p>The other point he makes is that often evented APIs are just missing from the underlying platform. Does every way of doing some sort of I/O in the universe of Python APIs have variants that take callback arguments?  Even if the answer is 'yes' (which would surprise me) there is a minefield of blocking calls one would need to avoid in a disciplined manner.<p>...which may not be easy.  Tell me:  does myAwesomeFunction() do some blocking I/O under the hood?  You can't tell from the name.  Do the docs always make that clear, and provide an alternative with a callback?<p><i>Edited to include judofyr's exceptions â€” which bolster rather than undermine the point, because note that window.prompt's raison de'etre is to block for user interaction, and document.write is a RAM operation rather than disk or network I/O.</i>",1299011722

So to be clear, I'm talking about US Treasury Bills and not Canadian Treasury Bills. If you have a relationship with a financial institution you can buy them 'directly' (which is to say you own t-bills as opposed to buy into a fund which invests in t-bills) at $10,000 each. (insert caveat about 'Goldman Sachs' which handles sales of t-bills to individual investors and takes a cut, grrrr)<p>I don't have a magic bullet for finding a good financial advisor, mine cold called me in 1988 when I was at Sun  and convinced me to by some California Municipal bonds. Now going on 23 years later I still consult her for financial advice. I think its more of a style thing in terms of being able to talk with someone about what makes sense and what doesn't with investing.<p>To give you an example, I was waaaaaaaaaaay over invested in tech in the 90's. My advisor told me I was, but didn't push me to do something different. 2000 may not have had a y2k bug disaster but it was financially painful for me.<p>Some folks might blame their advisor for not being forceful enough and getting me out of tech, but I don't roll that way. I heard what she had to say, we talked about the pros and cons, and I went with 'let it ride for one more roll' (a reference to the game of craps).<p>I was less forgiving of a recommendation for a fund manager who turned out to be a total turd. But I'm a big believer in Iacocca's comment that if more than half your decisions are good then you are ahead of the game. So advice for looking for an advisor:<p>1) Interview them, ask them the 'hard' questions, like ""did you suggest to anyone to invest in Madoff's schemes?"" (note either 'no' or 'yes' has good follow up questions, ""No? It was such a great return why not?"", ""Yes? Even when the returns were out of line with other investments?"")<p>2) Know that the wider the diversification the closer to the mean you will get. If the S&P 500 has a return of X% and someone tells you they can guarantee you > 1.5X% return, then you know they are not being truthful :-) Doing about 50% better than the S&P 500 occasionally has sort of emerged for me as a good razor for becoming suspicious. (note that 'banks' make there boatloads of cash on volume, not because they beat the S&P by 50% but because they beat it by a small amount but on a lot of other peoples money, and FedRsrv money but that is a whole different rant)<p>3) Check for compatibility. Everyone is different in how they interact with each other, and money, like sex, is one of those things that often has some really strong notions that were burned into ones brain at an impressionable age which color the way you look at everything. Risk averse? Risk seeking? Money as a tool? Money as a game score? Do they define themselves by how much money they manage? Do you? Its perhaps the hardest thing to get right.",1299010053

PayPal can't simply decide\n   to shift its focus toward consumers, nor would they want to.\n</code></pre>\nThis reminds me of an outstanding article I read some time ago which advised: ""Attack your competitors' <i>strengths</i>, not their weaknesses.""  In other words, WePay might have failed if their goal was (for example) <i>just</i> to provide better customer service, PayPal's weakness.  This is because PayPal could ostensibly improve their customer service without affecting their bottom line.  <i>Merchant-oriented services</i> are PayPal's strength, and WePay ""attacked"" that strength by catering to non-merchants, which, as the article states, they could not do without a core shift in values and focus.",1299009985

We didn't just snap our fingers and one day get on Mashable. We had to come up with an idea, design it, execute it and promote it. All of those factors played into our being featured. Once featured we also had to make sure the servers stayed up, deal with users and try to help spread the app further. And all of those factors will be described in detail in forthcoming posts - I thought it would be relevant and interesting to give some of the back story first.",1299009903

They are not the same thing.<p>I'm sure that a lot of the folks on HN are here because someone in a startup emailed the other folks they know in startups and said ""check out my thread on HN and give me a vote"". That's how I first found out about it and YC.<p>Spam might be distasteful, but I don't think there is anything distasteful about someone from a startup introducing other startup founders to the site and asking them to get involved. It might take new members of the community a while to learn the rules, but there is no innate correlation between being new and being a spammer. And HN isn't normally an elitist place where length of tenure implies respectability. I don't think anyone wants to see it turn into the tech community equivalent of a country club.",1299009829

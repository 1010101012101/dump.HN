97502,comment,97274,97304,0,0,jacobolus,,,"<i>""FileMaker comes to mind.""</i><p>I'm not sure that's much of an example of a large-scale acquisition.  When Claris (a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple) bought the company that made FileMaker, it was hardly anything like the scale of Adobe today.  Since then, FileMaker has been spun off into its own wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple (I think it's technically just Claris renamed), when other parts of Claris were folded back into Apple after the NeXT merger.<p>Maybe you were referring to NeXT as a large-scale acquisition?",1200130429

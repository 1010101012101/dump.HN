Even with tiny eyes, they have the visual acuity of a cat. However, unlike a cat, they are only able to see a small portion of the visual field at a time, and must therefore scan the environment, keeping the rest of what has been scanned in memory. Portia spiders are known to spend up to an hour ""analyzing"" their environment before deciding on a course of action! Their sharp eyesight allows them to recognize the species of the spider they are currently stalking. One common tactic is to pluck deceptively at the web of their victim in order to manipulate it into reacting and moving into a more favorable position before the attack. Different species of spiders will respond in different ways, and so the Portia learn to intelligently apply different patterns of plucking to fit the circumstances. When encountering an unknown type of spider, Portia will try various experimental plucking motions, the successful results of which will be remembered and reused correctly in future attacks.<p>This amazingly rich and adaptive behavior it somehow manages to produce with a mere 500k neurons; about 2000 times less than the number used by Blue Gene in the experiment.",1258588363

Check her Amazon or B&N page.<p>Anyway, I agree that quality literature may, in reality, sell far fewer copies (although I'm sure that Pynchon has sold hundreds of thousands or millions) -- the reason I mentioned that was because one reasonable argument is this idea of fairness, where you could say, ""it's not fair that someone producing something of this quality should be paid so little, so the system should be different.""

(This confuses me, a programmer, but that is a bit too meta for <i>this</i> post.)<p>Despite this principle, Java's users asked for generics, and so the language designers added them.  But with a twist; they intentionally made the simple concept very confusing.  This is so that the next time someone asks for a feature, they can point at generics and say ""look at how badly we broke that!  do you really want us adding more features?""  A few episodes like this (closures will be next), and people won't ask for features anymore.

949370,comment,949139,949139,0,0,spokey,,,"Interesting idea.<p>I think the feedback thus far is a little harsh. There's room for improvement but I don't think your average user will be put off by the design. I'd reconsider the ""Register Now"" post it though--the font feels a bit angry and the post-it image is a bit pixelated.<p>Here's a few more general thoughts<p>1) I'd look for a way to make the concept of the site a more clear. I know a thing or two about affiliate programs and it took me a minute to understand how this site works/what it does.<p>I'm confused by your introductory paragraph and what it implies.  In four paragraphs of text you never really explain what's going on here.  What do you mean by ""use""? Where do you get your ""income""?  That's what makes it feel shady to me. I'd be more direct about what your business model is.<p>If I understand you correctly, you're just giving kickbacks of 50% of the money you make from affiliate deals.  If so, I'd focus on making that clear.   Find a way in layman's terms to say ""We register for affiliate programs. You buy products using our affiliate links. We pay you back 50% of what we earn."" For example, you could say something like ""The website that pays you back: Simply by starting your shopping experience here at Half2You, you'll earn up to 7.5% of your purchase price back in affiliate rewards"" maybe followed by more details on how affiliate programs work (something like question 2 on your current FAQ).<p>In particular, I'd reinforce the concept that (1) you aren't buying the products from Half2You and (2) you continue to shop at your regular online stores, you just start the process at Half2You in order to get the affiliate credit.<p>2) I'm confused by what I should expect to find under the categories, I half expected to find a list of products.  If you want people to use this as a browser homepage, I'd focus on making it work more like a gateway.  Maybe your homepage should look like the Opera speed dial--just quick graphical links to the stores I'm most likely to shop at.<p>3) While you're at it, in the store detail pages I'd be more explicit about the terms of your affiliate program.  E.g., go ahead and tell people what percent they'll make with a purchase from that store.  Among other things, this will help both you and them maximize the reward by selecting the store that gives them the most cash back.<p>4) I'd focus on affiliate programs and drop the revenue share on display and text ads.  That seems to be moving you into a gray area.<p>5) It seems as if you are toying with notions of user generated content on this site--ratings, reviews, coupon codes, etc.--maybe even having folks create content pages to drive organic (non-registered) traffic.  If I were you I'd focus my energy on the affiliate links in the short term, mainly from an MVP perspective but also because I think the kinds of user generated content you are likely to get will bring down the perceived quality of the site.  To the average user this feels too good to be true. You need to give visitors confidence that you're not somehow scamming them.<p>TL;DR: I'd try to be more transparent about what this site is and what it does.",1258586061

I used to work on science in this area: colleagues were working on Synroc, and I was working on theoretical techniques which you could apply to predicting how well it'd work. So it was on my mind anyway. But there's so much in the WIPP report, the richness and depth of it, that who cares if it actually happens? Seriously, the report's worth your time anyway.<p>I really couldn't get away from this. I used to do a lot of music.

Basically internal thought processes increase to an unhealthy degree as a way of compensating for the decrease in sensory perception, which is the same thing as happens in a sensory deprivation tank.<p>I think the initial cause of the depression can be either not enough sensory stimulation or too much thinking, as happens when there is a traumatic or very stressful event. If the latter is the root cause then you may need CBT or meditation or something like that. But in both cases using my sensory jumpstart method would work to fix a bout of depression, although it will keep recurring until you change your lifestyle (sensory as root cause case) or come to terms with whatever is stressing you, or at least learn to avoid the negative thought triggers.",1258585221

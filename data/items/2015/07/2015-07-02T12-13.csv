Huh, my computer says it&#x27;s 2015, a year in which the VC elite <i>is the new fucking corporate elite</i>.<p>I have about 6 feet of clearance this morning, so this post can get through, but the fucking high horse has got to go. Sorry, but I don&#x27;t have space to let it in.<p><i>There’s no air cover for startups. You don’t have backup troops. It’s just you versus the world. So naturally, if your product or service sucks, then you die. You can’t just look like you’re doing stuff. You actually have to make it, and almost totally on your own.</i><p>Correction. If your VCs don&#x27;t like you, then you die. Even if your company succeeds, you die if the VCs don&#x27;t like you. (Just as, in a large corporation, you can do your job very well but have your project taken over because the higher-ups don&#x27;t like you. Which is, let&#x27;s be cynical and honest, something we like even less than having the project fail.) If your VCs like you, then they will keep funding you and, if your company fails according to market forces, they&#x27;ll line you up with an executive position at a portfolio company while you recharge your batteries.<p><i>If doing things that aren’t effective don’t get you fired, then what does? Usually making mistakes that make your boss look bad. Big organizations are just groups of people, and people sure like to talk shit. The one thing you can’t do is look like a bozo. It’s fine to work really hard to no effect (hey, you worked hard!), but if you become a social liability, you’re donezo.</i><p>The last time I checked, small organizations were also groups of people. And the VC-funded world is just a postmodern corporation in which the VCs have set themselves up as the actual executive team while &quot;founders&quot; are mid-ranking product managers (who <i>might</i> get 8-figure bonuses, and promotion to the investor ranks, if they totally rape the odds... but are, for the time being, still in the second tier and forced to manage up into the man-child oligarchy on Sand Hill Road).<p>Corporate VPs don&#x27;t have a monopoly on reputation management at the expense of the corporate good.<p>Founders care more about their &quot;personal brand&quot; than their companies, and I don&#x27;t begrudge them for this at all. Fuck, I <i>also</i> care more (far, far more) about my career and reputation than whatever company I work at, at a given time. I take no issue with self-interest, and I don&#x27;t even necessarily think the &quot;disposable company&quot; model of the postmodern VC-istan meta-company is the wrong one. I just can&#x27;t fucking stand the high horse. You (rhetorical &quot;you&quot;; I&#x27;m not trying to be confrontational to any specific person) fuckers in VC and in founder-land aren&#x27;t much worse than the existing corporate elite, but you&#x27;re not better either. You fucking <i>are</i> the corporate elite. Accept it. The fact that you wear sandals instead of a suit when you lay people off doesn&#x27;t make you a better person.",1435841997

I could see myself running a 50-person tech company. By the time it was public, I&#x27;d be looking for a replacement and planning to cash out. I hate having to justify my own work to people less intelligent than I am, and that becomes your life when you&#x27;re the CEO of a publicly traded company.<p>&quot;Unwashed masses&quot; was off the mark and probably unneeded-- the actual enemy isn&#x27;t 100-IQ average Americans (who, since it&#x27;s 2015 and not 1347, are probably as clean as we are) who prefer fishing over running tech companies-- no one has a problem with them-- but management consultants and VC-land celebrities who <i>think</i> they&#x27;re what I actually am (Dunning-Kruger) and are just so hilariously <i>not</i>, but somehow end up in charge despite their intellectual mediocrity. Still, I understand her sentiment <i>completely</i> and I feel the same way. If I&#x27;m CEO, then as soon as my job is begging for permission to do great work and justifying time and expense to inferior copies of myself who have no insight but all the power, instead of just fucking doing great work, then please cash me out and fire me.<p>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think that the VCs are, on the whole, better than the mainstream business elite. Person by person, they&#x27;re worse: less intelligent, less capable, far more immature, and a hell of a lot worse in terms of organizational and social insight. The steel company CEO may not understand Haskell, but he fucking knows how to lead people and run a complex human organization. The typical Sand Hill Road VC doesn&#x27;t know either and is, therefore, pretty fucking useless except for the fact that he&#x27;s a gatekeeper to the man-child oligarchy that holds all the cards. The main benefit that you get as a private company (cf. Ms. Morrill) isn&#x27;t that you&#x27;re accountable to a higher quality of people (because VCs are not that) but that you&#x27;re accountable to <i>fewer</i> people and, therefore, have a better chance of drawing only aces. If you&#x27;re accountable to as many people as you are, once public, the probability of drawing all aces becomes really low-- and the 3&#x27;s and 4&#x27;s (which are found in both decks) often have better social skills and become the dominant decision-makers.<p>The major reason why VCs want to keep companies private, furthermore, has nothing to do with &quot;long-term vision&quot;. Sand Hill Road is essentially taking equity-market strategies (namely, insider trading and market manipulation) that have been illegal for nearly a century on the public market, and applying them to private markets. If you use inside information to beat up the public market, you go to jail. If you pick up a phone and tell your buddies to dump their Quuxbin stocks all at once you can corner it on the cheap and put your underachieving, favor-dependent friends into executive positions... then you&#x27;re guilty of market manipulation and go to jail. That kind of stuff happens (legally or at least quasi-legally) all the time in Silicon Valley.<p>The Sand Hill Road cartel (or, as I prefer it, man-child oligarchy) shows us a parallel universe in which pump-and-dump is the norm and businesses soar or fail not according to market demand for their (typically uninspiring) products, but based on the fluctuating needs of self-interested, careerist investors. This is not only ethically problematic, but it also contributes to the geographic concentration of technology funding, which has become toxic (both for the residents of the Bay Area, who pay obscene rents, and for the capital-deprived &quot;flyover&quot; rest of the country). See, anyone who wants to know why VC is so Bay Area-centric need only pay attention to what the VCs are actually doing. Because so many of the conversations that VCs have would utterly fucking ruin them if ever printed, they <i>have to</i> work face-to-face. That doesn&#x27;t mandate a specific area (e.g. San Francisco) but it does require geographic concentration.",1435841117

With &quot;unwashed masses&quot;, she&#x27;s not complaining about average, 100-IQ Americans who&#x27;d rather go fishing than run tech companies. No one (who&#x27;s worth taking seriously) has a problem with such people. She&#x27;s complaining about the management consultants and serial board members who haven&#x27;t actually done anything for 20 years who (because they think they&#x27;re intellectual leaders, when they&#x27;re not) toss out imbecilic suggestions like &quot;Cut R&D, set up stack ranking, and give a speech about &#x27;tough culture&#x27; to scare people&quot; when the Q2 numbers come out a little soft. There are a lot of utter fucking morons in the business world with a hell of a lot of influence and power. Some are in tech, some are outside of it; but it&#x27;s true that when you go public, the probability that drooling rubes will have the power and influence to force your hand on &quot;tough decisions&quot;, when you should actually be leading from the front and doubling down on R&D and morale, goes up.<p>&quot;Unwashed masses&quot; isn&#x27;t quite the right phrase, because it suggests low social class when the actual enemy is people of high social class and power who think they have intelligence and vision (rather than luck and social connection) to match it, but who are actually drooling, anti-intellectual, sheepish morons. Still, I agree strongly with her sentiment. Everything she&#x27;s saying is valid. Where she and I may disagree is on the locus of the morons. I think that most of technology&#x27;s leadership is just as bad as the mainstream business leadership (and I&#x27;m not sure that I buy into the distinction). Lucas Duplan and Evan Spiegel and Travis Kalanich weren&#x27;t shit onto this world by Fenrir. Someone decided to make them founders. Their existence is testament to the existence of drooling rubes in the VC ranks. The difference isn&#x27;t in the average quality of people (most VCs are fucking morons, just as most management consultants are) but in the number of people to whom you&#x27;re accountable. If you&#x27;re private, you&#x27;re accountable to a couple lead VCs and there&#x27;s a chance (less than 50% by definition, because most decision-makers are drooling rubes <i>everywhere</i>, but probably greater than 5%) that you got lucky and drew people who are actually worth a damn. If you&#x27;re public, you&#x27;re accountable to a much larger number of people, most of whom are talentless and overpaid and full of themselves, and you end up gaming short-term stats in order to keep them off your back.",1435839674

Performing skilled labor in close proximity to heavy machinery or some other dangerous environment is another example.  People in those environments don&#x27;t do the greatest work on day 1, but after they&#x27;ve become accustomed to performing their trade in a loud/busy/distracting environment that ability to focus on a detail intensive task while not tuning out the background (e.g. that skid steer driving behind you with a poorly loaded pallet balancing on the bucket forks).
I believe the often used idiom is &quot;eyes in the back of one&#x27;s head.&quot;<p>Back in the white collar world, if there&#x27;s a business problem that makes the &quot;uncomfortableness&quot; or increases the number of moving parts in the environment increase by 10 the people who operate daily at 5 are better prepared than those that operate at 2 (200% increase vs 500% increase).<p>I think it would be interesting to apply a practice like this to IT (and other support service) operations.  If day to day operations can be made to have a similar work flow as a crisis, people will be better prepared to deal with a crisis when things like remembering that &quot;X casually mentioned configuring something oddly in Y manner because of Z at lunch&quot; and deciding &quot;we need to ask X about Y before we do something to Z&quot; while trying to resolve the crisis because those little domino can have a huge effect if you don&#x27;t prevent them from cascading.<p>I&#x27;ll venture a guess that the odd floor plan keeps people on their toes, increasing alertness and the overall overlaps with what would result from increased attentiveness.

However the bigger challenge facing these &quot;stay private&quot; companies is their massive need for cash. Traditionally, private companies generate a lot of positive cash flow which they use to support debt loads from either banks or the bond markets. These companies are starting to access the debt markets (witness Uber&#x27;s large LOC and recent convert issuance) but without the cash flow to back up that debt. This will become an issue, because as of yet there is no private market for equity capital to be used to pay off debt at par - private equity and VC investors are not in that business as they have time-limited funds which need to produce positive cash returns in 7 - 10 years to pay back the LPs... The public markets represent the largest pool of permanent capital out there so unless the Unicorns stop bleeding cash they will have to come to the public markets eventually.<p>AMZN seems like the best possible outcome for these companies.",1435838845

I hacked it together really quickly to solve a problem, which is solved orders of magnitude faster than commercial solutions that tried to be overly clever. I like it because while it was gross and bad and would be embarrassing to read, in reality grep is crazy fast and the OS cached the text file once you&#x27;d read it once.

9825190,comment,9824406,9824574,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>If you haven&#x27;t already, you should be betting on React. It&#x27;s the future</i><p>But last week the future was AngularJS, and the week before that it was Ember or Backbone or Knockout, and a few days earlier it was jQuery. Next week it will be Angular 2.0, maybe, or something with Web Components, and the week after that we&#x27;re all abandoning JS in favour of some declarative functional language that hasn&#x27;t been written yet but will be on TodoMVC tomorrow.<p>Seriously, this is a <i>beta</i> of a <i>pre-release</i> package. The article mentions, as motivation for the major architectural change, some other react-something packages, and literally in the opening section of their README.md they say things like &quot;This project is a work-in-progress. Though much of the code is in production on flipboard.com, the React canvas bindings are relatively new and the API is subject to change.&quot;<p>By all means let&#x27;s experiment with newer and potentially better ways to build sites and apps, but betting heavily on an ecosystem this immature for a long-term professional project seems like asking for trouble.<p><i>Isn&#x27;t this what we have all been waiting for?</i><p>It&#x27;s certainly not something I&#x27;ve been waiting for, as someone who works in the relevant fields. Rather like &quot;isomorphic&quot; libraries, I feel combined web/native generation is mostly a solution in search of a problem. No doubt a few people really do have that problem, but I&#x27;m guessing that for most day-to-day work in the real world this theoretical flexibility adds little practical value. There&#x27;s no particular reason the same tools should be good choices for writing both web and native apps, any more than we should expect the same tools to necessarily be good choices for writing both server-side and client-side code in a web app.<p>In this particular case, I&#x27;m more concerned by the change in emphasis than the technical changes. To me, the big advantage of React over most other front-end libraries and frameworks is the efficient DOM updating, which in turn makes this kind of component model viable with acceptable performance where various other UI libraries/frameworks have struggled in the past. However, it looks like the React team think that is a secondary benefit and the real advantage is using components.<p>I can already build a complicated web app rendering layer using the same modular design skills I&#x27;ve spent the last 30 years learning in other programming contexts. After all, that&#x27;s what I did before we had the modern generation of template/component driven frameworks, when we had to update the DOM manually using plain JS or libraries like jQuery. So did plenty of other people. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but while React might be a sensible enough choice for part of the UI rendering work, I don&#x27;t see why it has anything unique or special to offer compared to many other libraries here.<p>If the React team focussed on the efficient DOM updates, flexible but reasonably simple component model, and then stability so the community could develop the ecosystem around a solid foundation, I could see it becoming a good choice for projects that can&#x27;t afford to have their dependencies constantly shifting around and the maintenance overheads that incurs. But this separation and increased emphasis on react-native and the like feels like it&#x27;s leaving behind the very things that made React attractive in a very crowded field of JS UI libraries.",1435927639

What I wanted to do was my own test of it against plain old vanilla JavaScript…The docs claim that JavaScript is fast, and it’s meddling with the DOM that’s slow.

I can now refute the straw man theory that 100% of power is determined by social factors: being in the NBA provides money and power, and being tall (predominantly a genetic trait) drastically improves your ability to get in.<p>Let me more carefully state my question. Suppose there were genetic factors which cause at least 15% of observed variation in power within modern society (or perhaps cause >15% of variation across societies).

Complete one task after the other starting with the hardest.<p>This approach goes against the often spread advice that you should start with the easiest tasks, which are probably fast to complete, in order to get quickly a feeling of accomplishment which keeps you motivated.
I think this approach is wrong and here is why:<p>IMO our brains always weigh risk multiplied with investment against reward, and as long as the reward outweighs (risk * investment), we are motivated: Risk meaning here, that you invest time and effort but eventually you miss the deadline and are not paid the full reward. The more time we let pass, without completing anything, then the risk of not getting the rewards becomes bigger and eventually it is not worth our effort anymore, and our brain finds more rewarding things to do (procrastinates). So why should we start with the hard tasks first?<p>Because, given that we start with the easy ones first, we reduce the available time to complete the hard tasks, and by the time that we start with the hard ones, the risk of failing becomes too big in order to be still motivated. In contrary, when we start with the hard ones, of course it takes longer to finish them, and the time left for the easy ones is less, but our brain can easily estimate the risk of easy tasks, and it will find that it&#x27;s quite possible to get the final rewards, because we already finished the hard ones.<p>The realisation changed my life.

Because while I won&#x27;t condemn reddit on a whim and call it a bad actor, I also don&#x27;t find any of this trustworthy at all. I&#x27;d even say, unless the /r/pics &quot;takeover&quot; was the &quot;root mod&quot; (or whatever it&#x27;s called, I never made a subreddit) locking out all other mods, if this was actually admins protecting &quot;their&quot; assets, made by the community, that&#x27;d surely be crossing the line for me.<p>As would be paying lip service to mods as to how swell everything will be to get mods to get subs back up, while people with scheduled AMA still don&#x27;t know how to get in touch with the people Victoria had the contact info for. I don&#x27;t have a link for the last bit, and it was just a claim by someone anyway (didn&#x27;t check if they actually were involved with AMA stuff), so don&#x27;t take my word for it - but that mod mail really does read so fluffy while making no real commitments to anything, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me in the least.<p>Anyway, I would rather see blacked out subs in support of something I agree with, than active subs that are testament to a shameful episode and state of things. They have my support to black out all the things, for days, weeks and months. For how ever long is necessary. If reddit becomes a place putting effort into again, I&#x27;ll enjoy it like nothing was ever gone. Otherwise, might as well go out with a bang and some pride. There is infinitely more where reddit came from, and maybe a better site will be born because of all this somewhere down the road. Maybe reddit can reform, but it clearly needs some boundaries, so this blackout has my full support. Enough already, users and communities are not dough to be shaped however one wishes, to be disrespected like helpless dependents. It&#x27;s a bit like that Fight Club bathroom scene: <i>&quot;We cook your meals, we take care of you when you&#x27;re sick, and we also make the sites that pay your salary worth visiting.

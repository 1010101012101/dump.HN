I can&#x27;t even believe it when I see the tuition costs, even at my public university.<p>I find myself wanting to continue to give people the same advice I received, the same advice that served me so well, and the advice I believe in strongly—go to college. It will make you a better person. You will become yourself there, and improve yourself and grow. Better, improved, grown, whole people are the ones who earn more money, but that&#x27;s a side-effect, not a goal.<p>But when tuition is <i>four times</i> what it was when I found that advice invaluable—it&#x27;s much more difficult. Even in this thread I&#x27;m still giving the same narrative around the intangible and immeasurable value of a college education (I believe in it still, very strongly), but the cost is out of whack.<p>This is what an economic imbalance feels like, folks. There&#x27;s beginning to be a huge rift between the perceived value of a university education (invaluable, extreme, incomparable experience, must-do, must-have) and the price (extremely high).<p>We cannot comprehend it. After all, who can put a price tag on being a better, improved, more whole person? Is it $20,000? Sure. What if we double it? $40,000? Sure, still invaluable. $80,000? Remains invaluable, intangible, unmeasurably important. $160,000? How can we deal with this? How can we put a price tag on a whole experience that remains, throughout all the number shifting, invaluable?<p>Needs intervention.<p>I still fully believe that the university experience is invaluable. But that&#x27;s not the problem. The problem is that it&#x27;s become overpriced because we are mentally unable to reconcile the immensity of its effect on a life with a single price tag. Thus, it is open to economic &quot;play.&quot;<p>So we rail against it and come up with alternatives, and rationalize that it&#x27;s not as invaluable as we thought it was after all, and, well, why don&#x27;t we take some parts here and connect them with this series of tubes and voila! This is the same thing for only a fraction of the price; why would you ever go to that big overpriced agglomerated monster anyway when you can get these results right here?<p>All the while, I can&#x27;t help but see holes in the real quality of the experience of growing up. You have to be smart about it, I guess.<p>Clearly, there&#x27;s a reason this is an argument, and not a clear-cut case of college being valuable so you should go do it, and the reason is a price tag.<p>At least it&#x27;s simple.",1443675082

Drug companies are not allowed to advertise drugs for any reason than what they were officially approved for. <i>However</i>, doctors are allowed to have discretion in this matter...for example, if they know a certain drug prescribed only for, say, hair loss, is also good for erectile dysfunction, and they&#x27;ve read enough of the literature to prescribe this confidently...then they don&#x27;t have to go strictly by FDA regulations.<p>This freedom is not a bad thing in itself...I mean, it reflects the reality that have effects (good and bad) that are independent of a regulatory process. One extreme case that I can remember is when Avastin -- originally prescribed to fight cancer -- was found to be as effective for treating eye disease at $50 a pop as a drug that cost $1,950 [1]...and so there was controversy over whether doctors should be allowed to prescribe Avastin before it was officially approved by the FDA for this usage.<p>So it became obvious to drug companies that if they advertise/befriend doctors, they could influence them to prescribe drugs for these off-label uses. Maybe some of those uses were completely legitimate (and profitable). Some obviously should not have been pushed for off-label use, such as highly-addictive painkillers approved only for use by the most serious cancer afflictions being prescribed to people with migraines. When you consider that highly competitive pharma sales reps had the ability to basically know exactly how much each doctor prescribed on a weekly (daily?) basis, and thus, how much to visit and chat them up...you basically have a bunch of not-<i>technically</i>-illegal-things that were maybe fine on their own, but added up, eventually, to what the Justice Dept. considered to be fraudulent activity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304868004577376310954390608"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014240527023048680045773763...</a>",1443674682

Most sites don&#x27;t make a claim the content is free, but people like to assume it is and take it.  It doesn&#x27;t put the providers in a good light that it&#x27;s become the norm that there&#x27;s an unspoken agreement going on that they are benefiting from, but it&#x27;s not any better on the consumer side, as taking something without confirming it&#x27;s actually free isn&#x27;t appropriate either.<p>What we have here is an unspoken agreement about a transaction taking place, and both sides are interpreting it in their best interests without confirming that&#x27;s okay for the other side.  Everyone&#x27;s an asshole in this scenario, which I think fairly accurately describes reality.<p>To put this in relatable terms, it&#x27;s like walking down a country road and coming upon a crate of apples.  While they don&#x27;t say they are free, they <i>look</i> kind of free, and you&#x27;re hungry.  You take one, and all of a sudden a guy jumps out from behind a tree and demands that you owe him a favor and some info about yourself for eating his apples.  He&#x27;s a scumbag, it&#x27;s obvious, for trying to engineer a scenario where he can solicit business from people that might otherwise pass him by, but the passerby that partakes without confirming that it&#x27;s actually free isn&#x27;t without fault either.<p>Now, we see that some people are pretty good at just ignoring the shop keeper, and they keep reaping the benefits of free apples.  Sure, the owner of the apples is an asshole, but the other people are still stealing his apples, and regardless of how much an asshole he is, that&#x27;s not okay.  At this point, both parties are acting in bad faith.  Unfortunately, the problem is muddied by the facts that people decided long ago, primarily due to these shady guys and small favors, that apples just aren&#x27;t worth paying money for anymore, and rarely the guys that own the apples even sell your info and/or favors to really shady people, so it&#x27;s often safer to ignore them and give them nothing.<p>P.S.

It&#x27;s a sort of golden age or nirvana fallacy, looking back at universities of the past or your &#x27;ideal university&#x27; as somehow better or more serious than the ones that exist today.<p>For the past, at least, this wasn&#x27;t true at all. If anything universities were were sillier, rowdier places. If it wasn&#x27;t alcohol, it was other mischief and vice, more serious sports, and more pervasive greek systems. The offenses against seriousness you list aren&#x27;t even that bad, to be honest. They suffer from a sort of &#x27;vocal minority&#x27; effect, where they seem extremely loud and horrible, but in reality are just the outward projections of a minority percentage or a minority effect.<p>A university is a microcosm of society. It has never been and will never be a completely serious place, because humans are not completely serious beings. Part of the glorious beauty and effectiveness of the university, even in its average form, is that it allows humans to be humans and to explore humanity; not only its serious aspects, but also its flaws, vices, and many varied possibilities. This is not a negative &#x27;dominant influence,&#x27; but instead a highly functional, necessary, and intentional nod to the most effective development of a human being.<p>Just look at it: there is somehow a great seriousness coming out of this crazy world of drinking, hyper-social behavior, hookups, greek systems, grade inflation, and college sports. This should tell you something: the whole experience of college and the seriousness of its intended result are not at odds, but instead—paradoxically in a sort of crazy zen-like relationship—necessary for one another to exist. There is a profound recognition that a serious, well-balanced human being capable of greatness is not constructed by seriousness itself, nor of serious places, but rather by a <i>plentiful variety of experience.</i><p>It is not the aim of universities to be serious places. They know better. They understand the complexities of culture, of society, and of the development of young people at a very critical stage of life. In the end, they most certainly achieve serious results very consistently—not in spite of their lack of seriousness, but in large part because of it, and especially thanks to an appreciation for it.<p>And on an anecdotal note, I believe in universities strongly because I did indeed experience a great one, and I know many people who had their own great experiences as well. At my university, I saw and experienced all of the things you mention. All of these unserious offenses should have distracted me from my academic focus, but they did not. They only enhanced it and helped form me into the person I am today, and I strongly, unequivocally believe that I am better for it.",1443673130

At the time that Red Ash was announced, Comcept claimed that Mighty No. 9 was pretty much done and that they needed to get another game into the pipeline. Midway through the Red Ash campaign, people noticed that Mighty No. 9 was marked by retailers as being delayed. When Comcept was questioned about this, they claimed that it was a mistake...only shortly after the Red Ash Kickstarter failed did Comcept admit that Mighty No. 9 would be delayed [1].<p>As you can imagine, that led backers to think that Comcept had tried to be hush-hush about the delay so that it wouldn&#x27;t affect the Red Ash campaign.

You both want to have an accurate inventory of the apps/boxes your organization has (highly non-trivial at scale) and you don&#x27;t want dev/staging/etc to be publicly accessible.  The simplest way is to firewall off traffic to them.<p>If you need them to be accessible for e.g. callbacks from public services, default-deny everything and control access at the network or frontend web server level before things get to your applications (which are likely going to be your vulnerable underbelly).<p>In most cases, the dev servers will not themselves have really interesting things on them.  They will instead be used by attackers to pivot to other, more interesting servers on your network.  Patreon&#x27;s understanding is that the dev servers lacked SSH keys to the production servers -- that&#x27;s a good thing, but after the bad guy has a dev server with local network access to interesting machines, they&#x27;re going to do things like e.g. probe for exposed admin consoles to network appliances, outdated RedMine instances, internal tools, etc etc, and they <i>will</i> eventually own every machine that talks to any machine that your dev server can talk to.

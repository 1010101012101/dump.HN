However, in the mobile space, ARM has a huge advantage of licensing their cores to dozens of SoC manufacturers that provide very appealing, integrated, low cost chips for mobile vendors to build products on.

6319639,comment,6312903,6313871,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"The commentary was terse (hiking in the mountains, limited IP access) but accurate. I have designed interesting algorithms and software on large-scale database and HPC systems for much of my adult life. As a consequence, I am much more familiar with these domains than most casual programmers or academics in these fields.<p>The important point was that ideas like MapReduce and Spanner are literally rehashes of very old ideas that never fell out of use in some domains. But they are so old that no one that uses those ideas would dream of publishing a paper on it because it has been in continuous use for ages. In most cases, a deep enough dive in the dead tree literature will often turn up examples of these in real implementations. I learned most of it from graybeards working on cool stuff when I was young, not from the literature.<p>I am not exactly young but both MapReduce and Spanner predate <i>my</i> time in computer science. BigTable was actually a novel composition of existing but obscure bits of computer science so I give Google full credit for that.<p>Google has shown an exceptional ability to exploit ignored or forgotten computer science. However, to the extent they exploit it there is often little invention beyond those that they borrow the ideas from. In that respect, I think the credit is somewhat misplaced with respect to invention.",1378195136

How do you decide to work for this company? An interview is a two-way street. Engage with the interviewer, connect with the culture. Push back (a little) on their ideas, see what happens.<p>- I hate puzzles. I think they&#x27;re junk and have never found them to be good predictors (for either party). I usually (1) parlay it into some relevant experience &quot;I encountered something like that when I...&quot; or (2) describe how I&#x27;d solve a problem rather than dig into it [1].<p>- Demonstrate your common sense, flexibility, good social skills. Talk about how you work in a team. Talk about what you do when you encounter a problem you can&#x27;t solve yourself. Talk about any self-lead learning you do. You need to fit in and you need the company to demonstrate they want you to help.

It clearly explained how the regex engine works so I can simulate it in my head and understand why a given regex does or doesnt work.

That free tutorial was enough to get me very comfortable with regexes.<p>I also tested my understanding afterwards with some online exercises chosen from these lists:<p><a href=""http://www.emacs.uniyar.ac.ru/doc/em24h/emacs081.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacs.uniyar.ac.ru/doc/em24h/emacs081.htm</a><p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/category/11323.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/category/11323.aspx</a><p>This reference was handy while doing the exercises: <a href=""http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html</a><p>Knowing regexes has been very helpful to me in general. I have used regexes in reformatting my code through find and replace, in finding the code that I need to edit next or that could be causing a certain problem, in writing Apache config URL rewriting rules, in writing poor mans language parsers that assisted me in generating code, in converting raw data into programming language literals, in understanding user input validation rules, and in other ways. I think that any serious developer who expects to work with more than one programming language in their lifetime should understand regular expressions. Thus, I encourage the OP to try learning regexes, using the resources linked above.<p>That said, I agree that regexes could be easier to understand. I rather wish that Perl 6s revised, simpler regex syntax (<a href=""http://perlcabal.org/syn/S05.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perlcabal.org/syn/S05.html</a>) were the universal standard.<p>If you use regexes a lot, and get mentally strained by the complexity of some of your bigger ones, consider learning about parsers too, another type of tool that lets you manipulate text in more powerful ways, with longer but more readable code than regexes. <a href=""http://kschiess.github.io/parslet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kschiess.github.io/parslet/</a> is a simple parsing library to start with if you use Ruby.

6319579,comment,6312903,6313731,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"As a general point, a lot of computer science is poorly documented or difficult to find in the literature but well-known among the practitioners that use it. A great example is the recent flurry of activity (including patent activity) around &quot;hyperdimensional hashing&quot; and similar concepts. The irony is that the concepts are so old that some of the original patents have expired but the work is sufficiently forgotten that academics are attempting to re-patent those ideas. I am familiar with it because those algorithms are <i>de rigueur</i> for some types of massively parallel systems (I&#x27;ve been designing parallel systems for ages). No one publishes papers on it though because it is not new to those people. A large part of it is that much of the original literature is lost in paper form and cannot be found electronically. I&#x27;ve been burned by this personally, having done work that I later discovered had been previously done in the 1980s by a respected academic but which is not cited in any modern literature; from the standpoint of modern literature, the work is completely forgotten. But it had been done and rare people exist that are familiar with it.<p>So more specifically (I got back from vacation a couple hours ago, forgive the terseness):<p>Spanner is an old, old idea in literature and a number of bespoke systems were built on the concept. Ancient transaction processing literature mentions it, I&#x27;ve worked with a few crusty mainframe environments that used variants of it. It was considered a stupid idea for decades because the hardware required for a reasonable implementation was outrageously expensive for most applications. Atomic clocks and satellite-delivered time codes don&#x27;t cost what they used to. I used to have a transaction processing book from the 1980s that described a couple specific implementations that were quite close to Spanner (written by a couple guys with Indian surnames, wish I remember the book). It had been written off so long ago for inexpensive commodity systems that apparently it took Google to rediscover it but it never fell out of use.<p>Similarly, I think a lot of people in the HPC world were surprised to discover that MapReduce was patentable. Not every problem in HPC looks like computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is often the stereotype. If you are actually an academic then you should know better than anyone that the number of cites is misleading. The MapReduce model (though not under that name) was a standard design pattern for some non-CFD problems in HPC in every respect going back to at least the 1990s. The specific novelty claimed by MapReduce has never been clear to me. A lot of the (terrible) compilers for obscure HPC platforms back in the day transformed the code into a canonical MapReduce model. Maybe I am missing what makes Google&#x27;s version unique?",1378194192

6319559,comment,6319229,6319229,7,0,irahul,,,"Nice work. Personally I will still use the raw regex rather than the method calls to build the regular expression. As another commenter pointed out, the example regex is complex than it should be. It can be reduced to:<p><pre><code>    pat = re.compile(r&#x27;^ \w+ @ [A-Za-z]\w*  \. \w+ $&#x27;, re.X)
    if pat.match(&#x27;r@acnt.me&#x27;):
        print &quot;woot&quot;
</code></pre>
I won&#x27;t bother explaining this regex(too simple). However, if it were something complex, I would put inline comments:<p><pre><code>    pat = re.compile(r&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;^ \w+  # rahul
                    @
                    [A-Za-z]\w*  # thoughtnirvana
                    \.
                    \w+ # com
                    $&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;,
                    re.X)
</code></pre>
Notes about the example regex:<p><pre><code>  var regEx = {(?:^)[A-Za-z]([A-Za-z]+|(?:\d+))(@{1,1})[A-Za-z]+(.{1,1})[A-Za-z]+(?:$)}

(?:^), (?:$) - This is the same as simply using ^. It isn&#x27;t captured by default so there isn&#x27;t a need to mark it non-capturing.<p>([A-Za-z]+|(?:\d+)) - What&#x27;s going on here? You have a capturing group and within that capturing group, you have the or part marked as non capturing. What&#x27;s the intent?<p>(@{1,1}) - @{1,1} is the same as @. Also, why are you capturing it?

I&#x27;m aware of EntroPay who offer prepaid virtual cards.<p>Is anyone offering a master card with full access to my account, but allowing users to spin up virtual cards that work in different ways? e.g., I could create one which only works with a wildcard match of &quot;<i></i><i>amazon</i><i></i>&quot; on the transactor field. Or a virtual card which is capped at $300/month (retainer for an employee) or one which has a maximum of $100 (gift card for a friend). Or only works in a particular country or currency. And can all be shut down whenever required.<p>Would this even be possible with the way credit cards are currently set up?",1378193492

Every single one looks like they designed it back in 2002 and just stopped and said, &quot;meh, this is good enough.&quot;<p>* You pay for everything.

You thought about the bank on your way to work? 2.40 ILS.<p>* Checks can not be stopped. In fact it is illegal to issue a stop-payment on a check.<p>* The bank scrutinizes EVERY CHECK YOU WRITE. If the signature doesn&#x27;t match the signature they have on file -- even a little bit because you were in a rush -- they reject the check. Oh, yeah, and they examine it by hand, not by machine. Oh and when they reject your check for technical reasons? 9 ILS.<p>* Direct debit... ok, actually, they&#x27;ve got this one covered. It&#x27;s super easy. Except you still have to fill out a form that authorizes said payee to debit your account.<p>* You pay a monthly fee to the bank for the privilege of banking there. Not all banks have a monthly fee necessarily, but they all have surcharges so it all amounts to the same thing at the end of the day.<p>Oh gosh, don&#x27;t even get me started on just how awful and inefficient the system is here.

Just to be sure I know what we&#x27;re discussing, could you provide a reference to the Statistical Aggregate Interpretation?  What you&#x27;re suggesting -- that the information is there, but we just don&#x27;t know which one -- sounds a lot like a hidden variables theory.  Unfortunately, all theories with local realism (which includes hidden variables theories) are ruled out experimentally by Bell&#x27;s theorem. [1]<p>I like your classical frog example because it&#x27;s a thought experiment that illustrates how classical particles behave, and we can compare the distribution of the classical frogs to the distribution of whatever we&#x27;re measuring (like electrons), and if the distributions we get are different, then we&#x27;ll learn that whatever we&#x27;re measuring is behaving non-classically.  However, the probability density you gave for the frogs in the classical case, cos^2(pi*X/A), is incorrect.  The probability distribution for the classical case the way you set it up will, in fact, be almost Gaussian (but not precisely for reasons that aren&#x27;t relevant or worth discussing here)[2].  The combined probability distributions for frogs coming from the two doors will be the sum of two individual Gaussians, so it will be a &quot;two-humped&quot; distribution.  As a point of fact, if you run your frog experiment, there will be two wet spots.  It will not look like an interference pattern precisely because there is no superposition and no destructive interference.  The fact that electrons in Hitachi&#x27;s experiment display a &quot;many-humped&quot; distribution is good evidence that the electrons are not following the same rules as the frogs, and hence that the electrons are behaving non-classically.<p>> in Hitachi experiment it is shown explicitly clear that quantum interference is emerging only for multiple particles.<p>This is the exact opposite of what the Hitachi experiment shows.  The experiment is interesting and surprising precisely because particles are sent one at a time but still show an interference pattern.  The experiment shows a single particle interfering with itself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem</a><p>[2] It&#x27;s easy enough to show the general idea with a Monte-Carlo simulation.",1378193284

And I imagine Microsoft is still on the top of that list, but I don&#x27;t think they have a radically stronger position. It is a very profitable position for now, but that wasn&#x27;t what the original comment was about.<p>The question is whether they can again &quot;control the future of computing&quot; or just continue to make a lot of money on roughly the status quo (i.e. simply be &quot;yet another enterprise software company&quot;). I can&#x27;t speak for the original commenter, but I suspect their emphasis was on &quot;enterprise software company with no apparent mission except to make money&quot; rather than &quot;yet another&quot;, so that line could probably be replaced with something like &quot;yet another boring, immensely profitable company&quot;.<p>On that question, I think you can make a good argument that some of their footholds are actually a handicap now. For example, Windows and Office make so much money that the company becomes conservative, unwilling to do anything that might significantly disrupt them.<p>They haven&#x27;t released an OS without the Windows name in about 20 years now.

The smartphone market is largely consumer right now, so why not try a different brand approach?<p>Yes, Microsoft dominates in the enterprise space right now, but they are losing badly in the consumer space (which will eventually break into the enterprise position) and the cloud space (which is the enterprise position of new companies). What do you see them doing to change the course now?<p>On a &quot;consumer tech&quot; tangent, IE 11 will finally implement WebGL. Direct3D gave them a unique hold on desktop gaming, paired with a really strong console gaming position. WebGL finally forced them to submit. I expect there are a few divisions that are wickedly pissed off now, and I totally understand why: Direct3D is now in its deathbed.<p>An utterly dominant, gaming tech position undermined and eliminated in the span of maybe five years.<p>In the enterprise market, I&#x27;d give them a longer timeline, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine a moribund, hydrogen blimp of that size managing to see (much less avoid) the fireball collapse that&#x27;s coming.",1378192593

For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after each file name\n      instead of the usual newline.  This option makes the output  unambiguous,  even  in  the\n      presence  of file names containing unusual characters like newlines.  This option can be\n      used with commands like find -print0,  perl  -0,  sort  -z,  and  xargs  -0  to  process\n      arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.\n\n   -z, --null-data\n      Treat the input as a set of lines, each  terminated  by  a  zero  byte  (the  ASCII  NUL\n      character)  instead of a newline.

The GNU find -print0 option  produces\n      input suitable for this mode.\n</code></pre>\nman find:<p><pre><code>   -print0\n      True;  print  the  full  file  name on the standard output, followed by a null character\n      (instead of the newline character that -print uses).  This allows file names  that  con\n      tain newlines or other types of white space to be correctly interpreted by programs that\n      process the find output.

4369695,comment,4369079,4369517,10,0,derleth,,,"> UTF-8 is a variable length Unicode encoding like UTF-16, but defaults to a small one-byte code unit and has a famously elegant algorithm<p>... that is 100% compatible with ASCII, and, therefore, is the only Unicode encoding scheme you can safely use in filenames and to send text through applications that don't know about Unicode at all.<p>The primary reason is that in UTF-32 and UTF-16, the byte 0x00 may appear in the encoding of characters other than '\0'. This is not something pre-Unicode applications can deal with, because in ASCII the byte 0x00 always means '\0', which was always used for string termination.<p>Therefore, any application that processes ASCII and leaves non-ASCII alone (common in the real world) is instantly compatible with UTF-8.<p>Here's a fascinating discussion about character encodings in filenames, including comments from Linus Torvalds and Theodore Ts'o:<p><a href=""http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/utf8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/utf8.html</a><p>The upshot is, Linux, like most if not all Unix-like OSes, speaks bytestreams, and doesn't try to interpret characters. The only rules you need, therefore, are that filenames can't contain the byte 0x2f ('/' in ASCII) except as a path separator and can't contain the byte 0x00 at all. Therefore, you need a character encoding that will not use the bytes 0x2f or 0x00 to represent characters other than '/' and '\0', respectively. The only Unicode encoding that meets that constraint is UTF-8.<p>Also: The elegant algorithm means that it's statistically highly, <i>highly</i> improbable that any text that <i>can</i> be interpreted as valid UTF-8 isn't UTF-8. Given that it's entirely valid to treat ASCII as UTF-8, defaulting to UTF-8 is, as you say, a good thing to do.",1344671643

Then take a tangent plane at that point. The gravity well is below that plane, and hence falls away from you, along the line towards and away from the gravity source, but is above the plane in the fore/aft direction.

You are totally discounting incentives such as first to market.<p>>For those that disagree, I challenge you to open source all of the code you're working on for your companies. Then, I'll set up an exact clone of your application (including using your logo) and start making money from your work. That would encourage you to innovate right? Cool, innovate, then I'll use the new code you made, along with the new logo and continue making money from your work.<p>This is a ridiculous straw man, nobody here is talking about abolishing all aspects of intellectual property law including trademarks.<p>> Intellectual property is a critical piece of developing a competitive advantage.

And those that can't probably don't need to or can get someone to help them. I just don't see a huge problem out there that needs to be solved.<p>Why don't i like the solution? Well it breaks a well known standard which will confuse others: show me your bash_profile and bashrc...wait what they are the same?? Secondly it invokes the terror of symlinks and the spaghetti mess that often results.<p>Sort of a nice idea in theory but i would not do it in practice.",1344669121

This means that overall, less money would be moving from students/graduates to schools.<p>Schools would have to find a way to manage with smaller budgets or get more government support.",1344668900

Maybe if you look harder, you're wrong""<p>I always ask back, ""How are you doing?"", and have always received a smile and a ""Good, thank you"" in response - never offense.<p>Maybe if you didn't lie to the cashier at Target and told them what you didn't find, you would notice that some people might go out of their way to help you.<p>Have a good one? If we start being so literal about everything in English, we're going down a very dangerous road.<p>It's funny that the author is writing on the topic of ""caring"", but himself comes across as cynical and overtly negative.",1344668873

Otherwise it's a completely different camera setup.<p>Also, while obviously technology has improved, the industry doesn't necessarily move towards smaller pixels as a rule. To illustrate that: I work for a company that designs and produces image sensors, and I can tell you that we have one sensor product that has a resolution of just over one megapixel, but it's larger in area than our seventy megapixel product.<p>It all depends on the specifics of the project, and I can imagine that operating in space has certain constraints that prohibit <i>just swapping</i> in another sensor. These camera's are scientific instruments, and that means different rules apply.",1344668516

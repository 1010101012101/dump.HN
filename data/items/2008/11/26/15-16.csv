I will, however, correct your statement about media bias.<p>Google ""Conservative Media Bias"" -- lots of folks see conservative media bias. We have a few liberal friends that fall into this category, just as we have a few conservatives lambasting the liberal bias. Try visiting Media Matters for America, an entire non-profit ""dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media."" Lots of folks think the media has a conservative bias -- usually because most media organizations are owned by large corporations with corporate interests.<p>Media bias (and the way news stories are put together) in my opinion is a fun topic in which all political views can play. Things like selection of stories to appear above the fold, the increasing use of commentators as anchors on some networks, the way most reporters vote, whether or not you can truly separate yourself from the story, or the competition between wire stories and local reporters -- it's all goodness. The idea that somehow we shouldn't ""play ref"" with media sources is rather odd. I usually multi-source any significant news. And people of like opinion would obviously ""play ref"" in the same way, right? Sounds like a natural thing for left/right entertainment people to talk about.",1227713562

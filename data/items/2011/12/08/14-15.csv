Now, Microsoft's Visual Studio or Apple's Xcode can hang, and the other Java IDEs are at least in the same league.<p>But very few IDEs can do a decent job of completing code for dynamic languages (especially those unlike Objective-C, with its opt-in (but fairly ubiquitous) type declarations). RubyMine (which is a variant of IDEA) does this much better than anything else I've seen.<p>Most IDEs and editors tend to offer to complete e.g. every method defined by every class, or they fail to offer to complete the thing that you mean. That's pretty much garbage.",1323356382

If Dart is delivered to the browser in source form, you'll still want script compressors and/or tools like Closure Compiler to eliminate unused code. Even if Dart is delivered to the browser in bytecode format you'll need a toolchain on the backend--and you'll still need symbol tables for client debugging.<p>If anything, the toolchain and project setup will be <i>more</i> complex for Dart developers if they want to support all browsers. They'll need to create one set of files for Chrome with native Dart and cross-compile to JavaScript for all other browsers. Then they'll need to conditionally include one set of script files or the other.",1323356268

Usually when people see incompetence in action, trying to do the right thing, they'll just throw their hands in the air waiting for a solution from the government.<p>But licenses encourage bribery, nepotism and other means of gaming the system. The effects are quite contrary to what people want.<p>Instead, grant these licenses <i>by default</i> without fees or limits, then let the employer decide if a candidate is good enough. Let the market decide if the employer is good enough. And if people's lives are threatened because of somebody's incompetence, then invalidate his license for a couple of months or permanently. If people's lives are lost because of incompetence, then throw that somebody in jail.<p>This is a system based on meritocracy and punishment in case of big failures.

The article blames this on the increasing costs of adhering to all the national and state laws regarding disabled children, while another argument could be made that schools are more concerned about obtaining minimum scores on standardized tests to receive funding.<p>It may seem completely insensitive to argue against helping disabled students, but it seems to be happening at the expense of the gifted students.  When you read articles like this one, you realize that the people who move society forward in leaps and bounds, the ones who create great businesses, create new products, discover new medicines are predominantly the talented and gifted ones.<p>If we as a nation are making a decision to cut funding to these gifted students, are we at the same time making a decision that jeopardizes the advancement of our society as a whole.?",1323355461

Too many messages, yes, but nothing that endangered the safety of the flight.<p>In the AF447 case, the crew was getting the stall warning.  They did the exact opposite of what you are supposed to do to recover from the stall.  Computers were not the problem.  (The same thing happened to that Colgan Air flight a few years ago.  The crew reacted to the stall warning by stalling the plane even more.  The plane tried to physically force the controls to nose down, which is how you recover from a stall, but the pilots fought it.  Bad UI was not the problem.  Bad flying was.)",1323355199

Mono performance is okay -- we still run a lot of C# utility stuff on Linux with it, no problem (build on windows, push to s3, servers self-deploy).<p>Forget about web stuff though. Mono fastcgi is not production ready (lots of little things, the interplay of nginx and Mono's fastcgi server 'lost' some routes, particularly scriptmethods).<p>Mod_mono is better... until you start getting OutOfMemoryExceptions. My understanding of the problem is that the Boehm GC is non-compacting, and thus, unless you (somehow) craft your application memory use patterns perfectly, will run out of memory if you churn through enough allocations.<p>From the mono ASP.NET FAQ:<p><i>Why does the memory consumed by the Mono process keep growing?<p>Mono currently uses a conservative, non-moving, non-compacting garbage collector. This means that the heap is not compacted when memory is released. This means that applications can produce memory allocation patterns that will effectively make the process grow, just like C, C++, Perl, Python applications would.<p>It is hence important to not get into patterns that would create these holes, for example such a hole could be created if you create a block of size SIZE, release it, and then create two blocks of size SIZE/2+1.<p>ASP.NET in Mono is particularly vulnerable to this kind of memory problems because it is easy for developers to define APIs that transfer large blobs of data like entire image files, these would allocate a lot of memory that can easily be fragmented.<p>A simple solution is to try to write your software in a way that large data blocks are not allocated, but instead your application handles them in blocks (like writing a ""copy"" command).</i><p>So the new GC, S-Gen is available, but for us at least, ~6 months ago it was really buggy. Some of our code would inexplicably cause mono crashes in the allocator. We couldn't run our apps with it, at all.<p>So ultimately we were left with restarting our webserver process every 30 minutes or so, or we could switch back to Windows web servers. Mono was decently performant, but going back to Windows we had a slight but noticable performance increase.<p>Don't get me wrong, Mono is awesome for a lot of things, and it kicks fuckin' ass to run my C# on Linux. But the ASP.NET side of things is just not mature enough. It's possible I'm just a bad programmer and if I'd taken the time to re-architect our allocation patterns to play nice with Boehm this story would have a happier ending, but alas :)<p>P.S.

People will accept longer commutes since they can read, sleep, work, etc. en route leading to further expansion of suburbia.<p>Key message: more people driving more miles for more reasons at lower speeds.<p>Just the idea of owning one car and sending it home for the wife to use is hardly full of win.

A game can be good with mostly just one or the other, albeit quite different experiences, but the best games have both.<p>For example, Tetris has terrible ""graphics"" as such - the thing is entirely abstract, and is almost a pure expression of gameplay. But a game like Skyrim is rather the opposite; it's all about immersing yourself in a role via a character you've created and grown. Meanwhile, the actual tension-creating gameplay mechanics of Skyrim, combat and sneaking, the first is fairly poor, while the second ultimately is overpowered. But those things don't stop it from being a highly enjoyable experience.<p>Why is it a tradeoff? Because building immersion means emulating reality to a greater and greater extent, and that reality gets further and further away from the abstract core of what makes a gameplay mechanic work well, because reality is complicated and has too many details. You have to build the gameplay in such a way that it doesn't break the spell of immersion; instead of being abstract, it has to be made out of simulated reality components.",1323353498

Dragon Warrior II (the worst of the series; enemies tended to gang up on one character and that made it nearly unplayable, esp. with the princess being ungodly weak and dying constantly) is an example of that. It was an expansion on top of Dragon Warrior I, and that expansion was roughly implemented and painful, but the core game concepts of DW 1 remained and it paved the way for DW 3 and 4 (which were among the best NES games) to be made.",1323353282

That being said, I've started steering towards Sinatra more given the minimal startup time and speed.  The biggest gripe I have with Rails is the long startup time.  It's a real drag on test driven development.  Waiting close to 30 seconds per test run while the framework boots really sucks.",1323353273

By the time you run into something your framework can't do, you'll be in a pretty good position to simply extend it. (And Kohana is very easy to modify and extend.)<p>That said, it might take you a bit longer to get going than it'll take you to get going on some other framework that does a better job holding your hand.<p>The way I see it, you're gambling. If you use a better-documented framework, and if the documentation and tutorials out there for it cover everything you want to do in your app, you've got a better chance of hitting your deadline - but if you run into something the framework can't easily handle, you're hosed. While it takes a lot longer to really understand what's going on in your framework, you'll be able to then deal with unexpected problems as they arise.<p>If you do decide on Kohana and have some questions, I'm in NYC and am also a beginner - email me.",1323353233

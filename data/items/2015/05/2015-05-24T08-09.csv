Look at Microsofts recent resurgence, their marketing budget has begun to rival that of Samsung and anecdotally I see their ads everywhere. However ads are not the end all. There are many deciding factors why someone buys a product outside of purely ads, but again ads are a very strong driving force. I don&#x27;t think internet ads are nearly as effective at &#x27;mind-influencing&#x27;(not being sarcastic) as the traditional mediums. I actually click on ads frequently on the web, because I see a product that might interest me. For example, I see an ad for Linode and it presents me a compelling price point so I go and investigate it. hmm I am not entirely sure what I set out to say in this response, but I don&#x27;t think the point that ads are what keeps people poor is very accurate.

Haskell already has inferable (Hindley-Milner) and uninferable (higher-rank polymorphism, GADTs) parts. If we go beyond Haskell&#x27;s type system, it actually becomes crucial for productivity to have powerful type (and term) inference. Agda and Coq both have much more powerful inference than Haskell; it&#x27;s just that don&#x27;t bother with using it to realize Hindley-Milner-style annotation-free bindings, because there&#x27;s little use for it in proof assistants.",1432454552

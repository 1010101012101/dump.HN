You ran Microsoft for 5 years and tried to maximize your profits (or share value).<p>I remember that the best I could do was cut all their product (Word, Excel, Windows, DOS, ?) prices to the bare minimum ($8-20) for a year or two, lock up market share, then jack the prices the $500-1000 range.

I think that this basically deepens the parallel to Google.  When the service works, it's genuinely great - that's part of why they're such a dominant force.  The problem is that when it breaks, generally it breaks in horrid ways.  People like the HN crowd, who are strongly disposed towards trying to do new things that previous models may not account for, are the most likely to find cases where the system breaks, and to suffer the effects of the breakage.",1299776375

If that delta% of the offer that makes up your difference is lower than the value of your time spent doing other things (finding someone else a job), then it doesn't make sense for you to spend the time.<p>That's the basic issue.

I can easily imagine people stressed at large companies that choose startups for better work-family balance (which isn't the same as fewer working hours) that would join a startup just for the family culture.<p>Maybe one reason big companies get slower is that as they age, the young folks start having kids. This translates to less and worse work than before, but the blame is on the company which didn't shift it's culture.

This has already been approved at EU level, and it <i>will</i> therefore become law throughout the EU in due course unless something dramatic happens.

Your goal needs to be to break out of the cycle.<p>What I think you should try is, let the review run, and get your HR-approved comp pellet. Then say,<p>""Thanks for increasing my comp. I appreciate it. I have a question. What were the factors that led you to raise my salary?""<p>They'll give a platitudinous answer. Let them. Then say,<p>""That makes sense. I have another question. Over the past year, I did XXX, YYY, and ZZZ. You didn't mention these things. That's fine! But I'd like to make sure I'm putting my energy into things that the business values here. Instead of XXX, YYY, and ZZZ, what should I do?""<p>Then have the conversation, in specific terms, and <i>follow up with an email recapping the conversation</i>.<p>I have a couple theories about this approach:<p>(1) (Extremely important and something I know to be valid:) Business isn't a meritocracy. The winners know how to market themselves. Coders look over each others shoulders on Github and developer a sense of who the bad-asses are. Successful business people always broadcast their wins.

And one of the people from whom I learned the most about business was also a founder with kids. So, I'm particularly interested in the dynamics of startups and family life.<p>One thing I saw work remarkably well was company culture. You can easily create an inclusive and family-oriented culture: have the whole team be local, do lots of dinners and offsites, have after-dinners work-hours where kids are OK, make sure the families get to know each other.<p>At the first startup I ever worked for, the office was a <i>very</i> large apartment on the north side of Chicago. There was a full kitchen, they cooked dinners, and evening hours were --- at least in the beginning --- of a different character than daylight hours; people worked, but the whole environment was more social, less button-up, and more welcoming.<p>I don't think they really did this on purpose. It was just very friendly and family-oriented group of people. But I can't see a reason why it would be hard to duplicate and extend the idea. Just set an objective, to allow people to routinely work longer hours when necessary while causing minimal strain on families. Then come up with practices that support the objective. I can think of 10 ideas for that off the top of my head. I'm sure you can come up with 20.<p>It's kind of remarkable that so few new companies do this (if they did, they'd be made of stupid not to advertise it).

Hand-written recursion with the operation inlined is not usually very reusable (i.e. composable); however, if you factor out the recursive traversal and parameterize it by the operation to be performed, it composes much better. But at that point you're writing a library routine, rather than logic specific to the task at hand.<p>(As an aside: in my way of thinking about software design, generic library code is ""free"" - it doesn't count towards the number of lines of code for the actual task being solved. I try to make as much of the software that I design library-like, and the core of the app not a lot more than composing these pre-fabricated bits, as possible, potentially even to my detriment in short-term productivity.

AV demonstrates that you're taking steps to reduce the likelihood of you infecting another person's computer. In our experience at Mandalorian, Antivirus has roughly a 20-40% success rate at stopping malware. That's a wide margin, but still the wrong side of 50%. To put things into perspective, in the past several hundred penetration tests, there has not been one where the AV stopped our attack, subsequent compromise or persistence mechanisms. Let me clarify:<p>In the past 18 months the total number of simulated attacks by us on customer engagements that have been stopped by Antivirus is: 0.<p>I'm fairly confident that we've never had an AV stop us, but I don't have data going that far back. Now if that's what a commercial penetration testing outfit can do, what can governments do?<p>There's no real such thing as 'state malware' per se (well there is, but I'll come to that in a minute). When defending against state level attack you need to understand your adversary and their capabilities. A government attacking you or another government is not a technology, it's a threat group. They will have a specific goal in mind and it's up to you to identify it and defend accordingly.<p>Now assume that to develop something like Stuxnet is expensive. A government is going to require a lot of resources to create ordinance to use in these attacks. They'll start with things like metasploit because if they can get in with that they don't risk blowing their own code. Then you'll start seeing zero day exploits, botnet toolkits and more before you start seeing specifically developed targeted code.<p>The reason is simple - it takes months to develop the attack and the exploits and persistence are a massive part of that. If you can detect it, block it and share the indicators, that work is now burnt.<p>Antivirus vendors are not targeting that space (or if they are, they won't win - unless they're receiving the indicators of compromise, also known as IoCs).",1299773431

Today, middle schools is ~3 years, high school is 4 years, university is 4 years, etc.; we discretize learning into these rigid chunks of time - partially out of (deprecated) technical necessity - and in the process we isolate kids - the so called dumb kids.  When Kahn showed that graph of a so called <i>dumb</i> kids spending 2-3x as long on a single topic, only to resume the same learning rate as the <i>smart</i> kids after they understood the foundational concept they were originally struggling with, it made me see how much potential there truly is in this system.<p>Imagine a world where the baseline level of education is produced by a Khan style system.  Schooling wouldn't be as tractable (i.e., it might take 2 to 6 (or more) years to go through high school instead of a nice predictable 4), but everyone that would come out of said system would have the same (ideal) level of knowledge needed in order to move on to the next best thing (e.g., college, work, life's passion, etc.).  There wouldn't be kids competing for GPA's or stuffing their resumes, and there wouldn't be kids who didn't know how to tie their shoes; there would be kids who KNOW calculus, kids who UNDERSTAND physics, and kids who GET American history.  The variation would be in the idiosyncrasies of the topics, as opposed to the core concepts.<p>Now imagine further to what this does for higher education.  In this proposed system, it would simply be a fact that graduating kids would know - at mastery level - what their school's curriculums listed off; it's the equivalent of everyone having a 1600 on their SAT's.  College acceptance becomes less of a selectivity problem, and more of an efficiency problem; where are all these geniuses going to study!<p>Ahhh, the potential is so exciting...<p>That being said, as sort of an aside I think it's noteworthy to say that the idea of fixing the tuition-based University model is a bit more complex than the high school model, but as user arjn said bellow, there are plenty of free lecture repositories out there already; perhaps if prior educational systems encouraged and indoctrinated students to be more self-proficient (as in the Khan system), University learning becomes more about educating yourself, and those free lectures will (naturally) replace the pay-to-learn model.

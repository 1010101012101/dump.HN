To quote from the article again:<p><i>During our tests, we saw that SQL databases werent a good fit due to the fact that our data where unstructured and we needed a lot of complex joins (and many indexes).</i><p>I guess that you say it's unstructured because the most important parts of bug reports are stack traces and debug messages? My naive assumption is that stack traces can be stored in a relational way, and it seems that you do:<p><i>For us, relations might seem to resemble these of an RDBMS at first sight, but we work with them in a different way.</i><p>From 'unstructured', 'complex ""joins""' and 'work in a different way' I infer that you do a lot of string processing on the fly, and the real problem was about precomputing everything vs. staying flexible?",1354013868

Her job consisted of answering emails here and there between bickering faculty members or administrators in order to run interference before these emails reached the President or one of the Provosts (of which there were I think 13) and wasted their supposedly valuable time. She would also coordinate administrator/faculty ""delegations"" to other Universities abroad -- basically the president of our university and rich alumni going various countries pretending they were foreign dignitaries and signing various ""memorandums of understanding"" with similar individuals at other universities.  This mainly involved getting her unpaid interns (or, members of her ""Leadership Program"", as she liked to call it) to create huge binders of useless information (basically printing out Wikipedia articles).  From what I heard, the new President of our university has asked for these binders to be discontinued because they seemed like a waste of time and paper.  Other than the binders (which she neither created nor read), she would have her assistants, who were making a few bucks above minimum wage, call and speak with the travel agents and party planners who would actually do the work of planning these engagements.  She would also, of course, accompany the delegations at the university's expense to make sure everything was ""running smoothly.""  Thus, the job of entertaining rich Alumni was delegated by the President to the Vice Provost for International Affairs, who then delegated it to her, who then delegated it to her poorly-paid assistants and unpaid interns.  For this, the ""Assistant to the Vice Provost for International Affairs"" made 125,000 dollars a year, while the Vice Provost for International Affairs made $165,000 -- fully documented by the state for anyone who cares to see.",1354013144

In fact, I am of the opinion that much of the absolute and utter failure of so-called software engineering to deliver meaningful improvements in programmer productivity has been due to its repeated failed attempts to apply engineering discipline to what is essentially a craft problem. After all, we don't have ""wood engineering"" for carpenters and cabinetmakers. We don't have ""fabric engineering"" for tailors and dressmakers. Engineering principles are designed to solve known problems in a reliable and repeatable manner. We understand that cabinetmakers and dressmakers don't deal with the same problems (or necessarily even the same sort of problem) day in and day out. That's why we don't apply engineering principles to those positions. So why do we insist on applying engineering principles to programming?<p><i>Designers aren't asked to come paint a house. Accountants aren't asked for stock tips. Someday, programmers won't be asked antivirus questions anymore.</i><p>Those are bad analogies.

4836497,comment,4836069,4836428,15,0,tolmasky,,,"<i>> what is the reason why these organic-seeming movements can be modeled mathematically, specifically with trigonometric functions?</i><p>Any motion can be modeled mathematically. There are probably infinite equations that provide ""organic looking motion"". I could make one that made really good looking motion but was really long and complex and you could have a parallel person asking ""why is nature so messy and not giving us simple motion?"". The insight here is to not attach any special significance just because ""it looks organic"". In reality what we are probably saying is that it ""looks smooth"". (In fact you could look at Bezier curves which are often used for animations to see non-trigonemtric examples, which while easy to define are relatively complex to actually run through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzier_curve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzier_curve</a> . All of iOS's built-in famous smooth animations use these.)<p>So let's break these down. All of these examples are periodic. So for starters we need a good periodic function. We could have started with y = |(x%2) - 1| ( <a href=""http://tolmasky.com/letmeshowyou/notsmooth.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tolmasky.com/letmeshowyou/notsmooth.png</a> ). That would give us the back and forth motion we want, but would have <i>not looked smooth</i>, since we linearly increase, then linearly decrease, and in the middle abruptly change. Your eye would catch that abruptness and that's what would give it the ""inorganic feel"" (despite the fact that there are plenty of things in biology that are super abrupt).<p>So what we want instead is the same kind of back and forth, but rounding off the edges. You could imagine forming a function by taking a normal parabola (y=x^2) and an inverted one (y=-x^2), and putting them together to get the rounded bottom and top corners ( <a href=""http://tolmasky.com/letmeshowyou/twoparabolas.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tolmasky.com/letmeshowyou/twoparabolas.png</a> ).<p>Luckily for us, we've already discovered a class of functions that give us something similar in the form of sine and cosine. Now, the reason <i>why</i> these are smooth and periodic is simply because the values of these functions are derived from tracing along a circle ( <a href=""http://www.galaxygoo.org/math/sineCurve.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.galaxygoo.org/math/sineCurve.html</a> ). Now that you know this, you have a ""tool"" for your mathematical bag of tricks: every time you want to do something smooth and periodic, you are probably going to reach for sine or cosine. Similarly, if you want to now tweak this and have things ramp up in speed or down, you could try using exponents, etc.<p>Hopefully this sheds a little light on what's going on here.",1354011337

Javascript was a non-portable hack that was only to be touched in the most extreme circumstances. Websites that didn't work on Lynx were reviled. Oh how things have changed, and yet have stayed the same at that same time (i.e., your 'welcome to 1990' comment).<p>On a related note, the last couple of weeks I've been working on rewriting an old (2000-era) web app, originally written in Visual Interdev. Visual Interdev was widely derided back then, it was something only Visual Basic 'programmers' (the chaff of the programming community) would touch. Turns out that many things it did are a lot more popular nowadays - client side calculations, validation, dynamically updating the UI, etc. Of course there was no XMLHttpRequest, so by modern standards it was quite limited; still, it's funny how something so derided back then just turned out to be ahead of its time.",1354010994

Welcome to 1990, everyone!<p>More seriously, though, I think a lot of the reason for the historical tendency towards server side rendering has been:<p>* Clients were slow: remember, until V8 raised the standard for speed, Javascript VMs were <i>slow</i>. So doing a lot of rendering or data processing in Javascript was a bad idea, since it negatively affected the user's experience with their entire computer, not just your site.<p>* DOM Manipulation is hard and inconsistent between browsers: Yes, JQuery and friends hide the native DOM API. But we have to remember that it wasn't always the case. Rich client-side libraries are all quite young, comparitively.<p>* Offline capabilites were non-existent: Even today, the HTML5 specification, as implemented, only grants you a fraction of the data storage and retrieval capabilities available to even the most sandboxed application. And previously, these capabilities simply weren't there - if your app needed to store data, it had to store data server side and tag the client with a cookie or some other for identification to keep track of which data belonged to whom.<p>Yes, there is progress being made on all three fronts, but you can't expect developers to throw away years of best practices in a day, then immediately turn around and write HTML5 webapps. I think the evolution towards a more balanced computing model (where more of the computational load is being handled by the client) is ongoing, and will accelerate as browsers become more capable.",1354010527

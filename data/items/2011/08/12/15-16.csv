Some will even sometimes try taking you and/or the payment processor to court.

I've been on Adderall (XR) at dosages up to 80mg, Strattera, Wellbutrin XL + 10mg Adderall (actually my favorite, but not so effective), and now I'm on Concerta (Ritalin) 27mg/54mg.<p>The 27mg dose of Concerta is minimally effective without affecting my sleep, so sometimes I need to boost it.  I hate stimulants though, and I wish I could get along fine without them but it's just not possible.  Strattera worked good but the ""sexual side effects"" were too weird for me to continue on.  Wellbutrin + Adderall worked okay (with the benefit of me generally being a bit happier) but my psychiatrist after moving didn't want me on two medicines that can raise your blood pressure.<p>I ended up going to 6 different schools between 8th grade and graduating across 4 different cities.  Despite that, I graduated high school with a 3.5 and started college as a Sophomore.  My first semester in college I got a 1.8 and thrown in academic suspension.  The next three years would be really rough.  After that, I went to my family doctor and got adderall, and that helped out a lot at first, but it wasn't a miracle drug and I still had to really force myself to concentrate in weird ways to get through school, and that's really where the adderall helped.  Towards the end, school got easier and I enjoyed it more, but I could also sit down and do homework.<p>I've gone off meds completely for a few months at a time almost once a year, and I just can't do it.  I wish I would have been diagnosed with it as a kid and had the behavioral therapy along with it instead of having to wing it for the past 6 years, but that's in the past.

2877731,comment,2877100,2877100,10,0,mcantor,,,"I'm 26, and I was diagnosed with ADD last year, at the suggestion of my dad, who was not diagnosed until his 40's.  It took me almost a year to start actively researching ADD, because I grew up in an upper-middle-class community where it was primarily over-diagnosed in unmotivated kids whose parents were convinced that brain dysfunction was the only thing that could <i>possibly</i> keep their children from being A students.  To say the very least, I was skeptical.<p>When I finally began learning about ADD, I was startled by how standard my story was.  Reading <i>Driven To Distraction</i> was a watershed experience for me; at times I was convinced that they had simply copy-and-pasted my academic transcript: ""<i>Dreamer</i>,"" ""<i>Has a creative mind that would produce incredible results if he applied himself once in a while</i>,"" ""<i>Inconsistent. What happened to the A student sitting in my classroom last year?</i>""<p>In perspective, so much suddenly made sense; not just my experiences in high school, but beyond that as well.  I failed only one class in my entire academic career, a programming course in my second year of college.  How ironic and confusing that my only failure would be in the subject for which I had the most passion.  Now it made sense.  Only two or three years ago from today, I almost lost my job because my output was so inconsistent.  I barely scraped by and recovered, but the experience shook me.  Now, I understood.<p>There are many forms of treatment, all of which I have experimented with.  When it comes to medication, it took me a long time to settle on Adderall, which lets me focus like a normal person without any appreciable side-effects.  The drug was a game-changer for me, like the first time I put on glasses.<p>I think I'm glad that I wasn't medicated as a kid, if only because of a deep uncertainty about medicating something as malleable as a child's brain.  Conversely, going 25 years without diagnosis has also drastically affected every part of my life.  (I have no idea how my dad dealt with it for almost 50 years.)  This was also something that I grew to understand as I learned more about ADD; undiagnosed, it can lead to perennial struggles with depression, self-esteem, poor impulse control and a host of others.  I think the most important thing about ADD isn't necessarily medication or even ""treatment"" but simply <i>awareness</i>.<p>""Laziness"" is a symptom, not a root cause.  If we can be mindful about the signs of ADD in childhood, we have already taken a huge step towards improving the quality of life for people with the disorder, and everyone they interact with.

Fortunately, there is a healthy diversity in people's views on that issue just as with many other issues. Thus, in practice, we have always had European integration on several different levels depending on the individual needs of the nations involved and their collective benefit from co-operation.<p>Today, being in the EU is not the same as using the Euro. Though the Lisbon Treaty blurred a lot of lines, we historically had the European Courts of Justice rather separate from the European Union as well. There is a lot more historical detail on Wikipedia's page on the EU if you're interested.<p>If anyone thinks Europe will still look the same in five years, I think they are probably missing something, given the obvious differences in financial power between say Germany and Greece today and the obvious negative effects it is having on the better off nations. Who knows the consequences at this stage? Maybe the result will be closer integration where the financial policies of the weaker nations are restricted by the stronger nations who support them. Maybe Europe will fracture as an economic community but perhaps continue as a legal, diplomatic, free trade, and/or military one.

I have three thoughts that might help you determine how valuable it is for you:<p>As an Electrical Engineering student, I find that I also enjoy coding. Developing a program is similar in many ways to developing an embedded system.  My experience in the design process helps greatly in both areas, and I feel that I'm just as productive, if not more productive, than my CS counterparts.  In fact, I'm currently writing C++ desktop apps in an internship.  These apps interface with external hardware, where my EE skills come into play.  My education has helped me to do this job, and I'm at least as good at it as someone who had no skill with hardware.  If your academic branch is related to design, math, science, or the market you wish to enter, then it's a perfectly fine discipline for you to be in.<p>If you don't have familiarity with a CS department at your school, you should be aware that computer science in its pure sense is very different from working in a programming industry.  You don't necessarily have to touch a keyboard at all to do computer science; it's basically a discipline of mathematics.  However, some schools have a CS department which is designed to prepare you for industry, which can't really be called computer science.  A traditional CS degree isn't the ideal preparation for entry to industry.<p>Now, if you were a student in an academic branch completely unrelated to the industry you want to enter, it might be hard to find sufficient value to justify the degree.  You'd have to approach it from a ""learning how to learn"" or ""wholistic education"" standpoint.",1313161585

For example, one talks about the ""housing bubble"" in China (currently a big problem there). What this means (in layman's terms, which is how I understand complicated economic stuff like this) is that the value of something has gone way up than normal due to some factor, which may or may not be artificial manipulation (since price of something is dynamically determined, the meaning of ""higher than normal"" is a bit complex).<p>Now, in the case of incubators, they report that there's a 3x increase 2 years. This may be healthy development filling a need or it may that there are a lot unnecessary incubators. You can't tell at this stage, since the optimum number of incubators determined by market conditions is hard to tell.<p>The more you think about the harder it seems to judge the success of incubators, but in the end it comes down to money earned: how much it invested - values of current holdings is one simple way of doing it, I think (although this doesn't take into account other criteria, such as attracting companies to a region, which may important for some incubators).",1313161500

Maybe we should have two different words to distinguish the two, but we don't, and that's the way the word is used.  A racial-ethnic group is a group up people who share characteristics of lineage, culture, dialect, mores, norms, etc.  Obviously, all talk of ethnic characteristics will be unfortunately general.  Not every Italian likes espresso, not every American-urban-black person likes fried chicken, etc.<p>I think it is a very well supported statement to say that the ""american-black-ethnic-group"" that moved north into Detroit had levels of crime that the prior residents of Detroit found quite disturbing.  And a major proportion of this crime was directed at white people in a racially charged manner.  That is not to say that violence is an indelible attribute of all black ethnic groups, at all times, and all places.  But high rates of violence was a property of this particular ethnic group, at this time, at this place.  The movement of this ethnic group into the city, and the interactions of this ethnic group with other ethnic groups in the city, is important for understanding what happened.  The Detroit story is partly a story of an ethnic-sectarian conflict, just as in Kosovo, Israel, post-bellum Atlanta, or innumerable other times and places in history.<p>What are the practical reasons is it important to recognize and talk about the ethnic nature of the conflict?  I can think of a couple:<p>a) The current conventional wisdom (that I learned in college) was that white flight was due to an irrational and bigoted revulsion of black people.  Thus the solution to preventing future white is to re-educate white people to make them not racist.  The actual story, I think, is that white flight was a result of ethnic violence.  White people feared black people moving into their neighborhood, because they had the quite rational and well-supported belief that this would dramatically increase the probability of black-on-white ethnic violence.  The solution, then, is to take the same techniques of law enforcement and re-education that were used with tremendous success to reduce white-on-black ethnic violence and white-on-black racism, and use those techniques to reduce black-on-white racism and black-on-white violence.<p>b) If you are governing a city or a country that's experiencing a large influx of ethnic migration, and that ethnic group has cultural patterns that are causing problems, you need to work on strengthening your institutions to handle that influx.

Presumably how someone subjectively feels is an important part of quality of life, not just objective things like their income levels and job security; someone who's really good at school but doesn't like themselves anymore isn't exactly having a high quality of life.<p>I'm not particularly up on ADHD research, but in antidepressant research this is now widely taken seriously, that the goal of antidepressants has to include improvement in subjective wellbeing, not solely reduction in suicide risk. Even if you don't care about subjective assessments (which, increasingly, psychiatrists do), there's also the practical reason that patients who don't like what a particular drug does to their personality are much less likely to continue using it as prescribed, making it important to find a match that the patient is comfortable with the effects of (unfortunately that's still mostly trial-and-error, because the effects of drugs vary a lot between individuals in thus-far poorly understood ways).<p>[Fwiw, I don't personally care much about a mystical ""my real self"", but I do think psychoactive chemicals can change one's personality---in fact that's almost definitionally what they do, to the extent that ""personality"" is just the aggregate of how the brain works---and that some changes can be ones I like living with, and others can be ones I don't like, so I'd prefer not to take drugs that change my personality in ways where I don't like the result.]",1313161268

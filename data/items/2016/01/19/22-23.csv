In short, you can now get a REPL into <i>any</i> Clojure app by passing a flag on startup. Previously you would have had to manually start a REPL server during app startup.",1453244384

My take on your questions:<p>- Look at their portfolios, make judgment calls about which ones do the best work, narrow it down to a short list. I would then have a brief chat/exchange with the short list members to try to learn a bit about their process. My goal here is to evaluate whether I think this person is thoughtful about what they are doing, can communicate sufficiently, and can mostly direct themselves. (If I knew exactly what I wanted I wouldn&#x27;t be hiring a designer.) After this, if you want to be extra cautious, you could ask for a few references. But for your budget, if the previous steps check out I would probably just skip that step.<p>- I think your approach of posting a job for bidding is probably not best although I haven&#x27;t tried this myself and not familiar with that subreddit. You want to pre-select the quality designers who are likely in demand already.<p>- Your budget is pretty low for all the items you listed. At that price range for all the things you want, you&#x27;re probably going to be limiting yourself to people who can&#x27;t improve what you currently have in a major way without direction from you.<p>- My approach when I tried this recently was to go on dribbble, check out shots of the thing I was looking for (in my case logos - in your case landing pages), and make a list of great designers who had a lot of examples of what I wanted.<p>Some more feedback:<p>- Why change the logo? What you have right now is great A+.<p>- Fonts and color scheme are not great but probably not that important right now.<p>- If you hire a designer, focus on someone who specifically has experience building great landing pages.<p>- The problem with your landing page is the visual clarity and messaging of explaining the value prop to the user. Right now it&#x27;s somewhat visually overwhelming due to lots of text, moving things, poor job of creating contrast between sections and call outs. I&#x27;m not sure where my eyes should look when I hit the page. Copy, ie the wording, could improve also.<p>- Design is not as hard as you think. You can probably get 75% as good a the result as a pro designer by spending two afternoons studying examples of other well designed landing pages and paying attention to details of what they did, then applying it yourself. You will learn a lot in the process too.<p>HTH, feel free to ping me at hnusername[0:4] @ u [windy city] edu.",1453243930

The compiler would crash when code wasn&#x27;t correct. The error messages were terrible. The language had was missing essential parts. Apple had to do a lot of fixing to get to where we are now. The things they have fixed has been a lot more important to get right than the refactoring support. Crash free IDE, good error messages, stable compiler, user friendly handling of optional types has been far more important IMHO. But now the language is looking good, so I think starting with Swift 3.0 I think we will start to see xCode getting fixed.<p>It might also be intentional to give a marked to AppCode and others. xCode has always been pretty slim in the offerings when it comes to refactoring.

The purpose of the type system is to ensure that certain undesired behaviors do not occur when we execute the program. For example, adding a number to a string, calling non-existing method in an object, and so on. From this point of view, a type system adds static guarantees to your program (certain classes of bugs never happen, the editor has an easier time doing autocomplete, etc) at the cost of increased complexity and learning curve (you need to learn the type system in addition to the runtime semantics) and decreased flexibility (every type system inevitably disallows some programs that would not have resulted in one of the undesired behaviors had you just had faith and ran everything).<p>I also think it helps to see static typing as a spectrum. For example, most languages only detect division by zero and index-out-of-bounds errors at runtime. Dependently-typed type systems can be used to guarantee that errors like these do not happen at runtime but they are much harder to learn (lots of advanced type theory is involved) and use (you need to do a lot more work to appease the type system)<p>^1 - A notable exception are language that use type-based name overloading. But if you &quot;desugar&quot; the overloading then the styatic types are usually eraseable at runtime.",1453243471

From what I&#x27;m come to understand from the overly bureaucratical responses I received from JavaScript community members, is that the language is designed with two intentions in mind:<p>1. Never break legacy code.\n2. Be an open adaptable language that any developer from any background (or no background) can write code in.<p>It&#x27;s a messy messy attempt at being the popular kid. For example, classes, a popular new feature of ES6 looks like this:<p>~~~<p>class Hello {<p><pre><code>  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name\n  }\n\n  hello() {\n    return &#x27;Hello &#x27; + this.name + &#x27;!&#x27;\n  }</code></pre>\n}<p>~~~<p>Cool. However in ES5, this is how a class is created:<p>~~~<p>function Hello(name) {\n  this.name = name\n}<p>Hello.prototype.hello = function hello() {\n  return &#x27;Hello &#x27; + this.name + &#x27;!&#x27;\n}<p>~~~<p>Okay...this makes sense and while the ES6 version is syntactically cleaner, it breaks the paradigm set in ES5. Knowing what I know of other languages, I&#x27;d expect something like this:<p>~~~<p>class Hello {<p><pre><code>  function constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name\n  }\n\n  function hello() {\n    return &#x27;Hello &#x27; + this.name + &#x27;!&#x27;\n  }</code></pre>\n}<p>~~~<p>I was told the reason is that methods are not functions. Which is an okay reason, but wait, they are functions in ES5...<p>Furthermore, you can&#x27;t use ES6 class syntax in non strict mode. At first I assumed a valiant attempt of deprecating older features, by requiring a strict mode as a sort of psuedo deprecation. However what stinks about this is that it still doesn&#x27;t fix the issue 100%. There are already too many tutorials out there describing how to write bad JS code. What ultimately needs to happen, is that browsers, nodejs, etc, need to always operate with strict parsing. The &quot;use strict&quot; flag is too easily forgotten. Yes this will break programs that are 50 years old, but everything has to come to a halt eventually. Another solution would be to &quot;fork&quot; or start a new language from scratch to replace it. I&#x27;m aware this is the intention of Dart, however it&#x27;s adoption rate seems too little to make an impact as evidence by it&#x27;s lack of care to be included in Chrome even (<a href=""https://www.dartlang.org/support/faq.html#q-will-the-dart-vm-get-into-chrome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dartlang.org/support/faq.html#q-will-the-dart-vm...</a>).",1453243282

Note that an accountant (taxes) and a financial advisor (investments) are very different.<p>Personally, I have an accountant for navigating tax returns, but I do not have a financial advisor, as I prefer to manage my own investments and holdings. I used to have one, but found it unnecessary after I taught myself more about investing and trading.<p>If you are in the NYC area and don&#x27;t mind a ~40 minute drive on the Taconic once or twice a year, I can recommend a good accountant for you. You can stay fully anonymous with me personally if you want, just email me anonymously.<p>For more general advice - you usually want to find such services through a referral. Even if none of your friends have had this happen to them, you will probably have folks tied to your company who can help. Try the founders of your company, or the investors. They&#x27;ll likely have good direction for you.<p>I do recommend that you find someone who is willing to be educational and welcomes a collaborative partnership instead of someone who will just tell you what to do without explaining the benefits of various courses of action. If you decide to get a financial advisor, try to find one who will charge a flat fee.<p>As far as questions go - ask your accountant what experience they have with liquidity events and varying streams of income. You want an accountant who is comfortable helping folks that aren&#x27;t just filing traditional tax returns with one source of full-time income.<p>For financial advisors, the single best question I have is about returns. Ask potential advisors what returns you can expect through them. If they guarantee a specific return, don&#x27;t work with them. If they guarantee a return that beats the S&P 500, also don&#x27;t work with them.<p>Good luck.",1453243233

Does it hurt their ability to do their jobs? Do they feel they are treated fairly?<p>The way that you have worded that scenario makes me think that nobody in the organization knew about the relationship before the wedding. In that case, I would likely want to fire the manager, though I can see how that could open up a metric shit ton of litigation, so I may not get my wish.<p>If I couldn&#x27;t outright terminate the manager, at minimum, I would make sure that he/she was no longer his/her spouse&#x27;s direct manager.

It might be okay to inspect the state the layer below for performance reasons, but no further.<p>That means that a well done Rails app might want to inquire about the state of HTTP, but shouldn&#x27;t inquire about IP addresses. And it might want to know about indexes on its databases, but not disk caching policies or i/o schedulers.<p>So the case of &quot;too much magic&quot; is not to become used to the discomfort of not understanding how underlying abstractions work, nor is it to stop using them. Instead you want to choose dependencies with well documented abstractions, implemented such that you can inspect if you need to.<p>This has nothing to do with Rails specifically. I see plenty of coworkers who dislike Django&#x27;s large set of features, as too much bloat, or too much magic they don&#x27;t understand. Instead of reading documentation, and becoming expert in Django&#x27;s abstractions, they spin up Flask apps, slowly reinventing the wheels, but maybe not quite as round.",1453242442

In any published library, this means backward compatibility is completely broken and everyone else&#x27;s code needs to change.<p>Notice I said you avoid exporting the <i>value</i> constructors. You&#x27;re still free to export or not export the data type itself as you wish, allowing users to reference the type in type annotations while still not letting them ever construct their own value of the type except through helper functions.<p>This achieves even better modularity, because then in the implementation file, you can change what happens with the <i>value</i> constructors however you want, and you can service backward compatibility to your heart&#x27;s content without ever requiring the <i>users</i> of the data type to even be aware that anything is changing.<p>Maybe you are referring to something else, but I am referring to data type and value constructors in Haskell. The data type itself is a distinct semantic construct in Haskell from the constructors of values of that data type, and they can have different privacy properties.<p>> I almost never see this.<p>Well, I&#x27;ve seen it over and over in production critical code in three different organizations ... so our anecdotes disagree.<p>> Humans are still required to provide type information, which means they can still make errors. Even better, correcting these errors often affects the interface at call sites, which means the fix has to break backward compatibility.<p>It depends on the language. In Haskell for example, you could just make a type union, one for allowing passage of the old-style interface and one for the new, corrected version. It&#x27;s very easy to do, still has the upsides of type checking, and doesn&#x27;t break backward compatibility.<p>> You were not reasoning correctly about your code. Proper testing should have been your safety net,<p>Except you missed the relevant test case, whereas a tool like QuickCheck would have had a better shot at discovering a corner case that humans couldn&#x27;t have anticipated.<p>> It sounds to me like you got started in Python, and are identifying beginner&#x27;s mistakes with the language itself.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re referring to. The code I was working with was written by a mix of many Python developers. Some were core committers to the Python language itself; some were data analysts who didn&#x27;t want to be programming.<p>I can say that I haven&#x27;t had significant front-end experience in Python. But I&#x27;ve touched a lot of most other major areas, particularly in very low-level NumPy code, LLVM stuff with both Numba and llvmlite, pandas, Excel tools, and many different database technologies and ORMs.<p>I will say though, that in the projects where we switched from pure Python over to statically-typed Cython, it cleared up tons and tons of our issues, many of them almost over night.<p>Rather than me finding beginner mistakes in Python, it seems to me like you worked on one single system that suffered a lot of issues with backward compatibility, and you&#x27;re generalizing that backward compatibility experience to other areas where you&#x27;re less familiar (like solving the same backward compatibility stuff in Haskell).",1453241784

But that&#x27;s obviously not even close to being true. The really annoying bugs that type systems prevent are far more insidious than that. For example Python will happily let you use the greater-than operator on an int and a function. So if you accidentally write `f < 10` instead of `f() < 10`, you will not get a type error, but your program will have a bug that manifests in your program logic going wrong and leading to wrong results somewhere down the line.<p>I&#x27;ve analysed all bug tickets for a Python system at a previous job for several months, tracking how many of our bugs would have been prevented by a Haskell-style type system.

In more functional languages like Haskell, i feel like i am not as productive (mostly because i still don&#x27;t quite understand it yet). In elixir, it feels like i&#x27;m building javascript or python, just in a more functional way. Seriously, give it a shot guys.",1453240884

I&#x27;m saying that&#x27;s just &quot;non-optimized&quot; vs &quot;very likely non-optimized&quot;, so multi-tier JIT shouldn&#x27;t affect much of the unittest runs.<p>Even following that logic about JIT vs AOT in a single run, the python vs v8 equivalent would be that: you have non-optimized code vs non-optimized code which still has to keep track of execution counters, therefore the one without counters should be faster.<p>Regarding unittesting Go vs V8... I&#x27;d really like to see a big project where it could be compared - unfortunately that&#x27;s not realistic.",1453240848

They knew that the machines would never agree what time &quot;now&quot; is so all interactions contain time stamps from both parties.<p>If you want to know what time the server has right now, you can get it from the Response headers on your last communication (i.e., often the one you&#x27;re decoding right now).  If the server says this reply expires at noon but you think it&#x27;s 1:15 already, you can sort out that the server really means &quot;five minutes from now&quot; and is 1:20 <i>behind</i> of you for some reason.<p>I&#x27;m starting to think at a properly constructed time library should contain local and remote time instead of trying to find an objective truth.  It&#x27;s too easy to transpose.<p>[edit: even I invert my clock skews from time to time.]",1453240843

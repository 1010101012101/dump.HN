In this market, I think you need to be looking for a ""techie"" partner, more than an employee that likes your ""dress code"".<p>And on a personal note, I think of a ""techie"" as the guy who sets up the printers and unboxes the new LCD monitors... we are ""geeks"" or ""coders"" - IMHO",1191689192
64092,comment,64034,64077,0,0,cperciva,,,"""you can still have the case that the web 2.0 apps are much more interesting than the CS concepts on which they are based""<p>Which is more interesting, opera or football?  Personally, I'm interested in opera -- and Computer Science -- but I'm willing to accept that most people find football (and web 2.0 applications) to be far more interesting.<p>But you thinking that Computer Science is boring doesn't imply that Computer Science is analogous to studying pens any more than me thinking that football is boring implies that football is analogous to the mating behaviour of male elk.  In both cases there is similarity at first glance --  Computer Science courses tend to focus on very simple and well-understood algorithms (quicksort, binary search, minimal spanning tree, etc.), while to someone without understanding of tactics, football appears to be nothing more than a bunch of large males running at and into each other -- but if you take the time to understand either of these you'll see that the analogies fail quite quickly.\n",1191689189

64090,comment,63830,63839,0,0,breck,,,"Indeed, the ramifications of this breakthrough are much larger than fighting climate change. An editor from the Guardian told me: ""these new life forms can also fight terrorism, drunk driving and The Others.""<p>When I asked if this development had any relevance in areas other than cliche current event subjects, he said ""Absolutely. Since we know have an answer to where life comes from--the lab--humans won't have to waste all that time with existential talk and can spend more time  reading the Global Warming and terrorism stories in our great news media.""",1191688953

I was too young to do much though, mainly just play a spelling game.<p>My introduction to hacking was in 1992 when my dad purchased a 486DX2 PC. I was writing batch file menus in DOS to load files, etc. It didn't take very long before I started trying to overclock it and stuff. <p>Looking back on it, I'm very surprised my dad trusted me to mess around with his computers like that, given how much they cost back then... Honestly, I dont think he had a clue as to what I was doing. But I'm grateful at the same time as I learned a lot. I think kids need that freedom to experiment when it comes to hacking.",1191688293

For example, Google seems to use Python & Java a lot, so if your application is built in Lisp or  .NET, how big of a role will that play during negotiations?<p>I'm interested in hearing how this scenario is usually handled and if that has ever affected an acquisition?",1191688046

64076,comment,63617,63986,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Wow!<p>I'm flattered that someone took the time to go through my comment history.  My web presence is currently limited to my forum user's accounts at news.YC, TechCrunch, and the like.  The idea of a blog occurred to me briefly when we decided to start looking at consumer startups.  However, we determined there to be many blogs already in existence doing an excellent job of providing coverage of the space.  It was doubtful that we would create a large enough audience from which to select clients.<p>All that said, the idea of a personal blog has been pitched to me.  Recently the requests have been coming more and more often.  So perhaps at some point in the future.  Right now I am so busy that I am staying in touch with the office on the weekends.  I would like to actually put thought into blog posts for a personal blog, and not have it be these more off-the-cuff brainstorms that I post to the forums.<p>Thanks again for the interest.\n",1191686728

If it uses DNA, RNA and amino acids, it is just a variation on the same 4 billion year old theme. <p>These proteins would not be ""created"" their structure would almost certainly be evolved computationally. That would be enormously useful. And it would be damned cool.<p>But, I think true artificial life simply must be made out of something else.",1191686553

8480238,comment,8479993,8479993,0,0,namocat,,,"After deeming the academic science career path too exploitative and fraught with landmines, I decided I wanted to being a transition into the tech industry as a software engineer.  Only trouble was... I didn&#x27;t have any of the necessary modern web development skills to actually get hired and it would have probably taken me over a year working &#x27;on the side&#x27; to gain them.  Having just completed a PhD, I was not in the state where I could have justified going BACK to school for a masters in computer science either. So for my level of experience, place in life, and motivation, the coding bootcamp I attended (Hack Reactor) was the best thing I could have ever hoped for.  I worked hard during the program and got a great job as a software engineer only a couple weeks after graduating the program and have been happily employed in my new role for ~7 months so far.<p>I&#x27;m torn on this issue though, because even though I feel that Hack Reactor was worth every penny, I can acknowledge that the &quot;coding bootcamp&quot; space could potentially be littered with shysters and people trying to make a quick buck, taking advantage of students by promoting false hiring stats.  I&#x27;d welcome for a light to be shined on those programs, but would lament if Hack Reactor specifically gets thrown under the bus or that the tech industry sours on grads of good schools like Hack Reactor because they are labeled as simply &quot;bootcamp grads&quot;.",1413766724

I have a high-end receiver and a high-quality mini-DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter.  If I plug these together, iTunes hangs (sometimes requiring a reboot of the entire Macbook!) when I start playing a movie I paid for, seemingly because of the DRM lockdown bullshit.  I then have to connect the HDMI cable to the TV directly, which prevents true surround sound from working (because most TVs cannot output AC3, only stereo).<p>All this happens despite all my equipment being about the same age (2-3 years).

8480196,comment,8476120,8479954,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Well, clearly Whitney has been hugely successful with his odd little language.<p>There&#x27;s the case for a kind of extreme pragmatism — writing code that does the one thing it needs to do, without particular concerns for things like abstraction.<p>We all write one-off scripts that are short and precise, but for a myriad of reasons won&#x27;t scale to anything bigger or more general: we cheat and use global variables; we target one specific use case but don&#x27;t allow parametization/configuration to support others; we target one OS and a certain constellation of dependencies; and so on.<p>What Whitney has accomplished, I suspect, is that he has found a way to reduce the problem surface by going for extreme simplicity in absolutely all areas of his system, which is by making certain assumptions. Everything is lists or simple data types,  there are no abstractions (by which I mean things like interfaces, generics, abstract data types, even custom types), almost everything is in-memory.<p>You can do this with a Lisp or a Scheme, too. But the temptation is always to reach out for abstractions and patterns and build complicated systems out of subsystems. A database would have a cache manager, a page manager, a planner, an index manager, an SQL parser, a transaction log manager, etc. etc.<p>K shows that you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> go for this clean, compartmentalized, layered subsystem approach if the whole program is small enough to make it easy to see the whole system on the screen. You can use global variables because it doesn&#x27;t violate any layering. You don&#x27;t abstract things like indexes and operators into abstract internal APIs because you know at any point what they are.<p>An example of this kind of extremist simplification is how kdb+ stores tables: It memory-maps the entire table file and treats it as an in-memory list. Instead of having to invent a paging mechanism and create functions that work on tuples in pages, they can simply reuse all the vector-oriented K operators, which work on the tuples exactly the way they work on other in-memory lists.<p>I don&#x27;t think I could write K, but it is certainly a source of inspiration when designing systems. We developers have a tendency to pattern-match and generalize, when often &quot;ad hoc&quot; techniques would be better. The old adage is &quot;make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler&quot;, but it&#x27;s actually possible to make things simpler.",1413765838

Store one hash (of all 8 words, sorted), along with an (unencrypted) total function mapping words^7 → words, constructed in such a way as to maximize entropy.  This can be implemented simply by storing an XOR of the (dense) index of all 8 words: XOR the 7 provided words together with the stored XOR to reveal the 8th, then hash all 8 to check the password.<p>(Yes, storing the XOR of the word indices unencrypted reveals information – exactly one word&#x27;s worth of information, which represents knowledge of the 8th word given knowledge of the other 7.  i.e., this knowledge does not reduce the search space below that of 7 sorted words.

In the same way that it’s best to work with a professional graphical designer on the icons and images in your app, it’s best to work with a professional writer on your app’s user-visible text. A skilled writer can help you develop a style of expression that reflects your app’s design, and can apply that style consistently throughout your app.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Comprehensible text is crucial to effective UI. Professional writers and editors should work with software developers on UI text as an integral part of the design process.

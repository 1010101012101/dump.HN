195002,comment,141898,141898,0,0,chutla,,,"Hi Paul:\n   As always your essay is right on the money.  I've worked for big companies and I've worked for small ones, and let me tell you, small is better.  I've heard it described like this.  A big company is like an engine with a monstrous flywheel.  If a couple of cylinders are misfiring (or not firing at all) you really don't even notice.  In fact EVERY cylinder can loaf along at pretty mediocre performance, and the flywheel will still spin.  The problem is, most companies interpret a spinning flywheel as a useful function in itself.  They don't realize there's no useful load attached to the engine.",1211298975

That's what lots of folks do... There are many, many advantages of doing so.<p>You mentioned you needed to bring clients and investors to the office. As someone said, investors often like to see the bootstrapper be creative so you'll get bonus points. Some clients will be put off; others will think it's great - only you know. Sorry if this takes you off the track of your question.<p>To answer your question: you know what the best thing to do is. Asking for advice here is futile since, as you can see, you get so many different types of answers. Trust your instincts; no one knows the business better than you.",1211298945

194997,comment,194380,194380,0,0,Goronmon,,,"<i>To some extent, Apple’s (AAPL) share of this market is growing by default. Companies like HP (HPQ), Dell (DELL) and Lenovo ship enormous quantities of PCs at price points between $500 and $750, whereas the only Macintosh that sells for less than $1,000 is the $599 Mini</i><p>When I first saw the title, this is the first thing that crossed my mind. Apple seems to be in the business of selling expensive computers. I'm not saying this makes their growing market share less valuable, just that it's less of a win then it might seem at face value.<p>Plus, like others have mentioned, this is only for B&M stores.",1211298809

194991,comment,194070,194895,0,0,Tichy,,,"Bias is not the same as ""bias against"", also I never even mentioned IT. What is your problem with bias? Also bias is merely an expectation, not a judgment. If I expect women to have longer hair than men on average, it is not the same as discriminating IT women at the workplace.<p>The way I was quoted, I interpreted as if I have some negative attitude towards women, which is not true.<p>As for women in IT, to be honest I haven't even met one for years now.

Apartments and low-cost housing options have come up in price while homes and higher-cost housing options are a great rent opportunity.<p>Basically, people are migrating toward rentals because they don't want to buy.  That means that well known and easy to find renting options are in higher demand.  But it also means that a lot of nice properties are sitting fallow.  These properties may not be marketed very well--that isn't the focus of the people holding on to them.  So there are great deals to be had in the higher end rental market.<p>We ended up selling our home to move into a town for a short space of time (two years).  We found a beautiful property and have been renting it for only a small percentage of what  PITI would have been, which means that we are paying for a 5 bd 3 bth home in a beautiful neighborhood with a great yard about 10% more than people are paying for 2 bd 2 bth duplexes in mediocre neighborhoods.",1211295830

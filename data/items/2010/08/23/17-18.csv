More over, the single threaded (semantically) writing is an artifact of having append only writing to the db.<p>there are 2 majors wins when you have  this approach to a db.<p>1) append only memory allocation is FAST. If we were talking about writing to ram, its as simple as allocating the interval from i to i + (amount of memory needed), where i is the heap pointer<p>2) you don't have to deal with locks! Locks are not bad per se, but in many cases lock based data structures can lead to pain later on (just look at home much work has been done on python and linux over time in this matter).<p>Also, I believe that in the case that here aren't conflicting versions of the same doc in two couchdb nodes, replication is essentially bandwidth rate limited.<p>take the time to read up on couchdb. it may not be perfect or appropriate for everything, but it is a very very nice piece of software. And whats really awesome is that as a consequence of the append only semantics, the data loss bug they recently had was totally recoverable for those who hadn't compacted their db's!

1627433,comment,1626965,1627369,0,0,jasonjei,,,"I think the issue is the difficulty of auditing electronic votes.  Computers and databases have made it so easy to forge data--just look at Bernie Madoff.<p>The best way to ameliorate these discomforts is to ensure that a list of eligible voters is made available every year (already available under the current system), as well as a list and sum total of those eligible that voted. We would need to assign every voter a UUID every time he votes, and provide the voter a printed receipt of the UUID and selected choices (if desired) on security paper (controlled stock of security paper with its own unique identifier to be accounted for), and publish all election results with the selected choices matched to a UUID on a website every year in CSV and HTML formats.<p>I'm sure there will always be ways to tamper the system. The key is that if every one is able to watch the system (like open source code auditing), the risk of discrepancies or error is minimized. The UUID will allow the voter to confirm that his choices match the recorded results.<p>If this system were implemented, it would be better than the status quo. The current system may seem better, but it's prone to human error (Scantrons not being scanned by an optical reader; hanging chads; etc).",1282585822

I check into Facebook every now and again, and I shouldn't to have to act like a gardener who has ignored his back yard for a month. A lot of status updates are incredibly frivolous too - Facebook's culture is not suited to my taste I guess. Virtually all of my (Facebook) friends are not hacker types and will post ""I'm bored"" or ""feeling tired"" or something equally awe-inspiring. Granted, this is something that Facebook would have never solved as they are trying to appeal to the mainstream, not early adopters. I love the fact that by logging onto HN I often learn something new, and quickly learn to a) write well and b) only talk about stuff you are knowledgeable about. Anything else and you will get caught out pretty quickly.<p><i>(2) The whole thing about the Dunbar number</i><p>This had occurred to me also when writing the original comment, but I didn't mention it as I don't see a decline as inevitable as an online community grows in size - I believe HN is proof of that. By deliberately appealing only to a narrow segment of the internet population through a strict, human-enforced culture (see HN guidelines), and allowing users to only maintain very loose ties if any with each other (contact info in your HN profile for example), it's  possible to have meaningful, no-spam interaction on an online community.  Pg mentioned recently that HN now gets something like 60k uniques per day. I've been on HN for quite a while and I think the quality of article and comments has been consistent over time. I think the Paul Buchheit philosophy of building something that a small number of people <i>love</i>, and that most people would hate (HN), rather than something that tries to appeal to everyone (Facebook) comes into play here.

They all replicate, so you can spread reads and writes over the cluster.  As you add nodes, read performance goes up.  Initial write performance should as well.<p>But when you write to node N, then that data needs to be written to nodes 0-(N-1) as well.   So every write goes to every node (thru replication).   Since writes on CouchDB are syncronous (Eg: only one write at a time) then there is a fixed total write bandwidth on each node.  Since a write on any node needs to be replicated, then, assuming the cluster is using identical machines, the total write speed of the cluster would be the same as the write speed of a single node, right?<p>This is probably not a problem for most cases as reads outnumber writes for web businesses.  But it seems this is an area where couchDB isn't scalable.<p>My assessment is based on the perception that writing data coming via replication is exactly as expensive as writing data coming from the web.  Replicated data goes thru the filters, and replicated data has its views recalculated as well.",1282584670

1627354,comment,1625857,1626558,0,0,stevenbedrick,,,"+1, especially to your last sentence. That right there is my biggest medical informatics pet peeve- a lot of hospitals and clinics have ""analysts"" who are good at using the tools, and maybe even have a good grasp of the data schema of their repositories... but have very limited clinical knowledge, and even more limited knowledge of the workflows that generated their data in the first place.<p>So, what happens is that they generate some numbers without fully understanding the ""story"" behind them. For example, they might get a request for data concerning the frequency with which patients with condition ""X"" are treated at their hospital. In most EHR systems, the way to answer questions like this is by using ICD codes... however, there is rarely a 1:1 relationship between what we might think of as a ""diagnosis"" and a code. Depending on how it's defined, even something seemingly simple such as ""Asthma"" might be represented in an EHR by (for example) a dozen different codes, and which codes are used can depend heavily on a wide variety of factors: how the EHR's designers implemented the diagnosis system and user interface, how the clinicians were trained to use the system, specifics of how the patient's symptoms presented themselves, how the billing department coded the clinicians' diagnoses, the phase of the moon, etc. etc. etc. As a result, instead of a simple query (""find all patients with ICD code A""), the query ends up looking like ""find all patients with codes A, B, C, D, E .... or J; or code K, but only if it co-occurs with L, M, or N; or code O, if the patient was seen in clinic number 4 or 5 between such-and-such dates; etc. etc. etc."" And that's for a simple and straightforward clinical question. Imagine if it was something more complex, like ""how many patients with condition X also develop condition Y after having treatment Z"".<p>Coming up with a query like that takes significant clinical knowledge, but, more importantly, it requires intimate knowledge of the organization that created the data in the first place. It also requires some pretty serious ""people skills""- the clinicians that the analyst will be working with to formulate the question will know virtually nothing about computers or databases, and so it will fall on the analyst to work with the clinicians to elucidate the implications and edge cases of the original question. It's kind of like being a detective. This, by the way, is a big part of why it's so hard to get good--- as in, reliable, valid, and comparable--- quality measures from large health care organizations. The data's often way more complex and ambiguous than novices realize, and (speaking from personal experience, here) it often takes people who come from non-clinical backgrounds and are used to more straightforward analytical questions quite a while to realize just how far down the rabbit hole they've gone. What might seem like<p>Of course the fun doesn't stop once our analyst has finally generated some numbers. Whoever wanted the numbers in the first place  usually doesn't think much about where they came from (cf. ""automation bias""), and as such can go on to make ill-informed decisions as a result of some subtle mistake in the data (i.e., unbeknownst to anybody, the analyst's query missed a whole block of patients coming from a particular clinic, thereby underestimating the prevalence estimates of asthma). This is doubly true when the consumers of the data are generic statisticians (as in, not specialist biostatisticians who are experienced in clinical data analysis) The first commandment of statistics is ""Know thy data"", and medical data is one of those areas where that's a tricker problem than usual.",1282584275

1627322,comment,1626798,1626798,0,0,follower,,,"IMO I think ""The dirty little secret about Google Android"" is that it's not actually as open as people assume it is.<p>Yes, Android is more open than iOS but that's not really saying much.<p>The comparison I tend to make is (""< is less open""):<p><pre><code>  iOS < Android < MeeGo/Moblin/Maemo\n</code></pre>\nIn a similar way to:<p><pre><code>  Windows < OS X < Linux\n</code></pre>\nFor example, while OS X is based on an open platform (FreeBSD) it's got a whole pile of proprietary stuff on top which AFAIK is pretty much how Android operates also (in terms of core applications etc). Not only that but my understanding is that the Android kernel is so different from when it was forked that it is also no straight-forward task to port features (e.g. drivers) from it back to the mainline kernel. And AIUI Google has shown no great desire to anyway.<p>In comparison with Maemo (which I've had more familiarity with than Moblin/MeeGo but assume there's similarities) where Nokia (over time, admittedly) worked with upstream projects and companies to get a lot more of the system into existing open projects.<p>By way of example, ""getting root"" amounted to checking a box, installing a terminal and executing a shell command. All with warranty intact.<p>Getting root on a Nexus One requires voiding your hardware warranty.<p>Without root access you don't even get complete read-only access to your phone's filesystem. That's not open. Even with my proprietary PalmOS Treo 650 I could at least read every single file off the device if I wanted (well, there were some ""no copy"" settings for some apps but I'm not sure if the non-official tools obeyed them anyway). Particularly in this aspect Android is a huge step backwards.<p>Of course, the problem with MeeGo/Maemo/Moblin is that outside of the N900 you can't buy a phone with it--so its openness is somewhat of a moot point.<p>Okay, rant over for now. :)",1282583664

The iPhone did not improve the freedom for the user, but Apple had managed to distinguish between manufacturer and provider.<p>Basically the iPhone (and all the others that would have followed: WebOS, WP7, etc...) had put the manufacturer back in a position of strength: ""Do you want to have a 'modern' mobile on your network? Then don't mess with it"".<p>Once the Android came out though, and it got embraced by Motorola, HTC and Sony, the situation change completely. By far and large there is nothing unique to any Android phone. All manufacturers can access the same CPU, the same screens (actually here Samsung has a slight advantage), etc... This past year has shown the result: a fast dynamic hypercompetitive market.<p>Just like for the PC before, companies were left with only one real way to compete: price. And it's this that has suddenly put the providers back in the driving seat. Verizon can request specific changes (like not-erasable apps) and they either accept them, or they lose the massive subsidies.<p>I don't think Google did this with any bad intention. Indeed, and kind of ironically, it seems to me that the Nexus One was the second step of Google's strategy and was a complete failure _because of it_. Google found itself with no power over the mobile providers: as the article say Verizon waited for a similar speced phone to come out and quickly moved to sell that one instead.<p>Android is in a way so good, that now the mobile phone providers don't need to beg the manufacturers to come to them: they know they will always be able to have custom made Android phones, and Android phones are so good that they can survive without an iPhone or a Pre.<p>In the end I think Google tried to avoid having a new Windows (one OS with a massive market share). But they didn't realised that rather than giving the power to nobody (everyone competing) they gave it to the guys with the money: the providers.",1282583474

233820,comment,233690,233815,0,0,DenisM,,,"You did. I don't know if I can sum it up any better than you, but the message was certainly lost in translation.<p>Let me try anyways:<p>A persistent pattern can be observed: new tech is created, producing endless amusement for many people but with little practical (i.e. monetary) value. Since it's fun and old guys want to feel hip they just pay for it one way or the other.<p>This invention frenzy produces a glut of innovation, soutions in search of a problem. Most of them are even worthless ($-wise) but there are few gems to be found, distilled and reused for some practical purpose. Eventually, build up of useful knowledge reaches critical mass and produces a breakthrough, productive innovation that solves real problems in a new, possibly unrelated area.<p>The author claims that Web 2.0 is one such invention frenzy that has produced a few gems, and one will do well for himself to learn those and build up skill in isolated and combined use. Once so equipped, enterprising hacker will have half of the success in his pocket. Second part will be knowledge of domain areas where people have problems that are waiting for these solutions.",1214974688

233814,comment,233700,233790,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"Not much.<p>The biggest complaints has always been the placement of ads on the invitations and their insistence on drawing you to the site to look at any relevant information (which in turn increases the pageviews and expands their ad inventory). But that's their business model. Few other people have hooked on a more clever way of making money off invitations.<p>These toys that people make, and yes they are just toys, flame out quite quickly despite people clamoring that Evite's evil and so on. Here's a list of other similar services taking on Evite:<p>Mypunchbowl (complete event coordination)<p>Planypus (fuzzy arrangement)<p>Goovite (simplistic invitation system)<p>Invitastic (pretty invite templates)<p>Eventful<p>Imthere<p>Madeit<p>Crush3r (hipster/pretty invite templates)<p>Partee<p>Renkoo (friends getting together)<p>Skobee (dead)<p>Socializr<p>Upcoming<p>Zvents<p>Pownce can also be considered a similar service. Tack on the current trend of location-aware social apps like Loopt and you have another layer. Those apps are likely where these apps will evolve into. Plus the old standbys of email and phones.<p>In the end they all do the same thing: you type in info and it gets sent out, sometimes you get to gussy up the invites. The strategic advantage you have is simply size and inertia. If there's going to be anyone that's capable of crushing Evite it would only be Facebook.",1214973651

The automatic parsing is nice, but for the less web-savvy, a button would be easier to grok.<p>2. The time parsing is a little funky. If I type in 9:30, it auto-detects as PM. If I add a space after that, it suddenly switches to AM. This might catch people off guard.<p>3. The auto date parsing is awesome (with the 'natural language' feature). However, I found that the word 'tonight' doesn't work...perhaps you want to add it to your dict?",1214972174

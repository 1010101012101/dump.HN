4846956,comment,4844786,4845613,2,0,stan_rogers,,,"A better way to put it is that the syntax is neither. There was that whole Danelaw episode to mess up the grammar. Along with word borrowings (which are pretty much inevitable when an adult population--the Viking settlers--is forced into something of a pidgin situation with a related language), there is going to be some damage done to word order and endings/affixes. And since both Old English (or, rather, the Old Englishes--there were regional differences among the Angle-, Saxon- and Jute-dominated areas), a set of languages very much like Old Frisian, and Old Norse were card-carrying Germanic languages with grammatical gender, which is largely arbitrary and the gender assignments didn't align well with each other, grammar simplified. The characteristic German habit of postponing verbs under various circumstances (which also differed between languages) gave way to a more streamlined and generally more consistent SVO. Gender was pretty much abandoned for words that didn't denote things having an actual sex. (Afrikaans underwent a very similar simplification under very different circumstances.) Rather than speaking English words in a Norse grammatical framework, people were speaking a mixture of English and Norse words in a common framework, avoiding the difficult subtleties of either language. But I'd imagine that the children of those Norse settlers (who probably had native British mothers) thought in the hybrid and spoke neither parent's language perfectly.<p>Mainland Scandinavian languages have also simplified somewhat, but in the time <i>since</i> native Norse speakers had a direct influence on English. The Danes that occupied northern Great Britain spoke something that looks and sounds a lot more like Icelandic or Faroese than modern Danish, Swedish or Norwegian. To suggest that the simplification of grammar in mainland Scandinavia after the Norman invasion of Britain is the reason for English's current structure is to posit a sort of quantum entanglement between languages.<p>Correlation is not causation. I still hear mostly English (highly dialectical English, but English of England nonetheless) when I listen to recordings of modern Frisian. I hear something merely related to English when I listen to Scandinavian languages.",1354183113

If near the end of reading line N I highlight from the middle of line N+1 to the middle of line N+2, I can use the one highlight three times to help me track back: first I track back to the first line above the highlight (N+1), second I track back to the highlighted line (N+2), third I track back to the first line under the highlight (N+3).<p>Similarly highlighting multiple lines at a time it's easy to subconsciously remember which line of the selection to read next (first, second, third, ...) without having to visually track back, as long as the selection isn't very long (much like how it's harder to keep track of where you are in a longer paragraph).",1354182156

Techie or not, if you use computers a lot, learning to touch type is worth it, specially considering that if you aren't a techie(i.e you don't need all the special characters), it doesn't take much time to learn.

For some reason this morphed into management material, which it isn't. the whole thing teaches you about the administrative side of running a company. awesome, useful. it does NOT teach anything about making a company successful or how to make people within it successful. it is NOT a management course.<p>so where can one learn management then?<p>1., the product success  side you can't learn anywhere. hence all these shitty companies with shitty products and services. the product side is sort of covered in engineering. technical founders, for example, understand the core principle of what works and what will be an issue down the line. what is right and what is wrong.<p>a generic 'manager' armed with an MBA and technical background of 5 years of XBox Live just doesn't. the concept of 'wrong' or 'down the line' does not exist. excel has no formula for that.<p>2., the people success part is very much a soft skill which needs to be learned through practice in an enforced learning environment. current organisations that do this are the various Armed Forces (NCO and Officers) and similar orgs like the Boy Scouts. some companies emulate this through trainee programs - Siemens has a structured way of giving you a team early on, then giving you challenges. which include firing 2 people from that team after you have worked with them for a while. for real. but now you KNOW first hand how a layoff looks like. not just a spreadsheet anymore.<p>the armed forces gradually give you more responsibility, group, platoon, etc. you have constant feedback loops focusing on your leadership abilities, not just the pure outcome of a task. after action reviews, the whole spiel. nothing grounds you like hearing in an AAR that your team had no clue what you told them, etc.<p>in austria we have technology and crafts-oriented higher colleges, which have an interesting concept. i completed one for constructional engineering. not only do you learn how to calculate a large construction project (both from a structural and a economic side). you actually learn to build it with your own hands. now you KNOW how much work it is to build 1m of brick wall. so shaving off a few minutes per 1m to make a project 'viable' to build 1000m of wall in a week with 5 men doesn't come so easily anymore, because you know that the workers will simply get exhausted and produce errors and accidents. no MBA on earth teaches you this insight. backache and blisters on your hands do. humans are stupid in that way.",1354180596

Imagine if we somehow managed to get rid of the second one. For people working from laptops this is already how it works, but for homes I think it is trickier. Of course there are people who live as techno-nomads already, but they have to swear by a kind of minimalist lifestyle that most people don't want, or that is economically infeasible. How quickly would one need stuff in order to make a JIT lifestyle feasible? For example: Need to host a dinner party? Rent a space with dining facilities and equipment that you need. I think the biggest bottleneck is that you can get these spaces, but you need to sift through many options, and you don't get the equipment that you would have chosen yourself.

Seed capital seems largely useless, my lifestyle is very modest but the realities of childcare and mortgage mean my living expenses are higher than for your typical 20-something. The sums of money available at an early stage wouldn't last long enough to build an MVP, demonstrate traction, then find an angel. I'd have to go back to freelancing, only then I'd have an investor on my back. Bootstrapping seems like the only real option.<p>2. Having worked for 14 years as a developer then manager, I have a pretty good professional network. I've been pleasantly surprised by how easy its been to get work that fits round my startup work. I'm booked till Apr 2013 and turning gigs down at the moment.<p>3. Having kids is a huge time commitment. I simply cannot work at the office for 80 hours or more like some startup people do. However, I share an incubator space with some people like that and without wanting to sound in any way arrogant, I've realised that (a) my time constraints force me to focus really hard, I put in 50 really focused hours a week whereas they sometimes kick back and chat for a while because their energy is low, and (b) I have a lot more experience than them so I'm able to move faster than them on things like how to prep for a meeting with a potential partner or how to architect a system for the future. I think of it like this: if I can't leverage my ten years extra experience on these people to match their output in less time, then I deserve to go bust.<p>3.

If you watch it through to the end, you see the determination, conviction and sincerity that these guys have, which would have put them ahead of anyone else trying to do something similar (eg, Digg, in the long run).<p>No one denies that luck plays a big part in how successful any given startup will turn out to be.<p>But everyone can do things to make their chances of success higher, and the magnitude of that success greater, through the way they conduct themselves and the decisions they make about what they do.",1354179688

If we're comparing reusable apples to apples, this is really the value proposition. I'm clearly more optimistic on this point.<p>Also any engine that uses ram effect becomes more efficient at higher speeds. The SR71 uses less fuel per unit of distance the faster it goes, which is a bit counterintuitive. How big a benefit this is for space launch I can't really guesstimate but it's probably minor.<p>Reaction mass savings means more than just oxidizer material cost though. It ripples through the whole design. There aren't many times when the mass fraction of a rocket is working for you instead of against you.<p>I think we skipped over that a horizontal takeoff requires a lot less launch infrastructure. But being smart with rockets and launching from a barge in the ocean can equalize things.<p>As a summary, I think you and Elon may be right about Skylon for space launch. Mass produced rockets can get pretty cheap, and SpaceX does aspire to full reusability.<p>But space launch is only one of the two applications of a design like Skylon. Nothing SpaceX develops will be used for terrestrial transport. You aren't going to take a rocket to visit your family for the holidays, so Skylon may find a market there.<p>Skylon also could be used as a WhiteKnight style carrier for a more traditional second stage, which might still be interesting for space launch, but I'm pessimistic on this point because I think if the numbers worked the air force would already be using such systems instead of Deltas.<p>Skylon can also hedge that their high flow flash chiller is useful in other applications, and apparently they've developed an interesting high temperature composite material.<p>So on the whole I think it's interesting to watch what happens to them, even if it's not a sure bet.",1354179677

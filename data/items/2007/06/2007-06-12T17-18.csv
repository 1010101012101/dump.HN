27530,comment,27490,27500,0,0,davidw,,,"""You could do this with ANYTHING""<p>I think the answer to that lies in the idea of ""focus"".  Trying to do too much leads either to not being very good at any of it, or worse, architecture astronaut trips into the stratosphere of making things ever more generic and able to handle all kinds of data and odd cases.",1181670757
27529,comment,27453,27508,0,0,davidw,,,"Right... it's not about simply isolating yourself with your real life friends on line.  There's no gain there.  The trick would be to do something like this:<p>The site figures out what you like and adds you to some sort of group with other like minded people.  The members of this group don't change too often, and you principally interact with them, although perhaps you see things of interest to everyone on the site.<p>Shrug... if I had a clear vision of the answer, I'd try and build it:-)",1181670512

However, once I found out that you just click on the city name you detected my entry very well.<p>Like others, I'm wondering what makes a band's name appear more prominent in the tag cloud.  I clicked on the largest name for my area. <p>I don't know why indy vs label delineation is broken out in detail, but genre is not.  Maybe you should show five genres which users can click on as examples before entering their own.<p>You guys found me a show: terance blanchard at Yoshi's in Oakland.  Thanks a lot!",1181668189

Are the larger displayed bands more popular in searches?<p>By the way, I'm not sure why saying ""Rejected YC company"" is of any value. I don't introduce myself as ""Stanford rejected person, Daniel Ha"".",1181667703

So taking an Inuit diet and moving it to Spain would indeed not work, but then taking a diet that works in Spain and moving it to the Arctic won't work either. The food you eat is balanced out by what your daily activities are and vice versa. To that end the modern Western diet does not work well with a modern Western lifestyle, which leads to problems.",1301473217

I say this from experience: you are what you eat. No amount of exercise will do you good if you don't eat clean, fresh, natural food.

But tptacek's point seem to be that this new process addresses the perceived weaknesses of traditional processes by moving all the downsides/risks to the potential employee.

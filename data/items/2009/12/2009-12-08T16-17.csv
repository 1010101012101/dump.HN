For that matter, does government in general scale? Germany (according to Wolfram Alpha) has the largest population in Europe, at 82 million people. America has 300 million. And Germany is much, much more dense, at 613 people per square mile vs our 86 people per square mile.

Secondly, e.g. going to the dentist is almost guaranteed to be an hour's wait (at least where I live), even if you have an appointment. Say, you do have an appointment for 1500, then what many people around here do is, check in at 1455, ask how long the wait might be, and then actually leave to do some shopping or similar and come back in whenever their wait is nearly over.<p>So really, I don't see how this could be superior to any other system..

When people read his quote I think tend to think of embarrassing things they themselves have searched for, but no one is going to subpoena (or even care) about your search for ""nurse + handcuffs"".<p>When I use google I know that there is some probability of the results getting hacked or leaked or subpoenaed or looked at by a google employee trying to improve search. However the expected value of that embarrassment (probability of someone I actually care about seeing it X how embarrassed I would be) is very low, and, for me, doesn't even come close to outweighing the benefit provided by the suite of google products.
On the otherhand (and I think this is Erik's point) if you are using google to do something that would legitimately land you in jail the expected value of bad-stuff is much higher.

Since several years ago I've had tons of idea's for startups I'd like to create.  Problem was, I had a business/finance/network engineer background and had no way of actually building anything.  It's extremely difficult being stuck like that.  Ambitions are polluted by your own limitations.<p>Three years ago a few close friends and I decided to develop a video game using XNA for Xbox 360.  We were three programmers, two artists, and myself who handled game design (not a coder).  It was a simple game.  Basically, you were a guy on a board with a bat and would melee with others, trying to knock them off the board.  It was sorta like Nintendo Hockey crossed with Super Smash Brothers in a top-down 2D view.  Long story short, the programmers lost interest and the project died after two years of part-time work.  The two artists and I were more or less helpless in trying to finish the game, so we had to abandon it.<p>This was a year ago and I was frustrated.  I came to the realization that in order to build something, you need to have the idea, and you need to have a means of building it.  So I ordered a bunch of books and started to teach myself how to program.  Thats enabled me to work on a new startup.<p>Now I can see things much clearer having the ability to write code.  That frustration of not being able to build your ideas, or having their destiny out of your control, is completely gone.  It's empowering.  This quote really rings true to me now:<p><i>The best programmers are the ones that combine in one head both the ability to translate ideas into code and having the ideas.

If you make the wrong thing (if you are blind to the market), you're not going to sell a lot of it.<p>The analogy to the house holds because both a roof and a basement are necessary for a good house. Similarly, both good marketing and good engineering are necessary for a good product. Both are necessary, neither is sufficient on their own.",1260288198

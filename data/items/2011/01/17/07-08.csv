While we support swapping keys with the renter, we don't want to open both parties up to the inconvenience and liability of  handing your keys over to a total stranger.  The carkit provides greater choice to the owner as to how they want to rent out their car (allowing them use a smartphone instead of the physical key), and empowers them to keep better track of how it is used when rented out.<p>On the other, as you put it, technology doesn't solve all these prickly complications -- there are serious operations, customer support and business development problems that must be met in order to make this work.  Insurance is a critical piece in the puzzle, and one that our team has been working on for a year and a half now.

2111525,comment,2109972,2111028,0,0,pyre,,,"You're basically arguing that the convenience of software developers trumps the privacy concerns / ease of use issues with the end-users. As a user, if I want to play Farmville, but I don't want Zygna to have access to my address and phone number I'm 'screwed' because it would be too difficult for Zygna to handle multiple levels of permissions? This would be akin to saying that 'forcing' all e-commerce sites to operate over SSL connections is a 'backwards and conservative move' that 'limits innovation' because developers now need to worry about SSL handshakes and purchasing certificates.<p>The fact is that Farmville doesn't need my phone number or address to allow me to play the game, so why should I (as a user) be presented with an all-or-nothing decision? Your answer seems to be that the reason the user is presented with an all-or-nothing decision is because it would be too difficult for a developer to write some more unit tests. Writing unit tests takes away from time building new features, therefore unit tests stifle innovation (though by this logic bugfixes also stifle innovation).<p>Implementing a permissions system and allowing your program to not need an 'exponential' amount of unit tests is easy+. Just treat everything like a file. Seriously. Treat every piece of data like a file with an ACL allowing certain groups/users to have read/write/no access to the file. It's that easy. Return a standard error when an app tries to perform an operation on a piece of user-data that it doesn't have permissions for. The apps/frameworks should be able to easily handle this.<p>You don't see desktop apps with billions of unit tests just to cover file access. You don't see webapps with billions of unit tests to cover database access (databases also have permission systems). Why would it be so hard for Facebook apps to do the same thing? Why would it require an exponential number of unit tests?<p>As a final note, keeping the barriers to entry low when it comes to (apparently not-so) private user-data is a bad thing. Just look at what the 'ease of use' of PHP's database access did for SQL injection attacks on the web. All developers needed to do was to use bind params, but many of them didn't even know what bind params were. Keeping the barriers low to getting access to users' private data will only result in disaster.<p>+ For various levels of easy.",1295250356

That way, it's strictly more convenient to the user, if they use autofill or whatever, they'll just be subject to the ordinary reCAPTCHA that they would be anyway.<p>I'm imagining listening to mousemove on the document and doing something lightweight like appending the coordinates to an array onmousemove. Then a function that's setInterval'd every 2 seconds or something would flush the array to the server via XHR. A server-side script would, transparently to the user, analyze the mousetrail and if the user appeared to move their mouse realistically and took at least like a minute to fill out the form and took realistic amounts to type in text inputs and so on, the server will let them skip the reCAPTCHA.",1295250010

2111488,comment,2111278,2111278,0,0,cmadan,,,"Hi, I'm a deaf wannabe entrepreneur like you. I use hearing aids. I cannot communicate well i.e. it is impossible for me to assert myself in groups or even in noisy environments like crowded restaurants with individuals or small groups of 2-3. I don't know ASL. I struggle with accents too as I was born and raised in Delhi and moved to USA just one and a half years back for graduate school. I cannot use a phone (use Relay which can be extremely frustrating for the non-deaf person on the other side of the line).<p>I've come to the conclusion that I need a cofounder to pitch my ideas/MVP. It is a bit painful because I love presenting, I've been told I'm a natural. I have no problems pitching my idea, I can speak articulately. The problem comes whenever someone from the audience has a question. I can't hear the question. The workaround is to have them IM the question to me from their laptops but that can be as frustrating as Relay as the conversation isn't really very freeflowing.<p>I also hate groups. I hate socials and parties where I barely know the people there, I'm mostly standing in a group unable to follow the conversation and they end up being really boring. As you can imagine, meetups where I do not know _anybody_ are much worse. But the bottom line is, you need to adopt a different strategy. You need to build up contacts and use email/IM to pitch your idea instead of pitching on the spot. Collect visiting cards/emails.<p>Also remember being deaf, you have a big social network that you can tap in. I developed a MVP for delivering public announcements to phones in textual form (developed a webapp, Android app etc) and through the HLAA (Hearing Loss Association of Florida) I managed to get a meeting with executives from Continental Airlines. At the meeting, my professor at graduate school did the pitching and his pitch was incredible, I just couldn't have done it as well as he. About 80% of my communication with the professor was via email, I met with him face-to-face about just 8-10 times in the 7 month period the project was running (when I had to demo something). All the ideas and progress reports we did it through email. So it all comes down to finding the right cofounder (my professor would check his email every 15 minutes and preferred email to phone and face-to-face meetings with everyone).",1295249039

From my standpoint, it was pretty easy to remember to say, 'go ahead' at the end of a phrase, but, often times, we were in-sync enough that I would get halfway through and would be alerted that he was typing.  Usually Relay was an exceptional case, i.e. I was driving somewhere and SMS or ICQ wasn't possible.  It did mean that he couldn't handle incoming tech support calls, but, 95% of our support calls came in across tickets, livehelp or ICQ (at the time).  I would agree, the people that handle the relay service are almost robotic and often female.<p>We did have clients that never knew he was deaf and were shocked to find out.  I think one time he was working with a client, it was somewhat involved and they requested his number so they could talk with him direct to address an issue.<p>As far as employment goes, I believe some US employers write intentionally vacuous job requirements to exclude groups of people:  Must be able to lift 150 pounds, front-line phone support, ability to distinguish colors, other tasks as assigned.<p>Many employers look for reasons not to hire someone... anything that makes you different can be an impediment.  Regrettable, but, it happens frequently.<p>However, if you have the skills, I don't think most employers would be creeped out and would be willing to conduct a phone interview over an instant messaging platform.  If you've got the skills, a decent employer won't have a problem with accommodating your circumstances.<p>Hopefully we'll be reading about your MVP soon.",1295249017

I performed some superficial testing when I needed to install a simple system that could run a browser on an old computer and I didn't find any noticeable advantage myself. And I have read that lightness is no more a focus of development.<p>I installed several Linux systems consequentially on a USB flash drive, booted my laptop and measured memory consumption at system startup and when running a single instance of Firefox browser pointed to a certain website. Here's what I measured:<p><pre><code>  OS                      | RAM | RAM (w/FF)\n\n  xubuntu 8.04.1            183   (didn't run FF on this)\n  xubuntu 10.04.-RC         157   187\n  ubuntu 10.04-RC desktop   160   228\n  ubuntu 10.04-RC netbook   162   219\n  Tiny Core Linux 2.10       43   (failed to permanently install FF here)\n</code></pre>\nI wanted to try NetBSD and other systems, but I failed to install them on a USB stick.<p>Tiny Core is a special Linux distribution in a way that it doesn't have much of anything installed by default, but you can ""mount"" applications and drivers as you need. I very much appreciate the fact that you are getting ""clean slate"" each time you boot, but in my case I needed to install Firefox permanently, which is doable, but not a default way of doing things. I haven't figured out how to do it, or Tiny Core would be ideal for me.<p>As far as differences between Ubuntu and Xubuntu go, I didn't see any significant advantage of Xfce here. Both systems could  run on a 256 MB system, hardly on 128 MB. On the other hand, I didn't see any disadvantage either. To my eyes, xubuntu system looked very much like ubuntu I use.",1295248657

It's good to have so much rich data, and then to not be able to synthesize and use the data is tough.<p>With our generation of data mining and aggregation, you could approach it by using a data aggregation feed, similar to feedburner, with a ""smart"" priority system. So think of it as a small version of a secretary. The higher up the command call or person you talk to, the default feed is seen first. You can arrange the importance in your settings.<p>The other way to improve massive data overload, is through visualization of data, much like www.bundle.com did with our consumer data from the government quarterly reports. \nVisual data streams would allow soldiers to effectively understand the threats and process more data efficiently in ""chunks"" rather than through reports.",1295248585
2111475,comment,2111420,2111420,0,0,_delirium,,,"Business owners generally cannot count their own time spent on their business as a business expense. Software here is no different than a restaurant owner trying to write off the time it takes him/her to develop a menu, negotiate with suppliers, or manage employees: not allowed. It's assumed that as a business owner, spending your time on the business is what you do, much like as an employee, spending your time on your job is what you do; an employee cannot write off ""time spent on my job"" from their taxes, and you can't write off ""time spent on my business"".<p>One possibility, however, is to pay yourself a salary. Then from the business side, you could write off the salary as a business expense. But now you will pay personal income taxes on the salary. Also, you cannot do this if you're a sole proprietor, and even if you're incorporated, should probably consult with an accountant and/or lawyer to make sure it's legit in your case.",1295248568

If you can speak, I'd suggest getting two phones (at least one blackberry) and fire up an IPRelay call.  Have whoever you want to speak speak into the phone, then you can read the text in close to real time, and speak right back.  You could let the operator know that the call is going to be a multi-person call.<p>I've worked with a bunch of deaf people (i.e. more than 5, most the day).
